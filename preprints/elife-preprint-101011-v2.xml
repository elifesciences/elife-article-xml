<abstract>
<title>Abstract</title><p>G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are integral membrane proteins which closely interact with their plasma membrane lipid microenvironment. Cholesterol is a lipid enriched at the plasma membrane with pivotal roles in the control of membrane fluidity and maintenance of membrane microarchitecture, directly impacting on GPCR stability, dynamics and function. Cholesterol extraction from pancreatic beta cells has previously been shown to disrupt the internalisation, clustering and cAMP responses of the glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R), a class B1 GPCR with key roles in the control of blood glucose levels via the potentiation of insulin secretion in beta cells and weight reduction via the modulation of brain appetite control centres. Here, we unveil the detrimental effect of a high cholesterol diet on GLP-1R-dependent glucoregulation <italic>in vivo</italic>, and the improvement in GLP-1R function that a reduction in cholesterol synthesis using simvastatin exerts in pancreatic islets. We next identify and map sites of cholesterol high occupancy and residence time on active <italic>versus</italic> inactive GLP-1Rs using coarse-grained molecular dynamics (cgMD) simulations, followed by a screen of key residues selected from these sites and detailed analyses of the effects of mutating one of these residues, Val229, to alanine on GLP-1R interactions with cholesterol, plasma membrane behaviours, clustering, trafficking and signalling in pancreatic beta cells and primary islets, unveiling an improved insulin secretion profile for the V229A mutant receptor. This study 1) highlights the role of cholesterol in regulating GLP-1R responses <italic>in vivo</italic>; 2) provides a detailed map of GLP-1R - cholesterol binding sites in model membranes; 3) validates their functional relevance in beta cells; and 4) highlights their potential as locations for the rational design of novel allosteric modulators with the capacity to fine-tune GLP-1R responses.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R), expressed in pancreatic beta cells amongst other tissues including brain, lung, stomach, and heart, is activated by the incretin peptide hormone GLP-1, secreted from enteroendocrine L-cells after food intake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>), to regulate postprandial glucose levels via the potentiation of glucose-dependent insulin secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>). Activation of GLP-1R also promotes beta cell survival, inhibits gastric emptying, regulates food intake and reduces appetite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>), making it a key pharmacological target for various metabolic disorders including type 2 diabetes (T2D) and obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>). Circulation of active GLP-1(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>) hormone is short-lived due to its rapid cleavage into inactive GLP-1(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>) by dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>); peptide analogues of GLP-1 have therefore been developed and successfully used clinically for the treatment of T2D and obesity, including exendin-4, liraglutide, and semaglutide, amongst others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>). Despite their success, access to incretin peptide analogues is challenging for most individuals that require these therapies due to their high cost and complex manufacturing process leading to supply shortages, as well as requirement for refrigeration and administration by injection, together with notable side effects including gastrointestinal disturbances, prompting further research into the development of a new wave of small molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>), including those targeting the receptor as allosteric or ago-allosteric modulators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>).</p>
<p>The GLP-1R is part of the glucagon family of receptors, including the glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide receptor (GIPR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>), the glucagon receptor (GCGR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>), and the glucagon-like peptide-2 receptor (GLP-2R) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>), which are class B1/secretin-like G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) with a typical structure of seven transmembrane domains (7-TMD), a C-terminal tail, and a large N-terminal extracellular domain (ECD) important for peptide agonist binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>). GPCRs transmit extracellular signals via coupling to heterotrimeric G proteins and interactions with β-arrestins, leading to activation of various intracellular signalling cascades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>); the GLP-1R in particular signals preferentially via Gα<sub>s</sub> coupling and adenylate cyclase activation, leading to cAMP accumulation and downstream signal transduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>). Their 7-TMD structure involves intimate interactions with plasma membrane lipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>), known to be non-homogeneously distributed but rather organised in regions known as lipid nanodomains or lipid rafts, enriched in lipid species including sphingolipids and cholesterol, as well as in integral membrane proteins serving as scaffolds for signal transduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>), and GPCR trafficking and sorting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>).</p>
<p>The plasma membrane-enriched lipid cholesterol has been identified as an allosteric modulator for certain GPCRs, due to its direct binding to (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>) and modulation of GPCR activation, trafficking, and signalling patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>). A previous study from our laboratory established that the GLP-1R function in pancreatic beta cells is also modulated by cholesterol. Specifically, we showed that GLP-1R activation leads to receptor segregation into flotillin-positive lipid nanodomains and that disruption of the plasma membrane architecture by cholesterol extraction with methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MβCD) significantly reduces exendin-4-mediated receptor clustering, internalisation, and cAMP accumulation in beta cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>). Here, we focus on identifying the effect of more nuanced changes in cholesterol content on exendin-4-mediated GLP-1R function in primary islets and <italic>in vivo</italic>, followed by mapping of cholesterol binding sites for both apo-state and active receptor structures using coarse-grained molecular dynamics (cgMD) simulations tailored to identify lipid-receptor interactions, and functional validation of a prominent site for its effects on cholesterol binding, plasma membrane behaviours and exendin-4-mediated GLP-1R function in beta cells and primary islets. Our investigation identifies new potentially druggable locations in the receptor, expanding the existing repertoire of functionally relevant sites for the rational design of novel GLP-1R allosteric modulators based on the modulation of receptor-cholesterol interactions.</p>

<title>Changes in cholesterol content modulate exendin-4-induced GLP-1R behaviours in primary islets and in vivo</title>
<p>To determine the effect of increased cholesterol levels on GLP-1R function, we fed mice a standard chow diet supplemented or not with cholesterol for 5 weeks. We then performed intraperitoneal glucose tolerance tests (IPGTTs) post-administration of vehicle or 1 nmol/kg exendin-4 to determine the glucose lowering effect of pharmacologically targeting the receptor under these conditions. Mice on either diet had similar glucose responses under vehicle conditions; however, those on high cholesterol diet presented worse glucose lowering responses to exendin-4 <italic>versus</italic> chow-fed mice (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>, B), an effect that was maintained when normalised to the corresponding vehicle control (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). Islets isolated from high cholesterol-fed mice displayed a near-significant increase in cholesterol (Supplementary Figure 1A) accompanied by decreased exendin-4-induced cAMP responses <italic>ex vivo</italic> (Supplementary Figure 1B), highlighting the negative impact of even mild increases in cholesterol on GLP-1R signalling.</p>

</fig>
<p>To more directly evaluate the effect of increased islet cholesterol content on GLP-1R function, islets isolated from wildtype (WT) mice were loaded <italic>ex vivo</italic> with MβCD saturated with cholesterol, which led to a significant increase in cholesterol content (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>). Under these conditions, we measured a decrease in insulin secretion in response to exendin-4 <italic>versus</italic> vehicle conditions, primarily due to elevated basal secretion levels at 11 mM glucose (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>, F), confirming that increased cholesterol levels reduce the GLP-1R glucoregulatory potential by decreasing its capacity to potentiate islet insulin secretion. This lack of proportional secretory increase following exendin-4 stimulation of cholesterol-loaded islets was not related to an overall saturation of the secretory response, as the percentage of insulin secretion was further increased in both vehicle and cholesterol-loaded islets by stimulation with a secretagogue cocktail (Supplementary Figure 1C). These effects were accompanied by a decreased capacity for exendin-4 to reduce GLP-1R plasma membrane diffusion (Supplementary Figure 1D, E), a behaviour observed here and previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>) by Raster Image Correlation Spectroscopy (RICS) in rat insulinoma INS-1 832/3 cells without endogenous GLP-1R [INS-1 832/3 GLP-1R KO cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>)] stably expressing SNAP/FLAG-tagged human GLP-1R (SNAP/FLAG-hGLP-1R).</p>
<p>We next performed the reverse experiment by decreasing islet cholesterol levels with simvastatin, a long-established hydroxy-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMGCR) inhibitor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>). Filipin staining confirmed decreased islet cholesterol content (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G</xref>), which correlated with increased exendin-4-induced cAMP responses (Supplementary Figure 1F), and exendin-4-induced insulin secretion (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1H</xref>, I) in simvastatin-exposed islets. Contrary to cholesterol loading, simvastatin triggered decreased GLP-1R plasma membrane diffusion under vehicle conditions, measured by RICS as above (Supplementary Figure 1G, H), highlighting the importance of cholesterol in determining GLP-1R movement at the plasma membrane. Taken together, these results demonstrate that changes in cholesterol levels have specific effects on beta cell GLP-1R behaviours, indicating the potential existence of direct interactions between the receptor and this plasma membrane-enriched lipid.</p>

<title>Coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations reveal GLP-1R cholesterol binding sites and state-dependent cholesterol binding modes</title>
<p>To gain insights into the precise location of cholesterol interactions with the GLP-1R, cgMD simulations were employed to study both active (corresponding to agonist bound) and inactive (apo-) states of GLP-1R in a model mammalian plasma membrane using the latest Martini 3 forcefield and cholesterol parameters (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). The PyLipID package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>) was employed to characterise cholesterol interactions for each receptor state. Two key parameters were measured: occupancy, defined as the percentage of frames in the trajectory where any cholesterol molecule is within the cutoff distance from the receptor, and interaction residence time, defined as the time that a cholesterol molecule remains in the binding site, providing information about the strength of the interaction (full data included in Supplementary Tables 1 and 2). Occupancy values for each receptor residue in both states were calculated and displayed as heatmaps, with the top 10 residues per state indicated in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>. The receptor active and inactive states exhibited similar top occupancy residues, with hydrophobic residues such as Phe, Leu, Ile, and Val enriched in both states. A generally similar profile was observed for the top 30 highest occupancy residues in active <italic>versus</italic> inactive states, with some subtle differences noted in the receptor transmembrane domains TM2 and TM6 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>).</p>

Interestingly, notable differences were observed in these sites between the two receptor states: for the active state, site I (purple) was located in the upper TM1 and TM7 region, while in the inactive state, site I (cyan) was found in the lower TM5 and TM6 region, an area which undergoes key structural changes upon G protein engagement and GLP-1R activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>) and might therefore represent a state-specific cholesterol binding site. Site II (orange) was similar for both states but presented subtle differences, with an additional cholesterol pocket involving the Trp in extracellular loop 2 (ECL2) being more pronounced in the inactive <italic>versus</italic> the active state. Site III (green) showed some degree of variation between the two states; in the inactive state, two TM5 residues (Val319 and Phe315) formed an additional cholesterol pocket with TM4, presenting the highest average residence time (186 ns) across all sites, while, in the active state, the cholesterol pocket was located closer to the bottom of TM3 and TM4, involving Leu260 in ECL2.</p>
<p>To evaluate the functional relevance of the GLP-1R cholesterol binding sites identified during the cgMD simulations, 12 residues were selected within or at the periphery of these sites and mutated to alanine by site-directed mutagenesis (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>). Alanine mutations for four of the selected residues (Ile323, Val160, Gly151, and His363) were predicted to cause changes in the GLP-1R structure in the active state by altering the cavity or causing changes in exposed residues and breakages in salt bridges between residues, while a further three alanine mutated residues (Val229, Gly151, and His363) were predicted to cause changes in the inactive GLP-1R structure (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2G</xref>). SNAP/FLAG-tagged human GLP-1Rs (SNAP/FLAG-hGLP-1Rs) with single alanine substitutions for each selected residue were successfully expressed in INS-1 832/3 GLP-1R KO cells with no significant differences detected in cell surface expression levels <italic>versus</italic> WT GLP-1R (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2H</xref>, top graph). Mutant receptors were then screened for their capacity to undergo exendin-4-induced internalisation, as this GLP-1R property is severely inhibited following cholesterol extraction with MβCD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>). Four alanine mutated residues, V229A, V160A, I165A, and L401A, caused a significant decrease in GLP-1R internalisation <italic>versus</italic> WT receptor, with GLP-1R V229A and V160A causing a ∼40%, and I165A and L401A a ∼30% decrease in internalisation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2H</xref>, bottom graph). GLP-1R V229A was selected for further detailed analysis of the effects of modifying a GLP-1R-cholesterol binding site residue on GLP-1R beta cell behaviours.</p>

<p>We next generated INS-1 832/3 GLP-1R KO sublines stably expressing SNAP/FLAG-hGLP-1R WT or V229A. As expected, no difference in surface expression was detected between WT and V229A receptors, although we observed a non-significant tencency for reduced surface levels with the V229A mutant (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>, B). To determine the effect of the V229A substitution on the overall GLP-1R binding to cholesterol in active <italic>versus</italic> inactive conditions, cells from both sublines were labelled with PhotoClick cholesterol and exposed to UV light prior to SNAP/FLAG-hGLP-1R purification by anti-FLAG immunoprecipitation and click chemistry to fluorescently label covalently bound PhotoClick cholesterol (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>).

<p>While we could not measure any changes in receptor conformational shift following exendin-4 binding between GLP-1R WT and V229A (Supplementary Figure 2B, C), or differences in binding affinity to the fluorescent exendin-4 derivative exendin-asp3-TMR (Supplementary Figure 2D), quantification of GLP-1R plasma membrane diffusion using RICS in INS-1 832/3 SNAP/FLAG-hGLP-1R WT <italic>versus</italic> V229A cells revealed a pronounced reduction in GLP-1R V229A diffusion compared to WT GLP-1R under vehicle conditions (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>, B), to a similar extent to the reduction caused by exendin-4 binding to GLP-1R WT, recapitulating the effect triggered by reduced cholesterol levels following simvastatin exposure (Supplementary Figure 1G, H). Single particle tracking (SPT) of human GLP-1R fused to monoclonal EGFP (hGLP-1R-mEGFP) WT <italic>versus</italic> V229A imaged by total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy also showed reduced total displacement and speed (displacement over time) of V229A <italic>versus</italic> WT receptors under vehicle conditions, with these parameters also decreased following WT GLP-1R stimulation with exendin-4 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>). Finally, exendin-4-induced activation of either WT or V229A GLP-1R tended to reduce the diffusion of lipid-ordered nanodomains at the plasma membrane, measured via RICS analysis of generalised polarisation (GP) values obtained from the environmentally sensitive lipid probe Laurdan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>), with no differences in Laurdan GP lateral diffusion in cells expressing WT <italic>versus</italic> V229A receptors. However, RICCS cross-correlation analysis of lipid-ordered nanodomain co-diffusion with GLP-1R WT <italic>versus</italic> V229A showed a reduction in the movement of GLP-1R-lipid nanodomain complexes for WT receptors after exendin-4 stimulation, with a tendency for V229A receptors to exhibit the same behaviour already under vehicle conditions, resulting in no significant change for GLP-1R V229A-lipid nanodomain complex diffusion between vehicle and exendin-4-stimulated conditions (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>, Supplementary Figure 2E).</p>

<p>Number and Brightness (N&amp;B) analysis of the RICCS cross-correlation data was then used to determine the effect of the V229A substitution on receptor oligomerisation before and after exendin-4 stimulation (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). Both WT and V229A receptors existed predominantly as monomers or dimers at a proportion of ∼60 to 80% of total receptors, a percentage that was reduced for the WT receptor at later acquisition times under vehicle conditions, but with otherwise few changes following exendin-4 stimulation. Around 30% of inactive WT or V229A receptors existed as dimers to hexamers or hexamers to decamers, with a tendency for the dimer to hexamer population to reduce and the hexamer to decamer population to increase after exendin-4 stimulation, and for GLP-1R V229A to have a higher proportion of hexamers to decamers under vehicle conditions <italic>versus</italic> WT receptors. A smaller proportion of receptors existed as higher order oligomers, with a significant increase measured for the WT GLP-1R after stimulation with exendin-4. For the GLP-1R V229A, however, we observed a higher proportion of receptors pre-existing as higher order oligomers under vehicle conditions, with no further increases after exendin-4 stimulation, indicating that the mutant receptor has a higher clustering propensity in the inactive state. Consistent with this finding, GLP-1R V229A also presented with significantly increased levels of receptors segregated to lipid rafts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>) prior to exendin-4 stimulation <italic>versus</italic> GLP-1R WT (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>).</p>

However, after exendin-4 stimulation, the receptor association with clathrin-positive regions increased, an effect that correlates with the known rapid GLP-1R internalisation triggered by exendin-4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>), with this increase however significantly less pronounced for the GLP-1R V229A compared to WT (ΔF/S = 0.16 ± 0.006 and 0.10 ± 0.004 for WT <italic>versus</italic> V229A, respectively), in agreement with the reduced internalisation propensity displayed by this mutant receptor (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2H</xref>).</p>

<p>To determine differences between GLP-1R WT and V229A beta cell downstream signalling, cAMP and insulin secretion responses to exendin-4 were investigated in INS-1 832/3 SNAP/FLAG-hGLP-1R WT and V229A. GLP-1R V229A displayed a tendency for increased exendin-4-induced cAMP AUC, with kinetic responses that appeared delayed but reached significantly higher maximal cAMP peak levels (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8A</xref>, B). Compared to WT receptor, GLP-1R V229A caused a significant decrease in basal insulin secretion under vehicle (11 mM glucose alone) conditions (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8C</xref>), which resulted in significantly increased insulin secretion fold-responses to exendin-4 (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8D</xref>). We then determined the effect of GLP-1R V229A in primary mouse islets. To this end, SNAP/FLAG-hGLP-1R WT or V229A-expressing adenoviruses were transduced into islets extracted from mice lacking endogenous GLP-1R expression (GLP-1R KO, generated <italic>in house</italic>). Similarly to the stable INS-1 832/3 sublines, there was no difference in surface expression of GLP-1R WT <italic>versus</italic> V229A in these islets, although again the V229A mutant receptor displayed a tendency for reduced cell surface levels (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8E</xref>, top row and F).

Expression of GLP-1R V229A was again associated with significantly improved insulin secretion fold-increases to exendin-4, but in this case no changes were detected under 11 mM glucose alone conditions, with the improved fold being a consequence of enhanced insulin secretion <italic>versus</italic> WT GLP-1R during the exendin-4 stimulation period (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8H</xref>, I).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we have focused on assessing the potential for modulation of cholesterol interactions as a strategy to control GLP-1R responses in pancreatic beta cells. We have first shown that exogenous cholesterol increases via prolonged dietary changes lead to a decrease in the capacity of the GLP-1R for <italic>in vivo</italic> glucoregulation, without affecting glucose levels under vehicle conditions. Further investigations showed that GLP-1R-mediated cAMP responses were reduced in islets extracted from these mice, suggesting that a high cholesterol diet specifically impacts on beta cell GLP-1R activity. Similarly, acute cholesterol increases in mouse islets exposed to cholesterol-loaded MβCD decreased the GLP-1R capacity to potentiate insulin secretion, validating our observed <italic>in vivo</italic> effects. In agreement with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>), acute (1 hour) beta cell exposure to high cholesterol leads to increased insulin secretion under 11 mM glucose conditions, but the GLP-1R is unable to further potentiate secretion to the same extent than with unmodified cholesterol levels.</p>
<p>While we have observed a direct detrimental effect of a cholesterol-enriched diet on islet GLP-1R cAMP outputs, we cannot rule out that the reduced receptor capacity to lower blood glucose levels following cholesterol loading might encompass further negative effects of high cholesterol on GLP-1R downstream signalling. Persistently elevated mouse islet cholesterol levels have been shown to cause a decrease in the expression of cholesterol synthesis genes (<italic>Hmgcr</italic>) and increased expression of steroidogenic acute and regulatory protein (StAR), while also decreasing glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>). StAR is a steroid biogenesis factor involved in cholesterol transport from the outer to the inner mitochondrial membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>) expressed at low levels in beta cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>), with increased StAR expression linked to reduced beta cell mitochondrial function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>). We (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>), and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>), have shown that the GLP-1R plays an important role in the control of beta cell mitochondrial function, a key process for optimal insulin secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>), with our recent interactome results unveiling direct interactions between GLP-1R and cholesterol biosynthesis and metabolism factors located at ER-mitochondria membrane contact sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>). It is therefore possible that high cholesterol might impact on the capacity of the GLP-1R to regulate mitochondrial and beta cell function via altered expression and interaction with cholesterol regulatory enzymes, hindering the insulin secretion potentiation effect of the receptor.</p>
<p>Conversely, in this study we also found that a reduction in mouse islet cholesterol levels with simvastatin, which disrupts ER cholesterol synthesis by inhibiting HMGCR enzymatic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>), increased exendin-4-mediated cAMP and insulin secretion responses. While this partial reduction in cholesterol levels appears beneficial for beta cell GLP-1R function, we previously observed that a much more drastic cholesterol extraction using MβCD leads to the opposite effect, inhibiting agonist-induced GLP-1R cAMP responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>), a result that we hypothesise is linked to the profound disruption of plasma membrane architecture caused by MβCD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>). The use of statins at higher concentrations than in the present study has been previously associated with varying effects on insulin secretion: simvastatin was shown to reduce, while pravastatin increased insulin secretion in response to glucose, with GLP-1 or exendin-4 exposure restoring secretory responses from statin-treated cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>). Statin use has been associated with increased risk of T2D by poorly understood mechanisms involving both reduced insulin sensitivity and impaired beta cell insulin secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>), the latter ameliorated by GLP-1R agonist exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>). Considering our results as well as previous literature, we speculate that patients with increased cholesterol levels might also exhibit reduced beta cell responses to incretin therapies unless dyslipidaemia is subsequently ameliorated following weight loss. In addition, patients taking cholesterol modifying drugs like statins are particularly good candidates for incretin use as they might present with improved incretin responses that would also help prevent a potentially increased risk of developing T2D in this patient subset. Further research to determine responses to GLP-1R agonists in individuals with different cholesterol levels before and after treatment with cholesterol lowering agents will be required to elucidate this matter.</p>
<p>The GLP-1R, as an integral membrane protein and 7-TMD GPCR, tightly interacts with its lipid-rich plasma membrane microenvironment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>) and is also known to segregate to cholesterol-rich flotillin-positive lipid nanodomains upon activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>). It is therefore plausible that direct interaction of cholesterol molecules with specific binding pockets in the GLP-1R might at least be partially responsible for cholesterol modulation of GLP-1R function. To test this possibility, we performed cgMD simulations of GLP-1R in active <italic>versus</italic> inactive conformations in a model mammalian plasma membrane using the latest Martini 3 forcefield and cholesterol parameters, identifying specific receptor sites with high cholesterol occupancies and residence times. The fact that the highest cholesterol occupancy residues identified correspond to either ring-containing (Phe) or branched (Val, Leu, Ile) amino acids suggests that these residue types might play important roles in cholesterol stabilisation at GLP-1R binding pockets. Importantly, the GLP-1R-cholesterol binding sites identified here do not overlap with previously predicted cholesterol consensus motifs (CCM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>) or Cholesterol Recognition Amino Acid Consensus (CRAC) motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>) identified for other GPCRs, confirming the theory that GPCRs lack predictable primary sequence consensus motifs for cholesterol binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>). The GLP-1R-cholesterol binding sites also presented notable differences between active and inactive receptor conformations, suggesting that cholesterol binding is regulated by agonist binding and receptor activation. GLP-1R in its inactive apo-state is constantly moving but prefers to adopt a closed ECD conformation in absence of peptide binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>). Active, peptide-bound receptors, on the other hand, adopt a more open conformation resulting from the peptide agonist interacting with the ECD, leading to prominent changes at TMD regions which stabilise G protein binding and activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>). The conformational shift between the receptor in active and inactive states is therefore predicted to affect GLP-1R-cholesterol interactions, thereby leading to distinct active <italic>versus</italic> inactive cholesterol binding sites. Interestingly, one of the most prominent GLP-1R-cholesterol binding sites identified here lies within the functionally important TM5-TM6 region required for G protein signal transduction, indicating the potential impact of cholesterol binding on GLP-1R activation and downstream signalling.</p>
<p>To investigate the importance of direct cholesterol interactions in modulating beta cell GLP-1R function, we have screened 12 residues selected from the cholesterol binding sites identified in our cgMD simulations, covering a wide range of occupancy, residence time, ability to tolerate the planned mutation, and varied locations within binding sites in active <italic>versus</italic> inactive states. Interestingly, the residues that had significant effects on GLP-1R internalisation while mutated to alanine were all non-polar branched amino acids, with some of these also predicted to cause changes in the cavity in which they reside. Specifically, changing the Val229 residue to alanine, selected in this study for further investigation, was predicted to trigger a change in the cavity and a buried exposure switch at the inactive receptor, thereby potentially modifying the interactions between itself and other pocket residues with cholesterol.</p>
<p>Further detailed investigations of GLP-1R V229A behaviours in beta cells revealed an overall reduction in cholesterol binding under vehicle conditions, which correlated with reduced lateral diffusion, average displacement, and speed of movement across the plasma membrane of the V229A receptor under these conditions. Detailed examination of the receptor oligomerisation state using N&amp;B also demonstrated a greater population of higher order oligomers under vehicle conditions for the V229A <italic>versus</italic> WT GLP-1R. RICS lateral diffusion takes into consideration the movement of molecules in regions of interest within cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>); the reduced lateral diffusion of GLP-1R V229A could therefore be due to the mutant receptor existing as a subpopulation of pre-clustered, higher order oligomeric assemblies in absence of agonist stimulation, predicted to cause a decrease in the movement of receptors within these clusters. Interestingly, we detected a similar pattern of reduced lateral diffusion of the WT GLP-1R under vehicle conditions following cholesterol lowering with simvastatin, while increased cholesterol led to a reduction in the capacity of exendin-4 to slow down the GLP-1R, suggesting that plasma membrane cholesterol levels, and therefore receptor-cholesterol interactions, are key for the regulation of this behaviour, which in turn determines the capacity of receptors to segregate to lipid nanodomains, modulating downstream signalling responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>). Accordingly, GLP-1R V229A presented with a higher tendency to segregate to flotillin-positive lipid nanodomains, or lipid rafts, in the apo-state, so that the increased clustering of GLP-1R V229A could potentially be triggered by increased mutant receptor partitioning to these nanodomains. This observation also highlights the complexity that modifying a residue within a cholesterol binding site might have on the overall pattern of receptor interactions with cholesterol and other plasma membrane lipids, as increased segregation to these cholesterol-rich lipid rafts occurs despite the overall reduction in total cholesterol binding under vehicle conditions observed for the V229A mutant receptor.</p>
<p>GLP-1R V229A receptor pre-clustering under vehicle conditions did not trigger any measurable changes in the lateral diffusion of plasma membrane lipid-ordered nanodomains measured as a whole using the lipid dye Laurdan, which allows for the detection of different plasma membrane organisation states as either liquid ordered or disordered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>). Laurdan is a non-species-specific lipid probe that cannot discriminate between different lipid nanodomains at the plasma membrane, hence potentially explaining the lack of effect on their overall lateral diffusion by expression of the mutant <italic>versus</italic> WT receptors. We nevertheless observed, by RICCS analysis, a tendency for reduced co-diffusion of these highly packed lipid nanodomains with GLP-1R V229A under vehicle conditions, an effect that is only present in stimulated conditions for the WT receptor, with no further change after agonist stimulation observed for the V229A mutant, again suggesting a different pattern of interaction of V229A <italic>versus</italic> WT GLP-1R with these plasma membrane lipid nanodomains.</p>
<p>Underscoring the importance that direct cholesterol engagement has in the modulation of GLP-1R function, the changes in cholesterol binding and plasma membrane behaviours introduced by the V229A substitution led to significant effects on GLP-1R trafficking and signalling in beta cells: V229A caused a decrease in GLP-1R recruitment to CCPs and receptor internalisation, accompanied by an increase in Gα<sub>s</sub> (measured with mini-G<sub>s</sub>) and β-arrestin 2 engagement, as well as increased plasma membrane recycling following exendin-4 stimulation. Overall, the V229A receptor presented with biased signalling favouring Gα<sub>s</sub> coupling over β-arrestin 2 recruitment and receptor localisation and activation at the plasma membrane. GLP-1R biased signalling also occurs in WT receptors following activation with modified peptide agonists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>). For example, biased GLP-1R signalling is observed following stimulation with exendin-phe1, which carries a phenylalanine substitution at position 1 of exendin-4, causing a similar reduction in receptor internalisation and increased plasma membrane recycling to GLP-1R V229A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>). In contrast, however, exendin-phe1 triggers essentially no β-arrestin 2 recruitment to the receptor, as well as prolonged GLP-1R-induced cAMP and insulin secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>), together with reduced GLP-1R clustering and lipid raft recruitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>), while GLP-1R V229A presents with increased oligomerisation at vehicle conditions and acute effects on beta cell function (summarised in <xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9</xref> and <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Some of these effects are, as previously highlighted, analogous to those observed by reducing beta cell/islet cholesterol with simvastatin: in addition to a reduction in GLP-1R plasma membrane lateral diffusion under vehicle conditions, both manipulations led to acute increases in GLP-1R-induced cAMP and islet insulin secretion responses. While the V229A mutation did not confer an advantage to ameliorate insulin secretion responses to exendin-4 in islets loaded with excess cholesterol <italic>ex vivo</italic>, it remains to be studied if this or another modification in GLP-1R cholesterol binding sites can improve <italic>in vivo</italic> responses to incretin therapies under diet-induced metabolic stress conditions. Regardless, when taken together, the results of this study indicate that modulation of direct GLP-1R-cholesterol interactions is a valid strategy to fine-tune beta cell incretin receptor responses, providing a new avenue for further investigation of novel ways to improve GLP-1R signalling outputs.</p>

<p>The phenomenon of cholesterol modification of GPCR outputs by direct receptor binding has been previously demonstrated for other GPCR classes, especially class A GPCRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref>). For example, cholesterol binding sites were identified in the adenosine A<sub>2A</sub> receptor; mutation of residues within the predicted receptor-cholesterol binding sites caused changes in basal receptor activity, ligand binding, G protein coupling and cAMP responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>). Receptor-cholesterol interactions were also affected by either agonist or antagonist binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref>). Similarly, determining the effect that different agonists and/or antagonists might have on GLP-1R-cholesterol interactions might also provide further valuable insights into their specific mechanisms of action. Additionally, it would be highly pertinent to study the effects of modifying GLP-1R cholesterol binding sites in other cell types that express the receptor beyond pancreatic beta cells/islets, specifically in neurons where the receptor plays important roles in the control of satiation and nausea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref>), which might be modulated by modified receptor-cholesterol interactions.</p>
<p>Our results serve as a first for a class B1 GPCR, highlighting the importance of GPCR-lipid interactions on receptor function and dynamics for this receptor class. It further confirms cholesterol binding pockets as high value sites for GLP-1R allosteric modulation, with the capacity to fine-tune GLP-1R trafficking, signalling and functional outputs. Further investigations to fully elucidate the effect of the V229A substitution on GLP-1R-cholesterol interactions might include detailed atomistic MD simulations of WT <italic>versus</italic> V229A receptors, as well as resolving cryo-EM structures of mutant and WT receptors in nanodiscs containing relevant lipid compositions to preserve receptor-lipid interactions in their native environment. Large cgMD simulations including increased numbers of WT or mutant receptors in a membrane environment with varying cholesterol levels could also be performed to determine the effect of cholesterol on GLP-1R oligomerisation. Finally, further high-throughput investigations to evaluate all other key residues involved in GLP-1R-cholesterol binding will generate high value data for the future development of novel GLP-1R allosteric modulators with improved signalling properties for the treatment of T2D and obesity.</p>

Cells were washed with PBS and imaged in RMPI 1640 medium without phenol red using the confocal settings of a Leica Stellaris 8 STED FALCON in an 86X objective and a 10% power 405 nm excitation laser and emission ranges of 420-460 nm (blue emission, IB) and 470-510 nm (red emission, IR) for Laurdan, plus a 5% power 647 nm excitation laser for SNAP-Surface Alexa Fluor 647. The general polarisation (GP) formula (GP = IB-IR/IB+IR) was used to retrieve the relative lateral packing order of lipids at the plasma membrane: values of GP vary from 1 to −1, with higher values reflecting lower fluidity (or higher lateral lipid order), whereas lower values indicate increased fluidity. Two hundred consecutive frames were captured for 2.45 minutes at a pixel size of 80 nm and a format size of 256×256 pixels. Cells were imaged under vehicle conditions and after stimulation with 100 nM exendin-4. Further analysis was carried out using the SimFCS 4 Software to determine the RICCS cross-correlation between Laurdan GP values and SNAP/FLAG-hGLP-1R. Specifically, Ch2-Ch1 (B1-B2 map) RICS analysis of brightness (intensity of fluorescence signal) in one channel cross-correlates with brightness in the second channel, allowing for the calculation of cross-correlation.

Prior to imaging, cells were labelled at 37°C with 5 μM SNAP-Surface 549 probe for 30 minutes in full media and washed. Microscopy was performed on a custom-built TIRF microscope based on a Zeiss Axiovert 135 with DPSS lasers at 405, 491 and 561 nm, 100X/1.45 NA objective. Colour channels were split using a Dualview (Optical Insights) and projected side by side onto an EMCCD camera (QuantEM:512SC, Photometrics). Still images were acquired by sequential excitation with the 473 and 561 nm lasers.

Exendin-4 (100 nM) was added for at least 10 minutes to trigger receptor endocytosis. Calibration and alignment were performed using 100 nm polystyrene beads (Molecular Probes). To quantify SNAP/FLAG-hGLP-1R association with clathrin, circular ROIs surrounding individual well defined puncta of fluorescence (5-50 per cell) were selected on CLC-GFP images and transferred to the corresponding SNAP ones using a Fiji macro and average fluorescence per pixel was measured in a central circle (c) of diameter 5 pixels (0.55 µm) at each puncta location, in a surrounding annulus (a) with an outer diameter of 7 pixels (0.77 µm), and in an area not containing any cell as background (bg). The specific cluster-associated fluorescence ΔF was calculated by subtracting the annulus value from that of the circle (ΔF = c-a).

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors demonstrate impairments induced by a high cholesterol diet on GLP-1R dependent glucoregulation in vivo as well as an improvement after reduction in cholesterol synthesis with simvastatin in pancreatic islets. They also map sites of cholesterol high occupancy and residence time on active versus inactive GLP-1Rs using coarse-grained molecular dynamics (cgMD) simulations, and screened for key residues selected from these sites and performed detailed analyses of the effects of mutating one of these residues, Val229, to alanine on GLP-1R interactions with cholesterol, plasma membrane behaviour, clustering, trafficking and signalling in pancreatic beta cells and primary islets, and describe an improved insulin secretion profile for the V229A mutant receptor.</p>
<p>These are extensive and very impressive studies indeed. I am impressed with the tireless effort exerted to understand the details of molecular mechanisms involved in the effects of cholesterol for GLP-1 activation of its receptor. In general, the study is convincing, the manuscript well written and the data well presented. Some of the changes are small and insignificant which makes one wonder how important the observations are. For instance, in Figure 2E (which is difficult to interpret anyway because the data are presented in per cent, conveniently hiding the absolute results) does not show a significant result of the cyclodextrin except for insignificant increases in basal secretion. That is not identical to impairment of GLP-1 receptor signaling!</p>
<p>To me the most important experiment of them all is the simvastatin experiment, but the results rest on very few numbers and there is a large variation. Apparently, in a previous study using more extensive reduction in cholesterol the opposite response was detected casting doubt on the significance of the current observation. I agree with the authors that the use of cyclodextrin may have been associated with other changes in plasma membrane structure than cholesterol depletion at the GLP-1 receptor. The entire discussion regarding the importance of cholesterol would benefit tremendously from studies of GLP-1 induced insulin secretion in people with different cholesterol levels before and after treatment with cholesterol-lowering agents. I suspect that such a study would not reveal major differences.</p>
<p>Comments on revisions: The authors have responded well to my criticism.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this manuscript the authors were providing a proof of concept that they can identify and mutate a cholesterol-binding site of a high-interest class B receptor, the GLP-1R, and functionally characterize the impact of this mutation on receptor behavior in the membrane and downstream signaling with the intent that similar methods can be useful to optimize small molecules that as ligands or allosteric modulators of GLP-1R can improve the therapeutic tools targeting this signaling system.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The majority of results on receptor behavior are elucidated in INS-1 cells expressing the wt or mutant GLP-1R, with one experiment translating the findings to primary mouse beta-cells. I think this paper lays a very strong foundation to characterize this mutation and does a good job discussing how complex cholesterol-receptor interactions can be (ie lower cholesterol binding to V229A GLP-1R, yet increased segregation to lipid rafts). Table 1 and Figure 9 are very beneficial to summarize the findings. The lower interaction with cholesterol and lower membrane diffusion in V229A GLP-1R resembles the reduced diffusion of wt GLP-1R with simv-induced cholesterol reductions, by presumably decreasing the cholesterol available to interact with wt GLP-1R. The effects of this mutation are not due to differences in Ex-4:recepotor affinity. I think this paper will be of interest to many physiologists who may not be familiar with many of the techniques used in this paper and the authors largely do a good job explaining the goals of using each method in the results section. While not necessary for this paper, a comparison of islet cholesterol content after this cholesterol diet vs the more typical 60% HFD used in obesity research would be beneficial for GLP-1 physiology research broadly to take these findings into consideration with model choice.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>There are no obvious weaknesses in this manuscript and overall, I believe the authors achieved their aims and have demonstrated the importance of cholesterol interactions on GLP-1R functioning in beta-cells.</p>
<p>Certainly many follow-up experiments are possible from these initial findings and of primary interest is how this mutation affects insulin homeostasis in vivo under different physiological conditions. One of the biggest pathologies in insulin homeostasis in obesity/t2d is an elevation of baseline insulin release (as modeled in Fig 1E) that renders the fold-change in glucose stimulated insulin levels lower and physiologically less effective. Future work by the authors may determine the effects of the GLP-1R V229A mutation on insulin secretion responses under diet-induced metabolic stress conditions. Furthermore, the authors may additionally investigate if V229A would have the same impact in a different cell type, especially in neurons, with implications in the regulation of satiation, gut motility, and especially nausea, which are of high translational interest.</p>
<p>The comparison is drawn in the discussion between this mutation and ex4-phe1 to have biased agonism towards Gs over beta-arrestin signaling. Ex4-phe1 lowered pica behavior (a proxy for nausea) in the authors previously co-authored paper on ex4-phe1 (PMID 29686402) and drawing a parallel for this mutation or modification of cholesterol binding to potentially mitigate nausea is a novel direction.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors demonstrate impairments induced by a high cholesterol diet on GLP-1R dependent glucoregulation in vivo as well as an improvement after reduction in cholesterol synthesis with simvastatin in pancreatic islets. They also map sites of cholesterol high occupancy and residence time on active versus inactive GLP-1Rs using coarse-grained molecular dynamics (cgMD) simulations and screened for key residues selected from these sites and performed detailed analyses of the effects of mutating one of these residues, Val229, to alanine on GLP-1R interactions with cholesterol, plasma membrane behaviour, clustering, trafficking and signalling in pancreatic beta cells and primary islets, and describe an improved insulin secretion profile for the V229A mutant receptor.</p>
<p>These are extensive and very impressive studies indeed. I am impressed with the tireless effort exerted to understand the details of molecular mechanisms involved in the effects of cholesterol for GLP-1 activation of its receptor. In general, the study is convincing, the manuscript well written and the data well presented.</p>
<p>Some of the changes are small and insignificant which makes one wonder how important the observations are. For instance, in figure 2 E (which is difficult to interpret anyway because the data are presented in percent, conveniently hiding the absolute results) does not show a significant result of the cyclodextrin except for insignificant increases in basal secretion. That is not identical to impairment of GLP-1 receptor signaling!</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We assume that the reviewer refers to Figure 1E, where we show the percentage of insulin secretion in response to 11 mM glucose +/- exendin-4 stimulation in mouse islets pretreated with vehicle or MβCD loaded with 20 mM cholesterol. While we concur with the reviewer that the effect in this case is triggered by increased basal insulin secretion at 11 mM glucose, exendin-4 appears to no longer compensate for this increase by proportionally amplifying insulin responses in cholesterol-loaded islets, leading to a significantly decreased exendin-4induced insulin secretion fold increase under these circumstances, as shown in Figure 1F. We interpret these results as a defect in the GLP-1R capacity to amplify insulin secretion beyond the basal level to the same extent as in vehicle conditions. An alternative explanation is that there is a maximum level of insulin secretion in our cells, and 11 mM glucose + exendin-4 stimulation gets close to that value. With the increasing effect of cholesterol-loaded MβCD on basal secretion at 11 mM glucose, exendin-4 stimulation would then appear to work less well.</p>
<p>We have performed a simple experiment to investigate this possibility: insulin secretion following stimulation with a secretagogue cocktail (20 mM glucose, 30 mM KCl, 10 µM FSK and 100 µM IBMX) in islets +/- MβCD/cholesterol loading to determine if maximal stimulation had been reached or not in our original experiment. This experiment, now included in Supplementary Figure 1C, demonstrates that insulin secretion can increase up to ~4% (from ~2%) in our islets, supporting our initial conclusion. We have also included absolute insulin concentrations as well as percentages of secretion for all the experiments included in the study in the new Supplementary File 1 to improve the completeness of the report.</p>

<p>We agree with the reviewer that the insulin secretion results in vehicle <italic>versus</italic> LPDS/simvastatin treated mouse islets (Figure 1H, I) are relatively variable. We have therefore performed 2 extra biological repeats of this experiment (for a total n of 7). Results now show a significant increase in exendin-4-stimulated secretion with no change in basal secretion in islets pre-incubated with LPDS/simvastatin.</p>

<p>We agree with the reviewer that such study would be highly relevant. While this falls outside the scope of the present paper, we encourage other researchers with access to clinical data on GLP-1R agonist responses in individuals taking cholesterol lowering agents to share their results with the scientific community. We have highlighted this point in the paper discussion to emphasise the importance of more research in this area.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>

<p>The majority of results on receptor behavior are elucidated in INS-1 cells expressing the wt or mutant GLP-1R, with one experiment translating the findings to primary mouse beta-cells. I think this paper lays a very strong foundation to characterize this mutation and does a good job discussing how complex cholesterol-receptor interactions can be (ie lower cholesterol binding to V229A GLP-1R, yet increased segregation to lipid rafts). Table 1 and Figure 9 are very beneficial to summarize the findings. The lower interaction with cholesterol and lower membrane diffusion in V229A GLP-1R resembles the reduced diffusion of wt GLP-1R with simv-induced cholesterol reductions, although by presumably decreasing the cholesterol available to interact with wt GLP-1R. This could be interesting to see if lowering cholesterol alters other behaviors of wt GLP-1R that look similar to V229A GLP-1R. I further wonder if the authors expect that increased cholesterol content of islets (with loading of MβCD saturated with cholesterol or high-cholesterol diets) would elevate baseline GLP-1R membrane diffusion, and if a more broad relationship can be drawn between GLP-1R membrane movement and downstream signaling.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Membrane diffusion experiments are difficult to perform in intact islets as our method requires cell monolayers for RICS analysis. We however agree that it is of interest to investigate if cholesterol loading affects GLP-1R diffusion. To this end, we have performed further RICS analysis in INS-1 832/3 SNAP/FLAG-hGLP-1R cells pretreated with vehicle or MβCD loaded with 20 mM cholesterol (new Supplementary Figures 1D and 1E). Interestingly, results show significantly increased plasma membrane diffusion of exendin-4-stimulated receptors, with no change in basal diffusion, following MβCD/cholesterol loading. This behaviour differs from that of the V229A mutant receptor which shows reduced diffusion under basal conditions, a pattern that mimics that of the WT receptor under low cholesterol conditions (by pre-treatment with LPDS/simvastatin).</p>

<p>We have expanded on the rationale behind the use of Laurdan to assess behaviours of lipid packed membrane nanodomains in the methods, results and discussion of the revised manuscript.</p>

<p>I found it unclear what exactly was being measured to assess 'receptor activity' in Fig 7E and F.</p>
<p>Figures 7E and F refer to bystander complementation assays measuring the recruitment of nanobody 37 (Nb37)-SmBiT, which binds to active Gas, to either the plasma membrane (labelled with KRAS CAAX motif-LgBiT), or to endosomes (labelled with Endofin FYVE domain-LgBiT) in response to GLP-1R stimulation with exendin-4. This assay therefore measures GLP-1R activation specifically at each of these two subcellular locations. We have included a schematic of this assay in the new Supplementary Figure 3 to clarify the aim of these experiments.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Certainly many follow-up experiments are possible from these initial findings and of primary interest is how this mutation affects insulin homeostasis in vivo under different physiological conditions. One of the biggest pathologies in insulin homeostasis in obesity/t2d is an elevation of baseline insulin release (as modeled in Fig 1E) that renders the fold-change in glucose stimulated insulin levels lower and physiologically less effective. No difference in primary mouse islet baseline insulin secretion was seen here but I wonder if this mutation would ameliorate diet-induced baseline hyperinsulinemia.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We concur with the reviewer that it would be interesting to determine the effects of the GLP1R V229A mutation on insulin secretion responses under diet-induced metabolic stress conditions. While performing <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments on glucoregulation in mice harbouring the V229A mutation falls outside the scope of the present study, we have included <italic>ex vivo</italic> insulin secretion experiments in islets from GLP-1R KO mice transduced with adenoviruses expressing SNAP/FLAG-hGLP-1R WT or V229A and subsequently treated with vehicle <italic>versus</italic> MβCD loaded with 20 mM cholesterol to replicate the conditions of Figure 1E in the new Supplementary Figure 4.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>I would have liked to see the actual islet cholesterol content after 5wks high-cholesterol diet measured to correlate increased cholesterol load with diminished glucose-stimulated inulin. While not necessary for this paper, a comparison of islet cholesterol content after this cholesterol diet vs the more typical 60% HFD used in obesity research would be beneficial for GLP-1 physiology research broadly to take these findings into consideration with model choice.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have included these data in Supplementary Figure 1A.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Another area to further investigate is does this mutation alter ex4 interaction/affinity/time of binding to GLP-1 or are all of the described findings due to changes in behavior and function of the receptor?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>To answer this question, have performed binding affinity experiments, which show no differences, in INS-1 832/3 SNAP/FLAG-hGLP-1R WT <italic>versus</italic> V229A cells (new Supplementary Figure 2D).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Lastly, I wonder if V229A would have the same impact in a different cell type, especially in neurons? How similar are the cholesterol profiles of beta-cells and neurons? How this mutation (and future developed small molecules) may affect satiation, gut motility, and especially nausea, are of high translational interest. The comparison is drawn in the discussion between this mutation and ex4-phe1 to have biased agonism towards Gs over beta-arrestin signaling. Ex4-phe1 lowered pica behavior (a proxy for nausea) in the authors previously co-authored paper on ex4-phe1 (PMID 29686402) and I think drawing a parallel for this mutation or modification of cholesterol binding to potentially mitigate nausea is worth highlighting.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>While experiments in neurons are outside the scope of the present study, we have added this worthy point to the discussion and hypothesise on possible effects of GLP-1R mutants with modified cholesterol interactions on central GLP-1R actions in the revised manuscript.</p>

<p>I view this as an excellent manuscript with very comprehensive work and clear translational relevance. I don't think any further experiments are needed for the scope outlined in this manuscript. The discussion is already long but a short postulation on how this may translate to GLP-1R-cholesterol interactions in other cell types, specifically neurons with the intent on manipulating satiation and nausea, could be worthwhile.</p>

<p>The only thing for readability I would suggest is a sentence in the results mentioning why you're doing the Laurdan analysis, and what is the output for assessing 'receptor activity' in the membrane and endosomes.</p>
