<abstract>
<title>Abstract</title><p>Enterobacteriaceae bacteria are prone to opportunistic pathogenic behavior during gut dysbiosis, potentially influenced by distinct environmental cues within the compromised gut. Chemosensing systems play a central role in allowing bacteria to perceive and react to physicochemical signals within the gastrointestinal (GI) milieu, influencing their motility, population organization, and colonization site preferences. We investigated the chemosensory behavior of Enterobacteriaceae, a bacterial family associated with gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding and sepsis, to learn whether these bacteria respond to human serum, a chemical stimulus they encounter during GI bleeding. We discover that clinical isolates of diverse non-typhoidal <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> serovars, <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, and <italic>Citrobacter koseri</italic> all sense human serum as a potent attractant. Using a custom injection-based microfluidics device we simulated GI bleeding and found that femtoliter volumes of human serum are sufficient to stimulate motile cells to rapidly swim toward, and congregate at, the serum source. With exceptional temporal resolution, we determined that this response is orchestrated through chemotaxis, with a major chemical cue driving chemoattraction being L-serine, an amino acid abundantly present in serum, recognized by the chemoreceptor Tsr. To gain deeper insight into the structural basis of this phenomenon, we successfully elucidated the crystal structure of <italic>Salmonella</italic> Typhimurium Tsr in complex with L-serine. This structure allowed for a precise characterization of the ligand-binding site, thereby correcting prior misconceptions regarding L-serine positioning and accurately defining the chemoreceptor’s ligand-binding interactions. Building upon these structural insights, we identified a conserved amino acid recognition motif for L-serine shared among Tsr orthologues and mapped the phylogenetic distribution of this chemoreceptor. We found that Tsr, which mediates serum chemoattraction, is widely conserved among Enterobacteriaceae and many World Health Organization priority pathogens associated with bloodstream infections. Given that Enterobacteriaceae are a primary cause of bacteremia and sepsis, particularly as a complication of inflammatory bowel diseases, their remarkable sensitivity to serum as a chemoattractant could relate to their proclivity for bloodstream entry.</p>

<title>Summary of Updates:</title>
<fn fn-type="update"><p>This revised manuscript focuses on serum chemoattraction mediated by chemoreceptor Tsr and how our crystal structure of Salmonella enterica Typhimurium Tsr provides insights into its molecular function. We wanted to discuss the new context of L-serine chemoattraction as a molecular cue in serum. Our previous submission focused on the implications of serum chemoattraction and its link to sepsis. However, based on feedback from other researchers in the field, we have shifted the focus of the paper to the molecular mechanisms of serum chemoattraction. We have also revised Figure 6 to remove panel D, which depicts a model of pathogenesis that is no longer the main focus of the paper.</p></fn>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Bacteria use chemosensory systems to survey and navigate their environments <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. In the exceptionally dynamic environment of the host gut, peristalsis and flow constantly perturb the microscopic physicochemical landscape. Key to responding to such transient and shifting stimuli is that chemosensing allows bacteria to rapidly restructure their populations, within seconds, to be attracted toward, or repelled away from, effector sources <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>. Enteric pathogens and pathobionts use chemosensing to colonize specific tissues, based on sources of exogenous nutrients, toxins, and host-emitted cues, through control of motility and adhesion systems such as chemotaxis, chemokinesis, twitching, and biofilm formation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. Notably, most bacterial genera classified by the World Health Organization (WHO) as ‘priority pathogens’ employ sophisticated chemosensory systems for efficient infection and exert precise control over their colonization topography <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. These include multidrug-resistant Enterobacteriaceae pathogens of the gut such as <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic>, Enterohemorrhagic <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (EHEC), <italic>Citrobacter koseri</italic>, and <italic>Enterobacter cloacae</italic>, which present major challenges for nosocomial infections and global health <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>The signals that enteric bacteria perceive through chemosensing are most comprehensively understood in the context of colonizing of a healthy gut, a state referred to as eubiosis. These signals include host-emitted amino acids indicating proximity to a host <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>, quorum-sensing molecules from the microbiome that convey intra- and inter-species information <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>, and urea emanating from tissue that direct bacteria out of the lumen and into contact with the epithelia <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. However, gut dysbiosis, induced by pathologies, inflammation, and infections, exposes enteric bacteria to novel and distinct chemical stimuli that may drive their behavior towards opportunistic pathogenesis <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. While it is well-established that bacterial chemosensing enhances colonization and persistence within the gut <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>, our understanding of which host-emitted cues are responded to by pathogens and pathobionts in the diseased and compromised gut remains limited. Furthermore, most studies on bacterial chemosensing employ assays that neglect the rapid temporal dimension fundamental to how these responses confer advantages in the dynamic gut environment. Investigating how chemosensing governs the swift responses of pathogen populations to unique chemical features associated with dysbiosis presents an opportunity to gain deeper insights into bacterial behaviors that influence the critical juncture between infection resolution and exacerbation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>.</p>

<p>In a diseased gut, enteric bacteria may encounter a distinctive host-derived chemical feature not found in a healthy gut – GI bleeding. The microenvironment of an enteric hemorrhagic lesion involves a source of serum, the liquid component of blood, emanating from the host tissue and diffusing into the intestinal lumen (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). In effect, this creates a microscopic gradient, i.e., a microgradient, of chemicals flowing outward from a point source that may serve as chemosensory signals for luminal bacteria. Enteric infections caused by Enterobacteriaceae species can lead to GI bleeding, a condition associated with a significant risk of mortality. Although GI bleeding isn’t a typical outcome of enteric infection, it is a substantial burden on human health, affecting around 40-150 out of every 100,000 individuals annually, with a fatality rate ranging from 6% to 30% of cases (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>. Notably, Enterobacteriaceae are prone to bloodstream entry, and are a leading cause of sepsis-related deaths in individuals with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>. Despite the established connection between Enterobacteriaceae virulence and GI bleeding, it remained unknown whether these bacteria perceive serum through chemosensing.</p>
<p>Serum is a complex biological solution with components that may enhance, or hinder, bacterial growth. On one hand, it offers a rich reservoir of nutrients for bacteria: sugars and amino acids at millimolar concentrations <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>. Additionally, it contains essential metals like iron and zinc. On the other hand, serum contains host factors that inhibit bacterial proliferation in the bloodstream such as cathelicidin, defensins, and the complement system <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>. Consequently, how enteric pathogens and pathobionts would respond to serum exposure remained unclear. To address this open question, we employed an injection-based live-imaging system to simulate GI bleeding with human serum <italic>in vitro</italic> and measure bacterial chemosensing responses with high temporal resolution. We initially focused on non-typhoidal serovars of the human enteric pathogen <italic>S. enterica</italic> as exemplars of Enterobacteriaceae that can cause GI hemorrhaging and sepsis (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). These serovars are responsible for approximately 1.35 million infections each year and possess chemosensory systems characteristic of Enterobacteriaceae <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>. Subsequently, we studied the chemosensing responses of the Enterobacteriaceae species <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>C. koseri</italic> to human serum. Across all examined scenarios, we observe these bacteria to exhibit a remarkable sensitivity and attraction towards human serum. This phenomenon is an example of how stimuli unique to the environment of a diseased gut may promote, through chemosensing, emergent bacterial behaviors that can adversely impact host health, and may relate to the propensity of Enterobacteriaceae to invade the bloodstream.</p>

<title>Use of the chemosensory injection rig assay (CIRA) to study polymicrobial chemosensing behaviors</title>
<p>To model features of enteric bleeding <italic>in vitro</italic>, we utilized an experimental system to inject minute quantities of human serum into a pond of motile bacteria and observe real-time responses by microscopy (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). The system and methodology, which we refer to herein as the chemosensory injection rig assay (CIRA), offers several advantages for studying bacterial chemosensing and localization in response to serum: (1) we can use bona fide human serum, (2) the readouts are direct measurements of real-time localization dynamics of the bacterial population, and (3) similar to a bleeding event, a source of fresh serum is continuously emitted. By employing multichannel fluorescence imaging of differentially labeled bacterial populations we observe polymicrobial interactions through head-to-head comparisons of bacterial behavior within the same experiment.</p>

<p>The CIRA microgradient is established through injection at a constant rate of ∼300 femtoliters per minute, through a 0.5 µm glass microcapillary, and expands over time from diffusion (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>-<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">B</xref>, <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1</xref>). To approximate the diffusion of serum metabolites we developed a mathematical model for the CIRA microgradient based on the three-dimensional differential diffusion equation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>, <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1</xref>, Method Details). From this model, we calculate that the introduction of a minute volume of novel effector produces a steep microgradient, in which a millimolar source recedes to nanomolar concentrations after diffusion across only a few hundred microns (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>, <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1</xref>). For instance, we expect a bacterium 100 µm from a 1 mM infinite-volume source to experience a local concentration of a small molecule effector (diffusion coefficient approximately 4 x 10<sup>−6</sup> cm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup> s<sup>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>) of 10 nM after 300 s of injection (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>, <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1</xref>). To visualize the microgradient experimentally, we utilized Alexa Fluor 488 dye (A488) and observed the microgradient to be stable and consistent across replicates (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>-<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">D</xref>, Movie S1). We found no behavioral differences in treatments with buffer in the range of pH 4-9, indicating small, localized pH changes are inconsequential for taxis in our system, and that any artifactual forces, such as flow, account for only minor changes to bacterial distribution at the population level, in the range of ±10% (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1</xref>).</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<title>Non-typhoidal S. enterica serovars exhibit rapid attraction to human serum</title>
<p>We first studied the chemosensing behaviors of <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium IR715, which is a derivative of ATCC 14028, originally isolated from domesticated chickens, and is used extensively in the study of <italic>Salmonella</italic> pathogenesis (Table S1)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>. As treatment, we utilized commercially-available human serum that was not heat-inactivated nor exposed to chemical or physical treatments that would be expected to alter its native complement properties (see Materials &amp; Methods). We assessed the response of motile IR715, containing a fluorescent mPlum marker, to a source of human serum over the course of 5 minutes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref>, Movie S1). During this timeframe, we witnessed a rapid attraction response whereby the motile bacterial population reorganized from a random distribution to one concentrated within a 100-150 µm radius of the serum source (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref>-<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">F</xref>, Movie S1). To compare responses between CIRA experiments, we plotted data as either the relative number of bacteria within 150 µm of the treatment (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2F</xref>, left panel) or a radial distribution of the population (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2F</xref>, right panel) over time. By these measures we determined <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium IR715 is attracted to human serum. The bacterial population in proximity to the serum source doubles by 40 s, reaches a maximal attraction rate by 90 s, and approaches equilibrium by 300 s post-treatment (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2G</xref>).</p>
<p>To test whether serum attraction is relevant for <italic>Salmonella</italic> strains that infect humans, and if responses differ among non-typhoidal <italic>Salmonella</italic> serovars, we employed dual-channel CIRA imaging to compete <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium IR715 against representative clinical isolates of Typhimurium (SARA1), Newport (M11018046001A), and Enteriditis (05E01375). These serovars are the most common in North American infections <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>. In varying magnitude, all strains showed attraction responses to human serum, seen as a significant distribution bias toward the serum source relative to the experiment periphery (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2H</xref>-<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">J</xref>, Movie S2). Together, our data show <italic>S. enterica</italic> serovars that cause disease in humans are exquisitely sensitive to human serum, responding to femtoliter quantities as an attractant, and that distinct reorganization at the population level occurs within minutes of exposure (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2H</xref>-<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">J</xref>, Movie S2).</p>

<title>Chemotaxis and the chemoreceptor Tsr mediate serum attraction</title>
<p>Serum is a complex biological solution containing a variety of sugars, amino acids, and other metabolites that could serve as attractant signals <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. Based on the rapid attraction of motile, swimming bacteria to the treatment source, characteristic of chemotactic behaviors <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>, we hypothesized serum to be perceived through the chemotaxis system, and that one or more of these chemical components could be specifically recognized as chemoattractants through the repertoire of chemoreceptors possessed by <italic>Salmonellae</italic> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). Based on current understanding of chemoreceptor-chemoattractant ligand interactions <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>, we identified three chemoreceptors that could mediate serum chemoattraction: (1) taxis to serine and repellents (Tsr), which responds to L-serine, and reportedly also norepinephrine (NE) and 3,4-dihydroxymandelic acid (DHMA); (2) taxis to ribose and glucose/galactose (Trg), which responds to glucose and galactose; and (3) taxis to aspartate and repellents (Tar), which responds to L-aspartate (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). We modeled the local concentration profile of these effectors based on their typical concentrations in human serum (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>). The two most prevalent chemoattractants in serum are glucose (5 mM) and L-serine (100-300 µM) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>-<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">F</xref>), which suggested the chemoreceptors Trg and/or Tsr could mediate serum attraction.

<p>To test the role of chemotaxis in serum attraction, we competed wildtype (WT) <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium IR715 against a chemotaxis-null isogenic <italic>cheY</italic> mutant, which possesses swimming motility but is blind to chemoeffector signals (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3G</xref>, Movie S3). Whereas the WT mounts a robust attraction response to serum, the <italic>cheY</italic> mutant population remains randomly distributed (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3G</xref>, Movie S3). We also observed the <italic>cheY</italic> mutant to exhibit a slight decline in cells proximal to the treatment source over time, which we attribute to cellular crowding effects from the influx of WT cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3G</xref>, Movie S3). In this background, the fraction of WT cells within 100 µm of the serum source increases by 70-fold, with maximal rate of attraction achieved by 120 s post treatment. Thus, we determined that chemotaxis, i.e., chemoattraction, is namely responsible for the rapid localization of <italic>S. enterica</italic> to human serum.</p>
<p>We next analyzed strains with deletions of the chemoreceptors <italic>trg,</italic> or <italic>tsr,</italic> to test the roles of these chemoreceptors in mediating serum chemoattraction. Surprisingly, we found the <italic>trg</italic> strain to be non-motile (data not shown). Because motility is a prerequisite for chemotaxis, we chose not to study the <italic>trg</italic> mutant further, and instead focused our mechanistic investigations on Tsr. We compared chemoattraction responses in dual-channel CIRA experiments between the WT and <italic>tsr</italic> mutant and observed an interesting behavior whereby both strains exhibited chemoattraction, but the <italic>tsr</italic> mutant distribution was relegated to a halo at the periphery of the WT peak (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3H</xref>, Movie S3). The WT efficiently outcompetes the <italic>tsr</italic> mutant such that by 5 minutes post-treatment the ratio of WT to <italic>tsr</italic> cells proximal to the serum source is 3:1 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3H</xref>, Movie S3). Similar to <italic>cheY</italic>, we presume the <italic>tsr</italic> halo results from cellular crowding effects induced by the high density of WT cells near the serum source. To test how the <italic>tsr</italic> mutant responds to serum in the absence of a strong competitor, we compared chemoattraction between <italic>tsr</italic> and <italic>cheY</italic>. In this background, <italic>tsr</italic> chemoattraction remained diminished relative to that of WT, but the <italic>tsr</italic> distribution shifted closer to the serum source (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3I</xref>, Movie S3). These results led us to conclude that the mechanism underlying serum chemoattraction involves the chemoreceptor Tsr and acts through one, or more, of the chemoattractants recognized by Tsr that is present in serum: L-serine, NE, or DHMA.</p>

<title>S. enterica exhibits chemoattraction to L-serine, but not NE or DHMA</title>
<p>We next sought to identify the specific chemoattractants driving Tsr-mediated serum chemoattraction. Suspecting that one effector might be L-serine, we took advantage of the fact that Tsr can only bind L-serine, and treated the serum with serine racemace, an enzyme that converts L-to D-serine. Comparing responses to serum, versus serum treated with serine racemace, showed that the latter decreased chemoattraction, with the localization of bacteria becoming more diffuse (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2</xref>). We next used CIRA to examine responses to purified effectors diluted in buffer. The concentration of L-serine in human serum ranges from approximately 100-400 µm, depending on diet and health factors <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>, whereas the neurotransmitter NE, and its metabolized form, DHMA, are thought to circulate at approximately 10 nM <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>. Nevertheless, it has been proposed that NE and/or DHMA are sensed directly by Tsr with nanomolar affinity <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>. We used CIRA to test the response of <italic>S. Typhimurium</italic> IR715 to L-serine, NE, and DHMA. We observed robust chemoattraction responses to L-serine, but no detectable response to either NE or DHMA (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2</xref>, Movie S4-6). We attempted additional CIRA experiments with cells cultured according to prior work, which included culturing the cells with NE before chemotaxis experiments, but ultimately saw no evidence to suggest <italic>S. enterica</italic> responds chemotactically to NE or DHMA (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2</xref>, Movie S5-6). Together, these data indicate the chemoattractant in serum sensed through Tsr is L-serine.</p>
<p>Chemoattraction to L-serine has mostly been studied in the context of model laboratory strains and has not been rigorously evaluated for <italic>S. enterica</italic> clinical isolates or various serovars. To establish whether L-serine sensing is relevant for human infections, we used dual-channel CIRA to compare taxis to L-serine between <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium IR715 and clinical isolates (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>-<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">C</xref>, Movie S4). In each case we observe robust chemoattraction, though there are differences in sensitivity to L-serine. The magnitude of chemoattraction was highest for <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium SARA1 and <italic>S.</italic> Newport, whereas <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium IR715 and <italic>S.</italic> Enteriditis showed lower responses, which could relate to the different host specificities of these serovars and strains (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>-<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">C</xref>, Movie S4).</p>

<p>We next used CIRA to test a range of L-serine sources spanning five orders of magnitude to define whether the concentrations of L-serine present in human serum are sufficient to drive a chemoattraction response. Within the 5 min timeframe of our experiments, the minimal source concentration of L-serine needed to induce chemoattraction is 0.5-5 µM. The [L-serine] required for half maximal chemoattraction (i.e., K<sub>1/2</sub>) is approximately 105 µM (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref>-<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">E</xref>, <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3</xref>). Based on our microgradient modeling, this corresponds to a local L-serine concentration of 4.35 nM for bacteria 100 µm from the source (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1</xref>, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>). To gain further insights into the dynamics of L-serine chemoattraction, we monitored chemotactic behavior in the presence of L-serine, and then removed the treatment (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4F</xref>). These experiments showed maximal attraction and dispersal rates to be similar, changing by approximately 4% per second (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4F</xref>). These findings emphasize the rapid dynamics through which chemotaxis can influence the localization of bacteria in response to microscopic gradients of chemoeffectors.</p>
<p>To substantiate our findings, we considered some alternative explanations for our data. First, we tested whether Tsr alone was required for chemoattraction to L-serine, or whether some other chemoreceptor, or form of taxis, such as energy or redox taxis, might contribute to the responses. However, we found when treated with L-serine, the <italic>tsr</italic> mutant showed no chemoattraction and behaved similarly to the chemotaxis-null <italic>cheY</italic> mutant (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4G</xref>). Second, we considered the possibility that the defect in serum chemoattraction of the <italic>tsr</italic> mutant could be due to pleiotropic effects of the <italic>tsr</italic> deletion on chemotaxis signaling or motility, similar to the inhibited swimming motility of the <italic>trg</italic> mutant. We tested the ability of the <italic>tsr</italic> strain to respond to another chemoattractant, L-aspartate, which is sensed through the Tar chemoreceptor (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). We found that the <italic>tsr</italic> mutant mounted a robust chemoattraction response to 500 µM L-aspartate, similar in magnitude and rate to WT (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4G</xref>), supporting that chemotaxis to non-serine stimuli remains functional in the <italic>tsr</italic> strain. Together, these data support that the mechanism of Tsr-mediated chemoattraction to serum is through direct recognition of L-serine.</p>

<title>Serum provides a growth advantage for non-typhoidal S. enterica serovars</title>
<p>The robust serum chemoattraction response conserved across diverse <italic>Salmonella</italic> serovars suggests serum, and L-serine present in serum, could be a source of nutrients during infection. Yet, serum also contains complement proteins and bactericidal factors, such as defensins and cathelicidin, that could inhibit bacterial growth <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>. To address this, we investigated whether active human serum provides a growth benefit for <italic>Salmonella</italic> when diluted into minimal media. In all strains surveyed, we found that serum addition enhances growth, and we saw no evidence of killing even for the highest serum concentrations tested (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4H</xref>-<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">K</xref>). The growth enhancement required relatively little serum, as 2.5% v/v was sufficient to provide a 1.5-2.5-fold growth increase (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4H</xref>-<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">K</xref>).</p>
<p>Since L-serine is not only a chemoattractant, but also an important nutrient for bacteria in the gut <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>, we hypothesized the growth benefit could be directly from L-serine. We determined by mass spectrometry that our human serum samples contain 241 µM +/-48 total serine (L-and D-enantiomers), of which approximately 99% is expected to be L-serine <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup> (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Fig. S4</xref>). We attempted to treat human serum with a purified recombinant enzyme that degrades L-serine, serine dehydrogenase (SDS), to see whether serine-depleted serum would elicit less growth or chemoattraction. However, these treatments did not alter serum serine content relative to untreated samples, and so we abandoned this approach (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Fig. S4</xref>). Instead, we performed a titration of purified L-serine and assessed its role in supporting a growth advantage. We found that only a very small benefit is achieved with the addition of L-serine, which did not recapitulate the larger growth benefit seen for serum addition (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4H</xref>-<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">K</xref>). This leads us to believe that L-serine functions as a molecular cue that directs <italic>Salmonella</italic> toward serum, but nutrients present in serum other than L-serine provide the growth advantages.</p>

<title>Structure of S. enterica Tsr in complex with L-serine</title>
<p>We next undertook structural studies to understand the specific recognition of L-serine by Tsr.

<p>We recognized that in the prior <italic>Ec</italic>Tsr study, the methods described exchanging the protein crystal into a glycerol cryoprotectant. We hypothesized that during the glycerol soak serine leached out of the crystal leaving the binding site partially occupied, and caused the electron density to be weak for the ligand and binding region. To capture a complex with a fully-bound ligand site we grew crystals of the soluble periplasmic portion of the <italic>Se</italic>Tsr LBD with L-serine, at a high salt concentration that would serve as a cryoprotectant without further manipulation, and harvested crystals directly from drops so as to prevent leaching of the ligand from the binding site. Following extensive crystallization trials, we identified a single <italic>Se</italic>Tsr LBD crystal that diffracted to high resolution (2.2 Å) and was of sufficient quality for structure determination (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>, Table S2).</p>

<title>Molecular recognition of L-serine by SeTsr</title>
<p>The higher resolution (+0.3 Ǻ) of the <italic>Se</italic>Tsr structure, and full occupancy of the ligand, provide a much-improved view of the interactions that facilitate specific recognition of L-serine (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5F</xref>-<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">G</xref>). Using non-crystallographic symmetry averaging, we leveraged the five independent <italic>Se</italic>Tsr monomers to generate a well-defined 2f<sub>o</sub>-f<sub>c</sub> map of the L-serine ligand and residues involved in ligand coordination (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5F</xref>, Movie S7). Omit-map difference density, which is calculated in the absence of a modeled ligand and reduces potential bias in the electron density map, was fit well by the placement of the L-serine ligand (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5F</xref>). In this orientation, the ligand is in an optimal energetic conformation that satisfies all possible hydrogen bonding interactions: the positively-charged peptide amine donates hydrogen bonds to the backbone carbonyl oxygens of Phe151, Phe152, and Gln154, the negatively-charged ligand carboxyl group donates hydrogen bonds to the Arg64 guanidinium group, the Asn68 side change amine, and a water (W2), and the ligand hydroxyl sidechain donates a hydrogen bond to the Asn68 sidechain oxygen, and accepts a hydrogen bond from a water (W1) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5F</xref>, Movie S7). All five chains of the <italic>Se</italic>Tsr structure are consistent in the positions of the ligand and surrounding residues (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5F</xref>, Movie S7).</p>
<p>With the aid of the improved view provided by our <italic>Se</italic>Tsr structure, we noticed the L-serine to be positioned differently than modeled into the weak density of the <italic>Ec</italic>Tsr structure (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5F</xref>-<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">G</xref>, Movie S7). The <italic>Ec</italic>Tsr structure has the serine positioned with the sidechain hydroxyl facing into the pocket toward Asn68, and the orientations of Asn68, Phe152, Asp153, and Gln157 ligand binding pocket are modeled inconsistently between the two <italic>Ec</italic>Tsr chains in the asymmetric unit (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5G</xref>). Calculating f<sub>o</sub>-f<sub>c</sub> omit map density for both structures shows clear support for our new <italic>Se</italic>Tsr ligand orientation, and an overlay with the <italic>Ec</italic>Tsr f<sub>o</sub>-f<sub>c</sub> omit map data indicates this orientation would also fit well the electron density for that structure (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5H</xref>-<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">I</xref>). Thus, the data in both <italic>S. enterica</italic> and <italic>E. coli</italic> Tsr structures support a revised orientation of the ligand in which the L-serine side chain hydroxyl faces outward from the pocket and toward the solvent.</p>

<title>SeTsr LBD binds L-serine, but not NE or DHMA</title>
<p>Despite a lack of chemotactic responses to NE and DHMA in our CIRA experiments (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2</xref>, Movie S5-6), our uncertainty lingered as to whether these neurotransmitters are sensed through Tsr. Prior work created theoretical models of NE and DHMA binding <italic>Ec</italic>Tsr at the L-serine site, and proposed this as the molecular mechanism underlying <italic>E. coli</italic> chemoattraction to these compounds <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>. However, with our new experimentally-determined <italic>Se</italic>Tsr LBD crystal structure in hand, it is clear that the hydrogen bonding network is specific for L-serine (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5F</xref>, Movie S7), and we were doubtful such dissimilar ligands as NE or DHMA would be accommodated. We note that the amino acids that constitute the L-serine binding pocket are identical between <italic>Se</italic>Tsr and <italic>Ec</italic>Tsr (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5F</xref>-<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">G</xref>), and so at the protein level <italic>Se</italic>Tsr LBD and <italic>Ec</italic>Tsr LBD should have similar molecular functions and ligand specificity.</p>
<p>Despite several studies reporting a direct role of Tsr in directing chemoattractant responses to NE and DHMA, no direct evidence of ligand-binding has ever been presented. Thus, we performed isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) experiments, a gold-standard for measuring protein-ligand interactions, to study ligand recognition by <italic>Se</italic>Tsr LBD (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5J-L</xref>). As expected, L-serine produced a robust exothermic binding curve, exhibiting a K<sub>D</sub> of approximately 5 µM (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5J</xref>). This matches well with our observation of <italic>S. enterica</italic> chemoattraction requiring a source of L-serine at least 0.5-5 µM (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref>-<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">E</xref>) and with prior ITC data with <italic>Ec</italic>Tsr LBD, which also reported a 5 µM K<sub>D</sub><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup>.

<title>Bacteria with tsr genes perform serum chemoattraction</title>
<p>The biological distribution of Tsr chemoreceptors has not been previously characterized. We hypothesized that chemoattraction to serum, mediated through Tsr, might extend beyond <italic>Salmonella</italic> to other bacterial species. We applied our structural insights to define a motif consisting of the amino acids involved in L-serine recognition, and when we analyzed the genomes of Enterobacteriaceae genera such as <italic>Escherichia</italic>, <italic>Citrobacter</italic>, and <italic>Enterobacter,</italic> found that they too possess Tsr-like chemoreceptor genes (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5M</xref>). We next conducted a comprehensive search for chemoreceptor genes containing the L-serine recognition motif, resulting in the creation of a database containing all organisms that possess putative Tsr orthologues (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5N</xref>, Data S1). The biological distribution of Tsr reveals the chemoreceptor to be widely conserved among Gammaproteobacteria, particularly within the families Enterobacteriaceae, Morganelliaceae, and Yersiniaceae (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5N</xref>). We identified that many WHO priority pathogens are among the species that have Tsr, leading us to suspect these pathogens and pathobionts also perform serum chemoattraction.

Here, we have investigated how bacterial chemosensing functions to respond to a source of serum, a chemical feature enteric bacteria only encounter in the event of GI bleeding.</p>
<p>We demonstrated that human serum is a potent chemoattractant, and nutrient source, for Enterobacteriaceae bacteria known for instigating enteric bleeding during infection, and that are causal agents of bacteriemia and sepsis (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>-<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>-<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). Pathologies that compromise the integrity of the GI tract, such as intestinal intra-abdominal abscesses, microperforations, and fistulas associated with IBD, predispose patients to GI bleeding and bacteremia <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref></sup>. In a broader context, the rapid chemoattractive behavior of Enterobacteriaceae to serum fits into an emerging picture of how host-emitted factors in the diseased gut can drive bacterial tropism for sites of inflammation and injury (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref></sup>. This behavior is responsible for accumulation of bacteria at lesions, which exacerbates tissue damage, delays wound healing, and increases risk of systemic infection <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref></sup>. Given the above lines of evidence, bacterial serum chemoattraction could be a risk factor for developing systemic infections.</p>

<title>New contexts for L-serine chemoattraction</title>
<p>We show here that the bacterial chemoattraction response to human serum is robust and rapid; the motile population restructures within 1-2 minutes of serum exposure and the cells increase in density to the point of saturation at the serum source (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>). We expect that serum chemoattraction occurs through the cooperative action of multiple bacterial chemoreceptors that perceive several chemoattractant stimuli, but a primary driver of this phenomenon appears to be the chemoreceptor Tsr through recognition of L-serine (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). While Tsr is known as a bacterial sensor of L-serine <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref></sup>, the physiological sources of L-serine in the gut sensed by Tsr have not been well-defined. One major source is clearly dietary; however new research has raised the possibility that L-serine from damaged tissue may play an important role in diseased gut environments to drive opportunistic pathogenesis. In a recent study using a dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-colitis model to investigate L-serine utilization by Enterobacteriaceae, L-serine was identified as a critical nutrient that provides metabolic and growth advantages in the inflamed gut <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup>. Further, colitis was found to stimulate large increases in the luminal availability of most amino acids and average serine content nearly doubled <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup>. A characteristic feature of the DSS-colitis model is fecal bleeding <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref></sup>, and so the enrichment of amino acids as a result of DSS treatment, including serine, may be attributable to leakage of host metabolites from serum. That pathogenic Enterobacteriaceae are poised to leverage growth advantages from L-serine during colitis may relate to their highly sensitive and rapid chemoattraction to this effector emitted from human serum.</p>
<p>Our structural and molecular studies of the <italic>Salmonell</italic>a Tsr LBD confirm that this chemoreceptor is aptly named and that the ligand-binding site is highly optimized, and selective, for recognition of L-serine (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>-<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). Although the host-derived metabolites NE and DHMA have been reported to be chemoattractants sensed through Tsr, we were unable to reproduce these results in chemotaxis experiments nor binding assays with the purified recombinant protein (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2</xref>, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5K</xref>-<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">L</xref>). Our inability to substantiate a structure-function relationship for NE/DHMA signaling indicates these neurotransmitters are not ligands of Tsr. In contrast, L-serine drove chemoattractant responses to a source as low as 500 nM, a binding K<sub>D</sub> of 5 µM was established through ITC, and was captured in complex in the <italic>Se</italic>Tsr LBD crystal structure with clearly-defined electron density (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>). Interestingly, the well-resolved ligand binding site in this new structure shows the L-serine position was misinterpreted in prior studies, which may necessitate some revisions in understanding how ligand occupancy stimulates signal transduction to CheA and across the chemoreceptor nanoarray (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>). This structure was also helpful in accurately defining the residues central to L-serine recognition, allowing us to mine genomic databases and report the first extensive characterization of which bacterial species possess Tsr orthologues (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>). From this database of Tsr sequences we were able to visualize the distribution of Tsr orthologues across biology, which strikingly are enriched among Enterobacteriaceae, but are also present in several other families that include WHO priority pathogens (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5N</xref>, Data S1). This analyses confirms that the bacterial species most commonly associated with bacteremia in patients with IBD possess the Tsr chemoreceptor (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 N</xref>, Data S1) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>In the context of <italic>Salmonella</italic> pathogenesis, it is interesting to note that diverse serovars, which vary in terms of host specificity and epidemiology, exhibit serum chemoattraction and have the ability to utilize serum as a nutrient (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2H</xref>-<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">J</xref>, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4H-K</xref>). The specific nutrients responsible for the growth benefits derived from serum remain undefined, however one potential candidate is the presence of energy-rich glycoconjugates, which were previously implicated as nutrients in the inflamed intestine based on the upregulation of galactose utilization operons and the prevalence of lectin-positive stained tissue <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref></sup>. Enteric Peyer’s patches are primary invasion sites for non-typhoidal <italic>Salmonella</italic>, and these structures are situated close to vasculature that can be damaged through the pathogen’s destruction of microfold (M) cells, causing localized bleeding <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref></sup>. <italic>S. enterica</italic> Typhimurium uses the chemoreceptor Tsr to locate and invade Peyer’s patches <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>, which could involve L-serine chemoattraction originating from serum or necrotic cells. Although GI bleeding is relatively uncommon in <italic>Salmonella</italic> infections overall, it afflicts 60% of infected children under the age of five <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref></sup>. Therefore, while we acknowledge that serum chemoattraction is unlikely to be involved in the routine pathogenesis strategy of <italic>Salmonella</italic>, the significant number of bacterial-induced GI bleeding cases, and the association between GI bleeding and bacterial invasion into the bloodstream, provide opportunities for serum chemoattraction to be involved in infection outcomes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref></sup>.</p>

Transformants were isolated through growth on selective media and stored as glycerol stocks for subsequent use. To prepare motile bacterial cells for chemotaxis experiments, bacterial cultures were grown shaking overnight in 2-5 ml tryptone broth (TB) and 50 µg/ml ampicillin (TB+Amp) at 30° C or 37° C, as needed. The following day, 25 µl of overnight culture was used to inoculated 25 ml of fresh TB+Amp and grown shaking for 3-5 hours to reach optical density 600 (OD<sub>600</sub>) of approximately 0.5. To better isolate responses to effectors of interest and remove confounding variables, such as pH variation and quorum-signaling molecules, we washed and exchanged the cells into a buffer of defined composition.

<title>Chemosensory injection rig assay (CIRA)</title>
<p>Our CIRA system is based on prior work, with several notable changes to methodology, as described. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref></sup>. The CIRA apparatus was constructed using a pump for injection (either a refurbished Eppendorf Transjector 5246 or Femtojet 4i) and universal capillary holder, with solutions injected through Femtotip II glass microcapillaries (Eppendorf), and the microcapillary position controlled with a MP-285 micromanipulator (Sutter) at a 30° angle of attack. To generate a microgradient, a constant flow from the microcapillary was induced by applying compensation pressure (P<sub>c</sub>) of 35 hPa. The stability of the microgradient under these conditions was determined with Alexa488 dye (ThermoFisher), and the flow was determined empirically with methylene blue dye to be approximately 300 femtoliters per minute at 30° C (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1</xref>). Pooled off-the-clot human serum was obtained from Innovative Research; serum was deidentified and had no additional chemical additives and is presumed to be fully active. Treatment solutions were filtered through a 0.2 µm filter and injected as-is (serum) or diluted in CB (serine, aspartate, NE, DHMA). Serine racemase treatment of serum was performed with the addition of 5 µl of proprietary serine racemase solution from a DL-serine assay kit (Abcam) to 1 ml of serum for 3 h. For each CIRA experiment, a fresh pond of 50 µl of motile bacteria was mounted open to air on a 10-well slide (MP Biomedicals), and the microcapillary containing the treatment of interest was lowered into the pond. Bacterial responses were imaged with an inverted Nikon Ti2 Eclipse microscope with an enclosed heated sample chamber. Temperature of experiments were at 37 °C, unless otherwise indicated.</p>

<title>CIRA microgradient modeling</title>
<p>Diffusion is modeled as a 3D process in which the diffusive species is slowly and continuously introduced at a fixed point in a large ambient fluid volume. The species to be injected is prepared at concentration <italic>M<sub>s</sub></italic> (typically in the range of 0.5 µM-5 mM) and is injected at a volume rate Q = 305.5 fl/min. The species diffuses into the ambient fluid with diffusion constant D. The governing equation for the diffusion of a species introduced continuously at a point source is:

where <italic>r</italic>, is the distance from the point source, <italic>t</italic>, is the time from injection initiation, and <italic>q</italic> = <italic>M<sub>s</sub>Q</italic> is the injection rate of the species, and <italic>C</italic> is the species concentration.

<p>Initial crystallization trials of <italic>Se</italic>Tsr LBD were performed with either TEV-cleaved or uncleaved protein samples at 7 mg/ml with +/-2 mM L-serine and using 96-well matrix screens set up with a Mosquito robot (SPT Labtech). We only observed crystal hits with the cleaved, serine-treated crystals, the best of which was 0.056 M sodium phosphate, 1.344 M potassium phosphate, pH 8.2. This condition was further optimized to be 1.5 µl <italic>Se</italic>Tsr LBD protein (7 mg/ml), 0.5 µl of 8 mM L-serine, and 1.5 µl 1.69 M potassium phosphate pH 9.7, grown via hanging drop vapor diffusion with a 1 ml reservoir of 1.69 M potassium phosphate pH 9.7 at 22° C. Attempts at using cryoprotectants were unsuccessful and resulted in crystals dissolving or diminished diffraction, so crystals were scooped directly from drops and flash frozen in liquid N<sub>2</sub>. X-ray diffraction data were collected at the Berkeley Advanced Light Source (ALS) beamline 5.0.3.

Flow was measured through injection of known concentrations of methylene blue dye, diluted in CB, into a 50 µl pond of CB over 20 minutes. After treatments, the absorbance of solutions was measured at 665 nm and quantified based on a standard curve. Applying a compensation pressure of 35 hPa resulted in an average flow of 305.5 fl/min ± 31. B. CIRA localization in response to treatments of buffered CB of different pH. C.

<p>This work uses an interdisciplinary approach combining microfluidics, structural biology, and genetic analyses to provide <bold>valuable</bold> findings that show that pathogenic enteric bacteria exhibit taxis toward human serum. The data are <bold>solid</bold> and show that the behavior utilizes the bacterial chemotaxis system and the chemoreceptor Tsr, which senses the amino acid L-serine. The work provides an ecological context for the role of serine as a bacterial chemoattractant and could have clinical implications for bacterial bloodstream invasion during episodes of gastrointestinal bleeding.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Glenn et al. present solid evidence that both lab and clinical Enterobacteriaceae strains rapidly migrate towards human serum using an exciting approach that combines microfluidics, structural biology, and genotypic analysis. The authors succeed in bringing to light a novel context for the role of serine as a bacterial chemoattractant as well as documenting what is likely to be a key step in bloodstream entry for some of the main sepsis-associated pathogens during gastrointestinal bleeding. They aim to expand their conclusions from a single lab serovar of Salmonella enterica to a range of clinical serovars and other species within the Enterobacteriaceae family. This is a powerful approach that greatly increases the scope of their findings but I find that some of their conclusions here are not always supported by strong evidence.</p>
<p>I would also like to note that, while I enjoyed the interdisciplinary scope of this study, I am personally not well positioned to review the protein structural aspects of this work.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
- The authors first characterise migration towards serum in detail using a well-characterised lab strain but one of the main strengths of this study is that they then expand their scope to observe equivalent behaviours in several clinical serovars. This strongly supports the clinical relevance of the key behaviours that they document.</p>
<p>- The interdisciplinary nature of this study is a real strength and greatly increases the scope of the conclusions presented. Working from a structural understanding of chemoreceptor-ligand binding through to a larger-scale genetic analysis of chemoreceptor phylogeny allows the authors to draw important (although I find not always definitive) conclusions about bacterial migration towards human serum across a wide range of bacterial species (including many important pathogens). This is a very exciting approach and I was particularly interested to see the authors follow this up with observations of migration in C. koseri (a clinical isolate with little known about its chemotactic capabilities).</p>
<p>- The authors use experiments that compete migrating strains against each other and these offer an exciting glimpse into how bacterial movement and navigation could play out in multi-species environments like the human gut.</p>
<p>- The authors successfully identify a single component of human serum (i.e. serine) as one specific attractant driving the bacterial migration response seen here. Teasing apart the response of bacteria to complex stimuli like human serum is an important step here.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
There are several issues that I would personally like to see addressed in this study:</p>
<p>1. The authors refer to human serum as a chemoattractant numerous times throughout the study (including in the title). As the authors acknowledge, human serum is a complex mixture and different components of it may act as chemoattractants, chemo-repellents (particularly those with bactericidal activities), or may elicit other changes in motility (e.g. chemokinesis). The authors present convincing evidence that cells are attracted to serine within human serum - which is already a well-known bacterial chemoattractant. Indeed, their ability to elucidate specific elements of serum that influence bacterial motility is a real strength of the study. However, human serum itself is not a chemoattractant and this claim should be re-phrased - bacteria migrate towards human serum, driven at least in part by chemotaxis towards serine.</p>
<p>2. Linked to the previous point, several bacterial species (including E. coli - one of the bacterial species investigated here) are capable of osmotaxis (moving up or down gradients in osmolality). Whilst chemotaxis to serine is important here, could movement up the osmotic gradient generated by serum injection play a more general role? It could be interesting to measure the osmolality of the injected serum and test whether other solutions with similar osmolality elicit a similar migratory response. Another important control here would be to treat human serum with serine racemase and observe how this impacts bacterial migration.</p>
<p>3. The inference of the authors' genetic analysis combined with the migratory response of E. coli and C. koseri to human serum shown in Fig. 6 is that Tsr drives movement towards human serum across a range of Enterobacteriaceae species. The evidence for the importance of Tsr here is currently correlative - more causal evidence could be presented by either studying the response of tsr mutants in these two species (certainly these should be readily available for E. coli) or by studying the response of these two species to serine gradients.</p>
<p>4. The migratory response of E. coli looks striking when quantified (Fig. 6C), but is really unclear from looking at Panel B - it would be more convincing if an explanation was offered for why these images look so much less striking than analogous images for other species (E.g. Fig. 6A).</p>
<p>5. It is unclear why the fold-change in bacterial distribution shows an approximately Gaussian shape with a peak at a radial distance of between 50 -100 um from the source (see for example Fig. 2H). Initially, I thought that maybe this was due to the presence of the microcapillary needle at the source, but the CheY distribution looks completely flat (Fig. 3I). Is this an artifact of how the fold-change is being calculated? Certainly, it doesn't seem to support the authors' claim that cells increase in density to a point of saturation at the source. Furthermore, it also seems inappropriate to apply a linear fit to these non-linear distributions (as is done in Fig. 2H and in the many analogous figures throughout the manuscript).</p>
<p>6. The authors present several experiments where strains/ serovars competed against each other in these chemotaxis assays. As mentioned, these are a real strength of the study - however, their utility is not always clear. These experiments are useful for studying the effects of competition between bacteria with different abilities to climb gradients. However, to meaningfully interpret these effects, it is first necessary to understand how the different bacteria climb gradients in monoculture. As such, it would be instructive to provide monoculture data alongside these co-culture competition experiments.</p>
<p>7. Linked to the above point, it would be especially instructive to test a tsr mutant's response in monoculture. Comparing the bottom row of Fig. 3G to Fig. 3I suggests that when in co-culture with a cheY mutant, the tsr mutant shows a higher fold-change in radial distribution than the WT strain. Fig. 4G shows that a tsr mutant can chemotax towards aspartate at a similar, but reduced rate to WT. This could imply that (like the trg mutant), a tsr mutant has a more general motility defect (e.g. a speed defect), which could explain why it loses out when in competition with the WT in gradients of human serum, but actually seems to migrate strongly to human serum when in co-culture with a cheY mutant. This should be resolved by studying the response of a tsr mutant in monoculture.</p>
<p>8. In Fig. 4, the response of the three clinical serovars to serine gradients appears stronger than the lab serovar, whilst in Fig. 1, the response to human serum gradients shows the opposite trend with the lab serovar apparently showing the strongest response. Can the authors offer a possible explanation for these slightly confusing trends?</p>
<p>9. In Fig. S2, it seems important to present quantification of the effect of serine racemase and the reported lack of response to NE and DHMA - the single time-point images shown here are not easy to interpret.</p>
<p>10. Importantly, the authors detail how they controlled for the effects of pH and fluid flow (Line 133-136). Did the authors carry out similar controls for the dual-species experiments where fluorescent imaging could have significantly heated the fluid droplet driving stronger flow forces?</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
This manuscript characterizes a chemoattractant response to human serum by pathogenic bacteria, focusing on pathogenic strains of Salmonella enterica (Se). The researchers conducted the chemotaxis assays using a micropipette injection method that allows real-time tracking of bacterial population densities. They found that clinical isolates of several Se strains present a chemoattractant response to human serum. The specific chemoattractant within the serum is identified as L-serine, a highly characterized and ubiquitous chemoattractant, that is sensed by the Tsr receptor. They further show that chemoattraction to serum is impaired with a mutant strain devoid of Tsr. X-ray crystallography is then used to determine the structure of L-serine in the Se Tsr ligand binding domain, which differs slightly from a previously determined structure of a homologous domain. They went on to identify other pathogens that have a Tsr domain through a bioinformatics approach and show that these identified species also present a chemoattractant response to serum.</p>
<p>Strengths and Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
This study is well executed and the experiments are clearly presented. These novel chemotaxis assays provide advantages in terms of temporal resolution and the ability to detect responses from small concentrations. That said, it is perhaps not surprising these bacteria respond to serum as it is known to contain high levels of known chemoattractants, serine certainly, but also aspartate. In fact, the bacteria are shown to respond to aspartate and the tsr mutant is still chemotactic. The authors do not adequately support their decision to focus exclusively on the Tsr receptor. Tsr is one of the chemoreceptors responsible for observed attraction to serum, but perhaps, not the receptor. Furthermore, the verification of chemotaxis to serum is a useful finding, but the work does not establish the physiological relevance of the behavior or associate it with any type of disease progression. I would expect that a majority of chemotactic bacteria would be attracted to it under some conditions. Hence the impact of this finding on the chemotaxis or medical fields is uncertain.</p>
<p>The authors also state that &quot;Our inability to substantiate a structure-function relationship for NE/DHMA signaling indicates these neurotransmitters are not ligands of Tsr.&quot; Both norepinephrine (NE) and DHMA have been shown previously by other groups to be strong chemoattractants for E. coli (Ec), and this behavior was mediated by Tsr (e.g. single residue changes in the Tsr binding pocket block the response). Given the 82% sequence identity between the Se and Ec Tsr, this finding is unexpected (and potentially quite interesting). To validate this contradictory result the authors should test E. coli chemotaxis to DHMA in their assay. It may be possible that Ec responds to NE and DHMA and Se doesn't. However, currently, the data is not strong enough to rule out Tsr as a receptor to these ligands in all cases. At the very least the supporting data for Tsr being a receptor for NE/DHMA needs to be discussed.</p>
<p>The authors also determine a crystal structure of the Se Tsr periplasmic ligand binding domain bound to L-Ser and note that the orientation of the ligand is different than that modeled in a previously determined structure of lower resolution. I agree that the SeTsr ligand binding mode in the new structure is well-defined and unambiguous, but I think it is too strong to imply that the pose of the ligand in the previous structure is wrong. The two conformations are in fact quite similar to one another and the resolution of the older structure, is, in my view, insufficient to distinguish them. It is possible that there are real differences between the two structures. The domains do have different sequences and, moreover, the crystal forms and cryo-cooling conditions are different in each case. It's become increasingly apparent that temperature, as manifested in differential cooling conditions here, can affect ligand binding modes. It's also notable that full-length MCPs show negative cooperativity in binding ligands, which is typically lost in the isolated periplasmic domains. Hence ligand binding is sensitive to the environment of a given domain. In short, the current data is not convincing enough to say that a previous &quot;misconception&quot; is being corrected.</p>
