<abstract><p>Acetylation of lysine residues in the tail domain of histone H3 is well characterized, but lysine residues in the histone globular domain are also acetylated. Histone modifications in globular domain have regulatory potential because of their impact on nucleosome stability but remain poorly characterized. In this study we report the genome-wide distribution of acetylated H3 lysine 115 (H3K115ac), a residue on the lateral surface at the nucleosome dyad. In mouse embryonic stem cells, we find that H3K115ac is enriched at the transcription start site of active CpG island promoters, but also at polycomb repressed promoters prior to their subsequent activation during differentiation. By contrast, at enhancers H3K115ac is dynamic, changing in line with gene activation and chromatin accessibility during differentiation. Most strikingly, we show that H3K115ac is enriched on “fragile” nucleosomes within nucleosome depleted regions at promoters, and active enhancers where it coincides with transcription factor binding, and at CTCF bound sites. These unique features suggest that H3K115ac could contribute to nucleosome destabilization and that it might be a valuable marker for identifying functionally important regulatory elements in mammalian genomes.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Post-translational modifications (PTMs) of histone tails play key roles in chromatin structure and gene regulation. Modifications of the histone tails have attracted attention due to the unstructured nature of the domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Ghoneim et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Peng et al., 2021</xref>) and accessibility to chromatin modifiers and readers. However, more recently modifications in the globular domains of core histones have been associated with various chromatin functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Tropberger &amp; Schneider, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Pradeepa et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">Zorro Shahidian et al., 2021</xref>) but remain relatively understudied.</p>
<p>Modifications on the lateral surface of the histone octamer are of particular interest because these can directly affect interactions with DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Cosgrove et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Lawrence et al., 2016</xref>). For example, acetylation of lysine-56 on histone H3 (H3K56ac) is predicted to increase accessibility at both the entry and exit sites of the nucleosome, impacting gene expression, DNA replication and repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Rajagopalan et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Rodriguez et al., 2019</xref>). Lysine-64 on H3 is close to the nucleosome dyad axis and its acetylation (H3K64ac) decreases nucleosome stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Di Cerbo et al., 2014</xref>). Lysine-122 of H3 (H3K122) is also located close to the dyad axis and its acetylation impacts nucleosome stability and weakens histone-DNA interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Manohar et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Rajagopalan et al., 2017</xref>) with a direct consequence on transcription from a chromatinised template in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Tropberger et al., 2013</xref>). H3K122ac also makes nucleosomes more susceptible to disassembly by chromatin remodellers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Chatterjee et al., 2015</xref>). Other acylation events, such as succinylation of H3K122 also impact nucleosome stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">Zorro Shahidian et al., 2021</xref>). Whilst H3.3 is not essential in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs), mutation of H3.3 K122 to alanine is cell lethal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Patty et al., 2024</xref>).</p>
<p>H3K115 is in the globular domain of H3 at the nucleosome dyad. Because both H3K115 copies in the histone octamer are juxtaposed on the lateral surface of the nucleosome in close contact with the overlying DNA (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>), acetylation of H3K115 has a high potential to disrupt histone-DNA interactions and influence nucleosome dynamics, nucleosome breathing and histone release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">Zhou et al., 2019</xref>). Consistent with this, acetylation of H3K115 (H3K115ac) favours nucleosome disassembly and nucleosome sliding in vitro, by itself or together with H3K122ac (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Manohar et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Simon et al., 2011</xref>).</p>

<p>Promoters have a specific nucleosome organization: two well-positioned nucleosomes (+1 and -1) flank a nucleosome depleted region (NDR) immediately upstream of the transcription start site (TSS). This view has been revised with the detection of micrococcal nuclease- (MNase) and salt-sensitive nucleosome species within the NDRs after limited chromatin digestion with MNase. These have been termed fragile, unstable, or partially unwrapped nucleosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Henikoff et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Kent et al., 2011</xref>). Fragile nucleosomes can be isolated by MNase digestion under mild conditions and contain the H3.3 and H2AZ histone variants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Jin and Felsenfeld, 2007</xref>). In mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs), chemical cleavage methods have also identified sub-nucleosomes at TSSs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Ishi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Voong et al., 2016</xref>). To the best of our knowledge, fragile nucleosomes have not yet been associated with a specific histone modification in mammalian cells.</p>
<p>H3K64ac and H3K122ac have been identified at the TSS of active genes and at some active enhancers in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Tropberger et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Di Cerbo et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Pradeepa et al., 2016</xref>). In this study we report the distribution of H3K115ac across the mammalian genome in mESCs, and during the differentiation to neural progenitor cells (NPCs). This reveals the focal association of H3K115ac with fragile nucleosomes at both active and repressed CpG island (CGI) promoters, at active enhancers, and at other sites important for genome architecture. Our data suggest that H3K115ac has a genomic distribution distinct from other H3 acetylation marks, and that it could be an important new tool for the functional annotation and understanding of mammalian genomes.</p>

<title>H3K115ac is associated with active regions with a strong preference for CpG island promoters</title>
<p>To determine where H3K115 acetylated nucleosomes can be found across the mammalian genome we performed native chromatin immunoprecipitation and next generation sequencing (ChIP-seq) on mESCs. We used a commercially available antibody and confirmed its specificity for H3K115ac and not for unmodified H3K115, H3K115R, or H3K122ac on synthetic peptides (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1A</xref>) and for a variety of H3 and H4 lysine post-translational modifications on bar-coded nucleosomes (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1B</xref>).</p>
<p>H3K115ac ChIP data were highly reproducible between biological replicates (Pearson’s &gt; 0.9, Supplementary table 1). Genome-wide analysis showed that H3K115ac peaks correlate with regions decorated with histone H3 post-translational modifications (PTMs) associated with active gene regulation, both on the H3 tail (H3K27ac, H3K4me1) and at the lateral surface of the nucleosome (H3K64ac and H3K122ac) as well as with regions of chromatin accessibility as assayed by ATAC-seq (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). Using a chromHMM segmentation approach, we observed that H3K115ac regions have a greater degree of overlap with active promoters and enhancers, compared to H3K122ac and H3K27ac (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). Notably, there are fewer called peaks for H3K115ac (∼39000), compared to other H3 lysine acetylation marks in mESC (H3K122ac ∼80,000; H3K64ac ∼65,000; H3K27ac &gt;100,000).</p>
<p>Approximately one third of H3K115ac peaks are associated with transcription start sites (TSS) with H3K115ac levels generally correlating with levels of transcription as assayed by 4SU-seq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Benabdallah et al., 2019</xref>) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>). However, while examining key pluripotency genes, we noticed that H3K115ac is enriched, along with H3K64ac and H3K122ac, at the TSS of <italic>Sox2</italic> and <italic>Klf4</italic>, but not that of <italic>Nanog</italic> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>). The <italic>Sox2</italic> and <italic>Klf4</italic> promoters are located within CpG islands (CGIs), but the promoter of <italic>Nanog</italic> lacks a CGI, prompting us to investigate H3K115ac with respect to CGIs. Genome wide, ∼60% of CGI associated TSSs (CGI promoters) are marked with H3K115ac in mESCs compared to just 2% for non-CGI promoters. CGI promoters exhibit H3K115ac levels many folds higher than non-CGI promoters with comparable levels of transcription (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>). This same discrimination between CGI and non-CGI promoters is not so pronounced for H3K122ac and H3K27ac.</p>
<p>H3K115ac does not scale linearly with gene expression when comparing levels of H3K115ac and transcription at promoters in general. This discrepancy is resolved when we consider CGI and non-CGI promoters separately. Non-CGI promoters have lower overall expression levels compared to CGI promoters but H3K115ac scales with quartiles of expression for this promoter class (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G</xref>). CGI promoters on the other hand, exhibit significant levels of H3K115ac even for the lowest quartile of expression. These results suggest a special link between CGI promoters and H3K115ac.</p>

<title>H3K115ac marks CpG island promoters poised for activation</title>
<p>To determine the relationship between H3K115ac and dynamic gene expression, we differentiated 46c mESC cells to neural progenitor cells (NPCs) monitoring differentiation by Sox1-GFP fluorescence. ChIP-seq for H3K115ac and ATAC-seq were carried out after 7 days of differentiation and nascent RNA quantified (4SU-seq) on days 0, 3, 5 and 7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Benabdallah et al., 2019</xref>).</p>
<p>TSSs were classified into those that gained or lost H3K115ac during differentiation if the TSS (−500 to +500 bp) showed at least a 2-fold change in H3K115ac signal compared with day 0. On average, transcription increased from TSS that also gained H3K115ac but to a modest extent, compared with the more substantial loss of H3K115ac from downregulated TSS (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>).</p>

<p>Given the strong bias of H3K115ac toward CGI promoters largely independent of transcription (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>), we classified CGI- and non-CGI promoters based on changes in H3K115ac (gain/loss) and expression (up/down) during differentiation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). Promoters exhibit positive enrichment for congruent changes of H3K115ac and transcription (gain ∼ up and loss ∼ down) and negative enrichment for incongruent changes (gain ∼ down and loss ∼ up) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>, supplementary table 2). However, these enrichments are stronger for non-CGI promoters than for CGI promoters. This is consistent with our observation that some CGI promoters are marked with H3K115ac while being transcribed at extremely low levels (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G</xref>).</p>
<p>In line with this, we identified a set of promoters that are transcriptionally upregulated in NPC but without any significant changes in their H3K115ac levels (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>). In mESC, these promoters exhibit very low transcription along with high levels of H3K27me3, which are then lost upon differentiation (Goronzy et. al., 2022). Compared to these promoters, a background set of promoters with no changes in H3K115ac and no change in transcription (&gt; 2 fold) during differentiation have very low levels of H3K27me3 (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2A</xref>). H3K115ac-marked promoter sets - including those showing no change in H3K115ac despite transcriptional activation during differentiation - are enriched for high-confidence bivalent genes taken from another study (Seneviratne et. al., 2024, supplementary table 2). This indicates that H3K115ac is a feature of CGI associated genes that are polycomb targets in mESCs and that are poised for later activation in NPCs (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2B</xref>). Examples of this include <italic>Efna5</italic>, <italic>Slca23</italic> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>) and <italic>Insm1</italic> (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2C</xref>), all genes known to have a function in neuronal cells.</p>
<p>H3K115ac shows a stronger enrichment at CGI, polycomb repressed and bivalent promoters in mESC than two other globular domain H3 modifications - H3K64ac and H3K122ac (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2D</xref>). H3K27ac, as expected, is depleted from CGI promoters, since H3K27ac and H3K27me3 are mutually exclusive. In contrast to H3K115ac, H3K64ac and H3K122ac are enriched over the gene body and upstream regions, but not at the TSS, of CGI-associated genes (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2E</xref>).</p>

<title>H3K115ac marks fragile nucleosomes within promoter NDRs</title>
<p>We noted that, H3K115ac signal over promoters appears much more focal and centred over the TSS compared with both H3K27ac and H3K122ac that are depleted over the TSS (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>). This suggests that H3K115ac may be associated with MNase-sensitive nucleosomes in the promoter NDR. These nucleosomes can be detected as sub-nucleosomes (footprint &lt; 147bp) obtained from small fragments sequenced from partial MNase digestion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Carone et al., 2014</xref>) or mono-nucleosomes (footprint ∼ 147 bp) obtained under low salt conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Jin &amp; Felsenfeld, 2007</xref>). Both species of nucleosome particles are referred to as fragile nucleosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Carone et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Ishi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Voong et al., 2016</xref>).</p>
<p>To investigate the distribution of H3K115ac in relation to nucleosome size, we repeated the H3K115ac and H3K27ac ChIP on partially MNase-digested native chromatin from mESCs and sequenced both ends of the purified DNA fragments. Around the most active promoters (4SU Q4), signal from small (&lt;150 bp) MNase digested fragments accumulate inside the TSS NDR (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figure S3A</xref>). Signal from fragments &gt; 150 bp exhibits the characteristic nucleosome depletion, with the NDR becoming more pronounced with increasing fragment lengths. We used this rationale to split ChIP fragments into sub-nucleosomes (≤150 bp) and mono-nucleosomes (151 – 230 bp) (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figure S3B</xref>). Paired-end ChIP-seq confirmed the presence of H3K115ac within the NDR of active promoters on sub-nucleosomes and mono-nucleosomes immediately upstream of the TSS (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figure S3C</xref>). In contrast, H3K27ac is enriched in the gene body and upstream of the TSS but is depleted over the NDR.</p>
<p>H3K115ac ChIP preferentially selects nucleosomes that are shorter than the average input nucleosomes. This is not the case for nucleosomes selected by H3K27ac ChIP (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figure S3D</xref>, Supplementary table 3). This is an indication that H3K115ac may be associated with destabilized and partially unwrapped fragile nucleosomes. Because nucleosomes associated with A/T-rich sequences are known to be more sensitive to MNase compared to sites of higher G/C content (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Chereji et al., 2019</xref>), we analysed A/T content in H3K115ac and H3K27ac libraries. Sequences associated with H3K115ac sub- and mono-nucleosomes have significantly higher A/T content than those marked with H3K27ac (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figure S3E</xref>, p &lt; 0.01, Wilcox Test, supplementary table 3). This bias does not originate from differences in MNase digestion levels, because the matched input libraries do not show such a difference. This suggests a stronger association of H3K115ac with nucleosome fragility compared to of H3K27ac. Difference in A/T content also suggests that H3K115ac and H3K27ac fragments come from distinct populations of nucleosomes. H3K115ac modified sub-nucleosomes and mono-nucleosomes have the same A/T content, indicating that H3K115ac nucleosomes are present in different stages of unwrapping or stability (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figure S3E</xref>).</p>
<p>To explore H3K115ac ChIP fragment size from mESCs in relation to promoter NDRs and flanking nucleosomes, we plotted the distance between the fragment centre and the nearest TSS as 2D contour V-plots of highest density regions for a conservative TSSs set (see Methods). Signal from input libraries show the promoter NDR flanked by positioned nucleosomes with smaller nucleosome particles of varying sizes inside the NDR (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). H3K27ac signal is most abundant on the +1 nucleosome with barely detectable signal inside the NDR. In contrast, H3K115ac is most enriched on the -1 nucleosome and on subnucleosome-sized fragments inside the NDR (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>, bottom panel). We then defined NDRs by taking the distance between the TSS and the -1 nucleosome positioning data from published datasets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">West et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Voong et al., 2016</xref>), scaled them to the same length, and plotted the coverage of stable nucleosomes (MNase-seq), H3K27ac and H3K115ac fragments at these sites (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). H3K27ac is generally depleted from the NDR, but both H3K115ac modified mono- and subnucleosomes are enriched within the NDR. Within the NDR, subnucleosomes-sized H3K115ac MNase fragments are TSS proximal whereas mononucleosomal fragments are displaced toward the -1 nucleosome (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>).</p>

<p>To further investigate the properties of subnucleosomal and mononucleosomal particles, we separated MNase digested mESCs chromatin by sucrose gradient sedimentation which can separate fragile and stable nucleosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Nocente et al., 2024</xref>) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>). Sequencing of the chromatin fractions showed the expected depletion of mononucleosomes at the TSS NDR, whereas the slower sedimenting fragile nucleosomes are enriched over the NDR (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>). H3K115ac ChIP-seq from chromatin fractions showed that H3K115ac is enriched in fragile nucleosomal and even slower sedimenting (lower mass) subnucleosomal fractions at TSS, but not in fractions with stable mononucleosomes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>).</p>

<p>Sequences capable of enhancer activity on episomes in mESCs have been identified by STARR-seq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Peng et al., 2020</xref>) but only half of these correspond to accessible endogenous chromatin sites, as determined by ATAC-seq. Compared with H3K27ac and various acetyl-lysines on histone H2B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Narita et al., 2023</xref>), H3K115ac better discriminates those STARR-seq hits mapping to accessible (ATAC+) sites in the mESC genome from those that are ATAC- (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figure S4A</xref>), even though the proportions of total H3K115ac and H2B acetylated lysines peaks in the mESC genome that are ATAC+ are similar (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figure S4B</xref>). Association of H3K115ac with active enhancers is further substantiated by the enrichment of transcription factors, co-activators and RNA polymerase II at non TSS H3K115ac regions as revealed by a random forest approach using published datasets (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figure S4C</xref>).</p>
<p>During mESC to NPC differentiation, the most frequent changes in H3K115ac occur at enhancers (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figure S4D</xref>). Loss of H3K115ac from ESC-specific enhancers correlates to loss of chromatin accessibility (ATAC-seq), enhancers gaining H3K115ac during differentiation to NPCs also gained chromatin accessibility (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>).</p>
<p>Like promoters, active enhancers are known to be depleted of stable nucleosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Oruba et al., 2020</xref>). Pioneer TFs, which can bind their recognition sequences buried in nucleosomes, can lead to nucleosome destabilisation and priming the site for the binding of additional TFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Vernimmen and Bickmore, 2015</xref>). We analysed H3K115ac and H3K27ac paired-end ChIP-seq data at mESCs enhancers occupied by the pioneer pluripotency TF Oct4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">King and Klose, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">MacCarthy et al., 2022</xref>). As expected, chromatin accessibility, as assayed by ATAC-seq, scales with Oct4 occupancy, with a sharp dip in accessibility centred at the Oct4 motif likely due to the protection offered by Oct4 binding (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figure S4E</xref>). H3K27ac levels correlate with Oct4 occupancy in regions immediately flanking the Oct4 binding site but are depleted over the binding site itself (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figure S4F</xref>). H3K115ac profiles also correlate with Oct4 occupancy, but both mononucleosomal and subnucleosomal H3K115ac marked fragments are enriched over the Oct4 motif itself (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figure S4F</xref>).</p>
<p>As Oct4 binds co-operatively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Sinha et al., 2023</xref>), we also analysed enhancers with two Oct4 motifs scaling the distance between the two motifs to a window of the same width. The presence of two Oct4 motifs in proximity creates sharp protected footprints in ATAC-seq data, with high chromatin accessibility between the two sites (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>, top panel). The absence of stable nucleosomes between the two motifs is evident in MNase-seq data, with strongly positioned nucleosomes flanking the ATAC-accessible region. H3K27ac is enriched on these flanking nucleosomes but is depleted between the Oct4 motifs (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>, bottom panel). In contrast, H3K115ac enrichment on both mono- and sub-nucleosome-sized fragments spans the entire region between the two Oct4 motifs (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>, middle panel).</p>
<p>Active enhancers and promoters are known to harbour fragile nucleosomes carrying the histone variant H3.3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Jin and Felsenfeld, 2007</xref>), with the -1 nucleosome reported to be hyperdynamic because of high H3.3 turnover (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Schlesinger et al., 2017</xref>). Consistent with H3K115ac enrichment on the -1 nucleosome (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>), H3K115ac-marked distal elements correlate with sites of high H3.3 turnover (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Deaton et al., 2016</xref>) (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figure S4G</xref>). To investigate if H3K115ac then merely correlates with fragile nucleosomes because it is deposited solely on H3.3, we generated a histone H3.3 knock-out mESC line. Immunoblotting shows that global levels of H3K115ac are not affected by H3.3 deletion indicating that H3K115ac is not specific to H3.3 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>). These data show that H3K115ac and its association with fragile nucleosomes, is linked to binding of pioneer TF complexes and chromatin accessibility at active enhancers elements and CGI promoters in an H3.3-independent manner.</p>

<title>H3K115ac marks fragile nucleosomes at CTCF binding sites</title>
<p>Though CTCF binding was originally thought to exclude nucleosomes, fragile nucleosomes and subnucleosomal fragments have been detected at CTCF binding sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Voong et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Klein et al., 2023</xref>).

<p>Using contoured V-plots, we detected small (∼50-150 bp) and 250bp MNase resistant fragments within the CTCF NDR, flanked by strongly positioned nucleosome-sized fragments (compare Q4 to Q1 in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>, left panels). In agreement with average occupancy plots (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>), H5K115ac is detected on the -1 and +1 positioned nucleosomes and these nucleosomes exhibit a wider range of fragment sizes (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>, middle). This suggests that these nucleosomes are more dynamic than the stable nucleosomes visible in MNase-seq (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). Within the CTCF NDR, H3K115ac ChIP fragments produce a V-shape pattern of which is more prominent at high CTCF occupancy sites (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>, middle). In the centre of the V, 100-175 bp sized fragments most likely contain H3K115ac marked subnucleosomes in complex with CTCF. The horns of this V-shaped pattern indicate H3K115ac-marked flanking mononucleosomes interacting with CTCF and/or other factors leading to MNase protected 225-350 bp fragments. In contrast, H3K27ac is depleted from the NDR, and its enrichment is largely limited to mononucleosomes immediately flanking the CTCF site (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>, right).</p>
<p>V-plots also reveal a subtle asymmetry in the distribution H3K115ac fragments within the CTCF NDR, with occupancy of subnucleosomal H3K115ac fragments slightly higher toward the 3’ end of the CTCF motif. While upstream nucleosomes (MNase-seq) maintain phasing, with decreasing CTCF occupancy the +1 nucleosome becomes fuzzier and begins to encroach into the CTCF NDR at low CTCF occupancy (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Figure S5B</xref>). This directional bias is lost when the orientation of CTCF motifs is randomised. To ascertain that the directional bias is not due to higher CTCF occupancy merely coinciding with TAD boundaries, we used proximity to the nearest TAD boundary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Bonev et al, 2017</xref>) as the probability with which a given CTCF site participates in TAD boundary formation, and divided CTCF motifs into quartiles of this distance (TAD score; Supplementary table 4). We plotted occupancy of stable nucleosomes around the motifs in these quartiles and sorted each quartile by descending order of CTCF occupancy (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Figure S5C</xref>). The fuzziness of nucleosomes downstream of CTCF sites is inversely correlated with CTCF occupancy across all TAD scores quartiles.</p>

<p>Lysine acetylation in the globular domain of histones, and particularly at the lateral surface of the nucleosome where histones are in close contact with overlying DNA, is not well studied but is important for nucleosome dynamics, nucleosome stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Di Cerbo et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Chatterjee et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Lawrence et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Rajagopalan et al., 2017</xref>) and transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Tropberger et al., 2013</xref>). In this study we explored acetylation of H3K115, a residue located at the nucleosome dyad which weakens histone DNA interactions and destabilizes nucleosome in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Chatterjee et al., 2015</xref>). In <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> H3K115A and H3K115Q abrogate transcriptional silencing and result in hypersensitivity to DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Hyland et al., 2005</xref>).

<p>We found that in mESCs, and their differentiated derivatives, H3K115ac exhibits a strong preference for active and epigenetically repressed CGI promoters. This is consistent with the known correlation between CGIs and nucleosome depletion independent of transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Tazi and Bird, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Fenouil et al., 2012</xref>), their enrichment in the variant histone H2A.Z, and the presence of specific CGI binding proteins that open chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">Yukawa et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Grand et al., 2021</xref>). As well as active CGI promoters, H3K115ac is associated with polycomb repressed promoters in mESCs. Though polycomb complexes can be found at “bivalent” chromatin domains, characterized by the simultaneous presence of both repressive (H3K27me3) and active (H3K4me3) histone marks at the same promoter regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Voigt et al., 2013</xref>), to our knowledge, H3K115ac is the first histone acetylation found within the NDRs associated with polycomb repressed promoters.</p>
<p>Histone acetylation, particularly in the histone H3 tail, has been used as a marker to identify active enhancers. H3K27ac is most widely used for this purpose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Moore et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Stunnenberg et al., 2016</xref>) and various acetyl-lysines in the N-terminal of histone H2B (H2B-NTac) enhance the discovery of active enhancers when used in combination with H3K27ac (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Peng et al., 2020</xref>). However, H3K27ac is dispensable for gene activation in mESCs during the exit from pluripotency and for enhancer chromatin accessibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Sankar et al., 2022</xref>) and it performs poorly as a predictor of functional variants in enhancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Biddie et al., 2024</xref>). We previously showed that acetylation of H3K64 and H3K122 in the H3 core marks a subset of active enhancers in mESCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Pradeepa et al., 2016</xref>). Whereas H3K115ac marks both active and repressed CpG island promoters, we find that H3K115ac is dynamically associated with active enhancers and is enriched within the nucleosome-depleted binding sites of key transcription factors. Its tight associated with chromatin accessibility suggests that H3K115ac could enhance detection of active enhancers when used in combination with other PTMs.</p>
<p>A distinct feature of H3K115ac is its association with fragile nucleosome. We show that H3K115ac is enriched in the NDRs associated with promoters, enhancers and CTCF sites. DNA associated with H3K115ac nucleosomes has higher A/T content than that associated with H3K27ac consistent with the enhanced MNase sensitivity of nucleosomes associated with A/T-rich sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Chereji et al., 2019</xref>). We confirm the association of H3K115ac with fragile nucleosomes by ChIP-seq of chromatin fractionated on sucrose gradients. In contrast, H3K27ac, H3K64ac and H3K122ac are depleted from fragile nucleosomes and NDRs. Interestingly, H3K122 and H3K115ac exhibit distinct profiles despite their proximity within the structure of the nucleosome core suggesting specific and distinct mechanisms of deposition of these marks.</p>
<p>CTCF sites show an H3K115ac pattern distinct from promoters and enhancers as mononucleosomal H3K115ac signal is limited to +1 and -1 positioned nucleosomes flanking CTCF sites while the CTCF NDR is occupied by subnucleosomes marked with H3K115ac most likely in complex with CTCF protein. We note that weakly bound CTCF sites show a weaker nucleosome positioning but only in 3’ of the CTCF NDR and independent of TAD boundaries. Interestingly, CTCF N-terminus which interacts with cohesin, impeding or reversing cohesin-mediated loop extrusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Li et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Nora et al., 2020</xref>), aligns with 3’- end of the CTCF motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Yang et al., 2023</xref>). Mechanisms of CTCF binding, orientation, H3K115ac and nucleosome remodeling may be interlinked.</p>
<p>Though nucleosome fragility has been associated with H3.3 and H2AZ histone variants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Jin et al., 2009</xref>), we show that H3K115ac is not restricted to H3.3. Our findings support the possibility that acetylation of H3K115 at the dyad axis of the nucleosome enhances the unwrapping or breathing of DNA from the core particle, or the release of histone subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Chatterjee et al., 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">Zhou et al., 2019</xref>). The cBAF chromatin remodelling complex has recently been shown to act on fragile nucleosomes at mESCs enhancers to generate hemisomes that facilitate further Oct4 binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Nocente et al., 2024</xref>). Given the impact of H3K115 acetylation on nucleosome stability in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Manohar et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Simon et al., 2011</xref>) and nucleosome disassembly by chromatin remodelers (Chatterjee at al., 2015), it is plausible that H3K115 acetylation facilitates the action of cBAF in further destabilising fragile nucleosomes at enhancers contributing to a dynamic chromatin state. Consistent with our observation of H3K115ac enrichment at repressed CGI promoters in mESCs, polycomb repressed promoters have also been shown to contain fragile nucleosomes attributed to BAF remodelling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Brahma &amp; Henikoff. 2024</xref>). To the best of our knowledge, H3K115ac is the first histone modification enriched on a fragile nucleosome at the TSS of CGIs, at polycomb repressed promoters, at the TF binding sites of active enhancers, and at CTCF sites.</p>
<p>H3K115ac is therefore focussed at the heart of regulatory activity in the mammalian genome. In the future, it will be interesting to establish the functional significance of H3K115ac in modulating nucleosome structure, gene regulation and genome organization and to ascertain the value of H3K115ac profiling for the functional annotation of genomes.</p>

For a given TSS (coding and non-coding), 1000 bp upstream and downstream were added and used as a promoter region to filter out promoter proximal peaks in downstream analyses. To create a reference set of unique protein-coding TSSs without duplicated entries, we collapsed the transcripts with identical TSS location. For use in V-plots, a more conservative set of TSSs was defined such that: i) for genes with multiple TSSs, a single TSS with highest 4SU-seq count in mESCs was retained, ii) genes with single TSSs were included, iii) TSSs were filtered out if there was another coding/non-coding TSS within 1 Kbp. This ensured that the local and directional observations in our analyses are not affected by transcriptional activity in the vicinity. Association of promoters with CGIs was defined based on a CGI located within 500bp upstream or downstream of the TSS.</p>

<title>CTCF ChIP-seq peaks and motif calls</title>
<p>Analysis of nucleosome positioning around CTCF sites using CTCF ChIP-seq peaks as reference point suffers from low resolution. To mitigate this, we intersected CTCF peaks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Mas et al., 2018</xref>) in the mESC genome with CTCF motif calls and selected peaks with a single CTCF motif. We used these motif coordinates as reference point to plot histone acetylation data. Replicate merged CTCF ChIP-seq peaks for mESCs were downloaded from Remap2022 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Mas et al.,2018</xref>; Hammal et. al., 2022; GSE99530). ChIP-seq peak scores were used to split data into quartiles in R. The mouse genome was scanned for concensus CTCF motifs (JASPER: MA0139.1) using <italic>matchPWM</italic> in the Biostrings package in Bioconductor. We removed any peaks that overlapped with &gt; one CTCF motif and CTCF binding scores divided into quartiles.</p>

<title>Contour plots</title>
<p>For TSS and CTCF motifs we plotted signed distance (x-axis) and fragment length (y-axis). We defined equal number of high-density regions as contours using the package ggdensity in ggplot2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Otto and Kahle, 2023</xref>). Contours refer to different levels of fragment density as shown by color density. Each contour is associated with a probability (%) with which it is bound to data.</p>

<p>The reviewers have found that this manuscript is a <bold>valuable</bold> contribution, and the evidence in support of its conclusions is mostly <bold>solid</bold>. It provides novel insights and raises interesting possibilities about the functions of an understudied histone modification within the nucleosome core; however, the data are mostly descriptive and correlative, and although this has value, it is not totally persuasive. Short of additional non-genomic experiments, a more detailed analysis of the genomic data and perhaps additional data would strengthen the conclusions. The manuscript crucially needs further antibody validation to raise confidence in the data.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors investigate the role of H3K115ac in mouse embryonic stem cells. They report that H3K115ac localizes to regions enriched for fragile nucleosomes, CpG islands, and enhancers, and that it correlates with transcriptional activity. These findings suggest a potential role for this globular domain modification in nucleosome dynamics and gene regulation. If robust, these observations would expand our understanding of how non-tail histone modifications contribute to chromatin accessibility and transcriptional control.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) The study addresses a histone PTM in the globular domain, which is relatively unexplored compared to tail modifications.</p>
<p>(2) The implication of a histone PTM in fragile nucleosome localization is novel and, if substantiated, could represent a significant advance for the field.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) The absence of replicate paired-end datasets limits confidence in peak localization.</p>
<p>(2) The analyses are primarily correlative, making it difficult to fully assess robustness or to support strong mechanistic conclusions.</p>
<p>(3) Some claims (e.g., specificity for CpG islands, &quot;dynamic&quot; regulation during differentiation) are not fully supported by the analyses as presented.</p>
<p>(4) Overall, the study introduces an intriguing new angle on globular PTMs, but additional rigor and mechanistic evidence are needed to substantiate the conclusions.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Kumar et al. aimed to assess the role of the understudied H3K115 acetylation mark, which is located in the nucleosomal core. To this end, the authors performed ChIP-seq experiments of H3K115ac in mouse embryonic stem cells as well as during differentiation into neuronal progenitor cells. Subsequent bioinformatic analyses revealed an association of H3K115ac with fragile nucleosomes at CpG island promoters, as well as with enhancers and CTCF binding sites. This is an interesting study, which provides important novel insights into the potential function of H3K115ac. However, the study is mainly descriptive, and functional experiments are missing.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) The authors present the first genome-wide profiling of H3K115ac and link this poorly characterized modification to fragile nucleosomes, CpG island promoters, enhancers, and CTCF binding sites.</p>
<p>(2) The study provides a valuable descriptive resource and raises intriguing hypotheses about the role of H3K115ac in chromatin regulation.</p>
<p>(3) The breadth of the bioinformatic analyses adds to the value of the dataset</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) I am not fully convinced about the specificity of the antibody. Although the experiment in Figure S1A shows a specific binding to H3K115ac-modified peptides compared to unmodified peptides, the authors do not show any experiment that shows that the antibody does not bind to unrelated proteins. Thus, a Western of a nuclear extract or the chromatin fraction would be critical to show. Also, peptide competition using the H3K115ac peptide to block the antibody may be good to further support the specificity of the antibody. Also, I don't understand the experiment in Figure S1B. What does it tell us when the H3K115ac histone mark itself is missing? The KLF4 promoter does not appear to be a suitable positive control, given that hundreds of proteins/histone modifications are likely present at this region.</p>
<p>It is important to clearly demonstrate that the antibody exclusively recognizes H3K115ac, given that the conclusion of the manuscript strongly depends on the reliability of the obtained ChIP-Seq data.</p>
<p>(2) The association of H3K115ac with fragile nucleosomes based on MNase-Sensitivity and fragment length, which are indirect methods and can have technical bias. Experiments that support that the H3K115ac modified nucleosomes are indeed more fragile are missing.</p>
<p>(3) The comparison of H3K115ac with H3K122ac and H3K64ac relies on publicly available datasets. Since the authors argue that these marks are distinct, data generated under identical experimental conditions would be more convincing. At a minimum, the limitations of using external datasets should be discussed.</p>
<p>(4) The enrichment of H3K115ac at enhancers and CTCF binding sites is notable but remains descriptive. It would be interesting to clarify whether H3K115ac actively influences transcription factor/CTCF binding or is a downstream correlate.</p>
<p>(5) No information is provided about how H3K115ac may be deposited/removed. Without this information, it is difficult to place this modification into established chromatin regulatory pathways.</p>
<p>At the very least, the authors should acknowledge these limitations and provide additional validation of antibody specificity.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Kumar et al. examine the H3K115 epigenetic mark located on the lateral surface of the histone core domain and present evidence that it may serve as a marker enriched at transcription start sites (TSSs) of active CpG island promoters and at polycomb-repressed promoters. They also note enrichment of the H3K115ac mark is found on fragile nucleosomes within nucleosome-depleted regions, on active enhancers, and CTCF-bound sites. They propose that these observations suggest that H3K115ac contributes to nucleosome destabilization and so may serve as a marker of functionally important regulatory elements in mammalian genomes.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors present novel observations suggesting that acetylation of a histone residue in a core (versus on a histone tail) domain may serve a functional role in promoting transcription, in CPG islands and polycomb-repressed promoters. They present a solid amount of confirmatory in silico data using appropriate methodology that supports the idea that the H3K115ac mark may function to destabilize nucleosomes and contribute to regulating ESC differentiation.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Additional experiments to confirm antibody specificity are needed. The authors use synthetic peptides for other markers (e.g., H3K122) to support the claim that the antibody is specific, but ChIP-ChIP assays are performed under cross-linked, non-denatured conditions, which preserve structure and epitope accessibility differently than synthetic peptides used for dot blots. Does the antibody give a single band in western blots of histones, and can the H3K115ac peptide block western and immunofluorescence signals of the antibody? Given that the antibody is a rabbit polyclonal, specificity is not a trivial consideration.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer 1:</bold></p>
<p>Comment 1. The reviewer was under the impression that that we did not perform biological replicates of our ChIP-seq experiments. All ChIP-seq (and ATAC-seq) experiments were performed with biological replicates and the Pearson’s correlations (all &gt;0.9) between replicates were provided in Supplementary Table 1. We had indicated this in the text and methods but will try to make this even clearer.</p>
<p><bold>Reviewer 2:</bold></p>
<p>Comment 2. The reviewer states that our claim of H3K115ac being associated with fragile nucleosomes is based solely on MNase sensitivity and fragment length. This is not correct. Figure 3C and D show the results of sucrose gradient sedimentation experiments, followed by ChIP-seq clearly showing that H3K115ac fractionates with chromatin particles that are enriched for fragile nucleosomes and subnucleosomes. By contrast, H3K115ac is not enriched in stable mononucleosome</p>
<p>Comment 3. The reviewer states that our H3K122ac and H3K64ac comparison rely on publicly available datasets. We would emphasize that these are our own datasets generated and published previously (Pradeepa et. al., 2016) but using exactly the same native MNase ChIP protocol as used here for H3K115ac and processed with identical computational pipelines.</p>
<p><bold>Reviewer 3:</bold></p>
<p>Reviewer 3 is mistaken in thinking our ChIP experiments are performed under cross-linked conditions. As clearly stated in the main text and methods, all our ChIP-seq for histone modifications is done on native MNase-digested chromatin – with no cross-linking. This includes the spike-in experiment shown in Fig S1B to test H3K115ac antibody specificity against the bar-coded SNAP-ChIP® K-AcylStat Panel from Epicypher. We could not include H3K115ac bar-coded nucleosomes in that experiment since they are not available in the panel.</p>
<p>Following that, we would propose to make minor revisions in response to specific reviewer recommendations before posting a version of record. These would include:</p>
<p>(1) Figure 2: title needs change: &quot;H3K115ac marks CpG island promoters poised for activation&quot;. this is to make sure it reads with the title for the corresponding section in the main text. Also see: Reviewer 1 comment 7 in Recommendations part.</p>
<p>(2) Figure S2B: legend should read: &quot;Gene ontology analysis for the set of genes analysed in Figure 2C&quot;</p>
<p>(3) Figure F4D: Provide the replicates for western blot</p>
<p>(4) Figure 4A,B: Corrected formatting issues.</p>
