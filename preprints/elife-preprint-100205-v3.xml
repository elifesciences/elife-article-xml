<title>Abstract</title>
<p>The induction of adipose thermogenesis plays a critical role in maintaining body temperature and improving metabolic homeostasis to combat obesity. β3-adrenoceptor (β3-AR) is widely recognized as a canonical β-adrenergic G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that plays a crucial role in mediating adipose thermogenesis in mice. Nonetheless, the limited expression of β3-AR in human adipocytes restricts its clinical application. The objective of this study was to identify a GPCR that is highly expressed in human adipocytes and to explore its potential involvement in adipose thermogenesis. Our research findings have demonstrated that the adhesion G protein-coupled receptor A3 (ADGRA3), an orphan GPCR, plays a significant role in adipose thermogenesis through its constitutively active effects. ADGRA3 exhibited high expression levels in human adipocytes and mouse brown fat. Furthermore, the knockdown of <italic>Adgra3</italic> resulted in an exacerbated obese phenotype and a reduction in the expression of thermogenic markers. Conversely, <italic>Adgra3</italic> overexpression activated the adipose thermogenic program and improved metabolic homeostasis without an exogenous ligand supplementation. We found that ADGRA3 facilitates the biogenesis of beige adipocytes through the Gs-PKA-CREB axis. Moreover, hesperetin was identified as a potential agonist of ADGRA3, capable of inducing adipocyte browning and ameliorating insulin resistance. In conclusion, our study demonstrated that the overexpression of constitutively active ADGRA3 or the activation of ADGRA3 by hesperetin can induce adipocyte browning by Gs-PKA-CREB axis. These findings indicate that the utilization of hesperetin and the selectively overexpression of ADGRA3 in adipose tissue could serve as promising therapeutic strategies in the fight against obesity.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Since 1975, there has been a substantial increase in the global prevalence of obesity, with the magnitude nearly tripling. The World Health Organization projects that the prevalence of obesity among adults will exceed 20% by the year 2025 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>). Currently, the management of excessive adiposity poses a paramount economic burden and healthcare predicament (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>). In addition to the detrimental social and psychological implications, a multitude of studies have consistently demonstrated a significant association between obesity and an increased vulnerability to a range of health conditions, such as type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>).</p>
<p>Activating and maintaining the thermogenesis of beige/brown fat has been shown to be effective in treating obesity and related metabolic disorders in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>). As a well-established β-adrenergic GPCR, the β3-AR has been identified as a prominent target for stimulating adipose thermogenesis in mice. Regrettably, the clinical application of β3-AR has been impeded due to its low expression in human adipocytes and the cardiovascular risks associated with other adrenergic receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>). G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are the most prevalent class of drug targets among all drugs approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). They also play a crucial role in the clinical treatment of obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>). Therefore, it is of clinical significance to identify novel GPCR targets that induce adipose thermogenesis.</p>
<p>ADGRA3 is classified as an orphan adhesion G protein-coupled receptor (aGPCR) and exhibits the typical domains found in aGPCRs within its N-terminal extracellular region (ECR), including a leucine-rich repeat (LRR), an immunoglobulin-like domain (Ig), a hormone-binding domain (HBD), and a GAIN domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>). ADGRA3 was initially discovered as a distinctive indicator of various spermatogonial progenitor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>). Recent studies have shown that the orphan status of receptors has posed challenges to the study of aGPCRs. However, these studies have also uncovered a conservative mechanism of aGPCR activation, which involves the use of tethered ligands in the GAIN domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>). ADGRA3 has been previously identified as a receptor capable of auto-cleavage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>). However, the functional activity of ADGRA3 in a constructive manner is still uncertain. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) demonstrated a significant correlation between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of ADGRA3 and body weight in chickens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>).</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the precise role of ADGRA3 in the progression of obesity and adipose thermogenesis remains uncertain. This study aimed to investigate three main aspects: (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>) the impact of ADGRA3 on browning of white adipose tissue (WAT) and brown adipose tissue (BAT), (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>) the effects of ADGRA3 on metabolic homeostasis, and (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>) the underlying mechanisms by which ADGRA3 induces adipose thermogenesis.</p>

<title>ADGRA3 is identified as a potential GPCR inducing the development of beige fat</title>
<p>We conducted a comprehensive analysis of three datasets to identify ADGRA3 as a potential GPCR target that promotes the development of beige fat (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). To identify novel GPCRs that induce the biogenesis of beige fat, we conducted differential gene expression analysis (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>) and Venn diagram analysis (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>) using the GSE118849 dataset obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. Additionally, we utilized the human subcutaneous adipocytes dataset (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>, red) and human visceral adipocytes dataset (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>, purple) from the human protein atlas database to obtain genes that are highly expressed in human white adipocytes. The GSE118849 dataset comprises samples of brown adipose tissue (BAT) and inguinal white adipose tissue (iWAT) obtained from mice subjected to a 72-hour cold exposure at a temperature of 4℃.</p>

<p>A total of 1134 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) that exhibited up-regulation in BAT compared to iWAT under cold stimulation were identified in the analysis, which might play a role in adipose thermogenesis. These DEGs were further screened to identify highly expressed GPCRs in BAT relative to WAT (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>, red). We conducted additional annotation on 1134 DEGs and identified that 27 of these genes were associated with the encoding of GPCRs (Supplementary File 2). Among the set of 27 genes, it was found that 24 genes were not present in the group of genes that exhibited high expression levels in human adipocytes, as determined by the human protein atlas database. Consequently, these 24 genes were excluded from further analysis. We conducted a comprehensive literature review and discovered that out of the three remaining GPCRs namely ADGRA3, ADRA1A, and ADRB1, only ADGRA3 has not been documented to have any association with brown fat. Therefore, our research subsequently shifted towards investigating the potential regulatory role of ADGRA3 in obesity and brown fat.</p>
<p>The findings indicated that the level of <italic>Adgra3</italic> expression in mouse adipose tissue (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>) was comparatively lower than that of <italic>Adrb3</italic>, the coding gene for β3-AR. Conversely, in human adipose tissue, <italic>ADGRA3</italic> expression was observed to be higher than that of <italic>ADRB3</italic> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1E</xref> and <xref rid="figs1-1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1-figure supplement 1E</xref>). We conducted an investigation to examine the regulatory effects of a high-fat diet on the transcription of <italic>Adgra3</italic> and <italic>Ucp1</italic> (Uncoupling protein 1, a functional protein and marker of beige/brown fat). The findings of the study demonstrated that a HFD had a significant inhibitory effect on the expression of ADGRA3 and UCP1 in iWAT and BAT, while CL robustly increased the expression of ADGRA3 and UCP1 in iWAT and BAT (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1F-G</xref> and <xref rid="figs1-1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1-figure supplement 1A-D</xref>). Interestingly, in human subcutaneous fat, there was a moderate positive correlation between the expression level of <italic>ADGRA3</italic> and the expression level of <italic>UCP1</italic> (<italic>R</italic>=0.5, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1H</xref>). On the other hand, the expression level of <italic>ADRB3</italic> showed a weak positive correlation with the expression level of <italic>UCP1</italic> (<italic>R</italic>=0.21, <xref rid="figs1-1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1-figure supplement 1F</xref>). The data presented in this study indicate that ADGRA3 is a GPCR that exhibits high expression levels in BAT and may participate in inducing adipose thermogenesis.</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<title>Adgra3 overexpression induces the biogenesis of beige adipocytes in vitro</title>
<p>To ascertain the predominant expression of ADGRA3, the isolation of stromal Vascular Fraction (SVF) and mature adipocytes from WAT and BAT was conducted for subsequent validation. The results showed that ADGRA3 is predominantly expressed in adipocytes. Furthermore, the expression level of ADGRA3 in BAT adipocytes was found to be higher compared to WAT adipocytes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1I</xref>). However, no significant difference was observed in the expression level of ADGRA3 in the SVF of WAT and BAT (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1I</xref>). Moreover, it was observed that the modulation of the expression levels of <italic>Adgra3/ADGRA3</italic> and <italic>Ucp1/UCP1</italic> exhibited a similar pattern during the differentiation process between mouse and human adipocytes (<xref rid="figs1-1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1-figure supplement 1G-H</xref>).</p>
<p>To investigate the role of ADGRA3 in the biogenesis of beige adipocytes, we conducted an experiment where we transformed pre-adipocytes 3T3-L1 into mature beige-like adipocytes with a knockdown of <italic>Adgra3</italic>. Our findings indicate that the knockdown of <italic>Adgra3</italic> resulted in a decrease in the expression of genes related to thermogenesis and lipolysis (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). Western blot analysis and Mito-Tracker staining revealed a decrease in the expression of UCP1 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>) and a reduction in the number of mitochondria (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>) following <italic>Adgra3</italic> knockdown. Lipid droplet fluorescence staining and intracellular triglyceride assay were performed on adipocytes to assess the impact of <italic>Adgra3</italic> knockdown. The results revealed a significant increase in the number of lipid droplets and intracellular triglyceride levels (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2C-D</xref>) following <italic>Adgra3</italic> knockdown. Moreover, the uptake of 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-NBDG), a fluorescently-labeled deoxyglucose analog, by adipocytes was significantly inhibited following the knockdown of <italic>Adgra3</italic> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>). Furthermore, oxygen consumption rate (OCR) was detected to verify the effect of ADGRA3 on the oxygen consumption of adipocytes. The results indicated that the loss of ADGRA3 decreased the both basal and max OCR of adipocytes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2F-G</xref>).</p>

<p>Remarkably, the knockdown of <italic>Adgra3</italic> resulted in a significant reduction in both body temperature (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>) and BAT temperature (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>). Given the crucial influence of thyroid activity on thermogenesis, we measured the levels of serum free tetraiodothyronine (fT4) to evaluate the consequences of <italic>Adgra3</italic> knockdown on thyroid activity, which indicated that the nanoparticle-mediated <italic>Adgra3</italic> knockdown does not exert an inhibitory effect on thyroid activity (<xref rid="figs3-1" ref-type="fig">Figure 3-figure supplement 1H</xref>). The knockdown of <italic>Adgra3</italic> resulted in a significant decrease in the expression of genes related to thermogenesis and lipolysis in both iWAT (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref>) and BAT (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3G</xref>). Moreover, the Western blot analysis (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3H-I</xref>) and Immunohistochemical staining (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3J</xref>) of UCP1 revealed comparable outcomes. Additionally, it was observed that the knockdown of <italic>Adgra3</italic> resulted in an increase in the size of lipid droplets and a decrease in the number of mitochondria in BAT (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3K</xref>). Furthermore, nanomaterials carrying sh<italic>Adgra3</italic> were directly injected into BAT (<xref rid="figs3-1" ref-type="fig">Figure 3-figure supplement 1I</xref>), resulting in knockdown of <italic>Adgra3</italic> and down-regulation of thermogenic and lipolysis-related genes, as compared to BAT injected with shNC (<xref rid="figs3-1" ref-type="fig">Figure 3-figure supplement 1J</xref>). These findings indicate that ADGRA3 plays a crucial role as a receptor in the biogenesis of beige fat and the activation of BAT.</p>
<p>Moreover, the genes that were highly expressed in ADGRA3 high-expressed human subcutaneous adipose tissue (<xref rid="figs3-2" ref-type="fig">Figure 3-figure supplement 2A</xref>, red) exhibited enrichment in various biological processes. These processes included hyperinsulinism, obesity (<xref rid="figs3-2" ref-type="fig">Figure 3-figure supplement 2B</xref>), metabolic processes (<xref rid="figs3-2" ref-type="fig">Figure 3-figure supplement 2C</xref>), adipogenesis (<xref rid="figs3-2" ref-type="fig">Figure 3-figure supplement 2D</xref>), regulation of lipolysis in adipocytes (<xref rid="figs3-2" ref-type="fig">Figure 3-figure supplement 2E</xref>), and lipid metabolism (<xref rid="figs3-2" ref-type="fig">Figure 3-figure supplement 2F</xref>). GSEA was conducted to search the enriched KEGG pathways based on the expression level of ADGRA3 in human subcutaneous adipose dataset and human visceral adipose dataset from GTEx portal database. For ADGRA3 high-expressed group, both subcutaneous adipose dataset (<xref rid="figs3-2" ref-type="fig">Figure 3-figure supplement 2G</xref>) and visceral adipose dataset (<xref rid="figs3-2" ref-type="fig">Figure 3-figure supplement 2H</xref>) enriched in insulin signaling pathway, which indicates that ADGRA3 may be involved in the regulation of glucose metabolism in addition to its influence on lipid metabolism. Furthermore, it was observed that sh<italic>Adgra3</italic> mice exhibited significant disruptions in overall glycemic homeostasis (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3L</xref>) and insulin sensitivity (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3M</xref>). Moreover, the fasting serum insulin level was increased and the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) showed an increase in sh<italic>Adgra3</italic> mice (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3N-O</xref>). Hence, the findings of this study provide evidence that the knockdown of <italic>Adgra3</italic> hampers adipose thermogenesis and disrupts metabolic homeostasis in vivo.</p>

<title>ADGRA3 activates the adipose thermogenic program via the G<sub>s</sub>-PKA-CREB axis</title>
<p>To ascertain the ADGRA3-conjugated Gα protein, we conducted an overexpression of FLAG-labeled mouse ADGRA3 and four different types of His-labeled G<sub>α</sub> proteins (G<sub>s</sub>, G<sub>i</sub>, G<sub>q</sub> and G<sub>12</sub>) in 293T cells. The lysate obtained from the 293T cells was then utilized for the subsequent co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) analysis. The results of the co-IP experiment demonstrated that mouse ADGRA3 coupled to the G<sub>s</sub> protein (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5A-B</xref>), while no interaction was observed with the other three Gα proteins (G<sub>i</sub>, G<sub>q</sub> and G<sub>12</sub>; <xref rid="figs5-1" ref-type="fig">Figure 5-figure supplement 1A-C</xref>) ADGRA3 exhibits intrinsic and auto-cleavable receptor activity, allowing it to signal even in the absence of an exogenous ligand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>). Hence, the overexpression of <italic>Adgra3</italic> is capable of inducing cAMP production (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>), which serves as a second messenger indicating the activation of downstream signals mediated by G<sub>s</sub> protein. This response is comparable to the effect of a ligand. However, there is no production of IP1, which is a metabolite of the downstream second messenger IP3 associated with G<sub>q</sub> protein (<xref rid="figs5-1" ref-type="fig">Figure 5-figure supplement 1D</xref>).

<p>Hence, it was hypothesized that the overexpression of <italic>Adgra3</italic> could potentially stimulate adipocyte thermogenesis by activating the PKA signaling pathway. As expected, the Western-blot analysis revealed that the overexpression of <italic>Adgra3</italic> leads to an elevation in the phosphorylated form of CREB (p-CREB), indicating an increase in PKA-CREB signaling activity. This effect was observed in 3T3-L1 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref>), as well as in the iWAT and BAT (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5F</xref>). Consistently, the knockdown of <italic>Adgra3</italic> resulted in a decrease in the level of p-CREB in 3T3-L1 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5G</xref>), as well as in iWAT and BAT (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5H</xref>). To investigate the potential role of <italic>Adgra3</italic> overexpression in promoting the biogenesis of beige adipocytes and activating the PKA-CREB signaling pathway via G<sub>s</sub> protein, we conducted an experiment using 3T3-L1 cells. The cells were treated with <italic>Adgra3</italic> OE and sh<italic>Gnas</italic>, respectively. <italic>Adgra3</italic> overexpression was found to be adequate in inducing the expression of UCP1 in 3T3-L1 cells.

Furthermore, the utilization of PKAi (protein kinase A inhibitor, H-89) was employed to ascertain the dependence of the browning effect of Adgra3 overexpression on the PKA-CREB signal. The results showed that PKAi effectively inhibited the activation of PKA-CREB signaling and UCP1 expression induced by <italic>Adgra3</italic> overexpression (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5J</xref> and <xref rid="figs5-1" ref-type="fig">Figure 5-figure supplement 1F</xref>).

<p>Concurrently, hesperetin induced a decline in TG level in both serum (<xref rid="figs7-1" ref-type="fig">Figure 7-figure supplement 1C</xref>) and liver (<xref rid="figs7-1" ref-type="fig">Figure 7-figure supplement 1D</xref>), and also reduced the area of adipocytes in iWAT (<xref rid="figs7-1" ref-type="fig">Figure 7-figure supplement 1E</xref>) and BAT (<xref rid="figs7-1" ref-type="fig">Figure 7-figure supplement 1F</xref>). However, these effects were absent in sh<italic>Adgra3</italic> mice. Moreover, the expression level of UCP1 were elevated in both iWAT (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figures 7F</xref> and <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7H</xref>) and BAT (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figures 7G</xref> and <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7I</xref>) after hesperetin treatment in shNC mice but not in sh<italic>Adgra3</italic> mice.

These findings suggest that hesperetin is sufficient to orchestrate the hallmarks of thermogenesis in mice, which is dependent on ADGRA3.</p>
<p>We then investigated the metabolic impact of hesperetin treatment.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In the present study, we have elucidated a novel role of ADGRA3 and hesperetin in inducing the development of beige adipocytes through the activation of the G<sub>s</sub>-PKA-CREB signaling pathway. ADGRA3 is responsible for the activation of the adipose thermogenic program and plays a significant role in maintaining systemic glucose homeostasis. Additionally, the development of beige adipocytes induced by hesperetin is contingent upon the presence of ADGRA3. The novelty of this study is the discovery that ADGRA3 plays a role in the advancement of beige fat and the regulation of metabolic homeostasis. This suggests that targeting the ADGRA3-G<sub>s</sub>-PKA-CREB signaling pathway could potentially be a therapeutic approach for obesity and related metabolic disorders.</p>
<p>The induction of beige fat has been investigated as a potentially effective therapeutic approach in combating obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>). A clinical trial revealed that treatment with the chronic β3-AR agonist mirabegron leads to an increase in human brown fat, HDL cholesterol, and insulin sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>). Subsequently, Blondin et al discovered that oral administration of mirabegron only elicits an increase in BAT thermogenesis when administered at the maximal allowable dose, indicating that human brown adipocyte thermogenesis is primarily driven by β2-adrenoceptor (β2-AR) stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>). Consistent with this finding, we found much higher levels of ADRB2 expression in human white adipose tissue than ADRB3 (<xref rid="figs1-1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1-figure supplement 1E</xref>). Furthermore, a recent study has demonstrated that simultaneous activation of β2-AR and β3-AR enhances whole-body metabolism through beneficial effects on skeletal muscle and BAT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>).</p>
<p>While the promotion of thermogenesis in brown and beige adipocytes in rodents was effectively achieved by the β3-adrenoceptor agonist, the clinical implications of this finding appear to be unfeasible in humans due to the low efficacy of β3-adrenoceptor agonists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>). It is of utmost importance to investigate alternative therapeutic targets that can effectively and selectively enhance beige adipogenesis in order to combat obesity and its related metabolic disorders. In this study, we have identified ADGRA3 as a novel GPCR therapeutic target that exhibits high expression in human adipocytes. In human adipose tissue, ADGRA3 is expressed at a lower level than ADRB2 (<xref rid="figs1-1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1-figure supplement 1 E</xref>), which has been shown to be the main receptor mediating adrenergic activation of thermogenesis in human brown adipocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>). Nevertheless, given ADRB2’s pivotal role in bronchodilation and vasodilation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>), we believe that ADGRA3 has the potential to be an alternative target for inducing adipose thermogenesis. Overall, these findings suggest that ADGRA3, when overexpressed or stimulated by its potential agonist, hesperetin, can induce the biogenesis of beige fat.</p>
<p>Hesperetin has been reported to attenuate the age-related metabolic decline, reduce fat and improve glucose homeostasis in naturally aged mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>). Previous studies showed that hesperetin improved glycemic control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>) and was involved in adipocyte differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>), but whether hesperetin induces the biogenesis of beige adipocyte was uncertain. Previously, the influence of hesperetin on ADGRA3 has remained unreported. In this study, we screened hesperetin as a potential agonist for ADGRA3 by using the PRESTO-Salsa tool as well as discovered that hesperetin has an agonist effect on ADGRA3 through a series of experiments. This study focuses on the regulatory effect of hesperetin on adipose thermogenesis and explores whether this effect is dependent upon ADGRA3. As such, we refrained from conducting further investigations into other potential effects of hesperidin, including its potential role in antioxidant and in apoptosis.</p>
<p>In previous reports, male mice deficient in ADGRA3 showed obstructive azoospermia with high penetrance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>). Moreover, a genome-wide association study (GWAS) identified a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) located in the downstream region of <italic>ADGRA3</italic> as a genomic locus associated with body weight in chickens, suggesting that the ADGRA3 is a potential regulator of body weight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>). Nevertheless, the agonist and the downstream signal axis of ADGRA3 remain unclear as well as the effects of ADGRA3 on adipose thermogenesis and glucose homeostasis have not been explored. Consequently, our study has confirmed that the knockdown of <italic>Adgra3</italic> exacerbates obesity and disrupts glucose homeostasis. Additionally, both the overexpression of <italic>Adgra3</italic> and the administration of hesperetin have been found to stimulate the biogenesis of beige adipocytes through the ADGRA3-G<sub>s</sub>-PKA-CREB signaling pathway and improve glucose homeostasis.</p>
<p>Given the consideration that the non-targeted nanoparticle approach utilized in this study for modulating <italic>Adgra3</italic> expression levels in vivo alter <italic>Adgra3</italic> expression in tissues beyond adipose tissue (<xref rid="figs3-1" ref-type="fig">Figure 3-figure supplement 1A-B</xref> and <xref rid="figs4-1" ref-type="fig">Figure 4-figure supplement 1B-C</xref>), notably the liver and skeletal muscle, the construction of <italic>Adgra3</italic> adipose tissue-specific knockout/overexpression mouse models is imperative for a more nuanced understanding of the precise mechanisms underlying the influence of on adipose thermogenesis. Furthermore, it is crucial to highlight that the observed decrease in TG levels in both serum and liver (<xref rid="figs4-2" ref-type="fig">Figure 4-figure supplement 2C-D</xref>) might be attributed to the significant increase in <italic>Adgra3</italic> expression in the liver, which is a consequence of the nanoparticle-mediated overexpression of <italic>Adgra3</italic>. While the exact mechanism remains to be fully elucidated, this correlation suggests a potential link between <italic>Adgra3</italic> overexpression in the liver and reduced TG levels in the serum. We will employ more sophisticated models in subsequent studies to further elucidate the effects of ADGRA3 on adipose thermogenesis and metabolic homeostasis. Nevertheless, our findings underlie a potential therapeutic feature of ADGRA3 and hesperetin in obesity and the associated metabolic diseases from the thermogenic viewpoint of beige fat.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the activation of the G<sub>s</sub>-PKA-CREB axis by ADGRA3 has been found to induce adipose thermogenesis, promote lipid metabolism, and alleviate lipid accumulation in adipose tissues (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9</xref>). Furthermore, the induction of beige adipocyte biogenesis by hesperetin occurs through the ADGRA3-G<sub>s</sub>-PKA-CREB axis. Given the importance of identifying signaling pathways that induce beige fat and alleviate obesity-related dysfunction in adipose tissue, our research findings suggest that hesperetin and activation of the intracellular signaling of ADGRA3 could serve as a promising and innovative therapeutic approach.</p>

At the designated time points of 0 minutes, intraperitoneal glucose or insulin tolerance tests were conducted on mice that had been fasted for six hours. After administration, the blood glucose concentration was assessed at specific time intervals using a OneTouch Ultra Glucometer. Finally, the animals were euthanized, followed by the collection of tissue samples. Cohorts of ≥3 mice per genotype or treatment were assembled for all in vivo studies. All in vivo studies were repeated 2-3 independent times. All procedures related to animal feeding, treatment and welfare were conducted at Sun Yat-sen University Laboratory Animal Center. All the animal experiments were conducted with the approval of the Animal Care and Use Committee of Sun Yat-sen University (Approval ID: SYSU-IACUC-MED-2023-B082).

<title>Differential expression analysis</title>
<p>The R package Linear Models for Microarray Data (limma) was used to analyze differential RNA-Sequencing expression. For screening high-expressed G-protein-coupled receptors in mouse BAT, limma was applied in the GSE118849 dataset to screen out BAT-elevated genes. For screening ADGRA3 high-expressed gene sets in human subcutaneous adipose, limma was applied in the human subcutaneous adipose dataset from GTEx Portal to screen out ADGRA3 high-expressed gene sets. Genes highly expressed in human adipocytes were obtained from the human protein atlas database. Genes with the cutoff criteria of |logFC| ≥ 1.0 and P &lt; 0.05 were regarded as differentially expressed genes (DEGs). The DEGs of the GSE118849 dataset and the human subcutaneous adipose dataset were visualized as volcano plots by using the R package ggplot2.</p>

<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>All data are presented as mean ± <italic>SEM</italic>. In this study, outliers that met the three-sigma rule were excluded from analysis, with the exception of those presented in <xref rid="figs1-1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1-figure supplement 1E</xref>. Given the possibility that the outliers in <xref rid="figs1-1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1-figure supplement 1E</xref> represent extreme expressions of the inherent variability within the population sample, we have chosen to retain these specific outliers for further analysis. Student’s t-test was used to compare two groups. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) or Two-way ANOVA was applied to compare more than two different groups on GraphPad Prism 9.0 software. For each parameter of all data presented, NS (No Significance), *<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05, ** <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01, *** <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001 and **** <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001. <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05 is considered significant.</p>

<p>The study highlights adhesion G-protein-coupled receptor A3 (ADGRA3) as a potential target for activating adaptive thermogenesis in both white and brown adipose tissue. This finding offers <bold>valuable</bold> insights for researchers in the field of adipose tissue biology and metabolism. The authors have presented additional evidence to address the reviewers' comments, including experiments conducted on primary stromal vascular fractions from adipose tissues. However, the revised manuscript fails to address several reviewer concerns, such as the measurement of whole-body energy expenditure through indirect calorimetry and the assessment of food intake. Furthermore, the nanoparticle-mediated knockdown of Adgra3 did not adequately address the tissue selectivity of ADGRA in mice. As a result, the primary claims of the study are only partially supported by the available data, leading to the conclusion that the research is deemed <bold>incomplete</bold>.</p>

<p>Based on bioinformatics and expression analysis using mouse and human samples, the authors claim that the adhesion G-protein coupled receptor ADGRA3 may be a valuable target for increasing thermogenic activity and metabolic health. Genetic approaches to deplete ADGRA3 expression in vitro resulted in reduced expression of thermogenic genes including Ucp1, reduced basal respiration and metabolic activity as reflected by reduced glucose uptake and triglyceride accumulation. In line, nanoparticle delivery of shAdgra3 constructs is associated with increased body weight, reduced thermogenic gene expression in white and brown adipose tissue (WAT, BAT), and impaired glucose and insulin tolerance. On the other hand, ADGRA3 overexpression is associated with an improved metabolic profile in vitro and in vivo, which can be explained by increasing the activity of the well-established Gs-PKA-CREB axis. Notably, a computational screen suggested that ADGRA3 is activated by hesperetin. This metabolite is a derivative of the major citrus flavonoid hesperidin and has been described to promote metabolic health. Using appropriate in vitro and in vivo studies, the authors show that hesperitin supplementation is associated with increased thermogenesis, UCP1 levels in WAT and BAT, and improved glucose tolerance, an effect that was attenuated in the absence of ADGRA3 expression.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the previous reviews.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Public Reviews:</bold></p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This article identifies ADGR3 as a candidate GPCR for mediating beige fat development. The authors use human expression data from Human Protein Atlas and Gtex databases and combine this with experiments performed in mice and a murine cell line. They refer to a GPCR bioactivity screening tool PRESTO-Salsa, with which it was found that Hesperetin activates ADGR3. From their experiments, authors conclude that Hesperetin activates ADGR3, inducing a Gs-PKA-CREB axis resulting in adipose thermogenesis.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors analyze human data from public databases and perform functional studies in mouse models. They identify a new GPCR with a role in thermogenic activation of adipocytes.</p>
<p>Considerations:</p>
<p>Selection of ADGRA3 as a candidate GPCR relevant for mediating beiging in humans:</p>
<p>The authors identify GPCRs that are expressed more highly in murine iBAT compared to iWAT in response to cold and assess which of these GPCRs are expressed in human subcutaneous or visceral adipocytes. Although this strategy will identify GPCRs that are expressed at higher levels in brown fat compared to beige and thus possibly more active in thermogenic function, the relevance in choosing GPCRs that also are expressed in unstimulated human white adipocytes should be considered. Thermogenic activity is not normally present in human white adipocytes. It would have strengthened the GPCR selection if the authors instead had assessed the intersection with human brown adipocytes that were activated with norepinephrine.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate your constructive feedback and believe that by adopting this refined strategy, we will strengthen our selection of GPCRs related to adipose thermogenesis in other ongoing studies. We look forward to continuing our research in this area and contributing to the understanding of adipose thermogenesis and its potential therapeutic applications. Thank you once again for your valuable input.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Strategy to investigate the role of ADGRA3 in WAT beiging:</p>
<p>Having identified ADGRA3 as their candidate receptor, the authors investigated the receptor in mouse models, the murine inguinal adipocyte cell line 3T3 and in human subcutaneous adipose progenitors (HAdsc) differentiated in vitro. Calling the human cells &quot;beige&quot; is a stretch as these cells are derived from a white adipose depot. The authors do observe regulation in UCP1 and abundance of mitochondria following modification of ADGRA3 in the cells. However, in future studies, it should be considered if the receptor rather plays a role in differentiation per se, and perhaps not specifically in thermogenic differentiation/activity.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Regarding the reviewer's suggestion to consider whether ADGRA3 plays a role in differentiation per se, rather than specifically in thermogenic differentiation/activity, we acknowledge that this is an important consideration. Our current studies have focused on the role of ADGRA3 in regulating UCP1 expression and mitochondrial abundance, which are hallmarks of adipose thermogenic activity. However, we recognize that ADGRA3 may also have broader roles in adipocyte differentiation and function that are not limited to thermogenesis.</p>
<p>To address this point, in future studies, we plan to conduct additional experiments to investigate the potential role of ADGRA3 in adipocyte differentiation, including its effects on the expression of markers of adipocyte differentiation and its impact on adipocyte metabolism and function. These studies will provide further insights into the mechanisms by which ADGRA3 regulates adipocyte biology.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>According to the Human Protein Atlas and Gtex databases, ADGRA3 is not only expressed in adipocytes, but also in other tissues and cell types. The authors address this by measuring the expression in a panel of these tissues, demonstrating a knockdown not only in the adipose tissue, but also in the liver and less pronounced in the muscle (Figure S2). It should thus be emphasized that the decreased TG levels in serum and liver in the mice might in fact depend on Adgra3 overexpression in the liver. Even though this might not have been the purpose of the experiment, it is important to highlight this as it could serve as hypothesis building for future studies of the function of this receptor.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your thoughtful comments and feedback. We appreciate the insight provided by the Human Protein Atlas and Gtex databases regarding the tissue distribution of ADGRA3. We fully acknowledge that the decreased TG levels observed in both the serum and liver of the mice might be linked to the overexpression of <italic>Adgra3</italic> in the liver.</p>
<p>Although this was not the primary objective of our experiment, we agree that this observation is worth highlighting as it could serve as a basis for future hypothesis-driven research on the functional role of ADGRA3 in different tissues. In light of your comments, we emphasized this potential link between <italic>Adgra3</italic> overexpression in the liver and reduced TG levels in discussion, as follows.</p>
<p>“…the precise mechanisms underlying the influence of on adipose thermogenesis. Furthermore, it is crucial to highlight that the observed decrease in TG levels in both serum and liver (Figure 4-figure supplement 2C-D) might be attributed to the significant increase in <italic>Adgra3</italic> expression in the liver, which is a consequence of the nanoparticle-mediated overexpression of <italic>Adgra3</italic>. While the exact mechanism remains to be fully elucidated, this correlation suggests a potential link between <italic>Adgra3</italic> overexpression in the liver and reduced TG levels in the serum. We will employ more sophisticated models in subsequent studies to further…”</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The manuscript by Zhao et al. explored the function of adhesion G protein-coupled receptor A3 (ADGRA3) in thermogenic fat biology.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Through both in vivo and in vitro studies, the authors found that the gain function of ADGRA3 leads to browning of white fat and ameliorates insulin resistance.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>There are several lines of weak methodologies such as using 3T3-L1 adipocytes and intraperitoneal(i.p.) injection of virus. Moreover, as the authors stated that ADGRA3 is constitutively active, how could the authors then identify a chemical ligand?</p>
<p>Comments on revised version:</p>
<p>The revised manuscript by Zhao et al. has limited improvement. The authors refused to perform revised experiments using primary cultures even though two reviewers pointed out the same weakness (3T3-L1 adipocytes are unsuitable). Using infrared thermography to measure body temperature is also problematic.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks for your comments. We regret that human adipocytes induced from human adipose-derived stem cells (hADSCs) were not recognized as primary cultures by multiple reviewers. Therefore, we have included relevant experimental results of mouse primary adipocytes induced from stromal vascular fraction (SVF) in Figure 8E-H as a supplement. The thermal imaging device was used to measure the temperature of BAT, while the body temperature was measured at 9:00 using a rectal probe connected to a digital thermometer.</p>
