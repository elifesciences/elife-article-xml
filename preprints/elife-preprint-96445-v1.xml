<title>Abstract</title><p>Gastric cancer (GC) is a major cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide. Despite the widespread recognition of tumor immunotherapy in treating unresectable GC, challenges, including ineffective immunotherapy and drug resistance, persist. Therefore, understanding the regulatory mechanisms of PD-L1, particularly in the context of super-enhancers (SEs) and zinc finger protein 36 ring finger protein-like 1 (ZFP36L1) RNA-binding protein, is crucial.</p>
</abstract>
<abstract>
<title>Methods</title>
<p>In this study, we performed H3K27ac CUT&amp;Tag sequencing, investigated the heterogeneity of SEs between two GC subtypes with differential growth patterns, and revealed the immune escape signatures driven by ZFP36L1-SE in infiltrative GC through SEs inhibitors treatment. The regulation of ZFP36L1 to PD-L1 was evaluated by quantitative PCR, western blot, flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry. Furthermore, we explored its regulatory mechanisms using a combination of molecular biology techniques, including luciferase reporter assay, GST/RNA pull-down, ChIP/RIP experiments, and in vivo functional assays.</p>
</abstract>
<abstract>
<title>Results</title>
<p>We demonstrated that ZFP36L1, driven by an SE, enhances IFN-γ-induced PD-L1 expression, with SPI1 identified as the specific transcription factor binding to ZFP36L1-SE. Mechanistically, ZFP36L1 binds to the adenylate uridylate-rich element in the 3ʹUTR of <italic>HDAC3</italic> mRNA, exacerbating its mRNA decay, and thereby facilitating PD-L1 abnormal transcriptional activation.</p>
</abstract>
<abstract>
<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Collectively, our findings provide mechanistic insights into the role of the SPI1– ZFP36L1–HDAC3–PD-L1 signaling axis in orchestrating immune escape mechanisms in GC, thereby offering valuable insights into the potential targets for immune checkpoint therapy in GC management.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Gastric cancer (GC) remains the third leading cause of cancer-related mortality in China, thereby posing significant socio-economic challenges [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>]. The Ming classification, which categorizes GC into infiltrative and expanding subtypes based on distinct growth patterns, is pivotal in understanding the biological heterogeneity of this disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>]. Tumor immunotherapy, particularly targeting programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 (PD-L1; CD274), is a promising approach for unresectable GC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>]. Notably, PD-L1, expressed on tumor cell surfaces, interacts with PD-1 receptors on cytotoxic T cells, leading to T-cell apoptosis and facilitating cancer immune evasion. Clinical studies, such as KEYNOTE-811, have demonstrated the efficacy of PD-L1 inhibitors, including pembrolizumab, especially in HER2-positive gastric adenocarcinoma study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>]. Therefore, current guidelines recommend the use of checkpoint inhibitor therapy in GC cases with high PD-L1 combined positive scores. Despite these advancements, elucidating the regulatory mechanisms of PD-L1 is imperative owing to challenges associated with ineffective immunotherapy and drug resistance.</p>
<p>Super-enhancers (SEs), initially proposed by Richard A. Young, are densely clustered transcriptionally active enhancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>]. SEs exhibit distinct characteristics, including heightened enrichment of histone H3 acetylation at lysine 27 (H3K27ac), recruitment of numerous transcription factors (TFs) such as bromodomain-containing protein 4 (BRD4), MED1, and P300, and robust stimulation of target genes. Utilizing the Rank Ordering of Super-Enhancers (ROSE) algorithm, researchers can identify and explore cancer-associated SEs through techniques such as ChIP-seq and Cleavage Under Targets and Tagmentation (CUT&amp;Tag) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>]. In the epigenetic landscape of tumors, acquired SEs are implicated in promoting transcriptional dysregulation, contributing to oncogenesis, invasion, metabolic alterations, drug resistance and the establishment of an immunosuppressive microenvironment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>]. Previous studies have elucidated the unique SE landscape in mesenchymal-type GC and highlighted the role of EMT-related kinase NUAK1 at both transcriptional and epigenetic levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>]. However, further investigations are warranted to elucidate the effects of SEs during GC metastasis and immune evasion.</p>
<p>The Zinc-finger protein 36 (ZFP36) gene family encodes three RNA-binding proteins: ZFP36, ZFP36L1, and ZFP36L2, characterized by two CCCH-type tandem zinc finger domains. These proteins recognize adenylate uridylate-rich elements (AREs) in the 3ʹ untranslated region (UTR) of target mRNAs, leading to mRNA deadenylation and degradation, ultimately diminishing protein synthesis. ZFP36 targets multiple inflammatory factors thereby playing a crucial role as an anti-inflammatory factor closely associated with inflammatory diseases such as psoriasis and arthritis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>]. <italic>ZFP36L2</italic> has been identified as an SE-activated gene with proto-oncogenic functions in GC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>]. <italic>ZFP36L1</italic>, also known as <italic>TIS11B</italic>/<italic>BRF1</italic>, is primarily located in the q24.1 region of human chromosome 14, with a length of 8599 bases long. The gene exhibits three annotated transcripts, with NM_004926.4 being the predominant transcript. The encoded protein comprises 338 amino acids and contains two tandem zinc finger structural domains, a nuclear localization signal, and a nuclear export signal region. It is distributed across the nucleus, cytoplasm, and subcellular structural apparatus. Despite ongoing debates regarding its role, ZFP36L1 remains a subject of interest in tumor biology.</p>
<p>We previously identified differential protein expression patterns in expanding and infiltrative GC, notably observing increased levels of MED1 and P300 in infiltrative GC <bold>(Supplementary Figure 1A)</bold> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>]. Based on these findings, we postulated that infiltrative GC may exhibit heightened enhancer activity and dysregulated transcription. To validate this hypothesis, we aimed to compare the distribution of SEs between Ming-expanding and infiltrative GC. ZFP36L1-SE was then identified as the key SE in infiltrative GC. Additionally, we aimed to elucidate the significance of SE-driven ZFP36L1 in tumor immune evasion and the SPI1–ZFP36L1–HDAC3–PD-L1 signaling axis. Collectively, we believe that our findings would contribute to a deeper understanding of immune checkpoint therapies for GC.</p>

<title>SE heterogeneity between two subtypes of gastric cancer with differential growth patterns</title>
<p>Six GC samples were collected, and H3K27ac CUT&amp;Tag sequencing was performed for the first time to identify of GC SEs (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). The two GC growth patterns did not significantly differ in terms of typical enhancers <bold>(Supplementary Figure 1B)</bold>. However, a bimodal H3K27ac enrichment was observed in infiltrative GC compared with that in expanding GC (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). A total of 1057 and 819 infiltrative and expanding SE peaks, respectively, were obtained using the ROSE algorithm. Over 50% of these peaks were located in the non-coding regions such as exons and introns, and their predicted target genes were transcribed to produce non-coding RNAs; the peaks distributed in transcription start and termination sites activated the promoters and directly drove the transcription of protein-coding genes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). Collectively, these data targeted 240 infiltrative and 173 expanding SE-driven genes <bold>(</bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref><bold>, Supplementary Figure 1C)</bold>.</p>

<p>Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analyses displayed that negative regulation of T cell proliferation, response to tumor necrosis factor (TNF), regulation of epithelial cell migration and 3ʹUTR-mediated mRNA destabilization pathway signatures were enriched in infiltrative SE-driven genes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>). Sixteen of these infiltrative SE-driven genes had value in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) datasets <bold>(Supplementary Figure 1D)</bold>. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering revealed that infiltrative SE-driven clusters showed significant infiltration of memory, regulatory, and helper T cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F–H</xref>). The protein expression present in 70 PD-L1 positive GC tumor tissues was assessed, and high immunohistochemistry (IHC) scores were determined in PD-L1 infiltrative GC compared with those in expanding GC (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1I</xref>). These results helped describe the SE-driven immune escape signatures of infiltrative GC.</p>

<sec id="s3b">
<title><italic>ZFP36L1</italic> as an SE-driven oncogene in infiltrative GC</title>
<p><italic>ZFP36L1</italic> was selected among these 16 genes based on Friends analysis and a comprehensive exploration of the TCGA data (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). The mRNA expression in GC correlated positively with high T stage, tumor grade, diffuse type, and <italic>Helicobacter pylori</italic> infection (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>) and negatively correlated with overall survival, disease-specific survival and progression-free interval <bold>(Supplementary Figure 1E)</bold>. Notably, high <italic>ZFP36L1</italic> expression represented high Tumor Immune Dysfunction and Exclusion (TIDE) scores, T-cell infiltration and high CD274 expression (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C–E</xref>). Therefore, we speculated that ZFP36L1 is a key molecule for immune escape in infiltrative GC, and ZFP36L1-SE (chr14:68806839–68816867) is a probable cause of transcriptional dysregulation as it is situated upstream of the <italic>ZFP36L1</italic> promoter (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F, G</xref>). This genomic region harbors two typical enhancers (E1:68806839–68807740 and E2:68816088–68816867) and shows a plethora of histone acetylation enrichments in infiltrative GC tissues, as well as in MKN45 and AGS cell lines. A similar trend was observed at the protein level in this study. In the 12 paired infiltrative GC samples, ZFP36L1 protein expression was higher in 10 primary neoplasms than that in normal adjacent tissues (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2H</xref>). Additionally, various GC cell lines exhibited high ZFP36L1 expression compared with that in the normal gastric epithelial cell line, GES-1 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2I</xref>).</p>

<p>To validate whether ZFP36L1 was driven by the SEs, XGC-1 and MKN45 cells were treated with the SE inhibitors THZ1 and JQ1. We observed that THZ1 and JQ1 inhibited mRNA and protein expression of ZFP36L1 in a concentration- and time-dependent manner, respectively (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2J</xref>). Moreover, ChIP experiments revealed that JQ1 decreased H3K27ac enrichment in ZFP36L1-SE region, especially in E1 region (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2K</xref>). These findings suggest that <italic>ZFP36L1</italic> is a key SE-driven oncogene involved in infiltrating GC.</p>

<title>ZFP36L1 promotes IFN-γ-induced PD-L1 expression</title>
<p>Given the aforementioned results, we speculated that ZFP36L1 contributes to heightened PD-L1 expression in infiltrative GC. Typically, IFN-γ derived from T cells triggers PD-L1 overexpression on the surface of GC cells. In vitro experiments were conducted to simulate the immune microenvironment by adding exogenous IFN-γ at a concentration of 40 ng/mL, exacerbating PD-L1 expression on GC cells. However, in <italic>ZFP36L1</italic>-knockdown XGC-1 and MKN45 GC cell lines, IFN- γ-induced PD-L1 transcription levels were lower compared with that in the control group (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). Conversely, we observed a significant increase in IFN-γ-induced PD-L1 mRNA expression in XGC-2 and MGC803 cell lines overexpressing <italic>ZFP36L1</italic> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). These results indicate that ZFP36L1 potentiates IFN-γ-induced PD-L1 transcription.</p>

<p>At the protein level, knocking down <italic>ZFP36L1</italic> in the XGC-1 and MKN45 cell lines similarly reduced IFN-γ-induced PD-L1 protein expression (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>). Conversely, overexpression of <italic>ZFP36L1</italic> in the XGC-2 and MGC803 cell lines facilitated IFN-γ-induced PD-L1 protein expression (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>). Flow cytometry revealed a consistent trend in the expression levels of PD-L1 on the tumor cell membrane surface.

<title>SPI1 binding to the SE region of <italic>ZFP36L1</italic></title>
<p>To identify the upstream TF driving the SE-associated oncogene, the MEME-ChIP online tool was used to identify TF-binding sites in ZFP36L1-SE. Given the high GC content of E2, which is JQ1-insensitive, only the sequence motifs enriched in E1 (motif ID: GRGGMAGGARG) were examined. <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref> lists the predicted TFs and corresponding DNA motifs, including ETS transcription factor family (such as SPI1, ELF1 and ETS1) and E2F transcription factor family (such as E2F1 and E2F6). SPI1, ELF1, and E2F1 were confirmed using another online analysis tool based on ChIP-seq data from the Signaling Pathways Project. Among these, SPI1 is a known interferon regulatory TF that modulates PD-L1 mRNA expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>]. Moreover, querying TCGA data revealed an association between SPI1 expression and poor prognosis (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>). Consequently, we speculated that SPI1 is a tissue-specific TF driving ZFP36L1 transcription by activating the SE region.</p>

<p>To validate this hypothesis, MKN45 cells were transfected with <italic>SPI1</italic>, <italic>ELF1</italic>, <italic>E2F1</italic>, and control plasmids. The RT-PCR results indicated that only transfection with SPI1 upregulated the <italic>ZFP36L1</italic> mRNA level (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>). Similarly, <italic>SPI1</italic> overexpression increased the ZFP36L1 protein levels in MKN45 and MGC803 cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>). TCGA data revealed that <italic>SPI1</italic> mRNA expression positively correlated with PD-L1 expression in patients with stomach cancer (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>). Overexpression of <italic>SPI1</italic> increased IFN-γ-induced PD-L1 protein amount and fluorescent signal at membrane surfaces in GC cells, but concurrent knockdown of <italic>ZFP36L1</italic> could reverse the results of PD-L1 expression <bold>(</bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref><bold> and Supplementary Figure 1F)</bold>. These findings suggest that SPI1 regulates PD-L1 expression in a ZFP36L1-dependent manner.</p>
<p>Further analysis of protein-protein interaction networks using STRING indicated that SPI1 might interact with BRD4 and P300 proteins, which are SE-labeled molecules (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4G</xref>). Subsequently, the formation of the transcriptional complex comprising SPI1 and BRD4 was investigated. Exogenous BRD4 co-immunoprecipitated with exogenous SPI1 in 293T cells co-transfected with two plasmids, as observed using the anti-Flag affinity resin (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4H</xref>). In MGC803 cells, endogenous SPI1 immunoprecipitated with endogenous BRD4 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4I</xref>). Additionally, we constructed a prokaryotic expression system of SPI1 and BRD4, and performed protein purification and GST pull-down assays (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4J</xref>). These results indicate that SPI1 and BRD4 directly bind in vitro, reflecting the specificity of SE-associated TFs.</p>
<p>To assess SE activity and TF occupancy, the E1 fragment was inserted into the luciferase reporter pGL4-Basic vector. In 293T cells, luciferase signals were enhanced when the <italic>SPI1</italic> plasmid, instead of <italic>ELF1</italic> or <italic>E2F1</italic>, was co-transfected with pGL4-E1 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4K</xref>). This indicates a well-defined binding site for SPI1 in the ZFP36L1-E1 region, consistent with previous RT-PCR results. The six predicted DNA sequence motifs in the E1 region are distributed among four DNA-binding sites, with sites C and D containing two adjacent DNA sequence motifs.</p>
<p>Subsequently, we performed ChIP experiments using SPI1 antibodies to immunoprecipitate bound DNA fragments in MGC803 cells, followed by RT-PCR analysis of the products. Among these endogenous SPI1 binding sites, the abundance of the site C product was the highest (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4L</xref>). Consequently, four truncated E1 fragments containing different binding sites were inserted into the luciferase reporter vector (E1A-E1D). As anticipated, we observed significantly enhanced luciferase activity upon co-transfection with the SPI1 and pGL4-E1C plasmids (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4M</xref>). Furthermore, two motifs totaling 15 bp were deleted from site C to construct a plasmid with a deletion mutation. The transcriptional activation of SPI1 was abrogated in the deletion mutation group compared with that in the wild-type group (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4N</xref>). These results suggest that site C is the SPI1 binding region in ZFP36L1-SE.</p>

<title>Upregulation of PD-L1 mediated by <italic>HDAC3</italic> mRNA decay</title>
<p>To identify downstream target genes, the mRNA transcripts bound to ZFP36L1 were searched against the RNAct website. A bibliometric analysis via PubMed suggested that 51 gene transcripts may be associated with PD-L1 expression (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). Representative molecules were selected to perform preliminary verification, which revealed that <italic>HDAC3</italic> mRNA expression was significantly reduced in MGC803 cells overexpressing ZFP36L1 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>). Conversely, protein levels of HDAC3 increased in XGC-1 and MKN45 cells with <italic>ZFP36L1</italic> knockdown (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>). HDAC3 reportedly represses PD-L1 transcription through histone deacetylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>]. Likewise, we observed that overexpression of <italic>HDAC3</italic> does not directly affect PD-L1 promoter activity (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>), but inhibits PD-L1 transcription through histone H3K27 deacetylation in the promoter region (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E, F</xref>). Additionally, histone H3K27 deacetylation is also detrimental to the transcriptional activity of ZFP36L1-E1. Therefore, we conducted rescue experiments involving <italic>HDAC3</italic> plasmid co-transfection. The PD-L1-inducing effects of IFN-γ were reinforced in cell lines overexpressing <italic>ZFP36L1</italic> (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5I, J</xref>). However, PD-L1 protein levels and surface fluorescent signals decreased when <italic>HDAC3</italic> was simultaneously overexpressed. Additionally, the effects of <italic>SPI1</italic> overexpression were rescued when <italic>HDAC3</italic> expression was concurrently restored in MGC803 and MKN45 cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5K, L</xref>). These findings suggest that SE-driven ZFP36L1 positively regulates PD-L1 expression by inhibiting HDAC3. The inhibition of HDAC3 additionally provide positive feedback to promote <italic>ZFP36L1</italic> transcription.</p>

<p>Actinomycin D was employed to assess the rate of <italic>HDAC3</italic> mRNA degradation. <italic>ZFP36L1</italic> knockdown in MKN45 cells led to an increased half-life of <italic>HDAC3</italic> mRNA post-actinomycin D treatment, indicating enhanced mRNA stability and suppression of mRNA decay. Conversely, <italic>ZFP36L1</italic> overexpression in MGC803 cells promoted mRNA degradation, impairing <italic>HDAC3</italic> mRNA stability (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5M</xref>). This observation suggests that ZFP36L1 influences <italic>HDAC3</italic> mRNA decay.</p>
<p>To further elucidate the mechanism of RNA-binding protein leading to mRNA deadenylation, we conducted a series of experiments. Initially, we validated the direct binding of ZFP36L1 protein to the 3ʹUTR region of <italic>HDAC3</italic> mRNA via RNA immunoprecipitation. Owing to the lack of highly potent ZFP36L1 antibodies, RNA fragments were enriched using an anti-FLAG antibody in MGC803 cells overexpressing exogenous FLAG-tagged ZFP36L1. While we observed no significant change in HPRT1 mRNA (negative control), the abundance of HDAC3 mRNA fragments was amplified in the immunoprecipitated products (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5N</xref>).</p>
<p>Subsequently, the binding site in the ARE of the 3ʹUTR was identified. Classical binding motifs of the ZFP36 protein family, such as “WTTTW” and “WWTTTWW,” were considered. The 3ʹUTR sequences of <italic>HDAC3</italic> mRNA were examined, revealing that only “ATTTA” fulfilled the requirements. The 3ʹUTR sequences and pmirGLO vectors were used to introduce a point mutation into the luciferase reporter gene plasmid, where the central base sequence of “ATTTA” was substituted with “ ACCCA. ” ZFP36L1 impaired the transcriptional activity of the wild-type plasmid but not the mutant plasmid, directly demonstrating the regulatory site of mRNA decay-promoting activity (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5O</xref>).</p>
<p>Finally, the CCCH-type zinc finger domains were examined to confirm their indispensable role in RNA binding. Accordingly, we mutated two cysteine (C) residues at positions 135 and 173 to arginine (R) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5P</xref>). <italic>HDAC3</italic> mRNA probes were synthesized and co-incubated with extracts of MGC803 cells transfected with a mutant (C135R–C173R) or wild-type plasmid. RNA pull-down assay results revealed that the mutant ZFP36L1 did not bind to the 3ʹUTR of HDAC3 mRNA. Collectively, our findings suggest that ZFP36L1 potentiated PD-L1 expression by promoting <italic>HDAC3</italic> mRNA decay.</p>

<p>Wild-type mice with normal immune function were chosen to explore these regulatory relationships in vivo.

Subsequently, stable knockdown mouse <italic>ZFP36L1</italic> (mZFP36L1) cell lines were established for subcutaneous tumor formation and tail vein assay of lung metastasis (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D</xref>). Although mZFP36L1 knockdown did not impact the size of subcutaneous tumors (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6E</xref>), it led to reduced mRNA and protein expression of mPD-L1 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6F, G</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In the present study, we identified the SE heterogeneity between two subtypes of GC with differential growth patterns. SEs have emerged as a whole novel branch within tumor epigenetics. The direct experimental validation of SEs involves assessing the expression of target genes after the deletion of SE regions via the CRISPR/Cas9 system. In the context of bladder cancer, FOSL1 directly binds to SNHG15-SE, stimulating the Wnt signaling pathway through interactions with SNHG15–CTNNB1, thereby driving malignant behavior [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>]. Exploring different loci enables the identification of crucial SE peaks and their functional roles. For instance, <italic>TOX2</italic> acts as an SE-driven oncogene in extranodal natural killer/T-cell lymphoma, with its transcription governed by the SE-specific TFs, RUNX3. Targeting SE regions with various single-guide RNAs (sgRNAs) has confirmed the pathogenicity of TOX2-SE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>]. While the CRISPR/Cas9 system was not directly investigated in this study, the biological mechanism underlying ZFP36L1-SE was indirectly corroborated using ChIP, BRD4 co-immunoprecipitation (CoIP), and luciferase assays. The interactions between promoters and SEs are reportedly mediated by CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) loops. Recently, researchers have identified novel regulatory elements within SEs, termed “ facilitators, ” which highlights the significance of SE integrity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>]. Furthermore, SEs can transcribe SE RNA (seRNA), which is beneficial for chromatin openness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>]. Collectively, further investigation into the functional architecture of SEs is warranted.</p>
<p>Understanding the mechanisms governing SE formation is currently a prominent area of research. <italic>PDZK1IP1</italic> is an acquired SE-driven oncogene in primary colorectal tumors, with its encoded protein regulating the pentose phosphate pathway to promote tumor redox capability. Although PDZK1IP1–SE does not initially exist in colon cancer cell lines, its production is stimulated by abundant inflammatory factors within the tumor microenvironment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>]. These acquired somatic mutations exert influence over transcriptional epigenetic regulation. Acquired SEs in GC exhibit a high binding affinity for CDX2 or HNF4α, alongside enriched chromatin interactions and cancer-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>]. Liu et al. identified a genetic variation (SNP rs10470352) within the SOX2-SE region through a joint analysis of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and HiChIP. This sequence variation enables TP73/RUNX3 occupancy, promoting active chromatin and upregulating <italic>SOX2</italic> expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>]. However, the infiltration-specific nature of ZFP36L1-SE raises questions regarding whether its pro-tumor function is attributable to somatic mutations.</p>
<p>We demonstrate for the first time that ZFP36L1 driven by ZFP36L1-SE promotes IFN-γ-induced PD-L1 expression. Given that the mRNA of numerous inflammatory factors and oncogenes harbor AREs in their 3ʹUTR, ZFP36 family proteins are typically regarded as anti-tumor and anti-inflammatory agents. Loh et al. proposed that <italic>ZFP36L1</italic> deletion mutations are characteristic of urological tumors owing to their targeting of hypoxic mRNAs or cell cycle markers, such as <italic>HIF1A</italic>, <italic>CCND1</italic>, and <italic>E2F1</italic>, thereby promoting their degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>]. The authors also reported the inhibition of the HDAC family by ZFP36L1. In small-cell lung cancer, inhibition of lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1) triggers <italic>ZFP36L1</italic> expression, leading to the decay of <italic>SOX2</italic> mRNA and attenuation of tumor neuroendocrine differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>]. This highlights the complex role of ZFP36L1, thereby cautioning about simple dichotomy.</p>
<p>Novel treatment regimen in combination with anti-PD-L1 mainly enhanced CD8+ T-cell infiltration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>]. Several studies have proposed that reducing PD-L1 expression enhances the tumor-killing effect of cytotoxic T lymphocytes in vitro and reduces primary tumor foci in vivo. Conversely, findings from this study suggest that PD-L1 expression is associated with immune evasion in metastatic foci [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>]. The upstream regulation of PD-L1 expression occurs at both mRNA and protein levels. The well-established JAK-STAT/IRF1 signaling pathway primarily governs IFN-γ-induced PD-L1 transcription, with certain oncogenes such as <italic>DENR</italic>, <italic>UBR5</italic>, and <italic>SOX10</italic> promoting tumor immune evasion via activation of this pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>]. Additionally, CD274-associated transcriptional regulators include <italic>HIF-1α</italic>, <italic>cMYC</italic>, and <italic>YBX1</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>]. Shang et al. demonstrated that MTHFD2 facilitates O-GlcNAc glycosylation of the c-MYC protein during metabolic reprogramming, thereby activating PD-L1 transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>]. However, ZFP36L1 disrupts <italic>HDAC3</italic> mRNA, leading to PD-L1-mediated immune evasion independent of the aforementioned TFs. It destabilizes the regulatory region of <italic>CD274</italic>, enhances histone acetylation, and promotes chromatin accessibility. Likewise, depletion of <italic>ZNF652</italic> disrupts the formation of the HDAC1/2-MTA3 co-repressor complex, resulting in elevated PD-L1 expression in triple-negative breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>]. Conversely, the m6A reader IGF2BP1 binds to the 3ʹUTR, initiating m6A modification and stabilizing PD-L1 mRNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>].</p>
<p>The regulatory mechanisms governing PD-L1 predominantly involve post-translational modifications and subcellular relocalization. K48-linked deubiquitination by USP2 and N-glycosylation by B4GALT1 stabilize PD-L1 and prevent its degradation. Both K48-linked de-ubiquitination by USP2 and N-glycosylation by B4GALT1 are able to stabilize and prevent degradation of PD-L1 protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>]. TRIM28 overexpression in GC reportedly prevents proteasomal degradation of PD-L1 protein through SUMOylation, as well as promotes PD-L1 transcription by activating the mTOR and TBK1–IRF1 pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>]. However, ZFP36L1 primarily exerts a negative influence on signaling pathways and is not associated with protein modification. In terms of subcellular relocalization, the mitochondrial membrane protein ATAD3A in paclitaxel-resistant breast cancer patients obstructs the mitochondrial translocation and autophagic degradation of PD-L1, resulting in increased membranous PD-L1 expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>]. ZFP36L1 reportedly forms a subcellular compartment with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), facilitating the formation of membrane-less organelles in the TIS11B (ZFP36L1) granule ER domain. Within this domain, the interaction between SET and CD47/CD274, which harbor multiple AREs, promotes membrane protein expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>]; follow-up studies are warranted to comprehensively elucidate its role.</p>
<p>In conclusion, our findings elucidate the regulation of the SPI1–ZFP36L1–HDAC3–PD-L1 axis in infiltrative GC and highlight immune escape signatures driven by SEs. These findings offer complementary insights for the application of immunotherapy in GC.</p>

<p>If the variable is numerical and the sample size is ≤5000, a normality test will be conducted. If the data follow a normal distribution, the mean ± standard deviation of the corresponding variable will be calculated; otherwise, the median (upper and lower quartiles) of the corresponding variable will be reported. For numerical variables that satisfy the normal distribution and pass the variance chi-square test, two-group comparisons will be performed using the T-test, and three-group comparisons will use One-way ANOVA. If the data satisfy the normal distribution but fail the variance chi-square test, two-group comparisons will be conducted using Welch’s t-test, and three-group comparisons will use Welch’s one-way ANOVA. If the data do not satisfy the normal distribution assumption, two-group comparisons will use Welch’s one-way ANOVA. For normally distributed data, two-group comparisons will use the Wilcoxon test, and three-group comparisons will use the Kruskal-Wallis test.</p>
<p>If the variables are categorical and the data satisfy the condition of theoretical frequency &gt; 5 with a total sample size ≥ 40, group comparisons will use the chi-square test. When the data meet the condition of 1 ≤ theoretical frequency ≤ 5 and the total sample size ≥ 40, group comparisons will use the corrected chi-square test (Yates’ correction). If the data do not meet the conditions of theoretical frequency &lt;1 or total sample size &lt;40, group comparisons will utilize Fisher’s exact test.</p>

<sec id="s13b1">
<label>3.3.1</label><title>Tissue Preparation</title>
<p>Fresh tissue specimens are immersed in formalin fixative solution and incubated overnight at 4°C on a shaker. Tissues are dehydrated using an automatic dehydration instrument, embedded in paraffin using a paraffin embedding machine, and stored as tissue blocks at -20°C. Tissue sections of 4 μm thickness are prepared using a microtome, followed by flattening, lifting, and drying in a dark place.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s13b2">
<label>3.3.2</label><title>Deparaffinization</title>
<p>Slides are baked at 65°C in a constant temperature chamber for 6-24 hours.</p>
<p>Before staining, slides are deparaffinized to water. This involves sequential immersion in decreasing concentrations of ethanol: xylene substitute for 10 minutes, absolute ethanol for 2 minutes, 95% ethanol for 2 minutes, 75% ethanol for 2 minutes, and finally pure water, with each step repeated twice. For Hematoxylin-Eosin (HE) staining, slides are directly stained with hematoxylin for 3 minutes, followed by 10 seconds of decolorization in hydrochloric acid ethanol and rinsing in pure water for 5 minutes. Then, slides are stained with eosin for 30 seconds before proceeding to step 5 for mounting.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s13b3">
<label>3.3.3</label><title>Antigen Retrieval</title>
<p>Antigen retrieval is performed using high-pressure steam. Slides are placed in a metal dish filled with sodium citrate buffer solution and completely submerged. The dish is then placed in a preheated boiling pressure cooker and sealed. The heating plate is set to maximum power. Once the pressure cooker reaches maximum pressure and the valve releases steam for 2 minutes, the heating plate is turned off. After waiting for 30 minutes, the lid is opened, and the slides are cooled at room temperature for 2 hours.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s13b4">
<label>3.3.4</label><title>Immunostaining</title>
<p>Immunohistochemical experiments are conducted using an immunostaining kit. The specific steps are as follows: Wash the fixed sections with PBS solution for 3 minutes × 2 times, then rinse with PBS for the third time. Apply endogenous peroxidase blocker to the defined tissue area on the slide and incubate at room temperature for 10 minutes. Wash the slides with PBS for 3 minutes × 3 times, remove PBS, apply nonspecific staining blocker, and incubate at room temperature for 10 minutes. Apply primary antibody (diluted at 1:500) and incubate overnight at 4°C. Wash the slides with PBS for 3 minutes × 3 times, remove PBS, apply biotinylated goat anti-mouse/rabbit IgG polymer, and incubate at room temperature for 10 minutes. Wash the slides with PBS for 3 minutes × 3 times, remove PBS, apply streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase, and incubate at room temperature for 10 minutes. Apply freshly prepared DAB staining solution and incubate at room temperature for 2 minutes.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s13b5">
<label>3.3.5</label><title>Mounting</title>
<p>Slides are counterstained with hematoxylin, incubated at room temperature for 3 minutes, followed by decolorization in hydrochloric acid ethanol for 10 seconds, and then rinsed under running water for 15 minutes. Slides are dehydrated using a reverse deparaffinization process: 75% ethanol for 2 minutes, 95% ethanol for 2 minutes, absolute ethanol for 2 minutes, and finally xylene substitute for 5 minutes, with each step repeated twice. After thorough ventilation drying, slides are mounted with neutral resin.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s13b6">
<label>3.3.6</label><title>Immunohistochemistry Scoring</title>
<p>The scoring is based on the staining extent of positive tumor cells in the tissue: &lt;25% scores 1 point, 25%∼50% scores 2 points, 50%∼75% scores 3 points, and ≥75% scores 4 points. Staining intensity is scored as follows: no staining (0 points), weak positive (1 point), moderate positive (2 points), and strong positive (3 points). The final score is obtained by multiplying the scores of staining extent and intensity. High expression is defined as 5 points or above, while low expression is less than 5 points.</p>

<label>3.3.1</label><title>RNA Sample Preparation</title>
<p>Total RNA extraction was conducted using a cell total RNA extraction kit. Specifically, 500 μL of Buffer RL was added to each well of a 6-well plate to lyse cells. After thorough cell lysis, the lysate was transferred to gDNA filter columns and centrifuged at 12000 rpm for 30 seconds to collect the filtrate. Subsequently, 250 μL of ethanol was added, mixed well, and transferred to RNA adsorption columns, followed by centrifugation at 12000 rpm for 30 seconds, and the flow-through was discarded. Washing steps were performed with 700 μL of Buffer RW1 and Buffer RW2, each followed by centrifugation and discarding of the flow-through. Finally, 500 μL of Buffer RW2 was added, centrifuged at 12000 rpm for 2 minutes, and the flow-through was discarded. The RNA adsorption column was transferred to a 1.5 mL centrifuge tube, and 50 μL of RNase-free ddH2O preheated to 65°C was added to the center of the column. After incubating at room temperature for 2 minutes, RNA was eluted by centrifugation at 12000 rpm for 1 minute, and the concentration was measured.</p>

<label>3.3.2</label><title>RNA Reverse Transcription</title>
<p>Each sample tube containing 2 μg of RNA template was adjusted to a volume of 7 μL with DEPC water. The mixture was denatured at 65°C for 5 minutes and then chilled on ice for 2 minutes. Reverse transcription reactions were performed using the HiFi-MMLV cDNA first-strand synthesis kit. Each reaction was set up with 4 μL of dNTP Mix, 4 μL of 5×RT Buffer, 2 μL of Primer Mix, 2 μL of DTT, and 1 μL of HiFi-MMLV. The thoroughly mixed 13 μL reaction mixture was added to 7 μL of RNA template, followed by incubation at 42°C for 50 minutes and then at 85°C for 5 minutes to complete reverse transcription.</p>

<label>3.3.3</label><title>Real-time Fluorescent Quantitative PCR (RT-PCR)</title>
<p>The obtained cDNA was diluted 2-fold for use as RT-PCR templates. Each reaction well was filled with 10 μL of 2×UltraSYBR Mixture, 0.6 μL each of upstream and downstream primers for the target gene, and 6.8 μL of ddH2O. After thorough mixing and centrifugation, 2 μL of diluted cDNA template was added to each reaction well, followed by the addition of 18 μL of the above mixed system. The RT-qPCR program consisted of three steps: initial denaturation at 95°C for 10 minutes, followed by 40 cycles of PCR amplification (95°C for 10 seconds, 60°C for 30 seconds, and 72°C for 32 seconds), and finally, a melting curve analysis (95°C for 15 seconds, 60°C for 60 seconds, 95°C for 15 seconds, and 60°C for 15 seconds).</p>

<p>In this paper, the authors provide data to support the existence of a regulatory pathway starting with SPI1-driven ZFP36L1 expression, that goes on to downregulate HDAC3 expression at the transcript level, leading to PD-L1 upregulation due to implied enhanced acetylation of its promoter region. This is therefore an interesting pathway that adds to our understanding of how PD-L1 expression is controlled in gastric cancer. However, this is likely one of many possible pathways that impact PD-L1 expression, which is likely equally important. Thus, while potentially interesting, this is more additive information to the literature rather than a fundamentally new concept/finding.</p>
<p>Overall, there are many experiments presented, which appear to be of good quality, however, there are a number of issues with this that need attention. Moreover, the text is often difficult to follow, partly due to the standard of English, but mainly due to the sparsity of detail in the results section and figure legends. Thus providing an overall assessment of data conclusiveness is not possible at this time. This is exacerbated by frequently extrapolating conclusions beyond what is actually shown in an individual experiment.</p>
<p>Major issues:</p>
<p>(1) All the figure legends need to expand significantly, so it is clear what is being presented. All experiments showing data quantification need the numbers of independent biological replicates to be added, plus an indication of what the P-values are associated with the asterisks (and the tests used).</p>
<p>(2) Related to point 1, the description of the data in the text needs to expand significantly, so the figure panels are interpretable. Examples are given below but this is not an exhaustive list.</p>
<p>(3) The addition of &quot;super-enhancer-driven&quot; to the title is a distraction. This is the starting point but the finding is portrayed by the last part of the title. Moreover, it is not clear why this is a super enhancer rather than just a typical enhancer as only one seems to be relevant and functional. I suggest avoiding this term after initial characterisations.</p>
<p>(4) The descriptions of Figures 1B, C, and D are very poor. How for example do you go from nearly 2000 SE peaks to a couple of hundred target genes? What are the other 90% doing? What is the definition of a target gene? This whole start section needs a complete overhaul to make it understandable and this is important as is what leads us to ZFP36L1 in the first place.</p>
<p>(5) It is impossible to work out what Figures 1F, H, and I are from the accompanying text. The same applies to supplementary Figure S1D. Figure 1G is not described in the results.</p>
<p>(6) What is Figure 2A? There is no axis label or description.</p>
<p>(7) Why is CD274 discussed in the text from Figure 2E but none of the other genes? The rationale needs expanding.</p>
<p>(8) Figure 2G needs zooming in more over the putative SE region and the two enhancers labelling. This looks very strange at the moment and does not show typical peak shapes for histone acetylation at enhancers.</p>
<p>(9) The use of JQ1 does not prove something is a super enhancer, just that it is BRD4 regulated and might be a typical enhancer.</p>
<p>(10) An explanation of how the motifs were identified in E1 is needed. Enrichment over what? Were they purposefully looking for multiple motifs per enhancer? Otherwise what it all comes down to later in the figure is a single motif, and how can that be &quot;enriched&quot;?</p>
<p>(11) A major missing experiment is to deplete rather than over-express SPI1 for the various assays in Figure 4.</p>
<p>(12) The authors start jumping around cell lines, sometimes with little justification. Why is MGC803 used in Figure 4I rather than MKN45? This might be due to more endogenous SPI1. However, this does not make sense in Figure 5M, where ZFP36L is overexpressed in this line rather than MKN45. If SPI1 is already high in MGC803, then the prediction is that ZFP36L1 should already be high. Is this the case?</p>
<p>(13) In Figure 5, HDAC3 should also be depleted to show opposite effects to over-expression (as the latter could be artefactual). Also, direct involvement should be proven by ChIP.</p>
<p>(14) Figure 5G and H are not discussed in the text.</p>
<p>(15) Figure 6C needs explaining. Why are three patients selected here? Are these supposed to be illustrative of the whole cohort? What sub-type of GC are these?</p>
<p>(16) In Figure 6E onwards, they switch to MFC cell line. They provide a rationale but the key regulatory axis should be sown to also be operational in these cells to use this as a model system.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This manuscript by Wei et al studies the role of ZFP36L1, an RNA-binding protein, in promoting PD-L1 expression in gastric cancer (GC). They used human gastric cancer tissues from six patients and performed H3K27ac CUT&amp;Tag to unbiasedly identify SE specific for the infiltrative type. They identified an SE driving the expression of ZFP36L1 and immune evasion through upregulation of PD-L1. Mechanistically, they show that SPI1 binds to ZFP36L1-SE and ZFP36L1 in turn regulates PD-L1 expression through modulation of the 3'UTR of HDAC3. This mechanism of PD-L1 regulation in gastric cancer is novel, and ZFP36L1 has not been previously implicated in GC progression. However, the data presented are largely correlations and no direct proof is presented that the identified SE regulates ZFP36L1 expression. Furthermore, the effect of ZFP36L1 manipulation elicited a modest effect on PDL1 expression. In fact, several cell lines (XGC1, MNK45) express abundant ZFP36L1 but no PD-L1, suggesting the ZFP36L1 per se is not a key stimulant of PD-L1 expression as IFNg is. Thus, the central conclusions are not supported by the data.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Use of human GC specimens to identify SE regulating PD-L1 expression and immune evasion.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Major comments:</p>
<p>(1) The difference in H3K27ac over the ZFP36L1 locus and SE between the expanding and infiltrative GC is marginal (Figure 2G). Although the authors establish that ZFP36L1 is upregulated in GC, particularly in the infiltrative subtype, no direct proof is provided that the identified SE is the source of this observation. CRISPR-Cas9 should be employed to delete the identified SE to prove that it is causatively linked to the expression of ZFP36L1.</p>
<p>(2) In Figure 3C the impact of shZFP36L1 on PD-L1 expression is marginal and it is observed in the context of IFNg stimulation. Moreover, in XGC-1 cell line the shZFP36L1 failed to knock down protein expression thus the small decrease in PD-L1 level is likely independent of ZFP36L1. The same is the case in Figure 3D where forced expression of ZFP36L1 does not upregulate the expression of PDL1 and even in the context of IFNg stimulation the effect is marginal.</p>
<p>(3) In Figure 4, it is unclear why ELF1 and E2F1 that bind ZFP36L1-SE do not upregulate its expression and only SPI1 does. In Figure 4D the impact of SPI overexpression on ZFP36L1 in MKN45 cells is marginal. Likewise, the forced expression of SPI did not upregulate PD-L1 which contradicts the model. Only in the context of IFNg PD-L1 is expressed suggesting that whatever role, if any, ZFP36L1-SPI1 axis plays is secondary.</p>
<p>(4) The data presented in Figure 6 are not convincing. First, there is no difference in the tumor growth (Figure 6E). IHC in Figure 6I for CD8a is misleading. Can the authors provide insets to point CD8a cells? This figure also needs quantification and review from a pathologist.</p>

<p>Thank you for your thoughtful comment. In this study, the key molecule ZFP36L1 was identified as a target gene through the characterization of the super-enhancer ZFP36L1-SE. The enrichment of H3K27ac at this site meets the threshold defined by the ROSE algorithm, and transcription of ZFP36L1 is regulated by BRD4, making it susceptible to inhibition by the super-enhancer inhibitor JQ1. Although we were unable to directly observe the effects of knocking out the ZFP36L1-SE via Cas9 due to experimental constraints, we believe that the indirect evidence we have gathered is sufficient to demonstrate the super-enhancer's driving role. This approach is consistent with the conventions of previous studies on super-enhancers.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate your feedback and apologize for the confusion caused by the initial descriptions. As described in the manuscript, the function of SE peaks depends on their location. Figure 1C shows the distribution of these peaks, where &quot;Over 50% of these peaks were located in the non-coding regions such as exons and introns, and their predicted target genes were transcribed to produce non-coding RNAs; the peaks distributed in transcription start and termination sites activated the promoters and directly drove the transcription of protein-coding genes&quot;. Our research focuses on protein-coding genes, and we apologize for any misunderstanding due to the inadequate description. We will provide additional clarification to make this distinction clear.</p>

<p>Thank you for your comment. The role of JQ1 as a super-enhancer inhibitor has been widely reported and recognized in the literature. Its use in experimental studies targeting super-enhancers is a well-established practice. We acknowledge that while JQ1 inhibition indicates BRD4 regulation, it is consistent with the identification of super-enhancers as well.</p>

We aimed to present representative results within the constraints of the manuscript, but if more detailed results from additional cell lines are needed, we can provide them upon request. Regarding your concern, results from the MKN45 cell line are consistent with those observed in MGC803, and these findings are not influenced by SPI1 or ZFP36L1 expression levels.</p>

<p>(13) In Figure 5, HDAC3 should also be depleted to show opposite effects to over-expression (as the latter could be artefactual). Also, direct involvement should be proven by ChIP.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate your feedback. We acknowledge that depleting HDAC3, in addition to overexpressing it, would provide a more comprehensive analysis. Unfortunately, due to experimental constraints, we are unable to include this depletion experiment in the current study. We recognize these limitations and appreciate your understanding. We will consider these aspects for future research. Additionally, we would like to clarify that HDAC3 is a histone deacetylase and not a transcription factor, so it does not directly bind to DNA and therefore is not suitable for ChIP analysis.</p>

<p>(16) Figure 6E onwards, they switch to MFC cell line. They provide a rationale but the key regulatory axis should be sown to also be operational in these cells to use this as a model system.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your comment. We would like to clarify that we used the MC38 cell line, which is a colon cancer cell line, rather than MFC. Our focus was on demonstrating the role of ZFP36L1 in vivo, rather than specifically discussing the regulatory axis in this context. We chose MC38 cells instead of MFC cells due to practical considerations. Specifically, MFC cells were shown in our experiments to be unable to form tumors in wild-type mice, despite previous reports suggesting their tumorigenicity. We will provide a rationale for this choice in the manuscript. We acknowledge that validating the entire regulatory axis in the MC38 cell line would enhance the study's depth. However, due to experimental constraints, we are unable to complete this additional validation. We appreciate your understanding and will consider this aspect for future research.</p>

<p>(17) The difference in H3K27ac over the ZFP36L1 locus and SE between the expanding and infiltrative GC is marginal (Figure 2G). Although the authors establish that ZFP36L1 is upregulated in GC, particularly in the infiltrative subtype, no direct proof is provided that the identified SE is the source of this observation. CRISPR-Cas9 should be employed to delete the identified SE to prove that it is causatively linked to the expression of ZFP36L1.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your thoughtful comment. In this study, the key molecule ZFP36L1 was identified as a target gene through the characterization of the super-enhancer ZFP36L1-SE. The enrichment of H3K27ac at this site meets the threshold defined by the ROSE algorithm, and transcription of ZFP36L1 is regulated by BRD4, making it susceptible to inhibition by the super-enhancer inhibitor JQ1. Although we were unable to directly observe the effects of knocking out the ZFP36L1-SE via Cas9 due to experimental constraints, we believe that the indirect evidence we have gathered is sufficient to demonstrate the super-enhancer's driving role. This approach is consistent with the conventions of previous studies on super-enhancers.</p>

<p>(18) In Figure 3C the impact of shZFP36L1 on PD-L1 expression is marginal and it is observed in the context of IFNg stimulation. Moreover, in XGC-1 cell line the shZFP36L1 failed to knock down protein expression thus the small decrease in PD-L1 level is likely independent of ZFP36L1. The same is the case in Figure 3D where forced expression of ZFP36L1 does not upregulate the expression of PDL1 and even in the context of IFNg stimulation the effect is marginal.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your detailed observations. In our study, the regulatory effect of ZFP36L1 on PD-L1 was validated at the mRNA level, protein level, and through flow cytometry, with each experiment being repeated multiple times. The results of the Western blot were quantitatively assessed using densitometry rather than relying solely on visual inspection. It is important to note that interferon-gamma (IFNγ) stimulation significantly enhances PD-L1 expression, which under the same exposure conditions, may make the baseline expression of PD-L1 appear unchanged. This could explain the marginal effect observed under IFNγ stimulation.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(19) In Figure 4, it is unclear why ELF1 and E2F1 that bind ZFP36L1-SE do not upregulate its expression and only SPI1 does. In Figure 4D the impact of SPI overexpression on ZFP36L1 in MKN45 cells is marginal. Likewise, the forced expression of SPI did not upregulate PD-L1 which contradicts the model. Only in the context of IFNg PD-L1 is expressed suggesting that whatever role, if any, ZFP36L1-SPI1 axis plays is secondary.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your insightful comments. First, ELF1, E2F1, and SPI1 were predicted transcription factors, and experimental validation is crucial. Our results specifically demonstrate that only SPI1 binds to ZFP36L1-SE, while ELF1 and E2F1 do not, confirming the specificity of SPI1. Second, Second, as mentioned in point (18), experimental results, such as those from western blot, should not be evaluated by eye alone. Our findings are quantitatively assessed, and the regulatory relationships have been confirmed through repeated experiments. This finding is supported by multiple experimental validations, including mRNA, protein, and flow cytometry analyses. Furthermore, using IFNγ to study the regulation of PD-L1 is a common and widely accepted approach in this field. Many studies adopt this model, and it should not be concluded that the axis is secondary simply because PD-L1 expression is observed primarily under IFNγ stimulation. Similarly, other popular research areas, such as ferroptosis and autophagy, also use specific inducers, but this does not diminish the significance of the pathways being studied.</p>

<p>(20) The data presented in Figure 6 are not convincing. First, there is no difference in the tumor growth (Figure 6E). IHC in Figure 6I for CD8a is misleading. Can the authors provide insets to point CD8a cells? This figure also needs quantification and review from a pathologist.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Regarding this observation, we will provide an explanation in the discussion section: &quot;Several studies have proposed that reducing PD-L1 expression enhances the tumor-killing effect of cytotoxic T lymphocytes in vitro and reduces primary tumor foci in vivo. Conversely, findings from this study suggest that PD-L1 expression is associated with immune evasion in metastatic foci.&quot; We are unsure why those studies concluded that PD-L1 expression levels would impact the size of the primary tumor. We are more inclined to support the perspective of John et al.Klement JD, Redd PS, Lu C, et al. Tumor PD-L1 engages myeloid PD-1 to suppress type I interferon to impair cytotoxic T lymphocyte recruitment. Cancer Cell. 2023;41(3):620-636.e9. doi:10.1016/j.ccell.2023.02.005</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your question. In Figure 2A, the &quot;high&quot; and &quot;low&quot; categories on the x-axis are derived from the Friends analysis. This analysis is designed to compare the similarity between different genes or gene sets based on semantic similarity metrics from Gene Ontology (GO). The x-axis represents the semantic similarity score, which reflects how closely related the functions of the genes or gene sets are. This helps in identifying the most significant genes or those related to specific pathways or cell types of interest.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>SEs are composed of multiple TEs. ZFP36L1-E1 is a core element of the ZFP36L1-SE. Due to the excessive length of the ZFP36L1-SE sequence, it was not feasible to insert the entire SE into a dual-luciferase reporter plasmid. It is a common practice to validate such experiments by inserting the typical enhancer elements instead.</p>
