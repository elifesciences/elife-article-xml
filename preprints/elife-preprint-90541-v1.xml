<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Microtubule asters are essential in localizing the action of microtubules in processes including mitosis and organelle positioning. In large cells, such as the one-cell sea urchin embryo, aster dynamics are dominated by hydrodynamic pulling forces. However, in systems with more densely positioned nuclei such as the early <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryo, which packs around 6000 nuclei within the syncytium in a crystalline-like order, it is unclear what processes dominate aster dynamics. Here, we take advantage of a cell cycle regulation <italic>Drosophila</italic> mutant to generate embryos with multiple asters, independent from nuclei. We use an <italic>ex vivo</italic> assay to further simplify this biological system to explore the forces generated by and between asters. Through live imaging, drug and optical perturbations, and theoretical modelling, we demonstrate that these asters likely generate an effective pushing force over short distances.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Eukaryotes assemble a cytoskeletal structure of microtubules (MTs) called an ‘aster’, which is involved in critical cell functions including intracellular positioning and organelle transport. In metazoan cells, the aster acquires a radial shape in which MTs are focused by the centrosome and emanate towards the cell periphery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Wilson, 1986</xref>). Microtubules grow at the centrosome and at microtubule-based nucleation sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Ishihara et al., 2016</xref>). The centrosome is also found at the two focus points of the mitotic spindle – the poles – linking the aster structurally and mechanically to the spindle, thus lending it a decisive role during cell division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Hinchcliffe and Sluder, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Hoffmann, 2021</xref>). Positioning of the spindle by astral microtubules contacting the cell cortex determines the cell wall cleavage location (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Field et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Mitchison et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Rappaport, 1969</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">1961</xref>). During fertilization, the maternal and paternal genomes are united by the assembly and migration of the sperm aster, which facilitates transport of the female towards the male pronucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Chambers, 1939</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Hamaguchi and Hiramoto, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Riparbelli et al., 2000</xref>). Where the sperm aster positions inside the egg will roughly define the geometry of the first embryonic cleavage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Albertson, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Hamaguchi and Hiramoto, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Hirano and Ishikawa, 1979</xref>). Interestingly, in these large egg cells the aster migration can also occur without microtubules contacting the cell periphery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Wühr et al., 2010</xref>). Uninuclear cells contain one or, at most, two asters depending on the cell cycle stage.</p>
<p>The mechanics of aster movement has been a matter of long discourse, so far without any consensus on a unified biophysical model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Deshpande and Telley, 2021</xref>). Disagreement remains likely because the experimental insight stems from different model organisms and cells which, by nature, have evolved divergent mechanisms of aster positioning. One fundamental question, whether asters position themselves by pulling on or by pushing at the rigid cell periphery, remains extensively debated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Garzon-Coral et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Grill and Hyman, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Meaders et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Sulerud et al., 2020</xref>). Recently, an adaptation of the pulling model for cortex contact–free asters in large cells has gained new momentum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Hamaguchi and Hiramoto, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Simone et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Tanimoto et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Xie et al., 2022</xref>). In this model, the net force moving the aster originates from a balance of viscous drag forces of moving organelles along astral microtubules with different length. Overall geometric asymmetry of the aster is a key point of this model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Tanimoto et al., 2016</xref>).</p>
<p>An interesting yet understudied case of higher complexity is the positioning of multiple nuclei and their associated asters in multinucleated cells (coenocytes). In the syncytial embryo of insects, such as the fruit fly, the genome is rapidly proliferated and distributed without cell cleavage, leading to a single large cell with hundreds of nuclei (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Donoughe and Extavour, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Foe and Alberts, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Sommer and Tautz, 1991</xref>). The positioning of these syncytial nuclei depends on the centrosome-nucleated microtubule aster (de-Carvalho et al., 2022; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Megraw et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Telley et al., 2012</xref>) and microtubule-associated crosslinking proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Deshpande et al., 2021</xref>). Separation of more than two asters in the absence of intermittent cell cortex boundary formation poses an additional challenge to the cell. Ultimately, a net force is required such that each aster is evenly and stably separated from its neighbors, of which there are on average six (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Kanesaki et al., 2011</xref>). Recent work from us has suggested that short-ranged aster repulsion positions nuclei in a regular order within the syncytial embryo (de-Carvalho et al., 2022). However, experimental testing of these forces is still missing.</p>
<p>Here, by exploiting embryonic explants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Telley et al., 2013</xref>), which reduces complexity, and a cell cycle regulation mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Freeman et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Lee et al., 2003</xref>) to uncouple microtubule organization from nuclear division, we have studied the dynamics of aster-aster interaction bottom-up. In this system, we uncover the physical principles of separation for simple aster arrays, reveal the positional autonomy of single asters, and derive the microtubule-associated mechanical separation potential. Our work reveals the underlying local mechanics between the structures that lend order to a rapidly proliferating embryonic system.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Asters are radial microtubule structures nucleated by the centrosome, which acts as microtubule organizing center (MTOC) as part of the mitotic spindle pole. In the early <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryo, the MTOC is physically connected to the nucleus throughout the cell cycle. To uncouple nucleus and aster associated forces we took advantage of <italic>giant nuclei (gnu)</italic> mutant <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos. In these embryos, DNA endoreplication occurs without mitosis as the cell cycle is arrested in interphase. This results in the embryo having only one or just a few polyploid nuclei. Yet, centrosome maturation and duplication continue in <italic>gnu</italic> embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Freeman et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Freeman and Glover, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Lee et al., 2003</xref>) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). We produced embryo explants from <italic>gnu</italic> mutant embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Telley et al., 2013</xref>) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>) and studied the positioning properties of a small number of microtubule asters in the absence of nuclei. These explants exhibit a high aspect ratio with circular planar shape and &lt;10 µm peak height. Thus, for the purpose of kinematic analysis we treated them as quasi-2D spaces.</p>

<title>Single aster positioning is consistent with radially symmetric forces</title>
<p>Initially, we focused on explants containing a single aster. A single aster consistently moved away from the explant boundary and eventually adopted a steady position (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref> and Video 1 left). In a series of experiments, we deposited extract and waited 30 min, after which we measured the shortest distance <italic>b</italic> of the centrosome from the boundary at steady state. This distance varied between <italic>R</italic>/2 and <italic>R</italic>, with <italic>R</italic> being the explant radius (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>). Deviation from precise centering (<italic>b</italic>=<italic>R</italic>) may be due to yolk or lipid droplets (magenta circles in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>) forming exclusion zones. In large explants it is conceivable that aster centering is not achieved. We also note that in some explants the single aster was by chance already positioned near the center, and no further migration occurred. To obtain more detailed insight, we analyzed the kinematics of single asters located near the boundary after cytosol deposition (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>). Typically, they stayed for up to 10 min (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F</xref>, phase I), but they always eventually migrated (Video 1, left). Single asters moved rapidly after separation from the boundary, with a maximum velocity of 0.05 ± 0.02 µm/s (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F</xref>, phase II), at around 20% of its final distance from the explant boundary (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1G</xref>), before decelerating (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F</xref>, phase III) and stopping 30-35 μm from the boundary at most (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>).</p>
<p>We then measured the radial intensity profile of single asters in explants as a proxy for aster size and microtubule length (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1H</xref>, inset). We initially focused on asters near the center of the explants. Away from the MTOC, the distribution was well approximated with a mono-exponential decay with decay length of ∼12 µm (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1H</xref>). This value agrees with the size of asters associated to telophase and early interphase nuclei of wildtype embryo explants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Telley et al., 2012</xref>). The signal drops to background level at ∼30 µm, suggesting that few microtubules are longer. We also looked at the microtubule distribution in asters positioned near the explant boundary. The microtubule signal towards the explant boundary was noticeably reduced (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>, <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>) suggesting fewer microtubules reach a length equal to the boundary distance <italic>b</italic>. In some samples we observed splay of microtubules when the aster was near the explant boundary (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1I</xref>), consistent with microtubules pushing against the boundary.</p>
<p>In summary, a single aster moves away from a cytoplasmic boundary and, provided sufficient space, reaches a boundary separation distance comparable to aster size. The motility displays three distinct dynamic phases: first, a very slow phase (at least along the radial axis) as they separate from the edge; second, a rapid motion away from the explant boundary; and finally, a gradually slowing down as they migrate towards the explant center (as evidenced in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D-F</xref>). The initial phase of separation may be due to splay of microtubules near the boundary edge (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1I</xref>). In our movies (e.g., Video 1 left), we see random fluctuations in the movement of the aster and the surrounding cytoplasm while the aster is close to the explant boundary. These may be sufficient to release the aster eventually from the boundary (transition from Phase I to Phase II, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F</xref>). These observations are consistent with the asters generating a repulsive potential that decays to zero for distances &gt;30μm and is also inefficient at very short distances (&lt;3μm).</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<title>Lipid droplet movements in extract are consistent with a repulsive aster potential</title>
<p>Embryos contain high amounts of lipid droplets, which serve as fiduciary markers in our explants to study hydrodynamic flow. We next examined the movement of these droplets as the aster moved through the explant (small spheres in Video 1). We observed an approximately circular droplet exclusion zone of ∼10 μm radius (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A-B</xref>), which maintained during aster migration (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>). This is suggestive of a repulsive interaction between the aster and lipid droplets, at least over distances on the order of 10 μm. Next, we quantified the lipid droplet speed with and without an aster present (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>). As the aster moved through the lipid droplets, their speed increased, before reducing once the aster came to a halt. This further supports that the aster is interacting directly with the lipid droplets. We also calculated the mean-squared displacement (MSD) of the lipid droplets with and without an aster present in the explant (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>). The droplets clearly displaced further when an aster was present. The scaling of MSD with time is indicative of the dynamic mode, <italic>x</italic><sub><italic>ms</italic></sub>∼<italic>t</italic><sup><italic>α</italic></sup>. For <italic>α</italic> ≈ 1, the motion can be approximated as diffusion-like, whereas <italic>α</italic> &gt; 1 implies directionality in the droplet movement. With and without an aster the mode of motion was <italic>α</italic> ≈ 1.5 ± 0.1 and <italic>α</italic> ≈ 1.3 ± 0.1, respectively. Directionality is increased in the presence of an aster, though it is noteworthy that droplet motion is not independent (<italic>i.e</italic>., diffusive-like) in the absence of an aster.</p>

<title>Aster-aster interactions are consistent with a repulsive potential involving short-ranged inhibition</title>
<p>Some explants contained a pair of asters that separated and adopted a steady-state inter-aster distance (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref> and Video 1, right). At steady-state, the aster-aster interaction must balance with the forces involved in moving each aster away from the boundary. Our previous experiments indicate that this aster-boundary force decays with distance. From the perspective of the first aster, we may assume the second aster forms a local boundary – which is movable – and associate a similar force generation property between the first and the second aster. The resulting mechanical configuration is likely symmetric so that aster 1 and aster 2 are interchangeable. Force balance considerations (see Methods) provide a testable hypothesis: If the force occurring between the two asters (<italic>F</italic><sub><italic>a</italic>↔<italic>a</italic></sub>) or between an aster and the boundary (<italic>F</italic><sub><italic>a</italic>↔<italic>b</italic></sub>) have identical mechanical properties, <italic>i.e</italic>., the same amplitude and length parameters, we expect the asters to be positioned at a distance <italic>R</italic> apart. Thus, we measured the final distance <italic>d</italic> between the centrosomes of the two asters, as well as the boundary distances <italic>b<sub>1</sub></italic> and <italic>b<sub>2</sub></italic> for asters 1 and 2, respectively, and the explant radius, <italic>R</italic>. Interestingly, we find that the two asters approximately partitioned the available space (<italic>d</italic> = <italic>b</italic><sub>1</sub> = <italic>b</italic><sub>2</sub> = 2<italic>R</italic>⁄3) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>, Supplementary Fig. 2A). From this result, we can conclude that from the viewpoint of one of the two asters, the periphery of the second aster cannot be viewed as a hard mechanical object. In other words, the steady state force generation associated with an aster being a distance <italic>x</italic> away from the periphery of the second aster is lower than the force generated between the same aster and the explant boundary at distance <italic>x</italic>.</p>

<p>Given the above observation, we predicted that the dynamics between aster pairs will differ from the single aster dynamics. Using live imaging, we tracked the dynamics and separation of aster doublets. The velocity profile of the doublets is distinct from the single aster case (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>, Supplementary Fig. 2B). We noticed that the peak separation velocity was always near half the final aster separation distance (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>), independent of final separation distance. This suggests that the resulting magnitude of the forces are similar in the initial phase of separation and the eventual reaching of the equilibrium position.</p>
<p>Given this eccentric movement of two asters, the aster separation could be driven by overlap and sliding of astral microtubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Baker et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Deshpande et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Lv et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Vukušić et al., 2021</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">2017</xref>), or by mutual contact leading to repulsion by microtubules of both asters. Thus, we quantified the microtubule intensity between the separating asters (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>, left) and generated kymographs of the microtubule fluorescence intensity along the separation axis (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>, right). The intensity at half the separation distance decayed exponentially (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>), consistent with models of dynamic microtubule length distribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Howard, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Jeune-Smith and Hess, 2010</xref>). When aster separation ceased there was almost no detectable microtubule signal between the asters.</p>
<p>For a viscous material, the velocity, <italic>ν</italic>, of a submerged object depends on the applied force <italic>F</italic>: <italic>ν</italic> ≈ <italic>γF</italic>, where <italic>γ</italic> is the effective viscous drag coefficient. Naïvely interpreting the microtubule distribution as the resulting force profile does not match with the observed separation velocity profile. However, multiplying the microtubule distribution by a short-ranged inhibitory term, <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="535028v2_inline1.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula>, results in an excellent fit to our observed aster separation velocities (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E</xref>). The nature of such a short-ranged inhibition in the action of microtubules is expanded on in the Discussion.</p>
<p>Overall, we see that aster-aster and aster-boundary dynamics both appear to involve repulsive interactions with a degree of inhibition at very short distances. The difference in the apparent steady-state positioning of aster pairs suggests that aster-aster interactions are weaker than those between the asters and the boundary. The two asters may mechanically interact via crosslinking of microtubule overlaps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bieling et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Deshpande et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Lv et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Subramanian et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Wijeratne and Subramanian, 2018</xref>), while astral microtubules may simply hit against the boundary interface, which acts as an immovable hard wall. However, we note that this conclusion is based on inference from the aster positions; we have not been able to quantitatively test this observation.</p>

<title>Perturbations of aster interaction are consistent with a microtubule-mediated repulsive force potential</title>
<p>To further explore the nature of microtubule aster interaction, we performed a series of inhibitory treatments to chemically perturb the interaction. Since small-molecule inhibitors for candidate molecular motors have no effect in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Firestone et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Maliga et al., 2002</xref>), we targeted microtubules and ATPases in general. We generated explants with two asters during separation and pulse-injected a defined volume of 200 µM colchicine, which causes acute depolymerization of microtubules. Upon injection the asters stopped separating and sometimes inverted their direction of motion (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>, Video 2, right). We then tested whether ATP dependent molecular machinery was the sole process leading to aster repulsion, by inhibiting ATP consumption with sodium azide. We injected a series of concentrations of sodium azide into explants that contained a separating pair of asters (Video 2, middle). Adding sodium azide decreased the initial recoil velocity (dashed lines in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>) and resulted in a considerable reduction in aster separation distance. However, even at very high concentrations of sodium azide, we still observed residual motion, suggesting that both ATP driven microtubule-mediated separation and passively driven separation, <italic>e.g</italic>., through entropy minimization, occur here.</p>

<p>Both effective pushing or pulling forces can cause aster separation and centering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Grill et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Laan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Zhu et al., 2010</xref>). Though our above results appear more consistent with effective pushing forces, this is based on analysis of the aster dynamics and the aster positioning within the explant; <italic>i.e.,</italic> we have not directly tested the nature of the effective force. Pulling within the cytoplasm requires aster asymmetry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Kimura and Kimura, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Tanimoto et al., 2016</xref>). Thus, we performed targeted UV photo-ablation experiments in larger explants and generated ellipse-shaped ablations positioned asymmetrically around one steady state aster, affecting microtubules on the left side more than on the right side of the aster (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>). If pulling on the boundary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Grill et al., 2003</xref>) or hydrodynamic effects from vesicle transport along microtubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Tanimoto et al., 2016</xref>) drives aster motion, we expect a displacement to the right (positive) after ablation. Conversely, if the net force applied on microtubules favors pushing on the MTOC, we expect a displacement to the left (negative). Indeed, asters consistently moved to the left, supporting a dominating effect of microtubule-driven pushing (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>, Video 3). As a control, we performed the same perturbation in explants that were injected with the microtubule inhibitor colchicine (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref>). Under this condition, asters moved very slowly to the right (positive), which is consistent with a weak hydrodynamic effect from other contractile sources (<italic>e.g.,</italic> actomyosin) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Keren, 2016</xref>). We conclude that a single aster moves and positions within <italic>Drosophila</italic> explants by microtubule-dependent pushing force.</p>
<p>To challenge these conclusions, we performed two types of UV ablation in explants containing two asters (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E</xref>): 1) light pulses emitted along an ellipse around both asters, while they separate, to destroy microtubules in the periphery; 2) light pulses emitted along a line between the two asters, either in steady state or while separating, to destroy microtubules between asters. If forces are attractive, then ablation type 1 will stop separation while ablation type 2 will lead to an acceleration. If forces are repulsive, we predict the opposite response. We found a slight acceleration for peripheral ablation (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4F</xref> type 1 and Video 4) and a strong deceleration or movement inversion with subsequent recovery for central ablation (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4F</xref>, type 2). Separation recovered likely because of fast re-growth of microtubules after ablation (in the range of µm/min) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Rogers et al., 2002</xref>). In summary, the dynamic behavior of asters in our explants is consistent with a model of radially symmetric microtubule-based repulsion.</p>

<title>Simple repulsive model of aster interactions can replicate the observed aster behavior ex vivo</title>
<p>We formulated a physical model of aster repulsion from our experimental insights.

<p>We tested whether this 2D model could replicate the observed dynamics and positioning in the one-aster case. The model reproduced the dynamics of a single aster moving away from the boundary (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>). Likewise, we can solve the 1D equation of motion stochastically for the one-aster case (Methods); the final aster position scaled with droplet size up to around 50μm (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>).</p>
<p>We next introduced a second aster into the 2D model. We had to account for interactions between aster-boundary and aster-aster. The two-aster scenario was defined by allowing a single aster to divide, then following the positions of each sister aster. We can reproduce the experimentally observed aster dynamics, with a more symmetric speed profile as compared with the one-aster case (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D</xref>). Again, solving the equivalent 1D equation of motion stochastically, we found that this provides a good approximation of the aster positions (compare <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5E</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5F</xref>).</p>
<p>Our model closely matches experimental observations in one- and two-aster scenarios. What about systems with greater than two asters? We previously showed that multi-aster samples form symmetric structures, <italic>e.g.,</italic> equilateral triangles with three asters and square-like distributions with four asters (de-Carvalho et al., 2022). Can our model replicate these observations? We ran our dynamic simulations with three of four initial asters randomly placed, until the asters reached equilibrium positions. In the three-aster scenario, most simulations resulted in the asters distributed such that they (approximately) formed the vertices of an equilibrium triangle. Subsequently, the asters were distributed with angle 60° between each other (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5G</xref>). Likewise, most four-aster simulations resulted in the asters (approximately) forming the vertices of a square, with angle distribution 90° (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5H</xref>). These results are similar to those observed experimentally (de-Carvalho et al., 2022). Consistent with experiment, in a small subset of simulations the four asters formed a triangle with the fourth aster positioned away from the other three (upper right inset, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5H</xref>). In conclusion, our simple repulsive model can reproduce both the observed equilibrium aster distributions and the quantified aster dynamics in a range of scenarios.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We have characterized the mechanics of microtubule aster positioning using an <italic>ex vivo</italic> model of the cellular context where, naturally, hundreds of these cytoskeletal structures co-exist and define the regular positioning of nuclei in a multinucleated cell. We generated single embryo explants from mutant <italic>Drosophila</italic> syncytial embryos in which mitosis is inhibited but centrosomes duplicate and divide, each giving rise to a radial microtubule array. This experimental reductionist approach of generating a proliferative aster system <italic>ex vivo</italic> has several advantages (de-Carvalho et al., 2022). First and foremost, it enables the study of the mechanics of single aster positioning (the “atomic” structure) under boundary conditions, and the canonical interaction between two structures. Our experiments support a mechanical model where asters generate a radially symmetric, repulsive force potential. Given the positioning of asters relative to each other and to the boundary, we posit that the repulsive interaction towards the boundary is about twice as strong as compared to the repulsion between two asters. However, we note that we have been unable to directly measure this force. The range of action between asters is finite and productive for positioning only up to ∼35 µm. We note that two asters positioned close (&lt;3 µm) to each other, for example after centrosome disengagement, show dynamics of weak attraction. We highlight that, by design, our experiments in embryo explants resolve the canonical aster–aster interaction whereas additional cell cortex interactions and more complex boundary conditions imposed by the cell membrane may occur in the intact embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Foe et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Postner et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Winkler et al., 2015</xref>).</p>
<p>There has been substantial discussion over the nature of aster force potentials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Garzon-Coral et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Meaders et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Minc et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Mitchison et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Pelletier et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Sulerud et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Tanimoto et al., 2018</xref>): are they repulsive or attractive; what range do they act over; and are there different regimes of action depending on temporal or spatial constraints? Here, we show that asters derived from the syncytial embryo of <italic>Drosophila</italic> display a short-range repulsive potential. At very short distances, this potential tends to zero (or arguably even attractive), likely due to microtubules being unable to form linearly. A simple model can replicate our observations without requiring additional assumptions. It is worth noting that the length scales here (typically 3–10 μm between asters in the embryo) are substantially smaller than those in other model systems used to explore aster dynamics, such as the sea urchin (&gt;50 μm, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Tanimoto et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Meaders et al. 2020</xref>). In that system, effective pulling forces generated by hydrodynamic processes dominate the aster positioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Tanimoto et al., 2018</xref>).</p>
<p>What is the mechanism underlying the reduction in microtubule-mediated force at very short distances, both for aster-aster and aster-boundary interactions? We observed splay in the microtubule distribution near the boundary. If microtubules are generating a mechanical pushing force (<italic>i.e.,</italic> like a rod being pushed against a wall), such splay would be expected. Microtubule polymerization at a boundary generates forces against the boundary in the range that can lead to buckling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Holy et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Howard, 2001</xref>). Conversely, it is challenging to reconcile this observation with astral microtubules (and linker proteins) transmitting a local pulling force (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Grill et al., 2003</xref>). However, when two asters are very close, there may occur molecular crosslinking both between microtubules orientated (anti-) parallel- and perpendicular-to their axis of separation. Crosslinking between the perpendicular orientated microtubules at the periphery could act to generate a local pulling force between the asters at very short distances. As asters separate, sliding of antiparallel orientated microtubules will dominate, driving further aster separation. To test this hypothesis, super resolution microscopy may be necessary to gain sufficient spatial resolution to distinguish the relative population of parallel and perpendicular aligned microtubule bundles.</p>
<p>Between two asters, force inhibition may be attributed to molecular friction between microtubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Forth et al., 2014</xref>). Single molecule experiments showed that antiparallel microtubule crosslinking, and their sliding by molecular motor activity or entropic effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Lansky et al., 2015</xref>), results in viscoelastic properties of the microtubule pair as a mechanical element (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Shimamoto et al., 2015</xref>). At the level of two asters, hundreds of such elements in parallel accumulate to a “softened” repulsion, overcoming any opposing forces on each aster (boundary constraints, viscosity of cytoplasm), leading to aster separation.</p>
<p>We emphasize that the molecular mechanism underlying the generation of the pushing forces remains unclear, in part due to the lack of suitable reagents for targeted perturbation of molecular motors in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. However, our finding that aster separation occurs despite inhibition of ATPases (<italic>e.g.</italic>, motors) is both interesting and intriguing. It is unlikely due to mutual contact between microtubules growing from opposite asters since the probability for such encounters to happen and to be mechanically effective is extremely low. In our view, this “passive” repulsion force is likely caused by entropy driven microtubule sliding by ATP independent crosslinkers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Forth et al., 2014</xref>). If possible, targeted inhibition of candidate microtubule associated proteins should give further insight.</p>

<title>Pharmacological perturbation of embryo explants</title>
<p>Pharmacological perturbations were performed by adding different drugs (colchicine at 0.2 mM, sodium azide at 0.5, 10, or 100 mM) diluted in cytoplasm-compatible buffer (50 mM HEPES, pH 7.8, 100 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl2). Solutions were directly administrated to the explants using a fine pipette (pulled using a Narishige PC-100 Puller with a: 2-step (69% + 55%) heating protocol and with 4 mm drop length) connected to an Eppendorf FemtoJet® 4i pump. The final drug dilution in the explants was approximately 1:10 (solution:cytosol). Buffer injections were conducted as control.</p>

<title>Laser ablation system</title>
<p>The laser ablation system was implemented by I.A.T. on the confocal spinning-disk microscope described above. A Crylas FTSS-355-Q pulsed laser emitting 355 nm, 1.1 ns pulses, 15µJ pulse energy at 1 KHz was aligned with a beam expander (16x), a scan head (SCANcube 7, Scanlab, Germany) coupled to an f-theta lens (f=56 mm, anti-reflection coating for 340–370 nm, SCANLAB AG, Germany). The focus point of the f-theta lens was aligned to be parfocal to the focal plane of the objective, using a tube lens (f=200 mm, Ø=30 mm, 355 nm AR coated, OWIS, Germany) and a dichroic mirror (T387 DCLP, Chroma) in the upper stage filter wheel. Any scattered light was blocked at the emission side with a RazorEdge LP 355 dichroic mirror OD6 @ 355nm (Chroma). The system was controlled with homemade journals for Metamorph software (Molecular Devices Inc.). The optimal laser power was set to ensure microtubule ablation while avoiding thermal expansion of cytoplasm, with post-ablation microtubule signal recovery matching known polymerization dynamics. This combination of conditions proved to be efficient at ablating target structures beyond fluorophore bleaching. In explants containing a single aster, astral microtubules were asymmetrically ablated by positioning an ellipsoid off-center (21.7 by 10.8 µm, 4 times, 15 s interval, 0.54 µm step, laser power: 25%) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>). In explants containing two asters, astral microtubules were ablated using an ellipsoid (21.7 by 10.8 µm, 3 times, 15 s interval, 0.54 µm step, laser power: 10–15%) roughly centered at the mid-point between the two asters, while interpolar microtubules were ablated using linear ablations (21.7 µm, 3 times, 15 s interval 0.54 µm step, laser power: 10–15%) perpendicular to the axis connecting the asters (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4F</xref>).</p>

<title>Two-dimensional dynamic model of aster interactions</title>
<p>The cytoplasm is viscous. For a viscous material, the velocity, <italic>ν</italic>, of an object is dependent on the applied force <italic>F</italic>: <italic>ν</italic> ≈ <italic>γF</italic>, where <italic>γ</italic> is the effective viscous drag coefficient. In our simple dynamic model implemented in Matlab<sup>®</sup> we consider <italic>γ</italic> = 1 and isolated asters with a circularly-symmetric force potential described by <italic>f</italic>(<italic>r</italic>) = <italic>f<sub>slip</sub></italic> (<italic>r</italic>) × <italic>ρ<sub>MT</sub></italic> (<italic>r</italic>), where <italic>r</italic> is the distance from the aster center (centrosome), <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="535028v2_inline6.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> and <italic>ρ</italic><sub>MT</sub>(<italic>r</italic>) represents the distribution of microtubules from the aster. We incorporate <italic>f<sub>slip</sub></italic> to account for the reduced apparent microtubule force generation at short distances. For simplicity, we take the same characteristic distance <italic>x</italic><sub>0</sub> for both aster-boundary and aster-aster interaction. To account for boundary conditions, we introduce a mirror charge outside the circle for each aster. We solve <italic>ν</italic> ≈ <italic>γF</italic> by the Euler method in MATLAB<sup>®</sup> (the equations are not highly non-linear so this approach works well and is fast).</p>
<p>For single asters, we only consider interactions between the wall and aster. We take <italic>ρ</italic><sub>MT</sub>(<italic>r</italic>) = <italic>e</italic><sup>−<italic>r</italic>/<italic>λ</italic></sup>, with <italic>λ</italic> = 15<italic>μm</italic> and <italic>f</italic><sub>0</sub> = 0.007 and <italic>r</italic> is the perpendicular aster-wall separation. We also include a ‘noise’ term, <italic>δf</italic> = 0.0005. So, <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="535028v2_inline7.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> where <italic>r̂</italic> is the unit vector between aster and wall, and <italic>r̂<sub>ran</sub></italic> is a random unit vector generated at each time iteration. For two asters, the force is given by <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="535028v2_inline8.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> where <italic>x</italic> is the distance between the two asters and <italic>x̂</italic> unit vector between them. <italic>f<sub>aster</sub></italic><sub>−<italic>wall</italic></sub>(<italic>r</italic>) is the same as for the one aster scenario. We take <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="535028v2_inline9.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> and <italic>λ<sub>aster</sub></italic> = 12 <italic>μm</italic>.</p>
<p>Considering the aster-aster separation, we assumed the aster pair initially separated by 2 μm and centered within the <italic>in silico</italic> explant space. For the single aster case, we initialized the aster 1μm from the boundary. We always considered a system of radius 40μm.

<title>Analysis of free asters in explants – distance distributions</title>
<p>Distance between asters and from aster to the boundary were obtained in explants at steady state,</p>
<p><italic>i.e.</italic> where asters did not move anymore (usually 30–45 min after explant deposition). The inter-aster distance was determined as Euclidean distance in 3D. We defined the <italic>boundary distance</italic> (<italic>b</italic>, <italic>b</italic><sub>1</sub>, <italic>b</italic><sub>2</sub>) as the shortest distance from the aster to the interface between glass, oil and cytosol, determined manually using the FIJI measurement tools (at a precision of ±0.5 µm). To determine the explant boundary on the glass (approximated with a circle of radius <italic>R</italic>), maximum intensity projections of both fluorescence emission channels was assessed to trace the interface between the glass, oil and cytosol. For larger explants with high aspect ratio – a quasi-2D situation – the definition of <italic>boundary distance</italic> served as good approximation for a boundary in two dimensions. However, in small explants where the aspect ratio is not as high, two asters sometimes aligned considerably in the third dimension. In these cases, the definition for <italic>boundary distance</italic> led to an underestimation of the maximum projected inter-aster distance <italic>M</italic> = 2<italic>R</italic> − <italic>b</italic><sub>1</sub> − <italic>b</italic><sub>2</sub>; it becomes a geometric problem in 3D and the longest dimension is not necessarily in the plane of the glass-explant interface. This is evident for some data points in small explants (yellow dots in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5E</xref>).</p>

<title>Analysis of free asters in explants – dynamics</title>
<p>The coordinates of free asters were obtained by applying a Gaussian blur filter (radius: 1–2 pixels) and using the plugin TrackMate v3.5.1 of FIJI ImageJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Schindelin et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Tinevez et al., 2017</xref>). The coordinates of detected spots were imported into MATLAB<sup>®</sup> for assignment and distance calculation similarly as mentioned above. The instant relative velocity was calculated using the formula: <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="535028v2_inline10.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula>, where <italic>d</italic> is the 3D Euclidian distance and <italic>t</italic> is time in the flanking time points of the measure point. For unperturbed experiments, data was normalized to the maximum distance achieved in the separated phase to correct for scaling effect during splitting dynamics (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1G</xref>).</p>
<p>To analyze the lipid droplets, we performed a similar analysis using FIJI TrackMateJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Schindelin et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Tinevez et al., 2017</xref>). Seven extracts were analyzed with an aster present, with over 100 individual tracks of lipid droplets. Mean-squared-displacement (MSD) was then extracted across the entire time course of imaging. Similar analysis was performed in extracts without an aster. Curves (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>) were fitted using the ‘fit’ function in MATLAB<sup>®</sup>. Fitting the general function <italic>a</italic> ⋅ <italic>t</italic><sup><italic>c</italic></sup> gives a best fit for <italic>c</italic> = 1.3±0.1 and 1.5±0.1 for the one aster and no aster data respectively.</p>
<p>To calculate the exclusion size around each aster as it moves through the explant, we considered asters when they were 15 μm from the boundary edge. At this point, the distance to the nearest lipid droplet was measured in FIJI from seven explants. Further, we generated four random coordinates within each explant using Matlab and measured the distance to the nearest droplet from that random coordinate (in situations where the random position overlapped with a droplet, a new position was randomly generated), giving 28 random locations sampled across seven explants. <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref> shows that the exclusion zone around an aster is significantly larger than the likely separation given the random location of droplets. Statistical analysis performed using estimationstats.com.</p>

<title>Microtubule profile quantification</title>
<p>For single asters (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F</xref>), we quantified the microtubule intensity using the intensity of the RFP::β-Tubulin signal. Taking the point when asters were either 5 μm or 20 μm from the explant boundary, we used FIJI to measure the microtubule intensity along a 10 μm straight line from the edge and through the aster. The line had a width of 2 μm. For each experiment, we normalized the total intensity by the maximum measured value and then binned the data in 0.2 μm bins. Hence, the recorded intensity does not reach one, and the mean intensity only reaches a maximum around 0.8 as the maximum value does not occur at the same position. Similar analysis was performed for the scenario with two asters (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>). In this case, the centroids of the asters were used to define a straight line along which the microtubule intensity was measured throughout the process of aster separation. From this straight line between the asters, we also generated the kymograph shown in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref> right.</p>

<title>Analysis of free asters in explants – perturbations with drugs and UV ablation</title>
<p>For comparison between control and perturbation experiments, data was time-aligned to the perturbation time-point (t = 0) and plotted as average ± s.d. from at least three replicates for each condition. The change of inter-aster distance during the first 3 s after drug injection was estimated by linear regression assuming normally distributed noise, and the confidence interval of the estimated slope served as test statistic for differences between control and perturbation. Differences in final, steady-state inter-aster distance were tested by comparing the pools of distances from the last 3 s (=12 frames), using Wilcoxon signed-rank test. A significance level of 0.05 was defined prior to testing. In the case of UV ablations, the position of the aster five frames before ablation was defined as coordinate origin. The two main axes of the ellipsoid, along which the pulsed ablation was performed, defined the cartesian coordinate system. A displacement vector of the current aster position relative to the origin was calculated for each time point. The mean and standard deviation of axial (Δx) and lateral (Δy) displacement was plotted in time (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C–D</xref>).</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
This paper addresses the mechanisms positioning microtubule asters in Drosophila explants. Taking advantage of a genetic mutant, blocking the cell cycle in early embryos, the authors generate embryos with centrosomes detached from nuclei and then study the positioning mechanisms of such asters in explants. They conclude that asters interact via pushing forces. While this is an artificial system, understanding the mechanics of asters positioning, in particular, whether forces are pushing or pulling is an important one.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
The major strength of this paper is the series of laser cutting experiments supporting that asters position via pushing forces acting both on the boundary (see below for a relevant comment) and between asters. The combination of imaging, data analysis and mathematical modeling is also powerful.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
This paper has weaknesses, mainly in the presentation but also in the quality of the data which do not always support the conclusions satisfactorily (this might in part be a presentation issue).</p>
<p>In Figure 2, it is difficult for me to understand what is being tracked. I believe that the authors track the yolk granules (visible as large green blobs) and not lipid droplets. There is some confusion between the text, legends and methods so I could not tell. If the authors are tracking yolk granules as a proxy for hydrodynamics flows it seems appropriate to cite previous papers that have used and verified these methods. More notably, this figure is somewhat disconnected with the rest of the paper. I find the analysis interesting in principle but would urge the authors to propose some interpretation of the experiments in the context of their big-picture message. At this point, I cannot understand what the Figure adds.</p>
<p>In Figure 3, it is not surprising that the aster-aster interactions are different from interactions with the boundary which is likely more rigid. It is also hard to understand why the force and thus velocity should scale as microtubule length. This Figure should be better conceptualized. I think that it becomes clear at the end of the paper that the authors are trying to derive an effective potential to use in a mathematical model in Figure 5 to test their hypotheses. I think that should be told from the start, so a reader understands why these experiments are being shown.</p>
<p>The experiments in Figure 4 are very nice in supporting a pushing model. However, it would help if the authors could speculate what the single aster is pushing against in this experiment. The experiments reported in Figure 1 seemed to suggest that the aster mainly pushed against the boundary. In the experiments in Figure 4 do the individual asters touch the boundary on both sides? I think that readers need more information on what the extract looks like for those experiments.</p>
<p>Figure 4F could use some statistics. I doubt that the acceleration in the pink curves would be significant. I believe that the deceleration is and that is probably the most crucial result. Since the authors present only 3 asters pairs it is important to be sure that these conclusions are solid.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
The aster, consisting of microtubules, plays important roles in spindle positioning and the determination of the cleavage site in animals. The mechanics of aster movement and positioning have been extensively studied in several cell types. However, there is no unified biophysical model, as different mechanisms appear to predominate in different model systems. In the present manuscript, the authors studied aster positioning mechanics in the Drosophila syncytial embryo, in which short-ranged aster repulsion generates a separation force. Taking advantage of the ex vivo system developed by the group and the fly gnu mutant, in which the nuclear number can be minimized, the authors performed time-lapse observations of single asters and multiple asters in the explant. The observed aster dynamics were interpreted by building a mathematical model dealing with forces. They found that aster dissociation from the boundary depends on the microtubule pushing force. Additionally, laser ablation targeting two separating asters showed that aster-aster separation is also mediated by the microtubule pushing force. Furthermore, they built a simulation model based on the experimental results, which reproduced aster movement in the explant under various conditions. Notably, the actual aster dynamics were best reproduced in the model by including a short-ranged inhibitory term when asters are close to the boundary or each other.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
This study reveals a unique aster positioning mechanics in the syncytial embryo explant, which leads to an understanding of the mechanism underlying the positioning of multiple asters associated with nuclei in the embryo. The use of explants enabled accurate measurement of aster motility and, therefore, the construction of a quantitative model. This is a notable achievement.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
The main conclusion that aster repulsion predominates in this system has already been drawn by the same authors in their recent study (de-Carvalho et al., Development, 2022). As the present work provides additional support to the previous study using different experimental system, the authors should emphasize that the present manuscripts adds to it (but the conceptual novelty is limited). The molecular mechanisms underlying aster repulsion remain unexplored since the authors were unable to identify specific factor(s) responsible for aster repulsion in the explant.</p>
<p>Specific suggestions:</p>
<p>
Microtubules should be visualized more clearly (either in live or fixed samples). This is particularly important in Figure 4E and Video 4 (laser ablation experiment to create asymmetric asters).</p>
