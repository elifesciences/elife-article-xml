<title>Abstract</title>
<sec>
<title>Background</title>
<p>Deficient Anterior pituitary with common Variable Immune Deficiency (DAVID) syndrome, combining adrenocorticotropic hormone deficiency (ACTHD) and primary hypogammaglobulinemia, is caused by <italic>NFKB2</italic> heterozygous mutations. Nuclear factor kappa B (NFKB) signaling is a key regulator of the immune system; however, the underlying mechanism of its association with endocrine symptoms remains unknown. The role of NFKB2 in the development of the human pituitary was called into question by <italic>Nfkb2</italic>-deficient <italic>Lym1</italic> mice, which have normal pituitary functions.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Purpose</title>
<p>The aim of this study was to create a human disease model to define the role of <italic>NFKB2</italic> in human pituitary development.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Methods</title>
<p>We established pituitary organoids in three-dimensional (3D) culture after directed differentiation from CRISPR/Cas9-edited human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC). First, we conducted a proof-of-concept study, introducing a homozygous <italic>TBX19<sup>K146R/K146R</sup></italic> missense pathogenic variant in hiPSC, an allele found in patients with congenital isolated ACTHD. We then used the same method to produce <italic>NFKB2<sup>D865G/D865G</sup></italic> mutant organoids, harboring the pathogenic missense variant previously identified in DAVID patients. This mutation causes a failure of NFKB2 p100 phosphorylation that blocks processing to form active NFKB2 p52. We further characterized pituitary organoid development with bulk RNA sequencing and validated findings with quantitative RT-PCR and by immunofluorescence in section and whole organoids.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Results</title>
<p>Analysis of wild-type (WT) organoids demonstrated that this <italic>in vitro</italic> model recapitulates corticotroph cell differentiation. <italic>TBX19<sup>K146R/K146R</sup></italic> organoids conserved early expression of <italic>HESX1</italic>, but had significantly decreased <italic>PITX1</italic>, <italic>TBX19</italic>, <italic>LHX3,</italic> and <italic>POMC</italic> transcription<italic>. NFKB2<sup>D865G/D865G</sup></italic> organoids also had dramatically reduced corticotrophs. Furthermore, <italic>NFKB2<sup>D865G/D865G</sup></italic> significantly perturbs the expression of 67 genes known to contribute to pituitary development, among which 39 transcription factors. Differential expression was found for several growth factor genes or genes associated with the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and terminal endocrine differentiation.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>We used a combination of CRISPR/Cas9 editing and refinement of a 3D organoid culture protocol to model human ACTHD due to <italic>TBX19</italic> or <italic>NFKB2</italic> mutations. The <italic>NFKB2</italic> variant studied induced a significant decrease in corticotroph differentiation, confirming the causative role of NFKB2 in isolated or syndromic ACTHD and demonstrating for the first time a direct functional role of NFKB2 in human pituitary development.</p>

<title>Summary of Updates:</title>
<fn fn-type="update"><p>In the new version of the manuscript, we analyzed more samples from the same experiments. RNA-seq results have been examined in more details with particular focus on the possible mechanisms leading to the pathogenicity of the NFKB2 mutation (growth factors, epithelial to mesenchymal transition, terminal differentiation), as well as its impact of non-corticotrope lineages.
We have now provided several additional figures derived from these analyses, including a synthetic figure to summarize the most relevant observed effect

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Adrenocorticotropic hormone deficiency (ACTHD) is defined by an insufficient production of ACTH by the pituitary, and then low adrenal cortisol production. Proper diagnosis and management of ACTHD is crucial as it is a life-threatening condition in the neonatal period characterized by hypoglycemia, cholestatic jaundice and seizures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. Constitutional ACTHD, i.e, ACTHD diagnosed at birth or during the first years of life, can be isolated or associated with other pituitary hormone deficiencies, such as growth hormone (GH) or thyrotropin-stimulating hormone (TSH), then as part of combined pituitary hormone deficiency (CPHD). ACTHD can be due to mutations in genes coding for transcription factors responsible for pituitary ontogenesis, especially the T-box transcription factor <italic>TBX19</italic> (also known as <italic>TPIT</italic>), <italic>NFKB2, LHX3, LHX4, PROP1, HESX1, SOX2, SOX3, OTX2 and FGF8</italic>.</p>
<p>Mutations of <italic>TBX19</italic> account for approximately two-thirds of neonatal-onset complete isolated ACTHD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. TBX19 is a T-box transcription factor restricted to pituitary pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC)-expressing cells in mice and humans. It is essential for <italic>POMC</italic> gene transcription and terminal differentiation of POMC-expressing cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. POMC is the precursor of ACTH. <italic>Tbx19</italic> -deficient mice have only a few pituitary <italic>Pomc</italic>-expressing cells, with very low ACTH and undetectable corticosterone levels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. In humans with isolated ACTH deficiency, <italic>TBX19</italic> mutations lead to loss-of-function by different mechanisms, such as the <italic>K146R</italic> (exon 2, c.437 A&gt;G) pathogenic variant located in the T-box region, which results in a loss of DNA-binding ability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Thanks to GENHYPOPIT<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>, an international network aimed at identifying new genetic etiologies of combined pituitary hormone deficiency, we described the first cases of DAVID (Deficient Anterior pituitary with common Variable Immune Deficiency) syndrome, a rare association of hypopituitarism (mainly ACTHD) and immune deficiency (hypogammaglobulinemia) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. DAVID syndrome is associated with variants in the nuclear factor kappa-B subunit 2 (<italic>NFKB2</italic>) gene<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>. In particular, we reported that a pathogenic, heterozygous D865G (exon 23, c.2594 A&gt;G) <italic>NFKB2</italic> variant was found in a patient presenting with severe recurrent infections from 2 years of age, who at the age of 5 was diagnosed with ACTHD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. Mutations in the C-terminal region of NFKB2 lead to the disruption of both non-canonical and canonical pathways<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. Full-length NFKB2 (p100) protein has 2 critical serines, S866 and S870, in the C-terminal domain. Phosphorylation of these sites yields the transcriptionally active NFKB2 (p52) through proteasomal processing of p100 protein. The D865G mutation, located adjacent to the critical S866 phosphorylation site, protects mutant protein from proteasomal degradation, causes defective processing of p100 to p52, and results in reduced translocation of p52 to the nucleus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. <italic>NFKB2<sup>+/D865G</sup></italic> resulted in 50% of normal processing to p52, whereas <italic>NFKB2<sup>D865G/D865G</sup></italic> exhibited near-absence of p52<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. The nuclear factor kappa B (NFKB) signaling pathway is a known key regulator of the immune system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>, which likely explains the immune phenotype of patients with DAVID syndrome, including susceptibility to infections and auto-immune disorders<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. In contrast, the underlying mechanism causing pituitary disorders remains unknown, with two predominating hypotheses: an indirect autoimmune hypophysitis, preferentially affecting corticotroph function, or a primary developmental defect suggested by the expression of <italic>NFKB2</italic> in the developing human pituitary<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. However, a developmental role for <italic>NFKB2</italic> was not confirmed in the mouse: the <italic>Lym1</italic> mouse model carrying a homozygous nonsense variant Y868* presented an apparently normal pituitary development and function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Over the last years, human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived organoids have emerged as promising models to study many developmental mechanisms and their perturbation in disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. Pioneering work on human embryonic stem cells and later, hiPSC, has established that 3D organoid models can replicate aspects of pituitary development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>, and could thus be of major interest in modeling pituitary disorders<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>. In the present study, we applied recent progress in genome editing using CRISPR/Cas9<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup> to a refined protocol to derive 3D organoids from hiPSC in order to model ACTHD. We validated the recapitulation of corticotroph cell differentiation <italic>in vitro</italic> by introducing a <italic>TBX19</italic> mutation known to induce isolated human ACTHD and documenting the subsequent deficiencies in corticotroph development. When our model was used to characterize the D865G <italic>NFKB2</italic> variant found in patients with DAVID syndrome, it displayed dramatically altered corticotroph differentiation in the absence of immune cells, clearly demonstrating for the first time a direct role of <italic>NFKB2</italic> in human pituitary development.</p>

<title>Preparation of the CRISPR/Cas9 sgRNA plasmid</title>
<p>For each targeted gene, sgRNA plasmid was prepared as previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>. Briefly, we designed a sgRNA sequence within 20 nucleotides from the target site selected with the open-source CRISPOR tool (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://crispor.tefor.net/">http://crispor.tefor.net/</ext-link>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>The sgRNA sequence used to generate <italic>TBX19<sup>K146R</sup></italic> was (5’&gt;3’): AAGCTGACCAACAAGCTCAA (see also Table S2).</p>

<p>We used the cAB03 (also known as pX459-pEF1alpha) vector as previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>. Briefly, pSpCas9 (BB)-2A-Puro (PX459) V2.0 (Addgene plasmid # 62988, Addgene, Teddington, UK) was modified by the EF1 alpha promoter<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>.

<p>We also designed donor sequences to generate <italic>TBX19<sup>K146R</sup></italic> and <italic>NFKB2<sup>D865G</sup></italic> missense mutations. A donor sequence is used for homology-directed repair, allowing the introduction (“knock-in”, KI) of single nucleotide variations, with low efficiency. To optimize the efficiency of KI editing, the donor sequences were designed as single-stranded oligo DNA nucleotides (ssODN), carrying the mutation of interest, and also included a silent (or blocking) mutation that mutates the protospacer-adjacent motif (PAM) or disrupts the sgRNA binding region to prevent re-cutting by Cas9 after successful editing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>.

<p>Successful differentiation was validated in WT organoids by qRT-PCR, at early stages by the expression of a set of pituitary transcription factors, including <italic>HESX1</italic>, <italic>PITX1</italic> and <italic>LHX3</italic>, and at the latest stage of corticotroph cell differentiation by the expression of <italic>TBX19</italic> and <italic>POMC</italic> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2A</xref>, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2C</xref>-<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2H</xref>). HESX1 is the first specific marker of pituitary primordium and its expression is important for the early determination of the gland. In WT organoids, <italic>HESX1</italic> peaked around day 6 of culture, and was rapidly downregulated from day 18 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>). Expression of <italic>PITX1</italic> (oral ectoderm marker) and <italic>LHX3</italic> (pituitary progenitor marker) increased from day 27, then <italic>PITX1</italic> reached a plateau from d48 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>) whereas <italic>LHX3</italic> peaked at d75 and was then slightly downregulated (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>). Immunofluorescence confirmed the presence of oral ectoderm cells expressing PITX1 and CDH1 (E-cadherin, <bold>Suppl Figure S3C</bold>), therefore resembling Rathke’s pouch progenitors. The effective generation of pituitary progenitors was confirmed by the presence of LHX3+ cells in WT organoids on day 48 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref><bold>, Suppl Figure S3A</bold>). These cells were located in the outermost layer of WT organoids, surrounding the hypothalamic progenitor layer that expressed NKX2.1 (<bold>Suppl Figure S3B</bold>). By day 105, WT organoids contained many differentiated corticotrophs co-expressing TBX19 protein in the nucleus and ACTH in the cytoplasm, as seen in confocal microscopy, a critical feature for the rest of our investigations (n=8, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref><bold>, Suppl Figure S3D</bold>).

<p>We then tested whether ACTHD could be modeled by <italic>TBX19</italic> -mutant pituitary organoids. To this end, the development of pituitary organoids carrying <italic>TBX19</italic> KI was matched to WT organoid development and analyzed using qRT-PCR and immunofluorescence for pituitary ontogenesis markers as described above. Our data showed a significant decrease in the expression of <italic>HESX1</italic> at d18 and d27 in the mutant (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>). Both <italic>PITX1</italic> and <italic>LHX3</italic> transcript levels were significantly decreased by day 48 and day 75 in mutant organoids (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref><bold> and </bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2F</xref>), with only partial recovery for <italic>PITX1</italic> by d105, suggesting an impairment of pituitary progenitor generation. Although <italic>TBX19</italic> transcript levels were unchanged until d75 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2G</xref>), we observed a decrease in <italic>POMC</italic> expression in the <italic>TBX19</italic> KI organoids that was significant from day 48 onwards (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2H</xref>). <italic>TBX19</italic> expression was significantly higher in mutant organoids at d105, but this had no influence on <italic>POMC</italic> expression, which remained very low. These results confirmed that our organoid model can recapitulate the need for a fully functional TBX19 protein to achieve proper <italic>POMC</italic> gene transcription during human pituitary development.</p>
<p>Next, we checked several pituitary markers by immunofluorescence (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3A</xref>-<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3D</xref>). In line with qRT-PCR results, <italic>TBX19</italic> KI organoid immunostaining on day 48 showed that LHX3 protein expression was decreased in <italic>TBX19</italic> KI organoids (n= 10 organoids for each group, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3A</xref>, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3B</xref>). By day 105, we observed that there were significantly fewer corticotroph cells expressing ACTH and TBX19 proteins in <italic>TBX19<sup>K146R/K146R</sup></italic> organoids (n= 10 organoids for each group, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3C</xref>, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3D</xref>).</p>
<p>Finally, in order to take into account the possibility of regionalized sampling in the section, we performed quantitative analysis of ACTH by transparizing organoids immunostained for the hormone and imaging them by light-sheet confocal microscopy. 3D reconstruction confirmed that ACTH was nearly absent from <italic>TBX19</italic> KI organoids on day 105 compared to control organoids (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4A</xref>-<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4B</xref> and <bold>Suppl Movies 1-2</bold>). We observed that corticotroph cell distribution was not uniform throughout the organoids, but was rather concentrated in one or a few buds.

<title>NFKB2 signaling is vital for corticotroph development</title>
<p>As our organoid model for the study of ACTHD was validated with the <italic>TBX19</italic> mutant line, we then used the same approach to investigate the potential role of NFKB2 in human hypothalamic-pituitary development. To do so, we first established a <italic>NFKB2</italic> KI mutant hiPSC line using CRISPR/Cas9 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>) from an isogenic control. The <italic>NFKB2<sup>D865G</sup></italic> homozygous mutation was chosen because it has been shown to severely affect NFKB2 p52 processing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>.

<p>As MRI had revealed pituitary hypoplasia in 43% of patients with DAVID syndrome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>, we investigated whether mutant organoids might be smaller than WT organoids. Comparing the volume of both types of organoids on day 105, we found no significant difference (p= 0.6, WT n=7, mutant n= 8, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6G</xref>). In line with qRT-PCR results, immunostaining showed less expression of LHX3 in <italic>NFKB2</italic> KI organoids on day 48 compared to the WT (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figures 7A</xref>-<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7B</xref>). NFKB2 (the antibody did not discriminate between p100/p52 isoforms) was robustly expressed in WT LHX3+ pituitary progenitors on day 48 (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A</xref>).

<p>During pituitary development, progenitors undergo epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT). Data from human fetuses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup> suggest that pituitary stem cells/progenitors are in an hybrid state, as they simultaneously express “stemness” as well as epithelial and mesenchymal-associated genes, and expression of all these gene sets decrease in concert during the course of differentiation. While the overall number of anterior pituitary-type cells in <italic>NFKB2</italic> KI organoids was not affected, as confirmed by RT-qPCR of the pan-pituitary cell adhesion marker <italic>EPCAM</italic>, there was a significant decrease in the expression of stemness markers such as <italic>HES1</italic>, <italic>SOX2</italic> and <italic>SOX9</italic> <bold>(</bold><xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref><bold>, left panel)</bold>, accompanied by increased expression of stem cell-associated epithelial markers <italic>CDH1</italic> and <italic>KRT8</italic> <bold>(</bold><xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref><bold>, middle panel)</bold> and decreased expression of stem cell-associated mesenchymal markers <italic>CDH2</italic> and <italic>VIM</italic>.

<p>Interestingly, other lineages also appeared to be affected, both in <italic>TBX19</italic> KI and <italic>NFKB2</italic> KI organoids. RNA-seq at d48 showed drastic downregulation of <italic>PROP1</italic> and <italic>POU1F1</italic> transcription factors in <italic>NFKB2</italic> mutants. Although we could not accurately measure <italic>POU1F1</italic> expression at d48 due to its too low expression, RT-qPCR (<xref rid="fig11" ref-type="fig">Figure 11</xref>) showed that <italic>PROP1</italic> downregulation was also occurring in <italic>TBX19</italic> KI organoids at d48 (<xref rid="fig11" ref-type="fig">Figure 11A</xref><bold>, left</bold>), and both <italic>PROP1</italic> and <italic>POU1F1</italic> levels were barely detectable at d75 in the two models (<xref rid="fig11" ref-type="fig">Figure 11A</xref><bold> and </bold><xref rid="fig11" ref-type="fig">11D</xref>). This is likely to be the consequence of the impaired generation of pituitary progenitors described above. Nonetheless, other transcription factor markers of <italic>POU1F1</italic> -dependent lineages were expressed, as shown by normal expression of <italic>NEUROD4</italic> and <italic>ZBTB20</italic> in <italic>TBX19</italic> KI organoids at d48 (<xref rid="fig11" ref-type="fig">Figure 11B</xref><bold> and </bold><xref rid="fig11" ref-type="fig">11C</xref><bold>, left</bold>). However, both genes had lower expression levels at 75 compared to WT (<xref rid="fig11" ref-type="fig">Figure 11B</xref><bold> and </bold><xref rid="fig11" ref-type="fig">11C</xref><bold>, right</bold>).

Again, these results suggest that different mechanisms converge on impaired POU1F1-dependent lineage development.</p>
<p>Finally, the glycoprotein hormone common alpha subunit <italic>CGA</italic> was strongly upregulated at d48 (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) and d75 (data not shown) in <italic>NFKB2</italic> KI organoids. The concomitant increase in <italic>GATA2, CYP11A1</italic> and <italic>FOLR1</italic> may suggest a redirection of some progenitors towards a gonadotroph/thyrotroph cell fate. However, lack of changes in expression of <italic>NR5A1</italic>, <italic>NEUROD1</italic> and <italic>SOX11</italic>, and the undetectable transcripts for the specific beta subunits <italic>FSHB</italic>, <italic>LHB</italic> and <italic>TSHB</italic> before d105, do not favour this hypothesis.</p>
<p>A few years ago, ChIP-seq experiments on Hodgkin lymphoma cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup> identified 10,893 DNA-binding regions for NFKB2 p52, within or in the close vicinity of 5,497 genes. About half of p52 recruitments occurred in transcribed regions, with a high percentage within introns, and the other half in intergenic regions close to a transcriptional start site (TSS). Among the 4,819 differentially regulated genes identified in <italic>NFKB2</italic> KI organoids at d48, 1,398 of them had p52 binding regions nearby (<xref rid="fig12" ref-type="fig">Figure 12</xref>), of which 23 belong to our curated list of pituitary genes of interest. Among them, we found genes crucial for progenitor development (<italic>SOX9</italic>, <italic>PITX1</italic>), EMT (<italic>CDH1</italic>, <italic>ZEB2</italic>), POU1F1-dependent lineages (<italic>PROP1</italic>, <italic>NEUROD4</italic>), and most importantly, the principal genes of corticotroph development and maturation (<italic>TBX19</italic>, <italic>NR4A2</italic>, <italic>PCSK1</italic>, <italic>POMC</italic>). Thus, these changes in the expression of these genes we observed in <italic>NFKB2</italic> KI organoids may be due to a direct effect on transcriptional regulation.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>After the description of DAVID syndrome as a rare combination of anterior pituitary deficit, mostly ACTHD, with common variable immunodeficiency, we and others found that it is associated with <italic>NFKB2</italic> gene mutations affecting specific C-terminal residues of the NFKB2 protein, known to play important roles in immunity and also expressed in the pituitary<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>. As the mouse model harboring a similar alteration of the ortholog gene lacked an endocrine phenotype<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>, we wanted to investigate the mechanism of ACTHD in this syndrome. Currently available <italic>in vitro</italic> models to study ACTHD and CPHD have strong limits. For instance, studies based on transfections and luciferase-coupled hormone promoters can only give indirect evidence of the effect of a variant of unknown significance as they are based on partly arbitrary amounts of DNA and promoters in an artificial context<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. Murine models only partially replicate human CPHD, as shown for <italic>PROP1</italic> mutations and the occurrence of ACTHD (absent in mice but present in 40% of humans)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup>. In the past decade, the reprogramming of differentiated adult cells into induced pluripotent stem cells and advancements in genome editing technologies using CRISPR/Cas9 systems have broadened possibilities for modeling novel aspects of human disease <italic>ex vivo</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup>. Organoid culture has become a powerful tool for modeling otherwise inaccessible congenital human disorders in many organs such as brain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>, intestine<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup>, kidney<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup>, liver<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup>, pancreas<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup>, ovary<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup>, and lung<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></sup>. In the present study, we established a human <italic>in vitro</italic> model of congenital ACTHD using 3D pituitary organoids differentiated from <italic>TBX19</italic> KI and <italic>NFKB2</italic> KI hiPSC generated by CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing, in order to compare them with their WT equivalents on the same genetic background. After confirming that our model could replicate pituitary development, we then determined whether it could also replicate a disease, namely ACTHD. As the <italic>TBX19<sup>K146R</sup></italic> homozygous variant led to ACTHD in humans, we designed a human “KI” organoid model derived from <italic>TBX19<sup>K146R/K146R</sup></italic> hiPSC. In line with the <italic>Tbx19<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mouse model<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>, <italic>TBX19</italic> KI organoids displayed markedly defective corticotroph differentiation, as compared to WT organoids, thereby validating the methodological approach. Interestingly, in organoids carrying a <italic>TBX19<sup>K146R/K146R</sup></italic> missense mutation that affects DNA binding, a few corticotrophs were still present, suggesting either a role for TBX19 independent of its DNA binding activity or persistence of residual DNA binding activity with this mutation. This model also raises the possibility for a previously undescribed role of TBX19 during early development and the generation of pituitary progenitors in human. However, as <italic>TBX19</italic> mutations have only rarely been associated with other pituitary deficits - especially transient GHD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref></sup>, further investigations will be needed.</p>

</fig>
<p>Using this same approach with <italic>NFKB2<sup>D865G/D865G</sup></italic> human organoids generated by CRISPR/Cas9 genome edited hiPSC, we demonstrated for the first time a role for NFKB2 in pituitary development. Heterozygous mutations in the C-terminal region of <italic>NFKB2</italic>, such as D865G, were reported in DAVID syndrome, leading to the disruption of both non-canonical and canonical pathways<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref></sup>. Even though <italic>NFKB2<sup>D865G</sup></italic> was identified in a heterozygous state in patients with ACTHD, we decided to use a homozygous model of <italic>NFKB2</italic> KI to determine whether NFKB2 was involved in pituitary development and could explain the defect in ACTH production in DAVID syndrome (OMIM#, 615577) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref></sup>. Indeed, while concomitant common variable immune deficiency (CVID) can be explained by the key roles of NFKB signaling in the immune system, the mechanism of the endocrine deficits caused by <italic>NFKB2</italic> mutants was unknown. In mouse models, deletion of <italic>Nfkb2</italic> cause abnormal germinal center B-cell formation and differentiation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>. However, the <italic>Lym1</italic> mouse model, which carries a truncating variant Y868* in the <italic>Nfkb2</italic> orthologue that prevents its cleavage into a transcriptionally active form, had apparently normal corticotroph function and ACTH expression in the pituitary in both heterozygotes and homozygotes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>, despite reduced fertility and more severe immune abnormalities in mutant <italic>NFKB2</italic> homozygotes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref></sup>. Using pituitary organoids differentiated from a <italic>NFKB2</italic> KI hiPSC line in comparison with its unmutated control and in the absence of an immune response, we have demonstrated that human corticotroph development is directly disrupted by the missense mutation found in DAVID syndrome. The absence of global alteration of NFKB signaling pathway shows that mutant p100/p52 protein is directly responsible for the observed phenotype.</p>
<p>The precise molecular mechanisms by which <italic>NFKB2</italic> mutation impairs corticotroph development remain to be determined. However, our results (summarized in <xref rid="fig14" ref-type="fig">Figure 14</xref>) suggest both early effects on the maturation of pituitary progenitors, on epithelial to mesenchymal transition, and late effects on corticotroph differentiation. First, The <italic>NFKB2</italic> gene product p52 could be involved in the early steps of pituitary development. RNA-seq data on day 48 of <italic>NFKB2</italic> KI organoid development showed increased <italic>HESX1</italic> and <italic>BMP4</italic> transcription, in favor of a blockade in an undifferentiated state evocative of the Rathke’s pouch epithelial primordium: indeed, down-regulation of HESX1 is necessary for proper pituitary development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref></sup>. This is also suggested by RNA-seq results showing downregulation of <italic>PITX1, HES1, LHX3</italic> and <italic>FGF10</italic> in mutant organoids, whereas their expression is necessary for progression to a progenitor state<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref></sup>. The shift in the <italic>BMP4</italic> /<italic>FGF10</italic> balance favors the idea that the impaired differentiation of pituitary progenitors is at least in part of hypothalamic origin. Our results also suggest a disorganized EMT process, and the need for a functional p100/p52 to mediate the action of EMT inducers on CDH1 downregulation. Finally, concordant with the hypothesis of a differentiation blockade, upregulation of epithelial markers such as <italic>CDH1</italic> and <italic>KRT8</italic> was observed in mutant <italic>NFKB2</italic> KI organoids on day 48. In contrast, RNA-seq showed no change in Wnt and Hedgehog signaling pathways in <italic>NFKB2</italic> KI organoids.</p>

</fig>
<p>The <italic>NFKB2</italic> gene product p52 could also be involved in the final steps of corticotroph differentiation. While qRT-PCR showed increased levels of <italic>TBX19</italic> mRNA in mutant organoids, this did not lead to the expected increase in <italic>POMC</italic> mRNA transcripts. Moreover, some <italic>NFKB2</italic> mutants had TBX19+ cells without ACTH expression. This suggests that p52 is necessary for POMC synthesis, which <italic>NFKB2<sup>D865G</sup></italic> may prevent. This could be due to an abnormal DNA binding of the NFKB heterodimer to the <italic>POMC</italic> promoter<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref></sup>, but as other NFKB binding sites are found in intronic regions, it may also be involved in changes in chromatin structures required for proper transcription. The same possibilities apply to <italic>PCSK1</italic>, the gene coding for the enzyme necessary for POMC to ACTH conversion, and to other genes involved in corticotroph maturation. Besides, <italic>NFKB2<sup>D865G</sup></italic> could also block TBX19+ cells in a pre-differentiated state of corticotroph cells expressing FST through its derepression of chromatin remodeling factors such as EZH2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>GH deficiency has been reported in some patients with heterozygous <italic>NFKB2</italic> mutations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. The drastic effect on <italic>POU1F1</italic> expression we observed is likely to be the consequence of different phenomena. First, the impaired development of progenitors, and the disruption of <italic>PROP1</italic> expression, possibly due to the absence of p52. Second, both <italic>FOXO1</italic> and <italic>NEUROD4</italic> have p52 binding regions and were differentially expressed. Alongside <italic>POU1F1</italic>, these two genes have been described as crucial members of a feedforward loop controlling somatotroph function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref></sup>. The 12-fold increase in <italic>CGA</italic> expression and increased expression of pre-gonadotropes or mature thyrotropes (<italic>GATA2</italic>) and mature gonadotropes (<italic>GATA2, CYP11A1</italic> and <italic>FOLR1</italic>) could be an argument in favor of a redirection of pituitary progenitors towards these lineages. However, lack of differential expression of <italic>NR5A1</italic> contradicts this hypothesis. A more likely explanation is that <italic>CGA</italic> repression by TBX19 may directly require p52.</p>
<p>The organoid model described in this article presents several advantages over other approaches. It is a true human model of ACTHD, emphasizing the limits of mouse models, as exemplified by the <italic>Lym1</italic> model, which showed that <italic>Nfkb2</italic> p100/p52 function was not essential for pituitary development in mice, but did not provide insights for humans. <italic>Nfkb2</italic><sup>Lym1/Lym1</sup> mice and our <italic>NFKB2</italic> KI model have different but functionally very similar mutations, as they both lead to an abnormal processing of p100 with its accumulation leading to a strong reduction of p52 content. The phenotype of <italic>Nfkb2</italic><sup>Lym1/Lym1</sup> being more severe than in mice lacking the complete NFKB2 protein (<italic>Nfkb2</italic><sup>−/−</sup>), these dominant-negative mutations have been called “super repressors”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref></sup>. In light of our results, it is surprising that no pituitary deficiencies have been observed in <italic>Nfkb2</italic><sup>−/−</sup> or <italic>Nfkb2</italic><sup>Lym1/Lym1</sup>. This suggests that in human, <italic>NFKB2</italic> plays an important role during pituitary development, therefore constituting a major inter-species difference. Studying p52 binding regions across different species may help understand how this role appeared during evolution.</p>
<p>All patients with DAVID syndrome harbour heterozygous <italic>NFKB2</italic> mutations. Whether this reflects embryonic lethality of the mutation at the homozygous state or just the rarity of this genotype is still an unresolved question. However “super repressor” mutations have been shown to disturb both canonical and non-canonical signalling pathways even when heterozygous<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. As our results show impaired POU1F1-dependent lineages development in addition to the severe corticotroph deficit, further experiments on organoids derived from <italic>NFKB2<sup>WT/D865G</sup></italic> hiPSCs should tell if there are differences in the sensitivity of different lineages to the dominant-negative protein. If so, this could give us clues about why DAVID patients suffer from isolated ACTHD in their vast majority rather than CPHD.</p>
<p>Despite some technical limits, CRISPR/Cas9-based genome editing of hiPSC is a powerful approach to elucidate gene function in congenital pituitary deficiency patients, as was shown for the role of hypothalamic OTX2 regulation of pituitary progenitor cells in congenital pituitary hypoplasia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. While the prevalence of pathogenic variants of known genes in primary hypopituitarism is currently estimated at below 10%<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>, exome and whole-genome sequencing regularly identify new genes and variants, for which pathogenicity remains uncertain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>. This model could thus become in the following years the gold standard to confirm the involvement of a given gene in pituitary development, or to classify new variants of unknown significance as likely benign or pathogenic. Finally, pituitary organoids derived from human embryonic stem cells have been transplanted subcutaneously into mice with hypopituitarism; grafted cells were able to secrete ACTH and respond to corticotropin-releasing hormone stimulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref></sup>, paving the way for innovative substitutive treatments in patients with hypopituitarism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref></sup>. Conversely, a limitation of this model is the long duration of the differentiation period (approximately 3 months) and the fact that not all hiPSC clones lead to full differentiation of hypothalamo-pituitary organoids despite similar conditions of culture. For these reasons, we could not include confirmation of our results on an independent clone in the present paper.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we have designed and validated a model replicating human constitutive ACTHD using a combination of CRISPR/Cas9 and directed differentiation of hiPSC into 3D hypothalamic-pituitary organoids. Not only has this proof-of-concept reproduced the known prerequisite for the TBX19 transcription factor in human corticotroph differentiation, but it has also allowed a new classification of a <italic>NFKB2</italic> variant of previously unknown clinical significance as pathogenic in pituitary development.</p>
<p>From a clinical viewpoint, this organoid model could provide evidence for the pathogenic role of new candidate genes or variants investigated in patients where none other is available, especially in a rare disease affecting a poorly accessible organ like the pituitary gland. From a physiological viewpoint, modeling corticotroph deficiency using hiPSC allows us to find evidence for a functional role for <italic>NFKB2</italic> in human pituitary differentiation.</p>
<p>Future studies investigating the direct role of p52 on transcription and changes in chromatin landscape during pituitary development will be necessary to elucidate its precise mechanism of action, as well as the level of pathogenicity of the <italic>NFKB2<sup>D865G</sup></italic> mutations in its heterozygous form.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>NFKB mutations are thought to be one of the causes of pituitary dysfunction, but until now they could not be reproduced in mice and their pathomechanism was unknown. The authors used the differentiation of hypothalamic-pituitary organoids from human pluripotent stem cells to recapitulate the disease in human iPS cells carrying the NFKB mutation.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors achieved their primary goal of recapitulating the disease in human cells. In particular, the differentiation of the pituitary gland is closely linked to the adjacent hypothalamus in embryology, and the authors have again shown that this method is useful when the hypothalamus is suspected to be involved in pituitary abnormalities caused by genetic mutations.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>On the other hand, the pathomechanism is still not fully understood. This study provides some clues to the pathomechanism, but further analysis of NFKB expression and experiments investigating the relevant factors in more detail may help to clarify it further.</p>
<p>
As for the revised manuscript, it is still insufficient for understanding the role of NFKB2 in pituitary development although their additional experiments have improved the manuscript. The strength of the hypothalamus-pituitary organoid lies in its ability to recapitulate the differentiation process including not only the pituitary cells but also neighbouring non-pituitary cells, such as hypothalamic cells in vitro. It is necessary to determine &quot;at which stages&quot; and &quot;in which localizations&quot; NFKB2 expression is critical for pituitary development.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>DAVID syndrome is a rare autosomal dominant disorder characterized by variable immune dysfunction and variable ACTH deficiency. Nine different families have been reported, and all have heterozygous mutations in NFKB2. The mechanism of NFKB2 action in the immune systems has been well-studied, but nothing is known about its role in pituitary gland.</p>
<p>The DAVID mutations cluster in the C-terminus of the NFKB2 and interfere with cleavage and nuclear translocation. The mutations are likely dominant negative, by affecting dimer function. ACTH deficiency can be life-threatening in neonates and adults, thus, understanding the mechanism of NFKB2 action in pituitary development and/or function is important.</p>
<p>The authors use CRISPR/Cas gene editing of human iPSC derived pituitary-hypothalamic organoids to assess the function of NFKB2 and TBX19 in pituitary development. Mutations in TBX19 are the most common, known cause of pituitary ACTH deficiency, and the mechanism of action has been studied in mice, which phenocopy the human condition. Thus, the TBX19 organoids can serve as a positive control. The Nfkb2 mouse model has a p.Y868* mutation that impairs cleavage of NFKB2 p100, and the immune phenotype mimics the patients with DAVID mutations, but no pituitary phenotype was evident. Thus, a human organoid model might be the only approach suitable to discover the etiology of the pituitary phenotype.</p>
<p>Overall, the authors have selected an important problem, and the results suggest that the pituitary insufficiency in DAVID syndrome is caused by a developmental defect rather than an autoimmune hypophysitis condition. The use of gene editing in human iPSC derived hypothalamic-pituitary organoids is significant, as there is only one example of this previously, namely studies on OTX2. Only a few laboratories have demonstrated the ability to differentiate iPSC or ES cells to these organoids, and the authors have improved the efficiency of differentiation, which is also significant.</p>
<p>The strength of the evidence is excellent. The authors have thoroughly analyzed the genetically engineered organoids compared to isogenic controls. They have validated their findings with analysis of RNA and proteins. They have studied the time course of differentiation in the organoids and have a robust experimental design involving many replicates. Analysis of additional clones could strengthen the evidence.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors make mutations in TBX19 and NFKB2 that exist in affected patients. The TBX19 p.K146R mutation is recessive and causes isolated ACTH deficiency. Mutations in this gene account for 2/3 of isolated ACTH deficiency cases. The NFKB2 p.D865G mutation is heterozygous in a patient with recurrent infections and isolated ACTH deficiency. NFKB2 mutations are a rare cause of ACTH deficiency, and they can be associated with loss of other pituitary hormones in some cases. However, all reported cases are heterozygous.</p>
<p>
The developmental studies of organoid differentiation are rigorous in that 200 organoids were generated for each hiPSC line, and 3-10 organoids were analyzed for each time point and genotype. Differentiation analysis relied on both RNA transcript measurements and immunohistochemistry of cleared organoids using light sheet microscopy. Multiple time points were examined, including seven times for gene expression at the RNA level and two times in the later stages of differentiation for IHC.</p>
<p>
TBX19 deficient organoids exhibit reduced levels of PITX1, LHX3, and POMC (ACTH precursor) expression at the RNA and IHC level, and there are fewer corticotropes in the organoids, as ascertained by POMC IHC.</p>
<p>
The NFKB2 deficient organoids have normal expression of the early pituitary transcription factor HESX1, but reduced expression of PITX2, LHX3 and POMC. Because there is no immune component in the organoid, this shows that NFKB2 mutations can affect corticotrope differentiation to produce POMC. RNA sequencing analysis of the organoids reveals potential downstream targets of NFKB2 action, including a potential effect on epithelial to mesenchymal like transition and selected pituitary and hypothalamic transcription factors and signaling pathways.</p>
<p>It is important to note that all NFKB2 patients are heterozygous for what appear to be dominant negative mutations that affect protein cleavage and nuclear localization of processed protein as homo or heterodimers. The organoids are homozygous for this mutation.</p>
<p>Weakness:</p>
<p>There could be variation between individual iPSC lines that is unrelated to the genetically engineered change. The work would be strengthened by analysis of independently engineered clones or by correcting the engineered clone to wild type and demonstrating that the phenotypic effects are reversed. The authors do check for off target effects of the guide RNA at predicted sites using WGS.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This manuscript by Mac et al addresses the causes of pituitary dysfunction in patients with DAVID syndrome which is caused by mutations in the NFKB2 gene and leads to ACTH deficiency. The authors seek to determine whether the mutation directly leads to altered pituitary development, as opposed to an autoimmune defect, by using mutating human iPSCs and then establishing organoids that differentiate into pituitary tissue. They first seek to validate the system using a well-characterised mutation of the transcription factor TBX19, which also results in ACTH deficiency in patients. Then they characterise altered pituitary cell differentiation in mutant NFKB2 organoids and show that these lack corticotrophs, which would lead to ACTH deficiency. Importantly, the findings here suggest the effects of mutant NFKB2 on pituitary organoid differentiation are direct and not a result of altered noncanonical NF-κB signalling, which has been shown to be a mechanism leading to immunodeficiency in DAVID patients.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The conclusion of the paper that ACTH deficiency in DAVID syndrome is independent of an autoimmune input is strong.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) The authors correctly emphasise the importance of establishing the validity of an iPSC-based model in being able to recapitulate in vivo dysfunctional pituitary development through characterisation of a TBX19 knock-in mutation. Whilst this leads to the expected failure of functional corticotroph differentiation, other aspects of the normal pituitary differentiation pathway upstream of cortocotroph commitment seem to have been affected in surprising ways. In particular, the loss of LHX3 and PITX1 in TBX19 mutant organoids compared with wild type requires explanation, especially as the mutant protein would only be expected to be expressed in a small proportion of anterior pituitary lineage cells. This may identify a difference between human and mouse pituitary development and emphasises the importance of further establishing the developmental programme in human pituitary.</p>
<p>(2) It is notable that the manipulation of iPSC cells used to generate mutants through CRISPR/Cas9 editing is not applied to the control iPSC line. It is possible that these manipulations, including electroporation and puromycin selection may lead to changes to the iPSC cells that is independent of the mutations introduced and this may change the phenotype of the cells. The authors have established that there are no off-target mutations through whole genome sequencing but the iPSC manipulation could have led to changes through epigenetic mechanisms or through non-genomic alterations of developmental potential. A better control in all experiments would have been an iPSC line with a benign knock-in (such as GFP into the ROSA26 locus) or use of a selected line where editing failed. The authors also ackowledge that use of a single clone is not ideal in these studies and characterisation of multiple clones would strengthen the conclusions of the study.</p>

<p>We agree with these considerations and the summary and thank the Editors for their assessment. Although we indeed share the idea that reproduction of the experiments on a second clone would be a useful confirmatory step, we have not been able to reach this goal within a reasonable time frame for the reason mentioned above (unavailability of the main research engineer knowledgeable in the challenging methods involved for organoids differentiation) and due to the long turnaround time of this kind of experiments (3 months for the whole differentiation starting form iPSC). We therefore decided to publish on a single clone while we are still aiming at reproducing our results on at least a second one and will hopefully be able to provide these additional data in a subsequent revised version. We now acknowledge this limitation in the final part of the Discussion.</p>
<p>Revised text: “Conversely, a limitation of this model is the long duration of the differentiation period (approximately 3 months) and the fact that not all hiPSC clones lead to full differentiation of hypothalamo-pituitary organoids despite similar conditions of culture. For these reasons, we could not include confirmation of our results on an independent clone in the present paper.”</p>

<p>We thank this reviewer for acknowledging that we've reached our primary objective, in particular the fact that the HPO (hypothalamo-pituitary organoid) model allows recapitulation of the disease in human cells, including hypothalamic-pituitary interactions. Regarding the pathophysiological mechanism of the disease, we must admit that it remains incompletely understood. However, we have analysed more samples by RT-qPCR and further analysed RNASeq data from <italic>NFKB2</italic> KI organoids, which provided with more insights into the different levels where NFKB2 may play a role. We have now provided several additional figures derived from these analyses, including a synthetic figure to summarize the most relevant observed effects (Fig. 14).</p>

<p>The strength of the evidence is excellent. However, the two ACTH-deficient organoid models use a single genetically engineered clone, and the potential for variability amongst clones makes the conclusions less compelling. Since the authors obtained two independent clones for NFKB2 it is not clear why only one clone was studied.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We experienced difficulties obtaining an hiPSC population devoid of spontaneous differentiation while purifying this second clone, and did not want to delay the start of the experiments. This clone will be analysed in a follow-up study.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Finally, the effect of TBX19 on early pituitary fate markers is somewhat surprising given the phenotype of the knockout mice and patients with mutations. Thus, the use of a single clone for that study is also worrisome.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree that the effect of the TBX19 mutant on early pituitary progenitor development is rather puzzling. In our model, TBX19 is expressed throughout the whole experiment, although it is at very low levels in undifferentiated hiPSCs compared to peak expression (over 50-fold difference).</p>
<p>During the CRISPR-Cas9 gene edition, we obtained a clone with a homozygous one base insertion at the cutting site, leading to a frameshift and a premature stop codon 48 bases downstream. This would result in an expected protein of 163 amino acids instead of 488, but with potentially still functional DNA-binding ability. This mutation had a similar effect on <italic>LHX3</italic> and <italic>PITX1</italic> as the <italic>TBX19</italic> KI mutation, although it was even more severe. Our most likely explanation is that the two TBX19 mutants we generated have dominant negative effects. Contrary to mouse, little is known about <italic>TBX19</italic> expression in early human pituitary development, but scRNA-seq data on human embryonic pituitaries (Zhang et al.) show low expression in undifferentiated pituitary progenitors between 7 and 9 weeks of gestation. Therefore, early expression of these dominant negative proteins could perturb differentiation in the organoids. Future development of hiPSCs lines with total absence of TBX19 should help clarify these questions.</p>

We also agree that analysing more clones, generated from same or different hiPSC lines, carrying homozygous or heterozygous mutations, and corrected mutations will be necessary in the future.</p>

<p>It is notable that the manipulation of iPSC cells used to generate mutants through CRISPR/Cas9 editing is not applied to the control iPSC line. It is possible that these manipulations lead to changes to the iPSC cells that are independent of the mutations introduced and this may change the phenotype of the cells. A better control would have been an iPSC line with a benign knock-in (such as GFP into the ROSA26 locus).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree that the issue of off-target mutations should be addressed. However, we performed whole genome sequencing on <italic>TBX19</italic> KI and did not observe any pathogenic variants other than the intended edition. We also checked that clones isolated during the screening procedure but that returned negative for editing still had the ability to generate pituitary cells. However, we made the choice to use the isogenic original hiPSC line as it could be compared to both TBX19 <italic>KI</italic> and NFKB2 <italic>KI</italic> simultaneously, therefore reducing workload and cost of the experiments. Any other knock-in mutation, such as GFP into the ROSA26 locus would imply the same risk of off-target mutations, but presumably at other sites in the genome.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) In the results section of the manuscript the authors acknowledge that hypothalamic tissue in the NFKB2 mutant organoid may be having an effect on the development of pituitary tissue. However, in the discussion the emphasis is entirely on pituitary autonomous mechanisms such as pituitary HESX1 expression or POMC gene regulation; in the conclusion of the abstract, a direct role for NFKB2 in pituitary differentiation is described. Whilst the data here may suggest a non-immune mediated alteration in pituitary function in DAVID syndrome, if this is due to alteration of the developing hypothalamus then this is not direct. A fuller discussion of the potential hypothalamic contribution and/or further characterisation of this aspect is warranted.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with this reviewer that contributions of both hypothalamic and pituitary developing tissues should be taken into account. We performed more experiments and analysed the effect of both mutations on hypothalamic growth factors expression. These results are displayed in new figure 10. The role of the hypothalamus is now clearly mentioned and highlighted in the Discussion.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) qRT-PCR data presented in Figure 6A shows negligible alteration of HESX1 expression at all time points in NFKB2 mutant organoids. This is not consistent with the 2-fold increase in HESX1 expression described in day 48 organoids found by bulk RNA sequencing.</p>
<p>How do the authors reconcile these results and why is one result focused on in the discussion where a potential mechanism for a blockade of normal pituitary cell differentiation is suggested? Further confirmation of HESX1 expression is required.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In the previous version on the manuscript, the <italic>HESX1</italic> fold-change ratio between <italic>NFKB2</italic> KI and WT at d48 was of 2.06 (p=0.22). However, the type of representation for expression kinetics (values relative to the expression peak in WT) and the scale used made it difficult to see. In the new version of the manuscript, we analysed more samples from the same experiments, and new figure (now 6B) shows significant increase of <italic>HESX1</italic> expression (Fc = 2.46, p=0.019) in <italic>NFKB2</italic> KI.</p>
<p>Also, qPCR results come from at least two different experiments whereas RNAseq come from a single one. For RT-qPCR, 6 HPOs per genotype were picked and further analysed. As we found that only 60-70% of organoids show signs of pituitary cell differentiation, we chose to perform a preselection of organoids, based on RT-qPCR expression of selected markers (<italic>SOX2</italic>, <italic>HESX1</italic>, <italic>PITX1</italic>, <italic>LHX3</italic>, <italic>TBX19</italic>, <italic>POU1F1</italic> and <italic>POMC</italic>) in order to avoid having “empty” HPOs sent for bulk RNAseq. We compared <italic>HESX1</italic> expression ratios obtained by the two different techniques on the same samples (the ones used for RNA-seq) and found values of 2.19 (p=0.03) and 1.83 (p=0.061) for RNA-seq and RT-qPCR respectively. This is illustrated in Supplementary Figure 7. Our new results thus clearly demonstrate the increase in HESX1 expression in NFKB2 KI from d27 to d75.</p>

<p>(4) Throughout the authors focus on POMC gene expression and ACTH antibody immunopositive as being indicative of corticotroph cell identity. In the human fetal pituitary melanotrophs are present and most ACTH antibodies are unable to distinguish these cells from corticotrophs. Is the antibody used specifically for ACTH rather than other products of the POMC gene? It is unlikely that all the ACTH-positive cells are melanotrophs, nevertheless, it is important to know what the proportions of the 2 POMC-positive cell types are. This could be distinguished by looking for the expression of NeuroD1, which would also define whether corticotrophs are committed but not fully differentiated in the NFKB2 mutant organoids. In support of an effect on corticotrophs, it is notable that CRHR1 expression (which would be expected to be restricted to this cell type) is reduced by 84% in bulk RNAseq data (Table 1) and this may be an indicator of the loss of corticotrophs in the model.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The antibody we used is directed against ACTH. In HPOs, PAX7 expression was barely detected during the whole experiment. Moreover, although PCSK2 transcripts were observed, their expression started very early (d27) and remained constant, suggesting that an expression of this gene in hypothalamic cells rather than pituitary cells. All these observations suggest that melanotrophs are very unlikely to be present in HPOs.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) Notwithstanding the caveats about whether the organoid model recapitulates in vivo pituitary differentiation (see 1 above) and whether the bulk RNAseq accurately reflects expression levels (see 3 above), there are potentially some extremely interesting changes in gene expression shown in Table 1 which warrant further discussion. For example, there is a 25-fold reduction in POU1F1 expression which may be expected to reflect a loss of somatotrophs in the organoid (and possibly lactotrophs) and highlights the importance of characterising the effect of NFKB2 on other anterior pituitary cell types within the organoid. If somatotrophs are affected, this may be relevant to the organoids as a model of DAVID syndrome as GH deficiency has been described in some individuals with NFKB2 mutations. The huge increase in CGA expression may reflect a switch in cell fate to gonadotrophs, as has been described with a loss of TPIT in the mouse. These are examples of the changes that warrant further characterisation and discussion.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We performed a more in-depth analysis of other pituitary lineages (mainly somatotrophs). We confirmed the strong reduction in <italic>PROP1</italic> and <italic>POU1F1</italic> expression in <italic>NFKB2</italic> KI organoids. Although the strong increase in <italic>CGA</italic> expression in the mutant may raise the possibility of a redirection towards gonadotroph lineage, the lack of change in <italic>NR5A1</italic> expression may suggest otherwise.</p>
<p>These results are now illustrated in figure 12 and discussed in a full paragraph.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(6) How do the authors explain the lack of effect of NFKB2 mutation on global NFKB signalling?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The most likely explanation is that p100/p52 is not involved in controlling the expression of other members of NFKB signalling. Therefore, the absence of global alteration of NFKB signaling pathway shows that mutant p100/p52 protein is directly responsible for the observed phenotype.</p>

<p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p>
<p><bold>Reviewing editor summary of recommendation to authors:</bold></p>
<p>The use of hypothalamic-pituitary organoids can provide a fundamental understanding of pituitary gland development and differentiation. Their use to study human pituitary insufficiency is important, gaining insight into the aetiology of disease and if it implicates the hypothalamus or anterior pituitary. To this end, there is only one other example of their use in the literature, where Matsumoto et al, (2019), used OTX2-mutant hypothalamic-pituitary organoids to understand the aetiology of pituitary hypoplasia driven by OTX2 mutations. This being the second example of using gene editing in human iPSC-derived hypothalamic-pituitary organoids, these studies have improved the efficiency of differentiation previously published by Suga et al. (2011) for ES cells, and Matsumoto et al. (2019) for iPS cells. In addition, it has solidified that this method is useful, especially when studying hypothalamic involvement in human pituitary anomalies, due to the concerted development of these two structures.</p>
<p>The reviewers recognise the valuable insight provided into the mechanism of NFKB2 action during pituitary development and how this human organoid model might be one of the few or only approaches suitable to discover the aetiology of the pituitary phenotype.</p>
<p>The reviewers agree that both the evidence provided from the organoid model, as well as the characterisation of the phenotype are incomplete. In particular, the strength of evidence would be improved by analysing additional independent clones for both NFKB2 as well as TBX19 gene-edited iPSCs. Additionally, analysis of NFKB2 expression both in vivo and in the organoids, as well as analysis for the NFKB2 targets put forward, would be a lot more informative to help understand this phenotype.</p>
<p>The main recommendations discussed are summarised here and the reviewers have elaborated on these points in their individual reviews:</p>
<p>The two ACTH-deficient organoid models use a single genetically engineered clone, and the potential for variability amongst clones, unrelated to the mutation, makes the conclusions less compelling. Two independent homozygous clones were obtained for NFKB2 but only one was used, so analysis of the second clone would strengthen the findings. A heterozygous clone was also obtained and given all NFKB2 patients are heterozygous for what appears to be dominant negative mutations, the heterozygous clone ought to be analysed. Analyses of these additional clones would give more strength to the conclusions, showing reproducibility and the effect of mutant gene dosage. The reviewers provide excellent suggestions for alternative controls for the engineered iPSC lines in their specific comments.</p>
<p>The effect of TBX19 mutation on early pituitary fate markers LHX3 and PITX1 is surprising given the phenotype of the knockout mice and patients with mutations. If the developmental profile of essential transcription factors does not recapitulate the in vivo expression in this well-characterised mutant, this brings the organoid model into question. Thus, analysis of a further clone for the study of mutant TBX19 would be crucial. The validity of this control affects the interpretations relying on expression differences in the NFKB2-mutant organoids.</p>
<p>The study has implicated NFKB2 in pituitary development, but more insight is needed to fully understand disease pathogenesis. The authors presented potential downstream targets of NFKB2 action, including transcription factors and key signalling pathway components; further analyses of NFKB2 expression and experiments investigating the relevant factors in more detail will help elucidate this point.</p>
<p>Discerning between the hypothalamus and pituitary tissue is fundamental to interpreting phenotypes: (i) To pinpoint the primary tissue affected by NFKB2 deficiency, staining for NFKB2 during development in vivo will determine if this is expressed both in the developing hypothalamus and anterior pituitary gland or only one of these tissues. (ii) Using markers of hypothalamus and pituitary to discern between these two tissues in organoids, will provide a lot of valuable information where expression changes are presented. This would help discern the contribution of the developing hypothalamus as this is still unclear and has not been discussed. Knowing which tissue compartments NFKB2 is expressed in the organoids would also be of great value.</p>
<p>The organoids provide an opportunity to characterise the effects of NFKB2 on other pituitary cell types, since the bulk RNAseq presents intriguing changes indicating that not only corticotrophs may be affected. This may be of relevance to patients, which can have additional pituitary hormone deficiencies. If NFKB2 is expressed in the pituitary, demonstrating expression in the different cell types in vivo as well as in the organoids would help interpret the phenotype. Is this expressed only in corticotrophs/corticotroph precursors, or in additional endocrine cells?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with these considerations and the summary and thank the Editors for their assessment. Although we indeed share the idea that reproduction of the experiments on a second clone would be a useful confirmatory step, we have not been able to reach this goal within a reasonable time frame for the reason mentioned above (unavailability of the main research engineer knowledgeable in the challenging methods involved for organoids differentiation) and due to the long turnaround time of this kind of experiments (3 months for the whole differentiation starting form hiPSC). We therefore decided to publish on a single clone while we are still aiming at reproducing our results on at least a second one and will hopefully be able to provide these additional data in a subsequent revised version. We now acknowledge this limitation in the final part of the Discussion.</p>
<p>We have analysed more samples by RT-qPCR and further analysed RNASeq data from <italic>NFKB2</italic> KI organoids, which provided with more insights into the different levels where <italic>NFKB2</italic> may play a role. Specifically, we now show the effect of <italic>NFKB2</italic> mutation on hypothalamic growth factors and pituitary progenitor differentiation (figure 10), different stages of corticotroph maturation (figure 11) and effects on <italic>PROP1</italic>/<italic>POU1F1</italic>-dependent lineages (figure 12). We confronted our results to publicly available ChIPseq data concerning p52 transcriptional targets (figure 13). We have now provided several additional figures derived from these analyses, including a synthetic figure to summarize the most relevant observed effects (Fig. 14).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>In organoids, it is essential to stain for NFKB: is it the hypothalamus or the pituitary that expresses NFKB, and if the pituitary, is it the corticotroph itself or the surrounding cells? If immunostaining is not available, FISH or RNAscope can be used to look at expression.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Figure 7 shows stronger expression of p100/p52 in pituitary progenitors, and some expression in the hypothalamic part of the organoid. Due to current lack of biological material and length of experimental procedure, we could not yet determine which differentiated cell types express p100/p52, but this is clearly something we will look at in further experiments.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Regarding Figure 7, NFKB2 (D865G/D865G) shows no LHX3 expression already at day 48. It would be better to look at expression including PITX1 at an earlier time point to see at what point differentiation is impaired.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>RT-qPCR results show no statistically significant changes in <italic>PITX1</italic> (Fc=0.58, p=0.25) or <italic>LHX3</italic> (Fc = 0.15; p=0.22) expression at d27, although there was a tendency towards downregulation.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Is it really just a species difference that NFKB2-deficient mice do not have abnormal pituitary function? This needs to be discussed in the manuscript.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>_Nfkb2_Lym1/Lym1 mice and <italic>NFKB2</italic> KI model have different but functionally very similar mutations, as they both lead to an abnormal processing of p100 and a strong reduction of p52 content. In mice, these mutations are more severe than the complete absence of Nfkb2 gene product, and they have been called “super repressors”. It is therefore surprising that no pituitary phenotype as been observed in mice. In our opinion, this constitutes a strong argument in favour of an inter-species difference, at least for the pathogenicity of this type of mutations.</p>
<p>This point is now addressed in the Discussion</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Just looking at changes in gene expression by qPCR and bulk RNA-seq does not give enough information about localisation. We wish RNA-seq had at least been separated by FACS first. For example, FACS can separate the anterior pituitary and hypothalamus by EpCAM positivity/negativity (PMID: 35903276), so we would like to see gene expression in such separated samples.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This is a pertinent suggestion. We are aware of these techniques and we hope we will be able to include them in future studies</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>For Figures 2 and 6, just looking at changes in gene expression by qPCR does not provide localisation information, so either (1) immunostaining for LHX3 and NKX2.1 should be shown in each aggregate as in FigS3, or (2) qPCR should be performed on the FACSed cells. (2) qPCR on FACSed cells.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>PITX1, LHX3 (as confirmed by our immunofluorescence data) and HESX1 are only expressed in non-neural tissue. TBX19 could be expressed in the hypothalamic part of the organoid, but we observed very little immunostaining outside the outermost layers of organoids (i.e. pituitary tissue). The antibody we used to detect corticotrophs only recognizes ACTH, and therefore only marks pituitary cells.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>In addition, pathway and gene ontology analyses should be performed.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Pathways and gene ontology have been performed. However, as organoids consist of two different tissues, the analysis of over 4800 differentially expressed genes did not give us very informative results, apart from an impairment of retinoic acid signalling that we are currently investigating</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>The differentiation of iPSC to organoids could be variable. The authors indicate that 200 organoids were analyzed for each line, and 3-10 organoids were analyzed per time point, genotype, and assay. Is it clear that 100% of the organoids differentiate to produce corticotropes? Please clarify.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In our experiments, almost 90% of organoids give rise to non-neural ectoderm, as demonstrated by PITX1 expression. However, depending on experiments, only 60-70% of organoids give rise to pituitary progenitors (LHX3+) and subsequently to corticotropes. This has been clarified in the text.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>For TBX19, it seems surprising that there is an effect on PITX1 and LHX3 expression, since TBX19 expression is normally activated after these genes are expressed. An effect of TBX19 on EMT would also be surprising as the knockout mice do not have dysmorphology of the stem cell niche. The only evidence for an effect is the reduced IHC for E-cadherin. If this is an important point, the authors should examine other EMT markers such as Zeb2. The TBX19 knockout mice appear to form corticotropes based on the expression of NeuroD1, even though they lack TBX19 and POMC expression. It would be reassuring to see that NeuroD1 is normally expressed in the TBX19 mutant organoids.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree that the effect of the TBX19 mutant on early pituitary progenitor development is rather puzzling. In our model, TBX19 is expressed throughout the whole experiment, although it is at very low levels in undifferentiated hiPSCs compared to peak expression (over 50-fold difference).</p>
<p>During the CRISPR-Cas9 gene edition, we obtained a clone with a homozygous one base insertion at the cutting site, leading to a frameshift and a premature stop codon 48 bases downstream. This would result in an expected protein of 163 amino acids instead of 488, but with potentially still functional DNA-binding ability. This mutation had a similar effect on <italic>LHX3</italic> and <italic>PITX1</italic> as the <italic>TBX19</italic> KI mutation, although it was even more severe. Our most likely explanation is that the two TBX19 mutants we generated have dominant negative effects. Contrary to mouse, little is known about <italic>TBX19</italic> expression in early human pituitary development, but scRNA-seq data on human embryonic pituitaries (Zhang et al.) show low expression in undifferentiated pituitary progenitors between 7 and 9 weeks of gestation. Therefore, early expression of these dominant negative proteins could perturb differentiation in the organoids. Future development of hiPSCs lines with total absence of TBX19 should help clarify these questions.</p>
<p>Apart from the lack of change in <italic>ZEB2</italic> expression in TBX19 KI (Fc = 1.15; p = 0.35), we did not look further for changes in EMT markers in <italic>TBX19</italic> KI. However, we added a more detailed analysis for EMT markers expression in <italic>NFKB2</italic> KI based on RNAseq results (see table 2).</p>
<p>Due to lack of material, we could not confirm NEUROD1 expression by immunostaining. However, RT-qPCR showed there was no change in <italic>NEUROD1</italic> expression in <italic>TBX19</italic> KI (Fc = 0.81; p = 0.64)</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>NFKB2 IHC was markedly reduced in NFKB2 D865G/D865G organoids. Based on previous experiments, the mutant protein should be expressed but not activated by proteolytic cleavage. It is possible that the antibody has a different affinity for the mutant protein and/or the uncleaved protein may be unstable. Can this be clarified? The mRNA for mutant NFKB2 appears unchanged in Table 1.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This is puzzling indeed. We did not notice any change in <italic>NFKB2</italic> from d27 to d105, and no significant change either between WT and <italic>NFKB2</italic> KI. Although the antibody we used recognizes both p100 and p52, we cannot rule out the possibility that p100/p52 is degraded by pathways other than proteasome. Another possibility is that p100 interactions with other proteins may decrease the accessibility of the antibody to the epitope</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The RNA sequencing data from the NFKB2 organoids is intriguing. It suggests that the NFKB2 mutation may have a modest effect on Tbx19 transcription but not Neurod1. It also suggests there are hypothalamic effects, i.e. altered expression of hypothalamic markers in mutant organoids. Is NFKB2 expressed in the developing hypothalamus? Can normal NEUROD1 IHC be confirmed? It is also intriguing that there may be an effect on EMT. However, there seem to be some discrepancies in the direction of effect on these markers. Please clarify.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This is related to the point just above. P100/p52 is described as a ubiquitously expressed protein. We think that it is expressed in the hypothalamic part of the organoids, but at a lower level compared to pituitary progenitors.</p>
<p>As mentioned before, we could not yet confirm NEUROD1 expression by immunostaining, but RT-qPCR clearly showed there was no change in <italic>NEUROD1</italic> expression in <italic>TBX19</italic> KI (Fc = 0.81; p = 0.64) or NFKB2 <italic>KI</italic> (Fc = 0.88; p = 0.5). However, we investigated other markers of different stages of corticotroph differentiation (see figure 11) and found that the later stages are most affected.</p>
<p>Concerning the EMT, we also found changes in the expression of other markers that are shown in Table 2 and discussed further in the text.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Cytokines have been proposed to play important roles in pituitary differentiation, i.e. IL6. Is there any evidence for an altered cytokine or chemokine expression in the NFKB2 organoids?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We didn’t see any change in IL6 expression NFKB2 <italic>KI</italic> (Fc = 2.34; p = 0.55), but RNAseq shows a strong increase in IL6R (Fc = 8.89; p = 2.13e-09). But at this point, the relevance of these observations remains elusive.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Minor:</p>
<p>Some patients with DAVID syndrome have pituitary hypoplasia. The authors measure organoid size and find no differences based on genotype. However, each organoid probably has a variable amount of tissue differentiated to pituitary and hypothalamic fates, therefore, the volume of the whole organoid may not be a good proxy for the amount of pituitary tissue.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We are aware of this issue. However, for most pituitary genes measured by RT-qPCR (<italic>PITX1</italic>, <italic>LHX3</italic>, <italic>TBX19</italic>), the deltaCt values did not drastically vary for a given time point/genotype, suggesting a stable pituitary/hypothalamic ratio.</p>
