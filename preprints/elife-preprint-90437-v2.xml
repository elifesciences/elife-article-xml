<abstract>
<title>Abstract</title><p>Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is associated with higher fracture risk, despite normal or high bone mineral density. We reported that bone formation genes (<italic>SOST</italic> and <italic>RUNX2</italic>) and Advanced Glycation End-products (AGEs) were impaired in T2D. We investigated Wnt signaling regulation and its association with AGEs accumulation and bone strength in T2D from bone tissue of 15 T2D and 21 non-diabetic postmenopausal women undergoing hip arthroplasty. Bone histomorphometry revealed a trend of low mineralized volume in T2D [(T2D 0.249% (0.156-0.366) vs non-diabetic subjects 0.352% (0.269-0.454); p=0.053)], as well as reduced bone strength [T2D 21.60 MPa (13.46-30.10) vs non-diabetic subjects 76.24 MPa (26.81-132.9); p=0.002]. We also showed that gene expression of Wnt agonists <italic>LEF-1</italic> (p=0.0136) and <italic>WNT10B</italic> (p=0.0302) were lower in T2D. Conversely, gene expression of <italic>WNT5A</italic> (p=0.0232), <italic>SOST</italic> (p&lt;0.0001) and <italic>GSK3B</italic> (p=0.0456) were higher, while collagen (<italic>COL1A1</italic>) was lower in T2D (p=0.0482). AGEs content was associated with <italic>SOST</italic> and <italic>WNT5A</italic> (r=0.9231, p&lt;0.0001; r=0.6751, p=0.0322), but inversely correlated with <italic>LEF-1</italic> and <italic>COL1A1</italic> (r= -0,7500, p=0.0255; r= -0,9762, p=0.0004). <italic>SOST</italic> was associated with glycemic control and disease duration (r=0.4846, p=0.0043; r=0.7107, p=0.00174), whereas <italic>WNT5A</italic> and <italic>GSK3B</italic> were only correlated with glycemic control (r=0.5589, p=0.0037; r=0.4901, p=0.0051). Finally, Young’s Modulus was negatively correlated with <italic>SOST</italic> (r=-0.5675, p=0.0011), <italic>AXIN2</italic> (r=-0.5523, p=0.0042) and <italic>SFRP5</italic> (r=-0.4442, p=0.0437), while positively correlated with <italic>LEF -1</italic> (r=0.4116, p=0.0295) and <italic>WNT10B</italic> (r=0.6697, p=0.0001). These findings suggest that Wnt signaling, and AGEs could be the main determinants of bone fragility in T2D.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a metabolic disease, with an increasing worldwide prevalence, characterized by chronic hyperglycemia and adverse effects on multiple organ systems, including bones [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>]. Patients with T2D have an increased fracture risk, particularly at the hip, compared to individuals without diabetes. A recent meta-analysis reported that individuals with T2D have 1.27 relative risk (RR) of hip fracture compared to non-diabetic controls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>]. Fragility fractures in patients with T2D occur at normal or even higher bone mineral density compared to healthy subjects, implying compromised bone quality in diabetes. T2D is associated with a reduced bone turnover [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>], as shown by lower serum levels of biochemical markers of bone formation, such as procollagen type1 amino-terminal propeptide (P1NP) and osteocalcin, and bone resorption, C-terminal cross-linked telopeptide (CTX) in diabetic patients compared to nondiabetic individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>]. Accordingly, dynamic bone histomorphometry of T2D postmenopausal women showed a lower bone formation rate, mineralizing surface, osteoid surface, and osteoblast surface[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>]. Our group recently demonstrated that T2D is also associated with increased <italic>SOST</italic> and decreased <italic>RUNX2</italic> genes expression, compared to non-diabetic subjects[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>]. Moreover, we have proved in a diabetic model that a sclerostin-resistant <italic>Lrp5</italic> mutation, associated with high bone mass, fully protected bone mass and strength even after prolonged hyperglycemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>]. Sclerostin is a potent inhibitor of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway, a key pathway that regulates bone homeostasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>].</p>
<p>Diabetes and chronic hyperglycemia are also characterized by increased advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) production and deposition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>]. AGEs may interfere with osteoblast differentiation, attachment to the bone matrix, function, and survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>]. AGEs also alter bone collagen structure and reduce the intrinsic toughness of bone, thereby affecting bone material properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>]. In this work,we hypothesized that T2D and AGEs accumulation downregulate Wnt canonical signaling and negatively affect bone strength.. Results confirmed that T2D downregulates Wnt beta/catenin signaling and reduces collagen mRNA levels and bone strength, in association with AGEs accumulation.</p>

<title>Materials and Methods</title>
<sec id="s2a">
<title>Study subjects</title>
<p>We enrolled a total of 36 postmenopausal women (15 with T2D and 21 non-diabetic controls) undergoing hip arthroplasty for osteoarthritis, consecutively screened to participate in this study between 2020 and 2022. Diabetes status was confirmed by the treating diabetes physician. Participants were diagnosed with diabetes when they had fasting plasma glucose (FPG) ≥126 mg/dl or 2-h plasma glucose (2-h PG) ≥200 mg/dl during a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT); or hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) ≥6.5% in accordance with the American Diabetes Association diagnostic criteria. Eligible participants were ≥60 years of age. Exclusion criteria were any diseases affecting bone or malignancy. Additionally, individuals treated with medications affecting bone metabolism such as estrogen, raloxifene, tamoxifen, bisphosphonates, teriparatide, denosumab, thiazolidinediones, glucocorticoids, anabolic steroids, and phenytoin, and those with hypercalcemia or hypocalcemia, hepatic or renal disorder, hypercortisolism, current alcohol or tobacco use were excluded. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Campus Bio-Medico University of Rome and all participants provided written informed consent. All procedures were conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2b">
<title>Specimen preparation</title>
<p>Femoral head specimens were obtained during hip arthroplasty. As described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>], trabecular bone specimens were collected fresh and washed multiple times in sterile PBS until the supernatant was clear of blood. Bone samples were stored at – 80 °C until analysis.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2c">
<title>Bone histomorphometry</title>
<p>Trabecular bone from femur heads werefixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for 24 h prior to storage in 70% ethanol. Tissues were embedded in methylmethacrylate and sectioned sagittally by the Washington University Musculoskeletal Histology and Morphometry Core. Sections were stained with Goldner’s trichrome. Then, a rectangular region of interest containing trabecular bone was chosen below the cartilage-lined joint surface and primary spongiosa. This region had an average dimension of 45 mm<sup>2</sup>. Tissue processing artifacts, such as folding and edges, were excluded from the ROI. A threshold was chosen using the Bioquant Osteo software to automatically select trabeculae and measure bone volume. Finally, Osteoid was highlighted in the software and quantified semi-automatically using a threshold and correcting with the brush tool. Unstained and TRAP-stained (Sigma) slides were imaged at ×20 high resolution using a NanoZoomer 2.0 with bright field and FITC/TRITC (Hamamatsu Photonics). Images were then analyzed via Bioquant Osteo software according to the manufacturer’s instructions and published standards (v18.2.6, Bioquant Image Analysis Corp., Nashville, TN).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2d">
<title>Bone compression tests</title>
<p>We used cylindrical bone specimens of trabecular core (with a diameter of 10 mm and a length of 20 mm) from 10 T2D and 21 non-diabetic subjects to measure bone mechanical parameters (Young’s modulus, ultimate strength and yield strength), as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>].</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2e">
<title>RNA extraction and gene expression by RT-PCR</title>
<p>Total RNA from trabecular bone samples was extracted using TRIzol (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer’s instructions. The concentration and purity of the extracted RNA were assessed spectrophotometrically (TECAN, InfiniteM200PRO), and only samples with 260/280 absorbance ratio between 1.8 and 2 were used for reverse transcription using High-Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA) according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. Transcription products were amplified using TaqMan real-time PCR (Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA) and a standard protocol (95°C for 10 minutes; 40 cycles of 95°C for 15 seconds and 60°C for 1 minute; followed by 95°C for 15 seconds, 60°C for 15 seconds, and 95°C for 15 seconds). β-Actin expression was used as an internal control (housekeeping gene).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We show that key components of the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling are abnormally expressed in the bone of postmenopausal women with T2D and they are associated with AGEs and reduced bone strength. <italic>LEF-1</italic>, a transcription factor that mediates responses to Wnt signal and Wnt target genes itself, and <italic>WNT10B</italic>, an endogenous regulator of Wnt/β-catenin signaling and skeletal progenitor cell fate, are both downregulated in bone of postmenopausal women with T2D. Consistently, in this group, the expression of the Wnt inhibitor, <italic>SOST</italic> is increased, suggesting suppression of Wnt/β-catenin signaling. Interestingly, our data suggest that sclerostin expression is very low in healthy postmenopausal women not affected by osteoporosis. Moreover, we reported an increase in the expression level of bone <italic>GSK3B,</italic> in line with downregulated Wnt/β-catenin signaling in T2D. Our data also show that the expression of <italic>WNT5A</italic>, a non-canonical ligand linked to inhibition of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling was increased, whereas <italic>COL1A1</italic> was decreased. These findings are consistent with reduced bone formation and suppression of Wnt signaling in T2D. We have previously reported upregulation of <italic>SOST</italic> and downregulation of <italic>RUNX2</italic> mRNA in another cohort of postmenopausal women with T2D [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>]. Of note, the cohort of T2D subjects studied here had glycated hemoglobin within therapeutic targets, implying that the changes in gene transcription we identified persist in T2D bone despite good glycemic control.</p>
<p>High circulating sclerostin has been reported in diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>], and increased sclerostin is associated with fragility fractures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>]. Aside from confirming higher <italic>SOST</italic> expression, we also show that other Wnt/β-catenin osteogenic ligands are abnormally regulated in the bone of T2D postmenopausal women. <italic>WNT10B</italic> is a positive regulator of bone mass; transgenic overexpression in mice results in increased bone mass and strength [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>], whereas genetic ablation of <italic>WNT10B</italic> is characterized by reduced bone mass [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>], and decreased number and function of osteoblasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>]. More to the point, <italic>WNT10B</italic> expression is reduced in the bone of diabetic mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>]. Therefore, the reduced <italic>WNT10B</italic> in human bone we found in the present study further supports the hypothesis of reduced bone formation in T2D. Accordingly, <italic>LEF-1</italic> gene expression was also downregulated confirming that Wnt/beta-catenin pathway is decreased in T2D. Importantly, the overexpression of <italic>LEF-1</italic> induces the expression of osteoblast differentiation genes (osteocalcin and <italic>COL1A1</italic>) in differentiating osteoblasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>]. In fact, in this study we also demonstrated that a downregulation of <italic>LEF-1</italic> in T2D bone goes along with a downregulation of <italic>COL1A1</italic>, strengthen data of a reduced production of bone matrix most likely as the result of reduced osteoblasts synthetic activity in diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>]. Reduced <italic>RUNX2</italic> in T2D postmenopausal women also confirms previous findings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>] and further supports the notion of reduced osteoblast differentiation or function in diabetes. On the other hand, the contribution of upregulated <italic>WNT5A</italic> in diabetic bone is more complex. <italic>WNT5A</italic> regulates Wnt/beta-catenin signaling depending on the receptor availability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>]. Non-canonical <italic>WNT5A</italic> activates β-catenin-independent signaling, including the Wnt/Ca<sup>++</sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>] and planar cell polarity pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>].</p>
<p>Heterozygous Wnt5a null mice have low bone mass with impaired osteoblast and osteoclast differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>]. Wnt5a inhibits Wnt3a protein by downregulating beta/catenin-induced reporter gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>]. In line with these findings, we showed that there was an increased gene expression of <italic>WNT5A</italic> in bone of T2D postmenopausal women, confirming a downregulated Wnt/beta-catenin signaling and impaired osteoblasts function. Moreover, <italic>GSK3B</italic> is a widely expressed serine/threonine kinase involved in multiple pathways regulating immune cell activation and glucose metabolism. Preclinical studies reported that <italic>GSK3B</italic> is a negative regulator of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling and bone metabolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>], and its increase is associated with T2D and alterations in insulin secretion and sensitivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>]. Our data, confirmed that <italic>GSK3B</italic> is increased in T2D postmenopausal women and it is associated with reduced yield strength. In fact, we also showed an impaired bone mechanical plasticity in T2D, in line with other studies showing a reduced bone strength [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>]. In addition, this study reported significant correlations of bone mechanical parameters and Wnt target genes, which might reflect the biological effect of downregulated Wnt signaling and AGEs accumulation on bone mechanical properties in diabetes.</p>
<p>We have previously shown that AGEs content is higher in T2D bone compared to non-diabetic bone, even in patients with well-controlled T2D [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>]. Here we show that AGEs accumulation is positively correlated with <italic>SOST</italic>, <italic>WNT5A</italic> and <italic>GSK3B</italic> gene expression, and negatively correlated with <italic>LEF-1</italic>, <italic>WNT10B</italic>, and <italic>COL1A1</italic> mRNA. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that AGEs accumulation is associated with impaired Wnt signaling and low bone turnover in T2D. We did not find any abnormalities in histomorphometric parameters in our subjects with T2D, consistent with our previous report [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>]. Reduced osteoid thickness and osteoblast number were reported in premenopausal T2D women with poor glycemic control compared to non-diabetic subjects but not in the group with good glycemic control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>]. Therefore, good glycemic control appears to prevent or rescue any changes in static histologic parameters of bone turnover that might be caused by uncontrolled diabetes.</p>
<p>Our study has some limitations. One is the cross-sectional design; another one is the relatively small number of T2D subjects enrolled. Moreover, we measured the mRNA abundance of the genes of interest, and we cannot assume that the differences we found reflect differences in protein abundance. Although osteoarthritis may affect some of the genes we studied [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>], all study subjects were affected by variable degree of osteoarthritis, and the effect of such potential confounder is not likely to be different between T2D and control subjects. Finally, we did not use the tetracycline double-labeled technique to investigate dynamic bone parameters.</p>
<p>The main strength of our study is that this study is the first to explore the association of AGEs on Wnt pathway in postmenopausal T2D women. Moreover, we measured the expression of several Wnt genes directly on bone samples of postmenopausal T2D women.</p>
<p>In conclusion, our data show that, despite good glycemic control, T2D decreases expression of <italic>COL1A1</italic> and Wnt genes that regulate bone turnover, in association with increased AGEs content and reduced bone strength. These results may help understand the mechanisms underlying bone fragility in T2D.</p>

<p>This study provides <bold>valuable</bold> insights into understanding bone fragility in T2D patients through the use of human skeletal tissue, reinforcing previous pre-clinical studies or observational studies using serum samples that the Wnt signaling pathway may play a critical role in T2D-related bone impairment. The methods are <bold>solid</bold>, but a limited number of subjects and a small set of genes with lack of data in terms of cellular properties of skeletal tissue are viewed as weaknesses.</p>

<p>Summary: Leanza et al. investigated the regulation of Wnt signaling factors in the bone tissue obtained from individuals with or without type 2 diabetes. They showed that typical canonical Wnt ligands and downstream factors (Wnt10b, LEF1) are down-regulated, while Wnt5a and sclerostin mRNA is unregulated in diabetic bone tissue. Further, Wnt5a and sclerostin associated with the content of AGEs and SOST mRNA levels also correlated with glycemic control and disease duration.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>- A strength of the study is the investigation of Wnt signaling in bone tissue from humans with type 2 diabetes. Most studies measure only serum levels of Wnt inhibitors, but this study takes it further and looks into bone specifically.</p>
<p>
- The measurement of AGEs and its correlation to the Wnt signaling molecules is interesting and important. The correlation of sclerostin and Wnt5a with AGEs and disease duration suggests that inhibited Wnt signaling is paralleled by higher AGE levels and potentially weaker bone.</p>
<p>
- The methodology in terms of obtaining the bone samples and the rigorous evaluation of RNA integrity is great and provides a solid basis for further analyses.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>- A weakness may include the rather limited number of samples.</p>
<p>Overall, this study validates findings from the group that have reported similar findings in 2020. This validates their methodology and shows that alterations in Wnt signaling are reproducible in human bone tissue.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This study reports the levels of expression of selected genes implicated in Wnt signaling in trabecular bone from femur heads obtained after surgery from post-menopausal women with (15 women) or without (21 women) type 2 diabetes. They find higher expression levels of SOST and WNT5A, and lower expression levels of LEF-1 and WNT10B in tissues from subjects with T2D, correlating with glycemia and advanced glycation products. No significant differences in bone density were observed. Overall, this is a cross-sectional, observational study measuring a limited set of genes found to vary with glycemia in postmenopausal women undergoing hip surgery.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The study demonstrates the feasibility of measuring gene expression in post-surgical trabecular bon samples and finds differences associated with glycemia despite a relatively small number of subjects. It can form the basis for further research on the causes and consequences of changes in elements of the WNT signaling pathway in bone biology and disease.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The small number of targeted genes does not provide a comprehensive view of the transcriptional landscape within which the effects are observed. The gene expression changes are not associated with cellular or physiological properties of the tissue, raising questions about the biological significance of the observations.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>We apology for the oversight in the description of the statistical analysis and we thank the reviewer for the careful reading. For sample size calculation of bone histomorphometry we used the cohort of the only paper analyzing trabecular bone in T2D postmenopausal women by dynamic histomorphometry (Manavalan JS et al, JCEM 2012). We performed a priori sample size calculation using G*Power 3.1.9.7., based on the t-test, difference between two independent groups setting. Analysis demonstrated that given an effect size of 2.2776769, we needed a total of 12 patients (6/group) to reach a power of 0.978. Regarding gene expression analyses, it was performed not in a subset of patients, but in all recruited subjects for this study. Based on the results of gene expression analysis on our main outcome (Wnt signaling), we demonstrated that for SOST gene the effect size was 1.2733824, with a power of 0.9490065, confirming that sample size was sufficient to achieve adequate statistical power.</p>

<list-item><p>Why is the number of samples different for the mRNA measurements? In most cases, there were 9, but in some 8 and in some 10?</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>We sincerely thank the reviewer for the opportunity to clarify such important aspects. The number of samples used for mRNA quantification may differ between the different analyzed genes due to multiple reasons: First, we used for the real-time PCR only samples with high quality ratio (260/280) between 1.8-2.0 as stated in the method section of the manuscript (Page 8, lines 163-164). Moreover, we decided not to use the undetermined values, undetectable after the amplification cycles (40 cycles in total), as specified in the method section (Page 8, line 167).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Overall, this study validates findings from the group that reported similar findings in 2020. This validates their methodology and shows that alterations in Wnt signaling are reproducible in human bone tissue.</p>

<p>(1) The authors could provide more details on how much of the bone was analyzed for bone histomorphometry (what area?).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We truly thank the reviewer for allowing us to explain more in depth our methodology. First, a biopsy containing trabecular bone from the femoral head was fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for 24 h prior to storage in 70% ethanol. Tissues were embedded in methylmethacrylate and sectioned sagittally by the Washington University Musculoskeletal Histology and Morphometry Core. Sections were stained with Goldner’s trichrome. Then, a rectangular region of interest containing trabecular bone was chosen below the cartilage-lined joint surface and primary spongiosa. This region had an average dimension of 45 mm2. Tissue processing artifacts, such as folding and edges, were excluded from the ROI. A threshold was chosen using the BIOQUANT software to automatically select trabeculae and measure bone volume. Finally, Osteoid was highlighted in the software and quantified semi-automatically using a threshold and correcting with the brush tool (as shown in the image below).</p>
<p>We specify that in the methods section (Page 7, lines 146-152).</p>

<p>(2) Could the number of samples used for histomorphometry be increased? That may also lead to more significant results.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We sincerely appreciated this suggestion from the reviewer but unfortunately, all available samples for histomorphometry have been analyzed and we are not able to increase the number of recruited participants at this time. Recruitment of people with T2D undergoing hip replacement is extremely difficult giving the limited number of those approved for elective surgery and compliant with our inclusion criteria. Considering also the long time needed to process bone sample for gene expression and histology analysis would require several months to have a consistent increase in recruited subjects. However, we have previously calculated sample size for bone histomorphometry analysis using the only available data of trabecular bone in T2D postmenopausal women measured by dynamic histomorphometry (Manavalan JS et al, JCEM 2012). We performed a priori sample size calculation using G*Power 3.1.9.7., based on the t-test of two independent groups. Analysis demonstrated that given an effect size of 2.2776769, we needed a total of 12 patients (6/group) to reach a power of 0.978.</p>

<p>(3) It would have been interesting to assess the biomechanical behavior of the bone specimens. While it is known that BMD is often higher in patients with T2D, the resistance to fractures is lower. Ideally, bone strength measures could be correlated with Wnt molecule expression and AGEs.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the reviewer that the assessment of biomechanical parameters in our cohort would increase the importance of this study, giving more insights on the effect of downregulation of Wnt signaling on bone strength. Thus, we followed reviewer suggestion, and we performed bone compression tests on trabecular bone core. We found a significant decrease in bone plasticity of T2D compared to controls [Young’s Modulus 21.6 (13.46-30.10 MPa) vs. 76.24 (26.81-132.9 MPa); p=0.0025).  We added results of bone compression test in a new paragraph (Page 8, lines 191-194). In order to assess the validity of our results, we performed a post-hoc power calculation using G*Power 3.1.9.7. We demonstrated that effect size was 1.4716626, with a power of 0.9730784, confirming that sample size was sufficient to achieve adequate statistical power. We added methods in the related section and biomechanical data in table 3; we modified the manuscript accordingly (modifications are shown in track changes). Moreover, we also performed correlation analysis between Wnt target genes, AGEs and biomechanical parameters showing significant correlations as reported in the added paragraph in the results section (Page 11, Lines 225-233).</p>

<p><bold>REVIEWER #2</bold></p>
<p>This study reports the levels of expression of selected genes implicated in Wnt signaling in trabecular bone from femur heads obtained after surgery from post-menopausal women with (15 women) or without (21 women) type 2 diabetes. They found higher expression levels of SOST and WNT5A, and lower expression levels of LEF-1 and WNT10B in tissues from subjects with T2D, correlating with glycemia and advanced glycation products. No significant differences in bone density were observed. Overall, this is a cross-sectional, observational study measuring a limited set of genes found to vary with glycemia in postmenopausal women undergoing hip surgery.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The study demonstrates the feasibility of measuring gene expression in post-surgical trabecular bone samples, and finds differences associated with glycemia despite a relatively small number of subjects. It can form the basis for further research on the causes and consequences of changes in elements of the WNT signaling pathway in bone biology and disease.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The small number of targeted genes does not provide a comprehensive view of the transcriptional landscape within which the effects are observed. The gene expression changes are not associated with cellular or physiological properties of the tissue, raising questions about the biological significance of the observations.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for the comment. Replying to his/her concerns we have increased the number of Wnt target genes including more interactors of Wnt/β-catenin pathway. We measured GSK3B, AXIN2, BETA-CATENIN and SFRP5 gene expression levels, showing a significant increase in GSK3B, in line with a downregulation of Wnt signaling in T2D. We modified the manuscript accordingly with this new analysis and updated the figure 1 panel (Page 10, lines 210-213). Unfortunately, in this paper we were not able to perform experiments on cellular or physiological properties. However, in order to analyze the biological effect of the analyzed genes on the phenotype, we measured bone strength by performing compression tests on trabecular bone cores (Page 10, lines 201-203 and table 3) and used biomechanical parameters for correlation analysis with targeted genes showing significant correlations of bone strength and Wnt genes. We modified adding a new paragraph in the result section and a new figure panel to the main manuscript (Page 11, lines 225-233 and figure 4).</p>

<p>COMMENTS:</p>
<p>(1) The small number of targeted genes does not provide a comprehensive view of the transcriptional landscape within which the effects are observed. Given the author's success in obtaining good-quality RNA from trabecular bone, a more comprehensive exploration would greatly improve the quality of the study.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the reviewer that increase the transcriptional landscape related to Wnt signaling would be of interest for this work and we really thank for this opportunity. We were able to increase the number of Wnt target genes including more interactors of Wnt/β-catenin pathway, using the same cohort of patients in which we performed the other analysis. We also measured GSK3B, AXIN2, BETA-CATENIN and SFRP5 gene expression levels, showing a significant increase in GSK3B, in line with a downregulation of Wnt signaling in T2D. We modified the manuscript accordingly with this new analysis and updated the figures panel (Page 10, lines 210-213 and Figure 1).</p>

<p>(2) The gene expression changes are not associated with cellular or physiological properties of the tissue, raising questions about the biological significance of the observations. Can the authors perform immunohistochemistry to associate the changes in gene expression with protein expression?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We sincerely acknowledge this comment for focusing the attention on a such important aspect. We have partially replied to this comment in the previous paragraph. Regarding immunohistochemistry analysis, it is not possible to further use the available samples. This is mainly due to the fact that non-decalcified bones were embedded in plastic to allow for separate analysis of newly formed osteoid and mineralized bone. This process leads to poor antigen preservation and unsuitable detection of most targets. Moreover, antibodies for Wnt are also unreliable due to the secreted nature of the protein. Overall, this approach is unlikely to work efficiently.  Similarly, RNAscope is not possible due to the resin. Optimization and validation of these analyses will need to be saved for a future study with fresh specimens.</p>

<p><bold>REVIEWER #3</bold></p>
<p>The manuscript by Leanza and colleagues explores the regulation of Wnt signaling and its association with advanced glycation end products (AGEs) accumulation in postmenopausal women with type 2 diabetes (T2D). The paper provides valuable insights into the potential mechanisms underlying bone fragility in individuals with T2D. Overall, the manuscript is well-structured, and the methodology is sound. I would suggest some minor revisions to improve clarity.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The study addresses an important and clinically relevant question concerning the mechanisms underlying bone fragility in postmenopausal women with T2D.</p>
<p>The study's methodology appears sound, and the inclusion of postmenopausal women with and without T2D undergoing hip arthroplasty adds to the clinical relevance of the findings. Additionally, measuring gene expression and AGEs in bone samples provides direct insights into the study's objectives.</p>

<p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion, and we modified the title giving specific information on the main findings of this study. The new title is “Bone canonical Wnt signaling is downregulated in type 2 diabetes and associates with higher Advanced Glycation End-products (AGEs) content and reduced bone strength”.

<p>Introduction: the introduction would benefit from the addition of a clearer, more focused statement of the research questions or hypotheses guiding this study.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for this opportunity and we reformulated the hypothesis of this study based on our data and new findings as follow:” we hypothesized that T2D and AGEs accumulation downregulate Wnt canonical signaling and negatively affect bone strength”. (page 6, lines 116-117).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Methods: more information is needed on the hystomorphometry analysis. Surgical samples from 8 T2D and 9 non-diabetic subjects were used for histomorphometry analysis. How did these subjects compare with the other subjects in the T2D and control groups? Were they representative? How were they selected?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for the opportunity to clarify this important point. The number of subjects included in the different analysis of the paper differ for multiple reasons.
In particular, we used only bone specimen with enough trabecular bone material adequate to perform histomorphometry analysis. Therefore, the samples used in the histomorphometry analysis belong to the same subjects enrolled in the study and analyzed for the other experiments of this paper. However, we have previously calculated sample size for bone histomorphometry analysis using the only available data of trabecular bone in T2D postmenopausal women measured by dynamic histomorphometry (Manavalan JS et al, JCEM 2012). We performed a priori sample size calculation using G*Power 3.1.9.7., based on the t-test of two independent groups.
