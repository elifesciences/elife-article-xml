<abstract>
<title>Abstract</title><p>Genes are often regulated by multiple enhancers. It is poorly understood how the individual enhancer activities are combined to control promoter activity. Anecdotal evidence has shown that enhancers can combine sub-additively, additively, synergistically, or redundantly. However, it is not clear which of these modes are more frequent in mammalian genomes. Here, we systematically tested how pairs of enhancers activate promoters using a three-way combinatorial reporter assay in mouse cells. By assaying about 69,000 enhancer-enhancer-promoter combinations we found that enhancer pairs generally combine near-additively. This behaviour was conserved across seven developmental promoters tested. Surprisingly, these promoters scale the enhancer signals approximately following a power-law, but the exponent of this response varies between promoters. A housekeeping promoter showed an overall different response to enhancer pairs, and a smaller dynamic range. Thus, our data indicate that enhancers mostly act additively, but promoters transform their collective effect non-linearly.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<sec id="s1a">
<title>Enhancers: background</title>
<p>Enhancers are DNA elements, typically a few hundred base pairs long, that bind transcription factors (TFs) and boost the activity of genes <italic>in cis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Banerji et al., 1981</xref>). Over the past decades, many insights have been obtained into the molecular architecture of enhancers, the roles of TFs and their cofactors, the interplay of these factors with chromatin, and the diversity of mechanisms that govern the interactions of enhancers with promoters (S. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Kim &amp; Wysocka, 2023</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s1b">
<title>MPRAs to probe enhancers</title>
<p>In recent years, massively parallel reporter assays (MPRAs) have been developed to systematically dissect the sequence features that determine the functionality of regulatory elements by probing thousands or even millions of DNA elements in a multiplexed manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Inoue &amp; Ahituv, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Klein et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Gallego Romero &amp; Lea, 2023</xref>). Among others, two-way combinatorial MPRA studies that tested a large number of enhancer - promoter pairs revealed a variable degree of intrinsic compatibility between enhancers and promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Zabidi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bergman et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Martinez-Ara et al., 2022</xref>), in line with earlier evidence from analyses of single genomic loci (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bertolino &amp; Singh, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Chang et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Vakoc et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Jing et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Deng et al., 2012</xref>).</p>

<title>Modes of enhancer interplay are still poorly understood</title>
<p>Surveys of mammalian genomes suggest that there are many more enhancers than genes (ENCODE <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Project Consortium, 2012</xref>). Indeed, genes are frequently controlled by multiple enhancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Shlyueva et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Gasperini et al., 2020</xref>; S. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Kim &amp; Wysocka, 2023</xref>). Often, such enhancers are clustered and jointly regulate a nearby tissue-specific gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Tuan et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Grosveld et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Tolhuis et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Deng et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Hnisz et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Whyte et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Hay et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Schoenfelder &amp; Fraser, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Brosh et al., 2023</xref>). However, how multiple enhancers act together to control a single promoter is still poorly understood. Several studies have found that enhancers can combine either additively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Bothma et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Lam et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Dukler et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Hay et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Will et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Lin et al., 2022</xref>), supra-additively/synergistically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Bothma et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Lam et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Joo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Shin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Carleton et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Thomas et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Lin et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Brosh et al., 2023</xref>) or sub-additively/redundantly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Moorthy et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Osterwalder et al., 2018</xref>). Nevertheless, all of these studies tested only small numbers of enhancers in one or a few genomic loci. Therefore, it is still unclear what the globally predominant mode of functional interaction is between enhancers, and how this may depend on the target promoter. For this, more scalable approaches are needed. Here, we report such an approach.</p>

<sec id="s1d">
<title>Systematic approach</title>
<p>To systematically assess enhancer-enhancer interplay and the collective effect on promoter activity, we designed a three-way combinatorial MPRA based on our previous combinatorial reporters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Martinez-Ara et al., 2022</xref>). This assay allowed us to test tens of thousands of enhancer-enhancer-promoter combinations in a uniform setting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Inoue &amp; Ahituv, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">van Arensbergen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Martinez-Ara et al., 2022</xref>). In order to test how different promoters might affect the enhancer interplay and their output, we not only varied enhancer pairs, but also the identity of the promoter in the three-way combinations.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s1e">
<title>Results and significance</title>
<p>By testing about 69,000 enhancer-enhancer-promoter combinations in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) we found that pairs of enhancers mostly combine near-additively. Furthermore, promoter choice affects this enhancer-enhancer interplay, and promoters integrate the enhancer effects in a non-linear manner. Our three-way combinatorial approach provides further insights into two key aspects of gene regulation: how enhancers combine their effects, and how promoters integrate enhancer signals.</p>

<title>Model system and promoter selection</title>
<p>For these experiments we chose mESCs as a model. We selected eight promoters that are active in mESCs. Of these, seven are from tightly regulated genes that are involved in the control of the pluripotency state of the cells or their exit from this state (<italic>Klf2, Sox2, Nanog, Otx2, Lefty1, Ffg5, Tbx3</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Acampora et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Dunn et al., 2014</xref>; D.-K. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Kim et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Thomas et al., 2021</xref>). In addition, we included the promoter of the housekeeping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Hounkpe et al., 2021</xref>) gene <italic>Ap1m1</italic>, which neighbours the <italic>Klf2</italic> gene. From each promoter we approximately included the −350- to +50-bp region around the transcription start site (TSS), because this includes the most information-rich part of functional promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Martinez-Ara et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">van Arensbergen et al., 2017</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2a3">
<title>Clusters of enhancers selection</title>
<p>We selected clusters of enhancers that are either known to regulate the above promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Blinka et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Thomas et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Zuin et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Brosh et al., 2023</xref>), or are candidates for such function because of their proximity to the respective promoters (See methods and <bold>Supplementary Table 1</bold>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Hnisz et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Whyte et al., 2013</xref>). We also included putative enhancers from two additional developmental genes from the core pluripotency network (<italic>Pou5f1 and Nodal</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Dunn et al., 2014</xref>) that are located elsewhere in the genome.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2a4">
<title>Definition and selection of single enhancers</title>
<p>We defined single enhancers as ∼400 bp elements overlapping with DNase hypersensitive sites (DHSs) in clusters of enhancers (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1C-D</xref></bold>), as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Martinez-Ara et al., 2022</xref>). Some of these enhancer clusters could be considered as single large enhancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Long et al., 2016</xref>). However, since DHSs have been shown to retain enhancer activity individually (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Barakat et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Agrawal et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bergman et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Martinez-Ara et al., 2022</xref>) we decided to test the combinatorial contributions of these smaller elements of an enhancer cluster. In total we selected 59 of such single enhancers. We also included 20 random sequences as negative controls (See Methods, <bold>Supplementary Table 2</bold>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2a5">
<title>Cloning of libraries</title>
<p>We cloned each promoter separately into the reporter assay vector. We then barcoded the 8 separate vectors (see Methods). Next, we randomly combined enhancers and controls into pairs and cloned them into the eight different barcoded vectors downstream of the promoters (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig1A</xref> and <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig S1A</xref></bold>). This generated eight different EEP combinatorial libraries, one per promoter, with a total combinatorial space of 49,928 (8 promoters x 79 enhancers and controls x 79 enhancers and controls) or 199,712 if we consider the four possible orientation/position combinations of each enhancer or control fragment (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig1A</xref></bold>). Of this space, the libraries covered 138,528 (69%) of the total combinatorial space, and after application of stringent quality filters (see Methods) we were able to determine activities of 110,180 (55%) combinations (<bold>Supplementary table 3</bold>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2a6">
<title>Explanation of library design</title>
<p>The design of the libraries generates eight matrices, one per promoter. These contain three types of combinations (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>):</bold> control-control (CC), enhancer-control (EC, regardless of position), and enhancer-enhancer (EE), which can be from the same or a different enhancer cluster. Control-control combinations are necessary to measure the baseline activity of each promoter. Enhancer-control combinations are used to estimate the effects of single enhancers. In total, we measured 2,584 control-control combinations, 38,390 enhancer-control combinations, and 69,206 enhancer-enhancer combinations.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2a7">
<title>Library transfections</title>
<p>We transfected each library separately into mESCs, with three biological replicates performed on different days. RNA was extracted and barcodes were counted by sequencing as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Martinez-Ara et al., 2022</xref>) both from RNA and from the plasmid libraries. We calculated the activity of each barcode as the ratio between barcode counts in cDNA and plasmid DNA. We then averaged barcode activities for each triple combination across a minimum of 5 barcodes. For these averaged activities, all developmental promoter libraries showed high correlations between replicates (Pearson’s R = 0.82 to 0.96) (<bold><xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2</xref></bold>). The housekeeping promoter library showed somewhat lower correlations between replicates (Pearson’s R = 0.74 to 0.78), which is most likely due to a smaller dynamic range. For further analyses, we then averaged the biological replicates for each promoter.</p>

<title>Calculation of boost indices</title>
<p>In order to quantify the activation by each enhancer we first calculated the baseline activity of each promoter, defined as the median activity across all control-control combinations. Then, for each individual enhancer-promoter combination, we calculated the median activity across all enhancer-control combinations. For each single enhancer we then calculated a boost index, which is the log<sub>2</sub> ratio of its median activity across enhancer-control combinations over the promoter baseline across control-control combinations <bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref></bold>). We observed that there was little position and orientation dependence of the enhancer effects (<bold><xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figure S3</xref></bold>). We therefore averaged the boost indices of single enhancers across positions and orientations for further analyses.</p>

<title>Selected DHSs are active enhancers</title>
<p>The single enhancer boost indices show that the majority of the sequences that we selected indeed act as enhancers, although the boost indices varied up to ∼5 log<sub>2</sub> units (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A-B</xref></bold>). All tested enhancers showed significant activation of at least one promoter (at an estimated false discovery rate (FDR) &lt; 0.01) (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B, D</xref></bold>). However, the dynamic ranges and effects of each enhancer vary per promoter, with the boost indices being particularly smaller for the housekeeping promoter (<italic>Ap1m1</italic>) (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A, C</xref></bold>). We conclude that most DHSs that we selected from the enhancer clusters act individually as enhancers.</p>

<sec id="s2b3">
<title>Promoter selectivity of enhancers</title>
<p>In our previous study of a large set of E-P pairs we found that the majority of tested enhancers exhibited significant preference for certain promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Martinez-Ara et al., 2022</xref>). Applying the same statistical analysis to the current enhancer set confirmed this finding: the variability of enhancer effects across promoters are generally larger than what is expected from experimental noise (<bold><xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figure S4</xref></bold>). This indicates that the single enhancers tested here show significant promoter selectivity.</p>

<title>Additive model fits better than multiplicative model</title>
<p>We then asked how the effects of two single enhancers are integrated in the enhancer-enhancer (EE) combinations. We considered two simple models: additivity and multiplicativity. For each EE combination we calculated the expected effect according to each of these models based on the single enhancer measurements, and then compared the observed and expected activities (additive in <bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D-E</xref></bold>, multiplicative in <bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref></bold>, see Methods). Interestingly, for most of the promoters the additive model consistently showed a better fit to the measured data than the multiplicative model (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E-F</xref>, <xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Figure S5</xref></bold>). In particular, the multiplicative model tended to strongly overestimate activities at the higher range of activities (most active enhancers) for most promoters. When focusing on EE combinations for which the multiplicative and additive expected values differ more than 0.5 log<sub>2</sub> units (to limit random noise effects), we found that the multiplicative model matched the observed values better for only 0-17% EE combinations across the seven promoters. Only for the <italic>Ap1m1</italic> promoter the multiplicative and additive models were nearly indistinguishable. This may be due to the low dynamic range of activities observed with this promoter. We note that for the <italic>Fgf5</italic> promoter in the low activity ranges the expected activities were consistently underestimated for both models. It is likely that this is an inaccuracy due to the relative sparseness of the <italic>Fgf5</italic> data (the baseline activity of this promoter was estimated from only 23 measured control-control combinations, compared to 219-477 combinations for the other promoters). In summary, we conclude that a simple additive model fits the observed data better than a multiplicative model.</p>

<title>Supra-additivity occurs more frequently with weak promoters</title>
<p>Nevertheless, <bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref></bold> suggests that deviations from the additive model may vary between promoters. The <italic>Sox2</italic>, <italic>Lefty1</italic>, <italic>Tbx3</italic> and <italic>Fgf5</italic> promoters showed a relatively large proportion of EE pairs with supra-additive effects, while the <italic>Ap1m1</italic> promoter exhibited the lowest frequency of supra-additivity. Interestingly, the proportion of supra-additivity correlates inversely with promoter baseline expression (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref></bold>, left panel). Thus, lowly active promoters allow more supra-additive EE interactions, although these remain a minority (&lt;40% of EE pairs). In contrast, the proportion of sub-additive effects (i.e., &gt;1 SD below expected activity) is very similar across promoters (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref> right</bold>). This latter observation suggests that there is no strong saturation effect that could explain the decrease in number of supra-additive interactions as promoter activity increases.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2d3">
<title>EE synergies are relatively infrequent and often promoter-dependent</title>
<p>Next, we investigated whether supra-additivity involves a specific subset of enhancers. Visual inspection identified a few individual enhancers that exhibited supra-additive interactions with most other enhancers, but often in the context of particular promoters. An example is Nodal_E160 in combination with the <italic>Fgf5</italic> promoter (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref></bold>, left panel). Other enhancers showed a diversity of supra-additive activities. Out of the 58 tested enhancers 32.7% (19/58) showed consistent supra-additivity in at least one promoter context (&gt;0.5 log<sub>2</sub>(observed/expected), mean over all enhancers in at least one promoter context), and only 10.3% (6/58) showed consistent supra-additivity in two or more promoter contexts (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref></bold>). However, most enhancers behave like Sox2_E180 (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref></bold>, right panel), showing small deviations from the additive behaviour with most other enhancers, and with all of the tested promoters (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref></bold>).</p>

<title>No evidence for locus-specific EE supra-additivity</title>
<p>We then asked whether enhancer pairs derived from the same genomic locus have a higher propensity towards supra-additivity than those not derived from the same locus. This could point towards co-evolution of enhancers that jointly control a gene. However, we found that EE combinations from the same locus showed on average not a higher observed/expected ratio (according to the additive model) than EE combinations from different loci; in fact, this ratio is even slightly lower (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>)</bold>. Thus, generally there appears to be no preferential synergy among enhancers that are located in the same genomic locus.</p>

<title>Enhancer effects correlate well across developmental promoters</title>
<p>Prompted by our observations that some supra-additive EE interactions appear to be more pronounced in the context of specific promoters, we decided to systematically compare the boost indices of all EE pairs between the eight promoters. Strikingly, all seven developmental promoters showed strong pairwise correlations of their boost indices (Pearson’s R = 0.79 to 0.98), whereas the housekeeping promoter (<italic>Ap1m1</italic>) correlated much less with each of the developmental promoters (Pearson’s R = 0.19 to 0.60; <bold><xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Figure S6</xref></bold>).</p>

<title>Slopes of promoter boost responses differ</title>
<p>Although the developmental promoters showed strong correlations, we were surprised to notice that the slopes of these relationships often deviated from 1. To further explore this, we plotted the boost indices of each promoter against the average boost indices across all eight promoters (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref></bold>). All of the developmental promoters correlated strongly with this average pattern (Pearson’s R= 0.93 to 0.99) but this was not the case for the housekeeping promoter (Pearson’s R= 0.42). The slopes relative to the averaged promoters ranged from 1.54-0.32, i.e., about 5-fold, across the developmental promoters. These results imply that the developmental promoters differ in the scaling (i.e., steepness) of their responses to the set of EE pairs, even though the pattern of their responses is highly similar. Interestingly, the relative slopes negatively correlate with the baseline activity of these promoters (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref></bold>). Thus, promoters with low intrinsic activity respond more steeply to changes in combined EE activity than promoters with high intrinsic activity.</p>

<title>A large-scale survey of EEP combinations</title>
<p>Here, we employed a MPRA approach to measure three-way regulatory interactions in ∼69,000 EEP combinations involving 8 promoters and 59 enhancers. This is of a much larger scale than previous efforts to elucidate the combinatorial interplay among enhancers, which typically focused on a handful of enhancers in single genomic loci (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Bothma et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Hay et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Shin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Dukler et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Joo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Lam et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Carleton et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Moorthy et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Osterwalder et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Thomas et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Lin et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Brosh et al., 2023</xref>). These previous studies pointed to a diversity of functional enhancer-enhancer (EE) interactions, including redundancy, additivity and synergy. Our study also uncovered a broad spectrum of functional interactions, but simple near-additive effects of EE combinations were predominant, while supra-additive interactions occurred at a lower frequency and were dependent on the specific enhancer and promoter context.</p>

<sec id="s3b">
<title>Promoters &quot;interpret&quot; and scale EE interplay</title>
<p>An important finding is that promoters can have substantial impact on supra-additivity of enhancer-enhancer interactions. Promoters may thus be seen as &quot;interpreters&quot; of EE combinations. This underscores the importance of studying triple combinations of elements, and perhaps in the future even more complex settings. A salient finding is that the different promoters show different degrees of responsiveness to EE pairs. The responses of the promoters follow roughly a power-law function of which the exponent is dependent on the promoter (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5A</xref> and <xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">S6</xref></bold>, which are on log-log scale). Because it is not possible to define an absolute measure of enhancer strength, we cannot determine the absolute values of the exponents of the promoter power-law responses. This would be of interest because exponents &lt;1 would lead to &quot;diminishing returns&quot; with higher EE activities, while exponents &gt;1 would correspond to increasing non-linear amplification with higher EE activities. The apparent saturation observable at high enhancer activities in <bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref></bold> suggests that the exponents are most likely below 1.</p>

<sec id="s3c">
<title>Episomal MPRAs vs genomic context</title>
<p>The reporters in our MPRA were not integrated into the genome. On the one hand, this ensures that all EEP combinations are tested under similar conditions, without confounding effects of variable chromatin contexts. On the other hand, we cannot rule out that the results are not fully representative of a natural chromatin environment. However, other studies have indicated that transiently transfected reporters generally behave quite similar, although not identically, to integrated reporters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Inoue &amp; Ahituv, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Klein et al., 2020</xref>), and another study indicated that chromatin context can scale transcriptional activity of inserted reporters in a simple linear manner that is largely independent of the inserted sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Maricque et al., 2018</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s3d">
<title>Results may be biased by model system</title>
<p>We cannot rule out that our results are biased by our selection of enhancers and promoters, which was mostly focused on genes linked to pluripotency in mouse ESCs. We may have missed more prominent synergistic or other non-additive effects that may arise in different cell types or among different classes of enhancers and promoters. However, the protocol that we developed for three-way MPRAs should be generally applicable to any set of enhancers and promoters.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s3e">
<title>Spacing of elements</title>
<p>It should also be considered that in our MPRA the enhancer and promoter elements are placed in fixed positions and close to one another, which does not recapitulate their relative positioning in the genome. Genomic distance and chromatin contexts could act as thresholds for activation, or turn additive interactions into non-linear relationships. For instance, the ability of a <italic>Sox2</italic> enhancer to activate its cognate promoter was found to depend on their distance, following approximately a power law (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Zuin et al., 2022</xref>). The rules for EE interplay may also depend on the EE distance or genomic context, as suggested by a recent report indicating that distant pairs of enhancers are more often synergistic than closely spaced enhancers, which tend to act additively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Lin et al., 2022</xref>).</p>

<title>Enhancer - promoter compatibility re-interpreted</title>
<p>In our previous MPRA study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Martinez-Ara et al., 2022</xref>) we found evidence for selectivity of enhancer - promoter functional interactions. However, due to the limited number of enhancer-promoter combinations tested we could not fully disentangle what caused these differences in promoter responses. The data from the eight promoters indicate that there are two intermingled factors that account for differences between promoters. First, distinct classes of promoters show different specificities, as illustrated by the poor correlations between the <italic>Ap1m1</italic> housekeeping promoter and the developmental promoters. Second, promoters scale the input they receive from enhancer pairs differently, as discussed above. It is probable that the compatibility differences we observed in our previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Martinez-Ara et al., 2022</xref>) are a mix of these two phenomena.</p>

<title>Relevance of findings and context</title>
<p>The findings presented here offer insights into two aspects of the gene regulatory process – interplay between enhancers, and promoter integration of the resulting signals – in a more quantitative manner. The near-additivity of enhancers will help us understand how different enhancers may be more or less relevant in different loci. The non-linearity of promoter responsiveness and the effects of promoters on enhancer-enhancer interactions illustrates how some promoters may be more sensitive to activating signals. Thus, it will be useful to quantify promoter responsiveness genome-wide to understand which genes may be more or less sensitive than others to environmental cues or to non-coding mutations. These aspects may be especially relevant for developmentally regulated transcription factors and their target genes, like the ones here studied, as they can be very sensitive to dosage changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Naqvi et al., 2023</xref>).</p>

<p>Each of the selected eight promoters were amplified by PCR and individually inserted by Gibson assembly (#E2611S; New England Biolabs) into the reporter vector.

We purified barcodes by phenol-chloroform extraction and isopropanol precipitation. Barcodes were digested overnight with 80 units of NheI (#R0131S; NEB) and purified by magnetic bead purification (#CPCR-0050; CleanNA). Each promoter vector and barcodes were then ligated in one 100 µl reaction. In each reaction we used 3 µg of digested vector and 2.7 µg digested barcodes, 20 units NheI (#R0131S; NEB), 20 units AvrII, 10 ml of 103 CutSmart buffer, 10 µl of 10 mM ATP, 10 units T4 DNA ligase (#10799009001 Roche). We performed a cycle-ligation of six cycles (10 min at 22 °C and 10 min at 37 °C), followed by 20 min heat-inactivation at 80 °C. Linear barcoded vectors were purified by magnetic beads and digested for 3h with 40 units of XcmI (#R0533S; NEB). Finally barcoded vectors were purified again by gel-purification.</p>
<p>Single enhancers were amplified by PCR from E14tg2a mESC genomic DNA, then purified with magnetic beads (#CPCR-0050, Clean NA) and quantified by Qubit using dsDNA High sensitivity Qubit kit (#Q33231; invitrogen). Single enhancers and random controls were combined in approximately equimolar manner. This pool of elements was end-repaired using End-It DNA End-Repair Kit (#ER0720; Epicentre) and self-ligated using Fast-link ligase (LK0750H; Lucigen). Duplets of 800bp-1000bp were excised from agarose gel, purified (BIO-52059; Bioline), and A-tailed using Klenow HC 3’ → 5’ exo (#M0212L; NEB).</p>
<p>The pool of duplets was ligated to each of the barcoded promoter vectors using Takara ligation kit version 2.1 (#6022; Takara). Ligation products were purified using magnetic bead purification and 2 µl of the ligation were electroporated into 20 µl of electrocompetent e. cloni 10G supreme (#60081-1; Lucigen). To estimate the approximate complexity of the resulting libraries, dilutions of the electroporated bacteria were plated for overnight culture and colonies were counted. We aimed at a minimum of 2 million complexity per library in order to have sufficient expected representation of all possible combinations.</p>
<p>When the estimated complexity of the libraries was not high enough, we amplified the ligation products with primers aligning to the vector. This generated PCR products consisting of the duplets pool and a vector overhang. These PCR products were used for Gibson assembly with the barcoded promoters (#E2611S; NEB). Gibson assembly reactions were purified with magnetic beads and 2 µl of the reaction were electroporated into 20 µl of electrocompetent e. cloni 10G supreme (#60081-1; Lucigen).</p>
<p>Each library was grown overnight in 500 ml of standard Luria Broth (LB) with 50 mg/ml of kanamycin and purified using a maxiprep kit (K210016, Invitrogen).</p>

<title>Characterization of libraries by iPCR and sequencing</title>
<p>Barcode to insert (enhancer and control duplets) combinations were identified by inverse PCR (iPCR) and Illumina sequencing as described before(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">van Arensbergen et al., 2017</xref>). In brief, each library was digested overnight with I-CeuI (#R0699S, NEB), barcode-insert fragments were then circularized, remaining linear fragments digested, and barcode-insert fragments were linearized again with I-SceI (#R0694S; NEB). Barcode-insert fragments were then amplified by PCR with Illumina adapters and sequenced on an Illumina NextSeq 550 platform using 150 bp paired-end sequencing. Each library was processed separately and mixed together for sequencing.</p>

<title>Transfection of libraries</title>
<p>Each EEP library was transfected separately into E14tg2a mESCs. Per library 20 million cells were nucleofected (5µgs of library and 5million cells per cuvette, 5 cuvettes) using Amaxa nucleofector II, program A-30, and Mouse Embryonic Stem Cell NucleofectorTM Kit (#VPH-1001, Lonza). Three biological replicates were performed per library on different days. Cells were collected 24 hours after transfection in 5 ml of TRIsure (#BIO-38032; Bioline) and frozen at -80 °C until further processing.</p>

<title>cDNA sequencing</title>
<p>RNA was extracted and prepared for sequencing as described for the Downstream Assay in our previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Martinez-Ara et al., 2022</xref>). From each sample, the aqueous phase containing the total RNA of the TRIsure solution was extracted and purified on an RNA extraction column (#K0732, Thermo Scientific). Total RNA was digested with 10 units of DNase I (#04716728001; Roche) for 30 minutes in 10-8 10 µl reactions containing 5 µg of RNA. DNase I was inactivated by addition of 1 µl of 25 mM EDTA and incubation at 70°C for 10 min.</p>
<p>cDNA was produced in 20 µl reactions (1 per 10 µDNAse reaction) using Maxima Reverse transcriptase (#EP0743; ThermoFisher Scientific) and a gene specific (targeting the GFP reporter) primer (JvA304, see <bold>Supplementary table 4</bold> for sequence). dNTPs and the primer were mixed with the DNAse digested RNA and incubated at 65°C for 5 minutes. The RT buffer, enzyme and RNAse inhibitor were added and the reaction was incubated at 50 °C for 1 hour. cDNA was then amplified by two nested PCRs to make it strand specific. The first PCR reaction uses (index variants of 285JvA containing the S2, index and p7 adaptor) and 305JvA (targeting the adapter introduced by 304JvA). Each 20 µl RT reaction was amplified in a 100µl PCR reaction with MyTaq Red mix (#BIO-25043; Bioline). The second PCR reaction was performed using 10 µl of the product of the previous reaction in a 100 µl reaction using the same index variant primer and index variants of 437JvA (containing the S1, index and p5 adaptor) (see <bold>Supplementary table 4</bold> for primer sequences). The first PCR was run for 10 cycles and the second one for 8 cycles using the recommended Mytaq Red mix conditions (for both PCRs: 1 min 96 °C, then each cycle 15 s 96 °C, 15 s 60 °C, 15 s 72 °C). PCR products were purified with magnetic beads and mixed for sequencing in an Illumina NovaSeq 6000 platform using 100bp single end reads.</p>

<title>Linking Barcodes to duplet inserts</title>
<p>The custom pipeline for linking barcodes to duplet inserts was previously described {Martinez-ara,2022, 35594855}. In brief, iPCR reads from each library were locally aligned using bowtie (version 2.3.4) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Langmead &amp; Salzberg, 2012</xref>) with very sensitive parameters (–very-sensitive-local) on a custom bowtie genome. This custom Bowtie genome consists of virtual chromosomes that correspond to each of the enhancer and control sequences used to generate the combinatorial libraries. Bam files were processed by a custom Python script (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Van Rossum &amp; Drake, 2009</xref>). This script extracts from read 1 the barcode sequence, and the identity and orientation of the DNA fragment in position 1. From read 2 it extracts the identity and orientation of the DNA fragment in position 2. Finally, barcodes were clustered using Starcode (version 1.1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Zorita et al., 2015</xref>) to remove PCR and sequencing errors.</p>

<p>For each library cDNA and pDNA barcodes were matched to iPCR barcodes. Any barcode assigned to multiple fragment identities was removed from the data. Per cDNA/pDNA replicate barcode counts were normalized to the total number of barcode counts. Then activity was calculated per barcode and cDNA replicate as the cDNA:pDNA normalized counts ratio. Per individual duplet combination these normalized activity ratios were averaged across barcodes with a minimum requirement of five barcodes and eight pDNA counts per barcode. The mean activity across the three replicates was calculated as the geometric mean.</p>

<title>Calculation of boost indices</title>
<p>In our previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Martinez-Ara et al., 2022</xref>) we observed that it was critical to use control sequences to estimate the baseline activity of the promoters. For each promoter we used all of the control-control combinations to estimate its baseline activity. We calculated this as the median activity across all control-control combinations. Then the boost index of an enhancer-enhancer or enhancer-control (single enhancer boost index) combination was calculated as the log<sub>2</sub> ratio between the observed activity of this combination and the baseline activity of the promoter. Except in <bold><xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 3</xref></bold>, boost indices were averaged across positions and orientations. In <bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2a</xref></bold> boost indices were averaged across all enhancer-control combinations for each enhancer. In <bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3a</xref></bold> boost indices were averaged across orientations but not positions.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s5e">
<title>Calculation of additive and multiplicative expected activities</title>
<p>To calculate the expected additive and multiplicative activities we first had to determine three values. The baseline activity of the promoter (A<sub>CCP</sub>) was measured as the median activity across all control-control combinations for each promoter. The single enhancer activity estimates (A<sub>E1CP</sub> and A<sub>CE2P</sub>, enhancer in position1 and position 2 respectively) were calculated as the median activity of all enhancer-control combinations where the enhancer was found in either position 1 (A<sub>E1CP</sub>) or position 2 (A<sub>CE2P</sub>). Therefore</p>
<p>A<sub>CCP</sub> = median{A<sub>C1C2P</sub>, A<sub>C1C3P</sub>, …, A<sub>CiCjP</sub>}</p>
<p>A<sub>E1CP</sub> = median{A<sub>E1C1P</sub>, A<sub>E1C2P</sub>, …, A<sub>E1CiP</sub>}</p>
<p>A<sub>CE2P</sub> = median{A<sub>C1E2P</sub>, A<sub>C2E2P</sub>, …, A<sub>CiE2P</sub>}</p>
<p>Then for each enhancer-enhancer-promoter combination the expected additive activity was calculated as the sum of the estimated activities of the single enhancers in each position minus the promoter baseline activity (A<sub>E1CP</sub> + A<sub>CE2P</sub> – A<sub>CCP</sub>). The multiplicative expected activity was calculated as the product of the estimated activities of the single enhancers in each position divided by the promoter baseline activity ((A<sub>E1CP</sub> * A<sub>CE2P</sub>)/A<sub>CCP</sub>). For the expected additive activity, the standard deviation of the estimate was propagated as the square root of the sum of the variances of the single measurements. Therefore</p>
<p>Expected Additive Activity = (A<sub>E1CP</sub> + A<sub>CE2P</sub> - A<sub>CCP</sub>)</p>
<p>Expected Multiplicative Activity = (A<sub>E1CP</sub> * A<sub>CE2P</sub>)/A<sub>CCP</sub></p>
<p>The additive expected activities were then used to calculate log<sub>2</sub>(observed/expected) ratios in order to find cooperative behaviours between enhancers. To find trends the log<sub>2</sub> ratios were then averaged for each enhancer across enhancer-enhancer pairs.</p>

<title>Non-linear Promoter responses</title>
<p>For every enhancer-enhancer combination present in all eight libraries we averaged boost indices across the eight promoters. This average enhancer effect was then used to calculate the slope between the Average boost index and the observed boost index for each of the promoters. The slopes were calculated using the lm function in R.</p>

<p>This manuscript by Martinez-Ara et al investigates how combinations of cis-regulatory elements combine to influence gene expression. Using a clever iteration on massively parallel reporter assays (MPRAs), the authors measure the combinatorial effects of pairs of enhancers on specific promoters. Specifically, they assayed the activity of 59x59 different enhancer-enhancer (E-E) combinations on 8 different promoters in mouse embryonic stem cells. The main claims of the paper are that E-E pairs combine nearly additively, and that supra-additive E-E pairs are rare and often promoter-dependent. The data in this study generally support these claims.</p>
<p>This paper makes a good contribution to the ongoing discussions about the selectivity of gene regulatory elements. Recent works, such as those by Martinez-Ara et al. and Burgman et al., have indicated limited selectivity between E-P pairs on plasmid-based assays; this paper adds another layer to that by suggesting a similar lack of selectivity between E-E pairs.</p>
<p>An interesting result in this manuscript is the observation that weak promoters allow more supra-additive E-E interactions than strong promoters (Figure 4b). This nonlinear promoter response to enhancers aligns with the model previously proposed in Hong et al. (from my own group), which posited that core promoter activities are nonlinearly scaled by the genomic environment, and that (similar to the trend observed in Figure 5b) the steepness of the scaling is negatively correlated with promoter strength.</p>
<p>My only suggestion for the authors is that they include more plots showing how much the intrinsic strengths of the promoters and enhancers they are working with explain the trends in their data.</p>
<p>Specific Suggestions</p>
<p>
Supplementary Figure 4 is presented as evidence for selectivity between single enhancers and promoters. Could the authors inspect the relationship between enhancer/promoter strength and this selectivity? Generating plots similar to Figure 4B and Figure 5B, but for single enhancers, should show if the ability of an enhancer to boost a promoter is inversely correlated to that promoter's intrinsic strength. Also, in Supplementary Figure 4, coloring each point by promoter type would clarify if certain promoters (the weak ones) consistently show higher boost indices across all enhancers. If they do not, the authors may want to speculate how single enhancers can show selectivity for promoters while the effect of adding a second enhancer to an existing E-P has little selectivity. An alternate explanation, based solely on the strength of the elements, would be that when the expression of a gene is low the addition of enhancer(s) has large effects, but when the expression of a gene is high (closer to saturation) the addition of enhancer(s) have small effects.</p>
<p>Can anything more be said about the enhancers in E-E-P combinations that exhibit supra-additivity? Specifically, it would be interesting to know if certain enhancers, e.g. strong enhancers or enhancers with certain motifs, are more likely to show supra-additivity with a given promoter.</p>

<p>Summary</p>
<p>
This work investigates how multiple regulatory elements combine to regulate gene expression. The authors use an episomal reporter assay which measures the transcriptional output of the reporter under the regulation of an enhancer-enhancer-promoter triple. The authors test all combinations of 8 promoters and 59 enhancers in this assay. The main finding is that enhancer pairs generally combine additively on reporter output. The authors also find that the extent to which enhancers increase reporter output is inversely related to the intrinsic strength of the promoter.</p>
<p>This manuscript presents a compact experiment that investigates an important open question in gene regulation. The results and data will be of interest to researchers studying enhancers. Given that my expertise is in modeling and computation, I will take the experimental results at face value and focus my review on the interpretation of the results and the computational methodology. I find the result of additivity between enhancers to be well supported. The findings on differential responsiveness between promoters are very interesting but the interpretation of such responses as 'non-linear' or 'following a power-law' may be misleading. More broadly, I think a more rigorous description of the mathematical methodology would increase the clarity and accessibility of this manuscript. A major unanswered question is whether the findings in this study apply to enhancers in their native genomic context. Regardless, investigating such questions in an episomal reporter assay is valuable.</p>
<p>Main comments</p>
<p>
Applicability to native genomic context: The applicability of the results in this paper to enhancers in their native genomic context is unclear. As the authors state in the discussion section, the reporter gene is not integrated into the genome, the spacing between enhancers does not match their native context etc. It is thus unclear whether this experimental design is able to detect the non-additivity between enhancers which is known to be present in the genome. This could be investigated by testing the enhancer-enhancer-promoter tuples for which non-additivity has been observed in the genome (references are given in the introduction) in this assay.</p>
<p>Interpretation of promoter responses as non-linear and following a power-law: In Fig 5, the authors demonstrate that enhancer-enhancer pairs boost reporter output more for weak promoters as opposed to strong promoters. I agree the data supports this finding, but I find the interpretation of such data as promoters scaling enhancers according to a power-law (as stated in the abstract) to be misleading. As mentioned on line 297, it is not possible to define an intrinsic measure of enhancer strength, thus the authors assign the base of the power-law to be the average boost index of the enhancer-enhancer pair across the 8 promoters. But this measure incorporates some aspect of a promoter and is not solely a property of enhancers. It would also be useful to know whether the results in Fig 5 apply to only enhancer-enhancer-promoter triples or also to enhancer-promoter pairs.</p>
<p>Enhancer-promoter selectivity: As a follow-up to a previous study (Martinez-Ara et al, Molecular Cell 2022) the authors mention that the data in this study also shows that enhancers show selectivity for certain promoters. The authors mention that both studies use the same statistical methodology and the data in this study is consistent with the data from the 2022 paper. However, I think the statistical methodology in both studies needs further exposition. This section of the review is thus meant to ensure that I understand the author's methodology, to guide the reader in understanding how the authors define 'selectivity', and to probe certain assumptions underlying the methodology.</p>
<p>My understanding of the approach is as follows: The authors consider an enhancer to be not selective if its 'boost index' is the same across a set of promoters. 'Boost index' is defined to be the ratio of the reporter output with the enhancer and promoter divided by the reporter output with just the promoter. Conceptually, I think that considering the boost index is a reasonable way to quantify selectivity.</p>
<p>The authors use a frequentist approach to classify each enhancer as selective or not selective. The null hypothesis is that the boost index of the enhancer is equal across a set of promoters. This can be visualized in Fig. 2C where the null hypothesis is that the mean of each vertical distribution is equal. Note that in Figure S4 of this paper (and in Figure 4B of their 2022 paper) the within-group variance is not plotted. Statistical significance is assessed using a Welch F-test. This is a parametric test that assumes that the observations within each vertical distribution in Fig 2C are normally distributed (this test does allow for heteroskedasticity - which means that the variance may differ within each vertical distribution). Does the normality assumption hold? This analysis should be reported. If this assumption does not hold, is the Welch test well calibrated?</p>
