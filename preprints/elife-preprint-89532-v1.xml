<title>Abstract</title>
<p>During the process of synaptic formation, neurons require not only certain principles for selecting partners to form synapses but also additional mechanisms to avoid undesired cells. However, the means to get around unwanted partners remains largely unknown. In this study, we have identified that the combinatorial expression of clustered protocadherin gammas (γ-PCDHs) is essential in regulating such specificity in the mouse neocortex. Using single-cell sequencing from the 5-prime end, we revealed the combinatorial expression pattern of γ-PCDH variable isoforms in neocortical neurons. Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings demonstrated that increasing the similarity level of this combinatorial pattern in neurons reduced their synaptic connectivity. Our findings reveal a delicate molecular mechanism for assembling the neural network in the mouse neocortex.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The specificity of synaptic connections is essential for the function of neural circuits(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Yogev and Shen, 2014</xref>). Cell adhesion molecules play crucial roles in the specificity of synapse formation(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Duan et al., 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Serizawa et al., 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Tan et al., 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Rawson et al., 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Sytnyk et al., 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Berns et al., 2018</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Jang et al., 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Courgeon and Desplan, 2019</xref>), but how to achieve specificity at the microcircuit level remains to be determined. The unique expression pattern of clustered protocadherins (cPCDH) leads to millions of possible combinations of cPCDH isoforms on the neuron surface(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Kaneko et al., 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Esumi et al., 2005</xref>), suggesting cPCDHs function as a unique barcode for each neuron(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Yagi, 2012</xref>). The absence of γ-PCDH does not cause general abnormality in the development of the cerebral cortex, such as cell differentiation, migration, and survival(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Wang et al., 2002</xref>). However, the presence of γ-PCDH has been detected at the synaptic contacts(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Fernandez-Monreal et al., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Phillips et al., 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">LaMassa et al., 2021</xref>), and its absence has substantial effects on neuronal connectivity(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Tarusawa et al., 2016</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Kostadinov and Sanes, 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Lv et al., 2022</xref>). The homophilic property of γ-PCDH allows them to promote exuberant dendritic complexity(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Molumby et al., 2016</xref>). However, more evidence suggests that it might be detrimental to synapse formation. Previous studies indicated that homophilic interactions mediated by large overlapping patterns of cPCDH isoforms on opposing cell surfaces might lead to intercellular repulsion(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Rubinstein et al., 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Brasch et al., 2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Honig and Shapiro, 2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Lefebvre et al., 2012</xref>), in which the interaction with the neuroligin family may be involved(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Molumby et al., 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Steffen et al., 2021</xref>).</p>
<p>Following this repulsion concept, the absence of γ-PCDH caused significantly more dendritic spines and inhibitory synapse densities in neocortical neurons(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Molumby et al., 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Steffen et al., 2021</xref>). Consistently, neurons with overexpressed one of the γ-PCDH isoforms had significantly fewer dendritic spines from the same condition(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Molumby et al., 2017</xref>). Furthermore, the absence of the clustered PCDH also increased local reciprocal neural connection between lineage-related neurons in the neocortex(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Tarusawa et al., 2016</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Lv et al., 2022</xref>), even though sister cells had more similar expression patterns of γ-PCDH isoforms(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Lv et al., 2022</xref>).</p>
<p>Although γ-PCDH has these “contradictory” effects on dendrites’ complexity and dendritic spines, it is detrimental to synapse formation in the forebrain. However, each neuron expresses multiple isoforms of γ-PCDH(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Kaneko et al., 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Lv et al., 2022</xref>). What could be the impact of this combinatorial expression on synapse formation? Here, using 5-prime end (5’-end) single-cell sequencing, we revealed the diversified combinatorial expression of γ-PCDH isoforms in neocortical neurons. With multiple whole-cell patch-clamp recordings after the sequential <italic>in utero</italic> electroporation, we discovered that the combinatorial expression of γ-PCDHs plays a vital role in synaptic specificity to assemble the neural microcircuit in the mouse neocortex. This is achieved by allowing a neuron to choose which partners not to form a synapse with rather than choosing which ones to make synapses with.</p>

<title>The diversified combinatorial expression pattern of γ-PCDHs in neocortical neurons revealed by 5’-end single-cell sequencing</title>
<p>The gamma isoform of cPCDHs (γ-PCDHs) is critical for synaptic connectivity(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Kostadinov and Sanes, 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Tarusawa et al., 2016</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Lv et al., 2022</xref>). To determine the role of γ-PCDH in the neocortex, we examined their expression in the neocortical neurons of postnatal mice. Previous studies have suggested that cPCDHs were stochastically expressed in neurons(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Hirayama et al., 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Toyoda et al., 2014</xref>). Here, we applied a 5’-end single-cell RNA sequencing to identify γ-PCDH isoforms by sequencing their variable exon (exon 1), where they differ from each other(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Kohmura et al., 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Wu and Maniatis, 1999</xref>). Since the second postnatal week is the critical stage for synapse formation in the rodent neocortex(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Lendvai et al., 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Holtmaat and Svoboda, 2009</xref>), we chose postnatal day 11 (P11) to examine their expression. After reverse transcription and cDNA amplification (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>-S1A, B), we split cDNA into two parts: one for specific amplification of <italic>pcdhg</italic> mRNAs and the other for the 5’ gene expression library construction (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>-S1C). After the cluster analysis (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>-S2-4), we collected 6505 neurons out of 17438 cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>-S1D). Neurons with more than 10 UMI (cutoff&gt;1 for each type of individual isoform) for all γ-PCDH (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B, C</xref>) were further analyzed. We found that significantly more cells expressed “C-type” isoforms (C3, C4, and C5) compared to other “variable” isoforms (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>-S1E), which is consistent with a previous study(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Toyoda et al., 2014</xref>). We performed the pair-wise analysis on similarity between neurons in the single-cell expression pattern of γ-PCDH variable isoforms, which revealed that most neocortical neurons had distinct combinatorial expression patterns (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>). Based on the variance analysis(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Wada et al., 2018</xref>) of fraction distribution of the number of the expressed isoforms per cell for all neurons (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>-S5), we found a weak but significant co-occurrence for the expression of γ-PCDH isoforms in most neurons (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1G</xref>). We did not detect any apparent differences among clusters except for cluster 0, which had much less expression (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>) and no co-occurrence of γ-PCDH isoforms (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1G</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>-S5). Since all of our electrophysiological recordings were carried out on pyramidal neurons in the layer 2/3 of the neocortex, we analyzed the corresponding cluster 7 in more detail. They also showed distinct expression patterns as a general population of neocortical neurons (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>-S6). In summary, the data from 5’-end single-cell sequencing reveal that γ-PCDHs are diversely expressed in most neocortical neurons with a combinatorial pattern.</p>

<title>The absence of γ-PCDHs led to an increase in local synaptic connectivity among pyramidal neurons</title>
<p>To investigate the function of γ-PCDH in the synaptic formation between neocortical neurons, we conducted paired recordings on pyramidal neurons in the layer 2/3 of the neocortex from γ-PCDH conditional knockout (cKO) mice. These mice were obtained by crossing <italic>Pcdhg</italic> <sup><italic>flox/flox</italic></sup> mice(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Lefebvre et al., 2008</xref>) with <italic>Nex-cre</italic> mice(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Goebbels et al., 2006</xref>), in which all variable and C-type γ-PCDH isoforms were specifically removed in pyramidal neurons. Using multiple whole-cell patch-clamp recordings from cortical slices of P9-32 mice, we measured the connectivity among nearby pyramidal cells (&lt;50 μm between cell somas) in the layer 2/3 of the neocortex by the presence of evoked monosynaptic responses (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>-S1). As shown in the sample traces in the connectivity matrix from six recorded neurons (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>-S1), two neuronal pairs (the neuronal pairs 4→3 and 5→6) exhibited unidirectional monosynaptic connections (indicated by orange arrows), and one pair (the neuronal pair 1↔3) with bidirectional connection (indicated by green arrows) out of 15 possibilities. Overall, we found that the percentage of connected pairs was significantly higher in <italic>Pcdhg</italic> cKO mice (20.2%, 103/511) than in wild-type (WT) mice (15.0%, 122/813). Due to their potential different roles in the synaptic organizations in the neocortex(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Douglas and Martin, 2004</xref>), we performed an extra set of recordings in the layer 2/3 of the neocortex from P10-20 mice to separate neuron pairs along their axes vertical <italic>vs</italic>. horizontal to the pial surface in <italic>Pcdhg</italic> cKO mice. We found a more significant difference in the connectivity for vertically aligned cells (18.3%, 94/515 in <italic>Pcdhg</italic> cKO mice <italic>vs</italic>. 11.2%, 73/651 in WT mice for vertically aligned neuron pairs; 12.2%, 27/221 in <italic>Pcdhg</italic> cKO mice <italic>vs</italic>. 9.5%, 28/294 in WT mice for horizontally aligned neuron pairs) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>). We also generated <italic>Pcdha</italic> cKO mice (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>-S2-4) and performed the same set of experiments for vertically aligned neurons. We did not find a significant difference (11.3%, 38/337 in <italic>Pcdha</italic> cKO mice <italic>vs</italic>. 14.3%, 26/182 in WT mice, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>) in the mice without α-PCDH. In a more detailed analysis of synaptic connections among vertically aligned neurons in <italic>Pcdhg</italic> cKO mice, we found that the absence of γ-PCDH expression appeared to significantly increase synapse formation between cells separated vertically by 50 to 100 μm (24.0%, 50/208 in <italic>Pcdhg</italic> cKO mice <italic>vs</italic>. 9.6%, 20/208 in WT mice) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref>). Furthermore, we found that the absence of γ-PCDH increased synapse formation starting from P10 (16.1%, 32/199 in <italic>Pcdhg</italic> cKO mice <italic>vs</italic>. 8.7%, 20/230 in WT mice for P10-12; 21.6%, 22/102 in <italic>Pcdhg</italic> cKO mice <italic>vs</italic>. 12.8%, 29/227 in WT mice for P13-15), when chemical synapses between cortical neurons become more detectable, and such tendency maintained for as long as measurements were performed (up to P20) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2F</xref>). Thus, γ-PCDH may play a role in preventing synapse formation starting from the early stage of neural development.</p>

<title>Overexpression of γ-PCDHs decreases local synaptic connectivity in the mouse neocortex</title>
<p>To further determine the effect of γ-PCDHs on synapse formation, we overexpressed randomly selected single or multiple γ-PCDH isoforms tagged with fluorescent proteins through <italic>in utero</italic> electroporation in mice. We then performed multiple whole-cell patch-clamp recordings to address the effect of γ-PCDHs on pair-wise synaptic connectivity for neurons in the layer 2/3 of the neocortex.</p>
<p>To confirm the overexpression effect, we performed the assays of RT-qPCR (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A, B</xref>), single-cell RT-PCR (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C, D</xref>), and immunohistochemistry (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>-S1A to C). The RT-qPCR assay revealed that the electroporated isoforms, but not the non-overexpressed ones, from the surgical side indeed had significantly higher expression levels than those from the contralateral side (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A, B</xref>). To estimate how many isoforms were expressed in a given neuron when multiple plasmids were electroporated, we tagged first five isoforms with mNeongreen and the sixth one with mCherry (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>-S1A). Based on the rates of yellow and red-only cells in the total electroporated neuron population (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>-S1B), the probability analysis revealed that each positive neuron expressed an average of 5.6 types of isoforms (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>-S1C and the top panel of D). This result was consistent with the data from single-cell RT-PCR analysis in which an average of 5.3 types out of 6 electroporated isoforms was detected from 19 neurons (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C, D</xref> and the bottom panel of <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>-S1D). The results from single-cell RT-PCR also suggest that electroporation-introduced isoforms are the dominant ones in these neurons (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>).</p>

<p>Since the layer distribution of neocortical neurons plays a critical role in their synaptic connection(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">He et al., 2015</xref>), we examined their positions relatively to the pial surface after the overexpression. We found that overexpressing γ-PCDH isoforms did not affect cell positions in the neocortex compared to the control plasmids (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>-S1E, F).</p>
<p>We then used multiple recordings to examine the impact of γ-PCDHs on synapse formation. Overexpressing of one or six γ-PCDH variable isoforms in neurons significantly reduced the synaptic connection rate among them (10.3%, 15/146 in expressing control plasmids; 1.9%, 4/216 in overexpressing one isoform; and 4.4%, 8/181 in overexpressing six isoforms, red bars in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E</xref>). However, overexpressing γ-PCDH C4 did not affect the synaptic connection rate (11.3%, 12/106 in overexpressing γ-PCDH C4, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E</xref>). To exclude further the potential effect of C-types of γ-PCDHs’ impacts in synapse formation, we electroporated six variable isoforms in <italic>pcdhg</italic> cKO mice. The overexpression also led to the reduction of the connection rate in <italic>pcdhg</italic> cKO mice (6.1%, 12/198 in overexpressing six isoforms vs. 16.5%, 31/188 in expressing control plasmids), similar to what we observed in WT littermate mice (6.6%, 8/121 in overexpressing six isoforms vs. 16.5%, 18/109 in expressing control plasmids) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3F</xref>). These observations reveal that overexpressing the variables, but not the C-types of γ-PCDHs isoforms, decrease synaptic connectivity in the mouse neocortex.</p>

<title>Combinatorial expression of γ-PCDHs regulates synaptic specificity in the mouse neocortex</title>
<p>To investigate the impact of the combinatorial expression pattern of γ-PCDH isoforms on synapse formation, we conducted a sequential <italic>in utero</italic> electroporation at E14.5 and E15.5 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>). By electroporating the same or different combinations of γ-PCDH variable isoforms on these two days, we aimed to manipulate the expression similarity level between two groups of neurons. Isoforms were randomly selected based on their comparable expression, except for isoforms A5 and B8, which had low expression levels according to the single cell sequencing data (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>-S1E). We assigned their combinations to achieve similarity levels ranging from 0% (no overlap, completely different) to 100% (complete overlap, all identical) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>). We used fluorescent proteins mNeongreen and mRuby3(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Bajar et al., 2016</xref>) to tag isoforms for electroporation at E14.5 and E15.5 respectively (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>). Subsequently, whole-cell patch-clamp recordings were conducted on layer 2/3 neurons in the neocortex from acute brain slices containing both green and red cells from P10-14 pups. Each set of recordings included at least one mNeongreen<sup>+</sup>, one mRuby3<sup>+</sup>, and one nearby control neuron without fluorescence (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>). Our results showed that neurons with the same color exhibited significantly lower connectivity (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>-S1A), which aligns with the findings from single electroporation (as shown in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E</xref>). In the complete overlap (100%) group, the connectivity rate between neurons electroporated at different days was also significantly lower compared to the control (3.7%, 5/134 in the complete-overlap group; 12.5%, 19/151 in control pairs, 100% in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref>). However, as the similarity levels decreased from 100% to 0%, the connectivity probabilities progressively returned to the control level. The likelihood recovered to 8.4% (14/165) for the pairs with a 33% similarity level and 10.3% (12/117) and 10.5% (12/114) for pairs with 11% or 0% similarity level, respectively (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref>). These observations suggested that it is the similarity level of γ-PCDH isoforms between neurons, but not the absolute expression of the protein in individual neurons, that regulate the synaptic formation. Similar to the single electroporation experiment (gray bars in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E</xref>), there were no significant changes in the synaptic connectivity between electroporated and nearby control neurons (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>-S1B). Overall, our findings demonstrate a negative correlation between the probability of forming synaptic connections and the similarity level of γ-PCDH isoforms expressed in neuron pairs (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E</xref>). These findings strongly suggest that the diversified combinatorial expression of γ-PCDH isoforms is crucial for synapse formation between nearby pyramidal cells. The more similar the γ-PCDH isoforms patterns expressed in neurons, the lower the probability of forming synapses between them (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4F</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Homophilic proteins cPCDHs are strong candidates for promoting synaptic specificity due to their combinatorial and stochastic expression pattern(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Yagi, 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Kohmura et al., 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Toyoda et al., 2014</xref>). Our 5’-end single-cell sequencing data provided insights into the combinatorial expression pattern of γ-PCDH isoforms in neocortical neurons. We further demonstrated the critical role of this diversity in synaptic specificity through three lines of evidence. Firstly, the absence of γ-PCDH significantly increased functional connectivity between adjacent neocortical neurons. Secondly, electroporation-induced overexpression of identical γ-PCDH variable isoforms in developing neurons markedly decreased their connectivity. Lastly, using sequential <italic>in utero</italic> electroporation with different batchs of isoforms, we found that increasing the similarity level of γ-PCDH variable isoforms expressed in neurons led to a reduction in their synaptic connectivity. These findings suggest that γ-PCDHs regulate the specificity of synapse formation by preventing synapse formation with specific cells, rather than by selectively choosing particular targets. It remains to be studied whether the diversified patterns of γ-PCDH isoforms expressed in different neurons have additional coding functions for neurons beyond their homophilic interaction.</p>
<p>Previous studies by Molumby et al. demonstrated that neurons from the neocortex of <italic>pcdhg</italic> knockout mice exhibited significantly more dendritic spines, while neurons overexpressing a single γ-PCDH isoforms had fewer dendritic spines in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Molumby et al., 2017</xref>). Our recordings are consistent with these previous morphology studies. Tarusawa et al. revealed that the absence of the whole cluster of cPCDH affected synaptic connections among lineage-related cells(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Tarusawa et al., 2016</xref>). More recently, overexpression of the C-type γ-PCDH isoform C3 also showed a negative effect on synapse formation within a defined clone(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Lv et al., 2022</xref>). In our study, we further demonstrated an increased synaptic connection rate between adjacent pyramidal neurons in the neocortex of <italic>pcdhg</italic> knockout mice, while it decreased between neurons overexpressing single or multiple identical γ-PCDH variable isoforms. These effects were not just limited to lineage-dependent cells. Together with previous findings(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Molumby et al., 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Tarusawa et al., 2016</xref>), our observations solidify the repulsion effect of γ-PCDH on synapse formation among neocortical neurons. Some subtle differences exist between our findings and previous recordings(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Tarusawa et al., 2016</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Lv et al., 2022</xref>). Tarusawa et al. demonstrated that the connection probability between excitatory neurons lacking the entire cPCDH cluster in the layer 4 was approximately twofold higher at early stage P9-11, significantly lower at P13-16, and similar to control cells at P18-20 compared (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Tarusawa et al., 2016</xref>). In our study, <italic>pcdhg</italic><sup>-/-</sup> pyramidal neuronal pairs consistently exhibited a higher connection probability from P10 to P20. Two potential reasons could explain these differences. Firstly, we only removed γ-PCDH instead of the entire cPCDH cluster, which includes α, β, and γ isoforms. Secondly, γ-PCDH might have different functions in neurons located in the layer 2/3 compared to the layer 4. Lv et al. found that overexpression of C-type γ-PCDH C3 decreased the preferential connection between sister cells(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Lv et al., 2022</xref>). However, our study demonstrated that only variable, but not C-type isoforms had a negative impact on synapse formation. This discrepancy might be attributed to the lineage relationship, which could have an unknown impact on synapse formation. Since a single neuron can express multiple isoforms, deleting all γ-PCDH isoforms might mask the role of this combination. In this study, we manipulated the combinatorial expression patterns of γ-PCDH isoforms in nearby neocortical neurons through sequential <italic>in utero</italic> electroporation, expressing different batches of isoforms with adjustable similarities. We observed that when two neurons expressed identical variable isoforms (100% group), the likelihood of synapse formation between them was lowest. As the similarity level between two cells decreased, with fewer shared isoforms, the connectivity probability increased. The connectivity probability between neurons with different variable isoforms (0% group) did not differ from the control pairs (without overexpression). However, the connections between overexpressed and control neurons were not affected under both 100% and 0% similarity conditions. These observations suggest that the similarity level, rather than the absolute expression of the protein, affects synapse formation between neurons.</p>
<p>Our findings also demonstrated that the overexpression of multiple γ-PCDH variable isoforms in one neuron only affected its connection if the other neuron overexpressed an identical combination of PCDHg isoforms. This indicates that the expression of multiple PCDHg variable isoforms in a neuron assists in selecting its synapse partner, emphasizing the essential role of diversified combinatorial expression of γ-PCDHs in synaptic specificity in the mouse neocortex. Moreover, the overexpression of the γ-PCDH C4 isoform did not affect synaptic connections, while overexpression of six variable isoforms led to a reduction in the connection rate in <italic>pcdhg</italic> cKO mice. These findings suggest that the variables, but not the C-type isoforms of γ-PCDHs, play crucial roles in the synapse formation in the mouse neocortex.</p>
<p>While the absence of γ-PCDHs causes significantly more synaptic formation among neocortical pyramidal neurons, evidence supports that their absence also leads to a significant reduction of synapse formation in other brain regions. For example, mice lacking γ-PCDHs exhibit fewer synapses in spinal cord interneurons(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Weiner et al., 2005</xref>). Knocking down γ-PCDHs causes a decline in dendritic spines in cultured hippocampal neurons(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Suo et al., 2012</xref>) and decrease the astrocyte-neuron contacts in the coculture from the developing spinal cord(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Garrett and Weiner, 2009</xref>). The absence of γ-PCDHs leads to the reduction of dendritic arborization and dendritic spines in olfactory granule cells(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Ledderose et al., 2013</xref>). Additionally, immuno-positive signals for γ-PCDHs are more frequently detected in mushroom spines than in thin spines(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">LaMassa et al., 2021</xref>). Moreover, we observed that the absence of γ-PCDHs impacted vertical-aligned neurons more than horizontal-situated pairs in the neocortex. These findings suggest that different mechanisms may be employed by synapses in different brain regions to achieve their specificity. Notably, different mechanisms have already been proposed for targeting specific inhibitory neural circuits in the neocortex, including “on-target” synapse formation for targeting apical dendrites and “off-target” synapse selective removal for somatic innervations(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Gour et al., 2021</xref>).</p>
<p>In summary, our data demonstrate that the similarity level of γ-PCDH isoforms between neocortical neurons is critical for their synapse formation, with neurons expressing more similar γ-PCDH isoforms patterns exhibiting a lower probability of forming synapses between them. This suggests that the presence of γ-PCDHs enables neocortical neurons to choose which neurons to avoid synapsing with, rather than selecting specific neurons to form synapses with. Whether there are specific attractive forces between cells to promote synaptic specificity remains an open question.</p>

<p>This study presents a <bold>valuable</bold> finding on the functional significance of protocadherin gamma (PCDHg) isoforms in establishing or maintaining functional synaptic connectivity. The authors used sophisticated methods such as single-cell sequencing and whole-cell patch-clamp recordings and obtained <bold>solid</bold> results that suggest that the neurons expressing the same PCDHg isoforms are less likely to be synaptically connected to each other. These results are largely consistent with previous results using morphological criteria.</p>

<p>The manuscript by Zhu and colleagues aimed to clarify the importance of isoform diversity of PCDHg in establishing cortical synapse specificity. The authors optimized 5' single-cell sequencing to detect cPCDHg isoforms and showed that the pyramidal cells express distinct combinations of PCDHg isoforms. Then, the authors conducted patch-clamp recordings from cortical neurons whose PCDHg diversity was disrupted. In the elegant experiment in Figure 3, the authors demonstrated that the neurons expressing the same sets of cPCDHg isoforms are less likely to form synapses with each other, suggesting that identical cPCDHg isoforms may have a repulsive effect on synapse formation. Importantly, this phenomenon was dependent on the similarity of the isoforms present in neurons but not on the amount of proteins expressed.</p>
<p>One of the major concerns in an earlier version was whether PCDHg isoforms, which are expressed at a much lower level than C-type isoforms, have true physiological significance. The authors conducted additional experiments to address this point by using PCDHg cKO and provided convincing data supporting their conclusion. The results from PCDHg C4 overexpression, showing no impact on synaptic connectivity, further clarified the importance of isoforms. I have no further concerns, however, I would like to point out that the evidence for the necessity of the PCDHg isoform is still lacking because most experiments were done by overexpression. It would be helpful for the readers if the authors could add this point to the discussion.</p>

<p>This short manuscript by Zhu et al. describes an investigation into the role of gamma protocadherins in synaptic connectivity in the mouse cerebral cortex. First, the authors conduct a single-cell RNA-seq survey of postnatal day 11 mouse cortical neurons, using an adapted 10X Genomics method to capture the 5' sequences that are necessary to identify individual gamma protocadherin isoforms (all 22 transcripts share the same three 3' &quot;constant&quot; exons, so standard 3'-biased methods can't distinguish them). This method adaptation is an advance for examining individual gamma transcripts, and it is helpful to publish the method, the characterization of which is improved in this revised manuscript. The results largely confirm what was known from other approaches, which is that a few of the 19 A and B subtype gamma protocadherins are expressed in an apparently stochastic and combinatorial fashion in each cortical neuron, while the 3 C subtype genes are expressed ubiquitously. Second, using elegant paired electrophysiological recordings, the authors show that in gamma protocadherin cortical slices, the likelihood of two neurons on layers 2/3 being synaptically connected is increased. That suggests that gamma protocadherins generally inhibit synaptic connectivity in the cortex; again, this has been reported previously using morphological assays, but it is important to see it confirmed here with physiology. Finally, the authors use an impressive sequential in utero electroporation method to provide evidence that the degree of isoform matching between two neurons negatively regulates their reciprocal synaptic connectivity. These are difficult experiments to do, and while some caveats remain, the main result is consistent. Strengths include the impressive methodology and improved demonstration of the previously-reported finding that gamma protocadherins work via homophilic matching to put a brake on synapse formation in the cortex. Weaknesses include the writing, which even in the revision fails to completely put the new results in context with prior work, which together has largely shown similar results; a still-incomplete characterization of a new alpha protocadherin KO mouse (a minor point but it should still be addressed); and a lack of demonstration of protein levels in electroporated brains. Because of the unique organization and expression pattern of the gamma protocadherins, it is unlikely that these results will be directly applicable to the broader understanding of the role of cell adhesion molecules in synapse development. However, the methodology, which is now better described, should be applicable more broadly and the improved demonstration of the role of gamma protocadherin's negative role in cortical synaptogenesis is helpful.</p>

<p>In this study, Zhu and authors investigate the expression and function of the clustered Protocadherins (cPcdhs) in synaptic connectivity in the mouse cortex. The cPcdhs encode a large family of cadherin-related transmembrane molecules hypothesized to regulate synaptic specificity through combinatorial expression and homophilic binding between neurons expressing matching cPcdh isoforms. But the evidence for combinatorial expression has been limited to a few cell types, and causal functions between cPcdh diversity and wiring specificity have been difficult to test experimentally. This study addresses two important but technically challenging questions in the mouse cortex: 1) Do single neurons in the cortex express different cPcdh isoform combinations? and 2) Does Pcdh isoform diversity or particular combinations among pyramidal neurons influence their connectivity patterns? Focusing on the Pcdh-gamma subcluster of 22 isoforms, the group performed 5'end-directed single-cell RNA sequencing from dissociated postnatal (P11) cortex. To address the functional role of Pcdhg diversity in cortical connectivity, they asked whether the Pcdhgs and isoform matching influence the likelihood of synaptic pairing between 2 nearby pyramidal neurons. They performed simultaneous whole-cell recordings of 6 pyramidal neurons in cortical slices, and measured paired connections by evoked monosynaptic responses. In these experiments, they measured synaptic connectivity between pyramidal neurons lacking the Pcdhgs, or overexpressing dissimilar or matching sets of Pcdhg isoforms introduced by electroporation of plasmids encoding Pcdhg cDNAs.</p>
<p>Overall, the study applies elegant methods that demonstrate that single cortical neurons express different combinations of Pcdh-gamma isoforms, including the upper layer Pyramidal cells that are assayed in paired recordings. The electrophysiology data demonstrate that nearby Pyramidal neurons lacking the entire Pcdhg cluster are more likely to be synaptically connected compared to the control neurons, and that overexpression of matching isoforms between pairs decreases the likelihood to be synaptically connected. These are important and compelling findings that advance the idea that the Pcdhgs are important for cortical synaptic connectivity, and that the repertoire of isoforms expressed by neurons influence their connectivity patterns potentially through a self/non-self discrimination mechanism. However, the findings are limited to probability in connectivity and do they do not support the authors' conclusions that Pcdhg isoforms regulate synaptic specificity, 'by preventing synapse formation with specific cells' or to 'unwanted partners'. Characterizations of the cellular basis of these defects are needed to determine whether they are secondary to other roles in cell positioning, axon/dendrite branching and synaptic pruning, and overall synaptic formation. Claims that Pcdh-alpha and Pcdhg C-type isoforms are not functionally required are premature, due to limitations of the experiments. Moreover, claims that 'similarity level of γ-PCDH isoforms between neurons regulate the synaptic formation' are not supported due to weak statistical analyses presented in Fig4. The overstatements should be corrected. There was also missed opportunity to clearly discuss these results in the context of other published work, including recent publications focused on the cortex.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>- The 5' end sequencing with a Pcdhg-amplified library is a technical feat and addresses the pitfall of conventional scRNA-Seq methods due to the identical 3'sequences shared by all Pcdhg isoform and the low abundance of the variable exons. New figures with annotated cell types confirm that several pyramidal and inhibitory cortical subpopulations were captured.</p>
<p>-Statistical assessment of co-occurrence of isoform expression within clusters is also a strength.</p>
<p>- By establishing the combinatorial expression of Pcdhgs by maturing pyramidal cells, the study further substantiates the 'single neuron combinatorial code for cPcdhs' model. Although combinatorial expression is not universal (ie. serotonergic neurons), there was limited evidence. The findings that individual pyramidal neurons express ~1-3 variable Pcdhg transcripts plus the C-type transcripts aligns with single RT-PCR studies of single Purkinje cells (Esumi et al 2005; Toyoda et al 2014). They differ from the findings by Lv et al 2022, where C-type expression was lower among pyramidal neurons. OSNs also do not substantially express C-type isoforms (Mountoufaris et al 2017; Kiefer et al 2023). Differences, and the advantages of the 5'end -directed sequencing (vs. SmartSeq) could be raised in the discussion.</p>
<p>- Simultaneous whole-cell recordings and pairwise comparisons of pyramidal neurons is a technically outstanding approach. They assess the effects of Pcdhg OE isoform on the probability of paired connections.</p>
<p>- The connectivity assay between nearby pairs proved to be sensitive to quantify differences in probability in Pcdhg-cKO and overexpression mutants. The comparisons of connectivity across vertical vs lateral arrangement are also strengths. Overexpressing identical Pcdhg isoform (whether 1 or 6) reduces the probability of connectivity, but there are caveats to the interpretations (see below).</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>-The experiments support a role for the Pcdhgs in influencing the probability of synaptic connectivity between nearby pairs but are not sufficient evidence for synapse specificity. The cPcdhs play multiple roles in neurite arborization, synaptic density, and cell positioning. Kostadinov 2015 also showed that starburst cells lacking the Pcdhgs maintained increased % connectivity at maturity, suggesting a lack of refinement in the absence of Pcdhgs. The known roles raise questions on how these manipulations might have primary effects in these processes and then subsequently impact the probability of connectivity. Investigations of morphological aspects of pyramidal development would strengthen the study and potentially refine the findings. The authors should more clearly relate their findings to the body of cPcdh studies in the discussion.</p>
<p>- Pcdhg cKO-dependent effects on connectivity occur between closely spaced soma (50-100um - Figure 2E), highlighting the importance of spatial arrangement to connectivity (also noted by Tarusawa 2016). Was distance considered for the overexpression (OE) assays, and did the authors note changes in cell distribution which might diminish the connectivity? Recent work by Lv et al 2022 reported that manipulating Pcdhgs influences the dispersion of clonally-related pyramidal neurons, which also impacts the likelihood of connections. Overexpression of Pcdhgc3 increased cell dispersion and decreased the rate of connectivity between pairs. Though these papers are mentioned, they should be discussed in more detail and related to this work.</p>
<p>- Though the authors added suggested citations and improved the contextualization of the study, several statements do not accurately represent the cited literature. It is at the expense of crystalizing the novelty and importance of this present work. For instance, Garrett et al 2012 PMID: 22542181 was the first to describe roles for Pcdhgs in cortical pyramidal cells and dendrite arborization, and that pyramidal cell migration and survival are intact. Line 52 cited Wang et al 2002, but this was limited to gross inspection. Garrett et al is the correct citation for: 'The absence of γ-PCDH does not cause general abnormality in the development of the cerebral cortex, such as cell differentiation, migration, and survival (Wang et al., 2002).' Second, single cell cPcdh diversity is introduced very generally, as though all neuron types are expected to show combinatorial variable expression with ubiquitous C-Type expression. But those initial studies were limited to Purkinje cells (Esumi 2005 and Toyoda 2014). Profiling of serotonergic neurons and OSN reveals different patterns (citations needed for Chen 2017 PMID: 28450636; Mountofaris et al PMID: 2845063; Canzio 2023 PMID: 37347873), raising the idea that cPcdh diversity and ubiquitous C-type expression is not universal. Thus, the authors missed the opportunity to emphasize the gap regarding cPcdh diversity in the cortex.</p>
<p>- They have not shown rigorously and statistically that the rate of connectivity changes with% isoform matching. In Figure 4D, comparisons of % isoform matching in OE assays show a single statistical comparison between the control and 100% groups, but not between the 0%, 11% and 33% groups. Is there a significant difference between the other groups? Significant differences are claimed in the results section, but statistical tests are not provided. The regression analysis in 4E suggests a correlation between % isoform similarity and connectivity probability, but this is not sound as it is based on a mere 4 data points from 4D. The authors previously explained that they cannot evaluate the variance in these recordings as they must pool data together. However, there should be some treatment of variability, especially given the low baseline rate of connectivity. Or at the very least, they should acknowledge the limitations that prevent them from assessing this relationship. Claims in lines 230+ are not supported: ' Overall, our findings demonstrate a negative correlation between the probability of forming synaptic connections and the similarity level of γ-PCDH isoforms expressed in neuron pairs (Fig. 4E)&quot;.</p>
<p>-Figure 4 provides connectivity probability, but this result might be affected by overall synapse density. Did connection probability change with directionality (e.g between red to green cells, or green to red cells).</p>
<p>-Generally, the statistical approaches were not sufficiently described in the methods nor in the figure legends, making it difficult to assess the findings. They do not report on how they calculated FDR for connectivity data, when this is typically used for larger multivariate datasets.</p>
<p>- The possibility that the OE effects are driven by total Pcdhg levels, rather isoform matching, should be examined. As shown by qRT-PCR in Fig. 3, expression of individual isoforms can vary. It is reasonable that protein levels cannot be measured by IHC, although epitope tags could be considered as C-terminal tagging of cPcdhs preserves the function in mice (see Lefebvre 2008). Quantification of constant Pcdhg RNA levels by qRT-PCR or sc-RT-PCR would directly address the potential caveat that OE levels vary with isoform combinations.</p>
<p>-A caveat for the relative plasmid expression quantifications in Figure 3-S1 is that IHC was used to amplify the RFP-tagged isoform, and thus does not likely preserve the relationship between quantities and detection.</p>
<p>-Figure 1 didn't change in response to reviews to improve clarity. New panels relating to the scRNA-Seq analyses were added to supplementary data but many are central and should be included in Figure 1 (ie. S1-Fig6D). In the Results, the authors state that neuronal subpopulations generally show a combinatorial expression of some variable RNA isoforms and near ubiquitous C-type expression. But they only show data for the Layer 2/3 neuron-specific cluster in S1-Fig-6D, and so it is not clear if this pattern applies to other clusters. Fig. S1-5 show a low number of expressed isoforms per cell, but specific descriptions on whether these include C-type isoforms would be helpful. Figure 1F showing isoform profile in all neurons is not particularly meaningful. There is a lot of interest in neuron-type specific differences in cPcdh diversity, and the authors could highlight their data from S1-5 accordingly.</p>
<p>-The concept of co-occurrence and results should be explained within the results section, to more clearly relate this concept to data and interpretations. Explanations are now found in the methods, but this did not improve the clarity of this otherwise very interesting aspect of the study.</p>
<p>- The claim that C-type Pcdhgs do not functionally influence connectivity is premature. Tests were limited to PcdhgC4, which has unique properties compared to the other 2 C-type isoforms (Garrett et al 2019 PMID: 31877124; Mancia et al PMID: 36778455). The text should be corrected to limit the conclusion to PcdhgC4, and not generally to C-type. The authors should test PcdhgC3 and PcdhgC5 isoforms.</p>
<p>-The group generated a novel conditional Pcdh-alpha mouse allele using CRISPR methods, and state that there were no changes in synaptic connectivity in these Pcdh-alpha mutants. But this claim is premature. The Southern blots validate the targeting of the allele. But further validations are required to establish that this floxed allele can be efficiently recombined, disrupting Pcdha protein levels and function. Pcdha alleles have been validated by western blots and by demonstration of the prominent serotonergic axonal phenotype of Pcdha-KO (ie. Chen 2017 PMID: 28450636; Ing-Esteves 2018 PMID: 29439167).</p>
<p>-The Discussion would be strengthened by a deeper discussion of the findings to other cPcdh roles and studies, and of the limitations of the study. The idea that the Pcdhgs are influencing the rate of connectivity through a repulsion mechanism or synaptic formation (ie through negative interactions with synaptic organizers such as Nlgn - Molumby 2018, Steffen 2022) could be presented in a model, and supported by other literature.</p>
