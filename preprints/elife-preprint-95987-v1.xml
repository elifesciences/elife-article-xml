<abstract>
<title>Abstract</title><p>Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a multisystemic disorder that manifests through motor and non-motor symptoms. Motor dysfunction is the most debilitating and it is caused by the degeneration of dopamine-producing neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc). A body of evidence indicates that synapse demise precedes by years neuronal death. Still, early synaptic dysfunctions in PD are poorly deciphered.</p>
<p>Here we combined literature metanalysis, proteomics and phosphoproteomics with biochemical, imaging and electrophysiological measurements in neurons, brains and synaptosomes from knockout and knockin mouse models, as well as human iPSC-derived neurons associated with the PD-kinase LRRK2.</p>
<p>We show that phosphorylation of LRRK2 at Ser935, which controls LRRK2 subcellular localization, rapidly increases upon brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) stimulation of differentiated SH-SY5Y cells and primary mouse neurons. Affinity-purification coupled with mass spectrometry (AP-MS/MS) analysis revealed that LRRK2 interactome is significantly reshaped upon BDNF stimulation, with an interconnected network of actin cytoskeleton-associated proteins increasing their binding to LRRK2. Accordingly, LRRK2 knockout neurons exhibit decreased TrkB signaling and fail to induce BDNF-dependent spinogenesis. <italic>In vivo</italic>, one-month old <italic>Lrrk2</italic> knockout mice display defects in spine maturation, a phenotype that disappears with age. In human iPSC-derived cortical neurons, BDNF increases the frequency of miniature excitatory post-synaptic currents (mEPSC) in wild-type but not in the presence of LRRK2 knockout, functionally supporting a distinctive role of LRRK2 in BDNF-synaptic signaling. Finally, Lrrk2 G2019S PD mutant synaptosomes display differentially phosphorylated proteins enriched in categories related to postsynaptic structural organization.</p>
<p>Taken together, our study discloses a critical function of LRRK2 in BDNF-dependent synaptic processes and identifies the postsynaptic actin cytoskeleton as a convergent site of LRRK2 pathophysiological activity.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Synaptic damage and connectome dysfunction are emerging as early pathological events preceding neurodegeneration and the manifestation of clinical symptoms in multiple neurodegenerative disorders, including Parkinson’s disease (PD).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup> PD is an age-related motor disorder for which no cure is available. The motor symptoms typically manifest as a consequence of the progressive loss of the dopaminergic neurons of the Substantia Nigra pars compacta (SNpc) projecting to the striatum.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup> The degeneration of the nigrostriatal projections precedes the loss of the dopaminergic cell bodies in the SNpc and synaptic failure may be the triggering cause of axonal deterioration.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup> Pre- and postsynaptic alterations were described in PD animal models.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup> For example, PD pathology was reported as associated with an evident striatal spine loss, that appeared to be correlated with the degree of dopamine denervation prevalently due to glutamate excitotoxicity in striatal neurons.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>Accumulating evidence indicate that more than half of the causative genes and risk factors for PD have a function at the synapse. Mutations in <italic>LRRK2</italic> gene represent the most common cause of autosomal dominant late onset familial PD and variations around <italic>LRRK2</italic> locus increase lifetime risk for PD.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup> Pathogenic mutations are clustered into the enzymatic core of the LRRK2 protein, composed by a Roc/GTPase and a kinase domain, bridged by a COR scaffold.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup> The most frequent mutation (G2019S) located in the kinase domain results in a protein with a gain of kinase activity, associated with increased cellular toxicity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup> Previous data from our team and other laboratories suggested that LRRK2 sits at the crossroads between cytoskeletal dynamics and vesicular trafficking. LRRK2 activity seems to be mediated via interactions with a plethora of cytoskeletal and vesicle-associated proteins and via phosphorylation of a subset of Rab GTPases.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup> LRRK2 subcellular localization is dynamically controlled by phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of a cluster of N-terminal serine residues (e.g. Ser935 and Ser910), which determines 14-3-3 protein binding.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup> Phosphorylation of LRRK2 Ser935 and Ser910 is regulated by multiple kinases, including casein kinase 1 alpha (CK1a), IKKs and protein kinase A (PKA),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup> and serves as a scaffold for 14-3-3 protein binding and LRRK2 subcellular localization.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup> In immune cells, extracellular signals such as Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) agonists stimulate LRRK2 Ser935 and Ser910 phosphorylation to positively modulate immune-related responses.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup> In contrast, the extracellular signals that orchestrate Ser935 phosphorylation in neurons are still unknown. However, the ability of the neurons to relocate LRRK2 to the synapse is particularly important as LRRK2 was suggested to provide the scaffold for the assembly of the signalling cascade effectors to sustain the main synaptic functions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup> LRRK2 has been shown to regulate synaptic vesicles cycling at the presynaptic site through interaction and phosphorylation of a panel of pre-synaptic proteins,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup> such as NSF,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup> synapsin I,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup> EndophylinA,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup> synaptojanin-1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup> and DNAJC6/Auxilin.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup> Interestingly, recent literature supports a role for LRRK2 in the dendritic spine compartment, where it was suggested to influence receptor traffic,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup> spine morphology and functionality in developing brains.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup></p>
<p>Here, starting from the observation that brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) stimulates LRRK2 Ser935 phosphorylation in neurons, we used unbiased protein-protein interaction (PPI) and phosphoproteomic investigations to disclose a novel function of LRRK2 in regulating actin-dependent synaptic dynamics in complementary neuronal models.</p>

<title>BDNF treatment rapidly increases LRRK2 phosphorylation at Ser935</title>
<p>Neurotrophic factors plastically shape neuronal activity by binding to their cognate receptor tyrosine kinases.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup> Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is particularly important to modulate neurotransmission in the cortico-striatal circuitry.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup> This circuitry is relevant for PD and presents with the highest LRRK2 expression in comparison with the rest of the brain.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup> To address whether LRRK2 Ser935 phosphorylation is stimulated by BDNF, we prepared primary mouse cortical neurons from C57BL/6J wild-type mice and stimulated them with 100 ng/ml of BDNF at days in vitro 14 (DIV14) when synapses are fully functional (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>) and LRRK2 expression is detectable.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup> Western blot analysis revealed a rapid (5 mins) and transient increase of Ser935 phosphorylation after BDNF treatment (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1C</xref>). Of interest, BDNF failed to stimulate Ser935 phosphorylation when neurons were pretreated with the LRRK2 inhibitor MLi-2, indicating that either LRRK2 kinase activity controls the upstream kinases activated by BDNF or that the binding with MLi-2, a type I inhibitor, locks the kinase in a conformation that favors dephosphorylation/hinders phosphorylation during the stimulus.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup></p>

<p>To gain mechanistic insights into the effects of BDNF stimulation on LRRK2 function, we differentiated neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells with 10 µM retinoic acid (RA) treatment for 6 days<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup> and measured BDNF response by monitoring Tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB) levels and phosphorylation of AKT and ERK1/2, two major downstream effector pathways of BDNF/TrkB signaling (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup> Expression of TrkB is undetectable in undifferentiated SH-SY5Y cells, whereas RA-differentiation boosts TrkB expression (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>). Accordingly, differentiated SH-SY5Y cells respond to 100 ng/ml BDNF stimulation, as evidenced by increased phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and AKT (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F-G</xref>). Strikingly, BDNF treatment stimulates Ser935 phosphorylation of endogenous LRRK2 with a phosphorylation kinetics overlapping with that observed in primary neurons (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1H</xref>). These findings support RA-differentiated SH-SY5Y as a valuable model to investigate a novel BDNF-LRRK2 pathway.</p>

<title>BDNF promotes LRRK2 interaction with actin cytoskeleton components enriched at the postsynapse</title>
<p>To clarify the implications of BDNF-mediated Ser935 phosphorylation on LRRK2 neuronal function, we used affinity purification coupled with mass spectrometry (AP-MS/MS). As the yields of endogenous LRRK2 purification were insufficient for AP-MS/MS analysis, we generated polyclonal SH-SY5Y cells stably expressing GFP-LRRK2 wild-type or GFP control (Supplementary Fig. 1). Then we used GFP-trap purification to isolate GFP or GFP-LRRK2 from RA-differentiated cells unstimulated or stimulated with BDNF for 15 mins prior to MS analysis. The unstimulated LRRK2 interactome (GFP-LRRK2 vs. GFP) is large (207 significant hits) and consistent with previous computational analysis of LRRK2 PPIs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup> In particular, we confirmed interactions with known LRRK2 binders including 14-3-3 proteins, cytoskeletal proteins and protein translation factors (Supplementary table 1). Since BDNF is synaptically released and influences pre- and post-synaptic mechanisms, we used SynGO<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup> to identify synaptic LRRK2 interactors. About one-third (35%) of LRRK2 PPI under unstimulated conditions are SynGO annotated genes; among them, 33% are presynaptic proteins and 66% are post-synaptic proteins (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>). The most significant enriched categories were pre- and post-synaptic ribosome and post-synaptic actin cytoskeleton (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>).</p>

<p>We next compared unstimulated vs. BDNF-stimulated LRRK2 interactome. As shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>, 15 minutes of BDNF stimulation reshapes LRRK2 PPI, with a group of interactors increasing binding with LRRK2 (blue dots) and another group decreasing binding (orange dots). The inclusion criteria were either <italic>P</italic> value &lt; 0.05 and fold change FC &gt; 0.5 | FC &lt; −0.5 or FC &gt; 1 | FC &lt; −1 independently from the <italic>P</italic> value. In this way, we increased the discovery power for gene ontology analysis. SynGO gene ontology revealed that 10 out of 19 hits with increased binding after BDNF (BDNF(+)) and 21 out of 50 hits with decreased binding (BDNF(-)) are synaptic proteins (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref> inset). Among synaptic interactors, the BDNF(+) binders are enriched in actin-cytoskeleton-related GO:BP categories while the BDNF(-) binders are enriched in protein translation GO:BP categories (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>). Furthermore, 80% of synaptic BDNF(+) LRRK2 binders (DBN1, ARPC2, ACTR2, ACTR3, CFL1, CALD1, ACTN1, FLNA) and 62% of synaptic BDNF(-) binders (RPS2, RPS4X, RPS7, RPS9, RPS11, RPS13, RPS15A, RPL13, RPL23, RPL26, RPL27A, TUFM, EEF1A2, PCBP1) form functional and physical interaction networks (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2F-E</xref>).</p>
<p>To validate these findings, we performed western blot analysis on the AP samples analyzed by MS. We selected drebrin, encoded by <italic>DBN1</italic>, because it sits at the center of the BDNF(+) network (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref>, inset SynGO) and, in DIV14 primary neurons, it colocalizes with PSD95, a postsynaptic marker (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2G</xref>), confirming previous observations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup> As predicted, BDNF treatment increases LRRK2:drebrin interaction by ∼2 fold (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2H-I</xref> and Supplementary Fig. 2). We conclude that BDNF stimulation engages LRRK2 into actin cytoskeleton dynamics through physical association with actin-related proteins. This stimulus-dependent function may be relevant at the postsynaptic site (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2G</xref>). Our findings also suggest that a pool of LRRK2 binds protein translation factors under unstimulated conditions and translocates to the actin-cytoskeleton upon BDNF-TrkB signaling.</p>

<title>An actin-synaptic cluster from a literature-based LRRK2 PPI network</title>
<p>We recently investigated the molecular environment surrounding LRRK2 specifically by constructing the protein-protein interaction (PPI) interactome around LRRK2 based on PPIs derived from peer reviewed literature. After filtering the LRRK2 PPIs for reproducibility (keeping only those interactions that have been reported at least twice in literature or at least replicated with 2 different interaction detection methods) we obtained the interactions linking across the LRRK2 interactors thus effectively building the LRRK2 protein interaction network (LRRK2<sub>net</sub>) which describes the protein milieu around LRRK2 in the cellular context (see Zhao <italic>et al.</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup> for details). The LRRK2<sub>net</sub> was topologically analyzed to identify the portions (clusters) of the network that are more densely connected locally in comparison with the overall connectivity of the entire network as these topological clusters are likely to represent functional units.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup> Among the 11 topological clusters identified in Zhao <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup>, we further elaborated on one cluster in particular, containing 41 genes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>) and found that it exhibited significantly GO-BP enriched terms into semantic categories related to: actin polymerization (16 GO-BP terms), synaptic vesicles (5 GO-BP terms), postsynaptic actin-cytoskeleton (2 GO-BP terms), lamellipodium (6 GO-BP terms), cell-neuron projection/size (2 GO-BP terms), DNA recombination/repair (4 GO-BP terms) and uncategorized (6 GO-BP terms) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref> and Supplementary table 2). Out of the 41 proteins forming the cluster, 23 are proteins associated with the actin cytoskeleton including the 4 larger nodes (where the dimension of the nodes is directly proportional to the node degree/connections within the network): DBN1/drebrin, CAPZA2 and LIMA whose association with LRRK2 was identified in Meixner <italic>et al.</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup> and IQGAP1 identified in Liu <italic>et al.</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>). Given the overrepresentation of synapse-related GO-BP terms, we further performed GO functional enrichment using SynGO and mapped 16 synaptic proteins within the cluster (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>). Strikingly, DBN1/drebrin is a key protein in the cluster, as it engages in multiple interactions (16 edges) and sits at the interface between the nodes involved in GO:BPs functions related to the actin cytoskeleton (blue-colored nodes) and to the synapse (red-colored nodes) (Supplementary Fig. 3). Taken together, these findings corroborate our experimental interactome network (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>), supporting the existence of an actin-synaptic LRRK2 network, which appears dynamically shaped by BDNF stimulation.</p>

<title>BDNF-mediated signalling and spinogenesis is impaired in LRRK2 knockout neurons</title>
<p>Based on Ser935 phosphorylation and AP-MS/MS analysis indicating that LRRK2 responds to BDNF (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>), we next asked whether LRRK2 knockout could affect BDNF/TrkB downstream cascades. To this end, we generated LRRK2 knockout (KO) SH-SY5Y cells with CRISPR/Cas9 editing (Supplementary Fig. 4), differentiated them with RA and assessed their response to BDNF stimulation. While application of BDNF increases AKT and ERK1/2 phosphorylation in naïve SH-SY5Y, as expected, LRRK2 KO cells exhibit a remarkably weaker response (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A-B</xref>). These results indicate that LRRK2 acts downstream of TrkB and upstream of AKT and ERK1/2, in line with its rapid and transient phosphorylation kinetic upon BDNF stimulation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B-C</xref>).</p>

<p>Likewise, <italic>Lrrk2</italic> WT and KO primary cortical neurons at DIV14 were stimulated with BDNF at different timepoints. Similar to differentiated SH-SY5Y cells, <italic>Lrrk2</italic> WT neurons responded to BDNF by rapidly increasing Akt and Erk1/2 phosphorylation, whilst KO neurons exhibited a significantly reduced phosphorylation of Akt and Erk1 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D-E</xref>). Of note, 90 mins of Lrrk2 inhibition (MLi-2) prior to BDNF stimulation did not prevent phosphorylation of Akt and Erk1/2, suggesting that LRRK2 participates in BDNF-induced phosphorylation of Akt and Erk1/2 independently from its kinase activity but dependently from its ability to be phosphorylated at Ser935 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C-D</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B-C</xref>).</p>

<title>Dendritic spine maturation is delayed in <italic>Lrrk2</italic> knockout mice</title>
<p>Based on the <italic>in vitro</italic> results indicating that BDNF stimulates the recruitment of LRRK2 through Ser935 phosphorylation and binding to actin-cytoskeleton to promote spinogenesis, we next investigated whether loss of <italic>Lrrk2 in vivo</italic> results in dendritic spine defects. During development, dendritic spines are highly dynamic, with a rate of extension and retraction that allows proper and accurate synapse formation and neuronal circuit assembly.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref></sup> By the adulthood, dendritic spines formation, motility, and pruning decrease reaching a relatively stable number of protrusions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref></sup> Since spines dynamics vary according to the stage of brain development, we performed a longitudinal analysis of young (1 month-old), adult (4 month-old) and aged (18 month-old) <italic>Lrrk2</italic> WT and KO mice in order to capture any age-dependent defect (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>). We focused on the dorsal striatum, a region highly enriched in SPNs that receives excitatory afferents from the cortex and dopaminergic modulation from the SNpc. This region is relevant in the prodromal stages of PD neurodegeneration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref></sup> and expresses high levels of LRRK2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref></sup>. Moreover, several studies showed a key role of LRRK2 in shaping the structure and function of excitatory synapses in the striatum.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref></sup> We evaluated the number and morphology of dendritic spines using Golgi-Cox staining (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>). The total number of protrusions varied across ages, but there were no differences between the two genotypes (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>). Instead, the width and the length of the protrusions were reduced in 1 month-old Lrrk2 KO striata with respect to WT. Specifically, the average neck height was 15% shorter and the average head width was 27% smaller, meaning that spines are smaller in <italic>Lrrk2</italic> KO brains. No differences were observed at 4 and 18 months of age (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>). We then classified the morphology of spines into four categories: filopodia and thin protrusions (immature spines) and mushroom and branched protrusions (mature spines). One month-old <italic>Lrrk2</italic> KO animals exhibit a reduced number of filopodia and an increased quantity of thin protrusions, suggesting that loss of Lrrk2 may favor this transition.

<p>Since the overall width/height of <italic>Lrrk2</italic> KO protrusions is reduced (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>), we next analyzed the postsynaptic ultrastructure using electron microscopy. To increase the experimental power, we used a separate group of animals. We measured the postsynaptic density (PSD) length as it directly correlates with the amount of postsynaptic receptors and signaling proteins, thus providing an indication of the synaptic strength (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5E</xref>). PSD is significantly shorter in 1 month-old <italic>Lrrk2</italic> KO animals compared to WT (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001), while no differences in PSD length are observed in 18 month-old KO mice (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5F</xref>). Taken all these data together, we conclude that subtle postsynaptic maturation defects are present in the striatum of post-natal <italic>Lrrk2</italic> KO mice.</p>

<title>Knockout of LRRK2 in human iPSC-derived cortical neurons prevents BDNF-dependent increase of spontaneous electrical activity</title>
<p>To further explore the connection between LRRK2 and BDNF activity in a cell model more relevant for human disease, we differentiated human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) into cortical neurons following established protocols.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref></sup> Wild-type and isogenic LRRK2 knockout hiPSCs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref></sup> were differentiated in parallel for 70 days (3 independent culture rounds per genotype), prior to subjecting them to patch clamp to assess spontaneous neurotransmitter release in the absence or presence of acute exposure to BDNF (24 hrs, 50 ng/ml) (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>). Acute BDNF treatment led to a significant increase in the mean frequency of miniature post-synaptic excitatory currents (mEPSC) in WT cultures (vehicle: 0.16 ± 0.03 Hz, <italic>n</italic>=15, <italic>N</italic>=3; BDNF: 1.05 ± 0.25 Hz, <italic>n</italic>=10, <italic>N</italic>=3) (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref>, left). This is corroborated by the significant leftward shift in cumulative probability curves of interevent intervals (IEIs) between BDNF-treated neurons versus untreated neurons (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref>, right). In contrast, no significant change in mEPSC frequency of IEI was observed when KO neurons were stimulated with BDNF (pre-BDNF: 1.09 ± 0.21 Hz, <italic>n</italic>=11, <italic>N</italic>=3; post-BDNF: 1.11 ± 0.25 Hz, <italic>n</italic>=12, <italic>N</italic>=3) (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C</xref>). BDNF treatment had instead no effect on the average peak amplitude in both genotypes (WT - vehicle: 11.00 ± 1.85 pA (<italic>n</italic>=14, <italic>N</italic>=3); BDNF 7.4 ± 0.77 pA (<italic>n</italic>=10, <italic>N</italic>=3); KO - vehicle: 10.42 ± 1.53 pA (<italic>n</italic>=11, <italic>N</italic>=3); BDNF 11.12 ± 1.76 pA (<italic>n</italic>=12, <italic>N</italic>=3)) (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6D-E</xref>). Of note, LRRK2 KO cultures appear to exhibit consistently higher mEPSC frequency (not amplitude) with respect to WT cultures (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B-C</xref>, Supplementary Table1). As Lrrk2 KO in mouse display maturation abnormalities of dendric spines during development, it is possible that anomalous synaptic maturation also occurs in LRRK2 KO hiPSCs. In this experimental paradigm, we conclude that BDNF mainly affects the presynapse rather than the postsynapse (unchanged mEPSC amplitude), likely increasing neurotransmitter release in WT neurons. Indeed, confocal imaging of synapses shows no increase in the total number of synapses under BDNF stimulation (Supplementary Fig. 5), thus pointing directly to an increase in release probability (P<sub>r</sub>) of presynaptic neurotransmitter. Importantly, loss of LRRK2 blunts the positive effect of BDNF on synaptic transmission.</p>

<title>Phosphoproteome of Lrrk2<sup>G2019S</sup> synaptosomes is enriched in postsynaptic structure organization SynGO terms</title>
<p>Our data so far indicate that LRRK2 influences synaptic morphology and BDNF-dependent function by engaging in complex formation with actin-cytoskeleton elements. We then asked whether the kinase activity of LRRK2 may also play a role in these processes. To this end, we purified synaptosomes from WT and hyperactive Lrrk2<sup>G2019S</sup> knockin (KI) mice and performed phosphopeptide enrichment and MS analysis (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7A</xref>). Synaptosomal preparations are highly enriched in pre- and postsynaptic components.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup> We identified 2957 phosphopeptides common between WT and Lrrk2<sup>G2019S</sup> synaptosomes.

The LRRK2 kinase substrates Rabs are not present in the list of significant phosphopeptides, likely due to the low stoichiometry and/or abundance.

One hundred thousand random lists containing 207 proteins each (to mimic the AP-MS list) were overlapped with the 267 significant genes in the phosphoproteomic dataset resulting in a distribution of overlaps peaking around 2, indicating that 5 overlaps are not a random event. Four (CEP170, HSP90AB1, MAP1B and TUBA1A) were previously reported LRRK2 interactors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref></sup> Strikingly, DBN1/drebrin is a significant hit also in this dataset.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Understanding the early events that lead to synaptic dysfunction in PD is crucial to design effective therapeutic approaches. Previous work from our laboratories and other groups have shown that the PD-associated kinase LRRK2 regulates important synaptic processes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref></sup> At the presynapse, LRRK2 controls synaptic vesicles cycle through association with its WD40 domain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref></sup> and phosphorylation of a panel of presynaptic proteins, including N-ethylmaleimide sensitive fusion (NSF)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>, synapsin I<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>, auxilin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>, synaptojanin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup> and EndophylinA.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup> It has also been shown to regulate neurotransmitter release via modulation of presynaptic vesicular interacting proteins. At the postsynapse, LRRK2 plays key roles in shaping the function of excitatory synapses in the striatum.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref></sup> However, the mechanisms underlying LRRK2 synaptic function are still poorly elucidated. In the present study we provide multiple lines of evidence that LRRK2 shapes dendritic spines morphology and synaptic function in response to BDNF neurotrophic stimulation, which promotes relocalization of LRRK2 to the actin-cytoskeleton in a phosphorylation-dependent manner.</p>
<p>There are several novel findings in our study. First, we identify BDNF as an extracellular stimulus increasing LRRK2 Ser935 phosphorylation in neurons. The phosphorylation kinetics are fast and transient, and both Lrrk2 KO neurons and differentiated SH-SY5Y LRRK2 KO cells display reduced AKT and ERK1/2 downstream pathways activation, all consistent with LRRK2 positioned downstream of TrkB/BDNF and upstream of ERK1/2 and AKT. Using a literature-based network analysis of LRRK2 PPIs as well as AP-MS/MS in SH-SY5Y, we found that LRRK2 interacts with a highly interconnected cluster of actin and synaptic proteins, whose association increases after rapid (15 mins) BDNF stimulation. Moreover, loss of <italic>Lrrk2</italic> results in impaired BDNF-induced spinogenesis <italic>in vitro</italic> and delayed spine maturation <italic>in vivo</italic>, pointing to a mechanism whereby BDNF-mediated Ser935 phosphorylation engages LRRK2 into a macromolecular complex required to coordinate actin dynamics during postsynaptic structural plasticity. Accordingly, BDNF is key to reorganize the actin cytoskeleton during long term potentiation (LTP) through the action of Rho GTPases Rac1 and Cdc42.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">73</xref></sup> LRRK2 was previously reported to interact with Rac1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">74</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">75</xref></sup> and with other actin-related proteins.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup> Here we demonstrate that LRRK2 association with actin cytoskeleton in dendritic spines increases upon BDNF stimulation. We validated the BDNF-dependency of the interaction between LRRK2 and drebrin, an actin binding protein that promotes stable F-actin formation in dendritic spines.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup> We found that drebrin phosphorylation at Ser337/Ser339 is significantly lower in synaptosomes from hyperactive Lrrk2 G2019S mice, further strengthening the relevance of this interaction also in a pathological context. Loss of drebrin results in delayed synaptogenesis and inhibition of postsynaptic PSD95 accumulation, suggesting a key role in spine maturation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">76</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">77</xref></sup> During LTP, Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry through N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors causes drebrin exodus from the spine compartment to allow actin monomers entrance and polymerization to increase the size of the cytoskeleton.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">78</xref></sup> We postulate that LRRK2 may favor drebrin exodus at the shaft of the dendrite during plasticity processes. Actin remodeling during spine enlargement is also coordinated by the ARP2/3 complex, which is activated by binding to WAVE family proteins downstream of active Rac1.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">79</xref></sup> Strikingly, we found that BDNF stimulates LRRK2 interaction with three out of seven subunits of the ARP2/3 complex (ACTR2, ACTR3 and ARPC2) and LRRK2 was reported to interact with WAVE proteins.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">80</xref></sup> Altogether these findings, in agreement with our earlier study,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup> highlight a crucial role for LRRK2 in actin-based dendritic spine remodeling. Clearly, future studies should be directed at clarifying the precise molecular dynamics and kinetics of these processes.</p>
<p>Our data in human neurons differentiated from iPSCs further support an effect of LRRK2 in modulating neurotransmission in response to BDNF. Previous evidence has shown that LRRK2 modulates neurotransmitter release,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup> however our current findings imply that these changes can be acutely altered by BDNF signalling with loss of LRRK2 removing this plastic ability to modulate synaptic function upon neurotrophic signaling.</p>
<p>Another interesting aspect disclosed here is a developmental phenotype characterized by defects in spine maturation as consequence of loss of LRRK2. Interestingly, this developmental abnormality is rescued with age. This is not surprising considering that the homologous kinase LRRK1 may compensate for LRRK2 deficiency, as suggested by the overt neurodegeneration observed in double <italic>Lrrk1/Lrrk2</italic> KO mice but absent in the single KO<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">81</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">82</xref></sup> and the redundant but not overlapping pattern of expression of the two kinases.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">83</xref></sup> Indeed, striatal Lrrk2 expression in the rodent brain increases up to postnatal week 4,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">83</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">84</xref></sup> while Lrrk1 transcript in this region is relatively stable during development.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref></sup></p>
<p>The pre- and postsynaptic roles of LRRK2 highlighted in KO models was further corroborated by the phosphoproteomic analysis of WT vs. mutant G2019S striatal synaptosomes, which revealed that LRRK2 kinase activity plays distinct functions in the regulation of synaptic vesicle cycle and in the organization of postsynaptic cytoskeleton and density. Accordingly, ultrastructural and expression analyses showed reduced postsynaptic density in 1 month-old <italic>Lrrk2</italic> KO mice. There is a tight connection between postsynaptic density organization/expansion and actin cytoskeleton. Interactions of the F-actin binding protein Abp1 with members of the Shank family, such as Shank3, serve as anchoring points for the dynamics of postsynaptic actin cytoskeleton.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">85</xref></sup> Reduced expression of Shank3 and Psd95 in 1 month-old Lrrk2 mice further support these connections.</p>
<p>Several lines of evidence indicate that genetic, biochemical and cellular alterations of BDNF/TrkB signaling are linked to PD. At striatal synapses, BDNF/TrkB signaling enhances both dopamine and glutamate release and ERK1/2 activation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">86</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">87</xref></sup> BDNF is required for the establishment of the proper number and for the survival of dopaminergic neurons in the SNpc, <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">88</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">89</xref></sup> and presynaptic dopamine release in the striatum is enhanced by BDNF.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup> BDNF levels are lower in peripheral tissues, brain, and blood of sporadic PD patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">90</xref></sup> Moreover, the V66M polymorphism modifies the risk of sporadic and mutant LRRK2-associated PD.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">91</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c92">92</xref></sup> Decreased BDNF concentration in serum and brain correlates with an increased degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in PD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93">93</xref></sup> and with loss of striatal DA transporter (DAT) in patients with striatal dopaminergic neurodegeneration.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c94">94</xref></sup> Thus, robust literature support deregulation of striatal BDNF signaling in PD. Future studies should be directed at investigating possible deregulated mechanisms of BDNF signaling in G2019S mice and hiPSCs-derived neurons with G2019S mutation.</p>
<p>At the onset of PD, loss of dopaminergic axonal terminals largely exceeds loss of cell bodies,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup> implying that early synapse deterioration may be the trigger of axonal degeneration and, ultimately, neuronal death.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c95">95</xref></sup> In contrast to neuronal loss, which is irreversible, disease-associated synaptic dysfunctions could be rescued through the growth of new terminals and/or dendritic spines.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup> Thus, focusing on early, prodromal dysfunction in PD appears key to design effective therapeutic and preventive strategies, and our study uncovered LRRK2 as a promising disease modifying target of early-stage PD.</p>

<p>Three biological replicates of GFP-trap purifications of SH-SY5Y cells were processed for the proteomics experiments. Gels were stained with Colloidal Coomassie Brilliant Blue (0.25% Brilliant Blue R-250, 40% ethanol, 10% acetic acid in milli-Q water) for at least 1 hour and then rinsed in destaining solution (10% isopropanol, 10% acetic acid in milli-Q water). Gel slices were cut into small pieces and subjected to reduction with dithiothreitol (DTT 10 mM in 50 mM NH4HCO3, for 1 h at 56 °C), alkylation with iodoacetamide (55 mM in 50 mM NH4HCO3, for 45 min at RT and in the dark), and in-gel digestion with sequencing grade modified trypsin (Promega, 12.5 ng/μL in 50 mM NH4HCO3). Samples were analyzed with a LTQ-Orbitrap XL mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) coupled to a HPLC UltiMate 3000 (Dionex – Thermo Fisher Scientific) through a nanospray interface. Peptides were separated at a flow rate of 250 nL/min using an 11-cm-long capillary column (PicoFrit, 75-μm ID, 15-μm tip, New Objective) packed in house with C18 material (Aeris Peptide 3.6 μm XB C18; Phenomenex). A linear gradient of acetonitrile/0.1% formic acid from 3 to 40% was used for peptide separation and the instrument operated in a data dependent acquisition mode with a Top4 method (one full MS scan at 60,000 resolution in the Orbitrap, followed by the acquisition in the linear ion trap of the MS/MS spectra of the four most intense ions). Two technical replicates were acquired for each biological replicate. Raw data files were analyzed using MaxQuant and Andromeda software package<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c100">100</xref></sup> and searched against the human section of the UniProt database (version September 2020, 75093 entries) concatenated with a database of common contaminants found in proteomic experiments. Trypsin was selected as digesting enzyme with up to two missed cleavages allowed, carbamidomethylation of cysteine residues was set as a fixed modification and methionine oxidation as a variable modification. A search against a randomized database was used to assess the false discovery rate (FDR), and data were filtered to remove contaminants and reverse sequences and keep into account only proteins identified with at least two peptides and a FDR ≤ 0.01, both at peptide and protein level.</p>
<p>Intensity values were retrieved for 350 proteins. A single step of data QC was applied to the intensity values: proteins whose intensity value was 0.00 for both the 2 technical replicates in at least 1 of the 3 pull-down experiments performed with LRRK2-GFP were removed. This is a stringent QC step, but it was implemented to remove proteins with no triplicate data available for the LRRK2 pull-down as this could have occurred because of genuine low levels of pull-down (values close to the limit of detection, missing not at random values) or because of technical issues with the single sample (loss/poor quality of sample, missing at random values). QC reduced the number of proteins in the analysis from 350 to 269 entries.</p>
<p>Intensity data were then processed according to Aguilan <italic>et al.</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c101">101</xref></sup> Briefly, intensity data were log2 transformed and normalized to the median of all proteins within the same experiment.

<p>This <bold>valuable</bold> study further discloses the function of LRRK2 in BDNF-dependent synaptic processes in identifying postsynaptic actin cytoskeleton as a convergent site of LRRK2 pathophysiological activity. Multiple approaches in different cellular models provide mostly <bold>solid</bold> (but at times preliminary) evidence to support (many) of the conclusions, overall consistent with bioinformatics analyses covering previously published work. While an exciting start that should be pursued, examples are suggested by reviewers to add in additional experimentation to better support the expansive interpretation. The identification of mechanisms of LRRK2 action at the synapse is considered highly significant, as better knowledge in this regard may provide insight into why dopaminergic cells die with over-active LRRK2.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>LRRK2 protein is familially linked to Parkinson's disease by the presence of several gene variants that all confer a gain-of-function effect on LRRK2 kinase activity.</p>
<p>The authors examine the effects of BDNF stimulation in immortalized neuron-like cells, cultured mouse primary neurons, hIPSC-derived neurons, and synaptosome preparations from the brain. They examine an LRRK2 regulatory phosphorylation residue, LRRK2 binding relationships, and measures of synaptic structure and function.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The study addresses an important research question: how does a PD-linked protein interact with other proteins, and contribute to responses to a well-characterized neuronal signalling pathway involved in the regulation of synaptic function and cell health?</p>
<p>They employ a range of good models and techniques to fairly convincingly demonstrate that BDNF stimulation alters LRRK2 phosphorylation and binding to many proteins. Some effects of BDNF stimulation appear impaired in (some of the) LRRK2 knock-out scenarios (but not all). A phosphoproteomic analysis of PD mutant Knock-in mouse brain synaptosomes is included.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The data sets are disjointed, conclusions are sweeping, and not always in line with what the data is showing. Validation of 'omics' data is very light. Some inconsistencies with the major conclusions are ignored. Several of the assays employed (western blotting especially) are likely underpowered, findings key to their interpretation are addressed in only one or other of the several models employed, and supporting observations are lacking.</p>
<p>As examples to aid reader interpretation:</p>
<p>(a) pS935 LRRK2 seems to go up at 5 minutes but goes down below pre-stimulation levels after (at times when BDNF-induced phosphorylation of other known targets remains very high). This is ignored in favour of discussion/investigation of initial increases, and the fact that BDNF does many things (which might indirectly contribute to initial but unsustained changes to pLRRK2) is not addressed.</p>
<p>(b) Drebrin coIP itself looks like a very strong result, as does the increase after BDNF, but this was only demonstrated with a GFP over-expression construct despite several mouse and neuron models being employed elsewhere and available for copIP of endogenous LRRK2. Also, the coIP is only demonstrated in one direction. Similarly, the decrease in drebrin levels in mice is not assessed in the other model systems, coIP wasn't done, and mRNA transcripts are not quantified (even though others were). Drebrin phosphorylation state is not examined.</p>
<p>(c) The large differences in the CRISPR KO cells in terms of BDNF responses are not seen in the primary neurons of KO mice, suggesting that other differences between the two might be responsible, rather than the lack of LRRK2 protein.</p>
<p>(d) No validation of hits in the G2019S mutant phosphoproteomics, and no other assays related to the rest of the paper/conclusions. Drebrin phosphorylation is different but unvalidated, or related to previous data sets beyond some discussion. The fact that LRRK2 binding occurs, and increases with BDNF stimulation, should be compared to its phosphorylation status and the effects of the G2019S mutation.</p>

<p>Taken as a whole, the data in the manuscript show that BDNF can regulate PD-associated kinase LRRK2 and that LRRK2 modifies the BDNF response. The chief strength is that the data provide a potential focal point for multiple observations across many labs. Since LRRK2 has emerged as a protein that is likely to be part of the pathology in both sporadic and LRRK2 PD, the findings will be of broad interest. At the same time, the data used to imply a causal throughline from BDNF to LRRK2 to synaptic function and actin cytoskeleton (as in the title) are mostly correlative and the presentation often extends beyond the data. This introduces unnecessary confusion. There are also many methodological details that are lacking or difficult to find. These issues can be addressed.</p>
<p>(1) The writing/interpretation gets ahead of the data in places and this was confusing. For example, the abstract highlights prior work showing that Ser935 LRRK2 phosphorylation changes LRRK2 localization, and Figure 1 shows that BDNF rapidly increases LRRK2 phosphorylation at this site. Subsequent figures highlight effects at synapses or with synaptic proteins. So is the assumption that LRRK2 is recruited to (or away from) synapses in response to BDNF? Figure 2H shows that LRRK2-drebrin interactions are enhanced in response to BDNF in retinoic acid-treated SH-SY5Y cells, but are synapses generated in these preps? How similar are these preps to the mouse and human cortical or mouse striatal neurons discussed in other parts of the paper (would it be anticipated that BDNF act similarly?) and how valid are SH-SY5Y cells as a model for identifying synaptic proteins? Is drebrin localization to synapses (or its presence in synaptosomes) modified by BDNF treatment +/- LRRK2? Or do LRRK2 levels in synaptosomes change in response to BDNF? The presentation requires re-writing to stay within the constraints of the data or additional data should be added to more completely back up the logic.</p>
<p>(2) The experiments make use of multiple different kinds of preps. This makes it difficult at times to follow and interpret some of the experiments, and it would be of great benefit to more assertively insert &quot;mouse&quot; or &quot;human&quot; and cell type (cortical, glutamatergic, striatal, gabaergic) etc.</p>
<p>(3) Although BDNF induces quantitatively lower levels of ERK or Akt phosphorylation in LRRK2KO preps based on the graphs (Figure 4B, D), the western blot data in Figure 4C make clear that BDNF does not need LRRK2 to mediate either ERK or Akt activation in mouse cortical neurons and in 4A, ERK in SH-SY5Y cells. The presentation of the data in the results (and echoed in the discussion) writes of a &quot;remarkably weaker response&quot;. The data in the blots demand more nuance. It seems that LRRK2 may potentiate a response to BDNF that in neurons is independent of LRRK2 kinase activity (as noted). This is more of a point of interpretation, but the words do not match the images.</p>
<p>(4) Figure 4F/G shows an increase in PSD95 puncta per unit length in response to BDNF in mouse cortical neurons. The data do not show spine induction/dendritic spine density/or spine morphogenesis as suggested in the accompanying text (page 8). Since the neurons are filled/express gfp, spine density could be added or spines having PSD95 puncta. However, the data as reported would be expected to reflect spine and shaft PSDs and could also include some nonsynaptic sites.</p>
<p>(5) Experimental details are missing that are needed to fully interpret the data. There are no electron microscopy methods outside of the figure legend. And for this and most other microscopy-based data, there are few to no descriptions of what cells/sites were sampled, how many sites were sampled, and how regions/cells were chosen. For some experiments (like Figure 5D), some detail is provided in the legend (20 segments from each mouse), but it is not clear how many neurons this represents, where in the striatum these neurons reside, etc. For confocal z-stacks, how thick are the optical sections and how thick is the stack? The methods suggest that data were analyzed as collapsed projections, but they cite Imaris, which usually uses volumes, so this is confusing. The guide (sgRNA) sequences that were used should be included. There is no mention of sex as a biological variable.</p>
<p>(6) For Figures 1F, G, and E, how many experimental replicates are represented by blots that are shown? Graphs/statistics could be added to the supplement. For 1C and 1I, the ANOVA p-value should be added in the legend (in addition to the post hoc value provided).</p>
<p>(7) Why choose 15 minutes of BDNF exposure for the mass spec experiments when the kinetics in Figure 1 show a peak at 5 mins?</p>
<p>(8) The schematic in Figure 6A suggests that iPSCs were plated, differentiated, and cultured until about day 70 when they were used for recordings. But the methods suggest they were differentiated and then cryopreserved at day 30, and then replated and cultured for 40 more days. Please clarify if day 70 reflects time after re-plating (30+70) or total time in culture (70). If the latter, please add some notes about re-differentiation, etc.</p>
<p>(9) When Figures 6B and 6C are compared it appears that mEPSC frequency may increase earlier in the LRRK2KO preps than in the WT preps since the values appear to be similar to WT + BDNF. In this light, BDNF treatment may have reached a ceiling in the LRRK2KO neurons.</p>
<p>(10) Schematic data in Figures 5A and C and Figures 5B and E are too small to read/see the data.</p>
