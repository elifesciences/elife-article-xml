<title>Abstract</title><p>The rapid cross-species transmission of highly pathogenic avian influenza presents a significant zoonotic threat. Elucidating the avian interferon (IFN) system, the primary antiviral defense in chickens, is critical for controlling the virus at its source and preventing its spillover into humans and other species. We engineered type I (IFN-α/β) and type III (IFN-λ) IFN receptor knockout chickens to dissect the role of IFNs in viral infections. Results revealed that type I IFN predominantly modulates innate immune cell populations, T cell subsets, and their contribution to antibody production following immunization under physiological conditions. <italic>In ovo</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> challenge experiments utilizing diverse influenza A virus strains demonstrated strain-specific roles of both IFN-α/β and IFN-λ in orchestrating viral pathogenesis, immunological responses, and tissue-tropism effects. Notably, type I IFN was particularly crucial in the initial defense mechanisms against H3N1 avian influenza A virus infection. These novel models offer unprecedented insights into avian IFN biology within the context of avian influenza, which is essential for developing more effective strategies to prevent and control this public health challenge.</p>

<title>Summary of Updates:</title>
<fn fn-type="update"><p>In the Abstract and Introduction, minor wording revisions clarify statements on zoonotic risk and therapeutic implications, with an additional mention of the Netherlands alongside France as a country implementing duck vaccination against avian influenza outbreaks.
The Results sections have been carefully reworked for clarity and conciseness. The bioRxiv version integrates improved transitions and adjusted phrasing to better frame findings, for example:
The importance of receptor-targeted over cytokine-targeted knockout strategies in chickens is highlighted more explicitly.
Explanations around immune cell population changes, immunoglobulin responses, and T cell receptor repertoire analyses have been restructured for a clearer, more logical flow.
New contextual background was added to the discussion of the H9N2 strain, emphasizing its potential for genetic reassortment with zoonotic subtypes (e.g., H7N9, H10N8), placing the findings into a broader epidemiological context. This epidemiological framing was absent in the original manuscript.
In the Discussion section, some sections were streamlined to focus more on novel insights from the new knockout models, particularly regarding the complementary roles of type I and III IFNs in avian influenza. The bioRxiv version also introduces a reference to recent findings on neuraminidase mutations in H3N1 strains facilitating systemic spread via plasminogen activation providing a mechanistic explanation for observed high virulence despite classification as low pathogenic.</p></fn>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Chickens are highly susceptible to viral pathogens such as avian influenza A virus (AIV), a zoonotic virus transmissible to humans, which causes significant economic losses in the poultry industry<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. In 2022, 67 countries across five continents reported outbreaks of H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza, losing over 131 million domestic poultry. The disease continued to spread as 14 more countries reported outbreaks, primarily across the Americas<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>. The emergence of various zoonotic avian influenza strains has heightened global concerns about the potential for these strains to mutate and sustain human-to-human transmission, possibly leading to a pandemic<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>. Despite substantial advancements in our comprehension of the mammalian host response to pathogenic insults, knowledge of immune mechanisms in avian species, the natural hosts of the virus, remains limited. As a result, strategies to control AIV have heavily relied on biosecurity measures and depopulation of infected flocks, imposing substantial economic burdens on the poultry industry and amounting to billions of dollars in losses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. The insufficiency of these traditional approaches in managing the growing prevalence of highly pathogenic AIV outbreaks has driven interest in alternative antiviral therapies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. Notably, France and the Netherlands have implemented domestic duck vaccination as a control measure against highly pathogenic avian influenza outbreaks<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Interferons (IFNs) were first identified in chicken embryos. These proteins are characterized by their ability to inhibit viral replication, a property that led to their designation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>. IFNs are cytokines that induce the expression of a myriad of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) that act on innate and adaptive immunity, eliciting an antiviral state against invading viral pathogens<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. They are classified based on their molecular structure, receptor specificity, and induction pathways. In chickens, type I IFNs (IFN-α and IFN-β) and type III IFN (IFN-λ) play critical roles, with IFN-α and IFN-λ being the primary focus of immunological studies due to their significant involvement in antiviral responses. To accomplish the primary function of IFNs, these cytokines need to bind to their respective receptors. The type III IFN receptor is a heterodimer consisting of the ubiquitously expressed receptor chain IL- 10Rβ and the epithelium-specific receptor chain IFNLR1 (IL-28Rα). In contrast, type I IFN (IFNAR1/IFNAR2) receptors demonstrate widespread expression across diverse tissues and cell types throughout the body<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>The molecular cloning and characterization of chicken IFN-λ were relatively recent, uncovering antiviral properties comparable to those of mammalian IFN-λ<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>. However, despite this progress, the mechanisms and functional roles of type I and III IFNs in chickens remain largely uncharacterized. Murine IFN-λ is the initial IFN produced during a viral invasion, providing epithelial antiviral protection against low viral loads without eliciting an inflammatory response<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. When the infection surpasses the control of IFN-λ, type I IFN is activated, associated with an inflammatory response and immunopathology. Unlike the widespread effects of type I IFN, the similarity of IFNLR1 expression with the tissue tropism of influenza A virus allows mammalian IFN-λ to specifically target cell types at risk of infection. This effectively induces antiviral genes in these cells, aiding in controlling influenza A virus spread without overstimulating the immune system and causing immunopathology<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. IFNAR1 knockout (KO) mice show increased susceptibility to several viral infections, but not influenza. However, mice lacking IFNAR1 and IFNLR1 cannot control influenza infection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. Researchers have shown that mammalian IFN-λ can also have pro-inflammatory effects by disrupting the lung epithelial barrier, hindering lung repair, and impairing epithelial proliferation during influenza infections<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Despite the discovery of IFNs in chickens, our knowledge of the avian IFN system remains limited<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>. Unraveling the complexities of the IFN system is crucial for devising strategies to control avian influenza in its natural host, thereby preventing zoonotic transmission to humans and other species. This limitation is primarily due to the complex and overlapping signaling pathways of type I and type III IFNs, which induce similar sets of ISGs and produce almost indistinguishable biological activities despite signaling through distinct receptors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>. Furthermore, our understanding of ISGs and their antiviral functions in chickens is primarily based on research from humans and other mammals, which may not fully account for the fundamental differences in innate immunity between chickens and mammals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. The lack of appropriate biotechnological tools, such as IFN receptors deficient genetically engineered chickens, hinders progress in this field. These challenges make it difficult to elucidate the individual antiviral and immunomodulatory roles of type I and type III IFNs in avian research despite the potential value of these cytokines as targets for developing therapeutics against a broader range of viruses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>To address this gap, we utilized chicken primordial germ cells (PGCs) to generate IFNAR1 and IFNLR1 knockout (KO) chicken lines. These genetically modified lines allow for the selective study of type I and type III IFN responses. Through experiments conducted <italic>in vitro</italic>, <italic>in ovo</italic>, and <italic>in vivo</italic>, we investigated the impact of these IFN classes on various physiological functions, antibody responses to immunization, and host-pathogen interactions. Notably, <italic>in vivo</italic> H3N1 infections revealed distinct and novel mechanisms for both types of chicken IFN in the context of H3N1 defense. These newly developed chicken lines provide critical insights into the roles of IFN-α/β and IFN-λ in immune responses during various viral infections, including influenza and infectious bronchitis virus (IBV). The knowledge gained from these studies is fundamental for developing therapeutic methods and immunomodulatory strategies to control and eradicate the significant public health challenges in avian species.</p>

<title>Successful generation of IFN receptor KO chickens</title>
<p>Knocking out the IFNAR1 or IFNLR1 receptors generates animal models deficient in type I or type III IFN signaling, respectively. This receptor-targeted approach, in contrast to the cytokine-targeted approach, is especially effective in chickens, where multiple IFN-α genes exist, as it blocks the entire signaling pathway, allowing for comprehensive studies of IFN’s roles in immunity and viral responses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. Chickens lacking either the receptor of IFN-α/β (IFNAR1) or IFN-λ (IFNLR1) were generated by designing guide RNAs to target the coding region within exon 1 of the IFNAR1 chain of the IFN-α/β receptor and the epithelium-specific chain (IFNLR1) of the IFN-λ receptor. PGCs, precursors of sperms and oocytes, were co-transfected with a CRISPR/Cas9 vector expressing a single guide RNA and Cas9-2A-eGFP targeting the coding region within exon 1 of the respective receptor genes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a, b</xref>). To generate the IFNAR1 knockout, homology-directed repair (HDR) utilizing single-stranded oligodeoxynucleotide (ssODN) templates was used to facilitate the targeted gene edits. Transient expression of eGFP in transfected PGCs allowed for the selection of successfully transfected cells via automated cell sorting. Subsequent Sanger sequencing confirmed several clonal PGCs lines with the desired modifications for IFNAR1 and IFNLR1.</p>

<p>For IFNLR1, the PGC clone with the largest deletion (28 bp) was selected, leading to a stop codon formation after 87 bp. Similarly, for IFNAR1, the clone with a 7 bp deletion produced a stop codon after 21 bp (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a, b</xref>). These clones were used for the generation of germline chimeras. Selected chimeric roosters demonstrated 4% and 7% germline transmission rates for IFNAR1 and IFNLR1 modifications, respectively, resulting in heterozygous IFNAR1<sup>+/−</sup> and IFNLR1<sup>+/−</sup> progeny. The modified alleles segregated in a Mendelian manner, and homozygous IFNAR1<sup>−/−</sup> and IFNLR1<sup>−/−</sup> lines were successfully established. TaqMan allelic discrimination assays were employed to genotype the IFNAR1 KO animals (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>), while a PCR genotyping assay was established for IFNLR1 KO chickens (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d</xref>). Phenotypically, both IFNAR1<sup>−/−</sup> and IFNLR1<sup>−/−</sup> chickens exhibited normal body weight gain compared to their WT counterparts (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>). Since both type I IFN and type III IFN play crucial roles in protecting the female reproductive tract against viral infections and maintaining immune homeostasis in mammals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>, we evaluated the fertility of IFNAR1<sup>−/−</sup> and IFNLR1<sup>−/−</sup> chickens by breeding homozygous birds from each line separately. The resulting F2 generation revealed normal egg production and fertility in healthy, unchallenged KO chickens (data not shown), consistent with studies in mice lacking either IFNAR1<sup>−/−</sup> or IFNLR1<sup>−/−2</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>.</p>

<title>Knockout of IFNAR1 and IFNLR1 impairs IFN signaling and induction of antiviral state</title>
<p>Western blot analysis confirmed the functional loss of the IFNAR1 receptor in the IFNAR1<sup>−/−</sup> chickens. Treatment with recombinant IFN-α resulted in the induction of IFN-stimulated protein Mx in WT and IFNAR1<sup>+/−</sup> chicken embryo fibroblasts (CEF) but not in the CEF derived from IFNAR1<sup>−/−</sup> embryos (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref>). In addition, treatment of both WT and IFNAR1<sup>−/−</sup> embryos with recombinant IFN- α before WSN33 (H1N1) challenge resulted in a significant (P ≤ 0.05) reduction of viral titers in the allantoic fluid of WT but not in IFNAR1<sup>−/−</sup> embryos (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref>). These results demonstrated that the signaling pathway mediated by IFNAR1 is non-functional in the absence of this receptor, thus validating the knockout model. Additionally, RT-PCR analysis was conducted to assess the expression of IFNLR1 (IL-28Rα) across multiple tissues, including the spleen, liver, lung, intestine, bursa of Fabricius, heart, and cecum in WT, IFNLR1<sup>+/−</sup>, and IFNLR1<sup>−/−</sup> embryos. The analysis revealed a complete absence of IFNLR1 mRNA in all IFNLR1<sup>−/−</sup> tissues compared to detectable levels in WT and IFNLR1<sup>+/−</sup> samples. This absence indicates the successful functional loss of IFNLR1 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d</xref>).</p>

<title>Reduced IgM and IgY production in IFNAR1<sup>−/−</sup> and IFNLR1<sup>−/−</sup> chickens following immunization</title>
<p>To study the role of type I and type III IFNs in immune response and antibody production, one- month-old chicks were immunized with Keyhole Limpet Hemocyanin (KLH) (Supplementary Fig. 3). Analysis of total IgM and IgY concentrations in the plasma of preimmunized animals (day 0) revealed a significantly (P ≤ 0.05) reduced IgY synthesis and secretion in IFNAR1<sup>−/−</sup> chickens compared to the WT group. Furthermore, all groups showed significant (P ≤ 0.05) increases in total IgM and IgY concentrations on day 5 after both primary and secondary immunizations compared to day 0. These elevations were solely attributed to immunization with KLH and FIA (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a, b</xref>). Analysis of KLH- specific IgM and IgY levels showed significantly (P ≤ 0.05) lower levels of both antibodies in IFNAR1<sup>−/−</sup> and IFNLR1<sup>−/−</sup> chicks compared to the WT group. Notably, although IFNLR1<sup>−/−</sup> chicks had significantly (P ≤ 0.05) lower IgM and IgY levels than IFNAR1<sup>−/−</sup> on day 5 post-primary immunization, they were able to reach immunoglobulin levels comparable to WT chicks by day 5 after booster immunization (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4c, d</xref>). This indicates that IFN-λ contributes to the initial antibody production following immunization but can be compensated for by type I IFN during booster immunization.</p>

<title>IFNAR1 knockout reduces MHCII<sup>+</sup> cells without altering MHCII expression</title>
<p>Analysis of splenocytes isolated on day 5 post-secondary immunization revealed a significant (P ≤ 0.05) reduction in the frequency of MHCII<sup>+</sup> cells in IFNAR1<sup>−/−</sup> chickens compared to other genotypes. This decrease was particularly pronounced in specific immune cell subsets, notably MHCII<sup>+</sup> B cells and MHCII<sup>+</sup> monocytes, where the percentages of these cells were markedly lower in IFNAR1<sup>−/−</sup> chickens (Supplementary Figs. 4 and 5). Interestingly, the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of MHCII, which indicates the density of MHCII molecules on individual cells, remained consistent across all experimental groups (data not shown). This observation suggests that the observed reduction in MHCII<sup>+</sup> cells is primarily due to a decrease in the overall populations of monocytes and B cells expressing MHCII rather than a diminished expression of MHCII per cell.</p>

<title>Quantitative reduction in the response of TRBV2-1-expressing T cells in immunized IFNAR1<sup>−/−</sup> animals</title>
<p>Next, we characterized the αβ T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire to assess whether T cell responses differ between IFNAR1<sup>−/−</sup>, IFNLR1<sup>−/−</sup>, and WT animals. Additionally, we aimed to determine if antibody responses to KLH are associated with clonal T-cell responses, potentially indicating T- dependent antibody responses. Both α and β chains were sequenced from T cells derived from the spleen at day 5 post-booster immunization from all three groups. Unimmunized chickens from each genotype were included to establish a baseline for the expression of TCRs. Interestingly, the TCR repertoires across genotypes and immunization groups were remarkably similar for both α and β chains, as indicated by the pairing of V-J gene segments (Supplementary Figs. 6 and 7). This suggests that the global repertoires are consistent across different genotypes after immunization. Given the greater diversity of β chains compared to α chains, resulting from the recombination of V, D, and J gene segments, we focused on β chains for the subsequent analyses of CDR3 clonotypes. CDR3 spectratypes exhibited a Gaussian-like distribution in both control and immunized chickens across all genotypes, suggesting that KLH does not induce major clonal expansions in the splenic TCR repertoire 5 days after booster immunization (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5a</xref>). This was confirmed by the analysis of clonotype frequencies, which predominantly consisted of rare clonotypes with only a few moderately expanded clonotypes observed in both control and immunized chickens (Supplementary Fig. 8). Although overall Vβ gene usage was similar in control and immunized chickens, TRBV2-1 was significantly less prevalent in KLH-immunized IFNAR1<sup>−/−</sup> chickens than in WT immunized animals (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5b</xref>). This suggests a reduced response of TRBV2-1-expressing T cells to KLH in IFNAR1- deficient chickens. To investigate whether specific amino acid motifs were enriched in KLH- immunized WT but not in IFNAR1<sup>−/−</sup> chickens, we analyzed the counts of 3-mer sequence motifs in TRBV2-1 CDR3 clonotypes, normalized by the total number of TRBV2-1 CDR3 sequences in each sample. Overall, the most prevalent 3-mers in immunized WT chickens were also present in immunized IFNAR1<sup>−/−</sup> chickens, indicating that TRBV2-1 clonotypes in IFNAR1<sup>−/−</sup> chickens are qualitatively similar to those in WT chickens (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5c</xref>). The observed differences are therefore more likely attributed to quantitatively reduced activation rather than distinct clonotype compositions.</p>

<p>To investigate the role of type I and type III IFNs in the defense mechanisms against viral infections, an <italic>in ovo</italic> challenge experiment was performed using 11-day-old embryos (Supplementary Fig. 9). This experiment utilized four distinct viral strains: a laboratory-adapted human influenza A virus (H1N1), two low pathogenic avian influenza A virus strains (H3N1 and H9N2), and infectious bronchitis virus (IBV)- Beaudette strain, an important avian gamma coronavirus. A significant (P ≤ 0.05) increase in WSN33 (H1N1) viral titers in the allantoic fluid was observed in IFNAR1<sup>−/−</sup> and IFNLR1<sup>−/−</sup> embryos compared to WT embryos, indicating a crucial role for both type I and type III IFN signaling in restricting WSN33 replication.

This was evident in IFNLR1<sup>−/−</sup> embryos challenged with H9N2, which exhibited poor survival rates compared to WT and IFNAR1<sup>−/−</sup> embryos despite having low viral titers. Similarly, the heightened type I IFN response likely explains the rapid death of IBV- challenged embryos within 24-36 hours post-infection. In contrast, embryos infected with influenza strains survived longer, lasting 4-5 days after infection (Supplementary Fig. 10).

The interaction with the IFNAR1 receptor is needed for the secreted IFN-α/β to mediate its function. The knockout of IFNAR1 led to a significant decrease in this group’s antiviral state. Relative mRNA expression of antiviral genes induced by IFN, including viperin, ISG12, IFITM5, PKR, and STAT1, reflects significantly (P ≤ 0.05) lower antiviral state in the IFNAR1<sup>−/−</sup> group as compared to WT and IFNLR1<sup>−/−</sup> hens. These results indicate that IFN-α/β can compensate IFN-λ to induce an adequate antiviral state during H3N1 infection. However, IFN-λ can not compensate for IFN-α/β in the spleen (Supplementary Fig. 12b). In WT cells, negative feedback mechanisms mediated by suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 (SOCS1) and Src Homology 2-containing Phosphatase 2 (SHP2) regulate the secretion of IFN and associated inflammation once an adequate antiviral state is achieved. In IFNAR1<sup>−/−</sup> cells, a low antiviral state, and high viral titers likely prevent the efficient activation of the negative feedback loop, as indicated by the reduced expression of SOCS1 and SHP2 (Supplementary Fig. 12c). Consequently, this leads to the continuous and significant secretion of IFN-α/β (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>).</p>

<p><bold>a,</bold> Immune signaling pathway in WT epithelial cells during an H3N1 viral infection. The cleaved hemagglutinin (HA) proteins of H3N1 bind to sialic acid receptors on the surface of epithelial cells, facilitating viral entry through endocytosis (1). The viral RNA inside the endosome is recognized by toll-like receptors (TLRs) (2), leading to the activation of the MYD88 signaling pathway (3) and melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA5) and/or laboratory of genetics and physiology 2 (LGP2) (4). In the MDA5/LGP2 pathway, mitochondrial antiviral-signaling proteins (MAVS) are activated. The activation of MYD88 leads to the recruitment of IRAK1/4 and TRAF6/3, which then stimulate the transcription factors nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB), interferon regulatory factor 7 (IRF7) and activating protein 1 (AP-1) (5). These transcription factors induce the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and type I and type III IFNs (6). Type I IFN (IFN-α/β) binds to its receptors (IFNAR1/2) by autocrine and paracrine signaling (7). This binding activates the JAK-STAT pathway, leading to the phosphorylation of signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs). These STATs translocate to the nucleus and activate the transcription of interferon-stimulated response elements (ISREs). The activation of ISREs drives the expression of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), establishing a robust antiviral state that effectively halts viral replication and spread within the cell (8). Similarly, type III IFN (IFN-λ) contributes to the antiviral state by binding to its receptors (IL-28Rα /IL-10Rβ) and activating the JAK-STAT pathway in an autocrine or paracrine manner (9). The immune response is tightly regulated by negative feedback mechanisms, including suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS1) and Src Homology 2-containing Phosphatase 2 (SHP2), which inhibit further production of IFNs and prevent excessive inflammatory responses (10). This response ensures that any initial viral replication is quickly suppressed, protecting the cell from significant infection and excessing immune responses that could lead to cytokine storm. The viral replication is significantly halted since the cells are in an antiviral state. <bold>b,</bold> Immune signaling pathway in IFNAR1<sup>−/−</sup> epithelial cells. Virus entry to the cell, recognition of viral RNA by the host cell, and induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines and IFNs happen in a mechanism similar to the WT cell (steps 1-6). However, without IFNAR1, IFN-α/β cannot bind to its receptors, disrupting downstream signaling and feedback inhibition, leading to unregulated IFN production and poor antiviral state (7). Higher IFN-λ is produced to compensate for the low antiviral state but cannot compensate for the absence of IFN-α/β (8). This makes the infected and neighboring cells easy targets for the H3N1 virus that can replicate quickly without resistance. Once inside the cell in the endosome, the viral RNA is released and transported into the nucleus for replication and transcription (9). Newly formed viral particles assemble, bud off, and are released to infect additional cells (10). In the absence of IFNAR1 and an antiviral state, the autocrine feedback loop mediated by SOCS1 and SHP2 is disrupted, and thus, the production of IFN-α/β is continuously increasing (11). The extensive pro-inflammatory cytokines and IFN production exacerbate inflammatory responses and cell death.</p></caption>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Interferons are crucial components of the innate immune system, playing a pivotal role in host defense against viral, bacterial, and other pathogenic insults. In mammals, the potent antiviral activities induced by IFNs have rendered them attractive therapeutic agents for bolstering the immune response against infections and diseases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>. Notably, both IFN-α/β and IFN-λ have demonstrated potential as adjuvants to enhance the efficacy of mucosal vaccines, particularly against respiratory viruses like influenza in murine models<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>. Developing novel therapeutic approaches to combat and eradicate viral and bacterial infections in poultry necessitates a comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms of action of type I and type III IFNs. To investigate this further, we have generated type I and type III IFN receptors knockout chickens to elucidate their potential roles in controlling avian influenza and other avian viral diseases. The IFNAR1<sup>−/−</sup> and IFNLR1<sup>−/−</sup> chickens exhibited normal growth and development compared to their WT counterparts. Flow cytometry analysis of the immune cell population in blood, spleen, and plasma concentrations of immunoglobulins indicate that IFN-α/β plays a crucial role in regulating innate immune cells, T cell subsets, and their contribution to antibody production under homeostatic conditions.</p>
<p>Both IFNAR1<sup>−/−</sup> and IFNLR1<sup>−/−</sup> chickens exhibited impaired antibody production in response to KLH immunization. Phagocytosis and antigen processing are augmented in a properly functioning interferon system, contributing to efficient antibody production in chickens<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>. In avian species, macrophages and B cells are well-characterized antigen-presenting cells (APCs) that express MHCII molecules and present antigens to CD4<sup>+</sup> T helper cells, leading to antibody production<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>. On day 5 after booster immunization, the spleens of IFNAR1<sup>−/−</sup> chickens exhibited fewer B cells, monocytes, and MHCII<sup>+</sup> cells, including MHCII<sup>+</sup> B cells and MHCII<sup>+</sup> monocytes, than other genotypes. Loss of IFN sensing led to reduced regulatory T cell selection and reduced TCR repertoire diversity in a murine model<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>.</p>
<p><italic>In ovo</italic> challenge of both IFNAR1<sup>−/−</sup> and IFNLR1<sup>−/−</sup> embryos revealed a complex interplay between chicken IFN signaling and viral pathogenesis, demonstrating that susceptibility to infection and subsequent immune responses highly depend on viral species and strain. Increased susceptibility and poor restrictions of viral replication in IFN receptor knockout embryos were observed only for WSN33 (H1N1) strain. At the same time, no significant differences in viral titer were noted between the groups in response to H3N1. The case of low pathogenic avian H9N2 virus is particularly intriguing. Despite causing comparatively few deaths, H9N2 has garnered significant attention due to its potential genetic exchange with emerging zoonotic influenza viruses such as H7N9 and H10N8 subtypes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup>. Interestingly, we observed that reduced H9N2 titers in IFNLR1<sup>−/−</sup> did not correlate with improved embryo survival compared to other genotypes. This finding highlights the critical role of chicken IFN-λ as anti-inflammatory cytokines in maintaining immune balance during the antiviral defense against H9N2. These observations align with previous studies in mice, where IFNLR1<sup>−/−</sup> animals exhibited a mild phenotype when infected with influenza virus, suggesting a complementary role of type III IFN to type I IFN in controlling influenza infection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Although H3N1 is classified as a low pathogenic avian influenza A virus due to its monobasic hemagglutinin cleavage site, it has shown high virulence in adult layers, causing severe clinical infections and mortality<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>. Researchers revealed that H3N1 can rapidly replicate and disseminate systemically in chickens due to a neuraminidase mutation that activates plasminogen-mediated hemagglutinin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup>. This mechanism mimics highly pathogenic strains and raises concerns about potential zoonotic transmission, particularly given the history of H3 subtypes in human infections. The <italic>in vivo</italic> H3N1 infection in WT, IFNLR1<sup>−/−</sup> and IFNAR1<sup>−/−</sup> hens revealed significant differences in disease progression and immune responses, emphasizing the critical role of type I IFN signaling in the defense mechanism against this H3N1 strain.</p>
<p>Previous studies suggested that H3N1 replication in the oviduct is a critical factor in the onset of clinical disease and increased viral excretion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>. Our current study provides new insights into H3N1 pathogenesis. The IFNAR1<sup>−/−</sup> group displayed severe clinical symptoms and higher viral titers despite having intact oviducts and egg production. This observation suggests that H3N1 can establish infection and replicate independently of oviduct involvement, indicating a more complex pathogenic mechanism than previously thought. IFN-λ, initially described as an anti-inflammatory counterpart to type I IFN, is highly expressed by epithelial cells, which line the avian oviduct<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup>. Recent studies have revealed that mammalian IFN-λs can exert complex effects on innate and adaptive immunity, sometimes promoting inflammation in specific contexts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup>, which agrees with the lower and delayed severity of oviduct infection and tissue damage in IFNLR1<sup>−/−</sup> compared to the WT hens. This observation suggests a potential pro-inflammatory role for IFN-λ in the context of H3N1 infection in the avian oviduct. Similarly, mammalian type III IFNs can disrupt the lung epithelial barrier upon viral recognition, showing detrimental effects during chronic viral infection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. Moreover, IFN signaling, particularly IFN-λ, impairs lung repair by inducing p53 and inhibiting epithelial proliferation and differentiation in a mouse model of influenza infection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>SOCS1 and SHP2 are pivotal regulators of IFN signaling, playing a crucial role in maintaining a delicate balance between effective immune responses and homeostasis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup>. The lack of negative feedback mediated by SOCS1 and SHP2 in the IFNAR1<sup>−/−</sup> hens, due to the absence of an antiviral state and increased viral spread, led to a continuous and significant secretion of IFN-α/β. These results agree with several studies that reported IFNAR1<sup>−/−</sup> mice produce high levels of circulating IFNs. This phenomenon has been attributed to the lack of an IFNAR1 receptor to bind and internalize type I IFNs, reduced clearance of IFNs from circulation, and continued production of IFNs by cells in response to ongoing stimuli, resulting in their accumulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Type I IFNs are crucial in moderating leukocyte infiltration and the inflammatory cascade. However, disrupting the IFNAR1 receptor can lead to a dysregulated cytokine response and excessive inflammation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></sup>. In IFNAR1<sup>−/−</sup> hens, eliminating type I IFN signaling and unaffected expression of inflammatory cytokines allows the H3N1 virus to spread further. The increased presence of viral components in the system continuously amplifies inflammatory cytokine production, potentially leading to a cytokine storm. Our observations support this hypothesis, as we found increased mRNA expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the spleen of IFNAR1<sup>−/−</sup> hens, which indicates a clear activation of Th1 and Th22 pathways in these birds<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>. The simultaneous activation of multiple T helper cell subsets likely contributed to the rapid onset of severe symptoms observed in IFNAR1<sup>−/−</sup> hens. Over-induction of Th1 and Th22 responses can lead to significant tissue damage and chronic inflammation, potentially increasing the risk of autoimmune-like reactions when left unregulated. Regulatory T cells (Tregs) normally modulate these responses by producing anti-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-10 and TGF-β<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref></sup>. However, our findings of unchanged expression of genes associated with the Tregs (FOXP3, IL-10, TGF-β) suggest that Treg activation was insufficient in the IFNAR1<sup>−/−</sup> group.</p>
<p>Previous research on murine models has demonstrated that reduced inflammation can confer resistance to influenza infection, even in elevated viral loads<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref></sup>. These observations suggest that the inflammatory response triggered by the virus may play a more crucial role in influenza pathology than the viral burden itself. Based on this understanding, we propose that the heightened inflammatory response observed in IFNAR1<sup>−/−</sup> hens is a key factor in the increased pathology associated with H3N1 infection. Our findings indicate that the IFNAR1 receptor is critical for preserving the delicate balance between potent antiviral immunity and the potentially harmful consequences of unrestrained inflammatory responses.</p>
<p>The present study uncovered the critical roles of type I and III IFNs on antibody production and baseline immune cell populations in chickens. Furthermore, these knockout models revealed that type I and type III IFNs play distinct and crucial roles in modulating viral pathogenesis, immune responses, and tissue-specific effects during avian influenza infection. The roles of these IFNs are virus strain-specific, with type I IFN showing particular importance in early defense against H3N1 avian influenza. By dissecting the complexities of avian interferon responses, these chicken models are critical for developing more effective strategies to control avian viral infections, including avian influenza, impacting veterinary medicine and zoonotic disease control.</p>

Guide RNAs targeting the coding region within exon 1 of the IFNAR1 chain of the IFN-α/β receptor and the epithelium-specific chain (IFNLR1) of the IFN-λ receptor (Supplementary Table 1) were designed and cloned separately into the PX458-Cas 9 vector (Addgene, USA), which contains eGFP as a selectable marker. A single-stranded oligodeoxynucleotide (ssODN) (Supplementary Table 1) was synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies (IDT, Zellik, Belgium) to serve as a repair template for the IFNAR1 KO.

<p>After successful clonal selection, PGCs were genotyped to identify clones with a knockout. These clones were used to generate chimeric roosters. For IFNAR1, the INDEL was pre-designed using CRISPR-mediated HDR technology, resulting in a 7-bp deletion that produced a stop codon after 21 bp. For IFNLR1, the clone with the maximum deletion (28 bp) was selected as it allowed for the easy design of an IFNLR1 KO-specific PCR genotyping assay and produced a stop codon after 87 bp (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.1</xref> a,b).

<title>Western blot and RT-PCR to examine successful knockout of IFNAR1/IFNLR1</title>
<p>To confirm the deletion of IFNAR1, a western blot experiment was conducted to study the expression of Mx protein in chicken CEFs treated with recombinant IFN-α. CEFs were isolated following a previously established protocol from day 10-old embryos, with genotype confirmation through blood collection from a 0.5 cm² window in the eggshell that allowed access to the embryonic vasculature<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref></sup>. The CEFs were cultured and maintained as described earlier<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref></sup>. WT, IFNAR1<sup>+/−</sup>, and IFNAR1<sup>−/−</sup> CEFs (n = 3) were cultured in a 6-well plate and stimulated with recombinant IFN-α (500 U/ml) for 12 hours. A control group of CEFs was treated with CEF medium without recombinant IFN-α. Following the stimulation period, both control and treated CEF cells were trypsinized and collected for SDS- PAGE and Western Blot analysis to study the expression of chicken Mx protein (75 kDa) and the control protein chicken β-actin (42 kDa). Mouse anti-human monoclonal IgGκ antibodies targeting Mx (Merck, Germany) and mouse anti-chicken monoclonal IgG2b antibodies targeting β-actin (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Germany) were used as primary antibodies. HRP-conjugated donkey anti- mouse IgG was used as the secondary antibody (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Germany). Blots were developed with homemade ECL substrate, and the signal was detected using the Vilber Lourmat Fusion Fx system (Eberhardzell, Germany). Additionally, an experiment examined the absence of viral resistance in IFNAR1<sup>−/−</sup> embryos compared to WT embryos after stimulation with recombinant IFN-α. Day 10-old chicken embryos were stimulated with 1.5 × 10<sup>5</sup> U of recombinant IFN-α in 100 µl PBS 12 hours before and at the time of infection, while control groups did not receive IFN-α stimulation. All groups of embryos (four embryos per group) were infected with 1000 FFU of WSN33, and the viral load in the allantoic fluid was analyzed 24 hours post-infection by titration on the Madine-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells, as described earlier<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>To confirm the deletion of IL-28Rα (IFNLR1), various tissues (spleen, liver, lung, intestine, bursa, heart, and cecum) were collected from 18-day embryos of WT, IFNLR1<sup>+/−</sup>, and IFNLR1<sup>−/−</sup>. To ensure that the expression of IL-28Rα is induced, these embryos were challenged with 1000 FFU of H3N1 strain 12 hours before organ collection. The organ samples were rinsed with PBS and homogenized using a SpeedMill Homogenizer (Analytik Jena). After genotyping the embryos, RNA was isolated using the Trizol method (VWR, Germany)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref></sup>, followed by cDNA synthesis with the GoScript Reverse Transcription Mix (Promega, USA). PCR was conducted using β-actin primers (277-FW &amp; 278-RV) and IL-28Rα primers (1642-FW &amp; 1643-RV) (Supplementary Table 3). The PCR was performed with Firepol DNA Polymerase (Solis Biodyne, Estonia) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The PCR conditions were as follows: initial denaturation at 95°C for 3 min, followed by 40 cycles for β-actin or 35 cycles for IL-28Rα of 95°C for 30 seconds, 56°C for β- actin or 62°C for IL-28Rα for 30 seconds, and 72°C for 25 seconds.

<title>Experimental design</title>
<p>Various <italic>in vitro</italic>, <italic>in ovo</italic>, and <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments were conducted to characterize the IFNAR1<sup>−/−</sup> and IFNLR1<sup>−/−</sup> genetically modified lines. The first experiment aimed to study the impact of type I and III IFNs on growth development, immune response, and cecal microbiota. Heterozygous birds of each line were bred separately, resulting in WT, heterozygous, and homozygous birds for each line. At least 12 animals per group of WT, IFNAR1<sup>−/−</sup>, and IFNLR1<sup>−/−</sup> were included in the study. Six chicks per group were euthanized at the age of 1 month to examine differences in immune cell populations in blood and spleen. Cecal contents from IFNLR1<sup>−/−</sup> chickens and their WT siblings were collected for microbiota analysis. In the second experiment, the ability of IFNAR1<sup>−/−</sup> and IFNLR1<sup>−/−</sup> chickens to respond to immunization and secrete antibodies was investigated. Five-week-old WT, IFNLR1<sup>−/−</sup>, and IFNAR1<sup>−/−</sup> chicks were immunized via intramuscular injection with 300 µg KLH, mixed 1:1 with incomplete Freund’s adjuvant. A booster injection of 300 µg KLH, mixed 1:1 with Freund’s incomplete adjuvant, was administered two weeks after the initial immunization. Plasma samples were collected from all groups before immunization (day 0), on day five post-primary immunization (PP), and on days 3 and 5 post-booster immunization (PB). The total concentration of IgM, IgY, and levels of KLH antigen-specific IgM and IgY were assessed using ELISA. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated on day three post-PP, and splenocytes were isolated on day 5 PB for FACS analysis of immune and MHC-positive cells. Spleen samples were used to study TCR repertoire. At least six animals per group were included (Supplementary Fig. 3).</p>
<p>In the third experiment, an <italic>in ovo</italic> study was conducted to examine the effects of IFNAR1 and IFNLR1 knockout on viral replication, survival probability, Mx and IFNλ mRNA expression, as well as IFN-α/β concentrations in WT, IFNLR1<sup>−/−</sup>, and IFNAR1<sup>−/−</sup> embryos (Supplementary Fig. 9). Fertilized eggs from a crossing of heterozygous roosters and hens of each line was collected and incubated until embryonic day 11 (ED11). The eggs were infected with 1,000 FFU of different influenza strains (WSN33(H1N1)/H3N1/H9N2) and infectious bronchitis virus (IBV)- Beaudette strain separately, as described previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref></sup>. The experiment was performed blindly, and the genotype of embryos was determined, and only WT and homozygous embryos were selected for further analysis. Details about the viral strains used in this study are provided in Supplementary Table 4. Twenty-four hours post-infection, the allantois fluid and breast tissue were collected for viral titration and genotyping, respectively. The CAM was also sampled 24 hours post-infection for gene expression studies. As previously described, the viral titers of WSN33, H3N1, and H9N2 were quantified by titration on MDCK cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref></sup>. For IBV, qPCR was used to measure the viral expression in the CAM (Supplementary Table 3). The relative mRNA expression of Mx and IFNλ was measured in the CAM. IFN-α/β concentration was quantified by titration of allantoic fluids on CEC-32 #511 reporter cells expressing firefly luciferase under the control of the chicken Mx promoter<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref></sup>.

<p>In the fourth experiment, the antiviral and immunomodulatory properties of type I and type III IFNs in the defense against H3N1 were characterized under <italic>in vivo</italic> conditions (Supplementary Fig. 11). The experimental groups consisted of WT, IFNLR1<sup>−/−</sup>, and IFNAR1<sup>−/−</sup> hens, with 10 hens in each group. Seven hens per group were infected with H3N1, while the remaining three were negative controls. The hens, 27 weeks old and actively laying eggs, received an infectious dose 10<sup>6</sup> FFU of H3N1 in 0.2 ml PBS per hen via nasal and tracheal routes on day 0. The H3N1 virus (A/Chicken/Belgium/460/2019) was provided by Dr. Joris Pieter De Gussem (Poulpharm BV). All IFNAR1<sup>−/−</sup> hens (n = 7) were euthanized by day 2 post-infection due to early and severe symptoms. In comparison, four WT hens were euthanized on day 5, two on day 6, and one on day 7 post-infection. Similarly, five IFNLR1<sup>−/−</sup> hens were euthanized on day 5 and two on day 7 post-infection based on symptom severity. Cloacal and tracheal swabs for viral RNA loads by RT-qPCR<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref></sup> and blood samples for quantifying plasma IFN-α/β concentrations are taken on day 0 (all groups), day 2 (only IFNAR1<sup>−/−</sup>), day 3 (WT and IFNLR1<sup>−/−</sup>), and day 5-7 post-infection (WT and IFNLR1<sup>−/−)</sup> based on the appearance and severity of symptoms. Blood plasma IFN-α/β concentrations were quantified using luciferase assay as described in experiment 3. Spleen samples were collected from all the infected animals for gene expression study. The oviducts were also collected from all the hens to study the impact of type I and type III IFN on the pathogenesis of H3N1 (Supplementary Fig. 11).</p>

The spleens were mechanically dissociated through a 100 μm cell strainer into a falcon tube containing 5 ml of PBS to generate a single-cell suspension of splenic cells. The detailed panel of primary and secondary antibodies employed for the identification and characterization of B cells, monocytes, γδ T cells (TCR1), αβ T cells (TCR2 + TCR3), and CD4-CD8 T cell subsets in experiment 1 is provided in Supplementary Table 5. Similarly, the antibody panel utilized for the analysis of B cells, monocytes, γδ T cells (TCR1), αβ T cells (TCR2 + TCR3), major histocompatibility complex class I (MHCI), and class II (MHCII), MHCII+ B cells, and MHCII+ monocytes in experiment 2 are detailed in Supplementary Table 5. Briefly, 5 x 10<sup>6</sup> cells per sample were washed with 1% BSA diluted in PBS (FLUO-Buffer). To discriminate viable cells, the samples were incubated with Fixable Viability Dye eFluor 780 (eBioscience, Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA). Following a wash step with FLUO-Buffer, the cells were incubated with primary antibodies for 20 min, rewashed with FLUO-Buffer, and subsequently incubated with conjugated secondary antibodies for 20 min. After a final wash step, the cells were analyzed using the AttuneNXT flow cytometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref></sup>. Data analysis was performed using FlowJo 10.8.1 software (FlowJo, Ashland, USA). Representative gating strategies employed for the first and second experiments are illustrated in Supplementary Figs. 1 and 5, respectively.</p>

<title>Microbiome analysis</title>
<p>Cecum content was taken from 4-week-old WT and IFNLR1<sup>−/−</sup> chickens. The caeca were isolated from the rest of the intestine, and one cecum was cut open longitudinally. The content was collected using sterile 10µl inoculation loops and transferred to 2 ml lysing matrix B tubes (MP Biomedicals) filled with 1 ml DNA Stool Stabilizer (Invitek Diagnostics, Germany). The remaining digesta was cautiously removed and the mucosa was scrapped with the inoculation loop to transfer mucosa- associated bacteria. Samples were kept on ice and brought to the laboratory within 2h after collection.</p>
<p>DNA was extracted and processed at the TUM Core Facility Microbiome. In brief, following mechanical cell lysis, DNA was purified on columns (Machery-Nagel, Düren, Germany). The V3/V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene was amplified by 25 cycles of a two-step PCR with primers 341FW and 785RV using a combinatorial dual-barcoding strategy. Amplicon libraries were sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq (Illumina, San Diega, USA) following the manufacturer’s instructions. A detailed description of DNA isolation, library preparation, and sequencing can be found elsewhere<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref></sup>. Raw sequence reads were processed using IMNGS2 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.imngs2.org">www.imngs2.org</ext-link>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref></sup>, a platform based on UPARSE<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref></sup>. Zero-radius operational taxonomic units (zOTUs) were calculated, and a 0.25% abundance filter was applied. The IMNGS2-created output files were further processed using RHEA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref></sup>, a modular pipeline for analyzing microbial profiles based on the 16S rRNA gene. Sequence reads were normalized using the normalization script in RHEA, and sequencing depth was sufficient, as depicted by the rarefaction curve (Supplementary Fig. 2a).</p>

<title>Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)</title>
<p>ELISA was performed according to an earlier protocol with minor modifications<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref></sup>. For the quantification of total plasma IgM and IgY levels, 96-well maxisorp non-immuno ELISA plates (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Germany) were coated overnight at 4°C with 2 μg/ml goat anti-chicken IgM antibody (Bethyl Laboratories) or 2 μg/ml rabbit anti-chicken IgY antibody (Sigma-Aldrich, Darmstadt, Germany). Subsequently, the plates were blocked with PBS containing 4% skim milk and incubated with chicken plasma samples. Purified IgM (Rockland) at a concentration of 10 μg/ml and IgY (Jackson IR) at 2.9 μg/ml were used as standards. Bound IgM or IgY were detected using goat anti-chicken IgM-horseradish peroxidase (HRP) conjugate (Bethyl Laboratories) or rabbit anti- chicken IgY-HRP conjugate (Sigma-Aldrich, Darmstadt, Germany), respectively, followed by development with 3,3’,5,5’-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) substrate (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Germany). The OD was measured using a FluoStar Omega microplate reader (BMG LABTECH, Ortenberg, Germany) at a wavelength of 450 nm with a reference filter of 620 nm (Version 5.91 5.70 R2). To determine antigen-specific IgM and IgY levels, the ELISA plates were coated with 2 μg/ml KLH (Sigma-Aldrich, Darmstadt, Germany) or BSA, and subsequent steps were performed as described for the detection of total plasma IgM and IgY, without the inclusion of purified immunoglobulin standards.</p>

<title>RNA isolation, cDNA synthesis, and qRT-PCR</title>
<p>Total RNA was isolated from the CAM and spleen using the Trizol method (VWR, Germany)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref></sup>. The concentration of the extracted RNA was assessed by measuring the absorbance ratio at 260/280 nm using a Biospec-nano Spectrophotometer. An absorbance ratio between 1.9 and 2.0 was considered indicative of pure RNA. Bioanalyzer Systems 6000 nano kit was also used to measure RNA integrity, and only RIN values above 7 were considered for further processing. Subsequently, 400 ng of RNA was reverse transcribed into complementary DNA (cDNA) using the GoScript™ Reverse Transcription Mix and Random Primers (Promega, USA), following the manufacturer’s protocol. The primer sequences used to analyze various gene expressions in the CAM and spleen are provided in Supplementary Table 6. A no-template control (NTC), containing PCR-grade water instead of the sample, was included to detect potential contamination. Real-time quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) was performed using the QuantStudio5 system (QuantStudio™ Design&amp;analysis Software v1.5.2, Thermo Fisher Scientific) and the Promega GoTaq qRT-PCR kit (Promega, USA), following the manufacturer’s instructions. The annealing temperature for all the studied genes was 59°C. The expression of each gene was analyzed in triplicate and normalized to the 18S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene, which served as the housekeeping reference. For the third experiment, the mRNA abundance in unchallenged WT embryos was used to calculate the relative expression levels across all experimental groups. For the spleen analysis of H3N1 infection, the challenged WT group was used as a control. In addition, the genes that were downregulated in IFNAR1<sup>−/−</sup> were presented as log2. The relative quantification of the studied genes was done using the 2<sup>−ΔΔCt</sup> method.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This manuscript presents an extensive body of work and an outstanding contribution to our understanding of the IFN type I and III system in chickens. The research started with the innovative approach of generating KO chickens that lack the receptor for IFNα/β (IFNAR1) or IFN-λ (IFNLR1). The successful deletion and functional loss of these receptors was clearly and comprehensively demonstrated in comparison to the WT. Moreover, the homozygous KO lines (IFNAR1-/- or IFNLR1-/- ) were found to have similar body weights, and normal egg production and fertility compared to their WT counterparts. These lines are a major contribution to the toolbox for the study of avian/chicken immunology.</p>
<p>The significance of this contribution is further demonstrated by the use of these lines by the authors to gain insight into the roles of IFN type I and IFN-type III in chickens, by conducting in ovo and in vivo studies examining basic aspects of immune system development and function, as well as the responses to viral challenges conducted in ovo and in vivo.</p>
<p>Based on solid, state-of the-art methods and convincing evidence from studies comparing various immune system related functions in the IFNAR1-/- or IFNLR1-/- lines to the WT, revealed that the deletion of IFNAR1 and/or IFNLR1 resulted in:</p>
<p>
(1) impaired IFN signaling and induction of anti-viral state;</p>
<p>
(2) modulation of immune cell profiles in the peripheral blood circulation and spleen;</p>
<p>
(3) modulation of the cecum microbiome;</p>
<p>
(4) reduced concentrations of IgM and IgY in the blood plasma before and following immunization with model antigen KLH, whereby also line differences in the time-course of the antibody production were observed;</p>
<p>
(5) decrease in MHCII+ macrophages and B cells in the spleen of IFNAR1 KO chickens, although the MHCII-expression per cell was not affected in this line; and</p>
<p>
(6) reduction in the response of αβ1 TCR+ T cells of IFNAR1 KO chickens as suggested by clonal repertoire analyses.</p>
<p>These studies were then followed by examination of the role of type I and type III IFN in virus infection, using different avian influenza A virus strains as well as an avian gamma corona virus (IBV) in in ovo challenge experiments. These studies revealed: viral titers that reflect virus-species and strain-specific IFN responses; no differences in the secretion of IFN-α/β in both KO compared to the WT lines; a predominant role of type I IFN in inducing the interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) Mx; and that an excessive and unbalanced type I IFN response can harm host fitness (survival rate, length of survival) and contribute to immunopathology.</p>
<p>Based on guidance from the in ovo studies, comprehensive in vivo studies were conducted on host-pathogen interactions in hens from the three lines (WT, IFNAR1 KO, or IFNLR1 KO). These studies revealed the early appearance of symptoms and poor survival of hens from the IFNR1 KO line challenged with H3N1 avian influenza A virus; efficient H#N1 virus replication in IFNAR1 KO hens, increased plasma concentrations of IFNα/β and mRNA expression of IFN-λ in spleens of the IFNAR1 KO hens; a pro-inflammatory role of IFN-λ in the oviduct of hens infected with H3N1 virus; increased proinflammatory cytokine expression in spleens of IFNAR1 KO hens, and Impairment of negative feedback mechanisms regulating IFN-α/β secretion in IFNAR1-KO hens and a significant decrease in this group's antiviral state; additionally it was demonstrated that IFN-α/β can compensate IFN-λ to induce an adequate antiviral state in the spleen during H3N1 infection, but IFN-λ cannot compensate for IFN-α/β signaling in the spleen.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) Both the methods and results from the comprehensive, well-designed, and well-executed experiments are considered excellent. The results are well and correctly described in the result narrative and well presented in both the manuscript and supplement Tables and Figures. Excellent discussion/interpretation of results.</p>
<p>(2) The successful generation of the type I and type III IFN KO lines offers unprecedented insight and opens multiple new venues for exploring the IFN system in chickens. The new knowledge reported here is direct evidence of the high impact of this model system on effectively addressing a critical knowledge gap in avian immunology.</p>
<p>(3) The thoughtful selection of highly relevant viruses to poultry and human health for the in ovo and in vivo challenge studies to examine and assess host-pathogen interactions in the IFNR KO and WT lines.</p>
<p>(4) Making use of the unique opportunities in the chicken model to examine and evaluate the host's IFN system responses to various viral challenges in ovo, before conducting challenge studies in hens.</p>
<p>(5) The new knowledge gained from the IFNAR1 and IFNLR1 KO lines will find much-needed application in developing more effective strategies to prevent health challenges like avian influenza and its devastating effects on poultry, humans, and other mammals.</p>
<p>(6) The excellent cooperation and contributions of the co-authors and institutions.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>No weaknesses were identified by this reviewer.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This study attempts to dissect the contributions of type I and type III IFNs to the antiviral response in chickens. The first part of the study characterises the generation of IFNAR and IFNLR KO chicken strains and describes basic differences. Four different viruses are then tested in chicken embryos, while the subsequent analysis of the antiviral response in vivo is performed with one influenza H3N1 strain.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Having these two KO chicken strains as a tool is a great achievement. The initial analysis is solid. Clear effect of IFNAR deficiency in in vivo infection, less so for IFNLR deficiency.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) The antibody induction by KLH immunisation: No data indicated whether or not this vaccination induces IFN responses in wt mice, so the effects observed may be due to steady-state differences or to differential effects of IFN induced during the vaccination phase. No pre-immune results are shown. The differences are relatively small and often found at only one plasma dilution - the whole of Figure 4 could be condensed into one or two panels by proper calculation of Ab titers - would these titres be significantly different? This, as all of the other in vivo experiments, has not been repeated, if I understand the methods section correctly.</p>
<p>(2) The basic conundrum here and in later figures is never addressed by the authors: Situations where IFN type 1 and 3 signalling deficiency each have an independent effect (i.e., Figure 4d) suggest that they act by separate, unrelated mechanisms. However, all the literature about these IFN families suggests that they show almost identical signalling and gene induction downstream of their respective receptors. How can the same signalling, clearly active here downstream of the receptors for IFN type 1 or type 3, be non-redundant, i.e., why does the unaffected IFN family not stand in? This is a major difference from the mouse studies, which showed a rather subtle phenotype when only one of the two IFN systems was missing, but a massive reduction in virus control in double KO mice (the correct primary paper should be quoted here, not only the review by McNab). Reasons could be a direct effect of IFNab on B cells and an indirect effect of IFNL through non-B cells, timing issues, and many other scenarios can be envisaged. The authors do not address this question, which limits the depth of analysis.</p>
<p>(3) In the one in vivo experiment performed with chickens, only one virus was tested; more influenza strains should be included, as well as non-influenza viruses.</p>
<p>(4) The basic conundrum of point 2 applies equally to Figure 6a; both KOs have a phenotype. Again in 6d, both IFNs appear to be separately required for Mx induction. An explanation is needed.</p>
<p>(5) Line 308, where are the viral titers you refer to in the text? The statement that the results demonstrate that excessive IFNab has a negative impact is overstretched, as no IFN measurements of the infected embryos are shown here.</p>
<p>(6) The in vivo infection is the most interesting experiment, and the key outcome here is that IFN type 1 is crucial for anti-H3N1 protection in chickens, while type 3 is less impactful. However, this experiment suffers from the different time points when chickens were culled, so many parameters are impossible to compare (e.g., weight loss, histopathology, IFN measurements, and more). Many of these phenomena are highly dynamic in acute virus infections, so disparate time points do not allow a meaningful comparison between different genotypes. What are the stats in 7b? Is the median rather than the mean indicated by the line? Otherwise, the lines appear in surprising places. SD must be shown, and I find it difficult to believe that there is a significant difference in weight, for e.g., IFNAR KO, unless maybe with a paired t test. What is the statistical test?</p>
<p>(7) Figures 7e,f: these comparisons are very difficult to interpret as the virus loads at these time points already differ significantly, so any difference could be secondary to virus load differences.</p>
