<title>Abstract</title><p>The entorhinal cortex (EC) connects to the hippocampus sending different information from cortical areas that is first processed at the dentate gyrus (DG) including spatial, limbic, and sensory and information. Excitatory afferents from lateral (LPP) and medial (MPP) perforant pathways of the EC connecting to granule cells of the DG play a role in memory encoding and information processing and are deeply affected in humans suffering Alzheimer’s disease and temporal lobe epilepsy, contributing to the dysfunctions found in these pathologies. The plasticity of these synapses is not well known yet, as are not known the forms of long-term depression (LTD) existing at those connections. We investigated whether spike timing-dependent long-term depression (t- LTD) exists at these two different EC-DG synaptic connections in mice, and whether they have different action mechanisms. We have found two different forms of t-LTD, at LPP- and MPP-GC synapses and characterised their cellular and intracellular mechanistic requirement. We found that both forms of t-LTD are expressed presynaptically and that whereas t-LTD at LPP-GC synapses does not require NMDAR, t-LTD at MPP-GC synapses requires ionotropic NMDAR containing GluN2A subunits. The two forms of t-LTD require different group I mGluR, mGluR5 LPP-GC synapses and mGluR1 MPP-GC synapses. In addition, both forms of t-LTD require postsynaptic calcium, eCB synthesis, CB1R, astrocyte activity, and glutamate. Thus, we discovered two novel forms of t-LTD that require astrocytes at EC-GC synapses.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The entorhinal cortex (EC) conveys spatial, limbic and sensory information to the hippocampus, a structure responsible for important activities in the brain including learning, memory and spatial information coding. Excitatory projections from the EC to the dentate gyrus (DG) play a role in memory encoding, and they are affected in humans suffering from Alzheimer Disease (AD) and temporal lobe epilepsy, contributing critically to these pathologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Paré et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Llorens-Martín et al., 2014</xref>). In rodents, evidence suggests that the lateral perforant pathway (LPP) conveys more sensory related information, whereas the medial perforant pathway (MPP) conveys information related to spatial location and limbic signals that are involved in attention and motivation. Evidence suggests that LPP- and MPP-GC synapses have distinct electrophysiological properties, these differences potentially affecting the functional processing of information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Krueppel et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Petersen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Kim et al., 2018</xref>). Indeed, these functional differences probably reflect their distinct inputs, as they contact the outer (LPP) or middle (MPP) third of the molecular layer of the DG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Paré et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Burgess et al., 2002</xref>). Significantly, MPP-GC synapses are associated with a higher probability of release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Min et al., 1998</xref>) and the existence and/or activity of presynaptic NMDARs, which differs between the two types of fibres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Savtchouk et al., 2019</xref>). Interestingly, LPP and MPP synapses appear to influence pathological changes distinctly, with the former showing changes in release probability in models of epilepsy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Scimemi et al., 2006</xref>), preferential β-amyloid deposition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Reilly et al., 2003</xref>), earlier susceptibility to AD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Khan et al., 2014</xref>) and reduced plasticity with age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Froc et al., 2003</xref>). The mechanistic bases of these differences are virtually unknown and they pose a challenge when attempting to understand circuit-specific biological computations, as well as the susceptibility to pathological insults. In addition, the forms of plasticity at these synapses remain unclear and the limited studies into plasticity available did not distinguish between these two pathways.</p>
<p>Plasticity drives the organization of cortical maps during development, and it underlies learning and memory (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Malenka and Bear, 2004</xref>). The most extensively studied forms of plasticity are long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) of synaptic transmission. Spike timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) is a Hebbian form of long-term synaptic plasticity found in all known nervous systems, from insects to humans. Indeed, STDP appears to be a synaptic mechanism that underlies circuit remodelling during development, and it is thought to be involved in learning and memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Dan and Poo, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Feldman, 2012</xref>). In STDP, the relative order and millisecond timing of pre- and postsynaptic action potentials (spikes/APs) determine the direction and magnitude of the synaptic changes. Thus, spike timing- dependent LTP (t-LTP) occurs when a postsynaptic spike follows a presynaptic spike within ms, whereas spike timing-dependent LTD (t-LTD) is induced when this order is reversed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Feldman, 2012</xref>). In addition, <italic>in vivo</italic> studies have suggested modifications to LTP and LTD after mice undertake behavioural tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Kemp and Manahan-Vaughan, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Clarke et al., 2010</xref>). However, it is surprising that while plasticity of EC-DG granule cell (GC) synapses has been studied using classical protocols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Froc et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Harney et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Hayashi et al., 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Savtchouk et al., 2019</xref>), no information exists as to whether STDP or t-LTD can be induced at these synapses.</p>
<p>Here we studied STDP at PP-GC synapses, differentiating the lateral and medial pathways, determining whether these individual synapses are subject to t-LTD and if this form of plasticity at these synapses influences learning, memory or information processing. As a result, we identified two different forms of presynaptic t-LTD at LPP- and MPP-GC synapses. Unlike LPP-GC synapses, the t-LTD at MPP-GC synapses requires ionotropic NMDARs that contain GluN2A subunits, and the t-LTD at each type of synapse require different group I mGluRs, with LPP-GC synapses dependent on mGluR5 and MPP-GC t-LTD requiring mGluR1. In addition, we found that both forms of t-LTD require postsynaptic calcium, endocannabinoid (eCB) synthesis, CB<sub>1</sub> receptor (CB<sub>1</sub>R) signalling, astrocytes and glutamate. Hence, we describe here two novel forms of presynaptic t-LTD in the brain at EC-GC synapses with different action mechanisms, probably implicated in the different aspects of information processing.</p>

<title>Animals and ethical approval</title>
<p>All animal procedures were conducted in accordance with the European Union Directive 2010/63/EU regarding the protection of animals used for scientific purposes, and they were approved by the Ethics Committee at the Universidad Pablo de Olavide and that of the Andalusian Government. C57BL/6 mice were purchased from Harlan Laboratories (Spain) and P13–21 (P, post-natal day) mice of either sex were used. Animals were kept at temperatures between 18 and 24 °C on a continuous 12 h light/dark cycle, and at 40–60% humidity, with ad libitum access to food and water. In some experiments, dominant-negative (dn) SNARE mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Pascual et al., 2005</xref>) of the same age were used. These mice were not fed with doxycycline from birth, the supplement that drives transgene expression. In these mice, the human glial fibrillary acidic protein (hGFAP) promoter mediates the specific expression of the tetracycline transactivator (tTA) in astrocytes, which in turn activates the tetracycline responsive element operator and drives the cytosolic expression of VAMP2/synaptobrevin II in these cells, along with the enhanced green fluorescence protein (eGFP). Expression of the dnSNARE transgene interferes with the formation of the SNARE complex, blocking exocytosis and impairing vesicle release by astrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Sultan et al., 2015</xref>).</p>

<title>Slice preparation</title>
<p>Hippocampal slices were prepared as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Andrade-Talavera et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Pérez-Rodríguez et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Falcón-Moya et al., 2020</xref>). Briefly, mice were anesthetized with isoflurane (2%), decapitated, and their whole brain was removed and placed in an ice-cold ACSF solution (pH 7.2, 300 mOsm*L<sup>-1</sup>) containing (in mM): 126 NaCl, 3 KCl, 1.25 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 2 MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 2 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 26 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, and 10 glucose. Slices (350 µm thick: Leica VT1000S Vibratome) were maintained oxygenated (95% O<sub>2</sub>/5% CO<sub>2</sub>) in the same solution for at least 1 h before use. Experiments were carried out at 33-34 °C and during the experiments; the slices were superfused continuously with the same solution indicated above.</p>

<title>Electrophysiological recordings</title>
<p>Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings of DG GCs were obtained under visual guidance by infrared differential interference contrast microscopy. The identity of the neurons was verified by their characteristic voltage response to a current step protocol applied in current-clamp configuration using a patch- clamp amplifier (Multiclamp 700B), and acquiring the data with pCLAMP 10.2 software (Molecular Devices). Patch-clamp electrodes were pulled from borosilicate glass tubes and had a resistance of 4-7 MΩ when filled with the intracellular solution consisting in(in mM, pH 7.2–7.3, 290 mOsm L<sup>−1</sup>): potassium gluconate, 110; HEPES, 40; NaCl, 4; ATP-Mg, 4; and GTP, 0.3. Only cells with a stable resting membrane potential below −55 mV were assessed, and the cell recordings were excluded from the analysis if the series resistance changed by &gt;15%. All recordings were low-pass filtered at 3 kHz and acquired at 10 kHz. For plasticity experiments, excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) were evoked alternately at 0.2 Hz in two input pathways, test and control, by using two monopolar stimulating electrodes placed 200-400 µm from the cell soma. Stimulating electrodes were situated on fibres contacting the distal and medial third of the dendritic arbour of GCs, corresponding to LPP- and MPP-GC synapses, respectively. Stimulation was adjusted (200 µs, 0.1-0.2 mA) to obtain an EPSP peak amplitude of 3-5 mV in control conditions. Pathway independence was ensured by the lack of cross-facilitation when the pathways were stimulated alternately at 50 ms intervals. Plasticity was assessed through the changes in the EPSP slope, measured in its rising phase as a linear fit between time points corresponding to 25-30% and 70-75% of the peak amplitude under control conditions. Miniature responses were recorded in the presence of tetrodotoxin (TTX, 300 nM).</p>

<sec id="s2d">
<title>Plasticity protocols</title>
<p>After establishing a stable basal EPSP over 10 min, the test input was paired 100 times with a single postsynaptic spike. The single postsynaptic spike was evoked by a brief somatic current pulse (5 ms, 0.1–0.5 pA), whereas the control pathway was left unstimulated during the pairing period. To induce t-LTD, a postsynaptic AP was evoked 18 ms before the onset of the EPSP. EPSP slopes were monitored for at least 30 min after the pairing protocol, and the presynaptic stimulation frequency remained constant throughout the experiment. In some experiments, “glutamate puffs” were applied using a Picospritzer (Parker Hannifin), expulsing glutamate dissolved in the external solution through a micropipette over an astrocyte in proximity to the LPP-GC or MPP-GC synapses at a pressure of 10 psi for 50–200 ms. In each experiment, 100 glutamate puffs were applied to the recording neuron at 0.2 Hz at baseline, 18 ms before the onset of the EPSP, which did not affect patch clamping. The EPSP slopes were then monitored for 30 min.</p>

<title>Drugs</title>
<p>The following agents were purchased from: Sigma-Aldrich - BAPTA, Zinc chloride, and the compounds used to prepare the ACSF and current clamp internal solutions; and Tocris Bioscience - MK-801 maleate, D-AP5, TTX, PPDA, Ro 25-6981 maleate, L-glutamic acid, MPEP, LY367385, LY341495, AM251, Orlistat (THL), FK506, Nimodipine, Thapsigargin and Ifenprodil. All compounds were dissolved in distilled water except for Nimodipine, Thapsigargin, PPDA, FK506, AM251 and THL, which were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2f">
<title>Data analysis</title>
<p>The data were analysed using the Clampfit 10.2 software (Molecular Devices) and the last 5 min of the recordings were used to estimate the changes in synaptic efficacy relative to the baseline. For the paired-pulse ratio (PPR) experiments, two EPSPs were evoked for 30 s at the baseline frequency, one at the beginning of the baseline recording (40 ms apart) and another 30 min after the end of the pairing protocol. The PPR was expressed as the slope of the second EPSP divided by the slope of the first EPSP. A Coefficient of Variation (CV) analysis was carried out on the EPSP slopes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Rodríguez-Moreno and Paulsen, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Falcón-Moya et al., 2020</xref>) and the noise- free CV of the EPSP slopes was calculated as:
<disp-formula id="eqn1">
<graphic xlink:href="586546v1_eqn1.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
where σ<sup>2</sup> (EPSP) and σ<sup>2</sup> (noise) are the variance of the EPSP and baseline, respectively. The plot compares the variation in the mean EPSP slope (M) to the change in response variance of the EPSP slope (1/CV<sup>2</sup>: see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Brock et al., 2020</xref> for a comprehensive explanation). Graphs were prepared using SigmaPlot 11.0.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2g">
<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>Before applying any statistical comparison, the data were subjected to Shapiro-Wilk normality and equal variance tests, applying a confidence interval (CI) of 95%. Unpaired or paired Student’s t-tests were used for comparisons between two groups. For multiple comparisons of more than two groups, one-way ANOVA was used followed by a Holm–Sidak <italic>post-hoc</italic> test (when necessary). All the data are expressed as the mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM) and P values were considered significant when &lt; 0.05: *p = 0.05, **p = 0.01, ***p = 0.001.</p>

<title>Pairing presynaptic activity with single postsynaptic action potentials at low frequency can induce t-LTD at mouse lateral and medial perforant pathway-dentate gyrus granule cell synapses</title>
<p>We initially determined whether spike timing-dependent LTD can be induced at perforant pathway-DG GC synapses by pairing presynaptic stimulation with single postsynaptic spikes at low frequency (0.2 Hz). We used a post-pre protocol, pairing a single postsynaptic spike followed 18 ms later by presynaptic stimulation 100 times, as described previously at cortical and hippocampal synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Andrade-Talavera et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Martínez-Gallego et al., 2022a</xref>). We monitored the EPSPs evoked by extracellular stimulation of the LPP- and MPP-GC synapses, which make synaptic contacts with the distal and medial third of the dendritic arbour of hippocampal DG GCs, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Petersen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Savtchouk et al., 2019</xref>). EPSPs were recorded from GCs using the current clamp mode of the whole-cell patch-clamp configuration (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a, k</xref>). A post- before-pre pairing protocol induced robust t-LTD at both LPP-GC (63 ± 5 %, n = 14: <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1b, c</xref>) and MPP-GC synapses (59 ± 5 %, n = 14: <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1l, m</xref>), while unpaired control pathways remained unaffected (103 ± 4 % and 105 ± 7 %, respectively: <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b, c, l, m</xref>).</p>

<p>(a, k) Schemes show the general set-up for the electrophysiological recordings and pairing protocol (Δt = -18 ms, time between the peak of the postsynaptic spike and the onset of the EPSP) at both LPP- and MPP-GC synapses: CA, <italic>cornus ammonis</italic>; DG, dentate gyrus; EC, entorhinal cortex; S1 and S2, stimulating electrodes; R, recording electrode. A post-before-pre pairing protocol induced t-LTD at both LPP-GC (b) and MPP-GC (l) synapses. The EPSP slopes monitored in the paired (LPP-GC synapses black triangles, n = 14; MPP- GC synapses open black triangles, n = 14) and unpaired (LPP-GC synapses red symbols; MPP-GC synapses open red symbols) pathways are shown. The traces show the EPSP before (1) and 30 minutes after (2) pairing. Depression was only observed in the paired pathways.

Traces show the EPSPs before (black) and 30 min after pairing (red). PPR increases after t-LTD pairing protocol at LPP-GC (e) and MPP-GC (o) synapses. The traces show the EPSP before (black) and 30 min after t- LTD induction (red). (f, p) Normalized plots of CV<sup>−2</sup> versus mean EPSP slopes yield data points mainly below the diagonal after t-LTD induction at both LPP- (n = 14) and MPP-GC (n = 13) synapses. The traces show the EPSPs before (black) and 30 min after t-LTD induction (red). Miniature EPSPs (mEPSPs) were monitored at baseline and after t-LTD induction in the presence of TTX (300 nM) at LPP- (g-j, n = 6) and MPP-GC synapses (q-t, n = 6). Cumulative graphs and histograms show that after t-LTD induction, the frequency of mEPSPs decreases at both types of synapses, whereas the amplitude of the mEPSPs remains constant.

<title>Presynaptic expression of t-LTD at lateral and medial perforant pathway-dentate gyrus granule cell synapses</title>
<p>We next determined the site where this t-LTD was expressed through several approaches. As we observed failures in synaptic transmission at both types of synapse, we analysed these and found that the number of failures increased consistently after t- LTD at both LPP-GC (from 43 ± 7 % at baseline to 76 ± 6 % after t-LTD, n = 8: <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d</xref>) and MPP-GC synapses (from 40 ± 5 % at baseline to 59 ± 4 % after t-LTD, n = 6: <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1n</xref>), suggesting a presynaptic mechanism. We then analysed the PPR at baseline and 30 min after the pairing protocol, identifying a significant increase in the PPR after t-LTD at both LPP-GC (from 1.16 ± 0.11 at baseline to 1.67 ± 0.19 after t-LTD, n = 14: <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1e</xref>) and MPP-GC synapses (from 1.17 ± 0.11 at baseline to 1.81 ± 0.15 % after t- LTD, n = 14: <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1o</xref>), again suggesting a presynaptic expression of these two forms of t-LTD. Third, we estimated the noise-subtracted CV of the synaptic responses before and after t-LTD induction. A plot of CV<sup>-2</sup> versus the change in the mean evoked EPSP slope (M) before and after t-LTD mainly yielded points below the diagonal line at LPP- GC and MPP-GC synapses (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1f, p</xref>), consistent with a modification of the release parameters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Rodríguez-Moreno and Paulsen, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Brock et al., 2020</xref>). Finally, we recorded and analysed the miniature responses (mEPSP) in the presence of tetrodotoxin (300 nM, TTX), before and after t-LTD, adding TTX at the baseline and washing it out before performing the t-LTD experiment, and then adding TTX again after t-LTD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Falcón-Moya et al., 2020</xref>). Under these conditions, a t-LTD similar to previous experiments was evident at both types of synapse (LPP-GC synapses 55 ± 11 %, n = 6; MPP-GC synapses 67 ± 8 %, n = 7), and we found that the frequency of mEPSPs decreased at both types of synapse after t-LTD induction: LPP-GC - baseline 1.4 ± 0.13 Hz, after t-LTD induction 0.7 ± 0.09 Hz, n = 6 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1g, i</xref>); and MPP-GC - baseline 1.2 ± 0.1 H, after t-LTD induction 0.7 ± 0.07 Hz, n = 8 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1q, s</xref>). No effect of TTX on mEPSP amplitude was evident at any of these synapses: LPP-GC - baseline 1.13 ± 0.09, after t-LTD 1.13 ± 0.02 mV, n = 5 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1h, j</xref>); MPP-GC - baseline 1.03 ± 0.07, after t- LTD 1.00 ± 0.09 mV, n = 6 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1r, t</xref>). These results again suggest a presynaptic locus for t-LTD expression. Hence, together these results are consistent with a decrease in the probability of neurotransmitter release and they are indicative of a presynaptic locus for these two forms of t-LTD at both types of synapse.</p>

<title>Presynaptic t-LTD requires NMDARs at MPP-GC but not at LPP-GC synapses</title>
<p>Different forms of t-LTD have been shown to require NMDARs at cortical synapses and in the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bender et al., 2006</xref>; Nevian and Sakman, 2006; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Rodríguez-Moreno and Paulsen, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Rodríguez-Moreno et al., 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">2013</xref>; Andrade- Talavera et al., 2016). To determine whether the two forms of t-LTD studied here require NMDARs, we treated slices with the NMDAR antagonists D-AP5 (50 µM) or MK-801 (500 µM), completely blocking NMDARs and NMDAR-mediated currents (from 57 ± 8 pA, n = 5). In these experimental conditions, t-LTD at LPP-GC synapses was not affected by these antagonists (D-AP5 66 ± 4 %, n = 8; MK-801 62 ± 9 %, n = 6; interleaved controls 60 ± 6 %, n = 8: <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a, b</xref>), whereas t-LTD at MPP-GC synapses was blocked in slices treated with either D-AP5 (90 ± 7 %, n = 10) or MK-801 (107 ± 10 %, n = 6) relative to the interleaved controls (60 ± 7 %, n = 8: <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2e, f</xref>).

These results indicate that while t-LTD at MPP-GC synapses requires NMDARs, t-LTD at LPP-GC synapses does not.

<p>To gain better insight into the mechanisms involved in t-LTD, we hypothesized that a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent enzyme might be involved. Since the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent protein phosphatase calcineurin has been implicated in synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Mulkey et al., 1994</xref>) and neocortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Torii et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Rodríguez-Moreno et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Andrade-Talavera et al., 2016</xref>), we tested the effect of inhibiting calcineurin on t-LTD. Accordingly, t-LTD induction was prevented at LPP-GC (110 ± 7 %, n = 8) but not MPP-GC synapses (72 ± 7 %, n = 6: Fig. S1) when the calcineurin blocker FK506 (10 µM) was added to the superfusion fluid, relative to the untreated interleaved controls (LPP-GC 66 ± 8 %, n = 7; MPP-GC 71 ± 7%, n = 6: Fig. S1). Subsequently, we loaded the postsynaptic neuron at LPP-GC synapses with FK506 and as t-LTD was no longer detected at these synapses (105 ± 11 %, n = 7: Fig. S1), postsynaptic calcineurin appears to be involved in t-LTD induction at LPP-GC but not MPP-GC synapses.</p>

<p>At these synapses it is thought that glutamate is released from astrocytes to modulate synaptic transmission and participate in plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Jourdain et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Savtchouk et al., 2019</xref>), as indicated for cortical synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Min and Nevian, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Martínez-Gallego et al., 2022a</xref>). To determine whether glutamate, probably released by astrocytes, is required for t-LTD at LPP- and MPP-GC synapses, we repeated the experiments in slices from dnSNARE mutant mice but applying glutamate puffs (100 µM) in the proximity of the astrocytes and neurons under study rather than pairing. In these experimental conditions, t-LTD, which was not evident in untreated dnSNARE mice (LPP-GC synapses 95 ± 5 %, n = 7; MPP-GC synapses 109 ± 6 %, n = 6) was fully recovered at both LPP-GC (72 ± 11 %, n = 6: <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4d, e</xref>) and MPP-GC synapses (70 ± 8 %, n = 6: <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4i, j</xref>) relative to the control interleaved slices from WT mice (LPP-GC synapses 62 ± 8 %, n = 7; MPP-GC synapses 64 ± 5 %, n = 7). These results indicate that glutamate, probably released by astrocytes as gliotransmitters, are necessary for the induction of t-LTD at LPP- and MPP-GC synapses.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, two new forms of t-LTD were seen to be elicited at LPP and MPP synapses onto DG GCs by pairing presynaptic activity with single postsynaptic APs at low frequency (0.2 Hz). Using different approaches, we found that these two forms of t- LTD are expressed presynaptically, not least through a decrease in the glutamate release probability. Interestingly, t-LTD induction at MPP-GC synapses but not at LPP-GC synapses depends on presynaptic NMDARs containing GluN2A subunits. In addition, mGluRs are required for t-LTD at both types of PP-DG synapses, although LPP-GC synapses require mGluR5 activation and MPP-GC synapses require mGluR1 activity. These two forms of presynaptic t-LTD require postsynaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup> released from postsynaptic intracellular stores and whereas t-LTD at LPP-GC synapses, requires calcineurin phosphatase activity; this is not the case at MPP-GC synapses. Both these two forms of t-LTD require eCB synthesis and CB<sub>1</sub>R activation, and both require astrocytes and astrocyte signalling to promote gliotransmitter release, as well as glutamate that is probably released by astrocytes.</p>
<p>While different time intervals between the postsynaptic spike and presynaptic EPSP of a pairing protocol may induce t-LTD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Feldman, 2012</xref>), it is clear here that pairing EPSPs of 3-5 mV size 100 times with single postsynaptic spikes 18 ms later at 0.2 Hz induces robust LTD at both LPP- and MPP-GC synapses. Interestingly, a similar protocol induces t-LTD at hippocampal CA3-CA1 synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Andrade-Talavera et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Pérez-Rodríguez et al., 2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Falcón-Moya et al., 2020</xref>) and at L4-L2/3 synapses of the somatosensory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Rodríguez-Moreno and Paulsen, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Banerjee et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Martínez-Gallego et al., 2022a</xref>), visual (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Larsen et al., 2014</xref>) and cingulate cortices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Hogrefe et al., 2022</xref>). As such, the results presented here extend the existence of t-LTD to LPP and MPP synapses onto hippocampal DG GCs. Although there are several uncertainties associated with quantal analysis in the CNS (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Brock et al., 2020</xref>), we used different approaches here to determine the locus of expression of these two forms of t-LTD (failure rate, PPRs, CV, and mEPSP frequency and amplitude analysis), all of which were consistent with presynaptic changes.</p>
<p>NMDARs are required for general synaptic plasticity and for STDP, and in different experimental models (cell cultures, rodent brain slices and human neurons) they are required for t-LTD and t-LTP at different synapses in the hippocampus, neocortex, cerebellum and striatum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Bi and Poo, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bender et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Nevian and Sakmann, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Banerjee et al., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Fino et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Verhoog and Mansvelder, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Kwag and Paulsen, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Andrade-Talavera et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Sgritta et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Louth et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Martínez-Gallego et al., 2022a</xref>). NMDARs have been implicated in synaptic plasticity at MPP-GC but not LPP-GC synapses through classical protocols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Dahl et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Min et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Beck et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Hayashi et al., 2014</xref>). Our results are consistent with the presence of NMDARs at MPP-GC synapses, in our case participating in LTD. Indeed, t-LTD is not present at MPP-GC synapses in the presence of D-AP5, and the presence of presynaptic NMDARs at MPP-GC synapses was demonstrated previously by immunogold labelling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Jourdain et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Savtchouk et al., 2019</xref>). At these synapses t-LTD was also blocked when MK801 was present in the bath but not when it was loaded into the postsynaptic neuron, indicating that the NMDARs necessary for t-LTD are not postsynaptic, as seen in L4-L2/3 synapses of the somatosensory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bender et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Nevian and Sakmann, 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Rodríguez-Moreno and Paulsen, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Rodríguez-Moreno et al., 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">2013</xref>) and visual cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Larsen et al., 2014</xref>). Since the NMDA channel blocker MK801 prevents t-LTD, the NMDARs required for t-LTD appear to be ionotropic, although an additional role for a postsynaptic metabotropic NMDARs cannot be ruled-out (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Nabavi et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, the involvement of NMDARs is one important difference between LPP- and MPP-GC synapses that may account for at least some of the physiological differences described between these two pathways. By using antagonists with different NMDAR subunit specificities, we also found that the NMDARs required for t-LTD at MPP-GC synapses contain GluN2A but not GluN2B or GluN2C/D subunits. NMDARs that enhance glutamate release or that participate in LTP at PP-GC synapses are thought to contain GluN2B subunits in rats as their effect is blocked by ifenprodil (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Jourdain et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Savtchouk et al., 2019</xref>). However, ifenprodil or Ro25698 had no effect on t-LTD here, such that the preNMDARs containing GluN2B subunits that participate in LTP and enhance glutamate release may differ from those participating in t-LTD, and there may even be differences between the species (i.e.: rat and mouse). Thus, while both forms of t-LTD described here appear to require group I mGluRs, they require different ones: mGluR5 at LPP-GC synapses and mGluR1 at MPP-GC contacts. Nevertheless, the exact location of these mGluRs is not clear at present, which may represent a further difference between LPP- and MPP-GC synapses, and with important behavioural and physiological consequences.</p>
<p>Both, t-LTD and t-LTP require postsynaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup> at neocortical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bender et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Nevian and Sakmann, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Rodríguez-Moreno et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Martínez-Gallego et al., 2022a</xref>) and hippocampal synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Andrade-Talavera et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Falcón-Moya et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Mateos-Aparicio and Rodríguez-Moreno, 2020</xref>; Ingebert et al., 2021). Moreover, like other forms of t-LTD, that at LPP- and MPP-GC synapses requires a rise in Ca<sup>2+</sup> in the postsynaptic cell due to Ca<sup>2+</sup> release from internal stores, as also seen in other situations of hippocampal, neocortical and cerebellar t-LTD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bender et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Nevian and Sakmann, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Andrade-Talavera et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Sgritta et al., 2017</xref>; Falcón- Moya et al., 2020; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Martínez-Gallego et al., 2022a</xref>). This is similar to the LTD induced by LFS in DG GCs (Wang et al., 1997). Our data also implies an involvement of calcineurin in t-LTD induction at LPP-GC synapses but not at MPP-GC synapses, an additional striking difference between these two types of synapses. Protein phosphatases, including calcineurin, may be required for different forms of LTD, both in the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Mulkey et al., 1994</xref>) and neocortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Torii et al., 1995</xref>). Future experiments will determine the exact mechanism by which calcineurin mediates t-LTD at LPP but not at MPP synapses. What is clear for the moment is that while the requirements for Ca<sup>2+</sup> seem to be similar at both LPP-GC and MPP-GC synapses, the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent protein phosphatase calcineurin is only involved in t-LTD at LPP-GC synapses. Significantly, the functional consequences of this difference remain to be determined. Our results indicate that eCBs and CB<sub>1</sub>Rs are involved in the induction of these two different forms of t-LTD, in agreement with previous field recordings showing that the eCB system is involved in synaptic plasticity at PP-DG synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Wang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Peñasco et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Fontaine et al., 2020</xref>). Here we did not elucidate the location of the CB<sub>1</sub>Rs mediating t-LTD, such that further work will be required to address this question. However, the demonstration that astrocytes are required for t-LTD is suggestive that astrocytic CB<sub>1</sub>Rs might be involved.</p>
<p>Through two different approaches (introducing BAPTA into astrocytes and using mutant dnSNARE mice) we demonstrated the involvement of astrocytes in presynaptic t-LTD, both at LPP- and MPP-GC synapses. Astrocytes participate in synaptic potentiation at PP-GC synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Jourdain et al., 2007</xref>), although little is known about the contribution of astrocytes to LTD. Thus, this is the first demonstration of the participation of astrocytes in LTD at these synapses. Interestingly, and as found in the somatosensory cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Min and Nevian, 2012</xref>), glutamate is required to mediate t-LTD induction at both types of PP-GC synapses, and in fact, t-LTD can be recovered by the local application of glutamate at both LPP- and MPP-GC synapses in slices from dnSNARE mice that do not develop t-LTD otherwise. These findings agree with previous studies showing that astrocytes can release glutamate that reaches the NMDARs located in the presynaptic boutons at PP-GC synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Bezzi et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Jourdain et al., 2007</xref>), influencing synaptic transmission at MPP-GC synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Savtchouk et al., 2019</xref>). It is interesting to note that the presynaptic targets of the glutamate at least in part released by astrocytes are not the same at LPP- and MPP-GC synapses, as they are mGluRs in the case of LPP-GC synapses, and both NMDARs and mGluRs in the case of MPP-GC synapses. While it is possible that glutamate from the presynaptic neuron also activates preNMDARs and mGluRs, the amount of glutamate released by presynaptic terminals may be insufficient to drive t-LTD, and hence, glutamate released from astrocytes may be required for t-LTD.</p>
<p><italic>What is the physiological role of these forms of plasticity?</italic> For the moment, the exact role of STDP in the perforant cortex or in the hippocampus is not known, and more work is necessary to specifically determine functions for t-LTP and t-LTD. STDP seems a good candidate to mediate spatial learning in the hippocampus (Bush et al., 2010) and the possible role of t-LTP and t-LTD in forms of learning involving the hippocampus and the perforant cortex will be addressed in future studies. Our studies were done in developing P13-P21 animals indicating its relevance during maturation. The functions of t-LTP and t-LTD during development are most probably related to the refinement of synaptic connections and remodelling of neuronal circuits (Andrade- Talavera et al., 2023). As a Hebbian learning rule, t-LTP should occur when the spike order is pre-before-post, strengthening those connections in which the presynaptic neuron takes part in firing the postsynaptic cell, as predicted by Hebb, whereas t-LTD occurs when the spike order is reversed, so that non-causal spiking weakens the connections involved, possibly as a first step in the elimination of those connections during development as has been suggested (see Caporale and Dan, 2008). Indeed, further studies will be necessary to determine the true influence of STDP in the perforant cortex and in the hippocampus, and the specific developmental role of t-LTD and t-LTP in these circuits. As discussed previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Pérez-Rodríguez et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Falcón-Moya et al., 2020</xref>), t-LTD most probably participates in refining synapses, potentially weakening excitatory synapses that are underused or behaviorally irrelevant (Buonomano and Merzenich, 1998; Feldman and Brecht, 2005).</p>
<p>It is interesting to note that with these new results it is clear that both forms of t- LTD may require glutamate from astrocytes. Presynaptic plasticity may involve structural changes and may change the short-term properties of neurotransmitter release, participating in circuit computations, and changing the excitatory/inhibitory balance or sensory adaptations (Monday et al., 2018). Why some synapses, like L4-L2/3 synapses at somatosensory cortex (and as observed in the hippocampus at CA3-CA1 synapses), show pre- and/or post-synaptic plasticity requires further study. Interestingly, in the synapses studied here, t-LTD of LPP-GC and MPP-GC synapses have different requirements, indicating that the presynaptic expression of plasticity is fundamental for the correct functioning of brain circuits and it is possible that different presynaptic forms of t-LTD from synapses onto the same neuron as pre- and postsynaptic forms of LTD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Banerjee et al., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">2014</xref>) are regulated differently. Presynaptically expressed forms of t-LTD may in fact control the trial-to-trial reliability, and they may induce a larger change in signal-to-noise ratio than postsynaptic changes alone, as described in auditory cortex (Froemke et al., 2013). Broad-ranging input representations from the EC transmitted via the PP are sparse, and the DG processes this information and converts it into a less well-correlated output to become less similar and more specific (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Borzello et al., 2023</xref>). Whether t-LTD at LPP and MPP synapses described here are involved in this important process require further research and the different cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in t-LTD at LPP- and MPP-GC synapses may account for some of the difference in their physiological influence. Notwithstanding this, the potential behavioural influence of the presynaptic forms of LTD studied here is still an emerging issue of particular interest in the near future.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The study characterized the cellular and molecular mechanisms of spike timing-dependent long-term depression (t-LTD) at the synapses between excitatory afferents from lateral (LPP) and medial (MPP) perforant pathways to granule cells (GC) of the dentate gyrus (DG) in mice.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The electrophysiological experiments are thorough. The experiments are systematically reported and support the conclusions drawn.</p>
<p>
This study extends current knowledge by elucidating additional plasticity mechanisms at PP-GC synapses, complementing existing literature.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>To more conclusively define the pivotal role of astrocytes in modulating t-LTD at MPP and LPP GC synapses through SNARE protein-dependent glutamate release, as posited in this study, the authors could adopt additional methods, such as alternative mouse models designed to regulate SNARE-dependent exocytosis, as well as optogenetic or chemogenetic strategies for precise astrocyte manipulation during t-LTD induction. This would provide more direct evidence of the influence of astrocytic activity on synaptic plasticity.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This work reports the existence of spike timing-dependent long-term depression (t-LTD) of excitatory synaptic strength at two synapses of the dentate gyrus granule cell, which are differently connected to the entorhinal cortex via either the lateral or medial perforant pathways (LPP or MPP, respectively). Using patch-clamp electrophysiological recording of tLTD in combination with either pharmacology or a genetically modified mouse model, they provide information on the differences in the molecular mechanism underlying this t-LTD at the two synapses.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The two synapses analyzed in this study have been understudied. This new data thus provides interesting new information on a plasticity process at these synapses, and the authors demonstrate subtle differences in the underlying molecular mechanisms at play. Experiments are in general well controlled and provide robust data that are properly interpreted.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>- Caution should be taken in the interpretation of the results to extrapolate to adult brain as the data were obtained in P13-21 days old mice, a period during which synapses are still maturing and highly plastic.</p>
<p>
- In experiments where the drug FK506 or thapsigargin are loaded intracellularly, the concentrations used are as high as for extracellular application. Could there be an error of interpretation when stating that the targeted actors are necessarily in the post-synaptic neuron? Is it not possible for the drug to diffuse out of the cell as it is evident that it can enter the cell when applied extracellularly?</p>
<p>
- The experiments implicating glutamate release from astrocytes in t-LTD would require additional controls to better support the conclusions made by the authors. As the data stand, it is not clear how the authors identified astrocytes to load BAPTA and if dnSNARE expression in astrocytes does not indirectly perturb glutamate release in neurons.</p>
<p>Significance:</p>
<p>While this is the first report of t-LTD at these synapses, this plasticity process has been mechanistically well investigated at other synapses in the hippocampus and in the cortex. Nevertheless, this new data suggests that mechanistic differences in the induction of t-LTD at these two DG synapses could contribute to the differences in the physiological influence of the LPP and MPP pathways.</p>

<p>Coatl et al. investigated the mechanisms of synaptic plasticity of two important hippocampal synapses, the excitatory afferents from lateral and medial perforant pathways (LPP and MPP, respectively) of the entorhinal cortex (EC) connecting to granule cells of the hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG). They find that these two different EC-DG synaptic connections in mice show a presynaptically expressed form of long-term depression (LTD) requiring postsynaptic calcium, eCB synthesis, CB1R activation, astrocyte activity, and metabotropic glutamate receptor activation. Interestingly, LTD at MPP-GC synapses requires ionotropic NMDAR activation whereas LTD at LPP-GC synapse is NMDAR independent. Thus, they discovered two novel forms of t-LTD that require astrocytes at EC-GC synapses. Although plasticity of EC-DG granule cell (GC) synapses has been studied using classical protocols, These are the first analysis of the synaptic plasticity induced by spike timing dependent protocols at these synapses. Interestingly, the data also indicate that t-LTD at each type of synapse require different group I mGluRs, with LPP-GC synapses dependent on mGluR5 and MPP-GC t-LTD requiring mGluR1.</p>
<p>The authors performed a detailed analysis of the coefficient of variation of the EPSP slopes, miniature responses and different approaches (failure rate, PPRs, CV, and mEPSP frequency and amplitude analysis) they demonstrate a decrease in the probability of neurotransmitter release and a presynaptic locus for these two forms of LTD at both types of synapses. By using elegant electrophysiological experiments and taking advantage of the conditional dominant-negative (dn) SNARE mice in which doxycycline administration blocks exocytosis and impairs vesicle release by astrocytes, they demonstrate that both LTD forms require the release of gliotransmitters from astrocytes. These data add in an interesting way to the ongoing discussion on whether LTD induced by STDP participates in refining synapses potentially weakening excitatory synapses under the control of different astrocytic networks. The conclusions of this paper are mostly well supported by data, but some aspects the results must be clarified and extended.</p>
<p>(1) It should be clarified whether present results are obtained with or without the functional inhibitory synapse activation. It is not clear if GABAergic synapses are blocked or not. If GABAergic synapses are not blocked authors must discuss whether the LTD of the EPSPs is due to a decrease in glutamatergic receptor activation or an increase in GABAergic receptor activation. Moreover, it should be recommended to analyze not only the EPSPs but also the EPSCs to address whether the decrease in synaptic transmission is caused by a decrease in the input resistance or by a decrease in the space constant (lambda).</p>
<p>
(2) Authors show that Thapsigargin loaded in the postsynaptic neuron prevents the induction of LTD at both synapses. Analyzing the effects of blocking postsynaptic IP3Rs (Heparin in the patch pipette) and Ryanodine receptors (Ruthenium red in the patch pipette) is recommended for a deeper analysis of the mechanism implicated in the induction of this novel forms of LTD in the hippocampus.</p>
<p>
(3) Authors nicely demonstrate that CB1R activation is required in these forms of LTD by blocking CB1Rs with AM251, however an interesting unanswered question is whether CB1R activation is sufficient to induce this synaptic plasticity. This reviewer suggests studying whether applying puffs of the CB1R agonist, WIN 55,212-2, could induce these forms of LTD.</p>
<p>
(4) Finally, adding a last figure with a cartoon summarizing the proposed model of action in these novel forms of LTD would add a positive value and would help the reading of the manuscript, especially in those aspects related with the discussion of the results.</p>
<p>The extension of these results would improve the manuscript which provides interesting results showing two novel forms of presynaptic t-LTD in the brain synapses with different action mechanisms probably implicated in the different aspects of information processing.</p>
