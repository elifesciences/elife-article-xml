<title>Abstract</title><p>Encoding of several sensory modalities into neural signals is mediated by ribbon synapses. The synaptic ribbon tethers synaptic vesicles at the presynaptic active zone (AZ) and may act as a super-scaffold organizing AZ topography. Here we employed a synthetic biology approach to reconstitute structures mimicking ribbon-type AZs in HEK293 cells for probing minimal molecular requirements and studying presynaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel clustering. Co-expressing a membrane-targeted version of the AZ-protein Bassoon and the ribbon core protein RIBEYE, we observed structures recapitulating basic aspects of ribbon-type AZs, which we call <italic>synthetic</italic> ribbons or <italic>SyRibbons</italic>. Super-resolution STED microscopy and cryo-correlative electron tomography revealed <italic>SyRibbons</italic> were similar to native ribbons at AZs of cochlear inner hair cells in shape and size. <italic>SyRibbons</italic> with Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel clusters formed upon additional expression of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels and RIM-binding protein 2 (RBP2). Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel clusters associated with <italic>SyRibbons</italic> were larger than ribbonless Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels clusters and functional analysis by Ca<sup>2+</sup>-imaging in combination with patch clamp showed partial confinement of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal at <italic>SyRibbons</italic>. In summary, we identify Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels, RBP, membrane-anchored Bassoon, and RIBEYE as minimal components for reconstituting a basic ribbon-type AZ. <italic>SyRibbons</italic> might complement animal studies on molecular interactions of AZ proteins.</p>

<title>Significance Statement</title>
<p>Encoding of sensory information in our eyes and ears builds on specialized ribbon synapses of sensory cells. Elucidating the molecular underpinning of their fascinating structure and function is an ongoing effort to which we add a bottom-up reconstitution approach in cultured cells. Aiming to recapitulate basic properties of ribbon-type presynaptic active zones of cochlear inner hair cells, we identified a minimal set of proteins that assemble in cellular nanodomains, structurally and functionally alike active zones. While not yet reconstituting synaptic vesicle exocytosis, we consider the established synthetic ribbon-type active zones a valuable platform for studying molecular interactions of active zone proteins. We expect the approach to complement and reduce experiments on native ribbon synapses asserted from animals.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Synapses of sensory receptor cells of the inner ear and the retina are hallmarked by the presence of an electron-dense structure called the synaptic ribbon, which tethers synaptic vesicles (SVs) at the presynaptic active zone (AZ, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Moser <italic>et al</italic>, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Matthews &amp; Fuchs, 2010</xref>]). Proposed functional rolesof the ribbon include (i) its role as a SV replenishment machine for tireless neurotransmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bunt, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Holt <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Khimich <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Frank <italic>et al</italic>, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Snellman <italic>et al</italic>, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Graydon <italic>et al</italic>, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Vaithianathan <italic>et al</italic>, 2016</xref>), (ii) “super-scaffold” regulating the abundance, topography, and function of AZ players such Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels and release sites and their tight coupling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Khimich <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Frank <italic>et al</italic>, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Wong <italic>et al</italic>, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Maxeiner <italic>et al</italic>, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Jean <italic>et al</italic>, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Grabner &amp; Moser, 2021</xref>), and iii) coordination of SV release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Heidelberger <italic>et al</italic>, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Glowatzki &amp; Fuchs, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Singer <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Edmonds, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Mehta <italic>et al</italic>, 2013</xref>). Yet, our molecular understanding of how these postulated functions are executed by synaptic ribbons is still limited.</p>
<p>Likewise, the clustering of Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels at the AZ, how it is varied among different or even the same synapse types and how the ribbon contributes towards this, remain active areas of research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Wichmann &amp; Kuner, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Moser <italic>et al</italic>, 2023</xref>). For example, ribbon synapses of mature inner hair cells (IHC) assemble Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels at the base of the ribbon, but vary in shape, size and channel complement of the Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 clusters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Frank <italic>et al</italic>, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Wong <italic>et al</italic>, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Neef <italic>et al</italic>, 2018</xref>) partially dependent on the position within the IHC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Ohn <italic>et al</italic>, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Özçete &amp; Moser, 2021</xref>). IHC synapses lacking AZ-anchored ribbons in Bassoon mutant mice showed fewer Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels with altered topography (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Frank <italic>et al</italic>, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Neef <italic>et al</italic>, 2018</xref>). While genetic disruption of Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel-tethering AZ proteins RIM2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Jung <italic>et al</italic>, 2015</xref>) and RBP2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Krinner <italic>et al</italic>, 2017</xref>) reduced the abundance of Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels at IHC synapses, their topography retained the typical stripe-like shape of Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel clusters. Constitutive deletion of RIBEYE, the core scaffold protein of the synaptic ribbon, provided so far the most direct test of the scaffolding role of the ribbon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Maxeiner <italic>et al</italic>, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Jean <italic>et al</italic>, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Becker <italic>et al</italic>, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Grabner &amp; Moser, 2021</xref>). Here, ribbon-less synapses of IHCs showed an altered Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel topography with a more spatially widespread presynaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal but intact Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel complement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Jean <italic>et al</italic>, 2018</xref>). Moreover, the voltage-dependence of activation as well as the inactivation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels appeared to be altered, suggesting a possible role of the synaptic ribbon in regulating Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel physiology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Jean <italic>et al</italic>, 2018</xref>). Changes in Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel physiology upon deletion of RIBEYE were also found for Ca<sub>V</sub>1.4 at ribbon-less rod photoreceptor AZs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Grabner &amp; Moser, 2021</xref>). Finally, IHCs lacking piccolino, a ribbon-synapse specific isoform of the AZ protein piccolo, show AZs with smaller synaptic ribbons and altered clustering, yet normal complement of Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Michanski <italic>et al</italic>, 2023</xref>).</p>
<p>So how does the synaptic ribbon tune into the orchestra of AZ proteins that collectively organize Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel abundance, topography, and function? To what extent can the effects observed upon disruption of Bassoon be attributed to the concomitant loss of the ribbon? These questions seem even more relevant given that, so far to our knowledge, no direct interactions between Bassoon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Frank <italic>et al</italic>, 2010</xref>) or RIBEYE and Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel have been described. Here, we adopted a bottom-up synthetic biology approach to assemble a minimal presynaptic protein machinery required to bring together RIBEYE and Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels in a ‘synapse-naïve’ expression system to assess the role of the synaptic ribbon in regulating Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel clustering and physiology. Similar approaches have previously been employed for reconstituting aspects of conventional synapses, for instance in “hemi-synapses” between co-cultured neurons and non-neuronal cells overexpressing presynaptic or postsynaptic components (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Craig <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>). More recently, Munc13-1 supra-molecular assemblies which recruit release machinery proteins were reconstituted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Sakamoto <italic>et al</italic>, 2018</xref>).</p>
<p>Expression of RIBEYE in synapse-naïve cell lines such as COS-7 cells led to large cytosolic assemblies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Schmitz <italic>et al</italic>, 2000</xref>). Ribbon-like electron dense structures with vesicles have also been reported upon heterologous RIBEYE expression in retinal progenitor cell-line (R28, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Magupalli <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref>]). However, these cells might not be considered synapse-naïve and the presence and function of Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels at synthetic ribbon synapses remained to be studied. The need for co-expressing at least three Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel subunits (Ca<sub>V</sub>α<sub>x</sub>, Ca<sub>V</sub>β<sub>x</sub> and Ca<sub>V</sub>α<sub>2</sub>8<sub>x</sub>) in synapse-naïve cell lines renders acute co-expression of AZ multidomain proteins cumbersome. Here we took advantage of synapse-naïve Human Embryonic Kidney 293 (HEK293) cells stably expressing inducible Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3α<sub>1</sub>, which is the predominant subtype of voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels at IHC ribbon synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Brandt <italic>et al</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Platzer <italic>et al</italic>, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Dou <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>), as well as constitutively expressed Ca<sub>V</sub>β<sub>3</sub> and Ca<sub>V</sub>α<sub>2</sub>8<sub>1</sub>. We co-expressed RIBEYE along with membrane targeted Bassoon and observed structures with striking resemblance to IHC synaptic ribbon-type AZs nicknamed ‘<italic>SyRibbons</italic>’. We characterized the structure and function of these synthetic ribbon-type AZs and identified Bassoon, RBP2, RIBEYE and Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 channels as the minimal components required for assembling a basic ribbon-type AZ. We observed larger Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 channel clusters near <italic>SyRibbons</italic> and with partially localized Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx upon stimulation. Our results support the role of synaptic ribbons in promoting the formation of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 channel micro-clustering. Synthetic ribbon-type AZs offer a novel approach for functionally studying protein-protein interaction and will likely complement, refine and reduce experiments on native ribbon synapses.</p>

<title>Membrane-targeted Bassoon recruits RIBEYE to the cell membrane in HEK293 cells where structures mimicking inner hair cell synaptic ribbons are formed</title>
<p>HEK293 cells have the advantage of not expressing the synaptic machinery components studied here. This provides a clean background for reconstituting synthetic synapses from a minimal set of synaptic proteins. Our first step towards assembling a ribbon-type AZ in a heterologous expression system was to express RIBEYE, the core scaffold protein of the synaptic ribbon, and target it to the cell membrane. We performed transient transfection of a RIBEYE construct with a C-terminal EGFP tag in HEK293 cells and observed large spherical clusters of RIBEYE that appeared largely cytosolic (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1Aii</xref>), in contrast to a diffuse cytosolic distribution when merely expressing EGFP (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1Ai</xref>). These RIBEYE clusters form due to self-assembling properties of RIBEYE via multiple sites of homophilic interaction as have been demonstrated before in several cell lines. They do not colocalize with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), Golgi apparatus, or lysosomes and hence, are unlikely to reflect RIBEYE entrapped in protein trafficking pathways or to represent degradation products of overexpressed RIBEYE (Supplementary Fig. 1A, B and C).</p>

<p>Next, for membrane targeting of these cytosolic RIBEYE clusters, we co-expressed the multidomain cytomatrix of the active zone protein Bassoon (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1Aiii</xref>). Prior work on the molecular underpinnings of ribbon synapses had identified Bassoon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">tom Dieck <italic>et al</italic>, 1998</xref>) to critically contribute to anchoring the synaptic ribbon to the AZ membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Khimich <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Dick <italic>et al</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">tom Dieck <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>). Co-expression of full-length Bassoon along with RIBEYE in HEK293 cells showed colocalizing clusters of the two proteins that, however, remained largely cytosolic (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1Aiv</xref>).</p>
<p>Next, for plasma membrane-targeting of Bassoon, we generated a construct by removing the first 95 N-terminal amino acids of Bassoon and replacing these with a palmitoylation consensus sequence of the neuronal Growth Associated Protein 43 (GAP43). We refer to this as ‘palm-Bassoon’ throughout, and we used constructs with and without a C-terminal EGFP tag (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>). Expression of either of these palm-Bassoon constructs in HEK293 cells showed comparable immunofluorescence patterns with Bassoon puncta spread across the periphery of the cell, largely colocalizing with the endogenously expressed plasma membrane-standing Na, K-ATPase α<sub>1</sub> (data representative of 3 transfections, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C, D</xref>). Palm-Bassoon does not appear to localize in the ER, Golgi apparatus or lysosomes (Supplementary Fig. 1D, E and F). Comparing the ratio of Bassoon signal intensity at the periphery <italic>versus</italic> inside of the cell in randomly selected single sections from confocal stacks of palm-Bassoon and Bassoon transfected cells (N = 10 cells, 3 transfections per group, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>) demonstrated a higher Bassoon signal intensity at the periphery of cells expressing the palm-Bassoon construct (<italic>****P</italic> &lt; 0.0001, Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon test), implying successful plasma membrane targeting of Bassoon.</p>
<p>Next, we co-expressed palm-Bassoon and RIBEYE in HEK293 cells and observed colocalizing RIBEYE and Bassoon immunofluorescent puncta at the periphery of cells (7 transfections; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2Ai</xref>). Closer inspection of these immunofluorescent puncta with STimulated Emission Depletion (STED) nanoscopy (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2Aii</xref>) revealed discrete structures typically consisting of ellipsoidal RIBEYE clusters juxtaposing on top of plate-like palm-Bassoon structures which seemingly anchor the RIBEYE clusters to the plasma membrane. We found the morphology of the RIBEYE + palm-Bassoon structures to be strikingly reminiscent of the arrangement of the two proteins in IHC ribbon synapses, where an ellipsoid/spherical synaptic ribbon composed of RIBEYE is found seated on a Bassoon plate that anchors it to the presynaptic AZ membrane (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Wong <italic>et al</italic>, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Michanski <italic>et al</italic>, 2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">2023</xref>) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B, i</xref> and ii; data from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Michanski <italic>et al</italic>, 2023</xref>).</p>

<p>We compared the RIBEYE and Bassoon signal intensities at the periphery <italic>versus</italic> inside of the cell in randomly selected single sections from confocal stacks of HEK cells expressing RIBEYE and palm-Bassoon (N = 9 cells) and HEK cells expressing RIBEYE and full-length Bassoon (N=9 cells). We found an increased peripheral distribution of both RIBEYE and Bassoon when using palm-Bassoon (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>, <italic>****P</italic> &lt; 0.0001, Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon test), implying successful membrane targeting of RIBEYE by palm-Bassoon. In each transfection, ∼10% cells showed co-expression of both RIBEYE and palm-Bassoon (for representative sample overview see Supplementary Fig. 2). Of those, cells expressing discrete RIBEYE-palm Bassoon structures were discernible by the characteristic RIBEYE distribution along the periphery of the cell. This peripheral distribution in turn seemingly depends upon RIBEYE and palm-Bassoon expression ratios (shown in Supplementary Fig. 2B) as cells with little to no palm-Bassoon expression show predominantly cytosolic RIBEYE puncta and were not used for analysis. For simplicity, we henceforth refer to the structures composed of RIBEYE and palm-Bassoon in HEK293 cells as <italic>SyRibbons</italic> (for <italic>synthetic</italic> ribbons).</p>
<p>We next performed three-dimensional surface renderings using <italic>Imaris</italic> 9.6 (Oxford Instruments) to assess these structures. In a given cell, only structures with colocalizing RIBEYE and palm-Bassoon immunofluorescence were considered for analysis to exclude occasional non-membrane localized spots (on average 51.75 ± 40.84 RIBEYE surfaces colocalizing with Bassoon surfaces per cell; N = 20 cells). The volumes of RIBEYE and palm-Bassoon surfaces of <italic>SyRibbons</italic> were smaller on average and more variable (average volume ± standard deviation (SD) = 0.19 ± 0.23 µm<sup>3</sup> with a coefficient of variation (CV) = 1.23 for RIBEYE; n<sub>spots</sub> = 864 and volume = 0.17 ± 0.18 µm<sup>3</sup> with CV = 1.10 for Bassoon; n<sub>spots</sub> = 951; data from N = 20 cells, quantifications from 5 sample transfections) than volumes of synaptic ribbons and Bassoon immunofluorescent puncta from rat IHCs (volume = 0.29 ± 0.17 µm<sup>3</sup>, CV = 0.59 for RIBEYE; n<sub>spots</sub> = 290, and volume = 0.27 ± 0.18 µm<sup>3</sup>, CV = 0.67 for Bassoon; n<sub>spots</sub> = 314, data from N = 29 cells), (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D, E</xref>). Moreover, volumes of RIBEYE surfaces show a high positive correlation to volumes of corresponding palm-Bassoon surfaces (<italic>P<sub>r</sub></italic> = 0.778, <italic>****P</italic> &lt; 0.0001), implying that larger palm-Bassoon structures may recruit bigger RIBEYE structures to the plasma membrane. We also note that the volume of RIBEYE surfaces in <italic>SyRibbons</italic> appears smaller and well-regulated in contrast to the predominantly large, cytosolic RIBEYE assemblies in cells co-expressing RIBEYE and full-length Bassoon (volume = 0.30 ± 0.36 µm<sup>3</sup>, n<sub>spots</sub> = 460, N = 10 cells, <italic>****P</italic> &lt; 0.001, Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon Test). In turn, Bassoon clusters seemed regulated by co-expressed RIBEYE: Bassoon surfaces at the plasma membrane were larger at <italic>SyRibbons</italic> than in the absence of RIBEYE in cells only expressing palm-Bassoon (volume = 0.14 ± 0.21 µm<sup>3</sup>, n<sub>spots</sub> = 2217, N = 13 cells, <italic>****P</italic> &lt; 0.001, Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon Test). RIBEYE clusters constituting <italic>SyRibbons</italic> appeared more spherical than the plate-like Bassoon structures in the same cells (sphericity Ψ = 0.91 ± 0.05, n<sub>spots</sub> = 864 for RIBEYE versus Ψ = 0.86 ± 0.07, n<sub>spots</sub>= 951 for Bassoon, data from N = 20 cells; <italic>****P</italic> &lt; 0.0001, Kruskal-Wallis test with <italic>post hoc</italic> Dunn’s multiple comparison test). This follows the same trend as in rat IHCs where RIBEYE spots indeed appear more spherical (Ψ = 0.90 ± 0.05, n<sub>spots</sub> = 290) compared to Bassoon spots (Ψ = 0.76 ± 0.10, n<sub>spots</sub> = 314); <italic>****P</italic> &lt; 0.0001, Kruskal-Wallis test with <italic>post hoc</italic> Dunn’s multiple comparison test, data from N = 29 cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2F</xref>). Nonetheless, the fact that next to structures with volumes comparable to IHC ribbons, we also encountered smaller and larger structures, likely reflects poorer regulation of RIBEYE and palm-Bassoon expression in the heterologous system.</p>
<p>Next, we analyzed <italic>SyRibbons</italic> in situ using cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET), which capitalizes on cell vitrification to obtain near-native preservation. Plunge-frozen HEK cells transfected with RIBEYE-GFP and untagged palm-Bassoon were vitrified and subsequently milled using a cryo-focused ion beam (cryo-FIB; Supplementary Fig. 3A) to produce 150 nm-thick lamellae as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Rigort <italic>et al</italic>, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Pierson <italic>et al</italic>, 2024</xref>, see methods). Using a light microscope integrated in the cryo-FIB chamber, we targeted cell areas showing peripheral GFP fluorescence corresponding to <italic>SyRibbons</italic> (Supplementary Fig. 3B). Lamellae were subsequently transferred to a cryo-transmission electron microscope, and tomographic tilt-series were acquired at fluorescence locations. The tomograms showed that GFP-positive RIBEYE spots corresponded to electron-dense structures (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3A-B</xref>), as is characteristic of the synaptic ribbon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Robertis &amp; Franchi, 1956</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Smith &amp; Sjöstrand, 1961</xref>). These electron-dense <italic>SyRibbons</italic> appeared to be approx. 300 – 800 nm in size and were ovoid or ellipsoidal in shape (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3B-C</xref>, Supplementary Fig. 3C). Some <italic>SyRibbons</italic> displayed a hollow core (Supplementary Fig. 3Ci and 3C<sub>iii</sub>) and on closer inspection, some appeared to have a multi-lamellar ultrastructure (Supplementary Fig. 3Cii), both of which have been reported previously for natively expressed synaptic ribbons in the inner ear and the retina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Michanski <italic>et al</italic>, 2023</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Sobkowicz <italic>et al</italic>, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Liberman, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Stamataki <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Wichmann &amp; Moser, 2015</xref>). We captured a <italic>SyRibbon</italic> positioned within 100 nm from the plasma membrane (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3C</xref>). Although bona fide ribbons display a halo of SVs tethered on their surface, we did not observe any obvious accumulation of vesicular structures around these <italic>SyRibbons</italic>, which is not unexpected for synapse-naïve HEK cells. This is in contrast to a previous report in R28 retinal progenitor cells, where heterologously expressed RIBEYE was shown to recruit vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Magupalli <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref>). Intriguingly, in some tomograms, we observed membrane-bound <italic>SyRibbons</italic> (Supplementary Fig. 3Ci<sub>-iv</sub>), which may indicate an autophagic engulfment of some of these overexpressed structures.</p>

After 18-24 hours, the cell culture media was changed, and cells were recorded 24-36 hours afterwards. We used 10 mM [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>e</sub> and recorded Ca<sup>2+</sup> current (density) - voltage relations (IVs) ∼1 minute after establishing the whole-cell configuration by applying step depolarizations of 20 ms from −86.2 mV to 58.8 mV in 5 mV increments.

Line profiles drawn tangentially along the plasma membrane showed that beyond the general distribution of a Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3α<sub>1</sub> signal in the plasma membrane, Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3α<sub>1</sub> signal hotspots occurred underneath the <italic>SyRibbons</italic> (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C</xref>). The signal intensity of RIBEYE immunofluorescence positively correlated with the Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 signal immunofluorescence, (<italic>P<sub>r</sub></italic> = 0.839 and 0.886 from two sample line scans, <italic>****P</italic> &lt; 0.0001), which has previously been reported for immunolabeled native ribbon-type AZs of mouse IHCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Ohn <italic>et al</italic>, 2016</xref>). We further performed a pixel-based correlation analysis (Supplementary Fig. 7A, B) which indicated a moderate to strong colocalisation of RIBEYE and Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 upon co-expression of palm-Bassoon and RBP2. In contrast, a poor colocalization was found in cells expressing only RIBEYE and Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3; average Pearson’s colocalisation coefficient = 0.41 versus 0.24; average Mander’s overlap coefficient = 0.63 versus 0.34, N = 12 and 8 cells respectively (<italic>**P</italic> &lt; 0.01m Wilcoxon’s Rank Test).

<title>Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging reveals a partial spatial confinement of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal at synthetic ribbon-type active zones</title>
<p>Finally, we set-out to functionally characterize synthetic ribbon-type AZs. We combined patch-clamp recordings of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx with spinning-disk confocal microscopy to visualize Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals at the synthetic ribbon-type AZs in HEK293 cells. Following tetracycline-induction for Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 expression, HEK293 cells were co-transfected with constructs expressing RIBEYE-GFP, untagged palm-Bassoon and RBP2-p2A-mKATE2, (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7A</xref>). We recorded mKATE2 positive cells that expressed peripheral GFP puncta, indicative of RIBEYE and palm-Bassoon co-expression. We employed peripheral GFP expression as a proxy of <italic>SyRibbons</italic> for functional analysis (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7B</xref>). Ruptured patch-clamp recordings were performed with 10 mM [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>e</sub> and 10 mM intracellular EGTA to enhance the signal to background ratio for visualizing Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx using the low-affinity red-shifted Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator Calbryte590 (100 µM, k<sub>d</sub> = 1.4 µM). After loading the cell for approximately a minute, we first applied step depolarizations of 20 ms from −83 to +62 mV in 5-mV step increments to measure Ca<sup>2+</sup> current (density)–voltage relations. We did not observe any changes in either the Ca<sup>2+</sup> current density (<italic>P</italic> = 0.293, t-test) or the voltage-dependence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> current (<italic>P</italic> = 0.780, t-test when comparing V<sub>half</sub>) when comparing cells expressing Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 + RBP2 + <italic>SyRibbons</italic> with cells expressing only CaV1.3 (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7C</xref> and <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7D</xref>). Next, we applied a depolarizing pulse to +2 mV for 500 ms and acquired images at a frame rate of 20 Hz (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7E</xref>). The intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals mediated by Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx were visualized as an increase in Calbryte590 fluorescence. The increase of Calbryte590 fluorescence appeared to spread throughout the HEK293 cell membrane with discrete regions of higher signal intensity at <italic>SyRibbons</italic> (exemplary cell shown in <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7F</xref> with zoom-in at site with <italic>SyRibbon</italic> shown in 7G). We note that we did not find noticeable red fluorescence at <italic>SyRibbons</italic> in the absence of depolarization, which is similar to findings with Fluo-4FF in IHCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Frank <italic>et al</italic>, 2009</xref>), but different from the situation for the large spherical presynaptic bodies in bullfrog hair cells that are stained by Fluo-3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Issa &amp; Hudspeth, 1996</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we reconstituted and characterized a minimal ribbon-type AZ model system using heterologous expression. Co-expressing Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels with membrane targeted Bassoon for RIBEYE anchorage to the plasma membrane and attracting exogenous RBP2 for clustering Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels in HEK293 cells led to structures recapitulating basic aspects of IHC ribbon synapses. Despite the poor regulation of transgene expression in the synapse-naïve HEK293 cells, the AZ-like structures, in the subset of cells were similar in morphology to the native IHC AZs. This applied to the <italic>synthetic</italic> ribbons as well as to the AZ-like clusters of Bassoon, RBP2 and Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels. However, all three components exhibited variability beyond the substantial natural heterogeneity found among the IHC AZs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Moser <italic>et al</italic>, 2023</xref>). Although expression of RIBEYE does not seem to affect Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 physiology and kinetics, we demonstrate enhanced clustering of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 channels and localization of Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx at <italic>SyRibbons</italic>, with a mild increase in Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal intensity. As <italic>SyRibbons</italic> partially resemble native hair cell AZs, we expect this easily available and experimentally accessible system to serve as an advanced testbed for functional interactions of AZ proteins and Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels. Further efforts towards reconstituting SVs and their release sites will help to enhance the utility of these synthetic AZs.</p>

<title>Synthetic active zone reconstitution model to study ribbon synapse assembly</title>
<p>By demonstrating that membrane-targeted Bassoon suffices to anchor ribbon-like RIBEYE assemblies, this work adds to the top-down and bottom-up evidence for a key role of Bassoon in attracting RIBEYE to the presynaptic density at the AZ in photoreceptors and hair cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Dick <italic>et al</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Khimich <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Jing <italic>et al</italic>, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">tom Dieck <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>). Additional expression of multi-domain proteins of the presynaptic density such as CAST (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Ohtsuka <italic>et al</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Inoue <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>) might avoid the need for artificial palmitoylation of Bassoon for membrane targeting. Furthermore, our results support a model of a bidirectional control of AZ size and shape by RIBEYE and proteins of the presynaptic density. The amount of RIBEYE assembled in membrane localized <italic>SyRibbons</italic> appeared regulated strongly contrasting the seemingly unregulated cytosolic RIBEYE assemblies dominating HEK293 cells in the absence of membrane-targeted Bassoon. Vice versa, clusters of Bassoon at the plasma membrane were larger at <italic>SyRibbons</italic> than in the absence of RIBEYE. Finally, the size of <italic>SyRibbons</italic> seemingly scaled with the size of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 and Bassoon clusters similar to what is observed in IHCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Ohn <italic>et al</italic>, 2016</xref>). Such a model is consistent with results from genetic perturbation of native ribbon synapses: i) disruption of RIBEYE leads to a disintegration of Bassoon into smaller subclusters in IHCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Jean <italic>et al</italic>, 2018</xref>), and ii) disruption of CAST and ELKS reduces the size of the ribbon-type AZs in rod photoreceptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">tom Dieck <italic>et al</italic>, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Hagiwara <italic>et al</italic>, 2018</xref>). We speculate that achieving the full extent of large ribbon-type AZs such as in rod photoreceptors as well as regulating the size of ribbon-type AZs at a specific synapse according to the precise functional demands requires such a functional interplay between proteins of the presynaptic density and RIBEYE. We note that other ribbon-resident proteins such as piccolino likely contribute to this fine-tuning of the size and shape of ribbon-type AZs, which will be an exciting question for future studies. Indeed, disruption of piccolino in IHCs reduced the average ribbon size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Müller <italic>et al</italic>, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Michanski <italic>et al</italic>, 2023</xref>). One exciting example of ribbon synapse heterogeneity manifests itself in IHCs where synapses show a spatial size gradient that likely relates to the diverse molecular and functional properties of the postsynaptic SGNs (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Moser <italic>et al</italic>, 2023</xref>).</p>

<title>Insights into presynaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel clustering and function</title>
<p>Current discussion of the clustering of Ca<sub>V</sub> Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels offers two different models: low affinity protein-protein interactions (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Hibino <italic>et al</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Kaeser <italic>et al</italic>, 2011</xref>) via specific domains and liquid-liquid phase separation involving intrinsically disordered domains (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Heck <italic>et al</italic>, 2019</xref>). Work on ribbon synapses has considered layers of organizing Ca<sub>V</sub> Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels at the AZ that seem more compatible with the former model: i) “micro-clustering” to which the synaptic ribbon contributes as a super-scaffold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Jean <italic>et al</italic>, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Neef <italic>et al</italic>, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Frank <italic>et al</italic>, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Maxeiner <italic>et al</italic>, 2016</xref>) and ii) tethering and “nano-clustering” by RBPs, RIMs, CAST and ELKS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Liu <italic>et al</italic>, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Grabner <italic>et al</italic>, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Jung <italic>et al</italic>, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Krinner <italic>et al</italic>, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Luo <italic>et al</italic>, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Hagiwara <italic>et al</italic>, 2018</xref>). Moreover, there is converging evidence for nanoscale coupling of few Ca<sub>V</sub> Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels to SV release sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Brandt, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Jarsky <italic>et al</italic>, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Wong <italic>et al</italic>, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Maxeiner <italic>et al</italic>, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Özçete &amp; Moser, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Grabner &amp; Moser, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Jaime Tobón &amp; Moser, 2023</xref>) for which a role of the ribbon has been more controversial (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Maxeiner <italic>et al</italic>, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Grabner &amp; Moser, 2021</xref>). MINFLUX nanoscopy of rod photoreceptor AZs recently revealed a well-ordered double-line array topography of Ca<sub>V</sub> Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels, RIM, Bassoon and ubMunc13-2 at the presynaptic membrane on both sides of the ribbon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Grabner <italic>et al</italic>, 2022</xref>).</p>
<p>Clearly, we could not fully reconstitute this complex organization with the minimal set of molecular players at <italic>SyRibbons</italic> in HEK293 cells. Yet, we demonstrate a positive effect of <italic>SyRibbons</italic> on local Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling, recapitulating microclustering of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels at IHC ribbon synapses. However, we note that the functional impact of ribbon-mediated clustering of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels remains unclear at the moment. Our Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging data seems more reminiscent of previous work on ribbon-type AZs of immature IHCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Wong <italic>et al</italic>, 2014</xref>) where a broader distribution of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 and ribbons go along with an immature state of the IHC AZs. We also note that the difference in Ca<sup>2+</sup> signalling near or apart <italic>SyRibbons</italic> is rather subtle. We propose two explanations in this regard: (i) the use of an overexpression system diminishes the contrast of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal between AZ-like domains and the regular membrane. Overexpressed Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 is likely distributed diffusely across the plasma membrane in these cells along with more localised Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 clusters observed at <italic>SyRibbons</italic> (see <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref> lower panel). (ii) While the presence of <italic>SyRibbons</italic> appears to promote the formation of larger Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 channels and partially localise the Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal, it is unlikely that <italic>SyRibbons</italic> recruit a larger Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel complement. IHCs of RIBEYE KO mice were reported to show normal Ca<sup>2+</sup> current amplitudes at the whole-cell and single-AZ level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Jean <italic>et al</italic>, 2018</xref>), while the spatial spread of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal was more diffuse in the absence of the ribbon.</p>
<p>We propose that <italic>SyRibbons</italic> scaffold Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 channel nano-clusters in a non-native heterologous expression system resulting in an increased channel density in regions with <italic>SyRibbons</italic>. In support of this hypothesis, the Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal averaged at <italic>SyRibbons</italic> showed a mildly increased maximal amplitude when compared with diffuse Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel distribution in the absence of <italic>SyRibbons.</italic> Instead, the total number of channels may be unaffected, which would explain why Ca<sup>2+</sup> current amplitudes at the whole-cell level are not impacted by expression of <italic>SyRibbons</italic>. A clear limitation in the study therefore arises from the use of an overexpression system, making it necessary to interpret results with caution and requiring <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>ex vivo</italic> validation. Future use of polycistronic gene expression or stable cell lines expressing all components could help with more consistent expression of the components and make the system become even more widely applicable.</p>
<p>Another limitation of the synthetic AZ system in HEK293 cells is the lack of SVs and the molecular machinery required for SV release. Nonetheless, our work paves the way for future studies including stable co-expression of AZ proteins including of the release site marker Munc13-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Sakamoto <italic>et al</italic>, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Böhme <italic>et al</italic>, 2016</xref>) and potential delivery of SV machinery via co-expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Park <italic>et al</italic>, 2021</xref>). Alternatively, using neurosecretory cells such as pheochromocytoma cells (PC12) or adrenal chromaffin cells in primary culture, offer the advantage of providing synaptic-like microvesicles and a large set of components of the presynaptic machinery such that expression of exogenous proteins might be limited to RIBEYE. On the other hand, the complex molecular background involving various types of Ca<sub>V</sub> channels will likely complicate the interpretation. Regardless, <italic>SyRibbons</italic> in cultured cells offer great availability and as adherent cells, are well accessible to sophisticated analysis by techniques such MINFLUX nanoscopy and cryo-electron tomography.</p>

<title>HEK cell culture and transfections</title>
<p>In this study, we used human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells stably expressing a tetracycline-inducible human Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 pore forming α1-D subunit transgene (CACNA1D, NM_000720.2), and showing constitutive expression of Ca<sub>V</sub>β3 (CACNB3, NM_000725.2) and Ca<sub>V</sub>α<sub>2</sub>8-1 (CACNA2D1, NM_000722.2). The stably expressing cell line was acquired from Charles River Laboratories, Cleveland, Ohio, USA (Cat. No. CT6232). The cells were cultured as per product protocols in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) containing GlutaMax, high glucose and pyruvate (Gibco, Life Tech., 31966047), supplemented with 10% Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS; Gibco, Life Tech., A5256701) and 100 units/ml of Penicillin-Streptomycin (Gibco, Life Tech., 15070063). Additionally, the media was supplemented with 0.6 µM of Isradipine (Sigma Aldrich, I6658) and the following selection antibiotics (in mg/ml): 0.005 Blasticidin (Invivogen, ant-bl-05), 0.50 Geneticin (G418 Sulfate; Gibco, Life Tech., 10131027), 0.10 Zeocin (InvivoGen, ant-zn-05) and 0.04 Hygromycin (Thermo Fisher, 10687010). Cells were cultured in a humidified incubator at 37°C with 5% (v/v) CO<sub>2</sub> saturation. Cells were split at ∼70% confluency every 3-4 days to prevent adverse effects on cell growth and channel expression, by dissociating the cell using Accutase (Sigma-Aldrich, A6964). The passage number did not exceed more than 26 passages. For experiments, cells were grown in media lacking selection antibiotics. For induction of α<sub>1</sub>-D subunit expression, cells were treated with selection antibiotic-free medium containing 3 µg/ml tetracycline. For transfection, 6.8 µg polyethylenimine (PEI, 25kDa linear, Polysciences, 23966) was added along with a total of 2 µg of DNA to a final volume of 100 µl of DMEM (without FBS). The PEI/DNA mixture was thoroughly mixed and allowed to incubate for 30 min at room temperature before being added to the cells (30 µl/well in a 24-well-plate containing 500 µl media, cell confluency ∼50-70%). For all experiments with co-transfections, we used an equimolar ratio of DNA (total amount of DNA was kept 2 µg in a 100 µl transfection mix). After 18-24 hours, transfection media was replaced with fresh media devoid of selection antibiotics. Cells were used for experiments (immunocytochemistry, patch clamp and Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging) 24-48 hours after changing the media or as specified. If cell confluency was too high, cells were reseeded to an appropriate confluency and allowed to settle for at least 12 hours before commencement of experiments.</p>

<title>Expression vectors for RIBEYE, Bassoon, Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 and RBP2</title>
<p>The RIBEYE-GFP construct used consisted of a human RIBEYE cDNA cloned inframe into a pAAV-GFP vector driven by a hybrid CMV-enhancer-human-beta-actin promoter (CMV-HBA) and containing a downstream Woodchuck Hepatitis Virus (WHV) Posttranscriptional Regulatory Element (WPRE) for mRNA stabilization. All Bassoon constructs encode rat Bassoon. The untagged full-length constructs were cloned in the pCS2+ vector. For the generation of palm-Bassoon constructs, we used a pEGFP-C1 vector backbone with a CMV promoter and kanamycin resistance cassette. The insert comprised of a palmitoylation consensus sequence of GAP43 (ATGCTGTGCTGTATGAGAAGAACCAAACAGGTTGAAAAGAATGATGAGGACCAAAAGATTTCCGGACTCAGATCTCGAG), followed by a cDNA sequence encoding amino acids 95-3938 of rat Bassoon, and a C-terminal monomeric GFP. For the untagged version, the GFP tag was replaced by a STOP codon. To generate the Halo-Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 plasmid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Schwenzer <italic>et al</italic>, 2024</xref>), human Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 cDNA (accession number NM_001128840.2) was de-novo synthesized and assembled into a HaloTag vector (Promega G7721) using restriction cloning, thus encoding an N-terminal fusion of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 to HaloTag linked by a ‘GGS’ sequence. The analogous GFP-Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 plasmid was generated by exchanging the HaloTag sequence for mEGFP using restriction cloning. The RBP2 construct with an mKATE2 tag comprised of an insert coding for mouse RBP2 (accession ID NP_001074857.1) with a p2A cleavage site followed by a C-terminal mKATE2 cloned inframe into a f(syn)w-mKATE2-p2A vector driven by a CMV promoter-enhancer and containing downstream WPRE sequence. The untagged version was made by cloning the RBP2 cDNA from this plasmid and replacing RIBEYE-GFP in the pAAV-CMV-HBA-RIBEYE-GFP-WPRE plasmid by in-fusion cloning (Takara Bio USA, Inc.).</p>

<p>HEK293 cells plated on poly-L-lysine coated coverslips were fixed with 99% chilled methanol at −20°C for 2 minutes as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Picher <italic>et al</italic>, 2017b</xref>). The coverslips were washed thoroughly three times with PBS at room temperature (5 – 10 min). Blocking and permeabilization was performed with GSDB (goat serum dilution buffer: 16% normal goat serum, 450 mM NaCl, 0.3% Triton X-100, 20mM phosphate buffer, pH ∼7.4) for 45-60 minutes at room temperature. Samples were incubated with respective primary antibodies (diluted in GSDB, refer to <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>) overnight at 4°C or for 2 hours at RT. The samples were then washed three times (5–10 minutes each) with wash buffer (450 mM NaCl, 0.3% Triton X-100, 20mM phosphate buffer, pH ∼ 7.4). Incubation with appropriate secondary antibodies (also diluted in GSDB refer to <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>) was performed for 1 hour at room temperature in a light-protected wet chamber. Lastly, the coverslips were washed three times with wash buffer (5-10 minutes each) and one final time with PBS, before mounting onto glass slides with a drop of fluorescence mounting medium (Mowiol 4-88, Carl Roth). For live cell imaging of cells transfected with Halo-Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B, C</xref>), cells plated on glass-bottomed dishes were treated with Janelia Fluor 646 HaloTag Ligand (Promega, Cat.

Cells were incubated with the ligand for ∼60 min at 37°C with 5% (v/v) CO<sub>2</sub> saturation, after which the media was replaced with an equal volume of fresh warm culture media.</p>

<p>Images from fixed and live samples were acquired in confocal/ STED mode using an Olympus IX83 inverted microscope combined with an Abberior Instruments Expert Line STED microscope (Abberior Instruments GmbH). We used lasers at 488, 561, and 633 nm for excitation and a 775 nm (1.2W) laser for stimulated emission depletion. 1.4 NA 100X or 20X oil immersion objectives were used for fixed samples, and a water immersion 60X objective was used for live samples. Confocal stacks or single sections were acquired using <italic>Imspector</italic> Software (pixel size = 80 X 80 nm along xy, 200 nm along z). For 2D-STED images, a pixel size of 15 X 15 nm (in xy) was used. Images in Supplementary Fig. 2A were acquired using a Leica SP8 confocal microscope (Leica Microsystems, Germany). All acquired images were visualized using NIH ImageJ software and adjusted for brightness and contrast. Samples and their corresponding controls were processed in parallel using identical staining protocols, laser excitation powers and microscope settings.</p>

<title>Ultrastructural analysis using cryo-correlative electron-light microscopy</title>
<p>HEK293 cells were transfected with RIBEYE-GFP and untagged palm-Bassoon constructs as described above. The next day, the cells were detached using Accutase (Sigma-Aldrich, A6964) and replated on electron microscopy grids (R2/2, Au 200 mesh, 100 holey SiO<sub>2</sub> film; Quantifoil) at a density of 20,000 cells/grid. After 24 hours, grids were vitrified by plunge-freezing in liquid ethane/propane using a house-made manual plunger. Cryo-focused ion beam milling and cryo-correlative light and electron microscopy were performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Rigort <italic>et al</italic>, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Pierson <italic>et al</italic>, 2024</xref>). In brief, upon transferring into an Aquilos 2 focused-ion beam/scanning electron microscope (ThermoFisher Scientific), the samples were imaged with an integrated fluorescent light microscope (ThermoFischer Scientific) at 470 nm excitation wavelength to locate cells expressing peripheral GFP, which corresponded to membrane-localised <italic>SyRibbons</italic>. Milling was performed at a 9° angle at these areas, using ion currents between 500 nA and 100 nA. During milling, the GFP fluorescence was monitored additionally when the lamellae reached 2 µm and 150 nm thickness to ensure that the structures of interest were captured. All fluorescent data is shown as maximum intensity projections of 4 µm z-stacks. For visualization purposes, the fluorescent image shown in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref> was corrected using the rolling ball background subtraction algorithm implemented in Fiji (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Schindelin <italic>et al</italic>, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Sternberg, 1983</xref>). After milling, lamellae were transferred into a Krios G4 cryo-transmission electron microscope (cryo-TEM; ThermoFisher Scientific). Correlation of fluorescence on 150 nm lamellae and 8700x TEM overview revealed electron-dense structures at GFP puncta. Tilt series of these densities were collected at 33k magnification using a dose-symmetric scheme (from −45° to +63°, 9° pretilt, 3° increments) and with a 20 eV energy filter. The total electron dose was 120 e<sup>-</sup>/Å<sup>2</sup>. The data was acquired using SerialEM (Mastronarde, 2005) running PACEtomo script (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Eisenstein <italic>et al</italic>, 2023</xref>). Data pre-processing and tomogram reconstruction from tilt series were done automatically using an in-house script implementing MotionCor2, CTFFIND4 and IMOD (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/rubenlab/snartomo">https://github.com/rubenlab/snartomo</ext-link>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Zheng <italic>et al</italic>, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Rohou &amp; Grigorieff, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Mastronarde, 1997</xref>).

<title>Patch clamp and calcium imaging</title>
<p>Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 stably expressing HEK293 cells were plated on coverslips till about 40-50% confluency was achieved, following which they were induced for Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3α1-D expression by incubating them for 24-48 hours in induction media supplemented with tetracycline. For transfected cells, transfection was performed after 24hrs of induction in the induction media as explained above. Cells were recorded in extracellular solution containing (in mM): 150 choline-Cl, 10 HEPES, 1 MgCl<sub>2</sub> and 10 CaCl<sub>2</sub>; pH was adjusted to 7.3 with CsOH and osmolality was 300-310 mOsm/kg. For electrophysiological recordings in Supplementary Fig. 5 and 6, pipette solution contained (in mM): 140 NMDG, 10 NaCl, 10 HEPES, 5 EGTA, 3 Mg-ATP and 1 MgCl<sub>2</sub>. pH was adjusted to 7.3 with methanesulfonic acid and osmolality was around 290 mOsm/kg. For Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging in <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>, the pipette solution contained (in mM): 111 Cs-glutamate, 1 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 EGTA, 13 TEA-Cl, 20 HEPES, 4 Mg-ATP, 0.3 Na-GTP, 1 L-glutathione, 0.1 Calbryte590 (AAT Bioquest, Cat. No. 20706); pH was adjusted to 7.3, osmolality to 290 mOsm/kg. Resistance of patch pipettes was 3–7 MΩ. HEK293 cells were rupture patch clamped with EPC-10 amplifier (HEKA electronics, Germany) controlled by <italic>Patchmaster</italic> software at room temperature, as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Picher <italic>et al</italic>, 2017b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">2017a</xref>). Cells were kept at a holding potential of −91.2 or −88 mV. All voltages were corrected for liquid junction potential offline (21.2 mV or 18 mV). Currents were leak corrected using a p/10 protocol. Recordings were discarded when leak current exceeded −50 pA, R<sub>s</sub> exceeded 15 MΩ or offset potential fluctuated more than 5 mV. Current voltage (IV) relations were recorded around 1 minute after rupturing the cell, by applying increasing step-depolarisation pulses of voltage ranging from −86.2 mV to 58.8 mV, in steps of 5 mV. Depolarisation pulses of 500 ms were used for measure Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 inactivation in Supplementary Fig. 6.</p>
<p>For Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging experiments, we used a Yokogawa CSU-X1A spinning-disk confocal scanner, mounted on an upright microscope (Zeiss Examiner) with a 63X, 1.0 NA objective (W Plan-Apochromat, Zeiss). Images were acquired using an Andor Zyla sCMOS 4.2 camera, controlled by <italic>VisiView</italic> 5.0 software (Visitron Systems GmbH). GFP, mKATE2 and the low-affinity Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator Calbryte590 were excited by a VS Laser Merge System (Visitron Systems) with 488 and 561 nm laser lines. Spinning disk was set to 5000 rpm. mKATE2 positive cells showing peripheral GFP expression (indicative of RIBEYE and palm-Bassoon co-expression) were identified and used for recordings. The cell was loaded for approximately a minute with Calbryte590 dye, after which we applied step depolarizations of 20 ms from −83 to +62 mV in 5-mV step increments to measure Ca<sup>2+</sup> current (density)–voltage relations. Next, a central plane of the cell was selected and the GFP fluorescence (green channel) of the cell showing <italic>SyRibbons</italic> was imaged. This was immediately followed by imaging of the increments of Calbryte590 fluorescence (red channel) in the same plane triggered by a depolarizing pulse to +2 mV for 500 ms (frame rate = 20 Hz). For Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging experiments, we also included occasionally occurring HEK293 cells which were electrically coupled with other neighbouring HEK293 cells. For such cells, we could not fully compensate for the slow capacitive currents and we did not use them for electrophysiological analysis.</p>

<title>Analysis of confocal images</title>
<p>All images were processed using NIH ImageJ software to make z-projections and multi-channel composites, and figures were created using Adobe Illustrator. For analysis of membrane distribution, a region of interest (ROI) of 1 µm thickness was drawn along the periphery of the cell which was identified either using Na, K ATPase α<sub>1</sub> immunofluorescence or by enhancing the contrast in images of transfected cells so that the cell boundary becomes distinguishable. Mean pixel intensity was measured along this ROI and for the area enclosed within the ROI. The ratio of the mean pixel intensity (periphery: inside) per cell was reported as an average from at least three central planes; we did not use the basal and top plane. For volumetric fits of <italic>SyRibbons,</italic> IHC ribbons and Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel clusters, we used the inbuilt surface detection algorithm from Imaris 9.6 (Oxford Instruments). The surface detail was set to 0.16 µm and largest sphere diameters for background subtraction were set as follows: for RIBEYE/CtBP2 0.3 µm, for Bassoon 0.1 µm and for Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 0.08 µm. Thresholding was performed based on the quality of immunofluorescence to ensure all discernible surfaces were detected. All surfaces with less than 10 voxels were filtered out. A manual check was done to include undetected surfaces, remove surfaces not localizing within cell of interest, and split surfaces that would occasionally be clubbed together. For analysis of <italic>SyRibbons</italic>, only RIBEYE surfaces colocalizing with palm-Bassoon surfaces were used for quantifications (at 0.06 µm or less). Occasionally we would detect surfaces with volumes larger than 2 µm<sup>3</sup> (usually cytosolic) or smaller than 0.02 µm<sup>3</sup>, which were not considered for analysis. For Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 cluster volumetric analysis in tetra-transfected cells, clusters classified as <italic>+SyRibbons</italic> were at 0.045 µm or less from palm-Bassoon positive RIBEYE surfaces. All other clusters were classified as <italic>–SyRibbons</italic>. Only clusters localized at the periphery of the cell were used for analysis. Pixel-based intensity correlation analysis was performed using the <italic>Coloc 2</italic> plugin on ImageJ (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://imagej.net/Coloc_2">http://imagej.net/Coloc_2</ext-link>). Analysis was performed on 1 µm thick regions of interests marking the periphery of the cell in at least three central planes (excluding the basal and top plane). Costes method was implemented with 100 repetitions to test for statistical significance of colocalisation coefficients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Costes <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>).</p>

<title>Analysis of patch clamp and Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging data</title>
<p>Analysis of electrophysiology data and figure preparation was performed using Igor Pro 6 and 7 (WaveMetrics Inc.) and final figures were compiled using Adobe Illustrator. For analyzing current density-voltage relations (IVs), the evoked Ca<sup>2+</sup> current was averaged from 5 to 10 ms after depolarization start. Cells expressing current amplitudes less than −49 pA and with current density greater than −60 pA/pF were not taken into account for analysis.</p>
<p>Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging data analysis was performed using a customized script in ImageJ. Briefly, we performed background subtraction in time series with Calbryte590 signal and then averaged 5 frames before stimulation and subtracted these from an average of three frames during stimulation to obtain ΔF images. For visualization, the images were smoothened (3 X 3 unweighted smoothening) and a composite was created by overlaying the ΔF images and the RIBEYE-GFP channel. For analyzing ΔF/F<sub>0</sub>, we drew circular regions of interest (ROIs) of 2µm diameter at sites with and without <italic>SyRibbons</italic> in the background subtracted time series. The ΔFmax/F<sub>0</sub> was calculated as the of average ΔF/F<sub>0</sub> in first three frames of peak Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal intensity at stimulation onset in each ROI. To minimize bias while assigning regions as with or without <italic>SyRibbons</italic>, ROIs were assigned in the RIBEYE-GFP channel, without looking at the corresponding Calbryte590 signal.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this manuscript, the authors attempt to reconstitute some active zone properties by introducing synaptic ribbon proteins into HEK cells. This &quot;ground-up&quot; approach can be valuable for assessing the necessity of specfic proteins in synaptic function. Here, the authors co-transfect a membrane-targeted bassoon, RBP2, calcium channel subunits and Ribeye to generate what they call &quot;synthetic ribbons&quot;. The resultant structures show an ability to cluster calcium channels (Figure 4B) and a modest ability to concentrate calcium entry locations (figure 7J). At the light level, the ribeye aggregates look spherical and localize to the membrane through its interaction with the membrane-targeted bassoon and at the EM level the structures resemble those observed when Ribeye is overexpressed alone. It is a nice proof-of-principle in establishing a useful experimental system for studying calcium channel localization and with expression of other proteins perhaps a means to understanding structure and function of the ribbon. The paper does establish that previously described protein-interactions can be reconstituted in a heterologous system to and that the addition of Ribeye can increase the size of calcium channel patches via indirect interactions.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) The authors establish a new experimental system for the study of calcium channel localization to active zones.</p>
<p>
(2) The clustering of calcium channels to bassoon via RBP2 is a nice confirmation of a previously-described interaction between bassoon and calcium channels in a cell-based system</p>
<p>
(3) The &quot;ground-up&quot; approach is an attractive one and theoretically allows one learn a lot about the essential interactions for building a ribbon structure.</p>
<p>
(4) The finding that introducing Ribeye can enhance the size of calcium channel patches is a novel finding that is interesting.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) The addition of EM is welcome, but the structures seem to resemble those created by overexpression of Ribeye alone, albeit at the membrane. It is unclear to me whether the interaction with Bsn or indirect interactions with other proteins has any effect on these structures. Also, while the abstract mentions that the size and shape are similar to ribbons, the EM seems to show that the size and shape are quite variable.</p>
<p>
(2) The clustering of channels is accomplished by taking advantage of previously described interactions between RBP2, Ca channels and bassoon. While it is nice to see that it can be reconstituted in a naive cell, the interactions were previously described. The localization of Ribeye to bassoon takes advantage of a previously described interaction between the two and the membrane localization of the complexes required introduction of a membrane-anchoring motif. These factors limit the novelty of the findings.</p>
<p>
(3) The difference in Ca imaging between SyRibbons and other locations is subtle. While there are reasonable explanations for why this could be the case, it may limit the utility of this system for studying Ca-channel-ribbon dynamics moving forward.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors show that co-expression of bassoon, RIBEYE, Cav1.3-alpha1, Cav-beta3, Cav-alpha2delta1, and RBP2 in a heterologus system (HEK293 cells) is sufficient to generate a protein complex resembling a presyanptic ribbon-type active zone both in morphology and in function (in clustering voltage-gated Ca channels and creating sites for localized Ca2+ entry). If the 3 separate Cav gene products are taken as a single protein (i.e. a Ca channel), the conclusion is that the core of a ribbon synapse comprises 4 proteins: bassoon holds the RIBEYE-containing ribbon to the plasma membrane, and RPB2 binds to bassoon and Ca channels, tethering the Ca channels to the presynaptic active zone.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) Good use of a heterologous system with generally appropriate controls provides convincing evidence that a presynaptic ribbon-type active zone (without the ability to support exocytosis), with the ability to support localized Ca2+ entry (a key feature of ribbon-type pre-synapses) can be assembled from a few proteins.</p>
<p>
(2) In the revised manuscript, the authors do a good job of addressing the limitations of their cultured cell-system.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) Relies on over-expression, which almost certainly diminishes the experimentally-measured parameters (e.g. pre-synapse clustering, localization of Ca2+ entry).</p>

(2) Are HEK cells the best model? HEK cells secrete substances and have a studied-endocytitic pathway, but they do not create neurosecretory vesicles. Initially, I asked why didn't the authors did not try to reconstitute a ribbon synapse in a cell that makes neurosecretory vesicles like a PC12 cell, and the authors addressed this question in their revision.</p>
<p>
(3) Related to 1 and 2: the Ca channel localization observed is significant but not so striking given the presence of Cav protein and measurements of Ca2+ influx distributed across the membrane. Presumably, this is the result of overexpression and an absence of pathways for pre-synaptic targeting of Ca channels. But, still, it was surprising that Ca channel localization was so diffuse. I suppose that the authors tried to reduce the effect of over-expression by using an inducible Cav1.3? Even so, the accessory subunits were constitutively over-expressed.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Ribbon synapses are complex molecular assemblies responsible for synaptic vesicle trafficking in sensory cells of the eye and the inner ear. The Ca2+-dependent exocytosis occurs at the active zone (AZ), however, the molecular mechanisms orchestrating the structure and function of the AZs of ribbon synapses are not well understood. To advance in the understanding of those mechanisms, the authors present a novel and interesting experimental strategy pursuing the reconstitution of a minimal active zone of a ribbon synapse within a synapse-naïve cell line: HEK293 cells. The authors have used stably transfected HEK293 cells that express voltage-gated Ca2+ channels subunits (constitutive -CaV beta3 and CaV alpha2 beta1- and inducible CaV1.3 alpha1). They have expressed in those cells several proteins of the ribbon synapse active zone: (1) RIBEYE, (2) a modified version of Bassoon that binds to the plasma membrane through artificial palmitoylation (Palm-Bassoon) and (3) RIM-binding protein 2 (RBP2) to induce the formation of a minimal active zone that they called SyRibbons. The formation of such structures is convincing, however, the evidence of such structures having a functional impact (for example enhancing Ca2+-currents), as the authors claim, is weak. In conclusion, the novel approach shows that expression of a multiprotein complex partially reproduces properties, especially structural properties, of ribbon-type active zones in a heterologous system. Although the approach opens interesting possibilities for further experiments, the evidence supporting the functional properties of the so called &quot;synthetic ribbon synapses&quot; is incomplete.</p>
<p>Strengths of the study:</p>
<p>(1) The study is carefully carried out using a remarkable combination of (1) superresolution, correlative light microscopy and cryo-electron tomography, to analyze the formation and subcellular distribution of molecular assemblies and (2) functional assessment of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels using patch-clamp recording of Ca2+-currents and fluorometry to correlate Ca2+ influx with the molecular assemblies formed by AZ proteins. The results are of high quality and are in general accompanied of required control experiments.</p>
<p>
(2) The method opens new opportunities to further investigate the minimal and basic properties of AZ proteins that are difficult to study using in vivo systems. The cells that operate through ribbon synapses (e.g. photoreceptors and hair cells) are particularly difficult to manipulate, so setting up and validating the use of a heterologous system more suitable for molecular manipulations is highly valuable.</p>
<p>
(3) The structures formed by RIBEYE and Palm-Bassoon in HEK293 cells identified by STED nanoscopy and cryo-electron microscopy share relevant similarities similar to the AZs of ribbon synapses found in rat inner hair cells.</p>
<p>Weaknesses of the study:</p>
<p>(1) The evidence of the functional properties of the &quot;synthetic ribbon-type active zones&quot; has been only assessed by its effect on the modulation of Ca2+-channel function, and that effect is rather weak. The authors provide reasonable explanations regarding such a weak effect but, however, it is difficult to conclude that indeed the &quot;synthetic ribbon-type active zones&quot; are bona fide functional multiprotein complexes.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews</p>

<p><bold>Life Assessment</bold></p>
<p>The authors use a synthetic approach to introduce synaptic ribbon proteins into HEK cells and analyze the ability of the resulting assemblies to cluster calcium channels at the active zone. The use of this ground-up approach is valuable as it establishes a system to study molecular interactions at the active zone. The work relies on a solid combination of super-resolution microscopy and electrophysiology, but would benefit from: (i) additional ultrastructural analysis to establish ribbon formation (in the absence of which the claim of these being synthetic ribbons might not be supported; (ii) data quantification (to confirm colocalization of different proteins); (iii) stronger validation of impact on Ca2+ function; (iv) in depth discussion of problems derived from the use of an over-expression approach.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the editors and the reviewers for the constructive comments and appreciation of our work. Please find a detailed point-to-point response below. In response to the critique received, we have now (i) included an ultrastructural analysis of the <italic>SyRibbons</italic> using correlative light microscopy and cryo-electron tomography, (ii) performed quantifications to confirm the colocalisation of the various proteins, (iii) discussed and carefully rephrased our interpretation of the role of the ribbon in modulating Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel function and (iv) discussed concerns regarding the use of an overexpression system.</p>

<p>We would like to thank the reviewer for the comments and advice to further improve our manuscript. We have completely overhauled the manuscript taking the suggestions of the reviewer into account.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(1) Are these truly &quot;synthetic ribbons&quot;. The ribbon synapse is traditionally defined by its morphology at the EM level. To what extent these structures recapitulate ribbons is not shown. It has been previously shown that Ribeye forms aggregates on its own. Do these structures look any more ribbonlike than ribeye aggregates in the absence of its binding partners?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank reviewer 1 for their constructive feedback and critique of the work.</p>
<p>We agree that traditionally, ribbon synapses have always been defined by the distinct morphology observed at the EM level. However, since the discovery of the core-components of ribbons (RIBEYE and Piccolino) confocal and super-resolution imaging of immunofluorescently labelled ribbons have gained importance for analysing ribbon synapses. A correspondence of RIBEYE immunofluorescent structures at the active zone to electron microscopy observations of ribbons has been established in numerous studies (Wong et al, 2014; Michanski et al, 2019, 2023; Maxeiner et al, 2016; Jean et al, 2018) even though direct correlative approaches have yet to be performed to our knowledge. We have now analysed <italic>SyRibbons</italic> using cryo-correlative electron-light microscopy. We observe that GFPpositive RIBEYE spots corresponded well with electron-dense structures, as is characteristic for synaptic ribbons (Robertis &amp; Franchi, 1956; Smith &amp; Sjöstrand, 1961; Matthews &amp; Fuchs, 2010). We could also observe <italic>SyRibbons</italic> within 100 nm of the plasma membrane (see Fig. 3). We have now added this qualitative ultrastructural analysis of <italic>SyRibbons</italic> in the main manuscript (lines 272 - 294, Fig. 3 and Supplementary Fig. 3).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) No new biology is discovered here. The clustering of channels is accomplished by taking advantage of previously described interactions between RBP2, Ca channels and bassoon. The localization of Ribeye to bassoon takes advantage of a previously described interaction between the two. Even the membrane localization of the complexes required the introduction of a membraneanchoring motif.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We respectfully disagree with the overall assessment. Our study emphasizes the synthetic establishment of protein assemblies that mimic key aspects of ribbon-type active zone, defining minimum molecular requirements. Numerous previous studies have described the role of the synaptic ribbon in organising the spatial arrangement of Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels, regulating their abundance and possibly also modulating their physiological properties (Maxeiner et al, 2016; Frank et al, 2010; Jean et al, 2018; Wong et al, 2014; Grabner &amp; Moser, 2021; Lv et al, 2016). We would like to highlight that there remain major gaps between existing in vitro and in vivo data; for instance, no evidence for direct or indirect interactions between Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels and RIBEYE have been demonstrated so far. While we do indeed take advantage of previously known interactions between RIBEYE and Bassoon (tom Dieck et al, 2005); between Bassoon, RBP2 and P/Q-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels (Davydova et al, 2014); and between RBP2 and Ltype Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels (Hibino et al, 2002), our study tries to bridge these gaps by establishing the indirect link between the synaptic ribbon (RIBEYE) and L-type CaV1.3 Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels using a bottom-up approach, which has previously just been speculative. Our data shows how even in a synapse-naive heterologous expression system, ribbon synapse components assemble Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel clusters and even show a partial localisation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal. Moreover, we argue that the established reconstitution approach provides other interesting insights such as laying ground-up evidence supporting the anchoring of the synaptic ribbon by Bassoon. Finally, we expect that the established system will serve future studies aimed at deciphering the role of putative CaV1.3 or CaV1.4 interacting proteins in regulating Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels of ribbon synapses by providing a more realistic Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel assembly that has been available in heterologous expression systems used so far. In response to the reviewers comment we have augmented the discussion accordingly.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) The only thing ribbon-specific about these &quot;syn-ribbons&quot; is the expression of ribeye and ribeye does not seem to participate in the localization of other proteins in these complexes. Bsn, Cav1.3 and RBP2 can be found in other neurons.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The synaptic ribbon made of RIBEYE is the key molecular difference in the molecular AZ ultrastructure of ribbon synapses in the eye and the ear. We hypothesize the ribbon to act as a superscaffold that enables AZ with large Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel assemblies and readily releasable pools. In further support of this hypothesis, the present study on synthetic ribbons shows that CaV1.3 Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel clusters are larger in the presence of <italic>SyRibbons</italic> compared to <italic>SyRibbon</italic>-less CaV1.3 Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel clusters in tetratransfected HEK cells (Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels, RBP, membrane-anchored Bassoon, and RIBEYE, Fig. 6). In response to the reviewers comment we now added an analysis of triple-transfected HEK cells (Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels, RBP, membrane-anchored Bassoon), in which CaV1.3 Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel clusters again are significantly smaller than at the <italic>SyRibbons</italic> and indistinguishable from <italic>SyRibbon</italic>-less CaV1.3 Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel clusters (Fig. 6E, F).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) As the authors point out, RBP2 is not necessary for some Ca channel clustering in hair cells, yet seems to be essential for clustering to bassoon here.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Here we would like to clarify that RBP2 is indeed important in inner hair cells for promoting a larger complement of CaV1.3 and RBP2 KO mice show smaller CaV1.3 channel clusters and reduced whole cell and single-AZ Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx amplitudes (Krinner et al, 2017). However, a key point of difference we emphasize on is that even though CaV1.3 clusters appeared smaller, they did not appear broken or fragmented as they do upon genetic perturbation of Bassoon (Frank et al, 2010), RIBEYE (Jean et al, 2018) or Piccolino (Michanski et al, 2023). This highlights how there may be a hierarchy in the spatial assembly of CaV1.3 channels at the inner hair cell ribbon synapse (also described in the discussion section “insights into presynaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel clustering and function”) with proteins like RBP2 regulating abundance of CaV1.3 channels at the synapse and organising them into smaller clusters – what we have termed as “nanoclustering”; while Bassoon and RIBEYE may serve as super-scaffolds further organizing these CaV1.3 nanoclusters into “microclusters”. Observations of fragmented Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel clusters and broader spread of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal seen upon Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging in RIBEYE and Bassoon mutants (Jean et al, 2018; Frank et al, 2010; Neef et al, 2018), and the absence of such a phenotype in RBP2 mutants (Krinner et al, 2017) may be explained by such a differential role of these proteins in organising Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel spatial assembly. The data of the present study on reconstituted ribbon containing AZs are in line with these observations in inner hair cells: RBP2 appears important to tether Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels to Bassoon and these AZ-like assemblies are organised to their full extent by the presence of RIBEYE. As mentioned in the response to point 3 of the reviewer, we have now further strengthened this point by adding the analysis of <italic>SyRibbon</italic>-less CaV1.3 Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel clusters in tripletransfected HEK cells (Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels, RBP, membrane-anchored Bassoon, Fig. 6E, F). Moreover, we have revised the discussion accordingly.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) The difference in Ca imaging between SyRibbons and other locations is extremely subtle.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the reviewer on the modest increase in Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal amplitude seen in the presence of  <italic>SyRibbons</italic> and provide the following reasoning for this observation:</p>
<p>(i) It is plausible that due to the overexpression approach, Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels (along with RBP2 and PalmBassoon) still show considerably high expression throughout the membrane even in regions where <italic>SyRibbons</italic> are not localised. Indeed, this is evident in the images shown in the lower panel in Fig. 6B, where Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel immunofluorescence is distributed across the plasma membrane with larger clusters formed underneath <italic>SyRibbons</italic> (for an opposing scenario, please see the cell in Fig. 6B upper panel with very localised CaV1.3 distribution underneath <italic>SyRibbons</italic>). This would of course diminish the difference in the Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals between membrane regions with and without <italic>SyRibbons</italic>. We note that while the contrast is greater for native synapses, extrasynaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels have been described in numerous studies alone for hair cells (Roberts et al, 1990; Brandt, 2005; Zampini et al, 2010; Wong et al, 2014).</p>
<p>(ii) Nevertheless, we do not expect a remarkably big difference in Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx due to the presence of <italic>SyRibbons</italic> in the first place. Ribbon-less AZs in inner hair cells of RIBEYE KO mice showed normal Ca<sup>2+</sup> current amplitudes at the whole-cell and the single-AZ level (Jean et al, 2018). However, it was the spatial spread of the Ca2+ signal at the single-AZ level which appeared to be broader and more diffuse in these mutants in the absence of the ribbon, in contrast to the more confined Ca2+ hotspots seen in the wild-type controls.</p>
<p>So, in agreement with these published observations – it appears that presence of <italic>SyRibbons</italic> helps in spatially confining the Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal by super scaffolding nanoclusters into microclusters (see also our response to points 3 and 4 of the reviewer): this is evident from seeing some spatial confinement of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals near <italic>SyRibbons</italic> on top of the diffuse Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal across the rest of the membrane as a result of overexpression in HEK cells.</p>
<p>We have now carefully rephrased our interpretation throughout the manuscript and added further explanation in the discussion section.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(6) The effect of the expression of palm-Bsn, RBP2 and the combination of the two on Ca-current is ambiguous. It appears that while the combination is larger than the control, it probably isn't significantly different from either of the other two alone (Fig 5). Moreover, expression of Ribeye + the other two showed no effect on Ca current (Figure 7). Also, why is the IV curve right shifted in Figure 7 vs Figure 5?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the reviewer that co-expression of palm-Bassoon and RBP2 seems to augment Ca<sup>2+</sup> currents, while the additional expression of RIBEYE results in no change when compared to wild-type controls. We currently do not have an explanation for this observation and would refrain from making any claims without concrete evidence. As the reviewer also correctly pointed out, while the expression of the combination of palm-Bassoon and RBP2 raises Ca<sup>2+</sup> currents, current amplitudes are not significantly different when compared to the individual expression of the two proteins (P &gt; 0.05, Kruskal-Wallis test). In light of this, we have now carefully rephrased our MS. Moreover, we would like to thank reviewer 1 for pointing out the right shift in the IV curve which was due to an error in the values plotted on the x-axis. This has been corrected in the updated version of the manuscript.</p>

<p>(7) While some of the IHC is quantified, some of it is simply shown as single images. EV2, EV3 and Figure 4a in particular (4b looks convincing enough on its own, but could also benefit from a larger sample size and quantification)</p>

<p>We have now added quantifications for the colocalisations of the various transfection combinations depicted in the above-mentioned figures collectively in Supplementary Figure 7 and added the corresponding results and methods accordingly.</p>

<p>(2) Are HEK cells the best model? HEK cells secrete substances and have a studied-endocytitic pathway, but they do not create neurosecretory vesicles. Why didn't the authors try to reconstitute a ribbon synapse in a cell that makes neurosecretory vesicles like a PC12 cell?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This is a valid point for discussion that we also had here extensively. We indeed did consider pheochromocytoma cells (PC12 cells) for reconstitution of ribbon-type AZs and also performed initial experiments with these in the initial stages of the project. PC12 cells offer the advantage of providing synaptic-like microvesicles and also endogenously express several components of the presynaptic machinery such as Bassoon, RIM2, ELKS etc (Inoue et al, 2006) such that overexpression of exogenous AZ proteins would have to be limited to RIBEYE only.</p>
<p>However, a major drawback of PC12 cells as a model is the complex molecular background of these cells. We have also briefly described this in the discussion section (line 615 – 619). Naïve, undifferentiated PC12 cells show highly heterogeneous expression of various CaV channel types (Janigro et al, 1989); however, CaV1.3, the predominant type in ribbon synapses of the ear, does not seem to express in these cells (Liu et al, 1996). Furthermore, our attempts at performing immunostainings against CaV1.3 and at overexpressing CaV1.3 in PC12 cells did not prove successful and we decided on refraining from pursuing this further (data not shown).</p>
<p>On the contrary, HEK293 cells being “synapse-naïve” provide the advantage of serving as a “blank canvas” for performing such reconstitutions, e.g. they lack voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels and multidomain proteins of the active zone. Moreover, an important practical aspect for our choice was the availability of the HEK293 cell line with stable (and inducible) expression of the CaV1.3 Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel complex. Finally, as described in lines 613 – 614 of the discussion section, even though HEK293 cells lack SVs and the molecular machinery required for their release, our work paves way for future studies which could employ delivery of SV machinery via co-expression (Park et al, 2021) which could then be analyzed by the correlative light and electron microscopy workflow we worked out and added during revision.</p>

<p>We agree with the reviewer on the modest increase in Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal amplitude seen in the presence of <italic>SyRibbons</italic>. Yes, we employed inducible expression of the CaV1.3a subunit and tried to reduce the effect of overexpression by testing different induction times. However, we did not observe any major differences in expression and observed large variability in CaV1.3 expression across cells irrespective of induction duration. At all time points, there were cells with diffuse CaV1.3 localisation also in regions without <italic>SyRibbons</italic> which likely reduced the contrast of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal we observe.

<p>(2) The authors analyzed the distribution of RIBEYE clusters in different membrane compartments and correctly conclude that RIBEYE clusters are not trapped in any of those compartments, but it is soluble instead. The authors, however, did not carry out a similar analysis for Palm-Bassoon. It is therefore unknown if Palm-Bassoon binds to other membrane compartments besides the plasma membrane. That could occur because in non-neuronal cells GAP43 has been described to be in internal membrane compartments. This should be investigated to document the existence of ectopic internal Synribbons beyond the plasma membrane because it might have implications for interpreting functional data in case Ca2+-channels become part of those internal Synribbons.</p>

<p>In response to this valid concern, we have now included the suggested experiment in Supplementary Figure 1. We investigated the subcellular localisation of Palm-Bassoon and did not find Palm-Bassoon puncta to colocalise with ER, Golgi, or lysosomal markers, suggesting against a possible binding with membrane compartments inside the cell. We have added the following sentence in the results section, line 145 : “Palm-Bassoon does not appear to localize in the ER, Golgi apparatus or lysosomes (Supplementary Fig 1 D, E and F).”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) The co-expression of RBP2 and Palm-Bassoon induces a rather minor but significant increase in Ca2+-currents (Figure 5). Such an increase does not occur upon expression of (1) Palm-Bassoon alone, (2) RBP2 alone or (3) RIBEYE alone (Figure 5). Intriguingly, the concomitant expression of PalmBassoon, RBP2 and RIBEYE does not translate into an increase of Ca2+-currents either (Figure 7).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the reviewer that co-expression of palm-Bassoon and RBP2 seems to augment Ca<sup>2+</sup> currents, while the additional expression of RIBEYE results in no change when compared to wild-type controls. We currently do not have an explanation for this observation and would refrain from making any claims without concrete evidence. We also highlight that, while the expression of the combination of palm-Bassoon and RBP2 raises Ca<sup>2+</sup> currents, current amplitudes are not significantly different when compared to the individual expression of the two proteins (P &gt; 0.05, Kruskal-Wallis test). In light of this, we have now carefully rephrased our MS.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) The authors claim that Ca2+-imaging reveals increased CA2+-signal intensity at synthetic ribbontype AZs. That claim is a subject of concern because the increase is rather small and it does not correlate with an increase in Ca2+-currents.</p>

<p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>(1) The authors should have a better discussion of problems derived from over-expression.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Done. Please see above.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) Ideally, the authors would repeat the study using a secretory cell line, but this is of course not possible. The idea could be brought forth, though.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As described above in our response to the public review of reviewer 2, we have discussed this idea in the discussion section (refer to lines 615 – 619), emphasizing on both the advantages and the limitations of using a secretory cell line (e.g. PC12 cells) instead of HEK293 cells as a model for performing such reconstitutions.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>(1) There are several figures in which colocalization between different proteins is studied only displaying images but without any quantitative data. This should be corrected by providing such a quantitative analysis.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have now added quantifications for the colocalisations of the various transfection combinations depicted in the above-mentioned figures collectively in Supplementary Figure 7 and added the corresponding results and methods accordingly.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) The little increase in Ca2+-currents and Ca2+-influx associated to the clustering of Ca2+-channels to Synribbons is a concern. The authors should discuss if such a minor increase (found only when Palm-Bassoon and RBP2 ae co-expressed) would have or not physiological consequences in an actual synapse. They might discuss the comparison of those results and compare with results obtained in genetically modified mice in which Ca2+-currents are affected upon the removal of AZs proteins. On the other hand, they should explain why Ca2+-currents do not increase when the Synribbons are formed by RIBEYE, Palm-Bassoon and RBP2.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Done. Please see above.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) The description of the patch-clamp experiments should be enriched by including representative currents. Did the authors measure tail currents?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We would like to thank the reviewer for the valuable suggestion and have now added representative currents to the figures (see Supplementary Figure 5B). We agree with the reviewer on the importance of further characterizing the Ca<sup>2+</sup> currents in the presence and absence of <italic>SyRibbons</italic> by analysis of tail currents for counting the number of Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels by non-stationary fluctuation analysis but consider this to be out of scope of the current study and an objective for future studies.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) The current displayed in Figure 7 E should be explained better.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Previous studies have shown that Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding proteins (CaBPs) compete with Calmodulin to reduce Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent inactivation (CDI) and promote sustained Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx in Inner Hair Cells (Cui et al, 2007; Picher et al, 2017). In the absence of CaBPs, CaV1.3-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> currents show more rapid CDI as in the case here upon heterologous expression in HEK cells ((Koschak et al, 2001), see also Picher et al 2017 where co-expression of CaBP2 with CaV1.3 inhibits CDI in HEK293 cells). The inactivation kinetics of CaV1.3 are also regulated by the subunit composition (Cui et al, 2007) along with the modulation via interaction partners and given the reconstitution here we do not find the currents very surprising.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) Is the difference in Ca2+-influx still significantly higher upon the removal of the maximum value measured in positive Syribbons spots (Figure 7, panel K)?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Yes, on removing the maximum value, the P value increases from 0.01 to 0.03 but remains statistically significant.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(6) In summary, although the approach pioneered by the authors is exciting and provides relevant results, there is a major concern regarding the interpretation of the modulation of Ca2+ channels.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have now carefully rephrased our interpretation on the modulation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels.</p>
