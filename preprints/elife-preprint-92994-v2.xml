<title>Abstract</title><p>The balanced gut microbiota in intestinal mucus layer plays an instrumental role in the health of the host. However, the mechanisms by which the host regulates microbial communities in the mucus layer remain largely unknown. Here, we discovered that the host regulates bacterial colonization in the gut mucus layer by producing a protein called Chitinase 3-like protein 1 (Chi3l1). Intestinal epithelial cells are stimulated by the gut microbiota to express Chi3l1. Once expressed, Chi3l1 is secreted into the mucus layer where it interacts with the gut microbiota, specifically through a component of bacterial cell walls called peptidoglycan. This interaction between Chi3l1 and bacteria is beneficial for the colonization of bacteria in the mucus, particularly for gram-positive bacteria like <italic>Lactobacillus</italic>. Moreover, a deficiency of Chi3l1 leads to an imbalance in the gut microbiota, which exacerbates colitis induced by dextran sodium sulfate (DSS). By performing fecal microbiota transplantation from Villin-cre mice or replenishing <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> in IEC<sup>ΔChil1</sup> mice, we were able to restore their colitis to the same level as that of Villin-cre mice. In summary, this study shows a “scaffold model” for microbiota homeostasis by interaction between intestinal Chi3l1 and bacteria cell wall interaction, and it also highlights that an unbalanced gut microbiota in the intestinal mucus contributes to the development of colitis.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Intestinal homeostasis is crucial for maintaining human health[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>]. Alterations in gut microbiota composition have been linked to various diseases including cancer, obesity, and neurological disorders[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>]. Dysbiosis, which refers to an imbalance in gut microbiota, is characterized by decreased microbial diversity, the presence of harmful microbes, or absence of beneficial ones [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>]. Therefore, understanding the factors that influence gut microbiota is a fundamental goal in microbiome research[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>]. Growing evidence suggests that colonization of the gut mucus layer can affect the susceptibility and progression of intestinal diseases like inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), irritable bowel syndrome, and celiac disease[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>]. Inflammatory bowel diseases, such as Crohn’s disease (CD) and Ulcerative Colitis (UC), are characterized by chronic inflammation of the intestinal mucosa. Although the cause of the inflammatory bowel disease is unclear, mouse models lacking the key components of the mucus are predisposed to colitis, accompanied by dysbiosis in mucosa[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>], which is in accordance with increased epithelial-adherent microbial communities in biopsies from patients with IBD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>]. Furthermore, there were significant differences in the gut microbiota of CD patients compared with healthy controls, and these differences were only present in mucus samples (not stool samples), suggesting that bacteria in the mucus layer may be more important for the development of IBD[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>]. Donaldson et al. discovered that the intestinal flora utilizes host immunoglobulin A (IgA) for mucus colonization, indicating that the host may secrete certain factors to maintain intestinal flora homeostasis in the mucus[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>]. However, the mechanisms regulating gut microbiota colonization in the mucus layer remain largely unknown. We aim to investigate the regulation of microbial communities in gut mucus and its implications in intestinal diseases.</p>
<p>Chitinase 3-like protein 1 (Chi3l1, also known as YKL-40 in humans) is a secreted protein that belongs to the glycosylhydrolase 18 family[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>]. Despite its name, Chi3l1 can bind to chitin but does not have chitinase activity[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>]. In our investigation, we noticed that chitin and peptidoglycan, a major component of bacterial cell walls, have similar structures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>]. Based on this information, we speculate that Chi3l1 might also interact with peptidoglycan and, therefore, interact with bacteria. Interestingly, Chi3l1 is expressed in intestinal epithelial cells and the lamina propria. We hypothesize that Chi3l1 may be secreted by intestinal epithelial cells and regulate the gut microbiota through its interaction with peptidoglycan in the mucous layer. In our study, we discovered that gut microbiota induce the expression of Chi3l1 in epithelial cells. Once expressed, Chi3l1 is secreted into the mucosa and interacts with bacteria, particularly with the bacterial cell wall component peptidoglycan. This interaction promotes bacterial colonization, especially of beneficial bacteria such as <italic>Lactobacillus</italic>. As a result, mice with higher levels of Chi3l1 are less susceptible to colitis.</p>

<title>Intestinal epithelial cells express Chi3l1 induced by gut microbiota</title>
<p>The gut microbiota’s composition is shaped by host factors, including IgA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>], RegIIIγ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>], and TLR-5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>]. Yet, specific host factors which maintain the homeostasis of the microbiota remain largely undefined. Drawing on the theory of co-evolution between the host and microbiota [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>], we propose that host factors, which are induced by bacteria in the gut, could play a pivotal role in regulating bacterial colonization and composition. In a previous study, it was observed that both live <italic>E.coli</italic> and heat-killed <italic>E.coli</italic> treatment resulted in a significant increase in the expression of the gene encoding Chi3l1 in human intestinal organoids[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>]. To verify this finding, we conducted immunohistochemical staining on intestinal tissue sections of germ-free and specific pathogen free (SPF) C57BL/6J wildtype mice. We observed a substantial increase of Chi3l1 expression in SPF mice compared to germ-free mice (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). The intestinal epithelium comprises various cell types, including intestinal cells, goblet cells, endoentercrine cells, Tuft cells, Paneth cells, M cells, and others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>]. To identify the cellular sources of Chi3l1, we performed co-staining with markers for specific cell types, including Chromogranin A (ChgA) for enteroendocrine cells, Ulex Europaeus Agglutinin I (UEA-1) for goblet cells and Paneth cells, and Double cortin-like kinase 1 (DCLK1) for tuft cells. Our results revealed that Chi3l1 is primarily expressed in enteroendocrine cells in the ileum and goblet or Paneth cells in the colon (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>). However, Chi3l1 expression was not observed in tuft cells (Supplementary Figure 1).</p>

<p>Furthermore, we isolated total bacteria from wildtype mouse feces and treated DLD-1 cells (a colorectal adenocarcinoma cell line) with the bacterial extract for 12 hours. We found that the bacterial extract directly induced Chi3l1 expression in DLD-1 cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>). To examine whether the induction of Chi3l1 expression require a specific bacteria strain, we further identified the bacterial extract using 16S rRNA sequencing. Our results revealed that <italic>E.coli</italic> specifically stimulated Chi3l1 expression in DLD-1 cells, while <italic>Staphylococcus Sciuri</italic> did not have the same effect (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>). Although our data are limited to these two bacterial strains, it suggest that not all bacteria can induce the expression of Chi3l1. Next, we wondered what component of bacteria can induce Chi3l1 expression. We tried heat-killed <italic>E.coli</italic>, which maintains bacterial cell wall integrity. We found that treatment of DLD-1 cells with heat-killed <italic>E.coli</italic> also led to an induction of Chi3l1 expression (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>). These findings suggest that the induction of Chi3l1 expression does not necessarily require live bacteria and that bacterial components alone are sufficient to induce this response.</p>
<p>Given that <italic>E. coli</italic> is Gram-negative and <italic>Staphylococcus sciuri</italic> is Gram-positive, we hypothesized that the difference in their ability to induce Chi3l1 expression might be due to variations between Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, such as the presence of lipopolysaccharides (LPS). To test this hypothesis, we used LPS to induce Chi3l1 expression. Consistent with our hypothesis, LPS successfully induced Chi3l1 expression (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F</xref>&amp;G). Collectively, these findings provide evidence that the gut microbiota can induce Chi3l1 expression in intestinal epithelial cells.

<title>Chi3l1 interact with bacteria via peptidoglycan</title>
<p>Chi3l1 belongs to a group of proteins called non-enzymatic chitinase-like proteins, which are known to bind chitin. Chitin is a polysaccharide present in the exoskeleton of arthropods and the cell walls of fungi[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>]. By comparing the structure of chitin with that of peptidoglycan (PGN), a component of bacterial cell walls, we observed that they have similar structures (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). Based on this observation, we hypothesized that Chi3l1 may interact with gut bacteria through PGN. To test our hypothesis, we conducted co-incubation experiments where we mixed recombinant mouse Chi3l1 (rmChi3l1) with either Gram-positive or Gram-negative bacteria and then precipitated the bacteria through centrifugation. We found that rmChi3l1 was present in the pellet obtained from both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>), suggesting that Chi3l1 can directly interact with bacteria.</p>

</fig>
<p>To further investigate the interaction between Chi3l1 and PGN, we also co-incubated PGN with rmChi3l1 and precipitated the PGN through centrifugation. PGN is an insoluble substance and hence can be precipitated by centrifugation. Consistent with our previous results, we observed that rmChi3l1 was present in the pellet obtained from PGN but not in the pellet obtained from bovine serum albumin (BSA), which served as a negative control (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>). Furthermore, we also examined the interaction between PGN and recombinant human Chi3l1 (rhChi3l1) and obtained similar results (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>). These findings indicate that Chi3l1 interacts with bacteria through PGN.</p>
<p>To better characterize the binding between Chi3l1 and peptidoglycan (PGN), we compared the binding affinities of Chi3l1 to both PGN and chitin. We incubated chitin and PGN with rmChi3l1 in increasing doses (25, 50, 100 μg) and detected the precipitated rmChi3l1 by either chitin or PGN. Our results indicate that Chi3l1 interacts with PGN in a dose-dependent manner (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>). In contrast, the binding between Chi3l1 and chitin did not exhibit dose dependency (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>). These findings suggest a specific and distinct binding mechanism for Chi3l1 with PGN compared to chitin.</p>
<p>To investigate whether the Chi3l1-PGN interaction could facilitate the colonization of gram-positive bacteria, we conducted adhesion experiments using DLD-1 cells and bacteria. We employed a GlmM mutant (PGN synthesis-deficient) and K12 bacteria (a wild-type E. coli strain used as a control) to assess their adhesion capabilities. The results showed that the adhesion ability of the GlmM mutant to cells significantly decreased (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>). Additionally, after knocking down Chi3l1 in DLD-1 cells (knockdown efficiency over 50%), we observed a decrease in bacterial adhesion (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2G</xref>). These findings suggest that the Chi3l1-PGN interaction plays a crucial role in bacterial adhesion.</p>

<title>Intestinal bacteria are disordered in IEC<sup>ΔChil1</sup> mice, especially Gram-positive bacteria</title>
<p>To gain initial insights into how the expression of Chi3l1 in intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) affects the colonization of gut microbiota, we created mice with a specific deficiency of Chi3l1 in IECs (referred to as IEC<sup>ΔChil1</sup> mice) (Supplementary Figure 2). We then conducted bacterial 16S rRNA sequencing analysis of the colon contents of both Villin-cre and IEC<sup>ΔChil1</sup> littermates. Our analysis of alpha diversity revealed that the bacterial population was relatively lower in IEC<sup>ΔChil1</sup> littermates compared to Villin-cre littermates (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). This finding was further confirmed by conducting universal bacterial 16S rRNA qPCR analysis of the feces and ileum contents of IEC<sup>ΔChil1</sup> and Villin-cre littermates, which also showed lower bacterial enrichment in IEC<sup>ΔChil1</sup> mice (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). Furthermore, principal component analysis demonstrated significant differences in bacterial diversity between Villin-cre and IEC<sup>ΔChil1</sup> littermates (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>).</p>

<p>When we examined the relative abundance of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria between Villin-cre and IEC<sup>ΔChil1</sup> littermates, we observed that Gram-positive bacteria were significantly reduced in IEC<sup>ΔChil1</sup> mice, while there was no notable difference in Gram-negative bacteria (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>). This result was further validated by staining lipoteichoic acid (LTA), a component present on Gram-positive bacteria, which revealed a lower abundance of Gram-positive bacteria in IEC<sup>ΔChil1</sup> compared to Villin-cre littermates (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>).

<title>Chi3l1 promotes the colonization of Gram-positive bacteria in intestinal mucus</title>
<p>Chi3l1 was found in secretory cells like goblet cells and Paneth cells, suggesting that it may be secreted into the intestinal lumen (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>). Immunohistochemistry staining of Chi3l1 in the colon revealed a large amount of Chi3l1 signals in the mucus layer (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>). Immunofluorescence co-staining of Chi3l1 with UEA-1 in the colon yielded similar results (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>). Furthermore, Chi3l1 was also detected in the ileum and colonic tissues and mucus layer (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>&amp;D). These findings indicate that mouse Chi3l1 is specifically expressed in intestinal secretory epithelial cells and secreted into the intestinal lumen. Since large amounts of Chi3l1 is secreted into the mucus and Chi3l1 interact with bacteria, we hypothesize that Chi3l1 may regulate the colonization of Gram-positive bacteria in the mucus layer. To test this hypothesis, we isolated bacterial DNA from the ileum and colon mucus of both wildtype and Chi11<sup>-/-</sup> mice. Quantification of Gram-positive bacteria and <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> using qPCR revealed that both the ileum and colon mucus of Chi11<sup>-/-</sup> mice had significantly lower levels of Gram-positive bacteria and <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> compared to that of wildtype mice (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E</xref>&amp;F).</p>

<p>To further validate these results, we labeled a Gram-positive bacteria strain, <italic>E. faecalis</italic>, with fluorescent D-amino acids (FDAA), which can metabolically label bacterial peptidoglycans[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>].

<title>Disordered intestinal bacteria in IEC<sup>ΔChil1</sup> mice contribute to colitis</title>
<p>From the above data, it is evident that Chi3l1 is secreted into the intestinal mucus to influence the colonization of Gram-positive bacteria, particularly <italic>Lactobacillus</italic>. We are now interested in understanding the role of Chi3l1-regulated microbiota in a pathological condition.

<p>To rule out the effects of Chi3l1 on the host contributed to colitis, we pretreated the mice with antibiotics to eliminate gut microbiota before inducing colitis (Supplementary Figure 4A). The Universal bacterial 16S rRNA qPCR data indicated that the majority of gut microbiota were eliminated after antibiotics treatment (Supplementary Figure 4B). However, the IEC<sup>ΔChil1</sup> mice exhibited a milder colitis phenotype, including slower body weight loss, longer colon length, and less inflammation compared to the Villin-cre mice (Supplementary Figure 4C-E). We believe that this could be due to the relationship between Chi3l1 and inflammation. Based on these findings, it is apparent that Chi3l1’s effects on gut microbiota play a more significant role in colitis.</p>
<p>To further elucidate the role of Chi3l1-regulated gut microbiota in colitis, we conducted fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) and <italic>Lactobacillus reuteri</italic> transplantation experiments. We first eliminated gut microbiota through a 10-day course of antibiotics and then performed FMT from Villin-cre mice or administered oral gavage of <italic>Lactobacillus reuteri</italic> to IEC<sup>ΔChil1</sup> mice for 2 weeks, followed by a 7-day period of 2% DSS feeding (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5F</xref>). FMT partially restored the colon length of IEC<sup>ΔChil1</sup> mice to that of Villin-cre mice after the DSS challenge, but did not have an impact on body weight loss or the level of inflammation in the gut (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5G-I</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The intricate relationship between gut bacteria and their host organisms is crucial for health, maintained through co-evolution and co-speciation. Understanding how the host influences these bacterial communities is critical to understand the complex interplay between host and gut bacteria. In this study, we discovered that Chi3l1 interacts with gut microbiota via peptidoglycan, aiding the mucus colonization of beneficial bacteria like <italic>Lactobacillus</italic>, which protects against colitis (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>). Our “scaffold model” demonstrates that Chi3l1 binds to bacterial peptidoglycan, helping anchor and organize bacteria within the mucus layer. This interaction promotes the colonization of beneficial bacteria, enhancing gut health.</p>
<fig id="fig6" position="float" orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure">
<label>Figure 6.</label>
<caption><title>A schematic working model.</title>
<p>Intestinal epithelial cells are stimulated by the gut microbiota to express Chi3l1. Once expressed, Chi3l1 is secreted into the mucus layer where it interacts with the gut microbiota, specifically through a component of bacterial cell walls called peptidoglycan. This interaction between Chi3l1 and bacteria is beneficial for the colonization of bacteria in the mucus, particularly for gram-positive bacteria like <italic>Lactobacillus</italic>. Moreover, a deficiency of Chi3l1 leads to an imbalance in the gut microbiota, which exacerbates colitis induced by dextran sodium sulfate (DSS).</p></caption>
<graphic xlink:href="560754v2_fig6.tif" mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image"/>
</fig>
<p>Several studies have suggested a potential correlation between Chi3l1 and bacteria. For instance, it has been demonstrated that Chi3l1 is produced by intestinal epithelial cells in enteritis disease and aids in the elimination of pathogenic bacteria in the gut by neutrophils[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>]. Another study observed an increase in Chi3l1 expression in mammary tissues of dairy cows infected with pathogenic <italic>E. coli</italic>, which promoted the recruitment of neutrophils[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>]. Furthermore, Chi3l1 was found to be induced during <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic> infection, where it enhanced bacterial elimination by preventing the death of lung macrophages and improving host tolerance[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>]. One study demonstrated that Chi3l1 contributes to the pathogenesis of colitis, possibly by facilitating the adhesion and invasion of bacteria onto colonic epithelial cells. However, we observed the presence of the Gram-negative bacterium <italic>Salmonella typhimurium</italic> in the mice used in their study[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>]. According to standard for SPF-grade mice, Salmonella should not be present in laboratory mice, and it was also not detected by our 16S RNA sequencing. However, if mice are inadvertently infected with Salmonella in the context of IBD, it could likely exacerbate the development of IBD. Our data also demonstrate that Chi3l1 can bind to Gram-negative bacteria (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). Therefore, the role of Chi3l1 on microbiota or IBD is heavily dependent on the environmental context. Another study found that caffeine treatment reduce Chi3l1 RNA expression levels, alleviate colitis, and decrease bacterial translocation[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>]. However, previous research suggested that caffeine can directly inhibit inflammasome activation by suppressing MAPK/NF-κB signaling pathways[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>]. Therefore, caffeine treatment may directly reduce colitis by inhibiting inflammation. Moreover, an additional control group of mice with Chi3l1 specifically knocked out in the gut is needed to examine the role of caffeine in the alleviation of colitis. However, the detailed mechanism of the interaction between Chi3l1 and the gut microbiota remains incompletely understood, partly due to the absence of Chi3l1-specific knockout mice and variations in mouse husbandry conditions. Here, by using intestinal Chi3l1-specific knockout mice, we demonstrated a new function of Chi3l1 in gut, which shapes bacterial colonozation through direct interaction with bacterial cell wall component, PGN. Moreover, Chi3l1-regulated gut microbiota, especially <italic>Lactobacillus</italic>, offers protection against colitis.</p>
<p>The bacterial cell wall is a complex structure mainly composed of peptidoglycan, but it may also contain other components such as teichoic acids and lipoteichoic acid in gram-positive bacteria, or an outer membrane containing various polysaccharides, lipids, and proteins in gram-negative bacteria[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>]. Our findings indicated that lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a component of the bacterial cell wall, can slightly increase Chi3l1 expression (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F</xref>&amp;G), but higher levels of LPS do not further enhance Chi3l1 expression (data not shown). This suggests that there might be other components of the cell wall that can induce Chi3l1 expression in intestinal epithelial cells. Given the structural similarity between chitin and peptidoglycan (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>), it is likely that Chi3l1 binds to the polysaccharide chains rather than the tetrapeptide in peptidoglycan. Previous studies have investigated the crystal structure of human Chi3l1 in complex with chitin, revealing a binding groove with different subsites for chitin fragments[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>]. Other studies have also identified specific amino acids in chitinases that play a key role in the interaction with chitin[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>]. Nevertheless, further investigation is necessary to better understand the binding sites in Chi3l1 for peptidoglycan.</p>
<p>In the colon, there are two distinct parts of the mucus layer. The inner layer is attached and has a low number of microbes, while the outer layer is looser and densely populated by microorganisms. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>]. The diversity of bacteria in the mucus layer is similar to that found in the gut lumen[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>]. It has to be noted that not all Gram-positive bacteria were reduced in Chil1<sup>-/-</sup> mice, as we found an increase in <italic>Turicibacter</italic> in the colon (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3G</xref>) and feces (data not shown). We believe this may be due to a combined effect of the host and gut microbiota. Another important factor for microbial growth in the colon is the integrity of the mucus barrier[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>].We noticed a thinning of the mucus barrier in the mice lacking Chi3l1 compared to normal mice (Supplementary Figure 3 A&amp;B).</p>
<p>However, we did not observe an increase in mucin-degrading bacteria such as <italic>Bacteroides</italic> or <italic>Allobaculum</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>] or a decrease in mucin-producing cells in these mice. We think that there may be bacteria that aid in the formation of the gut mucus, and these bacteria are decreased in mice lacking Chi3l1. Recent studies have introduced an “encapsulation model” regarding the nature of mucus in the colon. According to this model, the mucus in the proximal colon forms a primary encapsulation barrier around fecal material, while the mucus in the distal colon forms a secondary barrier.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>] Our findings indicate that Chi3l1 is expressed throughout the entire colon, including the proximal, middle, and distal sections (data not shown). This suggests that Chi3l1 likely promotes bacterial colonization across the entire colon. Despite most mucus being expelled with feces, the constant production of mucus and the minimal presence of Chi3l1 in feces (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>) indicate that Chi3l1 continuously plays a role in promoting the colonization of microbiota.</p>
<p>In patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), the density and diversity of the microbial community in the intestines are reduced. Specifically, there is a decrease in <italic>Firmicutes</italic> and an increase in <italic>Bacteroides</italic> and facultative anaerobic bacteria like <italic>Enterobacteriaceae</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>]. However, the cause of colitis in IBD is still a subject of debate. Our data suggest that disruptions in the gut microbiota contribute to colitis. In summary, our study demonstrates that bacterial challenge induces the expression of Chi3l1 in intestinal epithelial cells. Once produced, Chi3l1 is released into the mucus layer where it interacts with the gut microbiota, particularly through peptidoglycan, a primary component of bacterial cell walls. This interaction is beneficial for the colonization of bacteria, especially gram-positive bacteria like <italic>Lactobacillus</italic>, in the mucus layer. Dysbiosis resulting from a lack of Chi3l1 exacerbates DSS-induced colitis, highlighting the role of dysbiosis as a contributing factor to colitis.</p>

<title>Treatment of DLD-1 cells with live, heat-killed bacteria or LPS</title>
<p>Bacteria harvested from mouse feces or specific strains were grown in LB medium at 37°C for 12 hours under aerobic conditions. The bacteria were then collected by centrifugation (5000 x g for 10 min), washed, and resuspended in PBS at a density of 1.2 x 10<sup>10</sup> CFU/ml. Live bacteria were used directly, while heat-killed bacteria required further heating at 80°C for 30 minutes. DLD-1 cells were grown in DMEM medium supplemented with 10% FBS. Prior to treatment, the cells were replated and allowed to reach 80% confluency. Either live or heat-killed bacteria were added to the cells at a multiplicity of infection of 20 each well, and 100 pg/ml LPS treatment(Sigma, L4392; diluted in PBS) was also performed. After 12-hour incubation, cellular proteins were extracted for western blot analysis or the cells were subjected to immunofluorescent staining.</p>

<p>Fecal samples, ileum contents, and colon contents were collected from wildtype, Chil1<sup>-/-</sup> littermates, or Villin-cre, IEC<sup>ΔChil1</sup> littermates and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. The microbial genomic DNA was extracted and 16S rRNA sequencing was performed by Biomarker Technologies. The hypervariable regions V3 and V4 of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene were sequenced using universal primers that flank these regions V3 (338F 5’-ACTCCTACGGGAGGCAGCA-3’) and V4 (806R 5’-GGACTACHVGGGTWTCTAAT-3’). The sequencing was done using the IIIumina Sequencing platform. The resulting 16S rRNA gene sequences were analyzed using scripts from the BMK Cloud platform (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.biocloud.net">www.biocloud.net</ext-link>). The microbial classification was performed using the SILVA138 and hierarchical clustering algorithms. The OTUs were determined by clustering the sequences with 97% similarity and were classified into different taxonomic ranks. The relative abundance of each bacterial species was visualized using R software.

<p>The manuscript by Chen et al. investigated the interaction between CHI3L1, a chitinase-like protein in the 18 glycosyl hydrolase family, and gut bacteria in the mucosal layers. The authors provided evidence to document the direct interaction between CHI3L1 and peptidoglycan, a major component of bacterial cell wall. Doing so, Chi3l1 produced by gut epithelial cells regulates the balance of gut microbiome and diminishes DSS-induced colitis, potentially through the colonization of protective gram-positive bacteria such as lactobacillus.</p>
<p>The study is the first to systemically document the interactions between Chi3L1 and microbiome. Convincing data were shown to characterize the imbalance of gram-positive bacteria in the newly generated gut epithelial-specific Chi3L1 deficient mice. Comprehensive FMT experiments were performed to demonstrate the contributions of gut microbiome using the mouse colitis model. The manuscript is strengthened by additional mechanistic studies concerning the binding between Chi3l1 and peptidoglycan, and discussions on existing body of literature demonstrating that detrimental roles of Chi3l1 in mouse IBD model, which conflict with the current study.</p>

<p>Chen et al. investigated the regulatory mechanism of bacterial colonization in the intestinal mucus layer in mice and its implications to intestinal diseases. They demonstrated that Chi3l1 is a protein produced and secreted by intestinal epithelial cells into the mucus layer upon response to the gut microbiota, which has a turnover effect on facilitating the colonization of gram-positive bacteria in the mucosa. The data also indicate that Chi3l1 interacts with the peptidoglycan of the bacteria cell wall, supporting the colonization of beneficial bacteria strains such as Lactobacillus, and that deficiency in Chi3l1 predisposes mice to colitis. The inclusion of a small but pertinent piece of human data added to solidify their findings in mice.</p>
<p>Overall, the experiments were appropriately designed and executed with precision. The revised manuscript represents a significant improvement over the initial version. The inclusion of new, higher-resolution images provides stronger support for the conclusions drawn. Additionally, statistical analyses of the imaging data, as recommended, have been integrated. The authors have effectively addressed the majority of the reviewers' suggestions and criticisms, making this version well-suited for publication.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Public Reviews:</bold></p>
<p><bold>Reviewer 1</bold>:</p>
<p>(1) In Figure 1, it is curious that the authors only chose E.coli and staphytlococcus sciuri to test the induction of Chi3l1. What about other bacteria? Why does only E.coli but not staphytlococcus sciuri induce chi3l1 production? It does not prove that the gut microbiome induces the expression of Chi3l1. If it is the effect of LPS, does it trigger a cell death response or inflammatory responses that are known to induce chi3l1 production? What is the role of peptidoglycan in this experiment? Also, it is recommended to change WT to SPF in the figure and text, as no genetic manipulation was involved in this figure.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your valuable feedback and insightful suggestions. In our study, we tried to identify bacteria from murine gut contents and feces using 16S sequencing. However, only <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>Staphylococcus sciuri</italic> were identified (Figure 1D). Consequently, our experiments were limited to these two bacterial strains. While we have not tested other bacteria, our data suggest that not all bacteria can induce the expression of Chi3l1. Given that <italic>E. coli</italic> is Gram-negative and <italic>Staphylococcus sciuri</italic> is Gram-positive, we hypothesized that the difference in their ability to induce Chi3l1 expression might be due to variations between Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, such as the presence of lipopolysaccharides (LPS).</p>
<p>To test this hypothesis, we used LPS to induce Chi3l1 expression. Consistent with our hypothesis, LPS successfully induced Chi3l1 expression (Figure 1F&amp;G). Additionally, we observed that Chi3l1 expression is significantly upregulated in specific pathogen-free (SPF) mice compared to germ-free mice (Figure 1A), demonstrating that the gut microbiome induces the expression of Chi3l1.</p>
<p>Although we have not examined cell death or inflammatory responses, the protective role of Chi3l1 shown in Figure 5 suggests that any such responses would be mild and negligible. Regarding the role of peptidoglycan in the induction of Chi3l1 expression in DLD-1 cells, we have not yet explored this aspect. However, we agree with your suggestion that it would be worthwhile to investigate this in future experiments.</p>
<p>We have also made the suggested modifications to the labeling (Figure 1A) and the clarification in the revised manuscript accordingly (page 3, Line 95-96; Line 102-106).</p>
<p>Thank you again for your constructive feedback.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) In Figure 2, the binding between Chi3l1 and PGN needs better characterization, regarding the affinity and how it compares with the binding between Chi3l1 and chitin. More importantly, it is unclear how this interaction could facilitate the colonization of gram-positive bacteria.</p>

<p>Thank you for your insightful suggestions and we have performed the suggested experiments and included the results in the revised manuscript (Figure 2E-G, page 3-4, Line 132-146).</p>
<p>Our results indicate that Chi3l1 interact with PGN in a dose-increase manner (Figure 2E). In contrast, the binding between Chi3l1 and chitin did not exhibit dose dependency (Figure 2E). These findings suggest a specific and distinct binding mechanism for Chi3l1 with PGN compared to chitin.</p>
<p>We conducted DLD-1 cell-bacteria adhesion experiments, using GlmM mutant (PGN synthesis mutant) and K12 (wild-type) bacteria to test their adhesion capabilities. The results showed that the adhesion ability of the GlmM mutant to cells significantly decreased (Figure 2F). Additionally, after knocking down Chi3l1 in DLD-1 cells, we observed a decreased bacterial adhesion (Figure 2G). These findings suggest that Chi3l1 and PGN interaction plays a crucial role in bacterial adhesion.</p>

<p>(5) In Figure 5, the fact that FMT did not completely rescue the phenotype may point to the role of host cells in the processes. The reason that lactobacillus transfer did completely rescue the phenotypes could be due to the overwhelming protective role of lactobacillus itself, as the experiments were missing villin-cre mice transferred with lactobacillus.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your valuable feedback and thorough review. In our study, pretreatment with antibiotics in mice to eliminate gut microbiota demonstrated that IEC∆Chil1 mice exhibited a milder colitis phenotype (Supplementary Figure 4). This suggests that Chi3l1-expressing host cells are likely to play a detrimental role in colitis. Consequently, the failure of FMT to completely rescue the phenotype is likely due to the incomplete preservation of bacteria in the feces during the transfer experiment.</p>
<p>We agree with your assessment of the protective role of <italic>lactobacillus</italic>. This also explains the significant difference in colitis phenotype between Villin-cre and IEC∆Chil1 mice (Figure 5B-E), as <italic>lactobacillus</italic> levels are significantly lower in IEC∆Chil1 mice (Figure 4F). Given the severity of colitis in Villin-cre mice at 7 days post-DSS, even if <italic>lactobacillus</italic> were transferred back to these mice, it is unlikely to result in a significant improvement.</p>

<p>Thank you for your insightful suggestions and we have performed the suggested statistical analysis on most of the figures and included the analysis in the revised manuscript (Figure 1A, Figure 3E&amp;F, Supplementary Figure 3B&amp;C).Given large quantity of dietary fiber intertwined with bacteria, it is challenging to make a reliable quantification of bacteria in Figure 4G.

<p>(2) In the fecal/Lactobacillus transplantation experiments, oral gavage of Lactobacillus to IECChil1 mice ameliorated the colitis phenotype, by preventing colon length reduction, weight loss, and colon inflammation. These findings seem to go against the notion that Chi3l1 is necessary for the colonization of Lactobacillus in the intestinal mucosa. The authors could speculate on how Lactobacillus administration is still beneficial in the absence of Chi3l1. Perhaps, additional data showing the localization of the orally administered bacteria in the gut of Chi3l1 deficient mice would clarify whether Lactobacillus are more successfully colonizing other regions of the gut, but not the mucus layer. Alternatively, later time points of 2% DSS challenge, after Lactobacillus transplantation, would suggest whether the gut colonization by Lactobacillus and therefore the milder colitis phenotype, is sustained for longer periods in the absence of Chi3l1.</p>

<p>Thank you for your thorough review and insightful suggestions. Since we pretreated mice with antibiotics, the intestinal mucus layer is likely damaged according to a previous study (PMID: 37097253).

<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>The claim that mucus-associated Ch3l1 controls colonization of beneficial Gram-positive species within the mucus is not conclusive. The study should take into account recent discoveries on the nature of mucus in the colon, namely its mobile fecal association and complex structure based on two distinct mucus barrier layers coming from proximal and distal parts of the colon (PMID: ). This impacts the interpretation of how and where Ch3l1 is expressed and gets into the mucus to promote colonization. It also impacts their conclusions because the authors compare fecal vs. tissue mucus, but most of the mucus would be attached to the feces. Of the mucus that was claimed to be isolated from the WT and IEC Ch3l1 KO, this was not biochemically verified. Such verification (e.g. through Western blot) would increase confidence in the data presented. Further, the study relies upon relative microbial profiling, which can mask absolute numbers, making the claim of reduced overall Gram-positive species in mice lacking Ch3l1 unproven. It would be beneficial to show more quantitative approaches (e.g. Quantitative Microbial Profiling, QMP) to provide more definitive conclusions on the impact of Ch3l1 loss on Gram+ microbes.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>You raise an excellent point about the data interpretation, and we appreciate your insightful suggestions. We have included the discussion regarding the recent discoveries in the revised manuscript (page 7-8, Line 304-312). According to the recent discovery, the mucus in the proximal colon forms a primary encapsulation barrier around fecal material, while the mucus in the distal colon forms a secondary barrier. Our findings indicate that Chi3l1 is expressed throughout the entire colon, including the proximal, middle, and distal sections (See Author response image 1 below, P.S. Chi3l1 detection in colon presented in the manuscript are from the middle section). This suggests that Chi3l1 likely promotes bacterial colonization across the entire colon. Despite most mucus being expelled with feces, the</p>
<p>constant production of mucus and the minimal presence of Chi3l1 in feces (Figure 4C) indicate that Chi3l1 continuously plays a role in promoting the colonization of microbiota.</p>

<p>Due to a lack of expertise, it has been challenging for us to perform reliable QMP experiments.

Therefore, our data is reliable to some extent.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Other weaknesses lie in the execution of the aims, leaving many claims incompletely substantiated. For example, much of the imaging data is challenging for the reader to interpret due to it being unfocused, too low of magnification, not including the correct control, and not comparing the same regions of tissues among different in vivo study groups. Statistical rigor could be better demonstrated, particularly when making claims based on imaging data. These are often presented as single images without any statistics (i.e. analysis of multiple images and biological replicates).
