<title>Abstract</title>
<p>DYRK1A, a ubiquitously expressed kinase, is linked to the dominant intellectual developmental disorder, microcephaly and Down syndrome in humans. It regulates numerous cellular processes such cell cycle, vesicle trafficking and microtubule assembly. DYRK1A is a critical regulator of organ growth, however, how it regulates organ growth is not fully understood. Here we show that knockdown of <italic>DYRK1A</italic> results in reduced cell size, which is dependent on mTORC1. Using proteomic approaches, we found that DYRK1A interacts with the Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) proteins, namely TSC1 and TSC2, which negatively regulate mTORC1 activation. Further, we show that DYRK1A phosphorylates TSC2 at T1462, a modification that is known to inhibit TSC activity and promote mTORC1 activity. We also found that the reduced cell growth upon knockdown of DYRK1A can be rescued by overexpression of RHEB, an activator of mTORC1. Our findings suggest that DYRK1A inhibits TSC complex activity through an inhibitory phosphorylation on TSC2 and thereby promotes mTORC1 activity. Further, using <italic>Drosophila</italic> neuromuscular junction as model, we show that the <italic>mnb</italic>, the fly homologues of <italic>DYRK1A</italic>, is rescued by RHEB overexpression suggesting a conserved role of <italic>DYRK1A</italic> in TORC1 regulation.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The <italic>Dual-Specificity Tyrosine Phosphorylation-Regulated Kinase 1A (DYRK1A)</italic> is a ubiquitously expressed kinase that belongs to the CMGC group (<underline>C</underline>yclin-dependent kinases, <underline>M</underline>itogen-activated protein kinase, <underline>G</underline>lycogen synthase kinases and <underline>C</underline>DK-like kinases group). <italic>DYRK1A</italic>, is located within the Down syndrome Critical Region (DSCR). The phenotypes associated with Down syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>), including abnormal neurodevelopment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>), and increased susceptibility to acute megakaryoblastic leukemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>), has been reasoned to be due to an increased expression of <italic>DYRK1A</italic>. On the other hand, haploinsufficiency of <italic>DYRK1A</italic> causes DYRK1A syndrome, a rare autosomal dominant disease, characterized by intellectual disability, intrauterine growth retardation, microcephaly and stunted growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>). Mouse models heterozygous for <italic>Dyrk1a</italic> also show a reduction in brain and body size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>). In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, loss of <italic>mnb</italic>, the <italic>Drosophila</italic> homolog of DYRK1A, results in reduced organ size including brain, legs and wings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>). Therefore, <italic>DYRK1A</italic> is a critical regulator of organ growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>); however, the cellular processes by which <italic>DYRK1A</italic> promote organ growth are not clear.</p>
<p><italic>DYRK1A</italic> and its homologs have also been implicated in a large number of cellular processes such as cell cycle, signal transduction, gene expression, vesicle trafficking and microtubule assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>). DYRK1A has been shown to extend G1 phase of the cell cycle in neuroblastoma cells by phosphorylation and subsequent, degradation of cyclin D1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>). In glioblastoma cells, DYRK1A phosphorylates ubiquitin ligase CDC23, which mediates mitotic protein degradation, thereby, promotes tumor growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>). Further, DYRK1A expression positively correlates with EGFR levels, and DYRK1A inhibitors reduce EGFR-dependent glioblastoma cells growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>). DYRK1A promotes the expression of several genes required for ribosomal biogenesis and protein translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>), for example, RPS6 ribosomal protein S6, a component of the 40S subunit, and translation initiation factor, EIF4A3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>). However, if the regulation of these genes by DYRK1A is physiologically significant is currently unknown.</p>
<p>Mechanistic Target of Rapamycin Complex 1 (mTORC1) is a key energy sensor and a master regulator of anabolic processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>). The mTORC1 promotes anabolic processes such as protein, nucleotide and lipid synthesis and represses catabolic processes such as autophagy, thereby promoting cellular growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>). The mechanism of mTORC1-mediated regulation of multiple anabolic pathways has been studied extensively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>). The Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC), consisting of TSC1, TSC2 and TBC1D7 (TBC1 domain family member 7), integrates various extracellular signals and negatively regulates mTORC1 complex activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>). TSC2 is a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) and promotes the conversion of GTP-bound RHEB (Ras Homolog Enriched in Brain) to the GDP-bound state, thereby inhibiting it. When TSC2 is inhibited, the GTP-bound RHEB activates mTORC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>). The mTORC1 activation is controlled by extracellular stimuli, nutrients, energy status, and stress. For example, in response to insulin stimulation, AKT phosphorylates TSC2 at several sites including S939 and T1462 and suppresses its inhibitory effect on RHEB-GTP recycling, thus activating mTORC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>). Similarly, in response to growth factors, Extracellular signal-Regulated Kinase (ERK) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>) and p90 Ribosomal S6 Kinase 1 (RSK1) phosphorylate TSC2 and activate mTORC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>). MK2 (MAP kinase-activated protein kinase 2/ MAPKAPK2) phosphorylates TSC2 at yet another site S1210 in the presence of serum, and leads to the inhibition of TSC2 activity, which allows the activation of mTORC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>). Catabolic signals, such as low energy levels during glucose scarcity drive AMPK-mediated phosphorylation of TSC2 that promotes its GAP function and suppresses mTORC1 activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>). A large number of kinases regulating the TSC activity underscores the importance of investigating novel kinases involved in its regulation which may regulate mTORC1 activity in distinct cellular contexts.</p>
<p>In this study, we discover that DYRK1A interacts with TSC1 and TSC2. We show that DYRK1A phosphorylates TSC2 at T1462 and, therefore, is a possible positive regulator of mTORC1 activity and cell growth. Further we show that in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, both Mnb, the DYRK1A-homolog, and mTORC1 are required to promote Neuromuscular Junction (NMJ) growth. Moreover, the activation of mTORC1 can rescue NMJ growth phenotype of <italic>mnb</italic> loss of function suggesting Mnb may regulates mTORC1 to promotes neuromuscular junction morphology. Therefore, we propose that DYRK1A-mediated regulation of mTORC1 activity is a conserved mechanism to regulate cell size and development.</p>

<title>DYRK1A promotes cell growth</title>
<p>To study the function of <italic>DYRK1A</italic>, we have performed knockdown of DYRK1A in multiple cell lines, including in HEK293 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>). We noticed that DYRK1A depleted cells were smaller in size compared to the control cells. To explore if DYRK1A has a role in maintaining cell size, we performed systematic analysis of the cell size phenotypes after transient knockdown of <italic>DYRK1A</italic> in HEK293 and observed a reduction in cell size (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A-B</xref></bold>). Since mutations in <italic>DYRK1A</italic> are associated with both stunted growth as well as microcephaly, we wondered if neuronal cells require DYRK1A for maintaining proper cell size. Therefore, we knocked down <italic>DYRK1A</italic> in human neuroblastoma cell line SH-SY5Y and observed significant reduction in cell size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1 C-D</xref>). Further, we tested if the observed cell size phenotype is conserved in mouse. We targeted <italic>Dyrk1a</italic> in NIH-3T3 using CRISPR/Cas9 and observed a significant reduction in cell size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E-F</xref>). Our data suggests that <italic>DYRK1A</italic> promotes cell size across cell lines derived from different models and tissues. Thus, we tested if the overexpression of DYRK1A can promote cell size. Since strong overexpression of <italic>DYRK1A</italic> leads to cell cycle exit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>), we used the Doxycycline-inducible system to express low levels of <italic>Flag-DYRK1A</italic> in HEK293 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>). We noted a change in cell size with increasing dosage of Doxycycline that reached saturation state at 100ng/ml Doxycycline in our system (<bold>Supplementary figure 1</bold>). We observed a significant increase in cell size at 40 ng/ml Doxycycline treatment for 48 hours, when the <italic>DYRK1A</italic> mRNA levels were approximately twice that of control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G-H</xref>). Overall, our knockdown and overexpression experiments in different cell lines, including both human and mouse suggest that <italic>DYRK1A</italic> promotes cell size.</p>

<title>DYRK1A physically interacts with the Tuberous Sclerosis Complex</title>
<p>To understand how <italic>DYRK1A</italic> promotes cell growth, we investigated DYRK1A protein-interactors. Previously, we have identified protein-interactors of wild-type and kinase-dead DYRK1A (K188R) from HEK293 cells using affinity purification and mass spectrometry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>). In these purifications, we have observed significant enrichment of DCAF7, ARIP4, RB1, EP300, CREBBP, TRAF2, TRAF3, FAM53C, RNF169, many of which have also been identified by many other groups as bona-fide DYRK1A interacting proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>). We also observed significant enrichment of TSC components TSC1 and TSC2 among proteins co-purified with wild-type as well as kinase-dead DYRK1A (K188R) (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref></bold>). Interestingly, a few peptides of TBC1D7, the third component of TSC were also detected in the wild-type pull-down (see dNSAF values in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2 A</xref>), suggesting that DYRK1A interacts with the TSC complex. This interaction is intriguing as TSC is a negative regulator of the mTORC1, which is known to promote cell growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>).</p>

<p><bold>(A)</bold> The MS/MS datasets previously acquired by MudPIT analyses of FLAG-DYRK1A affinity purifications and negative FLAG controls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>) were searched against the most recent releases of the human protein sequence databases (built by collating and removing redundant entries from NCBI <italic>Homo sapiens</italic> RefSeq <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/refseq/vertebrate_mammalian/Homo_sapiens/latest_assembly_versions/GCF_000001405.40_GRCh38.p14/">GCF_000001405.40_GRCh38.p14</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/refseq/vertebrate_mammalian/Homo_sapiens/latest_assembly_versions/GCF_009914755.1_T2T-CHM13v2.0/">GCF_009914755.1_T2T-CHM13v2.0</ext-link>). Highly enriched proteins include known and novel DYRK1A-interacting partners and are reported with their peptide counts and distributed Normalized Spectral Abundance Factor (dNSAF) values, which reflect their relative abundance in the samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>). <bold>(B)</bold> Flag beads were used to pull-down Flag-DYRK1A from whole cell extracts of HEK293 transfected with Flag-DYRK1A, Protein A beads were used as a control.

<p>To ascertain the interaction between DYRK1A and TSC, we expressed <italic>Flag-DYRK1A</italic> in HEK293 cells through the Doxycycline-inducible system and performed Flag affinity purification. Surprisingly, when we used HEPES buffer containing either 0.5% NP40 or 1% Tween 20, we did not detect co-purification of TSC2 with Flag-DYRK1A (data not shown). However, when we prepared extracts by lysing the cells in hypotonic buffer without detergent followed by Dounce homogenization, we found that both, TSC1 and TSC2 co-purify with Flag-DYRK1A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Further, we tested the interaction between endogenous DYRK1A and TSC by immunoprecipitating DYKR1A; we observed co-purification of both TSC1 and TSC2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). These results confirmed that DYRK1A physically interacts with the TSC complex. We then sought to identify the domains of DYRK1A that interact with TSC1 as TSC1 is the scaffolding protein in the TSC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>). We co-overexpressed HA3-TSC1 and various truncated forms of Flag-DYRK1A in HEK293 cells (<bold>Supplementary Figure 2</bold>). We found that interaction between DYRK1A and TSC1 was abolished in all the truncated forms that lack DYRK1A kinase domain, which suggests that DYRK1A kinase domain is required for the interaction (<bold>Supplementary Figure 2</bold>). We further confirmed that DYRK1A interacts with TSC1 through its kinase domain by co-expressing the FLAG tagged DYRK1A kinase domain and HA3-TSC1, followed by immunoprecipitation using anti FLAG antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Taken together, our results show that DYRK1A physically interacts with the TSC.</p>

<title>DYRK1A promotes mTORC1 activity</title>
<p>Next, we sought to test the implications of TSC and DYRK1A interaction on mTORC1 activity. mTORC1 is known to be induced in HEK293 cells by treatment with fetal bovine serum (FBS), insulin, and many growth factors following the serum starvation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>). We performed similar experiments, where we knocked down <italic>DYRK1A</italic> followed by serum starvation and tested for levels of pS6K, a reporter for mTOR activity. We did not observe a significant reduction in basal phosphorylation levels on S6K and S6. However, 10 and 20 min after FBS treatment we observed significantly reduced levels of Phospho-S6K and Phospho-S6 in <italic>DYRK1A</italic> KD as compared to control HEK293 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A-C</xref>). Further, we tested the levels of pS6K and pS6 in NIH3T3 after CRISPR-mediated targeting of <italic>Dyrk1a</italic>. Interestingly, we found significant reductions in both pS6K and pS6 as compared to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3 D-F</xref>).

<title>DYRK1A phosphorylates TSC2 at T1462</title>
<p>Next, we investigated if DYRK1A phosphorylates TSC1/TSC2, which is known to regulate mTORC1 activity. For this, we first knocked down <italic>DYRK1A</italic> in HEK293 cells, co-expressed <italic>HA3-TSC1</italic> and <italic>Flag-TSC2</italic> and performed immunoprecipitation followed by LC/tandem MS (MS/MS) to identify phosphorylation status of TSC1 and TSC2 in these cells. We observed that <italic>DYRK1A</italic> knockdown samples have reduced TSC2 phosphorylation at T1462 (T1462) compare to the control samples. T1462 has been previously identified as a site phosphorylated by various kinases that activate the mTORC1 pathway, including AKT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>), ERK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase 1 (RSK1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>), IκB kinase β (IKKβ) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>), and MAPKAPK2 (MK2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>) in response to insulin and other growth factors. To ascertain that indeed TSC2 T1462 is the site phosphorylated by DYRK1A, we performed <italic>in-vitro</italic> kinase assays using purified wild-type and kinase-dead DYRK1A. As TSC2 is about 200KDa protein, we purified transiently overexpressed HA3-TSC1 and Flag-TSC2 from HEK293 cells and performed <italic>in vitro</italic> kinase assay on beads. Wild-type DYRK1A autophosphorylates and runs as fuzzy bands around 90-100Kda in polyacrylamide gels, whereas kinase-dead DYRK1A runs only as a single sharp band (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). In our assay, we did not observe an increase in phosphorylation at S1387 or at Serine 939 in presence of ATP and DYRK1A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). However, immunopurified TSC2 is heavily phosphorylated at Serine 1387 and Serine 939, two important sites, phosphorylated by AKT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>). Therefore, we cannot rule out if the immunopurified TSC2 was fully phosphorylated at S1387 and at S939. However, it is important to note that we did not observe any differential loss of phosphorylation in TSC2 at S1387 in our mass spectrometry phosphorylation analysis. Interestingly, we found T1462 was strongly phosphorylated by wild-type DYRK1A, and not by kinase-dead DYRK1A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Taken together, these experiments demonstrate that DYRK1A phosphorylates TSC2 on T1462. This phosphorylation is known to be an inhibitory modification and it is a key site that gets phosphorylated by various other key regulators of the mTORC1 pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>). We were not able to perform in-vitro tests to check if DYRK1A phosphorylates TSC1 or other sites on TSC2 due to the lack of appropriate antibodies. The overall data suggest that DYRK1A mediates TSC2 T1462 phosphorylation to inhibit TSC activity and, therefore, promotes TORC1 activity.</p>

<title>RHEB overexpression can rescue cell growth phenotype of <italic>DYRK1A</italic> knockdown</title>
<p>TSC phosphorylation has been shown to inhibit TSC, and activate mTORC1 via RHEB, where, the activation of TSC leads to the hydrolysis of GTP-bound RHEB, which in turn leads to mTORC1 inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>). We hypothesized that DYRK1A-mediated phosphorylation of TSC2 may promote mTORC1 activation in a RHEB-mediated manner. Therefore, we reasoned that overexpression of <italic>RHEB</italic>, will result in the rescue of cell size phenotype caused by <italic>DYRK1A</italic> knockdown. We overexpressed <italic>RHEB</italic> in <italic>DYRK1A</italic> knockdown cells and found a partial rescue of cell size, suggesting that DYRK1A indeed plays a role in cell size regulation at least partly upstream to RHEB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">C</xref>). Taken together these data suggest that DYRK1A phosphorylates TSC2, which inhibits its action, leading to the activation of mTORC1 via RHEB.</p>

<title><italic>Drosophila mnb</italic> mutants show reduced neuromuscular junctions, which can be rescued by RHEB overexpression</title>
<p>Since the TSC-TOR pathway is conserved in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>), we sought to test if the DYRK1A-mediated regulation of the TSC-TOR pathway is also conserved. The TOR pathway is shown to promote neuromuscular junction (NMJ) development in flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B,G</xref>). Similarly, <italic>mnb</italic>, the fly homolog of DYRK1A, is also required for NMJ growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>); however, the mechanism of <italic>mnb</italic>-mediated NMJ growth is not known. Based on our finding that <italic>DYRK1A</italic> promotes TOR activity, we hypothesized that <italic>mnb</italic> promotes larval NMJ growth through TOR. To test this hypothesis, we systematically compared the NMJ growth phenotype of <italic>mnb</italic> mutant with that of loss or gain of TOR activity at larval NMJ. Since TOR mutants are early larval lethal, we expressed dominant-negative TOR (<italic>TOR.Ted</italic>) in motor neurons using the UAS-Gal4 system (<italic>D42Gal4&gt;UAS-TOR.Ted)</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>). To activate the TOR pathway, we overexpressed <italic>RHEB</italic> in motor neurons (<italic>D42Gal4&gt;UAS-RHEB</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>). We stained NMJ using anti-HRP (to mark neurons) and anti-DLG (to mark boutons where synaptic connections are formed). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5 (A, B, G)</xref>, the loss of <italic>mnb</italic> causes a reduction in the NMJ bouton numbers compared to the Wild-type control (WT, Canton S). Similarly, the expression of TOR.TED in motor neurons (<italic>D42Gal4&gt;UAS-Tor.Ted</italic>) also causes a reduction in NMJ bouton numbers (Supplementary Figure S3 D-F). In contrast, overexpression of <italic>mnb</italic> in motor neurons increases the bouton numbers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4 C, D, H</xref>). Similarly, the activation of the TOR pathway by overexpression of <italic>RHEB</italic> in motor neurons or mutations in <italic>gigas</italic> (<italic>gig</italic>, the fly homolog of <italic>TSC2</italic>) increases the number of boutons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig 5 E, F, I</xref>, Supplementary Figure S3 C). The similarities in the TOR and <italic>mnb</italic> phenotypes suggests that Mnb may positively regulate TOR activity and promote NMJ growth. To test this hypothesis, we asked whether or not the NMJ phenotype of the <italic>mnb</italic> mutant is rescued by the activation of TOR. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">figure 5L</xref>, overexpression of <italic>RHEB</italic> rescues the NMJ bouton numbers in <italic>mnb</italic> mutants. These results indicate that <italic>RHEB</italic> functions downstream to <italic>mnb</italic> to regulate the NMJ development. Taken together, the results in mammalian cells and in flies suggest that the role of DYRK1A/Mnb in the regulation of the TOR pathway is conserved.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this work, we show that DYRK1A promotes cell size as a reduction in <italic>DYRK1A</italic> levels in both, human and mouse cells, result in small cell size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A-D</xref>). mTORC1 has been shown to be is a key energy sensor and a master regulator of cell growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>). We found that reduced levels of <italic>DYRK1A</italic> in cells results in decreased S6K and S6 phosphorylation suggesting that DYRK1A positively regulates mTORC1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). One of the key regulators of mTORC1 is the TSC complex, consisting of TSC1, TSC2 and TBC1D7 (TBC1 domain family member 7), which integrates various extracellular signals and negatively regulates mTORC1 complex activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>). We found that DYRK1A physically interacts with TSC complex through its kinase domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). TSC2 is a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) that promotes the conversion of GTP-bound RHEB to the GDP-bound state, thereby inhibiting it. When TSC2 is inhibited, the GTP-bound RHEB activates mTORC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>). Phosphorylation at TSC2 at T1462 has been shown to inhibit TSC and promotes TORC1 activity through RHEB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>). Our study, for the first time, shows that DYRK1A phosphorylates TSC2 at T1462 site, thereby, promotes the mTORC1 pathway. We also show that the overexpression of <italic>RHEB</italic> could partially rescue the cell growth phenotypes exhibited by <italic>DYRK1A</italic> knockdown cells, indicating that the DYRK1A works upstream to RHEB.</p>
<p>In DYRK1A syndrome, loss of one copy of <italic>DYRK1A l</italic>eads to stunted growth and microcephaly in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>). A recent report showing reduction in mTOR signaling in mice cortex lacking <italic>Dyrk1a</italic> indicates that the DYRK1A-mTORC1 axis may indeed regulate brain development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>). In <italic>Drosophila, mnb</italic> is widely expressed in the developing central nervous system and has been linked to post-differentiation roles in neurons. For example, in flies, <italic>mnb</italic> has been linked to long-term memory formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>). In humans and mice, <italic>DYRK1A</italic> has been linked to the neurite spine morphogenesis and it has been suggested that the neurite spine phenotype may contribute to intellectual disability in Down syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>). The phenomenon of NMJ morphogenesis in fruit flies is analogous to the neurite spine morphogenesis. The TOR pathway is shown to promote neuromuscular junction (NMJ) development in flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B,G</xref>). Similarly, <italic>mnb</italic> is also required for NMJ growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>); however, the mechanism of <italic>mnb</italic>-mediated NMJ growth was not known. Our results show that the reduction in NMJ size in <italic>mnb</italic> mutants can be rescued by <italic>RHEB</italic> overexpression, suggesting that Mnb positively regulates mTORC1. Overall, our results suggest that the role of Mnb/DYRK1A in the regulation of mTORC1 pathway is evolutionarily conserved, and the DYRK1A-mTORC1 axis plays a crucial role in neuronal morphogenesis and cellular growth.</p>

The pellet was subsequently dissolved with 8 M urea in 100 mM Tris-Cl (pH 8.5). TCEP (final concentration is 5 mM; Thermo Scientific) and Iodoacetamide (final concentration is 10mM; Sigma) were added to the solution and incubated at room temperature for 20 and 15 minutes for reduction and alkylation respectively. The solution was diluted four times and digested with Trypsin at 1:50 (w/w; Promega).</p>
<p>LC/tandem MS (MS/MS) analysis of peptide: The peptide mixture was loaded on a home-made 15 cm-long pulled-tip analytical column (75 μm i.d.) packed with 3μm reverse-phase beads (Aqua C18, Phenomenex, Torrance, CA) connected to an Easy-nLC 1000 nano HPLC (Thermo Scientific, San Jose, CA) for mass spectrometry analysis. Data-dependent tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) analysis was performed with a Q Exactive Orbitrap mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific, San Jose, CA). Peptides eluted from the LC system were directly electrosprayed into the mass spectrometer with a distal 1.8-kV spray voltage. One acquisition cycle includes one full-scan MS spectrum (m/z 300-1800) followed by top 20 MS/MS events, sequentially generated on the first to the twentieth most intense ions selected from the full MS spectrum at a 27% normalized collision energy. MS scan functions and LC solvent gradients were controlled by the Xcalibur data system (Thermo Scientific).</p>

<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>The acquired MS/MS data were analyzed against a UniProtKB <italic>Homo sapiens</italic> database using Integrated Proteomics Pipeline (IP2, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://integratedproteomics.com/">http://integratedproteomics.com/</ext-link>). In order to accurately estimate peptide probabilities and false discovery rates, we used a decoy database containing the reversed sequences of all the proteins appended to the target database. Carbamidomethylation (+57.02146) of cysteine was considered as a static modification and lysine phosphorylation (+79.9663) of STY as a variable modification.</p>

<title>Flag Immunoprecipitation</title>
<p>With detergent: 1×10<sup>6</sup> cells were seeded in 10 cm plates. After 24 hours of culture, cells were co-transfected with 5μg pcDNA-<italic>Flag-DYRK1A</italic>/deletion and 5μg <italic>HA-TSC1</italic> using PEI. After 48h, collected cells were washed once with cold PBS, and lysed in cold NP-40 lysis buffer (40mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 120mM NaCl, 1mM EDTA, 1% NP-40 [Igepal CA-630], 5% glycerol, 10 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 10 mM glycerol 2-phosphate, 50 mM NaF, 0.5 mM sodium orthovanadate and 1:100 protease inhibitors [Solarbio, P6730]) for 15 min on ice. Lysates were cleared by centrifugation and protein concentration was measured using BCA kit. Supernatant was then incubated with Flag beads (Smart-Lifesciences, SA042005) for ~4 h at 4°C. Finally, beads were washed with a lysis buffer without NP-40 three times and resuspended in a 1× SDS loading buffer. Samples were heated for 10 min at 95°C and separated by SDS-PAGE.</p>

<p>This <bold>important</bold> study describes a combination of in vitro and in vivo results implicating Dyrk1a in the regulation of mTOR. Strengths include the combination of cell and whole-animal (Drosophila) based studies. However, the evidence supporting the conclusions is <bold>incomplete</bold> and additional experimentation (which could include IPs, more confirmation of the T1462 phosphorylation, and more information about Akt) would strengthen the main conclusions.</p>

<p>In this manuscript, Wang et al. demonstrate that knockdown of DYRK1A results in reduced cell size, which is mediated by mTORC1 activity. They found that DYRK1A interacts with TSC1/TSC2 proteins which leads to the phosphorylation of TSC2 at T1462. Phosphorylation of TSC2 at T1462 inhibits TSC2 activity leading to the activation of mTORC1. The authors complement their findings by demonstrating that overexpression of RHEB (positive regulator of mTORC1) rescues the phenotype of DYRK1A (mnb in flies) mutation in the NMJ.</p>
<p>The authors' findings on the regulation of cell size and mTORC1 activity by DYRK1A reflect the previous findings of Levy et al. (PMID: 33840455) that cortical deletion of Dyrk1a in mice causes decreased neuronal size associated with a decreased activity of mTORC1 that can be rescued by the inhibition of Pten or supplementation of IGF1.</p>
<p>The authors demonstrate that T1462 phospho-site at TSC2 is phosphorylated in response to the overexpression of WT but not kinase-dead DYRK1A. However, the authors do not provide any evidence that the regulation of mTORC1 is mediated via phosphorylation of this site. In addition, T1462 site is known to be phosphorylated by Akt. There is a possibility that Akt was co-purified with TSC1/TSC2 complex and DYRK1A promotes phosphorylation of TSC2 indirectly via the activation of AKT that can be tested by using AKT depleted cells.</p>
<p>RHEB is the most proximal regulator of mTORC1 and can activate mTORC1 even under amino acid starvation. The fact that RHEB overexpression rescues the cell size under DYRK1A depletion or mnb (DYRK1A in Drosophila) mutant phenotype does not prove that DYRK1A regulates the cell size via TSC1 as it would rescue any inhibitory effects upstream to mTORC1.</p>

<p>This study aims to describe a physical interaction between the kinase DYRK1A and the Tuberous Sclerosis Complex proteins (TSC1, TSC2, TBC1D7). Furthermore, this study aims to demonstrate that DYRK1A, upon interaction with the TSC proteins regulates mTORC1 activity and cell size. Additionally, this study identifies T1462 on TSC2 as a phosphorylation target of DYRK1A. Finally, the authors demonstrate the role of DYRK1A on cell size using human, mouse, and Drosophila cells.</p>
<p>This study, as it stands, requires further experimentation to support the conclusions on the role of DYRK1A on TSC interaction and subsequently on mTORC1 regulation. Weaknesses include, 1) The lack of an additional assessment of cell growth/size (eg. protein content, proliferation), 2) the limited data on the requirement of DYRK1A for TSC complex stability and function, and 3) the limited perturbations on the mTORC1 pathway upon DYRK1A deletion/overexpression. Finally, this study would benefit from identifying under which nutrient conditions DYRK1A interacts with the TS complex to regulate mTORC1.</p>
<p>The interaction described here is highly impactful to the field of mTORC1-regulated cell growth and uncovers a previously unrecognized TSC-associated interacting protein. Further characterization of the role that DYRK1A plays in regulating mTORC1 activation and the upstream signals that stimulate this interaction will be extremely important for multiple diseases that exhibit mTORC1 hyper-activation.</p>

<p>The manuscript describes a combination of in vitro and in vivo results implicating Dyrk1a in the regulation of mTORC. Particular strengths of the data are this combination of cell and whole animal (drosophila) based studies. However, most of the experiments seem to lack a key additional experimental condition that could increase confidence in the authors' conclusions. Overall some tantalizing data is presented. However, there are several issues that should be clarified or otherwise addressed with additional data.</p>
<p>1. In Figure 1G, why not test overexpression levels of Dyrk1a via western rather than only looking at the RNA levels?</p>
<p>2. In Figure 2, while there is clearly TSC1 protein in the Dyrk1a and FLAG-Dyrk1a IPs that supports an interaction between the proteins, it would be good to see the reciprocal IP experiment wherein TSC1 or TSC2 are pulled down and then the blot probed for Dyrk1a.</p>
<p>3. Figures 3 A and D tested the effects of Dyrk1a knockdown using different methods in different cell lines. This is a reasonable approach to ascertain the generalizability of findings. However, each experiment is performed differently. For example, in 3A, the authors found no difference in baseline pS6, so they did a time course of treatment to induce phosphorylation and found differences depending on Dyrk1a expression. In 3D, they only show baseline effects from the CRISPr knockdown. Why not do the time course as well for consistency? Also, why the inconsistency in approaches wherein one shows baseline effects and the other does not? The authors could also consider the pharmacologic inhibition of Dyrk1a activity as well.</p>
<p>4. In Figure 4, RHEB overexpression increases cell size in both Dyrk1a wt and Dyrk1a shRNA treated cells, although the magnitude of the effect appears reduced in Dyrk1a shRNA cells. However, there is the possibility here that RHEB acts independently of Dyrk1a. Why not also do the experiment of Figure 1 wherein Dyrk1a is overexpressed and then knockdown RHEB in that context? If the hypothesis is supported, then RHEB knockdown should eliminate the cell size effect of Dyrk1a overexpression.</p>
<p>5. The discussion should incorporate relevant findings from other models, such as Arabidopsis. Barrada et al., Development (2019), 146 (3).</p>
