<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Oocyte meiotic divisions represent a critical process in sexual reproduction, as a diploid non-dividing oocyte is transformed into a haploid fertilizable egg, as a prelude for the subsequent embryonic divisions and differentiation. Although cell differentiation and proliferation are governed by transcription, oocyte maturation and early embryonic divisions depend entirely on changes in protein abundance and post- translational modifications. Here, we analyze the abundance and phosphorylation of proteins during <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocyte meiotic maturation. We reveal significant shifts in protein stability, related to spindle assembly, DNA replication and RNA-binding. Our analysis pinpoints broad changes in phosphorylation correlating with key cytological meiotic milestones, noteworthy changes in membrane trafficking, nuclear envelope disassembly and modifications in microtubule dynamics. Additionally, specific phosphorylation events target regulators of protein translation, Cdk1 and the Mos/MAPK pathway, thereby providing insight into the dynamics of Cdk1 activity, as related to the meiotic cell cycle. This study sheds light on the orchestration of protein dynamics and phosphorylation events during oocyte meiotic divisions, providing a rich resource for understanding the molecular pathways orchestrating meiotic progression in the frog, and most likely applicable to other vertebrate species.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In mature females, the oocyte undergoes a long period of growth, during which meiosis is arrested at prophase I. In the <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocyte, transcription is switched off when the oocyte reaches the end of its growth phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Dumont, 1972</xref>). The full-grown oocyte is transcriptionally silent and equipped with a stock of mRNAs and proteins that will support without transcription three critical embryonic processes: first, two meiotic divisions that transform the oocyte into a fertilizable haploid egg; second, the process of fertilization; and third, 12 embryonic divisions, after which transcription is initiated.</p>
<p>The transformation of a fully-grown oocyte arrested in prophase into a fertilizable cell, arrested in metaphase of the second meiotic division is a process called meiotic maturation. Meiotic maturation is triggered by progesterone, secreted by the follicle cells surrounding the oocyte. The secretion of progesterone is stimulated by Luteinizing Hormone produced by the pituitary. Progesterone initiates a molecular signaling cascade that lasts 3 to 4 hours and occurs with little change in oocyte morphology. Notably, this cascade leads to the activation of the Cdk1-Cyclin B kinase, the universal inducer of cell division in eukaryotes. Cdk1 phosphorylates many substrates that promote meiotic nuclear events: nuclear envelope breakdown (NEBD), the formation of the first meiotic spindle marking the metaphase I (MI), the completion of the first meiotic division with expulsion of a polar body, and formation of the second meiotic spindle (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). As in all vertebrates, the frog oocyte arrests a second time in metaphase II (MII), until fertilization stimulates the completion of the second meiotic division. The entire process of oocyte maturation occurs in the absence of transcription. The regulation of the two meiotic divisions and the 13 embryonic divisions that follow are thought to be largely regulated by changes in protein abundance and phosphorylation/dephosphorylation.</p>

<p>From top to bottom: The prophase arrest is maintained by high PKA activity due to the constitutively expressed GPR185 receptor. The exocytic pathway is active while the endocytic pathway is downregulated. Cdk1-Cyclin B2 complexes are present under an inactive state due to Cdk1 phosphorylation. Progesterone activates the mPRβ receptor, GPR185 is inactivated, the exocytosis and endocytosis pathways are inverted. PKA is inactivated and promotes translation and/or accumulation of new proteins, among them Mos (that does not accumulate due to its instability) and Cyclin B1 (due to its stabilization). New Cyclin B1 proteins associate with Cdk1 and form a starter amount of Cdk1 activity. This Cdk1 starter stabilizes Mos and promotes Cdk1-Cyclin B2 activation through the regulation of Myt1, Cdc25, Gwl and PP2A. The autoamplification loop is launched, whereby more Cdk1 is activated, more it activates kinases as Mos-MAPK, Aurora-A and Plk1, all of them contributing with Cdk1 to regulate Myt1 and Cdc25, hence accelerating Cdk1 activation. Phosphorylated substrates trigger NEBD and the MI spindle assembly as well as protein translation. APC is activated under the control of Cdk1 and leads to Cyclin B degradation. The Cdk1 activity decreases and allows anaphase I and expulsion of the 1<sup>st</sup> polar body. Under the Mos/MAPK control, Emi2/Erp1 inactivates APC, halting Cyclin B degradation. The re-accumulation of Cyclin B increases Cdk1 activity that triggers the formation of the MII spindle, avoiding the assembly of a nucleus and DNA replication. APC remains inhibited by Emi2/Erp1, what ensures the oocyte arrest in MII.

<p>The prophase-arrested oocyte contains a store of Cdk1-Cyclin B complexes that are kept inhibited by Cdk1 phosphorylation at Y15 and T14, which are substrates of the kinase, Myt1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c147">Mueller et al, 1995</xref>). In all vertebrates, the prophase arrest is maintained by high levels of cAMP and PKA (cAMP-activated protein kinase) activity (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). The release of this prophase block is triggered by a drop in the levels of cAMP and the consequent inhibition of PKA, which occurs within 60 min after progesterone stimulation. The identity of the critical PKA substrates whose dephosphorylation is thought to induce the pathway leading to Cdk1 activation is still unknown, with the exception of Arpp19 whose mechanism of action is not completely understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Dupré et al, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c184">Santoni et al, 2024</xref>). Nevertheless, a drop in PKA activity leads to the synthesis of new proteins from cytoplasmic stockpiles of mRNAs as well as increases in protein level through regulation of the ubiquitination machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c184">Santoni et al, 2024</xref>). Among the accumulated proteins are Cyclin B1, the best-known activator of Cdk1 in mitotic cells, RINGO/Speedy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Ferby et al, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c128">Lenormand, 1999</xref>) and Mos, a kinase specific to the oocytes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). The newly synthesized B1-Cyclins bind to monomeric Cdk1 to form a small pool of active complexes that evade the inhibition of Myt1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">Hochegger et al, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Gaffré et al, 2011</xref>). Subsequently, this small amount of active Cdk1 initiates a complex network of feedback loops, involving many kinases and phosphatases, thereby creating an auto- amplification loop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c95">Jessus, 2010</xref>) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). Within this loop, the activation of the Cdc25 phosphatase that dephosphorylates Cdk1 and the inhibition of the PP2A phosphatase that counteracts Cdk1, lead to a rapid and full activation of Cdk1-Cyclin B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c95">Jessus, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c127">Lemonnier et al, 2020</xref>). Another important player in this positive feedback loop is Mos, whose translation is induced by progesterone and which accumulates at the time of Cdk1 activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c182">Sagata et al, 1988</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c181">1989a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Frank-Vaillant et al, 1999</xref>). Mos activates Erk1/2 (also known as MAPK) indirectly, which modulates the core regulators of Cdk1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Haccard &amp; Jessus, 2006</xref>) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). Cdk1 and the kinases activated under its control (Mos/MAPK, Aurora-A, Plk1, etc.) trigger a second wave of protein translation and accumulation, as well as mediating the structural changes of cell division: NEBD, chromosome condensation and formation of the Meiosis I spindle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c95">Jessus, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c184">Santoni et al, 2024</xref>). They also activate the anaphase-promoting complex (APC), an E3 ubiquitin ligase, leading to the degradation of both Cyclin B and securin, thus enabling entry into anaphase I, chromosome separation and the expulsion of the 1<sup>st</sup> polar body (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). The decrease in Cdk1 activity is rapidly followed by the inhibition of APC, which then allows the accumulation of B-Cyclins and increase of Cdk1 activity (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). These events trigger the entry into metaphase II and the formation of the MII spindle. In all vertebrates, oocytes arrest in the middle of the meiotic division as a result of the stabilization of cyclin B, resulting from APC inhibition by the Emi2/Erp1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c95">Jessus, 2010</xref>) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>).</p>
<p>The burst of phosphorylation, which occurs at NEBD when Cdk1 is activated, targets proteins belonging to three categories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c135">Maller et al, 1977</xref>): first, regulators of translation and/or degradation of proteins that are essential for the progression of meiotic divisions; second, proteins directly involved in the intracellular reorganization of the oocyte, such as the components of meiotic spindles, the nuclear envelope or other cytoskeletal elements; third, proteins that do not have a role in meiotic divisions but regulate fertilization and early embryonic development. Notably, the sperm does not contribute any proteins or RNA except for its genome and its two centrioles. With fertilization there is extrusion of the 2<sup>nd</sup> polar body, the fusion of the male and female pronuclei. Within a few minutes after fertilization, the first S-phase starts, followed by the first 12 embryonic division cycles, all occurring in the absence of transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Blitz &amp; Cho, 2021</xref>). Thus, these events depend exclusively on maternal proteins and mRNA. Phosphoregulation is a central and conserved mechanism that enables remodeling of the oocyte proteome and supports cell division. It prepares the oocyte to transform into the egg and undertake development. In the absence transcription our knowledge of the dynamic patterns of phosphorylation of thousands of oocyte phosphosites represents an essential tool for study of oogenesis, embryogenesis, especially the unique meiotic and mitotic processes. Interestingly, two recent studies based on phosphoproteomics have revealed new insights into how phosphorylation dynamics regulate meiotic divisions in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Celebic et al, 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c113">Koch et al, 2024</xref>) and mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c195">Sun et al, 2024</xref>). We now extend this analysis to the physiological process of oogenesis specific to non-mammalian metazoans. The study of mitotic processes in somatic cells, which are short in duration, requires exquisite synchronization, which is difficult. Although previous studies of protein phosphorylation during mitosis have revealed the identity of numerous players of cell division, especially those controlling the structural reorganization of the dividing cell and its checkpoints, they have not been able to fully elucidate the epistatic relationships between kinases and phosphatases, which are nonetheless crucial to understanding the temporal sequences regulating the various events of mitosis. This weakness is due to the fact that cell proliferation is a continuous phenomenon, without physiological arrest. Its duration varies from one cell to another within the same population. The necessity of using synchronizing agents induces non-physiological arrests, which activate checkpoints, leading to the resumption of the cell cycle not comparable to that of untreated cells. Moreover, these studies often use transformed cell lines with accumulation of mutations that makes it hard to compare with cells in a physiological cellular context. The exceptional features of oocyte maturation for experimental studies of mitosis and meiosis are: 1) the synchronicity of the process in the oocyte, initiated by a physiological signal, progesterone, 2) the natural oocyte arrests in oocyte maturation at either prophase I (equivalent to a late G2-arrest) or at MII (M-phase arrest), 3) and the large size of the oocyte (1.2 mm in diameter) and its high protein content (30 μg soluble proteins per cell), offering the rare opportunity of single-cell proteomics. In addition, the <italic>Xenopus</italic> model offers great assets. From a technical perspective, in the mouse, the small number of oocytes and their low protein content limit proteomic approaches (30,000 oocytes isolated from 950 mice were required for the phosphoproteomic profiling by (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c195">Sun et al, 2024</xref>)). Furthermore, the resumption of meiotic divisions in mouse obeys a particular regulation: unlike other mammalian models (including the human species) and other vertebrates whose entry into meiosis I depends strictly on protein translation, it does not require the synthesis of new proteins, making it a somewhat marginal model(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c142">Meneau et al, 2020</xref>). For these reasons, we performed time-resolved proteomics and phosphoproteomics in <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes from prophase I through the MII arrest of the unfertilized egg.</p>
<p>In this study, we have analyzed the changes in the phosphorylation in relation to three categories of events: specific periods of meiotic maturation, activities of the master regulators of meiosis and peculiar cellular features of meiosis. Our analysis confirms the high quality of our phosphoproteome by the detection of multiple phosphorylation events with previously-documented functional effects on meiotic divisions or early development. Through the detection of many new regulated phosphosites, it provides a rich pool of candidate proteins for multiple avenues of investigation of previously uncharacterized important players of the oocyte to embryo transition.</p>

<title>The temporal resolution of the events of meiotic divisions</title>
<p>To determine both proteome and phosphoproteome of <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes during meiosis resumption, meiotic maturation was triggered by progesterone, and oocytes were collected at regular intervals after progesterone exposure (Movie EV1, Methods): prophase oocytes (PRO) at the time of progesterone addition, then 2 hours after progesterone treatment, with hourly timepoints past that, up to 9 hours post- treatment. Groups of ten or fifty oocytes were collected at each timepoint for protein and phospho - proteomics measurements respectively. After oocyte lysis, digestion into peptides and phospho-peptide enrichment in the case of phosphoproteomics analysis, samples were processed for TMT-MS3 LC/MS (Methods).</p>
<p>To correlate the time-points of this experiment with the cytological events known to occur during meiosis resumption, a set of proteins whose accumulation had been extensively studied during <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocyte meiosis progression were used as markers. One of the first events following progesterone stimulation is the accumulation of Cyclin B1 that begins before and independently of Cdk1 activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c184">Santoni et al, 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Frank-Vaillant et al, 1999</xref>). In our experiments, Cyclin B1 accumulation starts at about 2 hours and increases linearly until MII arrest at 6.5 hours (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). It has been reported that Mos translation is stimulated by progesterone concomitant with the accumulation of Cyclin B1; however the Mos protein does not accumulate before NEBD because it turns over rapidly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c184">Santoni et al, 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Frank-Vaillant et al, 1999</xref>). Another critical well documented event that occurs downstream to Cdk1 activation is the degradation of CPEB1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c184">Santoni et al, 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c141">Mendez et al, 2002</xref>), an RNA-binding protein whose degradation activates protein translation in MI. Hence, Mos accumulation and the degradation of CPEB1 are well established markers for the timing of NEBD. After NEBD, activation of the anaphase-promoting complex (APC) leads to the ubiquitination and degradation of Cyclin B2, which marks the entry into anaphase I. During the MI-MII transition, multiple additional events take place: Cyclin B3 is degraded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Bouftas et al, 2022</xref>), Cdc6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c125">Lemaître et al, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c218">Whitmire et al, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Daldello et al, 2015</xref>), Wee2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c154">Nakajo et al, 2000</xref>) and Cyclin E (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c173">Rempel et al, 1995</xref>) accumulate, reaching their maximal levels in MII. These four events mark the entry into MII. Based on these markers, the timing of cytological events in our experiment is as follows (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>): NEBD and MI occur between 3 and 4 hours, the MI-MII transition takes place between 5 and 6 hours, and entry and arrest in MII are at 7 hours. This time course is in agreement with the cytological previously described events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">Huchon et al, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Gard, 1992</xref>). A physiological measure of MII arrest can be ascertained by the ability of the oocytes to be activated by an electric shock, a property that is acquired only in MII (Movie EV2).</p>

<title>Validation of the quantitative proteomic data</title>
<p>The quality of oocytes resuming meiosis is also confirmed by the dynamics of protein accumulation and degradation that occur during meiotic progression (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). A set of 34 proteins, whose changes in concentration have been previously studied during meiotic divisions was used to validate the quality of our quantitative proteomics data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2B-figure supplement 3A</xref>). Our proteome correctly classifies 15 out of 18 proteins accumulating during <italic>Xenopus</italic> meiosis resumption (FC(MII/PRO) &gt; 1.5), 11 out of 12 proteins whose concentration is constant (0.75 &lt; FC(MII/PRO) &lt; 1.5), and 4 out of 4 proteins whose accumulation was reported to decrease (FC(MII/PRO) &lt; 0.75) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2B-figure supplement 3A</xref>). The concordance between our dataset (30/34 proteins) with the changes in the protein levels reported in the literature is substantially higher than in a previously published system-wide proteomic dataset from <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes where only 7 out of these 34 proteins were correctly measured (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c168">Peuchen et al, 2017</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2-figure supplement 3A-B</xref>). This also may explain why changes in protein concentration reported in that study poorly correlate with the one measured in our proteomic study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2-figure supplement 3B</xref>). The high quality of the new proteomic data is also confirmed by the strong correlation of the translational pattern of <italic>Xenopus</italic> allo-alleles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2-figure supplement 3C-D</xref>), which were derived by genome endoduplication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c186">Session et al, 2016</xref>).</p>

<title>Absolute concentrations of proteins during meiotic maturation</title>
<p>The absolute concentration of 7974 proteins identified in our proteome dataset was calculated (See Appendix 1). We then performed a qualitative comparison of average oocyte abundance of proteins belonging to distinct functional groups (see Appendix 2). As expected, the less abundant subgroups include signaling molecules and transcription factors. Perhaps of more surprise, E3 enzymes and kinases are not abundant. At the other end of the spectrum are glycolytic and tricarboxylic acid cycle enzymes, as well as proteasome and ribosome components. These observations are expected because the oocyte has a stock of nutrient molecules and all the enzymes linked to their metabolism, which are used in viviparous animals throughout embryonic and larval development. For instance, the glycolytic enzyme GAPDH that catalyzes an important energy-yielding step in carbohydrate metabolism, is a very abundant protein in the oocyte (average concentration of between 8.88 μM and 17.83 μM). The ribogenesis program, which takes place during the oocyte growth from stage III to stage VI, before meiosis resumption, allows the accumulation of very large quantities of ribosomal RNAs and proteins that are used during embryonic development, until the swimming tadpole stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c221">Woodland, 1974</xref>). Similarly, the components of the DNA replication machinery are quite abundant, probably in anticipation of the post-fertilization cell cycles. All these data are therefore consistent with biological understanding of their roles during embryonic development after post-fertilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c167">Peshkin et al, 2015</xref>).</p>

<title>Temporal profiles of protein levels</title>
<p>We clustered the relative data for protein abundance across subsequent hourly timepoints post- progesterone stimulation (see Methods). As illustrated in Appendix 3A, the majority of the 60 expression profiles are flat, demonstrating that most (over 80%) proteins are stable during meiotic maturation. Our proteomic dataset allowed to identify 12% of proteins affected by changes in concentration during meiotic progression by applying the same fold change threshold: 413 proteins that accumulate and 562 proteins whose concentration decreases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2B-figure supplement 3E</xref>; see Appendix 4). Although these changes only concern a minority of proteins, they are critical for the meiotic process. Since transcription is silent during this period, these documented changes must result from the regulation of translation or/and degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c142">Meneau et al, 2020</xref>).</p>

<title>Protein accumulation: the machinery of cell division and DNA replication</title>
<p>Gene ontology analysis was used to characterize the functional significance of the 413 proteins whose level increases during meiosis. Proteins involved in spindle assembly and mitotic division were significantly enriched (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>). Among these important regulators are the Targeting-protein-for-Xklp2 (Tpx2) and Protein-regulator-of- cytokinesis 1 (Prc1) that also accumulate during meiotic maturation in mouse oocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Brunet et al, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c129">Li et al, 2021</xref>). We also find that the centrosomal maturation factor, SSX2IP, a plus-end motor kinesin, Kif11/Eg5, and a minus-end one, Kifc1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">Houliston et al, 1994</xref>), also accumulate significantly during meiotic maturation. Three of these proteins, Tpx2 and the two kinesins, play an important role in the assembly of both acentrosomal meiotic spindles and centrosomal mitotic spindles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Gruss, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c115">Kufer et al, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Ems-McClung et al, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c144">Miller et al, 2019</xref>). Interestingly, the prophase oocyte is equipped with most of the proteins essential for the formation of division spindles. Hence these new results suggest that increases in the relative level of some components is required to support the meiotic and first rapid embryonic divisions.</p>
<p>Another protein category found to increase is the machinery of DNA replication initiation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>). Indeed, oocytes accumulate the components of the DNA replication machinery during meiosis resumption to support the 12 rapid rounds of cell cycles occurring during early embryogenesis, all of which occur in the absence of transcription. In <italic>Xenopus</italic>, Cdc6 is a component of the pre-replicative (pre-RC) complex that is not detectable in the prophase-arrested oocyte by western blot (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c125">Lemaître et al, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c218">Whitmire et al, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Daldello et al, 2015</xref>). Cdc6 accumulation occurs during the MI-MII transition to confer oocytes the competence to replicate DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c125">Lemaître et al, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c218">Whitmire et al, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Daldello et al, 2015</xref>) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). Translational and then post-translational mechanisms targeting Cdc6 prevent the pre- RC from functioning between the two meiotic divisions, thus ensuring the production of a haploid gamete. Our proteomic analysis shows that, additional pre-RC proteins, as ORC1, ORC2 and ORC6 accumulate during meiotic maturation, revealing a strong co-regulation of the components of the pre-RC.</p>
<p>Another process controlled by highly enriched proteins is vesicle tethering, which includes the family of exocyst proteins (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>). Interestingly, exocyst proteins are involved in the completion of cell division during the secretory-vesicle-mediated abscission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Gromley et al, 2005</xref>). The accumulation of these proteins during meiotic maturation could be important to support the extrusion of the polar bodies, as already suggested in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c116">Kumar et al, 2019</xref>) and the rapid cell divisions sustaining early embryogenesis.</p>

<title>Protein degradation: RNA-binding proteins (RBPs)</title>
<p>Gene ontology analysis of the 562 proteins whose concentration decreases during meiosis reveals that 116 (21 %) are annotated to bind RNA. Among them, a large portion are RNA helicases (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>). Among these RBPs, another important group are proteins that are involved in ribosome biogenesis. The ribogenesis program takes place during the oocyte growth, allowing the accumulation of ribosomal RNAs and proteins that are used during embryonic development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c221">Woodland, 1974</xref>). This process is downregulated during meiotic maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">Hyman &amp; Wormington, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Chen et al, 2011</xref>). The decrease in the concentration of proteins involved in rRNA synthesis and processing does not result in a general decrease of ribosomal proteins that are stable during meiotic divisions (<xref rid="fig2s4" ref-type="fig">Figure 2-figure supplement 4A</xref>). Halting ribogenesis may allow the oocyte to re-allocate its energy resources to the production of other cellular components required for meiotic divisions and embryogenesis. Intriguingly, Rpl26 (Ribosomal protein L26) is the only ribosomal protein detected to decrease during meiotic divisions (<xref rid="fig2s4" ref-type="fig">Figure 2-figure supplement 4A</xref>). Since this protein is known to be dispensable for ribosome formation in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Babiano et al, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c215">Warner &amp; McIntosh, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c198">Takagi et al, 2005</xref>), the distinct regulation of Rpl26 as compared to the other Rpls suggests that Rpl26 might have extra- ribosomal functions. This hypothesis is reinforced by its specific modification by the ubiquitin-like UFMylation modification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c213">Walczak et al, 2019</xref>) and its role in the regulation of protein stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c229">Zhang et al, 2016</xref>). Another subgroup of RBPs that decrease during meiotic divisions is involved in the repression of translation during prophase arrest, such as CPEB1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c141">Mendez et al, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c174">Reverte et al, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c169">Piqué et al, 2008</xref>), PATL2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c155">Nakamura et al, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Cao et al, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Christou-Kent et al, 2018</xref>) and Zar1l (Zar2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Charlesworth et al, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c224">Yamamoto et al, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c178">Rong et al, 2019</xref>). Remodeling the repertoire of RBPs in the oocyte could be a general mechanism to regulate translation during meiotic divisions. Among these RBPs is Serbp1, which in mouse is involved in the stabilization of mRNA involved in meiosis resumption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Chew et al, 2013</xref>) and in ribosome hibernation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c123">Leesch et al, 2023</xref>), as well as Caprin2, whose degradation is also observed during meiotic maturation of human oocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c212">Virant-Klun et al, 2016</xref>). Caprin2 is a RBP with unknown function and highly enriched in the oocyte Balbiani body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Boke et al, 2016</xref>), a non- membrane compartment specific to the early diplotene oocytes, which contains mitochondria, RNAs and endoplasmic reticulum. The functions of this organelle are not clear, although it is strongly correlated in <italic>Xenopus</italic> to the establishment of oocyte polarity and to the localization of maternal determinants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c94">Jamieson-Lucy &amp; Mullins, 2019</xref>). In <italic>Xenopus</italic>, it disperses at the onset of vitellogenesis, leaving a wedge- shaped cytoplasmic region rich in mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c219">Wilk et al, 2005</xref>) and promotes the formation of RNP condensates in the vegetal cortex of the oocyte (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c226">Yang et al, 2022</xref>). Interestingly, Rbpms2, another regulator of the Balbiani body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c102">Kaufman et al, 2018</xref>), is strongly degraded during meiotic maturation, highlighting how dynamic during meiosis is the composition of this transient compartment specific to the oocyte.</p>
<p>Interestingly, distinct E3 ubiquitin ligases, mainly APC and SCF (Skp, Cullin, F-box containing complex) have been shown to be active at different time periods of meiosis resumption in <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c108">Kinterová et al, 2022</xref>). 186 proteins (37%) identified as decreasing in our proteome include in their sequences one of the APC degrons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2-figure supplement 4B</xref>). This group of proteins includes two known APC targets, Cyclin B2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Glotzer et al, 1991</xref>) and Securin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Cohen-Fix et al, 1996</xref>). Additionally, 30 proteins (6%) whose concentration decreases in the oocytes have one SCF degron in their sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2-figure supplement 4B</xref>), including CPEB1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c174">Reverte et al, 2001</xref>) and Cdc6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Daldello et al, 2015</xref>), two characterized SCF-targets. Interestingly, 253 proteins (57%) of proteins that decrease during meiotic divisions do not bear in their sequence any of the degrons for the ubiquitination systems identified in <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2-figure supplement 4B</xref>). Further research is therefore required to identify the sequences and the E3 enzymes and deubiquitinating enzymes that control the turnover of this important protein class.</p>

<title>The highly dynamic landscape of phosphorylation during meiotic maturation</title>
<p>We performed phosphoproteomic mass spectrometry analysis in order to measure the overall dynamics of protein phosphorylation taking place during meiotic divisions and to identify which specific proteins and which sites are phosphorylated during this process. We identified 6783 different phosphor-peptides and quantified the dynamics of relative change across all time points (see Appendix 5). These peptides came from 2308 distinct proteins. Our phosphosites dataset contains 80% Ser, 19.9% Thr, and 0.01% Tyr. Phospho-Tyr are slightly less abundant than what has been described in most cells (up to 0.05% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c188">Sharma et al, 2014</xref>)). The same observation was made regarding the distribution of phosphorylated amino acids in mouse oocytes, where phospho-Tyr abundance is relatively diminished in oocytes compared to mouse organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c195">Sun et al, 2024</xref>). When respective protein and un-phosphorylated peptide were also measured, we were able to compute the stoichiometry (see Methods). A list of all 415 phosphosites for which it was possible to calculate the phospho-occupancy is provided (see Appendix 6).</p>
<p>We identified the human homologous counterparts of 5901 (87%) among the 6783 sites found to be phosphorylated during meiotic divisions. Interestingly, only 177 (3%) out of 5901 conserved sites were already known to be phosphorylated on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://phosphosite.org">phosphosite.org</ext-link> database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.phosphosite.org/homeAction">https://www.phosphosite.org/homeAction</ext-link>). Thus, our phosphosite dataset identifies a very large number of novel phosphosites, never previously identified and characterized. Such a small number of previously reported phosphorylations among those detected by our phosphoproteome might suggest that a large portion of these phosphorylation events are related to cell division. Dividing cells generally account for a small fraction of tissue mass. This leads to a high dilution of the phosphorylation signature of cell division, as compared to the highly synchronous meiotic divisions of oocyte maturation. Interestingly, 60% of the phosphosites detected in oocytes are dynamically regulated during meiotic maturation, highlighting the importance of this post-translational regulation in controlling this last step of oogenesis and meiosis. Unbiased clustering reveals that changes in protein phosphorylation are pervasive and far more dynamic than changes in protein abundance (see Appendix 3), which was also noted during yeast meiosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c113">Koch et al, 2024</xref>). Comparing the three stages of meiotic division (PRO, MI and MII) and based on the main cellular events of these stages, we can group phosphor-peptide stoichiometry into 5 classes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>; see Appendix 5). Class I includes proteins bearing a phosphosite whose occupancy decreases during the first 2 hours following progesterone stimulation. This class includes only 136 phospho-peptides (2%) which might be involved in the early signaling pathway induced by progesterone and PKA downregulation. This small number was expected since there is a low level of phosphorylation detectable in prophase-arrested oocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c135">Maller et al, 1977</xref>). This makes sense since there are presumably only a few substrates of PKA sufficient to initiate meiosis resumption. Class II is larger (39% of the phosphor-peptides) and includes proteins whose phosphorylation increases between NEBD and MI and which remain highly phosphorylated in both MI and MII. The massive amount of Class II phosphosites presumably reflects the catalytic power of Cdk1 as well as its downstream kinases, to generate the thousands of substrates essential for cell division. We used the online server (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://kinase-library.phosphosite.org/kinase-library/score-site">https://kinase-library.phosphosite.org/kinase-library/score-site</ext-link>) to score the phosphosites in the Class II and predict the kinases likely responsible for their phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c99">Johnson et al, 2023</xref>). Using a percentile score threshold of 90, we identified 303, 304, and 267 peptides predicted to be phosphorylated by Cdk1, Erk1/2, and Plk1, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3— figure supplement 1A</xref>). Among these, 166 sites were predicted to be efficiently phosphorylated by either Cdk1 or Erk1/2, consistent with the similarity in their phosphorylation consensus motifs. In contrast, there was minimal overlap between the sites predicted to be phosphorylated by Plk1 and those targeted by Cdk1 or Erk1/2. Consequently, Class II phosphorylations are largely dependent on Cdk1 activity, whether they are directly catalyzed by this kinase or indirectly through kinases under its control, such as Erk1/2 and Plk1 (see below). Our measurements that most of the sites, which are phosphorylated in MI, remain stably phosphorylated during MI to MII transition is consistent with the observations made in yeast showing that most of Cdk1 motifs remain phosphorylated at the end of meiosis I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Celebic et al, 2024</xref>). Class III (5%) consists of proteins whose phosphorylation peaks in MI then decreases while oocytes progress throughout meiotic maturation. This is the most predominant class of phosphosites present during meiotic maturation in starfish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c196">Swartz et al, 2021</xref>) and follow the peculiar pattern of Cdk1 activity peaking at MI in these oocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c158">Okano-Uchida et al, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c110">Kishimoto, 2003</xref>). Class IV (9%) is composed of proteins whose phosphorylation progressively increases from MI to MII, hence potentially implicated in MII entry. Finally, Class V (5%) comprises proteins whose phosphorylation increases from MII and which could play a role in establishing the MII arrest. The phosphosites that are specific for either MI (Class III) or MII (Classes IV and V) are much less abundant (5%, 9% and 5% respectively, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>) and might distinguish the biochemical state of the two meiotic divisions. These conclusions were supported by the identification of the kinases whose predicted phosphorylation sites are most enriched within each class, by using the same server (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://kinase-library.phosphosite.org/kinase-library/score-site">https://kinase-library.phosphosite.org/kinase-library/score-site</ext-link>). Each class was associated with a distinct set of enriched kinases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3-figure supplement 1B</xref>). It confirms that Cdk1 and its downstream kinases, Erk1/2 and Plk1 are the master regulators in Class II. The kinases identified in Classes IV and V may represent novel regulators of entry into and arrest at MII.</p>

<title>The release of the prophase arrest: receptors and membrane trafficking</title>
<sec id="s2e1">
<title>Receptors</title>
<p>Since meiotic maturation signaling begins with the interaction of progesterone with membrane receptors, we first focused our analysis on these proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c100">Josefsberg Ben-Yehoshua et al, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c180">Sadler &amp; Maller, 1985</xref>). Progesterone signals through activation of a seven-pass-transmembra ne progesterone receptor (mPRβ or PAQR8) that belongs to the progestin and adiponectin receptor family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c100">Josefsberg Ben-Yehoshua et al, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c150">Nader et al, 2018</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c152">2020</xref>) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). The release of the prophase block also involves the inactivation of an orphan constitutively active GPCR, GPR185, responsible for maintaining oocyte prophase arrest by ensuring high cAMP levels and PKA activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c176">Ríos-Cardona et al, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Deng et al, 2008</xref>). Progesterone decreases GPR185 signaling either through its cleavage by a metalloproteinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Deng et al, 2008</xref>) or through its endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c151">Nader et al, 2014</xref>). One limitation of our dataset lies in the loss of some membrane proteins during the fractionation protocol, explaining why our proteomic workflow did not detect mPRβ and GPR185 or its close relative GPR12. Nevertheless, it does detect some proteins that interact with mPR, <italic>i.e.</italic> PGRMC1, VLDLR and APPL1. PGRMC1 is known to form a receptor complex with mPRα and is necessary for mediating progesterone signaling in zebrafish oocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c222">Wu et al, 2018</xref>). Interestingly, our phosphorylation data reveals that PGRMC1 and its close relative PGRMC2 are phosphorylated on two homologous threonine residues during meiotic maturation, suggesting that these proteins may contribute to mPRβ activity in <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes. In the prophase- arrested oocyte, VLDLR regulates mPR trafficking from the endoplasmic reticulum through the Golgi to the plasma membrane, preparing the oocyte to be responsive to progesterone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c150">Nader et al, 2018</xref>). In contrast, progesterone induces clathrin-dependent endocytosis of mPRβ into signaling endosomes, where mPR interacts transiently with APPL1 and Akt2 to induce meiosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c152">Nader et al, 2020</xref>). The phosphoproteomic data reveal that both APPL1 and Akt are phosphorylated in response to progesterone but at the time of Cdk1 activation and on residues distinct from those identified by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c152">Nader et al. (2020)</xref>. Hence, phosphorylation events may continue to regulate the trafficking and activity of this receptor during meiotic maturation, ensuring that the plasma membrane of the future egg is devoid of any steroid receptor.</p>

<sec id="s2e2">
<title>Membrane traffic</title>
<p>Vesicular trafficking at the cell membrane appears to be crucial for the maintenance and the release the prophase meiotic arrest, and may also function through early embryogenesis (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). In the prophase-arrested oocyte, the accumulation of the GPR185 receptor at the plasma membrane maintains high cAMP levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c151">Nader et al, 2014</xref>) while the plasma membrane targeting of mPRβ renders the oocyte competent to respond to progesterone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c150">Nader et al, 2018</xref>).</p>
<p>Exocytosis is also crucial for the formation of the fluid-filled blastocoele cavity during embryogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c148">Müller, 2001</xref>). Indeed, the apical membrane of the epithelium surrounding the blastula, where the polarized activities of ion channels and transporters generate the blastocoele fluid, is formed from the oocyte cell membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c148">Müller, 2001</xref>). This requires further remodeling. Progesterone rapidly blocks this exocytosis pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Colman et al, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c120">Leaf et al, 1990</xref>), leading to a decrease in membrane surface area, which is revealed by the disappearance of microvilli that are enriched in oocytes but almost absent in eggs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Dumont, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c101">Kado et al, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c119">Larabell &amp; Chandler, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Bluemink et al, 1983</xref>).</p>
<p>Importantly, blocking exocytosis induces meiotic maturation, in the absence of hormonal stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c149">Mulner-Lorillon et al, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">El-Jouni et al, 2007</xref>). Furthermore, progesterone stimulates endocytosis of membrane proteins, such as GPR185, whose activity is suppressed by its internalization, and mPRβ, whose internalization is required to transduce its effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c150">Nader et al, 2018</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c152">2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c151">2014</xref>). The stimulation of endocytosis also converts plasma membrane into intracellular vesicles that can provide membrane reserves, necessary to support the rapid cell divisions, and hence the requirement for greater total membrane surface area, during embryogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Angres et al, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Gawantka et al, 1992</xref>). However, it is unknown whether PKA is responsible for the active secretory transport during the prophase arrest and how progesterone blocks exocytosis and stimulates endocytosis (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>).</p>
<p>To improve our understanding of vesicular trafficking and membrane organization, we analyzed the proteins involved in these processes whose phosphosites belong to Class I (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). Among these proteins, PI4KB deserves special attention. This protein is critical for the maintenance of the Golgi and trans-Golgi phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate (PI4) pools. PI4KB regulates Golgi disintegration/reorganization during mitosis and is involved in Golgi-to-plasma membrane trafficking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">De Matteis et al, 2013</xref>). The phosphoproteome reveals that PI4KB is dephosphorylated within 2 hours after progesterone stimulation, on a PKA consensus phosphorylation site conserved in vertebrates. The phosphorylation of this site by PKA is known to control the interaction of PI4KB with Armadillo-like helical domain-containing protein 3 (ARMH3), an interaction important for the Golgi membrane integrity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c140">McPhail et al, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c92">Isobe et al, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Blomen et al, 2015</xref>). PI4KB is also regulated by its interaction with ACBD3, an AKAP-like scaffold platform in Golgi, which directly binds the R regulatory subunit of PKA and regulates the traffic between Golgi and endoplasmic reticulum in a PKA-depending manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c98">Jia et al, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c111">Klima et al, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c185">Sasaki et al, 2012</xref>). The phosphoproteome reveals that ACBD3 is phosphorylated during meiotic maturation at the time of NEBD (Class II). PI4KB is therefore at the crossroad between PKA and intra-membrane endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi-plasma membrane trafficking. Since these are key events involved in meiosis resumption, PI4KB is a particularly attractive candidate as a PKA substrate for future functional studies of membrane relocalization.</p>
<p>Proteins involved in the actin cytoskeleton are also represented in Class I phosphosites (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). Their early post-translational modifications could regulate the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton that is known to accompany the modification of the secretory/endocytosis pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Gard, 1999</xref>). Among them, ITPRID2/KRAP tethers IP<sub>3</sub> receptors, which are located in the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum, to the actin under the plasma membrane, to mediate Ca<sup>2+</sup> signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c204">Thillaiappan et al, 2021</xref>). During meiotic maturation, the endoplasmic reticulum, which is the major Ca<sup>2+</sup> store, is enriched in the cortex of the oocyte (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Campanella et al, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Charbonneau &amp; Grey, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c202">Terasaki et al, 2001</xref>). This remodeling brings the Ca<sup>2+</sup> source close to its primary targets at fertilization, when Ca<sup>2+</sup> release from endoplasmic reticulum activates the oocyte and blocks polyspermy. The proteins highlighted above (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>) could participate to this critical reorganization of the endoplasmic reticulum.</p>

<title>Protein translation and accumulation orchestrate meiotic divisions</title>
<p>Two waves of translation take place in the oocytes: the first depends on PKA inactivation. It occurs upstream and independently of Cdk1 activity and is required for Cdk1 activation. The second translation wave takes place downstream Cdk1 activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c184">Santoni et al, 2024</xref>). Hence, in contrast to mitosis, a period when protein synthesis is repressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c179">Ross, 1997</xref>), translation is activated during meiotic maturation, indicating the existence of meiosis-specific controls of the process. However, the regulation of the two waves of protein translation and the identity of the newly translated proteins had not been unraveled. Interestingly, protein translation components are extensively regulated at the level of phosphorylation as demonstrated by the enrichment of the proteins regulating these processes among 3 of the 5 phospho - peptide classes (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>).</p>

<title>RBPs and translational control</title>
<p>Interestingly, several proteins implicated in the control of translation bear phosphosites belonging to Class I, as eIF4ENIF1/4E-T, PATL1 and TACC3/Maskin (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3B</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4B</xref>). eIF4ENIF1/4E-T is required for eIF4e1b localization to P-bodies where mRNAs are stored in a dormant state in zebrafish oocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c132">Lorenzo-Orts et al, 2023</xref>). Both 4E-T and eIF4e1b are extensively phosphorylated on multiple residues during meiotic divisions, suggesting a highly dynamic regulation of P-bodies during this process (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>). Many RBPs known to control translation in oocytes are also regulated at the phosphorylation level, including Pum proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c153">Nakahata et al, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c160">Ota et al, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c161">Padmanabhan, 2006</xref>), Zar proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Charlesworth et al, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c224">Yamamoto et al, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c178">Rong et al, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">Heim et al, 2022</xref>) and PATL proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Christou-Kent et al, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c230">Zhang et al, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c136">Marnef et al, 2010</xref>). PATL1 is a RNA-binding protein required for cytoplasmic mRNA P-body assembly in oocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c136">Marnef et al, 2010</xref>). PATL1 and PATL2 have mutually exclusive expression patterns in <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes: PATL2 is degraded, as confirmed by our proteomic data (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B,D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2-figure supplement 3A-B</xref>), while PATL1 accumulates during meiotic maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c136">Marnef et al, 2010</xref>) or is stable (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2-figure supplement 3B</xref>). Although the role of PATL2 and the regulation of its stability by phosphorylation have been well documented in the oocyte (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Christou-Kent et al, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c230">Zhang et al, 2023</xref>), little is known about the role of PATL1 during meiosis. Both PATL1 and 2 inhibit translation when tethered to mRNA and assemble a complex that includes CPEB1, Xp54/DDX6, Rap55B/LSM14b (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c136">Marnef et al, 2010</xref>) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>).</p>
<p>The early dephosphorylation of PATL1 detected in the phosphoproteome could modulate this inhibitory complex during early events of meiotic maturation, while the extensive phosphorylation of the other components of the complex could control its activity later during meiotic divisions (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>). Another component of the repressive complex is TACC3/Maskin. It interacts with CPEB1, although this interaction, and thus its role in regulation of translation, could not be reproduced in other studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c145">Minshall et al, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Duran-Arqué et al, 2022</xref>). Importantly, besides its function in translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Barnard et al, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Groisman et al, 2002</xref>), TACC3/Maskin also regulates the centrosome-mediated microtubule nucleation through γ-TuRC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c165">Peset et al, 2005</xref>). TACC3/Maskin is found widely regulated during meiotic divisions in the phosphoproteome (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>). Eight residues in TACC3/Maskin, of which only two are conserved in human Maskin (214/228 and 298/317 in human/<italic>Xenopus</italic>), exhibit a complex profile of phosphorylation (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>). Two sites identified in the phosphoproteome, S266 and S298, were previously found to be phosphorylated in egg extracts, regulating the function of TACC3/Maskin in the control of translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Barnard et al, 2005</xref>). S626 was also reported to be phosphorylated in prophase oocytes and during oocyte meiotic maturation, although there is some controversy about the kinase (either PKA or Aurora-A) and the role of this phosphorylation in either the control of translation or centrosome attachment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Barnard et al, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c162">Pascreau et al, 2005</xref>). Interestingly, in our studies S240 is phosphorylated in the prophase oocyte and dephosphorylated early in response to progesterone (Class I) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>). Since the sequence surrounding S240 does not correspond to a PKA consensus motif, it is hard to establish the biological significance; nevertheless, such an early dephosphorylation deserves further attention.</p>

<title>The control of translation initiation</title>
<p>Translation regulation might not only depend on the expression and post-translational regulation of the RBPs but could also involve the regulation of the core translation initiation machinery, since we find that many of its components are phosphorylated (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>). Indeed, eIF4b, an activator of the eIF4a helicase that facilitates ribosome scanning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93">Jackson et al, 2010</xref>), eIF2b/eIF2s2, a component of the molecular machinery recruitment on the met-tRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93">Jackson et al, 2010</xref>), and eIF4g, involved in the recognition of the mRNA 5’Cap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93">Jackson et al, 2010</xref>), are among the proteins bearing sites whose phosphorylation peaks in MII (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4-figure supplement 1</xref>). These phosphorylation patterns correlate with the second wave of activation of translation that begins under the control of Cdk1 activity in MI and continues progressively through MII (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c142">Meneau et al, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c184">Santoni et al, 2024</xref>).</p>

<title>The control of ubiquitin ligases</title>
<p>The levels of specific proteins are also regulated by proteolysis at each step of meiotic maturation. Targeted regulation allows for the accumulation of key proteins independently of any general increase in their translation, such as for Cyclin B1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c184">Santoni et al, 2024</xref>), or the well-studied degradation of proteins, such as Cyclin B2, securin or CPEB1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c197">Taieb et al, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c216">Wassmann, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c187">Setoyama et al, 2007</xref>). Interestingly, proteins controlling polyubiquitination display phosphor-peptides enriched in Class II, strengthening the view that a major regulation of protein turnover takes place at NEBD in order to orchestrate meiotic divisions (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5A</xref>). APC is the key E3 ubiquitin ligase that promotes metaphase-anaphase transition. Although the phosphorylation status of some substrates determines their recognition by APC and influences the precise timing of their degradation, APC activity is also regulated by the phosphorylation of its core subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bansal &amp; Tiwari, 2019</xref>) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>).</p>

<p>Another important ubiquitination system that regulates stability of proteins during mitosis and meiosis is the SCF complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c108">Kinterová et al, 2022</xref>). SCF is composed of three main components: Cul1, a scaffold protein; Skp1, which interacts with specific F-box proteins that are involved in the substrate recognition; and Rbx1, which interacts with the E2-ubiquitin ligases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c108">Kinterová et al, 2022</xref>) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>). SCF ligases play important roles during oocyte meiotic maturation, especially the SCF<sup>βTrCP</sup> complex. Indeed, SCF<sup>βTrCP</sup> mediates the degradation of multiple cell cycle regulators as Emi1, Emi2/Erp1, CPEB1 and BTG4, whose degradation is required for progression through MI and MII in mouse and <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c108">Kinterová et al, 2022</xref>). Similar functions played by such protein degradations occur in mitosis, as Emi1 degradation that releases APC inhibition, then inducing Cyclin B destruction and mitotic exit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c172">Reimann et al, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Many F-Box proteins are also expressed in <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes, but they do not display high phosphorylation dynamics. An exception is Lmo7/Fbxo20, which is degraded during meiosis, and is dynamically phosphorylated (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>). Interestingly, Lmo7 overexpression causes defects at the spindle assembly checkpoint, affecting the progression through mitotic divisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c207">Tzeng et al, 2018</xref>).</p>
<p>Additionally, many E2 enzymes were identified in our datasets as highly regulated at the translational/accumulation and post-translational levels during meiotic maturation (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>). This layer of regulation of protein ubiquitination remains understudied. Interestingly, an E2/E3 hybrid ubiquitin- protein ligase, UBE2O, UBE4B (also known as UBOX3 or E4) and FAF2 (or Ubxn3B/UBXD8) display phosphorylation sites belonging to Class I (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3B</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5C</xref>). FAF2 is involved in stress granule clearance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Gwon et al, 2021</xref>). UBE2O is also known to be involved in the drastic proteome remodeling during erythroid differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c156">Nguyen et al, 2017</xref>), as well as quality control factor for orphans of multiprotein complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c225">Yanagitani et al, 2017</xref>). Ribosomal proteins are known substrates of UBE2O which leads to their degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c156">Nguyen et al, 2017</xref>). Whether UBE2O is involved in the downregulation of ribosome biogenesis that occurs during meiotic maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">Hyman &amp; Wormington, 1988</xref>), and in the decrease of Rpl26 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2-figure supplement 4A</xref>), is an interesting question. The dephosphorylation of UBE2O, UBE4B and FAF2 could also be involved in the accumulation of Cyclin B1, which was recently shown to occur independently of any increase in translation but to result from protein stabilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c184">Santoni et al, 2024</xref>).</p>
<p>Another important regulator of the SCF system, DCUN1D5, is found regulated in our phosphoproteome. DCUN1D5 catalyzes the neddylation of all cullins, which is necessary for the activation of cullin-RING E3 ubiquitin ligases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c105">Keuss et al, 2016</xref>). DCUN1D5 is dephosphorylated at S9, a PKA consensus site, and phosphorylated starting NEBD at S10 and S12 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>). These phosphorylations could control DCUN1D5 ability to activate SCF, especially since the inhibition of neddylation causes a meiotic arrest in MI in mouse oocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c227">Yang et al, 2019</xref>). Altogether, our dataset provides attractive candidates to be involved in the regulation of both translation and protein stability that occur during meiotic maturation.</p>

<title>Activation of Cdk1 occurs through an intricate network of phosphorylation of Cdk1 regulators</title>
<p>The activation of Cdk1 during oocyte maturation relies on an intricate network of feedforward and feedback phosphorylation pathways mediated by kinases and phosphatases (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). Indeed, components of the cell division machinery are highly enriched among Class II, III, IV and V (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>). Some of the phosphorylation sites implicated in cell division control have been identified previously through detailed studies using site-specific mutagenesis and phospho-specific antibodies. Our phosphoproteomic analysis of oocyte maturation provides new regulatory elements (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>). An important regulator of the Cdk1 auto-amplification loop is the kinase Plk1 that contributes to the phosphorylation of the two direct Cdk1 regulators, Cdc25 and Myt1. Plk1 is activated by Aurora-A, a kinase itself under the indirect control of Cdk1 in <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocyte (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c138">Maton et al, 2003</xref>), through the phosphorylation of T210 (T201 in <italic>Xenopus</italic>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c134">Macůrek et al, 2008</xref>), a residue localized in the activation T- loop of the kinase domain. We show here that Plk1 phosphorylation at T210 increases in MI and is then constant throughout meiotic maturation (Class II) (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref> and EV2A). This is consistent with the function of Plk1, which phosphorylates multiple proteins required for the mechanics of division, and which must logically be kept active throughout both meiotic divisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Hansen et al, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c189">Solc et al, 2015</xref>). Interestingly, the phosphoproteome also detects additional phosphorylation sites of Plk1, S326 (S335 in human) and S340 (not conserved in human), which were previously found to be upregulated in response to okadaic acid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c220">Wind et al, 2002</xref>), an inhibitor of PP2A that strongly induces M-phase. These two residues are located between the two functional domains of Plk1, the kinase domain and the Polo-box domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Cheng, 2003</xref>). This suggests that the phosphorylation of other critical residues than T210 of Plk1 could be essential for its catalytic activation. Aurora-A kinase is activated during meiotic maturation downstream Cdk1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c138">Maton et al, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Castro et al, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c137">Maton et al, 2005</xref>). While our phosphoproteome does not detect Aurora-A autophosphorylation at T288 (T295 in <italic>Xenopus</italic>), it registers the extensive phosphorylation of Bora, an activator of Aurora-A involved in Plk1 activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c205">Thomas et al, 2016</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6B-figure supplement 1B</xref>). Several phosphorylation sites of Bora have been reported to be important for its function as an Aurora-A activator: S41/38, S112/110, S137/135 and S252/S252 (human/<italic>Xenopus</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c205">Thomas et al, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c210">Vigneron et al, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c200">Tavernier et al, 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c201">2021</xref>). Among these sites, S110 phosphorylation of Bora by Cdk1-Cyclin A is critical for mitotic entry in <italic>Xenopus</italic> egg extracts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c210">Vigneron et al, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c200">Tavernier et al, 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c201">2021</xref>). Our phosphoproteome reveals that Bora belongs to Class II, being phosphorylated starting NEBD, but surprisingly on distinct sites that were never reported in the literature: S191/189, T294/287, S552/549, S-/521, T12/9 and T15/12 (human/<italic>Xenopus</italic>), with the exception of S278/285. In contrast to the situation in mitosis, Cyclin A is very weakly expressed in the prophase oocyte and accumulates during meiotic maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c112">Kobayashi et al, 1991</xref>). Our proteome dataset reveals that Cyclin A accumulates after MI. Hence, the phosphorylation of Bora at MI cannot be catalyzed by Cdk1- Cyclin A in the <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocyte. Cdk1-Cyclin B is probably involved in these phosphorylations that take place concomitantly with its activity and at Cdk1 phosphorylation consensus sites for 5 of the 7 phosphosites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6B-figure supplement 1B</xref>). Thus, this analysis reveals that Bora activation correlates with its phosphorylation at residues not previously identified in earlier studies of the oocyte. We also detect additional phosphorylation events on other players of the Cdk1 amplification loop, as Cdc25 and Gwl/MASTL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6B-figure supplement 1C-D</xref>), whose extensive phosphorylation during M-phase is usually detected by a large electrophoretic shift (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Dupré et al, 2014</xref>).</p>

<title>Phosphoregulation of the bimodal activity of Cdk1 during MI-MII transition</title>
<p>In <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes, Cdk1 is not fully inactivated at anaphase I and during extrusion of the 1<sup>st</sup> polar body. Indeed, the low Cdk1 activity that persists during the MI-MII transition is essential to avoid the reformation of a nucleus, chromosome decondensation and DNA replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">Huchon et al, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c203">Thibier et al, 1997</xref>). This short period is followed by a further increase of Cdk1 activity, due to a sustained synthesis of B-cyclins; the increased Cdk1 activity allows the formation of the MII spindle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Gerhart et al, 1984</xref>) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). Although this bimodal subtle regulation of Cdk1 activity is essential for the success of meiosis, <italic>i.e</italic>. linking two successive divisions without intervening DNA replication, it has never been quantified precisely. Cdk1 activity can be measured by looking at the phosphorylation of one of its direct substrates, Cdc27, a core APC component, at S428 (S426 in human)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c163">Patra &amp; Dunphy, 1998</xref>). Since PP2A, the phosphatase responsible for dephosphorylating Cdc27, is inactive during the MI-MII transition, the phosphorylation levels of Cdc27 can be directly attributed to Cdk1 activity during this period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Deák et al, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c206">Torres et al, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c126">Lemonnier et al, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c118">Labbé et al, 2021</xref>). Our precise quantification of the phospho-occupancy of this site shows that its phosphorylation is virtually absent in prophase, increases by 40% in MI, decreases during the MI-MII transition to 20%, then increases again in MII by 60% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6-figure supplement 1E</xref>). Three other residues of Cdc27, T205/207, S435/437 and S438/440 (human/<italic>Xenopus</italic>), also known to be phosphorylated at M-phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c114">Kraft, 2003</xref>), follow the same bimodal pattern than S428. The subsequent increase in Cdk1 activity essential for MII entry requires that the kinase escapes inhibitory phosphorylations by Myt1 and Wee2. Both Myt1 and Wee2 are reported to be inhibited by phosphorylations, although the sites responsible for this inhibition are not precisely defined. In <italic>Xenopus</italic>, Wee2 is not expressed in prophase oocytes and accumulates after NEBD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c154">Nakajo et al, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Charlesworth et al, 2012</xref>) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). Our analysis reveals that newly synthesized Wee2 is immediately phosphorylated at 4 sites (Classes II and IV), one of them being not conserved in human, and none of them corresponding to the proposed inhibitory S53 and S123 sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6A-B-figure supplement 1F</xref>). Hence, these data provide exciting new avenues of research to discover unexpected new regulations of old players in Cdk1 activation.</p>

<title>The Mos/MAPK pathway activation</title>

It phosphorylates Mek1/2, which in turn phosphorylates Erk1/2 (also known as MAPK) which leads to Rsk1/2 activation (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>). These play multiple essential roles, such as preventing the reformation of a replicating nucleus between MI and MII (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Dupre et al, 2002</xref>), enabling arrest in MII (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c183">Sagata et al, 1989b</xref>), but also participating in Cdk1 activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c181">Sagata et al, 1989a</xref>) and the functioning of meiotic spindles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Araki et al, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Choi et al, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Bodart et al, 2005</xref>). The phosphoproteome detects the activation of the Mos-MAPK module, with the phosphorylation of Erk2 on T185 and Y187 (T188 and Y190 in <italic>Xenopus</italic>) by MEK1/2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c164">Payne et al, 1991</xref>), an event that begins in MI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6B-figure supplement 2A</xref>). Interestingly, additional phosphorylation sites are identified in MEK1 and Rsk1/2, the latter being hyperphosphorylated during meiosis as detected by a large electrophoretic shift (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Bhatt &amp; Ferrell, 2000</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6B-figure supplement 2B-E</xref>).

Our phosphoproteome measures a highly-confident phospho-occupancy for this site demonstrating the switch-like activation of the MAPK pathway at NEBD, followed by the maintenance of a constant level of its activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6B-figure supplement 2F</xref>). The timing of activation of the Mos-MAPK cascade has been controversial, one hypothesis being that it is activated before Cdk1 and participates in the activation of this kinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c182">Sagata et al, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Gavin et al, 1999</xref>), while another is that it is under the control of the starter Cdk1 activity and is only involved in the autoamplification loop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c184">Santoni et al, 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Dupre et al, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Fisher et al, 1999</xref>).

<title>Phosphorylation of key components of the nuclear envelope during breakdown</title>
<p>As a result of the massive activation of kinase activities under the control of Cdk1, hundreds of proteins are phosphorylated and orchestrate the structural events choreographing the mechanics of meiotic divisions. The first of these is the massive vesiculation of the nuclear envelope surrounding the enormous oocyte nucleus. During mitosis, nuclear pore proteins are extensively phosphorylated by Cdk1-Cyclin B, Plk1 and Nek6/7 to promote the breakdown of the nuclear envelope (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c117">Kutay et al, 2021</xref>). The <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocyte has the unusual feature of having an enormous nucleus (475 μm in diameter), and therefore a considerable surface area of the nuclear envelope (0.96 mm<sup>2</sup>), as well as large stocks of annulate lamellae in the cytoplasm. Annulate lamellae are cytoplasmic stack cisternae of nuclear envelope perforated with nuclear pores, 10 times more abundant than in the nucleus in the <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocyte, but devoid of lamins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Bement &amp; Capco, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c143">Miller &amp; Forbes, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Cordes et al, 1995</xref>). Their surface area also far exceeds that of the nuclear envelope surrounding the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Cordes et al, 1995</xref>). This correlates with the high protein concentrations of the nuclear pore proteins (0.1 to 0.7 μM) that we have measured (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A</xref>). Annulate lamellae play a critical role as a reservoir for the formation of the 4000 of nuclei that form during the embryonic cell divisions leading up to the mid-blastula transition and the onset of transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c103">Kessel et al, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">De Magistris &amp; Antonin, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Feldherr, 1974</xref>). During meiotic maturation, NEBD and vesiculation of annulate lamellae occur at the same time, in a progressive spatial manner, starting from the vegetal pole. Importantly, the nucleus and annulate lamellae do not re-form between the two meiotic divisions, reducing the risk that an S-phase can take place between MI and MII (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Bement &amp; Capco, 1990</xref>). A gene ontology analysis of our phosphoproteome highlights that the phosphorylation of nuclear pore components is enriched in Classes II, III and IV, displaying the highest level of enrichment in Class III, hence characteristic of MI (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7B</xref>). The nucleoporin Nup53 (also called Nup35) is a component of the soluble core region of the nuclear pore complex that is extensively phosphorylated in mitosis by Cdk1 and Plk1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c130">Linder et al, 2017</xref>). Phosphomimetic mutations of all Cdk1 and Plk1 sites in Nup53 slow down the reformation of nuclear pores in interphase and mutation to phospho-null amino acids impairs the nuclear breakdown during meiosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c130">Linder et al, 2017</xref>). Our phosphoproteome reveals that Nup53 phosphorylation is more dynamic than previously believed (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7C</xref>). Indeed, 6 phospho-peptides are found to peak in MI (Class III), 9 phospho-peptides are phosphorylated both in MI and MII (Class II), and 2 phospho-peptides continuously increase in phosphorylation during meiotic maturation (Class IV) (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7C</xref>). We were able to calculate the phospho-occupancy of the S59 (S66 in human), showing that it increases from 30% in prophase to 90% in MI oocytes and stays constant until MII (Class II) (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7D</xref>). Several other transmembrane nucleoporins, notably NDC1 and POM121C, undergo dramatic increase of phosphorylation at transition to MI. Altogether, these observations indicate that dissociation of the nuclear envelope and the annulate lamellae occurring in MI might require either a specific set of phosphorylations and/or a general level of phosphorylation that is higher than the level of phosphorylation required to maintain the nucleus and the annulate lamellae dissociated during the MI- MII transition through MII.</p>

<title>The regulation of centrosomal proteins during oocyte maturation</title>
<p>An intriguing feature of oocytes in most, if not all, metazoan species is the elimination of their centrioles. This allows the sperm to contribute its centriole and thereby initiates the division cycle and the cell cycle. There is longstanding literature that proves that the oocyte or egg has retained its ability to generate centrioles. However, in nature, the female centrioles are lost and the sperm centriole is the main contributor. In <italic>Xenopus</italic>, oocytes entering prophase I contain a typical centrosome, including a pair of centrioles and pericentriolar material (PCM) containing γ-tubulin and pericentrin. Centrioles disappear at the end of the pachytene stage of prophase I and PCM disperses in multiple foci in the cytoplasm that are no longer functional as microtubule nucleation sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Gard et al, 1995</xref>). At fertilization, the male gamete delivers two centrioles but does not provide the PCM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Delattre &amp; Gönczy, 2004</xref>). Therefore, in most species (with the exception of rodents), the complete centrosome of the one-cell stage embryo is a bi- parental inheritance, reconstituted from paternal centrioles and maternal PCM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Delattre &amp; Gönczy, 2004</xref>). In <italic>Xenopus</italic>, oocytes store enough quiescent centrosomal building blocks for duplicating and assembling 1000 to 2000 centrosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Gard et al, 1990</xref>). This implies that oocytes should comprise an enormous reserve of centrosomal proteins, <italic>i.e.</italic> centriolar and PCM proteins, that sustain the reconstitution of a functional centrosome at fertilization and its subsequent rounds of duplication in the early embryo.</p>
<sec id="s2k1">
<title>Centriolar proteins</title>
<p>The centriole is formed by a polarized cylinder of microtubule triplets, decorated along the proximal to distal axis with several appendages that define the three main regions of the organelle: the proximal part, the central core, and the distal region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c124">LeGuennec et al, 2021</xref>). In agreement with a published RNA-seq and proteome of <italic>Xenopus</italic> eggs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c186">Session et al, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c223">Wühr et al, 2014</xref>), our proteome reveals that most of the centriolar proteins are expressed in the oocyte (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).

In contrast, proteins of distal and subdistal appendages are present at lower concentration, either constant or decreasing during meiotic maturation (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).

<p>Besides the basic building blocks forming the centriole, the oocyte is expected to provide the machinery for its duplication, the first cycle occurring immediately after fertilization. The key regulators of centriole duplication, including Plk4, SAS-6 and STIL, are generally expressed at very low levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Bauer et al, 2016</xref>). While Plk4 is expressed at the mRNA level in oocytes but escaped our proteomic detection, SAS-6 and STIL are expressed at a constant level during meiotic maturation (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The estimated concentrations of both proteins are in agreement with the previous predictions, that cartwheels comprise one molecule of STIL for every SAS-6 dimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Bauer et al, 2016</xref>). Other important regulators of centriole duplication, such as CEP192, CEP152, CEP63, RTTN, CEP110/CCP110, CEP97 and CEP76 were also detected, and are either constant or accumulate during meiotic divisions (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Interestingly, our phosphoproteome reveals that several of these proteins are phosphorylated during meiotic maturation. STIL is phosphorylated at S554, which is located in a Cdk1 phosphorylation consensus (Appendix Figure S5A), an interesting observation since phosphorylation of STIL by Cdk1-Cyclin reduces the efficiency of daughter centriole assembly. This phosphorylation provides an explanation why centrioles cannot duplicate during M-phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c231">Zitouni et al, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c193">Steinacker et al, 2022</xref>). A massive CEP97 phosphorylation occurs at MI at 8 distinct sites, only 3 of them lying within a Cdk1 consensus motif (Appendix Figure S5B). Remarkably, one of the phosphosites of CEP97, S633, has been recently shown to be phosphorylated by the kinase Dyrk1a in multiciliated cells of <italic>Xenopus</italic> embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c122">Lee et al, 2022</xref>); it is required for centriole duplication. Therefore, although centrioles are not assembled, all centriolar proteins are expressed in the full-grown oocyte and these components serve as a stock for the biogenesis of the centrioles of the embryo. Our results suggest that specific phosphorylations of proteins regulating centriole assembly could prevent the <italic>de novo</italic> establishment of centrioles in the oocyte.</p>

<title>PCM proteins</title>
<p>The core element of the PCM is the γ-tubulin ring complex (γ-TuRC) which is the basic element for nucleation of microtubules from microtubule-organizing centers (MTOCs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c157">Oakley &amp; Oakley, 1989</xref>). It includes γ-tubulin that is combined with other proteins known as GCP2/tubgcp2 to GCP6/tubgcp6. Some PCM proteins or regulators of PCM assembly have been described in functional studies to be present in the oocyte and then recruited to the zygotic centrosome as maternal components. These include γ-tubulin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c191">Stearns &amp; Kirschner, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Gard, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Félix et al, 1994</xref>), pericentrin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Dictenberg et al, 1998</xref>), Nek2B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Fry et al, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c208">Uto, 2000</xref>), SSX2IP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Bärenz et al, 2013</xref>),TPX2, PRC1, Kif4A, Eg5/Kif11, CLASP1/Xorbit and Kif22/Xkid, CEP152 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Hatch et al, 2010</xref>), NEDD1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c131">Liu &amp; Wiese, 2008</xref>), Maskin/TACC3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c192">Stebbins-Boaz et al, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c165">Peset et al, 2005</xref>), XMAP215/CKAP5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c170">Popov et al, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c107">Kinoshita et al, 2002</xref>) and Nercc1/NEK9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c177">Roig et al, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Most of the PCM proteins were detected in our proteomic dataset and either accumulate or stay constant during meiotic divisions (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Our dataset highlights that γ-tubulin accumulates during meiotic divisions at the time the oocytes enter MII (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>-table supplement 1C). GCP2 and 4 are expressed at a lower level than γ-tubulin (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), in agreement with the expected stoichiometry of GCPs-γ-tubulin in the γ-TuRC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c194">Sulimenko et al, 2022</xref>). The phosphorylation of γ-TuRC components is known to affect the stability and the activation of the complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c194">Sulimenko et al, 2022</xref>). We detected the phosphorylation of GCP3 at S814 (Class IV) and GCP6 at S1173 (Class III) (Table 1-table supplement 1D). This second phosphosite is well conserved in the human protein and targeted by Plk4, which regulates centriole duplication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bahtz et al, 2012</xref>). These results indicate that the oocyte, despite the absence of centrioles, prepares a functional centrosomal machinery by accumulating and/or phosphorylating some of the PCM proteins. Apart of the γ-TuRC complex, we found that 10 other PCM proteins are phosphorylated during meiotic maturation (CEP192, SSX2IP, CEP41, TACC3/Maskin, Nucleophosmin, Katanin, Kif11, Kif15/Eg5, Numa and Dynein). CEP192 is a coiled-coil scaffolding protein that recruits γ- TuRC, Aurora-A and Plk1 to the centrosome for its maturation. Our phosphoproteome reveals that CEP192, a Class II protein, is phosphorylated at 7 sites between prophase and MI, 5 of them corresponding to Cdk1 phosphorylation sites (Table 1-table supplement 1E). Plk1 is recruited to its many different locations in the cell through its Polo-Box-Domain (PBD), which binds to phosphorylated S-S/T(p) motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Elia et al, 2003a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">2003b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c121">Lee et al, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c175">Reynolds &amp; Ohkura, 2003</xref>). Two of the CEP192 sites identified in our phosphoproteome, S991 and S1227, correspond to such motifs. Therefore, by attracting Plk1, CEP192 phosphorylation could prepare the reconstitution of a functional centrosome at fertilization.</p>

<title>Assembly of microtubule spindles and microtubule dynamics</title>
<p><italic>Xenopus</italic> prophase oocytes are inefficient in their ability to support microtubule polymerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c96">Jessus et al, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Gard &amp; Kirschner, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">Heidemann &amp; Kirschner, 1975</xref>), although microtubules are formed at the cortical and nuclear envelope level, where γ-tubulin foci are also localized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Gard, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c97">Jessus et al, 1988</xref>). The ability to assemble microtubule asters is acquired at the time of NEBD, when a giant disk- shaped MTOC generates a large microtubular monoaster at the basal region of the disintegrating nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">Huchon et al, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Gard, 1994</xref>). Therefore, MTOC and microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) must be finely regulated by post-translational modifications at time of NEBD. The transient microtubule monoaster transports the meiotic chromosomes to the animal cortex, where the first meiotic spindle is assembled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">Huchon et al, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Gard, 1992</xref>). Due to the absence of centrioles, meiotic spindles are barrel-shaped and are formed by centrosome-independent microtubule nucleation originating from the chromosomes and involving chromatin and the Ran GTPase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Gruss &amp; Vernos, 2004</xref>), much like spindles of vascular plant cells. Moreover, the two successive spindles are differentially regulated. The MI spindle is a transient and dynamic structure while the MII spindle is stable for hours, anchored to the plasma membrane until fertilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Gard, 1992</xref>). Therefore, it is possible that MAPs are specifically and differentially regulated at MI and MII (Classes III and V). Finally, a major change in microtubule assembly occurs during the transition from meiosis to embryonic mitosis. The assembly of the first embryonic spindle integrates the meiotic chromosome-dependent pathway with the newly formed centrosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Cavazza et al, 2016</xref>). Thereafter, subsequent embryonic spindles depend solely on the microtubule nucleating activity of the centrosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c109">Kirschner, 1986</xref>). All these critical transitions in the way of assembling a microtubular spindle depend on the proteins stored in the oocyte.</p>
<p>Many regulators of the microtubular spindle are highly regulated during meiotic divisions, both at level of their accumulation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B-C</xref>) and by post-translation modifications (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref>). At least 5 microtubule regulatory proteins undergo specific patterns of phosphorylation that deserve attention (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref>). Katanin (KATNB1), which is responsible for the majority of M-phase severing activity in <italic>Xenopus</italic> eggs and is activated by Cdk1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c139">McNally &amp; Thomas, 1998</xref>), displays a bi-modal pattern of phosphorylation, increasing at the time of formation of the monoaster-MTOC and MI spindle, decreasing during MI-MII transition and increasing again at MII (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref>). Kif11/Eg5 phosphorylation occurs at T936 and T937 starting NEBD (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref>). Both phosphosites were reported in a broad range of models, and the second site was shown to be phosphorylated by Cdk1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Blangy et al, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Cahu et al, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Giet et al, 1999</xref>) (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref>). Kif11/Eg5 controls the relative stability of bipolar versus monopolar organization of spindles in <italic>Xenopus</italic> egg extracts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c146">Mitchison et al, 2005</xref>) but also centrosome disjunction and/or separation. Hence, Kif11 is a good candidate to be an important player regulating the original changes in microtubule dynamics and organization of the two successive spindles. Kif15, also known as XKlp2, a plus end-directed kinesin protein required for centrosome separation and maintenance of spindle bipolarity in <italic>Xenopus</italic> egg extracts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Boleti et al, 1996</xref>), is phosphorylated at S681 and S692 during meiotic maturation. S681 is rather phosphorylated at MI while S692 is specific of MII (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref>), suggesting a potential distinct regulation of Kif15 on microtubule dynamics at MI and MII. In contrast to Kif11/Eg5 and Kif15, some kinesins from the kinesin- 14 family, such as Kifc1 whose protein level increases during meiotic divisions (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>), as well as dyneins, are motor proteins that move to microtubules in the opposite direction to kinesins. Among the dynein family, the two paralog genes dynein light intermediate chain (DynC1LI1 and DynC1LI2) play important roles in mitosis, including positioning the spindle and focusing the MTs into poles. Our phosphoproteome reveals multiple phosphorylations of these proteins, starting in MI and remaining constant or progressively increasing until MII, as for S197 of DynC1LI1 (S207 in human) (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref>). This agrees with previous data showing that S197 is phosphorylated by Cdk1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Dell et al, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Addinall et al, 2001</xref>) and that DynC1LI becomes hyperphosphorylated at the time of NEBD and remains hyperphosphorylated throughout the rest of meiosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">Huang et al, 1999</xref>). Additionally, our phosphoproteome reveals that 3 sites (495, 498 and 501) are phosphorylated around NEBD and get dephosphorylated after MI (Class III), hence being correlated with the 1<sup>st</sup> meiotic division and not the 2<sup>nd</sup> one, while 6 other sites (197,396, 409,446, 452, and 467) are phosphorylated both in MI and MII (Class II) (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref>). Dynein is required for organization of the original microtubule/MTOC array that is organized at NEBD, together with XMAP215, XKCM1 and Numa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Becker et al, 2003</xref>). The formation of this oocyte original monoaster/MTOC could involve the dynein phosphorylations that transiently take place precisely at this period.</p>

<p>Strikingly, MI and MII spindles segregate chromosomes and chromatids in a very different way. In MI, the homologous chromosomes are segregated, whereas in MII the sister chromatids are displaced in the daughter cells, due to a specific organization of kinetochores and regulation of cohesins. In MI, arm cohesins are phosphorylated and degraded whereas centromeric cohesins are protected from cleavage by Sugoshin (Sgo1)-PP2A. This allows the separation of chromosomes, but chromatids are still attached together. In MII, centromeric cohesins are fully degraded, allowing the segregation of sister chromatids, as during mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c216">Wassmann, 2022</xref>). How a fraction of cohesins is protected from cleavage in MI but not in MII is still not entirely clear since the phosphorylation of cohesins and their partners, which are not very abundant proteins, is difficult to be detected with conventional shotgun phosphoproteomics. Notably, our phosphoproteomic studies highlight new sites differentially phosphorylated between MI and MII within these proteins. Sgo1 and two components of the cohesin complex, Pds5b and Wapl, are increasingly phosphorylated during meiotic divisions (Class IV) (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>-table supplement 1E). Noteworthy, S1069 of Wapl is a putative Plk1 site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Grosstessner-Hain et al, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c104">Kettenbach et al, 2011</xref>).

<title>Evolutional conservation of the phospho-proteome between <italic>Xenopus</italic> and mouse</title>
<p>We compared our phosphoproteome to a dataset obtained during meiotic divisions in mouse oocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c195">Sun et al, 2024</xref>). We identified 408 phosphorylation sites present in both datasets (see Methods) (Appendix 7). These sites correspond to 320 <italic>Xenopus</italic> proteins and 277 mouse proteins. Note that when multiple mouse proteins share the same phospho-peptide sequence, they are grouped together in the mouse dataset. However, alignment with <italic>Xenopus</italic> data allows us to resolve which specific mouse protein is phosphorylated, thereby enriching the mouse dataset by leveraging information from <italic>Xenopus</italic> measurements. We then assessed whether the changes in phosphorylation between prophase and metaphase II were consistent between <italic>Xenopus</italic> and mouse meiotic maturation (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9A</xref>). Interestingly, the phosphorylation dynamics were significantly correlated between the two datasets (Pearson coefficient: 0.39, p &lt; 0.0001) (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9A</xref>). Furthermore, the changes in phosphorylation observed in <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes (range of the Log<sub>2</sub> Fold Change (MII/Pro): -4.27 and 7.03) were substantially greater than those measured in the mouse dataset (range of the Log<sub>2</sub>Fold Change(MII/Pro): -2.55 and 3.72), likely reflecting the higher dynamic range achieved by our workflow. Among the key phosphorylation events detected in both datasets are those involved in the activation of Cdk1 and the Mos/MAPK pathway. Notably, phosphorylation of Plk1 at T210 (mouse numbering, T201 in <italic>Xenopus</italic>), which is catalyzed by Aurora A and is critical for Plk1 activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c134">Macůrek et al, 2008</xref>), as well as phosphorylation of Gwl at S442 (mouse numbering, 467 in <italic>Xenopus</italic>), increased in both datasets (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figures 6B</xref> and <xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">9A-B</xref>). Similarly, both datasets consistently detected phosphorylation of Erk2 at T183 (mouse numbering, T188 in <italic>Xenopus</italic>), which reflects MEK-dependent activation of this kinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c164">Payne et al, 1991</xref>)(<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figures 6B</xref> and <xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">9A-B</xref>). Among the conserved sites whose phosphorylation increases during meiosis, several are known targets of Cdk1 and Erk/MAPK (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9B</xref>), consistent with the activation of these kinases during meiotic maturation. We experimentally confirmed the phosphorylation of Fak1 at S910, Erk2 at T188, and Plk1 at T201 by western blot (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9C</xref>). Moreover, by microinjecting the Cdk1-specific inhibitor Cip1 in oocytes in order to prevent Cdk1 activation, we demonstrated that Cdk1 is required for phosphorylation of all these substrates, whether they are direct targets of Cdk1 or Erk/MAPK (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9C</xref>). This aligns with previous reports indicating that MAPK pathway activation in oocytes occurs downstream of the initial activation of Cdk1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c184">Santoni et al, 2024</xref>). Interestingly, AKTS1/PRAS40 phosphorylation decreases during meiotic maturation in both species (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9A-B</xref>). We experimentally validated the dephosphorylation of AKTS1/PRAS40 at S208 and showed that this event occurs at NEBD and depends on Cdk1 activity (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9C</xref>). AKTS1/PRAS40 is a direct inhibitor of mTORC1 by competing with 4E-BP1 and S6K1 for binding to raptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c214">Wang et al, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c159">Oshiro et al, 2007</xref>). AKTS1/PRAS40 is phosphorylated on S184 (mouse numbering, S208 in <italic>Xenopus</italic>) by mTORC1, which leads to its dissociation from mTOR and enhances its ability to phosphorylate its substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c159">Oshiro et al, 2007</xref>). Interestingly, previous studies suggest that translation of ribosomal proteins, which are targets of mTOR signaling via the TOP motif located in their 5′-UTR, decreases during meiotic maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c133">Luong et al, 2020</xref>). Our findings support these observations and provide additional evidence for the downregulation of mTOR activity upon meiotic resumption.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The amphibian oocyte and egg have long been a source of inspiration and a source of experimental opportunity for important areas of biology, such as nuclear organization, spindle formation, cell polarity, fertilization, mitosis and meiosis, endocrine signaling and intracellular signal transduction. As experimental embryology gave way to genetic approaches in the late 20<sup>th</sup> century to study embryonic development, the attractiveness of amphibian oocytes declined.</p>
<p>The original advantages of the amphibian oocyte are now becoming more obvious, as it becomes important to link complex cellular processes, like cell division, to signal transduction. These processes are difficult to study because they occur at a single cell or even at subcellular level. Indeed, many important cell-division related processes involve transient changes occurring in specific compartments of the cell, like the endoplasmic reticulum, the mitotic apparatus, the nuclear and plasma membranes, or the cytoskeleton. Additionally, meiotic and mitotic divisions occupy a very short fraction of the life span of germ and somatic cells, making it hard to study them in cultured cells. Frog oocytes and eggs show exquisite synchrony of cell division, allowing to have large cohort of cells at the same stage of the cell cycle. Therefore, we and others have returned to the awesome power of the amphibian oocyte and egg to study the signal transduction, intracellular posttranslational changes surrounding the onset of meiotic and mitotic divisions and fertilization at a single cell level.</p>
<p>Importantly, the ingenious and sensitive tools developed to study the transcriptional regulation are of little use in the study of a cell type that does not transcribe RNA and of events that are regulated post-translationally, as meiotic and early embryonic divisions. For a long time, we lacked general tools for identification and measurement of the activity of the regulators of these processes, impairing our ability to connect the morphological changes previously described by histology to the respective molecular events. One manner to investigate these pathways is using pharmacological inhibitors, but their non- specificity and the complexity of pathways pose serious limitations. For years, phosphorylation events have been extensively studied using candidate-based approaches, as site-specific mutagenesis and phosphospecific antibodies. These targeted-approaches have several caveats. The selection of the putative sites of phosphorylation is based on <italic>in silico</italic> evidence, limiting the analysis to proteins bearing canonical consensus sequences and hence our knowledge of novel phosphorylation motifs. When multiple putative phosphorylation sites are present in the same protein, mutagenesis of individual sites or combinations of sites becomes too complex, impairing identification of the phosphorylation sites used <italic>in vivo</italic> and their interdependency or redundancy. Moreover, the time-consuming production of phospho - specific antibodies is not scalable to high throughput applications. Mass spectrometry has the potential of shedding light on these intricated networks. However, the current tools are unable to accurately quantify the level of proteins and phosphorylated proteins at the single cell level -except for the frog oocytes and eggs, thanks to their exceptional size and high protein content.</p>
<p>Oocyte meiotic maturation is a key biological process. First, it transforms the oocyte into a fertilizable cell at the origin of life of any animal. Second, since meiosis derives from mitosis, thanks to cellular adaptations that were necessary to produce a haploid gamete (preventing an S-phase between the two divisions, modifying the functioning of the spindle during meiosis I, establishing division arrests needed for the oocyte to grow or to wait for sperm, performing asymmetrical divisions to save nutrient reserves, etc.), its study provides the opportunity to understand how cell division can adapt and diversify in living systems, depending on specific cellular organization and specialized functions.</p>
<p>In this paper, we have applied the current state of the art of quantitative mass spectrometry to oocyte maturation and meiotic divisions using quantitative proteomics and quantitative phosphoproteomics. We have temporally correlated events with oocyte maturation induced naturally by progesterone to <italic>Xenopus</italic> full-grown oocytes and watched the progression through meiosis I to the natural arrest at the second meiotic metaphase. We have been able to correlate the proteomic measurements with the physiological changes as the oocyte, as it goes from an early prophase I state through to a second meiotic metaphase state. We find dramatic changes in the oocyte nucleus and the meiotic spindles and drastic modifications to the standard cell cycle. These dramatic changes are choreographed principally by signaling pathways employing kinases and phosphatases. In all animals, meiotic maturation relies on the dynamics of phosphorylation events, either during the signaling pathway that leads to Cdk1 activation or during the Cdk1 downstream period that orchestrates the structural events of the two meiotic divisions. The candidate-based approaches have provided a global scheme of this process based on the knowledge of a few kinases that have been extensively studied for years. However, this scheme still does not provide a very comprehensive picture of the meiotic process, since it does not take into account hundreds of unknown critical kinases, substrates and phosphosites. Our quantitative proteomics and phosphoproteomics approach allowed to obtain a much deeper and comprehensive dynamic picture of the phosphorylated sites during meiotic maturation. This has enabled us to describe and support with biochemical precision the various processes in the oocyte, determine the relative timing of various site phosphorylations and molecular processes, thereby challenging or suggesting the epistatic sequences of specific molecular pathways. Furthermore, we confirmed the importance of certain previously known phosphosites, identified the likely kinases or in some cases the kinase families responsible for substrate phosphorylation, and established connections between phosphorylation events and intracellular remodeling, as well as regulatory mechanisms such as translation and protein degradation.</p>
<p>In addition to explaining the order of diverse events of chromatin remodeling, nuclear organization, plasma membrane transformations, cytoskeletal changes of meiosis, our proteomic and phospho-proteomic datasets should provide a large number of experimental avenues for exploring similar events in both mitotic and meiotic stages of diverse organisms. This molecular data will enable us to better understand regulatory pathways involving chromosome behavior, spindle formation, nuclear and plasma membrane regulation, and signal transduction and derive insights far beyond the scope of meiosis and oocyte maturation. One such insight might come from a closer analysis of the quality control mechanisms in the oocyte. Both nucleopore remodeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c106">King et al, 2019</xref>) and E2/E3 ubiquitin ligases are involved in housekeeping and quality control, specifically in the removal of aggregated and orphan complex proteins, as the germ cell of an organism prepares to become the next generation</p>

The centrifugations were done in a JA 50 30 Ti rotor in a Beckman Avanti J-30I centrifuge at 21,000 g for either 6 minutes or 15 minutes. After the last supernatant was removed, the pellets were air dried for 15 minutes and resuspended in 0.6 mL of 6 M guanidine, 50 M EPPS pH 8.5 and transferred to a 2 mL Eppendorf tube. The samples were incubated for 5 minutes at 65°C and the protein amount was determined by a BCA Assay. The solution was diluted to 2 M guanidine with 10 mM EPPS pH 8.5. Lysyl endopeptidase (FUJIFILM WAKO (129-02541) resuspended with HPLC H<sub>2</sub>0 to ∼2 mg/mL) was added to a concentration of 20 ng/mL and the initial digestion proceeded for 12 hours at room temperature with gentle shaking. The samples were further diluted to 0.5 M guanidine with 10 mM EPPS pH 8.5 and Trypsin protease (Sequencing Grade Modified Trypsin, Promega) was added to a final concentration of 10 ng/mL along with an additional 20 ng/mL of LysC. The samples were incubated in a 37°C room for 8 hours on a nutator.</p>

<title>Phospho-peptide enrichment</title>
<p>To carry out the phosphoproteomic analysis, we made the conventional steps of digesting the proteins from each time sample with trypsin and specifically labeling them with isobaric tags (TMT-10 reagents). Tagged samples and the phosphor-peptides were enriched on an IMAC column. Importantly, we chose to multiplex peptides before the phosphor-peptide enrichment to improve data quality. There is a tradeoff of decreased yield and therefore depth, as it is not economical to label more than a few milligrams of material. We used 2.5-4 mgs of TMT-labeled peptides per replicate, enriched with 5 μm Titanium Dioxide microspheres (GL Sciences 5020-75000) and fractioned as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c171">Presler et al, 2017</xref>). A typical yield of 50-80 μg of peptides eluted from the column, with a median phosphor-peptide enrichment of ∼80%.</p>

<title>Phosphatase treatment of <italic>Xenopus</italic> samples prepared for parallel phospho-enrichment</title>
<p>We adapted the method that we used to phosphatase-treat digested peptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c171">Presler et al, 2017</xref>) for the larger samples used here for the parallel phospho-enrichment. We chose to phosphatase treat when proteases were present in the samples (but after the protease digestion sequence described above) to enable the de-phosphorylated peptides to have the cleavage pattern expected if they were present initially in the de-phosphorylated state. We used the heat-labile Alkaline Shrimp Phosphatase (Affymetrix Inc, USA). We used a 3k Amicon Centrifugal Filter to exchange the enzyme storage buffer to 10 mM EPPS pH 8.5 instead of Tris-HCl pH 7.5. We also concentrated the phosphatase to between 3-4 U/μL (confirmed by p-nitrophenyl phosphate assay). We added an estimated 833 units of phosphatase to two of the samples built to contain representative mixture of peptides (TMT 131N, channel 10: 100 oocytes collected at the latest timepoint, and TMT 131C, channel 11: 50 oocytes collected at the first timepoint combined with 50 oocytes collected at the last timepoint). To samples that were not phosphatase-treated, we added the same volume of blank phosphatase buffer: 5 mM EPPS pH 8, 50% glycerol. To all samples, we added MgCl<sub>2</sub> to 10 mM and EDTA to 0.1 mM (to chelate metals that might compete with the magnesium necessary for enzymatic activity). All the samples were incubated with gentle shaking at room temperature for 12 hours. The phosphatase was then inactivated by incubation with gentle shaking in an air-incubator at 65°C for 15 minutes. Peptide fractionation and TMT-MS3 LC/MS were carried out as done previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c171">Presler et al, 2017</xref>).</p>

<title>Computing phospho-occupancy systematically</title>
<p>To compute phospho-occupancy, we used the phospho_occupancy_matlab package, available as part of our code repository (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/elizabeth-van-itallie">https://github.com/elizabeth-van-itallie</ext-link>) implementing the methods previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c209">Van Itallie et al, 2025</xref>). We grouped phospho-peptides by unique phosphosite identifiers. In order to rigorously reflect the measurement accuracy and to take advantage of many measurements of the same phosphosite (including on peptides with different missed-cleavages or oxidized methionines), we used BACIQ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c166">Peshkin et al, 2019</xref>) to compute the estimated trend with confidence intervals. Then, we created phosphosite sets to connect phosphosites on residues that could be on the same peptide. We made these assignments based on whether the individual phosphosites were ever measured with another phosphosite as a composite phosphosite. In order to determine occupancy, we needed to measure the phosphosite as a different form (usually not-phosphorylated). To do this, we identified non- phosphorylated peptides measured from the same experimental conditions that include the residue(s) of the phosphosite. Again, multiple non-phosphorylated peptides can include the residues of interest and the same peptide sequences can be measured multiple times. Therefore, we again use BACIQ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c166">Peshkin et al, 2019</xref>) to aggregate these measurements in a trend with confidence intervals.</p>

<title>Mass spectrometry data mapping and analysis</title>
<p>Peptide-Spectra matches were performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c190">Sonnett et al, 2018</xref>). Assignment of MS2 spectra was performed using the SEQUEST (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Eng et al, 1994</xref>) algorithm by searching the data against the appropriate proteome reference set acquired from Xenbase (<italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> assembly 9.1) along with common contaminants: human keratins and trypsin. The target-decoy strategy was used to construct a second database of reversed sequences that were used to estimate the false discovery rate on the peptide level. SEQUEST searches were performed using a 20 ppm precursor ion tolerance with the requirement that both N- and C-terminal peptide ends are consistent with the protease specificities of LysC and Trypsin. TMT (+229.162932 Da) was set as a static modification on N-termini and lysines peptides, and N-ethyl maleimide (+125.047679 Da) was set as a static modification on cysteine residues. Oxidation of methionine (+15.99492 Da) was set as a variable modification. A peptide level MS2 spectral assignment false discovery rate of 1% was obtained by applying the target-decoy strategy with linear discriminant analysis. Peptides of 7 amino acids length or longer were ranked by linear discriminant analysis score and were filtered to a ratio of 1% reverses/forwards + reverses. Peptides were assigned to proteins and a second filtering step to obtain a 1% FDR on the protein level was applied. Peptides that matched multiple proteins were assigned to the proteins with the most unique peptides. We only used Isolation Specificity &gt; 0.75 spectra.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors analyzed Xenopus oocytes at different stages of meiosis using quantitative phosphoproteomics. Their advanced methods and analyses revealed changes in protein abundances and phosphorylation states to an unprecedented depth and quantitative detail. In the manuscript they provide an excellent interpretation of these findings putting them in the context of past literature in Xenopus as well as in other model systems. The clarity of these explanations improved significantly in the revised version of the manuscript, and several minor imprecisions have been corrected as well.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>High-quality data, careful and detailed analysis, and outstanding interpretation in the context of the large body of literature.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Merely a resource, none of the findings are tested in functional experiments.</p>
<p>I am very impressed by the quality of the data and the careful and detailed interpretation of the findings. In this form, the manuscript will be an excellent resource to the cell division community in general, and it presents a very large number of hypotheses that can be tested in future experiments. Xenopus has been and still is a popular and powerful model system that led to critical discoveries around countless cellular processes, including the spindle, nuclear envelope, and translational regulation, just to name a few. This also includes a huge body of literature on the cell cycle describing its phosphoregulation. It is indeed somewhat frustrating to see that these earlier studies using phospho-mutants and phospho-antibodies were just scratching the surface. The phosphoproteomics analysis presented here reveals much more extensive and much more dynamic changes in phosphorylation states. Thereby, in my opinion, this manuscript opens a completely new chapter in this line of research, setting the stage for more systematic future studies.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors performed time-resolved proteomics and phospho-proteomics in Xenopus oocytes from prophase I through the MII arrest of the unfertilized egg. The data contains protein abundance and phosphorylation sites of a large number set of proteins at different stages of oocyte maturation. The large sets of data are of high quality. In addition, the authors discussed several key pathways critical for the maturation. The data is very useful for researchers, not only researchers in Xenopus oocytes but also those in oocyte biology in other organisms.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The data of proteomics and phospho-proteomics in Xenopus oocyte maturation is very useful for future studies to understand molecular networks in oocyte maturation.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Although the authors offered molecular pathways of the phosphorylation in translation, protein degradation, cell cycle regulation, and chromosome segregation. The authors did not check the validity of the molecular pathways based on their proteomic data by experimentation. But this is not essential since this is a resource paper.</p>

<p>We would like to thank the reviewer for his/her positive feedback on our article. The public review points out that &quot;The manuscript could have benefitted from more comprehensive analyses and clearer writing.&quot; We have rewritten several sections and provided more detailed explanations of the analysis and interpretation of some data (see below for details). We have also followed all of the reviewer's recommendations, some of which specifically highlighted areas lacking clarity. We would also like to thank the reviewer for pointing out some errors, for which we apologize, and which have now been corrected. We sincerely appreciate the reviewer's thorough work, as it has greatly enhanced the clarity and precision of the manuscript.</p>

<p>We thank the reviewer for his/her extremely positive comments. The public review points out that &quot;none of the findings are tested in functional experiments.&quot; This is entirely accurate. We focused our work on obtaining the highest quality proteomic and phosphoproteomic data possible, and then sought to highlight these data by connecting them with existing functional data from the literature. This approach has opened up research avenues with enormous, previously unforeseen potential, in a wide range of biological fields (cell cycle, meiosis, oogenesis, embryonic development, cell biology, cellular physiology, signaling, evolution, etc.). We chose not to delay publication by experimentally investigating the narrow area in which we are specialists (meiotic maturation), while our data offer a vast array of research opportunities across various fields. Our goal was, therefore, to present this extensive dataset as a resource for different scientific communities, who can explore their specific biological questions using our data. This is why we submitted our article to the &quot;Repository&quot; section of eLife. Nevertheless, in the context of the comparative analysis of the mouse and <italic>Xenopus</italic> phosphoproteomes performed at the reviewer’s request, we felt it was important to complement this new section with functional experiments that not only validate the proteomic data but also provide new insights into certain proteins and their regulation by Cdk1 (new paragraph lines 824-860 and new Figure 9).</p>
<p>We are also grateful to the reviewer for the recommendation to improve the manuscript by including more comparisons between our <italic>Xenopus</italic> data and those from other systems. We have followed this suggestion (see below), which has significantly enriched the article (new paragraph lines 824-860 and new Figure 9).</p>

<p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p>
<p>(1) Fig. 1 -&gt; In the Figure legend &quot;mPRβ&quot; is called &quot;mPRb&quot;. In the Figure, it is indicated that PKA substrates are always activated by the phosphorylation. As the relevant substrates and the mode-of-action of the Arpp19 phosphorylation are not clear at the moment, this seems to be preliminary. It could for example also be conceivable that PKA phosphorylation inhibits a translation activator. In addition, the PG-dependent translation of RINGO/Speedy should be included in the model.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We fully agree with the reviewer. PKA substrates can either be activators of the Cdk1 activation pathway, which are inhibited by phosphorylation by PKA, or repressors of the same pathway, which are activated by phosphorylation by PKA. This is now illustrated in the new Fig. 1. In addition, we have also included RINGO/Speedy in the model and in the text (lines 78-79) and corrected &quot;mPRb&quot; in the legend.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) Lane 51-52 -&gt; it is questionable if the meiotic divisions can be called &quot;embryonic processes&quot;</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the reviewer comment, and we have removed the word “embryonic”.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) Lane 53 and lane 106-107 -&gt; recent data have indicated that transcription already starts during cell cycle 12 and 13 in most cells (e.g. Blitz and Cho: Control of zygotic genome activation in Xenopus (2021))</p>

<p>(10) Lane 360-363 -&gt; it is mentioned that APPL1 and Akt2 act &quot;to induce meiosis&quot;. Furthermore, in the Nader et al. 2020 paper, Akt2 phosphorylation is reported to happen within 30min after PG treatment. In the present work, they only seem to get phosphorylated when Cdk1 is activated. Is there an explanation for this discrepancy?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Indeed, Nader et al. (2020) indicate that Akt2 is phosphorylated on Ser473 (actually, they should have mentioned Ser474, which is the phosphorylated residue on Akt2; Ser473 corresponds to the numbering of Akt1) between 5 and 30 minutes post-Pg, which supports their hypothesis of an early role for this kinase. However, these conclusions should be taken with caution, considering that their functional experiment using antisense against Akt2 depletes only 25% of the protein, the antibody used to visualize Akt2 phosphorylation also recognizes phosphorylated Akt1 and Akt3, and they did not analyze phosphorylation of the protein after 30 minutes. Therefore, we cannot determine whether the level observed at 30 minutes represents a maximum or if it is just the onset of the phosphorylation that peaks later, possibly after activation of Cdk1, for example.</p>
<p>Regarding our measurements: we clearly observe phosphorylation of Akt2 following Cdk1 activation on Ser131. We did not detect Akt2 phosphorylation on Ser474, but since our measurements started 1 hour post-Pg, this protein may have returned to a dephosphorylated state on Ser474.</p>
<p>Therefore, the observations of Nader et al. and ours involve different residues and different phosphorylation kinetics, Nader et al. limiting their analysis to the first 30 minutes, whereas we started at 1 hour.</p>
<p>We have revised the manuscript text to make these aspects clearer (lines 387-392).</p>

We used SCF<sup>βTrCP</sup>, a wellstudied ubiquitin ligase in <italic>Xenopus</italic> and mouse oocytes during meiosis, as an example. SCF<sup>βTrCP</sup> regulates the degradation of several substrates, including Emi1, Emi2, CPEB1, and Btg4, whose degradation or stabilization is essential for the proper progression of meiosis.

<p>(17) Lane 564-565 -&gt; The authors state that Cdk1 activity can be measured by analyzing Cdc27 S428 phosphorylation. However, in vivo the net phosphorylation of a site is always depending on the relevant kinase and phosphatase activities. As S428 is a Cdk1 site, it is not unlikely that it is dephosphorylated by PP2A-B55, which by itself is under the control of Cdk1. Do the authors have direct evidence that the change in phosphorylation of S428 can only be attributed to the changes in Cdk1 activity?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>There is evidence in the literature that Cdc27 is dephosphorylated by PP2A (Torres et al., 2010). In <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes, PP2A activity is high during prophase (Lemonnier et al., 2021) and decreases at the time of Cdk1 activation, mediated by the Greatwall-ENSA/Arpp19 system, remaining low until MII (Labbé et al., 2021). Therefore, the period where fluctuations in Cdk1 activity are difficult to assess, from NEBD to MII, corresponds to a phase of inhibited PP2A activity. As a result, the phosphorylation level of Cdc27 reflects primarily the activity of Cdk1. We have added this clarification in the text (lines 597-600).</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p>
<p>While I find the manuscript excellent and detailed already in its current form, I would appreciate including even more comparisons to other systems. In particular, a similar phosphoproteomics experiment has been performed in starfish oocytes undergoing meiosis (Swartz et al, eLife, 2021), and there are several studies on mitosis of diverse mammalian cells. It would be very exciting to see to what extent changes are conserved.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for this recommendation, which we have attempted to follow. We have matched our dataset of mass spectrometry using the the phosphor-occupancy_matlab package, available as part of our code repository (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/elizabeth-van-itallie">https://github.com/elizabeth-van-itallie</ext-link>) previously described in (Van Itallie et al, 2025). Unfortunately, we were unable to match our dataset with the data from Swartz et al. (2021) on starfish oocyte due to the low sequence conservation. However, we have compared our dataset with the dataset from Sun et al. (2024) on mouse oocyte maturation. We identified a total of 408 conserved phosphorylation sites, which mapped to 320 proteins in <italic>Xenopus</italic> and 277 in mice (refer to a new paragraph: lines 824-860, new Figure 9, Methods: lines 1011-1032 and 1060-1065, and Appendix 7). The phosphorylation patterns during meiosis showed a significant crossspecies correlation (Pearson r = 0.39, p &lt; 0.0001; see new Figure 9A), demonstrating the evolutionary conservation of phosphoproteomic regulation. Important phosphorylation events, including Plk1 at T201, Gwl at S467, and Erk2 at T188, were upregulated in both species, in line with the activation of the Cdk1 and MAPK signaling cascades (Figure 6B, new Figure 9A-B). We validated several of these phosphorylation sites by western blotting and demonstrated their dependency on Cdk1 activation (new Figure 9C). Together, these findings reinforce the notion that fundamental phospho-regulatory pathways are conserved during oocyte maturation in vertebrates.</p>

<p>Our phosphosites dataset contains 80% Ser, 19.9% Thr, and 0.01% Tyr.

The same observation was made regarding the distribution of phosphorylated amino acids in mouse oocytes, where phospho-Tyr abundance is relatively diminished in oocytes compared to mouse organs (Sun et al., 2024).

<p>(3) In class II (Figure 3), when Cdk1 (line 326) is a major kinase, how many phosphorylation sites are a target of Cdk1 (with the Cdk1-motif)? Moreover, do the authors find any other consensus sequences for the phosphorylation? Those are either known or unknown. This information would be useful for the readers.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for this valuable comment. To address it, we used the kinase prediction server (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://kinase-library.phosphosite.org/kinase-library/score-site">https://kinase-library.phosphosite.org/kinase-library/score-site</ext-link>) to analyze Class II phosphosites. These new results are mentioned in lines 340-349 and illustrated in a new Figure (Figure 3—figure supplement 1A). We identified 303 sites predicted to be phosphorylated by Cdk1. Of these, 166 were also predicted as Erk1/2 targets, reflecting the similarity between Cdk1 and Erk1/2 consensus motifs.</p>
<p>Cdk1 substrate phosphorylation is governed by more than just the presence of a consensus sequence. In addition to its preference for the (S/T)P×(K/R) motif, Cdk1/cyclin complexes achieve specificity through docking interactions with short linear motifs (SLiMs) recognized by the cyclin subunit (as LxF motifs)(Loog &amp; Morgan, 2005), and via the Cdk-binding subunits Cks1 or Cks2, which interact with phosphorylated threonine residues in primed substrates (Örd et al, 2019). These mechanisms promote processive multisite phosphorylation and allow Cdk1 to target substrates even at non-canonical sites. Our motif-based analysis captures only part of this complexity and may underestimate the number of true Cdk1 targets.</p>
<p>To further explore kinase involvement across phosphosite classes, we extended the analysis to all clusters and identified the most enriched kinase predictions for each (lines 360-365, new Figure 3— figure supplement 1B). In Class II, the most enriched kinases included Cdk1, Erk2, and Plk1, supporting the conclusions derived from the identification of the phosphosites of this Class. But others such as Cdk2, Cdk3, Cdk5, Cdk16, KIS, JNK1, and JNK3 were also identified.</p>

<p>(4) Figure 3B: Why do the authors show this kind of Table only for Class I, not Classes II-V? It would be informative to show candidate proteins in other classes.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We chose to present the candidate proteins from Class I in a table format because the number of phosphosites (136) was too small to allow a meaningful Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis. Therefore, we manually curated the data and highlighted proteins whose Class I phosphosites are associated with specific biological processes. For Classes II–V, the higher number of phosphosites allowed us to perform GO enrichment analyses. Since several of the enriched processes were shared across different classes, and some proteins have phosphosites in multiple classes, we opted to organize the results by biological processes rather than by class. We agree with the reviewer that it is indeed valuable to highlight interesting proteins with Class II–V phosphosites. We have done so in Figures 4 through 8, using graphical representations instead of tables, in order to make the data more accessible and avoid long tables. Additionally, the Supplementary Figures provide detailed phosphorylation trends for many of the proteins discussed in the main figures.</p>

Phosphorylation dynamics across meiosis were significantly correlated between the species (Pearson r = 0.39, p &lt; 0.0001; new Figure 9A), highlighting evolutionary conservation of the phosphoproteomes. Key phosphorylation events such as Plk1 at T201, Gwl at S467, and Erk2 at T188 increased in both species, consistent with activation of the Cdk1 and MAPK pathways (Figure 6B, new Figure 9A–B). We validated experimentally several of these phosphorylation sites by western blot (Erk2, Plk1, Fak1 and Akts1) and demonstrated their dependency on Cdk1 activation (new Figure 9C).
