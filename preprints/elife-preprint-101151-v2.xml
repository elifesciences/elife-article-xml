<title>Abstract</title><p>Biomechanical cues play an essential role in sculpting organ formation. Comprehending how cardiac cells perceive and respond to biomechanical forces is a biological process with significant medical implications that remains poorly understood. Here we show that biomechanical forces activate endocardial <italic>id2b</italic> (inhibitor of DNA binding 2b) expression, thereby promoting cardiac contractility and valve formation. Taking advantage of the unique strengths of zebrafish, particularly the viability of embryos lacking heartbeats, we systematically compared the transcriptomes of hearts with impaired contractility to those of control hearts. This comparison identified <italic>id2b</italic> as a gene sensitive to blood flow. By generating a knockin reporter line, our results unveiled the presence of <italic>id2b</italic> in the endocardium, and its expression is sensitive to both pharmacological and genetic perturbations of contraction. Furthermore, <italic>id2b</italic> loss-of-function resulted in progressive heart malformation and early lethality. Combining RNA-seq analysis, electrophysiology, calcium imaging, and echocardiography, we discovered profound impairment in atrioventricular (AV) valve formation and defective excitation-contraction coupling in <italic>id2b</italic> mutants. Mechanistically, deletion of <italic>id2b</italic> reduced AV endocardial cell proliferation and led to a progressive increase in retrograde blood flow. In the myocardium, <italic>id2b</italic> directly interacted with the bHLH component <italic>tcf3b</italic> (transcription factor 3b) to restrict its activity. Inactivating <italic>id2b</italic> unleashed its inhibition on <italic>tcf3b</italic>, resulted in enhanced repressor activity of <italic>tcf3b</italic>, which subsequently suppressed the expression of <italic>nrg1</italic> (neuregulin 1), an essential mitogen for heart development. Overall, our findings identify <italic>id2b</italic> as an endocardial cell-specific, biomechanical signaling-sensitive gene, which mediates intercellular communications between endocardium and myocardium to sculpt heart morphogenesis and function.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The heart develops with continuous contraction, and biomechanical cues play an essential role in cardiac morphogenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. Blood flow is directly sensed by the surrounding endocardium, which undergoes multiscale remodeling during zebrafish heart development. In the atrioventricular canal (AVC) endocardium, oscillatory flow promotes valvulogenesis through transient receptor potential (TRP) channel-mediated expression of Krüppel-like factor 2a (<italic>klf2a</italic>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. Meanwhile, mechanical forces trigger ATP-dependent activation of purinergic receptors, inducing expression of nuclear factor of activated T cells 1 (<italic>nfatc1</italic>) and subsequent valve formation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>. In the chamber endocardium, blood flow induces endocardial cells to adopt chamber- and region-specific cell morphology during cardiac ballooning<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. A recent study further emphasized that blood flow is essential for endocardial cell accrual in assembling the outflow tract<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. Beyond their role in endocardial cells, proper biomechanical cues are indispensable for shaping the myocardium. For instance, in contraction compromised <italic>tnnt2a</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup> and <italic>myh6</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup> mutants, trabeculation is markedly reduced. Moreover, apart from the tissue-scale regulatory effect, the shape changes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup> and myofibril content<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup> at the single-cardiomyocyte level are also sculpted by the interplay of contractility and blood flow in the developing heart.</p>
<p>In ventricular myocardium morphogenesis, biomechanical forces coordinate intra-organ communication between endocardial and myocardial cells by regulating BMP, Nrg/Erbb, and Notch signaling. The Nrg-Erbb axis stands as one of the most extensively studied signaling pathway mediating cell-cell communications in the heart<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. In particular, endocardial Notch activity induced by cardiac contraction promotes the expression of Nrg, which then secretes into the extracellular space, binding to Erbb2/4 receptor tyrosine kinases on cardiomyocyte and promoting their delamination<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. In agreement with the pivotal role of this signaling pathway in heart development, genetic mutations in zebrafish <italic>nrg2a</italic> and <italic>erbb2</italic> result in severely compromised trabeculae formation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>The development of cardiomyocytes encompasses the specification of subcellular structure, metabolic state, gene expression profile, and functionality<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>. The rhythmic contraction of cardiomyocytes relies on precisely regulated excitation-contraction coupling (E-C coupling), transducing electrical activity into contractile forces. This intricate signaling cascade involves membrane action potential, calcium signaling, and sarcomeric structure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>. Specifically, membrane depolarization triggers the opening of L-type calcium channel (LTCC), allowing calcium influx. The calcium signaling then activates the ryanodine receptor on the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) membrane, releasing additional calcium<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>. E-C coupling is essential for heart development, as evidenced by the complete silence of the ventricle and reduced cardiomyocyte number in <italic>cacna1c</italic> (LTCC α1 subunit in zebrafish) mutant<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>. Beyond its role in modulating cardiac structure formation, previous studies indicate that Nrg-Erbb2 signaling is also necessary for cardiac function, as <italic>erbb2</italic> mutants exhibit severely compromised fractional shortening and an immature conduction pattern<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Id (inhibitor of DNA binding) proteins belong to the helix-loop-helix (HLH) family and function as transcriptional repressors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>. Notably, Id2 lacks a DNA-binding domain and forms heterodimer with other bHLH proteins, acting in a dominant-negative manner<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>. Id2 plays a crucial role in heart development, and its genetic deletion results in severe cardiac defects in mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>. In zebrafish, <italic>id2a</italic> and <italic>id2b</italic> are homologs of the mammalian <italic>Id2</italic> gene. However, their expression pattern and function in the zebrafish heart remains largely unknown. In the present study, we identified that <italic>id2b</italic> is specifically expressed in endocardial cells of the developing heart, and its expression is regulated by cardiac contraction and blood flow. Genetic deletion of <italic>id2b</italic> led to impaired AV valve formation and reduced cardiac contractility. Therefore, <italic>id2b</italic> serves as a crucial mediator linking biomechanical cues to heart morphogenesis.</p>

<title>Transcriptome analysis identifies <italic>id2b</italic> as a blood flow sensitive gene</title>
<p>Blood circulation is dispensable for early embryonic development in zebrafish, presenting an ideal model to investigate biomechanical cues influencing heart morphogenesis. To identify genes affected by cardiac contraction or blood flow, we treated <italic>myl7:mCherry</italic> zebrafish embryos with tricaine to inhibit cardiac contractility from 72 hours post-fertilization (hpf) to 96 hpf. Hearts from control and tricaine-treated zebrafish embryos were manually collected under a fluorescence stereoscope as previously reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>. Subsequently, approximately 1,000 hearts from each group were subjected to RNA sequencing (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). A total of 4,530 genes with differential expression were identified, comprising 2,013 up-regulated and 2,517 down-regulated genes. With a specific focus on identifying key transcription factors (TFs) affected by perturbing biomechanical forces, differentially expressed genes (DEGs) encoding TFs were enriched into signaling pathways through KEGG analysis.</p>

<p>Interestingly, our analysis identified several pathways known to be involved in heart development, including the transforming growth factor beta (TGFβ) signaling and Notch signaling pathways (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). In particular, the scaled expression levels of the top 6 DEGs (|log<sub>2</sub>FC| ≥ 0.585), exhibiting up- or down-regulation, were listed (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). Intriguingly, <italic>Id2</italic> has been shown to regulate murine AV valve formation, a process notably influenced by alterations in blood flow directionality. Moreover, loss of <italic>Id2</italic> leads to malformation of both the arterial and venous poles of the heart and disrupts AV valve morphogenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>. Therefore, we interrogated the expression and function of <italic>id2b</italic> in developing embryos.</p>
<p>Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis of purified embryonic hearts revealed a significant reduction in <italic>id2b</italic> mRNA levels and an increase in <italic>id2a</italic> levels following tricaine treatment from 72 to 96 hpf compared to controls (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>). Furthermore, in situ hybridization was performed to visualize <italic>id2b</italic> expression under tricaine or 10 µM blebbistatin (an inhibitor of sarcomeric function and cardiac contractility) treatment from 48 to 72 or from 72 to 96 hpf as previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Consistently, our results showed a reduction in <italic>id2b</italic> signal in contraction-deficient hearts compared to the control (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>). In cardiomyocytes, <italic>tnnt2a</italic> encodes a key sarcomeric protein essential for contractility. Similarly, injection of a previously characterized <italic>tnnt2a</italic> morpholino<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup> at the 1-cell stage also led to compromised contraction and diminished expression of <italic>id2b</italic> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>). Taken together, these results indicate that biomechanical cues are essential for activating <italic>id2b</italic> in embryonic hearts.</p>

<p>Due to technical challenges in visualizing the cell-type-specific expression of <italic>id2b</italic> in the developing heart using whole-mount in situ hybridization, we employed an intron targeting-mediated approach<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup> to generate a knockin <italic>id2b:eGFP</italic> reporter line.

<p>To further elucidate the spatiotemporal expression of <italic>id2b</italic> in developing hearts, we crossed <italic>id2b:eGFP</italic> with <italic>myl7:mCherry</italic> or <italic>kdrl:mCherry</italic>, labelling cardiomyocytes or endocardial cells, respectively.

<p>We then explored how cardiac contraction modulated <italic>id2b</italic> expression. Given that endocardial cells can sense blood flow through primary cilia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>, we used a characterized morpholino<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup> to knockdown <italic>ift88</italic>, an intraflagellar transporter essential for primary cilia formation. Previously work demonstrated a complete loss of primary cilia in endocardial cells upon <italic>ift88</italic> knockdown<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>. As expected, a significant decrease in <italic>id2b:eGFP</italic> intensity was observed in the chamber and AVC endocardium of <italic>ift88</italic> morphants compared to control (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>, D), suggesting that biomechanical forces promote the expression of <italic>id2b</italic> via primary cilia. In the developing heart, a central hub for mediating biomechanical cues is the Klf2 gene, which includes the <italic>klf2a</italic> and <italic>klf2b</italic> paralogues in zebrafish<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>. Previous studies in mammals and zebrafish have highlighted the essential role of Klf2 transcription factor activity in cardiac valve and myocardial wall formation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>. As a flow- responsive gene, <italic>klf2a</italic> expression has been observed throughout the entire endocardium, evidenced by mRNA expression and transgenic studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>. Interestingly, in situ hybridization on 48 and 72 hpf <italic>klf2a<sup>-/-</sup></italic>and <italic>klf2b<sup>-/-</sup></italic> embryos unveiled a drastic decrease in <italic>id2b</italic> expression compared with wild-type zebrafish (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>), supporting the notion that <italic>klf2</italic>-mediated biomechanical signaling is essential for activating <italic>id2b</italic> expression.</p>
<p>Given that <italic>id2b</italic> has been reported as a target gene of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling, we explored whether BMP also played a role in regulating <italic>id2b</italic> expression. To this end, we knocked down <italic>bmp2b</italic>, <italic>bmp4</italic>, and <italic>bmp7a</italic> in 1-cell stage embryos. Live imaging at 24 hpf revealed a significant reduction in <italic>id2b:eGFP</italic> fluorescence signal in morpholino-injected hearts compared to controls (Figure 3-figure supplement 1A, B), suggesting that <italic>id2b</italic> is a target gene of BMP signaling during early embryonic development. Similarly, treatment with the BMP inhibitor Dorsomorphin from 10 to 24 hpf resulted in a marked decrease in <italic>id2b:eGFP</italic> signal (Figure 3-figure supplement 1C, D). Considering that heartbeats in zebrafish commence at approximately 22 hpf, we treated embryos with Dorsomorphin from 24 to 48 hpf or from 36 to 60 hpf. While the number of endocardial cells was slightly reduced upon Dorsomorphin exposure as previously reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>, surprisingly, quantification of the average <italic>id2b:eGFP</italic> fluorescence intensity in individual endocardial cells revealed no significant differences between Dorsomorphin and DMSO-treated controls (Figure 3-figure supplement 1C, D).</p>
<p>We further visualized BMP activity using the <italic>BRE:d2GFP</italic> reporter line. Confocal images revealed strong fluorescence in the myocardium at 72 hpf, with minimal signal present in the endocardium except for the AVC endothelium (Figure 3-figure supplement 1E). Moreover, after tricaine treatment, endocardial <italic>BRE:d2GFP</italic> slightly increased (Figure 3-figure supplement 1E), as opposed to the reduced <italic>id2b:eGFP</italic> signal (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A, B</xref>). Likewise, endocardial <italic>BRE:d2GFP</italic> intensity was barely affected after completely blocking contraction with <italic>tnnt2a</italic> MO injection (Figure 3-figure supplement 1E). These observations align with previous work using pSmad-1/5/8 as a readout of BMP activity, indicating that endocardial BMP signaling is independent of blood flow<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. Collectively, these results suggest that <italic>id2b</italic> expression is regulated by both BMP and biomechanical signaling, with the relative contribution of each pathway varying across developmental stages.</p>

<title>Compromised AV valve formation in <italic>id2b</italic> mutants</title>
<p>To investigate the role of the contractility-<italic>id2b</italic> axis in zebrafish heart development, we generated a loss-of-function mutant line using CRISPR/Cas9. A pair of sgRNAs designed to target exon 1 was injected with zCas9 protein into 1-cell-stage embryos. Consequently, we identified a mutant allele with a 157 bp truncation, leading to the generation of a premature stop codon (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>, left). In <italic>id2b</italic> mutants (<italic>id2b<sup>-/-</sup></italic>), the expression levels of <italic>id2b</italic> were significantly decreased, while <italic>id2a</italic> expression levels were increased compared to <italic>id2b<sup>+/+</sup></italic> siblings (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A, right</xref>). The overall morphology of <italic>id2b<sup>-/-</sup></italic>remained unaltered at 72 and 96 hpf (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>). However, <italic>id2b<sup>-/-</sup></italic> zebrafish experienced early lethality starting around 31 weeks post-fertilization (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>).

Histological analysis further revealed malformation in the AV valves of these <italic>id2b<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mutants compared to controls (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E, right</xref>).

<p>To further interrogate the effect of <italic>id2b</italic> inactivation on AV valve formation and function, we analyzed the number of AVC endothelial cells using <italic>kdrl:nucGFP</italic>.

<p>Additionally, we performed echocardiography to analyze blood flow in adult zebrafish as previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>.

<p>Interestingly, <italic>id2b</italic> inactivation also impacted phenotypes such as cardiac muscle contraction and heart contraction (Figure 5-figure supplement 1B). Therefore, we investigated cardiac contractile function through time-lapse imaging on the <italic>myl7:mCherry</italic> background. At 72 and 120 hpf, a significant decrease in cardiac function was observed in <italic>id2b<sup>-/-</sup></italic>compared with <italic>id2b<sup>+/+</sup></italic> (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A-C</xref>, Figure 5-figure supplement 2A-C).

These functional defects in <italic>id2b</italic>-deleted hearts could not be attributed to differences in cardiomyocyte number, as we counted cardiomyocytes using the <italic>myl7:H2A-mCherry</italic> line and found no apparent changes between <italic>id2b<sup>-/-</sup></italic> and <italic>id2b<sup>+/+</sup></italic> embryos at 72 and 120 hpf (Figure 5-figure supplement 2D, E). Similarly, <italic>id2b<sup>-/-</sup></italic> also developed regular trabecular structures (Figure 5-figure supplement 2F).

<p>The key functional unit that transmits electrical activity to contractile function is E-C coupling.

<p>To understand how the altered interaction between <italic>id2b</italic> and <italic>tcf3b</italic> influences <italic>nrg1</italic> expression, we analyzed the promoter region of zebrafish <italic>nrg1</italic> using JASPAR and identified two potential <italic>tcf3b</italic> binding sites (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7C</xref>). Subsequently, a DNA fragment containing the zebrafish <italic>nrg1</italic> promoter region was subcloned into a vector carrying the luciferase reporter gene.

<p>Conversely, co-injection with a previously characterized <italic>tcf3b</italic> morpholino led to enhanced luciferase intensity (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7D</xref>).

<p>Lastly, injecting <italic>tcf3b</italic> morpholino into <italic>id2b<sup>-/-</sup></italic>embryos was performed to assess whether attenuating the overactive <italic>tcf3b</italic> in <italic>id2b<sup>-/-</sup></italic> could restore the expression level of <italic>nrg1</italic>. qRT-PCR analysis of purified 72 hpf hearts revealed a partial restoration of the diminished <italic>nrg1</italic> expression in <italic>id2b<sup>-/-</sup></italic> upon <italic>tcf3b</italic> inhibition (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7E</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Biomechanical forces play an essential role in regulating the patterning and function of the heart. At AVC, oscillatory flow promotes the expression of <italic>klf2a</italic> and <italic>nfatc1</italic> to modulate valve morphogenesis. In chamber endocardium, blood flow induces endocardial cells to acquire distinct cell morphology. However, it still lacks a systematic analysis of the transcriptome underlying compromised heartbeats. In the present study, we analyzed embryonic zebrafish hearts without contractility and identified genes that are regulated by biomechanical forces. Specifically, our results unveiled the endocardial-specific expression of <italic>id2b</italic>, which was tightly regulated by flow-sensitive primary cilia-<italic>klf2</italic> axis. Genetic deletion of <italic>id2b</italic> resulted in compromised valve formation and progressive atrium enlargement. In addition, a reduction in heart rate and contractile force was observed in <italic>id2b<sup>-/-</sup></italic>, owing to decreased expression of LTCC α1 subunit <italic>cacna1c</italic>. Mechanistically, <italic>id2b</italic> interacts with bHLH transcription factor <italic>tcf3</italic>b to limit its repressor activity. Hence genetic deletion of <italic>id2b</italic> unleashes <italic>tcf3</italic>b activity, which further represses endocardial <italic>nrg1</italic> expression. As a result, Injection of <italic>nrg1</italic> mRNA partially rescues the phenotype of <italic>id2b</italic> deletion. Overall, our findings identify <italic>id2b</italic> as a novel mediator that regulate the interplay between endocardium and myocardium during heart development.</p>
<p>In mammals, the deletion of <italic>Id2</italic> leads to malformations in the arterial and venous poles of the heart, as well as affects AV valve morphogenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>. Interestingly, approximately 20% perinatal lethality is reported in <italic>Id2</italic> knockout mice, exhibiting AV septal defects and membranous ventricular septal defects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>. Remarkably, pericardial edema is evident in 20% of adult <italic>id2b<sup>-/-</sup></italic> zebrafish, with a prominent enlargement of the atrium. The superior and inferior leaflets of AV valves in <italic>id2b<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mutants are significantly thinner compared to the control. Therefore, our results suggest that <italic>id2b</italic> may play a similar role in regulating AV valve formation in zebrafish as its mammalian orthologue <italic>Id2</italic>. It is proposed that the loss of <italic>Id2</italic> in mice results in compromised endocardial proliferation and aberrant endothelial-to mesenchymal transformation (EMT), collectively leading to defective valve morphogenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>. Nevertheless, the mechanism by which <italic>id2b</italic> loss-of-function causes a reduction in leaflet thickness in zebrafish remains to be determined in future studies.</p>
<p><italic>id2b</italic> has been recognized as a target gene of the BMP signaling pathway. As expected, knockdown of <italic>bmp2b</italic>, <italic>bmp4</italic>, and <italic>bmp7a</italic> at 1-cell stage confirms that endocardial <italic>id2b</italic> expression is controlled by BMP activity during early embryonic development. Surprisingly, treatment with the BMP inhibitor Dorsomorphin at 24 and 36 hpf, when cardiac contractions have already initiated, fails to alter <italic>id2b</italic> expression in the endocardium, suggesting that BMP is dispensable for <italic>id2b</italic> activation at these stages. Instead, endocardial <italic>id2b</italic> expression is reduced upon loss-of-function of <italic>klf2a</italic>, <italic>klf2b</italic>, and <italic>ift88</italic>, suggesting an essential role of the primary cilia-<italic>klf2</italic> axis in mediating <italic>id2b</italic> activation. In endocardial cells, Trp, Piezo, and ATP-dependent P2X/P2Y channels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></sup> are well-established sensors for biomechanical stimulation. The activation of these channels further promotes the activities of Klf2 and Nfatc1 to drive heart development and valvulogenesis. However, whether these channels are also required for the activation of <italic>id2b</italic> warrants further investigation.</p>
<p>The Nrg-Erbb signaling plays an essential role in regulating heart morphogenesis and function. In the mammalian heart, the genetic deletion of Nrg1 or Erbb2 results in severely perturbed cardiac trabeculae formation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. Zebrafish <italic>erbb2</italic> mutants exhibit a similar defect in cardiomyocyte proliferation and trabeculation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. Interestingly, <italic>nrg1</italic> mutant zebrafish display grossly normal cardiac structure during early embryonic devolpment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref></sup>. Nevertheless, zebrafish <italic>nrg2a</italic> loss-of-function leads to defective trabeculae formation, suggesting that <italic>nrg2a</italic> is the predominant ligand secreted from endocardium, promoting ventricular morphogenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. In the adult stage, perivascular cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref></sup> or regulatory T cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref></sup>-derived <italic>nrg1</italic> promotes cardiomyocyte proliferation during heart regeneration.</p>
<p>Hence, the specific ligand/receptor and the spatiotemporal regulation of the Nrg-Erbb axis appear to be more complicated in both embryonic and adult zebrafish. Interestingly, the <italic>nrg1</italic> mutant heart exhibits a defect in cardiac nerve expansion and heart maturation at the juvenile stage despite normal cardiac structure formation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref></sup>, suggesting its potential role in regulating cardiac function. Our findings demonstrate that the expression of <italic>nrg1</italic> in embryonic endocardial cells is influenced by biomechanical cues and <italic>id2b</italic> activity. This signaling axis is essential for coordinating endocardium-myocardium interaction and establishing proper cardiac function.</p>

Next, a donor plasmid containing the sgRNA targeting sequence of the intron, exon 2 of <italic>id2b</italic>, and P2A-eGFP was generated. Co-injection of sgRNA, donor plasmid, and zCas9 protein into one-cell stage embryos led to concurrent cleavage of the sgRNA targeting sites in both the zebrafish genome and the donor plasmid (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>).

<title>Co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) and western blot</title>
<p>Zebrafish <italic>tcf3b</italic> and <italic>id2b</italic> were overexpressed in 293T cell for 48 hours. The transfected cells were then collected and lysed using IP lysis buffer (Sangon Biotech, C500035) containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors (Sangon Biotech, C510009, C500017). For the IP experiment, anti-Flag antibody (Cell Signaling Technology, 14793, 1:100) and IgG antibody (ABclonal, AC005, 1:100) was incubated with cell lysates overnight at 4°C. Pretreated magnetic beads were bound with the antigen- antibody complex for 4 hours at 4°C, followed by washing with IP lysis buffer three times. For western blot, samples were denatured at 95°C for 10 min, separated on a 5%-12% gradient gel. Proteins were then transferred to a PVDF membrane (Sigma, ISEQ00010). The membrane was blocked for 1 hour with 5% nonfat milk or 5% BSA (Sangon Biotech) dissolved in TBST and then incubated with primary antibodies (anti-FLAG, Cell Signaling Technology, 14793, 1:1000; anti-HA, Sigma, H3663, 1:1000) overnight at 4°C, followed by three times 10-min TBST washes. HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies (Invitrogen, 31430, 31460) were incubated for 1 hour at room temperature, followed by three times 10- min TBST washes. The detection of immunoreactive bands was performed with a chemiluminescent substrate (Thermo Scientific, 34577) and imaged using the Azure Biosystems 400.</p>

<title>Immunofluorescence</title>
<p>For immunofluorescence on adult zebrafish hearts, we fixed the hearts overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde at 4 L, followed by equilibration through 15% and 30% sucrose in PBS solution. The hearts were embedded and frozen in O.C.T. compound (Epredia, 6502), and 10 μm thick cryosections were prepared using a CryoStar NX50 cryostat. Immunofluorescence experiments were performed as previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref></sup>. For immunofluorescence on embryonic hearts, embryos were fixed overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde at 4, washed twice quickly in 100% methanol, and then dehydrated overnight at -20L in 100% methanol. Subsequently, rehydration was performed through a methanol gradient (100%, 75%, 50%, 25%, 10 min each), followed by three times washes in PBST (1% PBS/0.1% Triton-X100, 10 min each). The embryos were treated with 10 μg/mL proteinase K diluted in PBST for 20 min at room temperature, re-fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min, washed in PBST, and immersed in blocking solution (PBST/1% BSA/2% goat serum) for 1 hour at room temperature. Following this, the embryos were incubated in the primary antibody diluted in blocking solution overnight at 4L. After washing in PBST, they were incubated in the secondary antibody (1:200) for 2 hours at room temperature. The primary antibody used was: Anti-GFP antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc9996, 1:200), anti-α-actinin antibody (Sigma, A7811, 1:200). The secondary antibody used was: Anti-mouse IgG-Alexa 488 (Invitrogen, A11011, 1:400). DAPI was used to stain cell nuclei.</p>

<title>Cardiac function analysis</title>
<p>To assess cardiac function in embryonic hearts, embryos were incubated in 0.16 mg/mL tricaine (Sigma, A5040) and embedded in 1% low melting agarose. Heart contractions were recorded for 1 min using a Nikon Ti2 microscope at a rate of 25 frames per second. Fractional shortening and heart rate were measured as described previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup>. For cardiac contractile functions in adulthood, zebrafish were fixed on a sponge soaked with system water with the belly facing up and echocardiography was performed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref></sup>. Videos and images in color Doppler mode and B-mode were obtained using the Vevo1100 imaging system at a frequency of 50 MHz. Nikon NIS elements AR analysis and Image J software were employed for data extraction.

<title>Luciferase assay</title>
<p>The LCR (luciferase reporter) plasmid was generated by subcloning the 5′ UTR of <italic>nrg1</italic> into the upstream region of renilla luciferase on the psiCheck2 plasmid. Following construction, 25 pg of the LCR plasmid was co-injected with either 100 pg of <italic>tcf3b</italic> mRNA or 1 ng of <italic>tcf3b</italic> MO into 1-cell stage zebrafish embryos. At 48 hpf, twenty embryos were gathered into one group and fully lysed.</p>
<p>Subsequently, firefly and renilla luciferase activities were sequentially measured using a microplate reader with the dual luciferase reporter gene assay kit (Yeasen, 11402ES60), according to the manufacturer′s instructions. The experiment was independently replicated three times. The relative renilla luciferase activity, normalized by firefly luciferase activity, served as an indicator of <italic>nrg1</italic> expression level under the influence of <italic>tcf3b</italic> overexpression or reduction.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>How mechanical forces transmitted by blood flow contribute to cardiac development remains incompletely understood. Using the unique advantages of the zebrafish model, Chen et al make the fundamental discovery that endocardial expression of the transcriptional repressor, Id2b, is maintained in endocardial cells by blood flow. Id1b zebrafish mutants fail to form the valve in the atrioventricular canal (AVC) and show reduced myocardial contractility that they suggest is due to impaired calcium transients. Id2b mutants are largely viable during the first 6 months of life until ~20% display cardiomyopathy characterized by visible edema, structural abnormalities, retrograde blood flow, and reduced systolic function and calcium handling. Mechanistically, the authors suggest that flow-mediated expression of Id2b leads to neuregulin 1 (nrg1) upregulation by physically interacting with and sequestering the Tcf3b transcriptional repressor from conserved tcf3b binding sites upstream of nrg1. Overall, this study advances our understanding of flow-mediated endocardial-myocardial crosstalk during heart development.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The strengths of the study are the significance of the biological question being addressed, use of the zebrafish model, data quality, and use of genetic tools. The text is generally well-written and easy to understand.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The main weakness that remains is the lack of rigor surrounding the molecular mechanism where the authors suggest that blood flow induces endocardial expression of Id2b, which binds to Tcf3b and sequesters it from binding the Nrg1 promoter to repress transcription. Although good faith efforts were made to bolster their model, the physical interaction between Id2b and Tcf3b is limited to overexpression of tagged proteins in HEK293 cells. Moreover, no mutagenesis was performed on the tcf3b binding sites identified in the nrg1 promoter to learn their importance in vivo.</p>

<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Public Reviews:</bold></p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Chen et al. identified the role of endocardial id2b expression in cardiac contraction and valve formation through pharmaceutical, genetic, electrophysiology, calcium imaging, and echocardiography analyses. CRISPR/Cas9 generated id2b mutants demonstrated defective AV valve formation, excitation-contraction coupling, reduced endocardial cell proliferation in AV valve, retrograde blood flow, and lethal effects.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Their methods, data and analyses broadly support their claims.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The molecular mechanism is somewhat preliminary.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Biomechanical forces, such as blood flow, are crucial for organ formation, including heart development. This study by Shuo Chen et al. aims to understand how cardiac cells respond to these forces. They used zebrafish as a model organism due to its unique strengths, such as the ability to survive without heartbeats, and conducted transcriptomic analysis on hearts with impaired contractility. They thereby identified id2b as a gene regulated by blood flow and is crucial for proper heart development, in particular, for the regulation of myocardial contractility and valve formation. Using both in situ hybridization and transgenic fish they showed that id2b is specifically expressed in the endocardium, and its expression is affected by both pharmacological and genetic perturbations of contraction. They further generated a null mutant of id2b to show that loss of id2b results in heart malformation and early lethality in zebrafish. Atrioventricular (AV) and excitation-contraction coupling were also impaired in id2b mutants. Mechanistically, they demonstrate that Id2b interacts with the transcription factor Tcf3b to restrict its activity. When id2b is deleted, the repressor activity of Tcf3b is enhanced, leading to suppression of the expression of nrg1 (neuregulin 1), a key factor for heart development. Importantly, injecting tcf3b morpholino into id2b-/- embryos partially restores the reduced heart rate. Moreover, treatment of zebrafish embryos with the Erbb2 inhibitor AG1478 results in decreased heart rate, in line with a model in which Id2b modulates heart development via the Nrg1/Erbb2 axis. The research identifies id2b as a biomechanical signaling-sensitive gene in endocardial cells that mediates communication between the endocardium and myocardium, which is essential for heart morphogenesis and function.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The study provides novel insights into the molecular mechanisms by which biomechanical forces influence heart development and highlights the importance of id2b in this process.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The claims are in general well supported by experimental evidence, but the following aspects may benefit from further investigation:</p>
<p>(1) In Figure 1C, the heatmap demonstrates the up-regulated and down-regulated genes upon tricane-induced cardiac arrest. Aside from the down-regulation of id2b expression, it was also evident that id2a expression was up-regulated. As a predicted paralog of id2b, it would be interesting to see whether the up-regulation of id2a in response to tricane treatment was a compensatory response to the down-regulation of id2b expression.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for the comment. As suggested, we performed qRT-PCR analysis to assess <italic>id2a</italic> expression in tricaine-treated heart. Our results demonstrate a significant upregulation of <italic>id2a</italic> following the inhibition of cardiac contraction, suggesting a potential compensatory response to the decreased <italic>id2b</italic>. These new results have been incorporated into the revised manuscript (Figure 1D).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) The study mentioned that id2b is tightly regulated by the flow-sensitive primary cilia-klf2 signaling axis; however aside from showing the reduced expression of id2b in klf2a and klf2b mutants, there was no further evidence to solidify the functional link between id2b and klf2. It would therefore be ideal, in the present study, to demonstrate how Klf2, which is a transcriptional regulator, transduces biomechanical stimuli to Id2b.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have examined the expression levels of <italic>id2b</italic> in both <italic>klf2a</italic> and <italic>klf2b</italic> mutants. The whole mount in situ results clearly demonstrate a decrease in <italic>id2b</italic> signal in both mutants (Figure 3E). As noted by the reviewer, <italic>klf2</italic> is a transcriptional regulator, suggesting that the regulation of <italic>id2b</italic> may occur at the transcriptional level. However, dissecting the molecular mechanisms underlying the crosstalk between <italic>klf2</italic> and <italic>id2b</italic> is beyond the scope of the present study.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) The authors showed the physical interaction between ectopically expressed FLAG-Id2b and HA-Tcf3b in HEK293T cells. Although the constructs being expressed are of zebrafish origin, it would be nice to show in vivo that the two proteins interact.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for this insightful comment. As suggested, we synthesized Flag-<italic>id2b</italic> and HA-<italic>tcf3b</italic> mRNA and co-injected them into 1-cell stage zebrafish embryos. We collected 100-300 embryos at 12, 24, and 48 hpf and performed western blot analysis using the same anti-HA and anti-Flag antibodies validated in HEK293 cell experiments. Despite multiple independent attempts, we were unable to detect clear bands of the tagged proteins in zebrafish embryos. We speculate that this could be due to mRNA instability, translational efficiency, or the low abundance of Id2b and Tcf3b proteins. We have acknowledged these technical limitations in the revised manuscript and clarified that the HEK293 cell data support a potential interaction between Id2b and Tcf3b, while confirming their endogenous interaction will require further investigations (Lines 295-296).</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>How mechanical forces transmitted by blood flow contribute to normal cardiac development remains incompletely understood. Using the unique advantages of the zebrafish model system, Chen et al make the fundamental discovery that endocardial expression of id2b is induced by blood flow and required for normal atrioventricular canal (AVC) valve development and myocardial contractility by regulating calcium dynamics. Mechanistically, the authors suggest that Id2b binds to Tcf3b in endocardial cells, which relieves Tcf3b-mediated transcriptional repression of Neuregulin 1 (NRG1). Nrg1 then induces expression of the L-type calcium channel component LRRC1. This study significantly advances our understanding of flow-mediated valve formation and myocardial function.</p>

<p>Strengths of the study are the significance of the question being addressed, use of the zebrafish model, and data quality (mostly very nice imaging). The text is also well-written and easy to understand.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Weaknesses include a lack of rigor for key experimental approaches, which led to skepticism surrounding the main findings. Specific issues were the use of morpholinos instead of genetic mutants for the bmp ligands, cilia gene ift88, and tcf3b, lack of an explicit model surrounding BMP versus blood flow induced endocardial id2b expression, use of bar graphs without dots, the artificial nature of assessing the physical interaction of Tcf3b and Id2b in transfected HEK293 cells, and artificial nature of examining the function of the tcf3b binding sites upstream of nrg1.</p>

<p>We thank the reviewer for the positive assessment and the constructive suggestions. We have performed additional experiments and data analysis to address these issues. A detailed point-by-point response has been incorporated in the response to “Recommendations for the authors” section.</p>

<p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p>
<p>Questions/Concerns:</p>
<p>(1) In the introduction, it would be beneficial to include background information on the id2b gene, what is currently known about its function in heart development/regeneration and in other animal models than just the zebrafish.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for the constructive suggestion. In the revised manuscript, we have added a paragraph in the Introduction to provide background on <italic>id2b</italic> and its role in heart development. Specifically, we discuss its function as a member of the ID (inhibitor of DNA binding) family of helix-loop-helix (HLH) transcriptional regulators and highlight its involvement in cardiogenesis in both zebrafish and mouse models. These additions help place our findings in a broader developmental and evolutionary context (Lines 91-100).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) Of the 6 differentially expressed genes identified in Figure 1C, why did the authors choose to focus on id2b and not the other 5 downregulated genes?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for the comments. As suggested, we have added a sentence in the revised manuscript to clarify the rationale for selecting <italic>id2b</italic> as the focus of the present study (Lines 117-121).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) As the authors showed representative in situ images for id2b expression with blebbistatin treatment in Figure 1E, and tnn2a MO in Figure 1F, it would also be beneficial to show relative mRNA expression levels for id2b in conditions of blebbistatin treatment and tnn2a MO knockdown. In Fig. 1C: id2b is downregulated with tricaine, but id2a is upregulated with tricaine. Do these genes perform similar or different functions, results of gene duplication events?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for the thoughtful suggestion. Our in situ hybridization results demonstrate reduced <italic>id2b</italic> expression following tricaine, blebbistatin, and <italic>tnn2</italic> morpholino treatment. To further validate these observations and enhance cellular resolution, we generated an <italic>id2b:eGFP</italic> knockin line. Analysis of this reporter line confirmed a significant reduction in <italic>id2b</italic> expression in the endocardium upon inhibition of cardiac contraction and blood flow (Figure 3A-D), supporting our in situ results. The divergent expression patterns of <italic>id2a</italic> and <italic>id2b</italic> in response to tricaine treatment likely reflect functional specification following gene duplication in zebrafish. While our current study focuses on characterizing the role of <italic>id2b</italic> in zebrafish heart development, the specific function of <italic>id2a</italic> remains to be determined.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) In Fig. 2b, could the authors compare the id2b fluorescence with RNAscope ISH at 24, 48, and 72 hpf? RNAscope ISH allows for the visualization of single RNA molecules in individual cells. The authors should at least compare these in the heart to demonstrate that id2b accurately reflects the endogenous id2b expression. In Fig. 2E: Suggest showing the individual fluorescent images for id2b:eGFP and kdrl:mCherry in the same colors as top panel images instead of in black and white. In Fig. 2F: The GFP fluorescence from id2b:eGFP signals looks overexposed.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for the valuable comment. In response, we attempted RNAscope in situ hybridization on embryos carrying the <italic>id2b:eGFP</italic> reporter to directly compare fluorescent reporter expression with endogenous <italic>id2b</italic> transcripts. However, we encountered a significant reduction in <italic>id2b:eGFP</italic> fluorescence following the RNAscope procedure, and even subsequent immunostaining with anti-GFP antibodies yielded only weak signals. Despite this technical limitation, the RNAscope results independently confirmed <italic>id2b</italic> expression in endocardial cells (Figure 2E), supporting the specificity and cell-type localization observed with the reporter line. As suggested by the reviewer, we have updated Figure 2G to display <italic>id2b:eGFP</italic> and <italic>kdrl:mCherry</italic> images in the same color scheme as the top panel to improve consistency and clarity. Additionally, we have replaced the images in Figure 2F to avoid overexposure and better represent the spatial distribution of <italic>id2b:eGFP</italic> in adult heart.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) In Fig. 3A: are all the images in panel A taken with the same magnification? In Fig. 3e, could the authors show the localization of klf2 and id2b and confirm their expression in the same endocardial cells? In Fig. 3, the authors conclude that klf2-mediated biomechanical signaling is essential for activating id2b expression. This statement is somewhat overstated because they only demonstrated that knockout of klf2 reduced id2b expression.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for these constructive comments. All images presented in Figure 3A were captured using the same magnification, as now clarified in the revised figure legend. We appreciate the reviewer’s question regarding the localization of <italic>klf2</italic> and <italic>id2b</italic>. While we were unable to directly visualize both markers in the same embryos due to the current unavailability of <italic>klf2</italic> reporter lines, prior studies using <italic>klf2a:H2B-eGFP</italic> transgenic zebrafish have demonstrated that <italic>klf2a</italic> is broadly expressed in endocardial cells, with enhanced expression in the atrioventricular canal region (Heckel et al., Curr Bio 2015, PMID: 25959969; Gálvez-Santisteban et al., Elife 2019, PMID: 31237233). Our <italic>id2b:eGFP</italic> reporter analysis revealed a similarly broad endocardial expression pattern. These independent observations support the likelihood that <italic>klf2a</italic> and <italic>id2b</italic> are co-expressed in the same endocardial cell population.</p>
<p>We also appreciate the reviewer’s comments regarding the connection between biomechanical signaling and <italic>id2b</italic> expression. Previous studies have already established that biomechanical cues directly regulate <italic>klf2</italic> expression in zebrafish endocardial cells (Vermot et al., Plos Biol 2009, PMID: 19924233; Heckel et al., Curr Bio 2015, PMID: 25959969). In the present study, we observed a significant reduction in <italic>id2b</italic> expression in both <italic>klf2a</italic> and <italic>klf2b</italic> mutants, suggesting that <italic>id2b</italic> acts downstream of <italic>klf2</italic>. These observations together establish the role of biomechanical cues-<italic>klf2</italic>-<italic>id2b</italic> signaling axis in endocardial cells. Nevertheless, we agree with the reviewer that further investigation is required to elucidate the precise mechanism by which <italic>klf2</italic> regulates <italic>id2b</italic> expression.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(6) In Fig. 4: What's the mRNA expression for id2b in WT and id2b mutant fish hearts?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We performed qRT-PCR analysis on purified zebrafish hearts and observed a significant reduction in <italic>id2b</italic> mRNA levels in <italic>id2b</italic> mutants compared to wild-type controls. These new results have been incorporated into the revised manuscript (Figure 4A).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(7) In Fig. 5E, the heart rate shows no difference between id2b+/+ and id2b-/- fish according to echocardiography analysis. However, Fig. 5B indicates a difference in heart rate. Could the authors explain this discrepancy?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for this insightful observation. In our study, we observed a reduction in heart rate in <italic>id2b</italic> mutants during embryonic stages (120 hpf), as shown in Figure 5B. However, this difference was not evident in adult fish based on echocardiography analysis (Figure 5E). While the exact reason for these changes during development remains unclear, it is possible that the reduction in cardiac output observed in <italic>id2b</italic> mutants during early development triggers compensatory mechanisms over time, ultimately restoring heart rate in adulthood. Given that heart rate is primarily regulated by pacemaker activity, further investigation will be required to determine whether such compensatory adaptations occur and to elucidate the underlying mechanisms.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(8) In Fig. 6A: it's a little hard to read the gene names in the left most image in the panel. In Fig. 6B, the authors conducted qRT-PCR analysis of 72 hpf embryonic hearts and validated decreased nrg1 levels in id2b-/- compared to control. Since nrg1 is not specifically expressed in endocardial cells in the developing heart, the authors should isolate endocardial cells and compare nrg1 expression in id2b-/- to control. This would ensure that the loss of id2b affects nrg1 expression derived from endocardial cells rather than other cell types. In Supp Figure S6: Suggest adding an image of the UMAP projection to show tcf3b expression in endocardial cells from sequencing analysis.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for these helpful suggestions. In response, we have increased the font size of gene names in the leftmost panel of Figure 6A to improve readability. Regarding <italic>nrg1</italic> expression, we acknowledge the importance of assessing its cell-type specificity. Unfortunately, due to the lack of reliable transgenic or knock-in tools for <italic>nrg1</italic>, its precise expression pattern in embryonic hearts remains unclear. We attempted to isolate endocardial cells from embryonic hearts using FACS, but the limited number of cells obtained at this stage precluded reliable qRT-PCR analysis. Nonetheless, our data show that <italic>id2b</italic> is specifically expressed in endocardial cells, and publicly available single-cell RNA-seq datasets also support that <italic>nrg1</italic> is predominantly expressed in endocardial, but not myocardial or epicardial cells during embryonic heart development (Figure 6-figure supplement 1). These findings suggest that <italic>id2b</italic> may regulate <italic>nrg1</italic> expression in a cell-autonomous manner within the endocardium. As suggested, we have also added a UMAP image to Figure 7-figure supplement 1 to show <italic>tcf3b</italic> expression in endocardial cells, further supporting the cell identity in single-cell dataset.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(9) In Fig. 6, Nrg1 knockout shows no gross morphological defects and normal trabeculation in larvae. Could the authors explain why they propose that endocardial id2b promotes nrg1 synthesis, thereby enhancing cardiomyocyte contractile function? Did Nrg1 knockdown with Mo lead to compromised calcium signaling and cardiac contractile function? Nrg2a has been reported to be expressed in endocardial cells in larvae, and its loss leads to heart function defects. Perhaps Nrg2a plays a more important role than Nrg1.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for raising this important point. Although we did not directly test <italic>nrg1</italic> knockout in our study, previous reports have shown that genetic deletion of <italic>nrg1</italic> in zebrafish does not impair cardiac trabeculation during embryonic stages (Rasouli et al., Nat Commun 2017, PMID: 28485381; Brown et al., J Cell Mol Med 2018, PMID: 29265764). However, reduced trabecular area and signs of arrhythmia were observed in juvenile and adult fish (Brown et al., J Cell Mol Med 2018, PMID: 29265764), suggesting a potential role for <italic>nrg1</italic> in maintaining cardiac structure and function later in development. Whether calcium signaling and cardiac contractility are affected at these stages remains to be determined. Given that morpholino-induced knockdown is limited to early embryonic stages, it is not suitable for assessing <italic>nrg1</italic> function in juvenile or adult hearts.</p>
<p>As noted by the reviewer, <italic>nrg2a</italic> is expressed in endocardial cells, and its deletion has been associated with cardiac defects (Rasouli et al., Nat Commun 2017, PMID: 28485381). To assess its potential involvement in our model, we performed qRT-PCR analysis and observed increased <italic>nrg2a</italic> expression in <italic>id2b</italic> mutant hearts (Author response image 1). This upregulation may reflect a compensatory response to the loss of <italic>id2b</italic>. Therefore, <italic>nrg2a</italic> is unlikely to play an essential role in mediating the depressed cardiac function in this context.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for the constructive suggestion. In cardiomyocytes, <italic>tnnt2a</italic> encodes a sarcomeric protein essential for cardiac contraction, and its knockdown is a well-established method for abolishing heartbeat and blood flow in zebrafish embryos, thereby allowing investigation of flow-dependent gene regulation. In the revised manuscript, we have added a sentence and corresponding reference to clarify the rationale for using <italic>tnnt2a</italic> morpholino in our study (Lines 128-129, Reference #35).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>In Pg. 6, line 140: Results title of &quot;Cardiac contraction promotes endocardial id2b expression through primary cilia but not BMP&quot; is misleading and contradicts the results presented in this section and corresponding figure. For example, the bmp Mo knockdown experiments led to decreased id2b fluorescence and the last statement of this results section contradicts the title that BMP does not promote endocardial id2b in lines 179-180: &quot;Collectively, these results suggest that BMP signaling and blood flow modulate id2b expression in a developmental-stage-dependent manner.&quot; It would be helpful to clarify whether BMP signaling is involved in id2b expression or not.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We apologize for any confusion caused by the section title. Our results demonstrate that <italic>id2b</italic> expression is regulated by both BMP signaling and biomechanical forces in a developmental-stage-specific manner. Specifically, morpholino-mediated knockdown of <italic>bmp2b</italic>, <italic>bmp4</italic>, and <italic>bmp7a</italic> at the 1-cell stage significantly reduced <italic>id2b:eGFP</italic> fluorescence at 24 hpf (Figure 3-figure supplement 1A, B), suggesting that <italic>id2b</italic> is responsive to BMP signaling during early embryonic development. However, treatment with the BMP inhibitor Dorsomorphin during later stages (24-48 or 36-60 hpf) did not significantly alter <italic>id2b:eGFP</italic> fluorescence intensity in individual endocardial cells, although a modest reduction in total endocardial cell number was noted (Figure 3-figure supplement 1C, D). These results suggest that BMP signaling is required for <italic>id2b</italic> expression during early development but becomes dispensable at later stages, when biomechanical cues may play a more prominent role. To address this concern and better reflect the data, we have revised the Results section title to: &quot;BMP signaling and cardiac contraction regulate <italic>id2b</italic> expression&quot;. This revised title more accurately reflects the dual regulation of <italic>id2b</italic> expression (Line 153).</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p>
<p>(1) The conclusion that BMP signaling prior to 24 hpf is necessary for id2b expression is not fully supported by the data. How do the authors envision pre-linear heart tube BMP signaling impacting endocardial id2b expression during later chamber stages? Id2b reporter fluorescence can be clearly visualized in the linear heart tube in panel B from Figure 1. Does id2b expression initiate prior to contraction? Can the model be refined by showing when id2b endocardial reporter fluorescence is first observed, and whether this early/pre-contractile expression is dependent on BMP signaling?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for the important comment. As suggested, we performed morpholino-mediated knockdown of <italic>bmp2b</italic>, <italic>bmp4</italic>, and <italic>bmp7a</italic> at the 1-cell stage. Live imaging at 24 hpf showed significantly reduced <italic>id2b:eGFP</italic> fluorescence compared to controls (Figure 3-figure supplement 1A, B), suggesting that <italic>id2b</italic> is responsive to BMP signaling during early embryonic development. However, treatment with the BMP inhibitor Dorsomorphin during 24-48 or 36-60 hpf did not significantly impact <italic>id2b:eGFP</italic> fluorescence intensity in individual endocardial cells, although a reduction in endocardial cell number was observed (Figure 3-figure supplement 1C, D). These results suggest that BMP signaling is essential for <italic>id2b</italic> expression during early embryonic development, while it becomes dispensable at later stages, when biomechanical cues exert a more significant role.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) Overexpressing tagged versions of TCF3b and Id2b in HEK293 cells is a very artificial way to make the major claim that these two proteins interact in endogenous endocardial cells. Can this be done in zebrafish embryonic or adult hearts?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for this insightful comment. As suggested, we synthesized Flag-<italic>id2b</italic> and HA-<italic>tcf3b</italic> mRNA and co-injected them into 1-cell stage zebrafish embryos. We collected 100-300 embryos at 12, 24, and 48 hpf and performed western blot analysis using the same anti-HA and anti-Flag antibodies validated in HEK293 cell experiments. Despite multiple independent attempts, we were unable to detect clear bands of the tagged proteins in zebrafish embryos. We speculate that this could be due to mRNA instability, translational efficiency, or the low abundance of Id2b and Tcf3b proteins. We have acknowledged these technical limitations in the revised manuscript and clarified that the HEK293 cell data support a potential interaction between Id2b and Tcf3b, while confirming their endogenous interaction will require further investigations (Lines 295-296).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) The data presented are consistent with the claim that the tcf3b binding sites are functional upstream of nrg1 to repress its transcription. To fully support this idea, those two sites should be disrupted with gRNAs if possible.</p>

<p>We thank the reviewer for the valuable suggestion. In response, we attempted to disrupt the <italic>tcf3b</italic> binding sites using sgRNAs. However, we encountered technical difficulties in identifying sgRNAs that specifically and efficiently target these binding sites without affecting adjacent regions. Despite these challenges, our luciferase reporter assay, using <italic>tcf3b</italic> mRNA overexpression and morpholino knockdown, clearly demonstrated that <italic>tcf3b</italic> binds to and regulates <italic>nrg1</italic> promoter region.

<p>We thank the reviewer for raising this important point. In our bulk RNAseq dataset comparing <italic>id2b</italic> mutant and control hearts, GO term enrichment was primarily associated with pathways related to cardiac muscle contraction and heart contraction (Figure 5-figure supplement 1B).

<p>Line 193: The prominent enlargement of the atrium with a smaller ventricle has characterized as cardiomyopathy in zebrafish (Weeks et al. Cardiovasc Res, 2024, PMID: 38900908), which has also been associated with disruptions in calcium transients (Kamel et al J Cardiovasc Dev Dis, 2021, PMID: 33924051 and Kamel et al, Nat Commun 2021, PMID: 34887420). This information should be included in the text along with these references.</p>

<p>We thank the reviewer for this helpful suggestion. We have incorporated these important references into the revised manuscript and included the relevant information to acknowledge the established link between atrial enlargement, cardiomyopathy, and disrupted calcium transients in zebrafish models (Reference #41, 42, and 45; Lines 210 and 260).</p>
