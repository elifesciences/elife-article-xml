<title>Abstract</title><p>Mitotic anaphase onset is a key cellular process tightly regulated by multiple kinases. The involvement of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) in this process has been established in <italic>Xenopus</italic> egg extracts. However, the detailed regulatory cascade remains elusive, and also it is unknown whether the MAPKs-dependent mitotic regulation is evolutionarily conserved in the single cell eukaryotic organism such as fission yeast (<italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic>). Here we show that two MAPKs in <italic>S. pombe</italic> indeed act in concert to restrain anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) activity upon activation of the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC). One MAPK, Pmk1, binds and phosphorylates Slp1<sup>Cdc20</sup>, the co-activator of APC/C. Phosphorylation of Slp1<sup>Cdc20</sup> by Pmk1, but not by Cdk1, promotes its subsequent ubiquitylation and degradation. Intriguingly, Pmk1-mediated phosphorylation event is also required to sustain SAC under environmental stress. Thus, our study establishes a new underlying molecular mechanism of negative regulation of APC/C by MAPK upon stress stimuli, and provides an unappreciated framework for regulation of anaphase entry in eukaryotic cells.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The evolutionarily conserved mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways regulate multiple cellular functions in eukaryotic organisms in response to a wide variety of environmental cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Plotnikov et al., 2011</xref>). However, different MAPK pathways have been evolved in an organism to integrate diverse signals and fulfill different regulations on various effectors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Cansado et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Ronkina and Gaestel, 2022</xref>). This makes specifying the MAPKs and substrates involved in a specific physiological process rather complex and challenging.</p>
<p>The fission yeast <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> has three MAPK-signaling cascades: the pheromone signaling pathway (PSP), the stress-activated pathway (SAP) and the cell integrity pathway (CIP), with Spk1, Sty1 or Pmk1 as MAPK respectively (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Cansado et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Perez and Cansado, 2010</xref>). So far, the only known cell-cycle control stages linked to MAPKs in fission yeast are at G<sub>2</sub>/M transition and during cytokinesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Gomez-Gil et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Petersen and Hagan, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Petersen and Nurse, 2007</xref>). The p38 MAPK family member Sty1 either arrests or promotes mitotic commitment in unperturbed, stressed or resumed cell cycles after stress depending on the downstream kinases it associates with. Sty1 can phosphorylate kinase Srk1 or Polo kinase Plo1 to negatively or positively regulate Cdc25 phosphatase and thus the onset of mitosis, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Lopez-Aviles et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Lopez-Aviles et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Petersen and Hagan, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Petersen and Nurse, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Smith et al., 2002</xref>). Recent studies have also demonstrated that Sty1 and Pmk1 can pose negative effect on assembly of contractile actomyosin ring (CAR) and cytokinesis in response to actin cytoskeleton damage or cell wall stress (e.g. treatment with blankophor, caspofungin and caffeine) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Edreira et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Gomez-Gil et al., 2020</xref>), though the detailed mechanisms have not been elucidated.</p>

<p>In late mitosis, the timely polyubiquitylation and subsequent degradation of securin and cyclin B by anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) play a critical role for anaphase onset and chromosome segregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Peters, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Sullivan and Morgan, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Yamano, 2019</xref>). Given the essential role of APC/C in triggering chromosome segregation, it is not surprising that APC/C is a key molecular target of the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC), which is an intricate surveillance mechanism that prolongs mitosis until all chromosomes achieve correct bipolar attachments to spindle microtubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">McAinsh and Kops, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Murray, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Musacchio, 2015</xref>). Previous studies have revealed that the active MAPK is required for spindle checkpoint activation and APC/C inhibition in <italic>Xenopus</italic> egg extracts or tadpole cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Chen, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Chung and Chen, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Minshull et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Takenaka et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Zhao and Chen, 2006</xref>). These studies suggested that phosphorylation of several components of SAC, including Cdc20, Mps1 and Bub1, by MAPK serves as regulatory signals to block APC/C activation upon SAC activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Chen, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Chung and Chen, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Zhao and Chen, 2006</xref>). However, all these studies used either the anti-MAPK antibodies or small molecule inhibitor UO126 to inhibit MAPK or MAPK-specific phosphatase MKP-1 to antagonize MAPK activity, these reagents could not distinguish the contributions of different MAPKs with high specificity. Thus, those seemingly defined mechanisms might suffer the ambiguity due to potential specificity issues.</p>
<p>In <italic>S. pombe</italic>, whether MAPKs play key roles in regulation of the APC/C and spindle checkpoint remains largely unexplored. Intriguingly, all genes encoding the major components of three MAPK-signaling cascades in fission yeast are non-essential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Kim et al., 2010</xref>), this provides the possibility for investigations on their potential functions in a genetic background with complete deletion of relevant genes. In this work, we set out to directly examine the requirement of the fission yeast MAPKs in mitotic APC/C activation and anaphase entry. Our results uncovered a previously unappreciated mechanism in which Pmk1, the MAPK of CIP, phosphorylates the APC/C activator Slp1 (the Cdc20 homologue in <italic>S. pombe</italic>) upon SAC activation. Phosphorylation of Slp1<sup>Cdc20</sup> results in its ubiquitylation and degradation and thus subsequently impedes APC/C activation and anaphase entry. This mechanism also operates in response to spindle defects under environmental stress. Therefore, our finding extends cell-cycle control stages linked to MAPKs from previously recognized G<sub>2</sub>/M transition and cytokinesis to anaphase entry and mitotic exit in fission yeast. It will also be interesting to address whether this MAPK-mediated Cdc20 regulation exists as a general mechanism for balancing spindle checkpoint activity in higher eukaryotes.</p>

<title>SAP and CIP signaling components are required for spindle checkpoint activity</title>
<p>As the first step to examine the possible requirement of the fission yeast MAPKs in mitotic progression, we tested the sensitivity of deletion mutants of three fission yeast MAPKs to microtubule-destabilizing drug thiabendazole (TBZ), which has been routinely used as an indicator of defective kinetochore or spindle checkpoint (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Akera et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Saitoh et al., 1997</xref>). We noticed that <italic>pmk1</italic>Δ and <italic>sty1</italic>Δ but not <italic>spk1</italic>Δ cells were extremely sensitive to TBZ, and constitutively activated CIP or SAP signaling by overexpressing Pek1<sup>DD</sup> (Pek1-S234D;T238D) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Sugiura et al., 1999</xref>) or Wis1<sup>DD</sup> (Wis1-S469D;T473D) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Shiozaki et al., 1998</xref>) respectively, but not activated PSP signaling by overexpressing Byr1<sup>DD</sup> (Byr1-S214D;T218D) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Ozoe et al., 2002</xref>), also caused yeast cells to be sensitive to TBZ (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>; <xref rid="fig1S1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1-figure supplement 1A</xref> and <xref rid="fig1S2" ref-type="fig">Figure 1-figure supplement 2A, B</xref>). These observations indicated that Pmk1 and Sty1 pathways might be involved in mitosis-related processes.</p>
<p>To extend our analysis and precisely quantify whether the SAC is properly activated and maintained in MAPK mutants, we adopted one well-established assay using the cold-sensitive β-tubulin mutant <italic>nda3-KM311</italic>, which compromises the kinetochore-spindle microtubule attachment upon cold treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Hiraoka et al., 1984</xref>), to analyze the ability of cells to arrest in mitosis in the absence of spindle microtubules and enter anaphase when spindle microtubules are reassembled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bai et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">May et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Vanoosthuyse and Hardwick, 2009</xref>). In this assay, the SAC was first robustly activated by the <italic>nda3-KM311</italic> mutant at 18 °C and then inactivated simply by shift mitotically arrested cells back to permissive temperature (30 °C) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1C</xref>). Because Cdc13 (cyclin B in <italic>S. pombe</italic>) localizes to the spindle pole bodies (SPBs) in early mitosis and should be degraded by APC/C to promote metaphase-anaphase transition, accumulation of Cdc13-GFP on SPBs after cold treatment serves as the read-out of the SAC activation, and the disappearance rate of Cdc13-GFP spot under permissive temperature reflects the SAC inactivation efficacy (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1C</xref>). It is noteworthy that the ATP analogue-sensitive mutant <italic>sty1-T97A</italic> (i.e. <italic>sty1-as2</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Zuin et al., 2010</xref>), instead of <italic>sty1Δ</italic> deletion mutant, was used in this assay. That was due to the G<sub>2</sub> delay that has been demonstrated in the <italic>sty1Δ</italic> deletion mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Shiozaki and Russell, 1995a</xref>), which could interfere mitotic timing for further analysis in this assay. We found that inactivation of CIP or SAP signaling by <italic>pmk1</italic>Δ or <italic>sty1-T97A</italic> compromised full SAC activation, as these two mutants had only less than 60% of cells with Cdc13-GFP on SPBs after 6 hours of cold treatment, whereas the percentage in wild-type and <italic>spk1</italic>Δ cells after the same treatment was roughly 90% (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>; <xref rid="fig1S1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1-figure supplement 1C</xref>). Consistently, the disappearance of Cdc13-GFP from SPBs in <italic>pek1<sup>DD</sup></italic>and <italic>wis1<sup>DD</sup></italic> but not <italic>byr1<sup>DD</sup></italic> mutant cells released from metaphase-arrest was severely delayed (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>; <xref rid="fig1S1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1-figure supplement 1B</xref> and <xref rid="fig1S2" ref-type="fig">Figure 1-figure supplement 2C, D</xref>), suggesting delayed SAC inactivation and anaphase onset after release from spindle checkpoint arrest when CIP or SAP signaling is constitutively activated.</p>
<p>To corroborate our above observations of negative effect of CIP or SAP signaling on SAC strength, we took advantage of a different spindle checkpoint activation and metaphase-arresting mechanism involving Mad2 overexpression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">May et al., 2017</xref>). After <italic>P<sub>nmt1</sub>-mad2<sup>+</sup></italic> was induced to overexpress for 18 hours, we counted cells with short spindles visualized by GFP-Atb2 as indicative of metaphase-arrest and SAC-activation (<xref rid="fig1S3" ref-type="fig">Figure 1-figure supplement 3A</xref>). We found that the ability of Mad2-overexpressing cells to arrest in mitosis was clearly compromised in <italic>pmk1</italic>Δ and <italic>sty1-T97A</italic> mutants, but not in <italic>spk1</italic>Δ mutant (<xref rid="fig1S3" ref-type="fig">Figure 1-figure supplement 3B</xref>).</p>
<p>All above data suggested that MAPK pathways are evolutionarily conserved in the fission yeast to participate in spindle checkpoint activation and maintenance, of which the CIP and SAP signaling pathways, but not the Spk1 pathway, are actively involved.</p>

<title>CIP and SAP signaling attenuate protein levels of Slp1<sup>Cdc20</sup> and facilitate association of MCC with APC/C respectively</title>
<p>The mitotic checkpoint complex (MCC, consisting of Mad3-Mad2-Slp1<sup>Cdc20</sup> in <italic>S. pombe</italic>) is the most potent inhibitor of the APC/C prior to anaphase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Kapanidou et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Primorac and Musacchio, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Sudakin et al., 2001</xref>). Previous study has revealed that <italic>Xenopus</italic> MAPK phosphorylates Cdc20 and facilitates its binding by Mad2, BubR1 (Mad3 in <italic>S. pombe</italic>) and Bub3 to form a tight MCC to prevent Cdc20 from activating the APC/C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Chung and Chen, 2003</xref>). In fission yeast, the key SAC components Mad2 and Mad3 and one molecule of Slp1<sup>Cdc20</sup> form MCC which binds to APC/C through another molecule of Slp1<sup>Cdc20</sup> upon checkpoint arrest, and the recovery from mitotic arrest accompanies the loss of MCC-APC/C binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">May et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Sczaniecka et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Sewart and Hauf, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Vanoosthuyse and Hardwick, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Since we found that constitutive activation of CIP or SAP signaling in fission yeast by <italic>pek1<sup>DD</sup></italic> or <italic>wis1<sup>DD</sup></italic> mutations caused prolonged SAC activation, we were suspicious that these two MAPK pathways might also execute their functions cooperatively through a similar mechanism to that in <italic>Xenopus</italic>. To test this possibility, we analyzed the MCC occupancy on APC/C by immunoprecipitations of the APC/C subunit Lid1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Yoon et al., 2002</xref>) in <italic>pek1<sup>DD</sup></italic>and <italic>wis1<sup>DD</sup></italic> cells arrested by activated checkpoint. Compared to wild-type, more MCC components (Mad2 plus Mad3 and Slp1<sup>Cdc20</sup>) were co-immunoprecipitated in <italic>wis1<sup>DD</sup></italic> cells, while less of them were co-immunoprecipitated in <italic>pek1<sup>DD</sup></italic> cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>), suggesting that activation of the SAP but not the CIP pathway enhanced the association of MCC with APC/C.</p>

<p>In the course of the above immunoprecipitations, we noticed the decrease of co-immunoprecipitated Mad2 and Mad3 in <italic>pek1<sup>DD</sup></italic> cells, which was largely out of expectation. Further analysis of the inputs of these immunoprecipitations showed that Slp1<sup>Cdc20</sup> levels were significantly reduced in <italic>pek1<sup>DD</sup></italic> but not <italic>wis1<sup>DD</sup></italic> cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). Our immunoblotting analyses using the total lysate of <italic>pek1<sup>DD</sup></italic> or <italic>wis1<sup>DD</sup></italic> cells arrested at metaphase also confirmed these results (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). Consistently, the Slp1<sup>Cdc20</sup> level was significantly increased in <italic>pmk1Δ</italic> and <italic>pmk1Δ sty1-T79A</italic> cells but not in <italic>sty1-T79A</italic> cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>). The elevated Slp1<sup>Cdc20</sup> level in <italic>pmk1Δ</italic> cells is similar to that we observed in cells harboring two copies of <italic>slp1<sup>+</sup></italic>, which leads to artificially increased Slp1<sup>Cdc20</sup> level and also causes a SAC strength defect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bai et al., 2022</xref>). It is noteworthy that attenuated levels of Slp1<sup>Cdc20</sup> in <italic>pek1<sup>DD</sup></italic> cells was not due to decreased transcription of <italic>slp1<sup>+</sup></italic> gene (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>). These results collectively revealed a negative effect of CIP but not SAP signaling on Slp1<sup>Cdc20</sup> levels upon SAC activation, which potentially results in the weakened MCC-APC/C interaction detected in CIP mutants (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>).</p>
<p>Next, we also tested whether activation of the CIP signaling causes downregulation of Slp1<sup>Cdc20</sup> in normally growing mitotic cells, which were enriched by release of <italic>cdc25-22</italic> background cells from G<sub>2</sub>/M-arrest to 25 °C for 60-90 minutes (<xref rid="fig2S1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2-figure supplement 1A, B</xref>). Intriguingly, we could detect only marginally reduced Slp1<sup>Cdc20</sup> levels in <italic>pek1<sup>DD</sup></italic> cells, which was consistent with the slightly retarded anaphase entry in those cells, but we failed to observe any elevated Slp1<sup>Cdc20</sup> levels in <italic>pmk1Δ</italic> cells (<xref rid="fig2S1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2-figure supplement 1C</xref>). These results suggested that CIP signaling only plays a negligible role in influencing Slp1<sup>Cdc20</sup> levels when SAC is not activated.</p>
<p>Together, our above data suggested a new mechanism involves division of labor between the two fission yeast MAPK pathways CIP (Pek1-Pmk1) and SAP (Wis1-Sty1) upon SAC activation, which is required in concert to lower Slp1<sup>Cdc20</sup> levels and enhance MCC affinity for APC/C to strongly inhibit APC/C activity (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>). In this study, we only focused on characterizing the role of the CIP/Pmk1 in regulating SAC inactivation and anaphase onset hereafter.</p>

<p>In previous reports, MAPK-docking sites, which are important for interaction with MAPKs, have been identified at the N termini of different MAPKKs from yeast to humans with a notable feature of a cluster of at least two basic residues (mainly Lys/K and Arg/R) separated by a spacer of 2-6 residues from a hydrophobic-X-hydrophobic sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Bardwell et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bardwell and Thorner, 1996</xref>). Thus, we attempted to identify the potential key residues in Slp1<sup>Cdc20</sup> that mediate the Pmk1-Slp1<sup>Cdc20</sup> interaction. By visual scanning of Slp1<sup>Cdc20</sup> sequence, we noticed five basic-residue patches which are also present in several fungal species and loosely resemble the consensus sequence of the known MAPK-docking sites, and four of them are within N-terminal portion of the protein (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref> and <xref rid="fig3S1" ref-type="fig">Figure 3-figure supplement 1</xref>). However, only mutating either of the two most N-terminal basic-residue patches (19-KKR-21 and 47-KR-48) to glutamates (Glu, E) or alanines (Ala, A) in Slp1<sup>Cdc20</sup> resulted in decreased amount of Slp1<sup>Cdc20</sup> pulled down by Pmk1-GST <italic>in vitro</italic> using the bacterially expressed recombinant proteins, and mutating both patches or mutating only two arginine residues (R21 and R48) in those patches was sufficient to completely disrupt their interaction (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref> and <xref rid="fig3S2" ref-type="fig">Figure 3-figure supplement 2</xref>). Importantly, mutations of these Pmk1-docking sequences in Slp1 (PDSS for short) to alanines mimicked <italic>pmk1Δ</italic> mutant in both elevated Slp1<sup>Cdc20</sup> protein levels (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>) and defective activation and maintenance of the SAC upon <italic>nda3</italic>-mediated checkpoint arrest (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref> and <xref rid="fig3S3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3-figure supplement 3</xref>). Also, similar to removal of Pek1 downstream MAPK Pmk1, the lowered Slp1<sup>Cdc20</sup> protein levels and delayed SAC inactivation in <italic>pek1<sup>DD</sup></italic> mutant could be relieved by <italic>slp1(DS-5A)</italic> mutant, which is deficient in Pmk1-docking (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3E</xref> and <xref rid="fig3S3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3-figure supplement 3</xref>).</p>
<p>Previously, one conserved non-canonical Pmk1-docking sequence which bears positively charged residues and IYT motif has been identified in MAPK phosphatase Pmp1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Sacristan-Reviriego et al., 2014</xref>). Very strikingly, insertion of a 15 amino acid sequence containing the Pmk1-docking sequence in Pmp1 (or PDSP for short) right in front of the first basic-residue patch in Slp1(DS-5A) mutant protein restored its interaction with Pmk1 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3C</xref>). And this artificially forced Pmk1-Slp1<sup>Cdc20</sup>interaction via PDSP was able to lower Slp1<sup>Cdc20</sup> protein levels and restore higher percentage of metaphase arrest upon SAC activation in <italic>slp1(DS-5A)</italic> mutant, which is Pmk1-docking-deficient, although the rescuing effect was less efficient than the presence of genuine PDSS (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3E</xref> and <xref rid="fig3S3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3-figure supplement 3</xref>). These data firmly supported the idea that Pmk1 binds Slp1<sup>Cdc20</sup> to downregulate its levels upon SAC activation.</p>
<p>Collectively, these results demonstrated that Pmk1 directly binds to Slp1<sup>Cdc20</sup> through two short N-terminal basic patches serving as the major docking sites for Pmk1, and the physical interaction of Pmk1-Slp1<sup>Cdc20</sup> is involved in attenuation of Slp1<sup>Cdc20</sup> abundance upon SAC activation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref>).</p>

<p>To identify potential phosphorylation sites <italic>in vivo</italic>, we purified Apc15-GFP from wild type, <italic>pmk1Δ</italic> and <italic>pek1<sup>DD</sup></italic> cells arrested by activated checkpoint with intention that the Slp1<sup>Cdc20</sup>-containing APC/C complexes could be captured (<xref rid="fig4S1" ref-type="fig">Figure 4-figure supplement 1A</xref> and <xref rid="fig4S1" ref-type="fig">1B</xref>). Purifications were performed in the presence of phosphatase inhibitors to enrich for phosphopeptides. Mass spectrometry analysis revealed that the phosphorylation of Thr480 residue at the most C-terminus of Slp1<sup>Cdc20</sup> was dependent on the presence of Pmk1, and this modification was present in <italic>pek1<sup>DD</sup></italic> but not in wild type cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>, <xref rid="fig4S1" ref-type="fig">Figure 4-figure supplement 1C-E</xref> and <xref rid="fig4S2" ref-type="fig">Figure 4-figure supplement 2</xref>), indicating that phosphorylation of Thr480 is very likely triggered by CIP signaling. We raised phospho-specific antibodies against pT480, it could recognize Slp1<sup>Cdc20</sup> fragment phosphorylated by Pmk1 <italic>in vitro</italic> and mutation of Thr480 to alanine (T480A) abolished site-specific phosphorylation (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>). We also confirmed that endogenous Slp1<sup>Cdc20</sup> was indeed phosphorylated at Thr480 in metaphase-arrested <italic>mts3-1</italic> cells, which was enhanced in <italic>pek1<sup>DD</sup></italic> mutant and diminished in <italic>pmk1Δ</italic> mutant (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>). Furthermore, we examined how <italic>in vivo</italic> Slp1<sup>Cdc20</sup> phosphorylation at Thr480 is affected by forced targeting of Slp1<sup>Cdc20</sup> to Pmk1. By taking advantage of the high binding affinity of GFP-binding protein (GBP) to GFP and its variants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Chen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Rothbauer et al., 2006</xref>), we constructed strains ectopically expressing Slp1<sup>(1-60aa)</sup>-mEGFP-2xNLS-GST-Slp1<sup>(456-488aa)</sup> and Pmk1-GBP-mCherry, which could bring about artificial tethering of Slp1<sup>Cdc20</sup> fragments to Pmk1 inside nuclei (<xref rid="fig4S3" ref-type="fig">Figure 4-figure supplement 3A, B</xref>). Immunoblot detection of Slp1<sup>Cdc20</sup> phosphorylation at T480 <italic>in vivo</italic> demonstrated that indeed the presence of Pmk1-GBP-mCherry could increase pThr480 levels of mEGFP-fusion of Slp1<sup>Cdc20</sup> fragments, and simultaneously overexpressing Pek1<sup>DD</sup> from <italic>P<sub>adh11</sub>-6xHA-pek1<sup>DD</sup></italic> further enhanced the effect (<xref rid="fig4S3" ref-type="fig">Figure 4-figure supplement 3C</xref>). Thus, our results established Thr480 as a major Pmk1 phosphorylation site <italic>in vivo</italic> upon SAC activation.</p>
<p>In addition to pT480, our mass spectrometry analysis also identified Ser28, Thr31 and Ser59 as Pmk1-independent and Ser76 as Pmk1-dependent phosphorylation sites (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>, <xref rid="fig4S1" ref-type="fig">Figure 4-figure supplement 1C-E</xref> and <xref rid="fig4S2" ref-type="fig">Figure 4-figure supplement 2</xref>). All these four residues are located within the N-terminal unstructured region, fit with the Cdk1 core motif (SP or TP), and more importantly, they are conserved only in four <italic>Schizosaccharomyces</italic> species and several other fungal species but not in higher eukaryotes (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>, <xref rid="fig3S1" ref-type="fig">Figure 3-figure supplement 1B</xref> and <xref rid="fig4S4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4-figure supplement 4</xref>).

By using the phospho-specific antibodies against both pS28 and pT31, we could detect the phosphorylation of Ser28 and Thr31 <italic>in vitro</italic> by Cdc13 (cyclin B)-containing Cdk1 complexes purified from metaphase-arrested yeast cells, which was diminished when the kinase activity of ATP analogue-sensitive Cdk1 [Cdc2-as1(F84G)] was inhibited by 1-NM-PP1 or when Slp1<sup>(S28A;T31A)</sup> was added as the substrate in <italic>in vitro</italic> kinase reactions (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>). Next, we examined whether Ser28 and Thr31 were phosphorylated <italic>in vivo</italic> using immunoblotting with phospho-specific antibodies to directly detect Slp1<sup>Cdc20</sup>, which was co-immunoprecipitated with Apc15 from <italic>nda3</italic>-arrested yeast cells. We observed phosphorylation of Ser28/Thr31 in wild type cells, but it disappeared following phosphatase treatment of wild type samples after immunoprecipitation, 1-NM-PP1 treatment of <italic>cdc2-as1</italic> cells before being collected for immunoprecipitation, or when cells expressing Slp1<sup>(S28A;T31A)</sup> were used (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>). Thus, Slp1<sup>Cdc20</sup> is also phosphorylated by Cdk1 at least at Ser28 and Thr31 in fission yeast mitotic cells.</p>
<p>We wondered whether Slp1<sup>Cdc20</sup> phosphorylation by Pmk1 affects its stability and APC/C activation. Indeed, phospho-deficient Slp1<sup>T480A</sup> mutant showed elevated Slp1<sup>Cdc20</sup> levels in both metaphase-arrested and asynchronously grown cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4G</xref> and <xref rid="fig4S5" ref-type="fig">Figure 4-figure supplement 5</xref>) and compromised SAC activation compared to wild type cells, likely due to more efficient APC/C activation (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4H</xref> and <xref rid="fig4S6" ref-type="fig">Figure 4-figure supplement 6</xref>). Furthermore, Slp1<sup>T480A</sup> mutant also reversed the inhibitory effect of <italic>pek1<sup>DD</sup></italic> on Slp1<sup>Cdc20</sup> stability and APC/C activation after release from SAC-mediated arrest (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4G</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4H</xref>).</p>
<p>Ser76 was identified as a Pmk1-dependent phosphorylation residue in our mass spectrometry analysis, but it was considered as a Cdk1 targeting site in an earlier study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Swaffer et al., 2018</xref>). It is fairly possible that phosphorylation of Ser76 is promoted by both Cdk1 and Pmk1, which is conceivable as CDKs and MAPKs recognize the same core motif (SP/TP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Pinna and Ruzzene, 1996</xref>), and crosstalk between CDK and MAPK has recently been reported for pheromone signaling in budding yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Repetto et al., 2018</xref>). We tested how the double phosphorylation sites (S76A;T480A) mutant affects Slp1<sup>Cdc20</sup> levels or APC/C activity, and observed that the protein levels of Slp1<sup>S76A;T480A</sup> were further elevated and SAC activation efficiency in this mutant was further lowered compared to Slp1<sup>T480A</sup> mutant (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4G</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4H</xref>). Of note, Slp1<sup>T480A</sup> and Slp1<sup>S76A;T480A</sup> mutant proteins became easily detected in interphase cells (<xref rid="fig4S5" ref-type="fig">Figure 4-figure supplement 5</xref>), this is very different from wild-type Slp1 which normally accumulates exclusively in mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Yamada et al., 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>We further tested whether replacement of other identified phospho-serine/threonine residues with alanines affects Slp1<sup>Cdc20</sup> protein levels and APC/C activity. We constructed strains carrying combinations of mutations of S28A, T31A and S59A with S76A, and also with confirmed Pmk1 phosphorylation-deficient T480A, and found that mutations of S28A, T31A and S59A did not affect Slp1<sup>Cdc20</sup> protein levels, though they could also profoundly compromise SAC activation efficiency similarly to S76A;T480A mutant (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4G</xref>, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4H</xref>, <xref rid="fig4S5" ref-type="fig">Figure 4-figure supplement 5</xref>, and <xref rid="fig4S6" ref-type="fig">Figure 4-figure supplement 6</xref>). We noticed that the presence of mutations of S28A, T31A and S59A also abolished the elevated Slp1<sup>Cdc20</sup> protein levels conferred by S76A;T480A mutations (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4G</xref> and <xref rid="fig4S5" ref-type="fig">Figure 4-figure supplement 5</xref>). Thus, phosphorylation of S28, T31 and S59 targeted by Cdk1 most likely influences APC/C activation through distinct mechanism from Pmk1-mediated S76/T480 phosphorylation.</p>
<p>Taken together, our data suggested that activated Pmk1 phosphorylates Slp1<sup>Cdc20</sup> <italic>in vivo</italic>, which leads to lowered Slp1<sup>Cdc20</sup> levels, delayed SAC inactivation and APC/C activation as we observed in <italic>pek1<sup>DD</sup></italic>cells. Also, Pmk1 can join Cdk1 to enhance the multi-site phosphorylation of their shared substrate Slp1<sup>Cdc20</sup> and collaboratively dampen APC/C activity.</p>

<title>Pmk1- but not Cdk1-mediated Slp1<sup>Cdc20</sup> phosphorylation promotes its ubiquitylation</title>
<p>Our above data support the notion that the direct binding of Slp1<sup>Cdc20</sup> by Pmk1 mediates its phosphorylation, which possibly results its subsequent rapid turnover. It has been shown in both human and fission yeast cells that Apc15, one of the conserved components of APC/C, promotes Cdc20/Slp1<sup>Cdc20</sup> autoubiquitylation and its turnover by APC/C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Mansfeld et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">May et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Sewart and Hauf, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Uzunova et al., 2012</xref>). The increased Slp1<sup>Cdc20</sup> levels in <italic>pmk1Δ</italic> cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>) is reminiscent of the previous observations in <italic>apc15Δ</italic> mutant, which also shows elevated levels of Slp1<sup>Cdc20</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">May et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Sewart and Hauf, 2017</xref>). We reasoned that the absence of Apc15 may reverse the negative effect of <italic>pek1<sup>DD</sup></italic> on Slp1<sup>Cdc20</sup> levels and spindle checkpoint inactivation and APC/C activation. As expected, we indeed observed that deletion of <italic>apc15</italic> recovered Slp1<sup>Cdc20</sup> levels in <italic>pek1<sup>DD</sup></italic> cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>), and also lowered the percentage of cells with Cdc13-GFP retained on SPBs in <italic>nda3-KM311 pek1<sup>DD</sup></italic> cells after cold treatment (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref> and <xref rid="fig5S1" ref-type="fig">Figure 5-figure supplement 1</xref>).

<p>During the course of our mass spectrometry analysis on Slp1<sup>Cdc20</sup> phosphorylation, we also detected Lys 479 (K479) as an ubiquitin-modifying site (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>, <xref rid="fig4S1" ref-type="fig">Figure 4-figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref rid="fig4S2" ref-type="fig">Figure 4-figure supplement 2</xref>). We wondered whether K479 is involved in Slp1<sup>Cdc20</sup> autoubiquitylation in fission yeast. In agreement with the mass spectrometry analysis, mutation of K479 to arginine indeed conferred stability of Slp1<sup>Cdc20</sup> (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>), even in asynchronously growing cells (<xref rid="fig5S2" ref-type="fig">Figure 5-figure supplement 2</xref>), which is reminiscent of the stabilized Slp1<sup>Cdc20</sup> in <italic>apc15Δ</italic> mutant cells at interphase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Sewart and Hauf, 2017</xref>). These results suggested that K479 is likely Slp1<sup>Cdc20</sup> ubiquitylation-relevant. Furthermore, <italic>nda3-KM311 slp1<sup>K479R</sup></italic> cells also demonstrated lowered metaphase arrest rate after cold treatment (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref> and <xref rid="fig5S1" ref-type="fig">Figure 5-figure supplement 1</xref>), indicating defective SAC activation. Previous studies have identified two neighbouring lysine residues close to the carboxy terminus of human Cdc20, Lys485 and Lys490, as ubiquitylation sites in prometaphase cells, and mutating these two lysines to arginine completely prevented Cdc20 ubiquitylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Danielsen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Mansfeld et al., 2011</xref>). Very interestingly, a second lysine residue, K472, is also present in fission yeast Slp1<sup>Cdc20</sup> adjacent to K479 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref> and <xref rid="fig5S3" ref-type="fig">Figure 5-figure supplement 3</xref>). Although K472 was not identified as an ubiquitin-modifying residue in our mass spectrometry analysis, replacement of K472 with arginine also efficiently stabilized Slp1<sup>Cdc20</sup>, similar to K479R mutant (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref> and <xref rid="fig5S2" ref-type="fig">Figure 5-figure supplement 2</xref>). More strikingly, simultaneously mutating both K472 and K479 caused additive effects in elevating Slp1<sup>Cdc20</sup> levels and lowering SAC activation rate in wild-type or <italic>pek1<sup>DD</sup></italic> strain background (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5D</xref>, <xref rid="fig5S1" ref-type="fig">Figure 5-figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref rid="fig5S2" ref-type="fig">Figure 5-figure supplement 2</xref>), suggesting that likely both these two lysine residues at the C-terminal tail of Slp1<sup>Cdc20</sup> contribute to its turnover via ubiquitylation, which is very similar to the mechanism in human Cdc20. Consistently, using TUBEs (tandem ubiquitin-binding entities) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Hjerpe et al., 2009</xref>) to enrich for ubiquitinated proteins in metaphase-arrested <italic>mts3-1</italic> cells expressing sfGFP-Slp1, we were able to demonstrate that mutating both K472 and K479 largely removed higher molecular weight bands detected by immunoblotting, which were corresponding to ubiquitylated species of Slp1<sup>Cdc20</sup> (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E, F</xref>). We also noticed that Slp1<sup>K472R;</sup> <sup>K479R</sup> rendered more severely compromised viability than either single mutants (<xref rid="fig5S4" ref-type="fig">Figure 5-figure supplement 4</xref>), indicating blocking Slp1<sup>Cdc20</sup> ubiquitylation could bring about detrimental consequence to the cells.</p>
<p>Our observation that Slp1<sup>Cdc20</sup> levels were lowered in <italic>pek1<sup>DD</sup></italic>mutant (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>) suggested that attenuation of Slp1<sup>Cdc20</sup> levels upon constitutive activation of CIP signaling is very likely through facilitating its autoubiquitylation. To test this possibility, we examined and compared the ubiquitylation levels of sfGFP-Slp1 in wild type, <italic>pmk1</italic>Δ and <italic>pek1<sup>DD</sup></italic> cells by affinity pull-down assays using TUBEs (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref>). Indeed, we observed a much weaker or stronger discrete laddering pattern of sfGFP-Slp1 in <italic>pmk1</italic>Δ and <italic>pek1<sup>DD</sup></italic> cells respectively than that of wild type cells, indicating abated or enhanced ubiquitylation (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5F</xref>). Furthermore, mutations of T480A, S76A/T480A and Pmk1-docking site, but not S28A/T31A- or S28A/T31A/S59A-containing mutants, also reduced polyubiquitylation of Slp1<sup>Cdc20</sup> in both <italic>pek1<sup>+</sup></italic> cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5F</xref>) and <italic>pek1<sup>DD</sup></italic>-overexpressing (i.e. <italic>P<sub>adh11</sub></italic>-<italic>pek1<sup>DD</sup></italic>) cells (<xref rid="fig5S5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5-figure supplement 5</xref>). All these results confirmed that Pmk1- but not Cdk1-mediated Slp1<sup>Cdc20</sup> phosphorylation promotes its ubiquitylation.</p>
<p>Together, these findings lent further support to the idea that the CIP signaling pathway restrain APC/C activity through a cascade mechanism, in which Pmk1 directly binds and phosphorylates Slp1<sup>Cdc20</sup> to facilitate its autoubiquitylation, and eventually lowers its levels (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5G</xref>).</p>

<title>Osmotic stress and cell wall damage trigger rapid Slp1<sup>Cdc20</sup> downregulation and mitotic exit delay</title>
<p>It has been well established that two MAPKs Sty1 and Pmk1 can be activated by environmental perturbations including osmotic stress, cell wall damage, thermal stress, oxidative stress, and glucose limitation, among others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Cansado et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Madrid et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Shiozaki and Russell, 1995b</xref>). We wondered whether the phosphorylation of Slp1<sup>Cdc20</sup> by Pmk1 could tune the strength of SAC activation and APC/C activity in response to extracellular stress. To investigate this possibility, we performed arrest-and-release experiments with <italic>nda3-KM311</italic> mutants and added 0.6 M KCl or 2 µg/mL of caspofungin 1 hr before release from metaphase arrest to elicit strong osmotic saline stress (KCl) or cell wall damage stress (caspofungin) response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Madrid et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Madrid et al., 2016</xref>), respectively (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>). As previously reported, treatment with KCl or caspofungin resulted in full activation of both Pmk1 and Sty1 (for KCl treatment) or only Pmk1 (for caspofungin treatment) as determined using anti-phospho p42/44 or anti-phospho p38 antibodies, which serve as indicative of respective Pmk1 and Sty1 activation (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>). Intriguingly, treatment with KCl or caspofungin also correlated with a marked and rapid decrease in Slp1<sup>Cdc20</sup> levels (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>). It is of note that SAC activation <italic>per se</italic> did not trigger activation of CIP pathway, as we did not observe any elevated Pmk1 phosphorylation in metaphase-arrested cells either by <italic>nda3</italic>-<italic>KM311</italic> mutation (see “control” samples in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>) or by Mad2-overexpression (<xref rid="fig6S1" ref-type="fig">Figure 6-figure supplement 1</xref>).</p>

<p>Next, we investigated whether environmental perturbations affect APC/C-MCC interaction. Surprisingly, we did not see any alteration of APC/C-MCC interaction accompanying Pmk1 activation when cells were treated by caspofungin (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>), which was different from what we observed in <italic>P<sub>adh11</sub>-pek1<sup>DD</sup></italic> cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). Also, we failed to detect enhanced APC/C-MCC association like we observed in <italic>P<sub>adh11</sub>-wis1<sup>DD</sup></italic> cells when cells were treated by KCl, where Sty1 was activated (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>). The latter observation was most likely due to the disruptive effect of high concentration of KCl on protein-protein interactions, because we observed similar effect when we immunoprecipitated APC/C in the presence of 0.6 M KCl in the lysis buffer (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>, right panel). With this data, we could not exclude the possibility that activated Sty1 transiently enhanced APC/C-MCC association in yeast cells, which was soon counteracted by the disruptive effect of saline. Nevertheless, the high SAC activation efficiency in mitotis-arrested cells exposed to osmotic stress (KCl) or cell wall damage stress (caspofungin) was largely lowered by <italic>pmk1</italic> deletion (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D</xref> and <xref rid="fig6S2" ref-type="fig">Figure 6-figure supplement 2</xref>), indicating that at least activated Pmk1 exerts regulation of the spindle checkpoint and APC/C activation under environmental stimuli. Further, Pmk1-docking site mutant <italic>slp1(DS-5A</italic>) and Pmk1 phosphorylation-deficient mutants <italic>slp1<sup>T480A</sup></italic> and <italic>slp1<sup>S76A;T480A</sup></italic> could partially suppress the sustained SAC activation responding to osmotic and cell wall damage stresses (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6E</xref> and <xref rid="fig6S2" ref-type="fig">Figure 6-figure supplement 2</xref>). And accordingly, protein levels of Pmk1 phosphorylation-deficient mutants Slp1<sup>T480A</sup> and Slp1<sup>S76A;T480A</sup> under above stresses were restored almost to the wild-type Slp1 levels in untreated metaphase-arrested cells (<xref rid="fig6S3" ref-type="fig">Figure 6-figure supplement 3</xref>). We also noticed that protein levels of ubiquitylation-deficient mutants, including Slp1<sup>K472R</sup>, Slp1<sup>K479R</sup> and Slp1<sup>K472R;K479R</sup>, were more efficiently maintained than Slp1<sup>T480A</sup> and therefore more resistant to osmotic and cell wall damage stresses (<xref rid="fig6S3" ref-type="fig">Figure 6-figure supplement 3</xref>).</p>

<title>MAPKs are involved in regulation of mitotic anaphase onset in fission yeast</title>
<p>APC/C-mediated proteolysis of cyclin B and securin is key for anaphase entry by inactivating Cdk1 and permitting chromosome segregation, respectively. In response to unattached or tensionless kinetochores, the SAC induces MCC generation. As a critical APC/C inhibitor, MCC fulfills its function through the physical binding of BubR1/Mad3 and Mad2 to two molecules of Cdc20/Slp1<sup>Cdc20</sup> (<italic>i.e.</italic> Cdc20<sup>MCC</sup> and Cdc20<sup>APC/C</sup>), and this mechanism has been confirmed at least in both humans and fission yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Alfieri et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Chao et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Izawa and Pines, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Sewart and Hauf, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Yamaguchi et al., 2016</xref>). Thus, Cdc20 is unique amongst the MCC proteins in that it is simultaneously a coactivator and inhibitor of the APC/C.</p>
<p>In the current study, we have uncovered a dual mechanism, in which two fission yeast MAPKs Pmk1 and Sty1 restrain APC/C activity through distinct manners, either by phosphorylating Slp1<sup>Cdc20</sup> to lower its levels or by phosphorylating unknown substrate(s) to promote MCC-APC/C association and thus SAC signaling strength, respectively (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref>). Therefore, our study has established another critical APC/C-inhibitory mechanism in the spindle checkpoint, though it will be important for future studies to identify the phosphorylation target(s) posed by SAP signaling pathway. We should mention that most of our experimental setups in this study were based on cold-sensitive <italic>nda3-KM311</italic> mutant, which causes loss of both kinetochore-microtubule attachments and intra-kinetochore tension when being grown at 18 °C. However, we were unable to distinguish whether MAPK involvement in SAC dynamics is relevant to one perturbation or another or both. Nevertheless, our current study together with earlier report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Edreira et al., 2020</xref>) have implicated fission yeast Pmk1 in both the mitotic and cytokinesis surveillance mechanisms in response to unfavorable environmental stimuli.</p>

<p>The regulation of mitotic entry by MAPK in fission yeast is triggered by many environmental insults, including high osmolarity, oxidative stress, heat shock, centrifugation, nutrient starvation and rapamycin treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Hartmuth and Petersen, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Petersen and Hagan, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Petersen and Nurse, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Shiozaki and Russell, 1995a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Shiozaki et al., 1998</xref>). We found that treatment of fission yeast cells with KCl or caspofungin, which provokes a strong osmotic stress or cell wall damage response and quick Pmk1 activation, correlated with an attenuated Slp1<sup>Cdc20</sup> protein levels and delayed APC/C activation. Thus, our finding implicates MAPK Pmk1 as an important regulator for anaphase entry in response to adverse extracellular conditions. Intriguingly, one previous study showed that treatment of human cells with the carcinogen cadmium activates MAPK p38 (fission yeast Sty1 homologue) and triggers accelerated ubiquitination and proteolysis of Cdc20, which is essential for prometaphase arrest under SAC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Yen and Yang, 2010</xref>). Therefore, although different MAPKs might be employed to fulfil the task in yeast and higher eukaryotes, it is still possible that phosphorylation and regulation of Cdc20 levels by MAPKs is an evolutionarily conserved mechanism to adjust mitotic exit to extracellular or environmental stimuli.</p>

<title>Negative phospho-regulation of Cdc20 by MAPK as a spindle assembly checkpoint-dependent APC/C-inhibitory mechanism</title>
<p>APC/C activity can be regulated at multiple levels, Cdk1-dependent APC/C phosphorylation is one of the major prerequisites for APC/C activation and anaphase onset, in which Apc3 and Apc1 are key subunits for positive phospho-regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Fujimitsu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Kraft et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Qiao et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Steen et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>). However, it has been shown that Cdk1-dependent phosphorylation of APC/C co-activator Cdc20 lessens its interaction with APC/C, thus serves as a negative phospho-regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Labit et al., 2012</xref>). In addition to its phosphorylation by Cdk1, phosphorylation of Cdc20 by multiple other kinases, such as Bub1, PKA, MAPK and Plk1, has also been demonstrated or suggested in <italic>Xenopus</italic>, humans or budding yeast to be inhibitory to APC/C activation and improper anaphase onset upon SAC activation ((<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Jia et al., 2016</xref>) and reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Yu, 2007</xref>)). Therefore, Cdc20 generally serves as an integrator of multiple intracellular signaling cascades that regulate progression through mitosis.</p>
<p>Although multiple kinases have been proposed to be directly involved in phosphorylation of Cdc20 proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Yu, 2007</xref>), precisely identifying the <italic>in vivo</italic> phosphorylation sites in Cdc20 has turned out to be challenging, largely due to its protein scarcity and instability. Based on known Cdk1 core consensus (SP/TP), 9 residues in human Cdc20 were originally suggested as putative Cdk1 sites, but among them only Ser41 has been proven to be phosphorylated <italic>in vivo</italic> by mass spectrometry analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Kramer et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Yudkovsky et al., 2000</xref>). However, subsequent mass spectrometry analyses identified Ser41 as one of the Bub1 phosphorylation sites both <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> and another putative Cdk1 site Thr106 as one of the Plk1 sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Jia et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Tang et al., 2004</xref>). It is very likely that there are not as many genuine Cdk1 sites in Cdc20 as originally assumed. One supporting evidence is that mutation of only one (Thr32) of the three putative Cdk sites to alanine in N terminus of <italic>C. elegans</italic> CDC-20 is sufficient to phenocopy 3A mutant for accelerated APC/C activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Kim et al., 2017</xref>). Interestingly, Thr32 of <italic>C. elegans</italic> CDC-20 is conserved as Thr 59 and Thr68 in human and <italic>Xenopus</italic> Cdc20, respectively (see <xref rid="fig4S4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4-figure supplement 4</xref>). Based on two-dimensional tryptic phosphopeptide analysis, Thr68 in <italic>Xenopus</italic> Cdc20 has also been regarded as a MAPK target site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Chung and Chen, 2003</xref>). These studies in diverse organisms raised an issue that whether multiple kinases share the same phosphorylation sites in Cdc20? It would not be so surprising if it turns out to be the case eventually, at least for Cdk1 and MAPKs, because CDKs and MAPKs recognize the same core motif (SP/TP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Pinna and Ruzzene, 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>By purifying Apc15-aasociated fission yeast Slp1<sup>Cdc20</sup> proteins from checkpoint-arrested <italic>pek1<sup>DD</sup></italic> and <italic>pmk1</italic>Δ cells, we were able to identify Thr480 and Ser76 as <italic>in vivo</italic> Pmk1-relevant phosphorylation sites and three Pmk1-independent phosphorylation sites (S28, T31, S59) based on mass spectrometry analyses. All our identified sites except Thr480 are located in the N terminal disordered portion of Slp1<sup>Cdc20</sup> sequence, this is similar to the phosphorylation residues identified by biochemical and functional analyses in other organisms, in which the major phosphorylation sites all fall within the N-terminus of Cdc20 homologues. We further provided evidence that S28/T31 and T480 are phosphorylated by Cdk1 and Pmk1, respectively, both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. We noticed that there is a tendency for reported phosphorylation residues to be concentrated in the N terminus of Cdc20 proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Jia et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Tang et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Yu, 2007</xref>). However, due to the lack of clear sequence homology in their N-terminal and C-terminal tails between Slp1<sup>Cdc20</sup> and its Cdc20 homologues in higher eukaryotes (see <xref rid="fig4S4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4-figure supplement 4</xref>), it is impossible to certainly assign any identified sites from different organisms as homologous sites. But it is possible that multiple kinases modify shared sites in Cdc20, this collaborative effect may be especially helpful under adverse environmental stress. Nevertheless, all reported Cdc20 phosphorylation events constitute an APC/C-inhibitory mechanism, no matter what kinases are responsible for the modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Chung and Chen, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">D’Angiolella et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Jia et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Kim et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Kramer et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Labit et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Tang et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Yu, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Yudkovsky et al., 2000</xref>).</p>

<title>Coupling of phosphorylation and autoubiquitylation of Slp1<sup>Cdc20</sup></title>
<p>The current model of inhibitory signaling from Cdc20 posits that its phosphorylation either promotes the formation of MCC or inhibits APC/C<sup>Cdc20</sup> catalytically, both are required for proper spindle checkpoint signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Jia et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Labit et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Yamano, 2019</xref>). Interestingly, our current study suggests Slp1<sup>Cdc20</sup> phosphorylation by fission yeast MAPK Pmk1 may represent another critical APC/C-inhibitory mechanism in the spindle checkpoint through reducing the protein levels of Slp1<sup>Cdc20</sup>, which is achieved via autoubiquitylation-mediated degradation (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref>). This mechanism is distinct from that reported in <italic>Xenopus</italic> egg extracts and tadpole cells, in which phosphorylation of Cdc20 by MAPK is instead responsible for facilitated Cdc20 binding by MCC to prevent it from activating the APC/C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Chung and Chen, 2003</xref>). Actually, previous studies in fission and budding yeast have underlined the importance of accurate relative abundance between checkpoint proteins and Cdc20/Slp1<sup>Cdc20</sup>, which sets an important determinant of checkpoint robustness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Heinrich et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Pan and Chen, 2004</xref>). A benefit of allowing the association of MCC-bound Cdc20 with APC/C is to provide an opportunity for Cdc20 autoubiquitylation by APC/C, a process aided by APC/C subunit Apc15 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Mansfeld et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">May et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Sewart and Hauf, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Uzunova et al., 2012</xref>). Notably, the depletion of <italic>apc15<sup>+</sup></italic>restores Slp1<sup>Cdc20</sup> levels in <italic>pek1<sup>DD</sup></italic> cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>), consistent with the idea that Pmk1-mediated Slp1<sup>Cdc20</sup> phosphorylation very likely facilitates its autoubiquitylation. Indeed, our biochemical and functional analyses further establish K479 and K472 in Slp1<sup>Cdc20</sup> as two key residues directly involved in its ubiquitylation, which likely follows its phosphorylation, particularly at adjacent Thr480. Despite K485 and K490 are similarly located at C terminus of human Cdc20 and can be ubiquitylated and responsible for Cdc20 degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Danielsen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Mansfeld et al., 2011</xref>), there has been no reports on phosphorylation-modified residues in this region. However, although the sequence homology within N- and C-terminal regions between Slp1<sup>Cdc20</sup> and Cdc20 homologues in higher eukaryotes is extremely low, we do notice that there are several lysine-flanking serine or threonine residues within Cdc20 C-terminal tails of higher eukaryotes (see <xref rid="fig5S3" ref-type="fig">Figure 5-figure supplement 3</xref>), this raises a possibility that this region may be involved in phosphorylation-coupled ubiquitylation. Currently, we do not know how T480 phosphorylation accelerate ubiquitylation of K479 and K472 in Slp1<sup>Cdc20</sup>. It is possible that phosphorylation of Slp1<sup>Cdc20</sup> might alter the mode of Cdc20 binding to APC/C which becomes conducive to catalyze Slp1<sup>Cdc20</sup> ubiquitylation.</p>
<p>In summary, our studies revealed a distinct dual mechanism of MAPK-dependent anaphase onset delay imposed directly on APC/C co-activator Slp1<sup>Cdc20</sup> and an unidentified substrate, which may emerge as an important regulatory layer to fine tune APC/C and MCC activity upon SAC activation. Importantly, although this mechanism of APC/C regulation by two MAPKs has not been examined in other organisms, it is very likely widespread across eukaryotes including humans, given the involvement of MAPKs in general response to wide range of adverse environmental situations and similar regulations of APC/C and SAC in eukaryotes characterized so far. It is also plausible to assume that the MAPK-mediated APC/C inhibition pathway may also contribute to the pathogenesis of multiple cancers. Indeed, Cdc20 upregulation has been demonstrated in several types of cancers, including breast and colon cancer, and it contributes to aggressive tumor progression and poor prognosis in gastric cancer and primary non-small cell lung cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Chi et al., 2019</xref>). One very recent study conducted in human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) cell lines revealed that inhibition of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) led to dephosphorylation of Cdc20 and concomitant loss of APC/C target proteins securin and cyclin B (CCNB1 and CCNB2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Klomp et al., 2024</xref>). Because human ERKs are homologs of fission yeast Pmk1, the finding in this study supports a notion that very likely human MAPKs also negatively regulates APC/C through Cdc20 phosphorylation and the altered levels of Cdc20 in cancers are MAPK relevant. Nevertheless, inhibition of APC/C<sup>Cdc20</sup> activity or induction of Cdc20 degradation have already been listed as alternative therapeutic strategies to control cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Greil et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Jeong et al., 2022</xref>). Thus, although the detailed molecular mechanisms may vary, further studies on MAPK-mediated APC/C<sup>Cdc20</sup> inhibition mechanism in human would lead to better understanding of its oncogenic role in tumor progression.</p>

<p>To prepare APC/C for mass spectrometry analyses, Apc15-GFP was purified from 6-liter cultures of <italic>nda3-KM311</italic> arrested cells with desired genetic background. Cells were disrupted and cell lysates were prepared as described above for routine immunoprecipitation experiments.</p>
<p>For mass spectrometry analyses, purified samples were first run on PAGE gels, after staining of gels with Coomassie blue, excised gel segments were subjected to in-gel trypsin (Promega, V5111) digestion and dried. Samples were then analyzed on a nanoElute (plug-in V1.1.0.27; Bruker, Bremen, Germany) coupled to a timsTOF Pro (Bruker, Bremen, Germany) equipped with a CaptiveSpray source. Peptides were separated on a 15cm X 75μm analytical column, 1.6 μm C18 beads with a packed emitter tip (IonOpticks, Australia). The column temperature was maintained at 55 °C using an integrated column oven (Sonation GmbH, Germany). The column was equilibrated using 4 column volumes before loading sample in 100% buffer A (99.9% MilliQ water, 0.1% FA) (Both steps performed at 980 bar). Samples were separated at 400 nL/min using a linear gradient from 2% to 25% buffer B (99.9% ACN, 0.1% FA) over 90 min before ramping to 37% buffer B (10min), ramp to 80% buffer B (10min) and sustained for 10 min (total separation method time 120 min). The timsTOF Pro (Bruker, Bremen, Germany) was operated in PASEF mode using Compass Hystar 6.0. Mass Range 100 to 1700m/z, 1/K0 Start 0.6 V⋅s/cm<sup>2</sup> End 1.6 V⋅s/cm<sup>2</sup>, Ramp time 110.1ms, Lock Duty Cycle to 100%, Capillary Voltage 1600V, Dry Gas 3 L/min, Dry Temp 180°C, PASEF settings: 10 MS/MS scans (total cycle time 1.27sec), charge range 0-5, active exclusion for 0.4 min, Scheduling Target intensity 10000, Intensity threshold 2500, CID collision energy 42eV. All raw files were analyzed by PEAKS Studio Xpro software (Bioinformatics Solutions Inc., Waterloo, ON, Canada). Data was searched against the <italic>S. pombe</italic> proteome sequence database (Uniprot database with 5117 entries of protein sequences at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.uniprot.org/proteomes/UP000002485">https://www.uniprot.org/proteomes/UP000002485</ext-link>). <italic>De novo</italic> sequencing of peptides, database search and characterizing specific PTMs were used to analyze the raw data; false discovery rate (FDR) was set to ≤1%, and [-10*log(<italic>p</italic>)] was calculated accordingly where <italic>p</italic> is the probability that an observed match is a random event. The PEAKS used the following parameters: (i) precursor ion mass tolerance, 20 ppm; (ii) fragment ion mass tolerance, 0.05 Da (the error tolerance); (iii) tryptic enzyme specificity with two missed cleavages allowed; (iv) monoisotopic precursor mass and fragment ion mass; (v) a fixed modification of cysteine carbamidomethylation; and (vi) variable modifications including N-acetylation of proteins and oxidation of Met.</p>

<title>Ubiquitin affinity pull-down assays</title>
<p>For detection of <italic>in vivo</italic> ubiquitylation of Slp1<sup>Cdc20</sup>, strains all carried <italic>mts3-1</italic> mutation were used. sfGFP-tagged wild type Slp1 or Slp1 mutants were expressed in the genomically integrated form of <italic>P<sub>slp1</sub>-sfGFP-slp1(WT or mutants)::hyg<sup>R</sup></italic> in wild type, <italic>pmk1</italic>Δ or <italic>P<sub>adh11</sub>-6xHA-pek1<sup>DD</sup></italic>background. Cultures were first grown at 25 °C to mid-log phase and then shifted to 36 [for 3.5 hours to block cells in mitosis prior to harvesting and cell lysis. Ubiquitinated proteins were pulled down from yeast lysates using Tandem Ubiquitin Binding Entities (TUBEs) (LifeSensors, UM402) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The bound proteins were eluted from washed Agarose-TUBE2 beads and analyzed by western blotting using a mouse monoclonal anti-GFP antibody (Beijing Ray Antibody Biotech; RM1008). Cell extracts were also immunoblotted for GFP and Cdc2 as loading controls (inputs).</p>

<title>Statistical analyses and reproducibility</title>
<p>No statistical methods were used to predetermine sample size. Sample size was as large as practicable for all experiments. The experiments were randomized and the investigators were blinded to group allocation during experiments but not blinded to outcome assessment and data analysis.</p>
<p>All experiments were independently repeated two to more than three times with similar results obtained. For quantitative analyses of each time course experiment, ≥300 cells were counted for each time point or sample. The same sample was not measured or counted repeatedly. No data were excluded from our studies. Data collection and statistical analyses were performed using Microsoft Office Excel or GraphPad Prism 6 softwares. Data are expressed as mean values with error bars (±[standard deviation/s.d.) and were compared using two-tailed Student’s <italic>t</italic>-tests unless indicated otherwise.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This manuscript addresses two main issues: (i) do MAPKs play an important role in SAC regulation in single cell organism such as S pombe? (ii) what is the nature of their involvement and what are their molecular targets?</p>
<p>
The authors have extensively used the cold-sensitive β-tubulin mutant to activate or inactivate SAC employing an arrest-release protocol. Localization of Cdc13 (cyclin B) to the SPBs is used as a readout for the SAC activation or inactivation. The roles of two major MAPK pathways i.e. stress activated pathway (SAP) and cell integrity pathway (CIP), have been explored in this context (with CIP more extensively than SAP). Sty1Δ or pmk1Δ mutants were used to inactivate the SAP or CIP pathways and wis1DD or pek1DD expression was utilized to constitutively activate these pathways, respectively. Lowering of Slp1Cdc20 abundance (by phosphorylation of Slp1-Thr 480) is revealed as the main function of MAPK to augment the robustness of spindle assembly checkpoint.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The experiments are generally well-conducted, and the results support the interpretations in various sections. The experimental data clearly support some of the key conclusions:</p>
<p>
(i) while inactivation of SAP and CIP compromises SAC-imposed arrest, their constitutive activation delays the release from the SAC-imposed arrest (ii) CIP signaling, but not SAP signaling, attenuates Slp1Cdc20 levels (iii) Pmk1 and Cdc20 physical interact and Pmk1-docking sequences in Slp1 (PDSS) is identifies and confirmed by mutational/substitution experiments (iv) Thr480 (and also S76) is identified as the residue phosphorylated by Pmk1. S28 and T31 are identified as Cdk1 phosphorylation sites. These are confirmed by mutational and other related analyses (v) Functional aspects of the phosphorylation sites have been elucidated to some extent: (a) Phosphorylation of Slp1-T480 by Pmk1 reduces its abundance thereby augmenting the SAC-induced arrest (b) S28, T31 (also S59) are phosphorylated by Cdk1 (v) K472 and K479 residues are involved in ubiquitylation of Slp1</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(i) Cdc13 localization to SPBs has been used as a readout for SAC activation/inactivation throughout the manuscript. However, the only image showing such localization (Figure 1C) is of poor quality where the Cdc13 localization to SPBs barely visible. This should be replaced by a better image.</p>
<p>(ii) The overlapping error-bars in Cdc13-localization data in some figures (for instance Figure 3E and 4H) makes the effect of various mutations on SAC activation/inactivation rather marginal. In some of these cases, Western-blotting data support the author's conclusions better.</p>
<p>(iii) This specific point is not really a weakness but rather a loose end:</p>
<p>
One of the conclusions of this study is that MAPK (PMK1) contributes to the robustness of SAC-induced arrest by lowering the abundance of Slp1Cdc20. The authors have used pmk1Δ or constitutively activating the MAPK pathways (Pek1DD) and documenting their effect on SAC activation/inactivation dynamics. It is not clear if SAC activation also leads to activation of MAPK pathways for them to contribute to the SAC robustness. To tie this loose end, the author could have checked if MAPK pathway is also activated under the conditions when SAC is activated. Unless this is shown, one must assume that the authors are attributing the effect they observe to the basal activity of MAPKs.</p>
<p>(iv) This is also a loose end:</p>
<p>
The authors show that activation of stress pathways (by addition of KCL instance) causes phosphorylation-dependent Slp1Cdc20 downregulation (Figure 6) under SAC-activating conditions. Does activation of the stress pathway cause phosphorylation-dependent Slp1Cdc20 downregulation under non-SAC-activation conditions or does it occur only under SAC-activating conditions?</p>
<p>(v) Although the authors have gone to some length to identify S28, T31 (also S59) as phosphorylation sites for Cdk1, their functional significance in the context of MAPK involvement is not yet clear. Perhaps it is outside the scope of this study to dig deeper into this aspect more than the authors have.</p>
<p>(vi) In its current state, the Discussion section is quite disjointed. The first section &quot;Involvement of MAPKs in cell cycle regulation&quot; should be in the Introduction section (very briefly, if at all). It certainly does not belong to the Discussion section. In any case, the Discussion section should be more organized with better flow of arguments/interpretations.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This study by Sun et al. presents a role for the S. pombe MAP kinase Pmk1 in the activation of the Spindle Assembly Checkpoint (SAC) via controlling the protein levels of APC/C activator Cdc20 (Slp1 in S. pombe). The data presented in the manuscript is thorough and convincing. The authors have shown that Pmk1 binds and phosphorylates Slp1, promoting its ubiquitination and subsequent degradation. Since Cdc20 is an activator of APC/C, which promotes anaphase entry, constitutive Pmk1 activation leads to an increased percentage of metaphase-arrested cells. The authors have used genetic and environmental stress conditions to modulate MAP kinase signalling and demonstrate their effect on APC/C activation. This work provides evidence for the role of MAP kinases in cell cycle regulation in S. pombe and opens avenues for exploration of similar regulation in other eukaryotes.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors have done a very comprehensive experimental analysis to support their hypothesis. The data is well represented, and including a model in every figure summarizes the data well.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>As mentioned in the comments, the manuscript does not establish that MAP kinase activity leads to genome stability when cells are subjected to genotoxic stressors. That would establish the importance of this pathway for checkpoint activation.</p>

<p>We have replaced those pictures with a new set of representative images, which show clear presence or absence of SPB-localized Cdc13-GFP.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>We agree that the overlapping error bars may look ambiguous in most figures showing time course curves, this is due to the fact that all these data from a group of strains have to be better presented in a single graph to more directly compare the potential effects. We have been fully aware of the drawback of these figure representations, that is why we always presented the data corresponding two major time points (0 and 50 min after release) from all time course analyses in an alternative way, namely using individual histograms to represent the data from each strain with means of repeats, absolute values, error bars and p values clearly labeled. In particular, the data from time point 0 min can provide important information on the SAC activation efficiency. Generally, we placed those data and graphs in corresponding supplemental figures, such as: Figure 1-figure supplement 1C, Figure 1-figure supplement 2D, Figure 3-figure supplement 3, Figure 4-figure supplement 6B, Figure 5-figure supplement 1, and Figure 6-figure supplement 2.</p>
<p>In addition, as you have noticed, almost all time course data were backed up by our Western blotting data.</p>

<p>Based on our data from Mass spectrometry analysis, mutational analysis, in vitro and in vivo kinase assays using phosphorylation site-specific antibodies, we confirmed that at least S28 and T31 are Cdk1 phosphorylation sites. From our time course analysis of these phosphorylation-deficient mutants, it seems the mechanisms of Slp1 activity or protein abundance regulated by Cdk1 or MAPK are quite different. How these two or even more kinases coordinate to control Slp1 activity during APC/C activation is one very interesting issue to be investigated, however, as you have realized, it is indeed beyond the scope of our current study.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This study by Sun et al. presents a role for the S. pombe MAP kinase Pmk1 in the activation of the Spindle Assembly Checkpoint (SAC) via controlling the protein levels of APC/C activator Cdc20 (Slp1 in S. pombe). The data presented in the manuscript is thorough and convincing. The authors have shown that Pmk1 binds and phosphorylates Slp1, promoting its ubiquitination and subsequent degradation. Since Cdc20 is an activator of APC/C, which promotes anaphase entry, constitutive Pmk1 activation leads to an increased percentage of metaphase-arrested cells. The authors have used genetic and environmental stress conditions to modulate MAP kinase signalling and demonstrate their effect on APC/C activation. This work provides evidence for the role of MAP kinases in cell cycle regulation in S. pombe and opens avenues for exploration of similar regulation in other eukaryotes.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors have done a very comprehensive experimental analysis to support their hypothesis. The data is well represented, and including a model in every figure summarizes the data well.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>As mentioned in the comments, the manuscript does not establish that MAP kinase activity leads to genome stability when cells are subjected to genotoxic stressors. That would establish the importance of this pathway for checkpoint activation.</p>
<p>We understand your concern. We have followed your suggestion and performed further experiments to examine whether the absence of Pmk1 causes chromosome segregation defects. Please see our more detailed response to your point #5 in your “Recommendations for the authors”.</p>

<p>Please go through the reviews and recommendations and revise the paper accordingly. I think nearly everything is very straightforward and all issues raised by the two expert referees are fully justified. I look forward to seeing an appropriately revised manuscript.</p>

<p>
(i) Cdc13 localization to SPBs has been used as a readout for SAC activation/inactivation throughout the manuscript. However, the only image showing such localization (Figure 1C) is of poor quality where the Cdc13 localization to SPBs is barely visible. This should be replaced by a better image.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have replaced those pictures with a new set of representative images, which show clear presence or absence of SPB-localized Cdc13-GFP.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(ii) I reiterate the loose ends in this manuscript I have mentioned above. If the authors have already conducted these experiments, they should include the results in the manuscript to tighten the story further. (I am not suggesting that the authors must perform these experiments...if they have not).</p>
<p>(a) One of conclusions of this study is that MAPK (Pmk1) contributes to the robustness of SAC-induced arrest by lowering the abundance of Slp1Cdc20. The authors have used pmk1Δ or constitutively activating the MAPK pathways (pek1DD) and documented their effect on SAC activation/inactivation dynamics. It is not clear if SAC activation also leads to activation of MAPK pathways for them to contribute to the SAC robustness. To tie this loose end, the author could have checked if the MAPK pathway is also activated under the conditions when SAC is activated. Unless this is shown, one must assume that the authors are attributing the effect they observe to the basal activity of MAPKs.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Actually, our data shown in Figure 6B demonstrated that SAC activation per se cannot trigger activation of MAPK pathway CIP, because we did not observe any elevated Pmk1 phosphorylation (i.e. Pmk1-P detected by anti-phospho p42/44 antibodies) in nda3-arrested cells (Please see “control” samples in Figure 6B).</p>
<p>To corroborate this observation, we further examined the Pmk1 phosphorylation/activation in Mad2-overexpressing cells, and could not detect elevated Pmk1 phosphorylation. This data again lends support to the notion that SAC activation per se cannot trigger activation of CIP signaling.</p>
<p>We have added our newly obtained result in Figure 6-figure supplement 1 in our revised manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(b) The authors show that activation of stress pathways (by addition of KCL instance) causes phosphorylation-dependent Slp1Cdc20 downregulation (Figure 6) under the SAC-activating conditions. Does activation of the stress pathway cause phosphorylation-dependent Slp1Cdc20 downregulation under the non-SAC-activation conditions or does it occur only under the SAC-activating condition?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As you suggested, we have constructed cdc25-22 background strains with pmk1+ deleted or expressing Padh11-pek1DD to remove or constitutively activate CIP signaling, respectively. By immunoblotting, we followed the Slp1Cdc20 levels when cells went through mitosis after being released at 25 °C from G2/M-arrest at high temperature. We found that Slp1Cdc20 levels in pek1DD cells were only marginally reduced compared to wild-type cells, whereas we failed to observe any elevated Slp1Cdc20 levels in pmk1Δ cells. These results suggested that CIP signaling only plays a negligible role in influencing Slp1Cdc20 levels under the non-SAC-activation conditions.</p>
<p>We have presented our newly obtained result in Figure 2-figure supplement 1 in our revised manuscript.</p>

<p>Thank you for suggestion on the organization and flow for “Discussion”. We have reorganized our “Discussion” sections and moved the previous “Involvement of MAPKs in cell cycle regulation” to the section “Introduction” and rewrote the corresponding paragraph.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(iv) A minor point in this context:</p>
<p>In the cold-sensitive β-tubulin mutant, growth at 18C causes loss of kinetochore-microtubule attachments as well as the intra-kinetochore tension. Both perturbations individually can lead to the activation of SAC. This study does not distinguish whether MAPK involvement in SAC dynamics is relevant to one perturbation or another or both. It would be pertinent to briefly mention this point in the Discussion section.</p>

<p>As you suggested, we have added two sentences to briefly mention this point in our “Discussion” section.</p>

This work provides evidence for the role of MAP kinases in cell cycle regulation in S. pombe and opens avenues for exploration of similar regulation in other eukaryotes.</p>
<p>Although the data largely supports the conclusions, a major addition will be testing whether cells accumulate chromosomal or inheritance defects when MAPK Pmk1 is absent. It will be interesting to know that this mechanism of SAC activation contributes to genome integrity.</p>
<p>Some additions that can improve the manuscript are mentioned below:</p>
<p>(1) In Figure 1, the authors should also test the effect of constitutive activation of Spk1 to rule out the involvement of the PSP pathway.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>To meet your curiosity and requirement, we have constructed yeast strains expressing constitutively active <italic>byr1DD</italic> alleles carrying S214D and T218D point mutations under the control of the <italic>adh21</italic> or <italic>adh11</italic> promoters (<italic>Padh21</italic> or <italic>Padh11</italic> in short), i.e. <italic>Padh21-6HA-byr1DD</italic> and <italic>Padh11-6HA-byr1DD</italic>, respectively. We examined the expression of these <italic>byr1DD</italic> alleles by Western blotting, and tested the TBZ sensitivity of these alleles and also checked whether they affect the efficiency of SAC activation or inactivation. Our results showed that constitutive activation of Spk1 by overexpressing Byr1DD does not cause yeast cells to be TBZ-sensitive or affect the efficiency of SAC activation or inactivation.</p>
<p>We have added these new data in Figure 1-figure supplement 2 in our revised manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) The number of analyzed cells (n) should be mentioned in the figure legends in Figure 1D, and all other figure panels should represent similar data in the consequent figures.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have added the information on sample size for all experiments involving time course analyses.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) The authors should also use another arresting mechanism (e.g. nocodazole treatment) and corroborate the result in Figure 1C to rule out any effects due to the mutant.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Figure 1C in our manuscript actually shows our experimental design and not the result. We guess here you asked for alternative strategy to arrest cells at metaphase and confirm our results shown in Figure 1D.</p>
<p>We need to mention that, as a commonly used inhibitor of microtubule polymerization, Nocodazole is very effective in mammalian and human cells and also in budding yeast cells, but not effective at all in wild-type fission yeast cells. It has been found that Nocodazole is only active in fission yeast α- or β-tubulin mutants (please see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=Umesono+K&amp;cauthor_id=6887245">Umesono</ext-link>, K., <italic>et al</italic>., J Mol Biol. 168 (2): 271-284 (1983); PMID: 6887245; DOI: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1016/s0022-2836(83)80018-7">10.1016/s0022-2836(83)80018-7</ext-link>.) or multidrug resistance (MDR) transporter mutants (please see Kawashima, SA, <italic>et al.</italic>, Chemistry &amp; Biology 19, 893–901 (2012); PMID: 22840777; doi: 10.1016/j.chembiol.2012.06.008.). Therefore, this feature of Nocodazole has limited and restricted its routine use as a metaphase arrest or spindle checkpoint activation drug in fission yeast.</p>
<p>Instead, in order to achieve the spindle checkpoint activation and metaphase arrest, we took advantage of a metaphase-arresting mechanism involving Mad2 overexpression, which has been described and used previously (Please see He, X., <italic>et al</italic>., Proc Natl Acad Sci USA. 94 (15): 7965-70 (1997); PMID: 9223296; DOI: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.94.15.7965">10.1073/pnas.94.15.7965</ext-link>, and May, K.M., <italic>et al</italic>., Current Biology, 27(8):1221-1228 (2017); PMID: 28366744; DOI: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2017.03.013">10.1016/j.cub.2017.03.013</ext-link>). With this strategy, we could analyze the metaphase-arresting and SAC-activation efficiency by counting cells with short spindles as judged by GFP-Atb2 signals. We compared the frequencies of cells with short spindles in wild-type, <italic>pmk1Δ</italic>, <italic>sty1-T97A</italic>, and <italic>spk1Δ</italic> backgrounds after Mad2 has been induced to overexpress for 18 hours, and found that SAC-activating efficiency was compromised in <italic>pmk1Δ</italic> and <italic>sty1-T97A</italic> cells, but not in <italic>spk1Δ</italic> cells. This data indeed corroborated our result shown in Figure 1D and ruled out possible effects due to the <italic>nda3-KM311</italic> mutant.</p>
<p>We have added this new data in Figure 1-figure supplement 3 in our revised manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) It would also be helpful to assess SAC or APC/C activation with another cellular readout in addition to Cdc13-GFP accumulation on SPBs, at least for initial experiments.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Actually, Cdc13-GFP accumulation on SPBs has been routinely used as a reliable cellular readout for SAC or APC/C activation in the field. It was first developed and used by Kevin Hardwick lab in their paper (Vanoosthuyse V and Hardwick KG. Curr Biol. 2009, 19(14):1176-81. PMID: 19592249; doi: 10.1016/j.cub.2009.05.060.). This method was also used in a paper by Meadows JC, et al. (2011) (Dev Cell. 20(6):739-50. PMID: 21664573; doi: 10.1016/j.devcel.2011.05.008.).</p>
<p>In our previous study, we also employed a different strategy to assess SAC inactivation or APC/C activation, in which degradation of nuclear Cut2-GFP was used as a cellular readout (Please see S4 Fig in Bai S, <italic>et al</italic>., PLoS Genet 18(9): e1010397 (2022); PMID: 36108046; DOI: 10.1371/journal.pgen.1010397.). Cut2 is the securin homologue in <italic>S. pombe</italic> and therefore also a target of APC/C at anaphase. Our data in the above paper confirmed that the degradation of both nuclear Cut2-GFP and SPB-localized Cdc13-GFP shows similar dynamics when cells are released from metaphase-arrest.</p>
<p>As we described in our response to your comment #3, we employed short spindles visualized by GFP-Atb2 signals as an alternative readout for metaphase-arrest and SAC-activation in cells overexpressing Mad2. We confirmed that SAC-activation efficiency was compromised in <italic>pmk1Δ</italic> and <italic>sty1-T97A</italic> cells, but not in <italic>spk1Δ</italic> cells.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) The authors have shown a role for Pmk1 in controlling the activation of APC/C and, hence, cell cycle progression through metaphase to anaphase. One crucial experiment would be to check if pmk1Δ cells show an accumulation of chromosomal aberrations or unequal distribution when subjected to genotoxic stressors. That would implicate a direct importance on Pmk1's role in cell cycle arrest and genome maintenance.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As you suggested, we have constructed <italic>cdc25-22</italic> <italic>GFP-atb2+</italic> strains with <italic>pmk1+</italic> present or deleted, and treated cells with 0.6 M KCl or 2 μg/mL caspofungin to activate MAPKs and checked whether the absence of <italic>pmk1</italic> could cause defective chromosome segregation in anaphase cells. Indeed, we found that stressed <italic>pmk1Δ</italic> cells displayed greatly increased frequency of lagging chromosomes and chromosome mis-segregation at mitotic anaphase compared to similarly treated wild-type cells and also untreated <italic>pmk1Δ</italic> cells. This new data implicated a direct role for Pmk1 in cell cycle arrest and genome maintenance, especially when cells are exposed to adverse environment.</p>
<p>We have presented this new data as Figure 7 in our revised manuscript.</p>
