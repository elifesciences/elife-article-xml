<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In nature, animals live in association with a diverse community of microorganisms. These associated microbes, especially fungi and bacteria, perform a range of beneficial functions for their host, such as nutrient provision and immune modulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Ikeda-Ohtsubo et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Zheng et al., 2020</xref>). Some of these host-microbe associations are facultative and dispensable, while others are more important or even essential for host growth or survival under specific circumstances. Compared to symbioses between a limited number of specific species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Shigenobu &amp; Wilson, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Su et al., 2022</xref>), however, those that encompass a larger number of species are intricate and analytically challenging. Additionally, despite a growing number of reports documenting the presence of fungi in the mammalian intestine, including humans, our comprehension of their roles is still limited, with the exception of a handful of pathogenic fungi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Hallen-Adams &amp; Suhr, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Pérez, 2021</xref>). Moreover, the composition of these complex microbiota tends to change over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Moya &amp; Ferrer, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Qiu et al., 2021</xref>). Therefore, we focused on how the host sustains its life processes in such unstable environments.</p>
<p><italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> has made remarkable contributions to our comprehension of the regulatory mechanisms governing development, growth, and metabolism, which are highly conserved among animals. More recently, the fly has emerged as a valuable model for investigating animal-associated microbes. The microbiota associated with <italic>Drosophila</italic> comprise relatively few species, most of which can be cultured aerobically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Chandler et al., 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Grenier &amp; Leulier, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Lee &amp; Brey, 2013</xref>). Furthermore, germ-free or gnotobiotic animals can be easily prepared (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Ludington &amp; Ja, 2020</xref>). The aforementioned advantages of analysis enabled a thorough exploration of the role of <italic>Drosophila</italic>-associated microbes. Notably, lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and acetic acid bacteria (AAB) demonstrate the ability to enhance larval growth under nutrient scarcity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Shin et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Storelli et al., 2011</xref>). However, most researchers have examined only a single species or a limited number of bacteria. Additionally, most previous studies did not investigate the association with yeasts. Possibly, this is because live yeasts are either absent or present in very small quantities, due to antifungal agents added to the <italic>Drosophila</italic> laboratory foods. Instead of live yeasts, the foods typically contain heat-killed budding yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> as a major nutrient source, but this yeast species rarely coexists with <italic>Drosophila</italic> in the wild (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Hoang et al., 2015</xref>). Consequently, the relationship between <italic>Drosophila</italic> and its associated microorganisms has often been classified as facultative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Gallo et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Martino et al., 2018</xref>), and the role played by associated fungi has been largely overlooked.</p>
<p>In the wild, the presence of microbes is crucial for the developmental growth of <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae that feed on fruit-based food sources. <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> in its natural habitat feeds on fruits fermented by its associated microbes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Watanabe et al., 2019</xref>). Germ-free larvae cannot grow on fresh fruits alone, while inoculation with certain species of yeasts or bacteria promotes pupariation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Anagnostou et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Pais et al., 2018</xref>). These findings suggest that, in the wild, microbes provide vital nutrients for larval growth. While the bacterial roles have been extensively investigated, few reports have focused on yeasts; some studies described interspecies variation of yeasts with regard to their effects on larval growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Anagnostou et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Quan &amp; Eisen, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Solomon et al., 2019</xref>), but the underlying mechanisms have not been thoroughly explored. We therefore set out to address the following questions: (1) which species play a central role in food microbiota? (2) what are the essential traits that these species possess? (3) what microbe-derived nutrients are necessary for host growth?</p>
<p>To address these questions, we sampled fermented bananas that had been fed upon by wild <italic>Drosophila</italic> species. We collected the foods at two different timepoints, referred to as “early-stage” and “late-stage” foods, and demonstrated a dramatic shift in fungal and bacterial taxonomic compositions during fermentation. Regarding fungi, we observed that yeasts predominated in both stages, but the dominant species changed between the stages. Among bacterial species, Enterobacteriales accounted for a large proportion in the early stage, whereas LAB and AAB dominated in the late stage. We then isolated yeast and bacterial strains from the food samples and tested their ability to support larval development on a banana agar. <italic>Hanseniaspora uvarum</italic>, the predominant yeast species in the early stage, was able to support larval growth by itself. In contrast, most of the late-stage microbes tested did not efficiently promote larval growth when inoculated individually. However, we found that when the acetic acid bacteria <italic>Acetobacter orientalis</italic> coexisted with either LAB or late-stage yeast species, it effectively promoted larval growth. Our analyses of larvae under different microbial environments, including transcriptomic analyses of first-instars, strongly suggest that <italic>A. orientalis</italic> is potentially able to promote larval growth, although it requires interactions with other late-stage microbes. Finally, we investigated the molecular basis underlying the distinct larval growth-promoting effects among yeast species, including the supportive <italic>H. uvarum</italic> from the early-stage foods and non-supportive <italic>Pichia kluyveri</italic> and <italic>Starmerella bacillaris</italic> from the late-stage foods. Surprisingly, all the yeast species strongly promoted larval growth upon heat killing. This and additional results indicate that all species produce sufficient nutrients for larval development, but larvae cannot utilize those produced by the live non-supportive species. Our metabolomic analysis and metabolite supplementation assay suggest that only the supportive yeast cells can release critical metabolites for larval growth, including branched-chain amino acids, leucine and/or isoleucine. Collectively, our findings detail the core microbial species, their interactions, and the yeast species-dependent supply of nutrients that contribute to the development of <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae in nature.</p>

<title>The composition of both yeast and bacteria in the food microbiota shifts as fermentation progresses, independently of the presence of larvae</title>
<p>To examine the community structure of the microbiota associated with <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae in nature, we collected and analyzed fermented foods that had been fed on by wild larvae (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>, Table S1A). Because <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> and its related species are often found near human settlements, we set traps containing freshly peeled and sliced bananas outside of our residences so that wild flies would lay eggs on the foods. A portion of each fermented food sample was collected as “early-stage” food, while the remaining food was incubated in the laboratory. When the larvae reached the late third-instar stage, we collected further fermented “late-stage” food samples (refer to MATERIALS AND METHODS for experimental definitions of early- or late-stage foods). We performed sequencing of the fungal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region and the bacterial 16S rRNA region to analyze the composition of fungi and bacteria in individual samples, respectively (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>; Tables S2A and S2B).</p>

(A, C, and E) Designs of the samplings for microbial analyses. Traps with bananas were set up outdoors near human habitations in order to collect samples on which wild <italic>Drosophila</italic> spp. lay eggs. Fermented food samples were collected from the traps at two time points: the early stage (just after trap collection), and the late stage (when larvae in the foods developed into late 3<sup>rd</sup> instars). Collected samples are indicated in bold letters. (C) In this sampling, the collected early-stage food was crushed in PBS, and the liquid portion (microbial suspension) was added to fresh bananas with or without germ-free embryos (<italic>Cg-Gal4, UAS-mCD8:GFP</italic>). After incubation, late-stage food and surface-sterilized larvae were collected. (E) In addition to the food samples, adult flies in the traps and larvae from the late-stage foods were collected. This sampling was conducted independently from that shown in (C) and (D), although the sampling places were in common. Both adults and larvae were surface-sterilized. Note that all of the adults in the traps at Place 7 and Place 8 were collected, while 20 out of 37 were collected at Place 9.

</fig>
<p>In most samples, yeasts consistently accounted for a major proportion of the fungal communities (top of <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>; Table S2A), as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Chandler et al., 2012</xref>). At the family level, the compositions showed dramatic differences between the early and late stages; while Saccharomycodaceae dominated in most of the early-stage foods, Pichiaceae, <italic>Starmerella</italic>, and Saccharomycetaceae became dominant in the late-stage foods. The dominant bacteria also differed between the two stages, with Enterobacteriales predominating at the early stage and lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and acetic acid bacteria (AAB) predominating at the late stage (bottom of <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>; Table S2B). Henceforth, we refer to the transition from early-to-late stages in microbial composition as the microbial composition shift or simply the composition shift. In this sampling, we obtained, by chance, a “no-fly” trap; no adult flies were caught in the trap, and no eggs, larvae, or pupae were found in the food at either stage (“No-fly” in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>; “No-fly trap” in Tables S2A and S2B; refer to “Collection of fermented foods and wild <italic>Drosophila</italic> samples” section in MATERIALS AND METHODS for further details). We analyzed food samples from this trap for comparison. The microbiota in the foods significantly differed from that of other samples, with a lower percentage of yeast in the fungal community and a consistently high abundance of Enterobacteriales in the bacterial community.</p>
<p>A previous study showed that the presence of larvae influences the community structures of food microbiota (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Stamps et al., 2012</xref>). Therefore, we sought to determine whether the larvae contributed to the composition shift (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>; Table S1B). We prepared microbe-containing suspensions using newly collected early-stage foods and introduced them to fresh bananas, with or without germ-free embryos. We then incubated the samples and examined whether the microbial composition shifts occurred in the bananas. Remarkably, the composition shifts occurred similarly, irrespective of the presence of larvae, as indicated by the decreased proportions of Saccharomycodaceae yeast and Enterobacteriales bacteria, along with the increased proportions of Pichiaceae yeast as well as LAB and AAB (compare “Susp” with “w/o L” or “w/L” in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>; see also Tables S2C and S2D). These findings suggest that the composition shift observed in the food microbiota is unlikely to be solely attributed to the presence of larvae but more plausibly influenced by factors such as interspecies interactions among microbes.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we analyzed the microbial composition of adult flies captured in traps, as well as the food and larval samples (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>; Table S1C). This analysis revealed a similar composition of the yeast species in adult flies and early-stage foods, and a similar composition of yeast species in larvae and late-stage foods (top of <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>; Table S2C). However, notable dissimilarities were observed in the bacterial compositions between the <italic>Drosophila</italic> samples and the early-stage foods, primarily attributed to the conspicuous presence of <italic>Wolbachia</italic> sp. (Anaplasmataceae) and <italic>Gilliamella apicola</italic> (Orbaceae) in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> samples (bottom of <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>; Table S2E). Anaplasmataceae and Orbaceae are intracellular and gastrointestinal symbionts of insects, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Kwong &amp; Moran, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Werren et al., 1995</xref>), which plausibly accounts for their relatively lower abundance in the food samples.</p>
<p>In addition to the community structures, we investigated whether there were alterations in the overall abundance of yeasts and bacteria between the early- and the late-stage foods. For this purpose, we performed quantitative RT-PCR to quantify the copy numbers of fungal and bacterial rDNA in each food sample presented in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1B</xref>, 1D, and 1F (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Figure S1</xref>). The analysis indicated that there were no dramatic increases or decreases in copy numbers in most food samples. Note that measuring rDNA copy numbers in the microbiome does not necessarily reflect actual cell numbers due to variations in the genomic rDNA copy numbers among species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Lofgren et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Stoddard et al., 2015</xref>). Nonetheless, these results suggest that the quantities of microbes did not undergo substantial changes between the two stages.</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<title>Prominent acceleration of larval development is observed with early-stage-dominant yeast alone, as well as in combination with late-stage-dominant acetic acid bacteria and other microbes</title>
<p>As described in the previous section, we documented the presence of various yeast and bacterial species in fermented larval foods, the populations of which underwent notable compositional shifts over time. Previous studies suggest that different yeast or bacterial species contribute to larval development to varying degrees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Anagnostou et al., 2010</xref>; Consuegra, Grenier, Baa-Puyoulet, et al., 2020; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Pais et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Quan &amp; Eisen, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Solomon et al., 2019</xref>). Continuing this line of investigation, we undertook to identify which of the dominating microbial species in the early- or late-stage foods, either individually or as mixtures, promote larval development. To this end, we isolated fungal and bacterial strains from the food samples (refer to Table S3 and the “Isolation and species identification of microbes” section in MATERIALS AND METHODS for further details). We subsequently inoculated the isolated strains, either individually or in combinations, into a sterile banana-based food (banana agar), and introduced germ-free larvae. Thereafter, we evaluated the effects of the microbial species on the percentage and the timing of pupariation (see details in “Quantification of larval development” in MATERIALS AND METHODS). Note that on this food, larval development critically depends on associated microbes, as the larvae failed to pupariate on banana agar without microbes (“germ-free (GF)” in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref> and subsequent figures).</p>

<p>To assess the impact of microbes found in early-stage foods on larval development, we employed yeast strains belonging to <italic>Hanseniaspora uvarum</italic>, which dominated in the early-stage foods, or <italic>Pichia kluyveri</italic>, which was also detected in the foods (Table S2A; also represented by the darkest and the second darkest brown bars in the top of <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>), along with a bacterial strain of <italic>Pantoea agglomerans</italic>, which constituted the sole dominant bacterial genus (Table S2B; also represented by cyan bars at the bottom of <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). We investigated whether each strain or a combination of the strains promotes larval development (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2A</xref>, 2B, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">S2A</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">S2B</xref>). When inoculated individually, <italic>H. uvarum</italic> and <italic>Pa. agglomerans</italic> effectively promoted larval growth (“Y<sub>2</sub>” and “E” in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2A</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2B</xref>, respectively; “Y<sub>1</sub>” and “E” in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Figures S2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">S2B</xref>, respectively; see also <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), whereas <italic>Pi. kluyveri</italic>, another yeast species, had almost no promoting effect (“Y<sub>1</sub>” in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2A</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2B</xref>; “Y<sub>2</sub>” in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Figures S2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">S2B</xref>). When the strains were combined, we observed a significantly accelerated larval development in the presence of <italic>H. uvarum</italic> (“1: Y<sub>1</sub>Y<sub>2</sub>” and “3: Y<sub>1</sub>Y<sub>2</sub>E” in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2A</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2B</xref>) than in its absence (“2: Y<sub>1</sub>E” in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2A</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2B</xref>). Hence, in the early-stage foods, <italic>H. uvarum</italic> played a critical role in promoting larval development.</p>

<p>A similar feeding experiment was conducted using a total of five stocks of the late-stage microbes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2C</xref>, 2D <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">S2C</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">S2D</xref>; <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>): two dominating late-stage yeast species, the most predominant LAB and AAB species (Table S2B; see also green and orange in the bottom of <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>, respectively), and <italic>Pa. agglomerans</italic>, which persisted from the early stage, albeit in a smaller proportion (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). When fed individually, none of the yeast or bacterial species efficiently supported larval growth, except for <italic>Pa. agglomerans</italic> (lines and symbols with different brightness of gray in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>). Conversely, when larvae were fed mixtures, their development was almost equally efficient as long as LAB and AAB coexisted (color-coded in blues in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>). In this experiment, the coexistence effects of yeast and acetic acid bacteria were not tested. Therefore, we repeated the experiment using only one strain from each of the most dominant yeast, LAB, and AAB species (see the tables in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2F</xref> and S2F). Larval development, in terms of both the pupariation rate and timing, was promoted when the AAB <italic>A. orientalis</italic> was inoculated together with either a yeast (<italic>Starmerella bacillaris</italic> or <italic>Pi. kluyveri</italic>) or a LAB (<italic>Leuconostoc mesenteroides</italic> or <italic>Lactiplantibacillus plantarum</italic>) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">S2E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">S2F</xref>). This result suggests that, in the late-stage foods, the coexistence of AAB and other microbial species, yeasts or LAB, was critical for larval development. Additionally, we investigated the eclosion of pupae under different microbial conditions and confirmed that a majority of the pupae successfully eclosed, albeit with some variation observed across experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">Figure S3</xref>).</p>
<p>To summarize these results, strong promotion of larval development was observed when the larvae were associated with an early-stage yeast <italic>H. uvarum</italic>, or a combination of <italic>A. orientalis</italic> and other late-stage microbes.</p>

<title>During the late stage, acetic acid bacteria play a crucial role in supporting larval development through interspecies interactions among the microbes</title>
<p>To investigate how larvae respond to the different microbial conditions, we conducted whole-body RNA-seq of gnotobiotic first-instar larvae that were subjected to a 15-hour feeding period on banana agar (Table S4). The agar was either kept sterile or inoculated with yeast <italic>H. uvarum</italic>, LAB, or AAB individually, or a combination of LAB and AAB (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A-D</xref>). Remarkably distinct gene expression profiles were observed between the “supportive” conditions, where larvae efficiently pupariated in the previous experiments (”Yeast” and “LAB+AAB” in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>), and the “non­supportive” conditions, where larval development was markedly impaired (”LAB” and “GF” in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). Notably, a multitude of genes involved in metabolism and cell growth displayed significant upregulation in response to the AAB and LAB mixtures when compared to LAB alone (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3B</xref>, 3C, S4A, and S4B).

<p>Interestingly, although larvae fed on AAB alone largely failed to pupariate (“A” in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2C</xref>-<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2F</xref>), their gene expression profile after the 15-hr feeding period closely resembled that of the supportive conditions (compare “AAB” with “Yeast” and “LAB+AAB” in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). This result implies that AAB possessed the ability to induce a growth-promoting response, but the effect likely did not persist until pupariation. We observed that the growth rate of AAB on banana agar was notably lower compared to those of other microbes. This led us to speculate that this lower growth rate might result in a shortage of AAB, leading to undernutrition during the later stage of larval development. To test this hypothesis, we investigated whether larval development could recover when AAB was constantly available. Daily supplementation of AAB enabled larvae to pupariate as effectively as the initial co-inoculation of AAB and LAB did (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3E</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3F</xref>), demonstrating that AAB can promote larval growth if it is available throughout the course of development.</p>
<p>The aforementioned observations have prompted us to assume that yeast and LAB contribute to the stable coexistence of AAB and larvae. To investigate this hypothesis, we raised larvae on a diet containing AAB either alone or in conjunction with the other species. After a 4-day incubation, we quantified the abundance of AAB in each tube, including those in the food and those inside the larval body. In most of the combinations, co-inoculation with other species led to a 5-19 fold increase in the number of AAB colonies compared to the monoculture conditions (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3G</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3H</xref>). These findings suggest that AAB plays a crucial role in providing nutrients during the late stages of larval development, while other microbial species support a stable association between AAB and larvae.</p>
<p>Thus, none of AAB, LAB, or the yeast in the late-stage foods strongly promoted larval growth individually, while mixing AAB with LAB or the yeasts did (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2C</xref>-<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">S2C</xref>-<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">S2F</xref>). All of our results so far strongly suggest that these interspecies interactions among the microbes underlie the promotion of larval growth by late-stage microbiota.</p>

<p>When we provided each species to germ-free larvae, the larvae fed on <italic>H. uvarum</italic> showed the highest percentage of pupariation, while larvae fed on <italic>K. humilis</italic> or <italic>M. asiatica</italic> also pupariated at relatively high rates, albeit with a slower timing for <italic>M. asiatica</italic> (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4A</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4B</xref>). We classified these three species as the “supportive” yeast species. In contrast, larvae fed on <italic>Pi. kluyveri</italic> or <italic>St. bacillaris</italic>, which are the dominant species during the late stage, showed notably low percentage of pupariation, leading to their classification as “non-supportive” (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4A</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4B</xref>). Inoculation with <italic>Saccharomycopsis crataegensis</italic> or an laboratory strain of <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> BY4741 resulted in reduced percentages and delayed timing of pupariation compared to the inoculation with supportive species, thus earning the designation of “mild.” These results underscore the variable abilities of individual yeast species to promote larval development.</p>
<p>To investigate the response of larvae to different yeast species, we conducted whole-body RNA-seq analysis of larvae (Table S5). The overall findings closely resembled those obtained from various bacterial species (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4C</xref>-<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4F</xref>, S4C, and S4D; cf. <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3A</xref>-<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3D</xref>, S4A, and S4B). Gene expression profiles exhibited marked differences between larvae fed on the supportive yeasts and those fed on the non-supportive yeasts, with intermediate responses observed in larvae fed on the mild yeasts (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>). Feeding on the supportive yeasts upregulated genes involved in metabolism and cell growth (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4D</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4E</xref>), and the expression profiles under the supportive and the non-supportive yeast diets resembled those observed in fed and starved conditions, respectively (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>).</p>
<p>One potential factor determining the ability of larvae to develop on specific yeast species might be the production or secretion of adequate nutrients for larval growth. To assess whether each yeast species produced sufficient essential nutrients internally, we administered heat-killed yeasts to the larvae. Somewhat surprisingly, strong growth enhancement was observed in all seven yeast species upon heat killing, with <italic>Pi. kluyveri</italic> and <italic>St. bacillaris</italic> promoting larval development nearly as effectively as the supportive yeasts (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4G</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4H</xref>). We further explored the effect of killing the yeasts using banana agar supplemented with antifungal agents (10 mL/L 10% p-hydroxy-benzoic acid in 70% ethanol and 6 mL/L propionic acid, following the concentration described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Kanaoka et al., 2023</xref>), and observed similar growth promotion by <italic>Pi. kluyveri</italic> and <italic>St. bacillaris</italic> (data not shown). This finding suggests that all of these yeasts do indeed produce the requisite nutrients for larval development; however, it is likely that the nutrients produced by the live non-supportive yeasts are inaccessible to larvae (further analyzed in the subsequent section).</p>
<p>We also considered the possibility that the non-supportive yeasts somehow inhibited the host growth. To test this possibility, we cultured the yeast species on a nutrient-rich sterile medium and fed them to the larvae (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4I</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4J</xref>). This medium contains dry yeast and enables larvae to pupariate even without live yeasts (“GF” in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4I</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4J</xref>). Under these conditions, larvae fed with <italic>St. bacillaris</italic> pupariated as efficiently and nearly as rapidly as those without yeasts or with other yeast species, suggesting that <italic>St. bacillaris</italic> did not impede larval growth (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4I</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4J</xref>). In contrast, larvae fed with <italic>Pi. kluyveri</italic> exhibited a significantly reduced percentage of pupariation compared to larvae grown with the other yeast species or without yeasts. This could be related to the extensive growth of <italic>Pi. kluyveri</italic> on this food (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4">Figure S4E</xref>). Nevertheless, none of these yeast species reproduced the low percentage of pupariation of larvae observed on banana agar. Therefore, the inhibitory effects of <italic>Pi. kluyveri</italic> and <italic>St. bacillaris</italic> are less likely.</p>

<title>Supportive yeasts facilitate larval growth by producing nutrients, including branched-chain amino acids, and releasing them from their cells</title>

<p>In the yeast-conditioned banana-agar plates, which were anticipated to contain yeast-derived nutrients, many well-known nutrients included in a chemically defined synthetic (holidic) medium for <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Piper et al., 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">2017</xref>) were not increased compared to the sterile banana-agar plates; instead, they exhibited drastic decreases irrespective of the yeast species (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5A</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5B</xref>). The quantities of metabolites within the cells varied markedly among the species (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5C</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5D</xref>); while the supportive <italic>H. uvarum</italic> contained numerous known metabolites, it was intriguing that <italic>K. humilis</italic>, another supportive species, did not possess as many essential nutrients as other species, including the non-supportive <italic>Pi. kluyveri</italic> and <italic>St. bacillaris</italic> (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>). This result, in conjunction with the observations from feeding heat-killed yeasts (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4G</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4H</xref>), raises the possibility that the interspecies disparities in metabolites within living yeast cells do not directly influence larval growth. On the other hand, our analysis of the cell suspension supernatant revealed distinct variations in the known nutrients in the holidic medium between the supportive and non-supportive species (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5E</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5F</xref>). Among these, we focused on branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs), leucine and isoleucine (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5F</xref>). Previous studies have demonstrated that bacteria associated with <italic>Drosophila</italic> provide these essential amino acids to the hosts feeding on artificial diets lacking them (Consuegra, Grenier, Akherraz, et al., 2020; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Henriques et al., 2020</xref>; B. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Kim et al., 2021</xref>). In our analysis, suspension supernatants of supportive yeasts had concentrations of both leucine and isoleucine that were at least four-fold higher than those of non-supportive yeasts (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5F</xref>-<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5H</xref>; see also Table S6B).</p>
<p>The above finding prompted us to explore whether leucine and isoleucine are supplied by the associated supportive yeasts, similar to bacterial symbiosis. To investigate this, we supplemented banana agar with these BCAAs and inoculated it with the non-supportive yeasts, subsequently evaluating the restoration of larval development (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figures 6A</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6B</xref>). Remarkably, the supplementation of BCAAs elicited a significant improvement in larval development in the presence of the non-supportive yeasts, while it had no effect on larvae fed with the supportive yeasts (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figures 6A</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6B</xref>). At 12 days after egg laying, a significant increase was observed in the proportion of individuals that had progressed to the second instar or later stages (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>). These results suggest that the lack of BCAAs in bananas inoculated with the non-supportive yeast species is one of the causes of larval growth deficiency. Additionally, we explored the conservation of the biosynthetic pathways responsible for leucine and isoleucine among the isolated yeast strains. We performed <italic>de novo</italic> genome assembly and annotation for the six yeast species and examined the presence of orthologs (Table S7). This analysis, along with a subsequent RNA-seq analysis of the yeast species, revealed the conservation of the biosynthetic pathways of these amino acids across all the isolated yeasts (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>; Table S8). The result of this genomic analysis also strengthens the possibility that differences in the ability of yeasts to support larvae do not stem from variances in their ability to biosynthesize BCAAs, but rather in their ability to provide BCAAs in an available form to the larvae.</p>

<p>We noted, however, that the supplementation of BCAAs alone did not completely restore the growth of larvae that fed on the non-supportive yeasts.

We also supplemented the banana agar with other metabolites, including nicotinic acid and/or lysine and asparagine, which were detected in higher amounts within the suspension supernatants of the supportive yeasts, individually or in combination with the BCAAs. None of these additions had any effect on larval growth (data not shown). These results suggest that other crucial nutrients are provided by the supportive yeasts.</p>
<p>Regarding the mechanism of nutrient release, one possibility is their secretion from live cells, while another possibility is their leakage from dead cells. To address the latter hypothesis, we collected cells of the four yeast species from banana-agar plates and stained dead cells using Phloxine B (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figures 6D</xref>-<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6G</xref>). Noticeably more dead cells were found in the supportive <italic>K. humilis</italic> compared to other species (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6E</xref>), implying that nutrients leak from dead <italic>K. humilis</italic> cells into the food, which is subsequently utilized by the larvae.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we have shown that the composition of the microbiota shifts dramatically as fermentation progresses. Each individual microbial species plays a crucial and indispensable role in promoting host growth, either through the provision of essential nutrients or by establishing a stable association between the host and the nutrient-providing species (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6H</xref>). The capacity of yeasts to facilitate larval growth seems to rely on their ability to extracellularly release essential nutrients, such as leucine and/or isoleucine, thereby making these nutrients accessible to the host. These microbial functions have effectively empowered the host to grow on a nutritionally inadequate fruit.</p>
<p><italic>Drosophila</italic> has been known to co-exist with yeast and bacteria in nature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Chandler et al., 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Corby-Harris et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Cox &amp; Gilmore, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Quan &amp; Eisen, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Shihata &amp; Mrak, 1952</xref>). Our investigation reveals substantial shifts in both fungal and bacterial compositions during fermentation, which coincides with alterations in the species serving as nutrient sources. A previous study reported that <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae have profound effects on the community structure of yeasts in fermented bananas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Stamps et al., 2012</xref>). Our experiment, however, suggests that the microbial composition shift observed in our food samples is unlikely to be solely attributed to the presence of larvae but is more plausibly influenced by factors such as interspecies interactions among microbes. These discrepancies may be due in part to differences in experimental conditions such as larval densities, food sample volumes, or culture vessels. The initial microbial inoculation to foods is assumed to be mediated by adult flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Broderick &amp; Lemaitre, 2012</xref>). Our results imply that the inoculation leads to the dominance of <italic>H. uvarum</italic>, which can support larval growth on its own. Consequently, a microbially self-regulated transition occurred, leading to the dominance of microbial communities, including AAB, LAB, and the late-stage yeasts.</p>
<p>In the early stage of fermentation, both the predominant yeast and bacterial species were capable of supporting larval growth on their own. However, in stark contrast, at the late stage of fermentation, microbial interactions assumed a crucial role. While AAB provide sufficient nutritional resources to support larval growth, their growth rate on bananas is suboptimal. On the other hand, other associated microbes may lack essential nutrients for larvae but contribute to establishing a stable association between AAB and the larvae. Previous studies have reported interactions between AAB and LAB in artificial foods, where AAB act as a source of nutrients, including amino acids, while LAB provide lactic acid as a substrate for amino acid biosynthesis (Consuegra, Grenier, Akherraz, et al., 2020; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Henriques et al., 2020</xref>). Our findings have demonstrated that LAB also play a supportive role in the symbiotic relationship between larvae and AAB on a fruit, a natural food source of <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae. It is worth noting that interactions may also occur between the AAB and the late-stage yeasts. We observed the presence of various metabolites not only in the suspension supernatant of the supportive yeast species but also in that of the non-supportive late-stage yeast species. Therefore, the growth of AAB on fruits could be enhanced through the utilization of such metabolites by the bacterium.</p>
<p>In laboratory settings, yeasts are recognized and employed as important nutritional sources for <italic>Drosophila</italic>, providing essential nutrients such as amino acids, vitamins, and fatty acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Baumberger, 1917</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Broderick &amp; Lemaitre, 2012</xref>). In our study, we have demonstrated that during larval growth on their natural food sources, the associated yeasts contribute to the provision of BCAAs, leucine and/or isoleucine. Of these two amino acids, the availability of leucine acts as an effective regulatory signal for the mTORC1 pathway, as established in both mammals and <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Fox et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Gu et al., 2022</xref>; J. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Kim &amp; Guan, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Zhang et al., 2021</xref>). The mTORC1 pathway governs metabolism and cell growth in response to nutritional conditions. Indeed, the expression levels of numerous genes involved in these processes exhibited significant up- or down-regulation in larvae fed on supportive microbes compared to those fed on non­supportive microbes or germ-free individuals. Nonetheless, supplementing these branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) alone did not fully restore larval growth, suggesting that there should be other key nutrients. Our metabolomic analysis did not encompass some known metabolites, including lipids. Among these, sterols, substrates for ecdysone biosynthesis, are indispensable for larval growth. However, sterols are unlikely to be lacking in the fermented bananas. In our experiments, <italic>Pa. agglomerans</italic> and <italic>A. orientalis</italic> did promote larval growth, but most bacteria, including the two aforementioned species, lack the steroid biosynthesis pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Hoshino &amp; Gaucher, 2021</xref>). Therefore, larvae can grow on bananas without bacterial-derived sterols. Deficiency in other lipids is also unlikely, because larvae can grow on the holidic medium for <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> that contains cholesterol as a sole lipid component, and the developmental delay on the medium is rescued by a “critical element” which is “not a lipid” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Piper et al., 2014</xref>). Therefore, microbial nutrients that promote larval growth, whose functions have not yet been identified in this study, may be components other than lipids.</p>
<p>Despite the well-recognized importance of yeast as a source of nutrients, limited studies have reported the detailed process of how these nutrients are utilized by larvae. Our results suggest that for yeasts to serve as nutritional sources, they should not only produce the nutrients, but also release them outside the cells. The amount of nutrients released extracellularly varied among yeast species, which could be explained by varying abilities to secrete metabolites. Another possibility suggested for <italic>K. humilis</italic> was that this species is more prone to death on the culture medium, thus releasing more nutrients. Our metabolomic analysis of yeast-conditioned culture medium also suggested that the released nutrients do not accumulate in the medium but are likely to be eventually taken up and utilized by the yeast themselves. Further investigation is required to elucidate the nutritional dependence and competition between yeast and larvae.</p>
<p>Our results indicate that yeast cells are not necessarily digested in the larval gut, which might contradict previous reports. For instance, vegetative cells of <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> have been reported to be digested in the gut of adult flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Coluccio et al., 2008</xref>). However, the digestibility of yeast may vary depending on the species of yeast, diet composition, or developmental stage of the host. Indeed, a study has discussed the possibility that <italic>St. bacillaris</italic> is not digested in the larval gut (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Solomon et al., 2019</xref>). In our study, by focusing on the non-model yeast species associated with wild flies, we revealed part of the mechanism by which wild <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae utilize yeast as a nutrient source.</p>
<p>To date, the majority of studies on animal-associated yeasts have focused on a limited number of specific species that are either pathogenic or employed for fermenting foods. In this study, we have examined the species composition of yeasts that make up the symbiotic mycobiota of <italic>Drosophila</italic> and analyzed the roles of each predominant species by investigating their interactions with bacteria as well as with the host. To obtain a comprehensive and detailed understanding of the function of animal microbiota, future studies should further explore the contribution of associated yeasts.</p>

<title>Generation of germ-free larvae</title>
<p>Germ-free animals were prepared as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Watanabe et al., 2019</xref>) with minor alterations. Briefly, embryos were collected on apple agar plates topped with yeast paste, and were incubated at 25°C for 12-15 or 14.5-17.5 h. They were subsequently dechorionated in 50% bleach, followed by washes with sterile water, 70% ethanol, and sterile water once more. The embryos were placed on sterile agar plates and incubated at 25°C until newly hatched larvae were obtained.</p>

<title>Collection of fermented foods and wild <italic>Drosophila</italic> samples</title>
<p>Fermented food samples were collected using traps placed outdoors, near the authors’ apartments or houses in Kyoto and Osaka prefectures, Japan, or outside the laboratory at Kyoto University. Within each trap made from an empty milk carton, ripening bananas, freshly peeled and cut into small pieces, were placed in a sterile 100 mL centrifuge tube (Iwaki). 2.5 days later, wild flies were found in all traps except for one (no-fly trap). The traps were collected, and 3-5 mL of the foods (early-stage foods) were sampled. The remaining foods were incubated at 25°C, and 4-5 days later, when late 3<sup>rd</sup> instar larvae were seen in all foods except for the one from the no-fly trap, the foods were collected (late-stage). At the first sampling, we added germ-free embryos of GFP-expressing <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> laboratory strain (<italic>Cg-Gal4, UAS-mCD8:GFP</italic>) to obtain <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> larvae that were reared in the fermented food, but we could not sample them because most animals apparently drowned in the juice that seeped out of the fermented bananas.</p>
<p>To obtain early-stage-food suspensions, newly obtained early-stage foods were crushed in PBS, and after vigorous mixing, the liquid was collected carefully without taking banana, embryos, or larvae. 200 µL of this microbial suspension (or sterile PBS for Blank) was added to 100 mL tubes containing fresh ripening banana with or without ∼200 germ-free embryos (<italic>Cg-Gal4, UAS-mCD8:GFP</italic>). The samples were incubated at 25°C for 4 days. Late-stage foods were collected as described above. Larvae collected from the food were examined under a fluorescent microscope to make sure they were derived from the embryos we added and not from contaminating wild embryos. When sterile PBS was added to bananas instead of microbial suspensions in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>, the food showed no apparent change in appearance or odor during the 4-day incubation, and larvae in the food remained at the first instar stage. The amounts of microbes detected in such foods were less than those obtained for the food inoculated with the microbial suspension by 2-4 orders of magnitude (”Blank” in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Figure S1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">S1D</xref>; see details in the legend).”</p>
<p>All the food samples were collected after removing embryos and larvae, and snap-frozen. Larvae were surface-sterilized using the same procedure as embryo samples before snap-freezing. Adult flies in the traps were collected following different procedures depending on whether their microbiota were analyzed. When the samples were solely utilized for species identification, the whole bodies were stored in 100% or 70% ethanol. When we also required samples for microbial analysis, after washing the whole bodies in 70% ethanol, the head, external genitalia, and wings of each fly were removed and stored in 70% ethanol and subsequently used to identify the species. The rest of the body was snap-frozen and later used for the microbial composition analysis. Adult flies collected in each sampling are listed in Table S1.</p>
<p>All tools were sterilized prior to use. Frozen samples were stored at -80°C. Adult or larval samples collected from a single trap or food, respectively, were stored as a pool.</p>

<title>ITS or 16S rDNA sequencing analysis</title>
<p>Food, larval, or adult samples were freeze-dried for 2-3 days, followed by homogenization with 5 mm and 3 mm zirconium beads. Microbial DNA was extracted using a QIAamp DNA Stool Mini Kit (QIAGEN).</p>
<p>Library preparation, sequencing, and data analyses were performed by Macrogen Japan (Tokyo, Japan). For fungal analysis, the ITS region was amplified with primers ITS3 (5’-TCGTCGGCAGCGTCAGATGTGTATAAGAGACAGGCATCGATGAAGAACGCAGC-3’) and ITS4 (5’-GTCTCGTGGGCTCGGAGATGTGTATAAGAGACAGTCCTCCGCTTATTGATATGC-3’). For bacterial analysis, the V3–V4 region of 16S rRNA was amplified with primers 341F (5’-TCGTCGGCAGCGTCAGATGTGTATAAGAGACAGCCTACGGGNGGCWGCAG-3’) and 805R (5’-GTCTCGTGGGCTCGGAGATGTGTATAAGAGACAGGACTACHVGGGTATCTAATCC-3’). The amplicons were sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq sequencer (300 bp paired-end).</p>
<p>The paired-end reads were assembled using FLASH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Magoč &amp; Salzberg, 2011</xref>), followed by pre-processing and clustering using CD-HIT-OTU (clustering cutoff = 99%).

<title>Microbial culture</title>
<p>Microbes were cultured on MRS, YPD, PDA, or banana agar. MRS, YPD, and PDA were prepared using MRS Broth (Merck Millipore), YPD medium (Clontech), and Potato Dextrose Broth (Sigma-Aldrich), respectively, following the manufacturers’ protocol. Banana agar was prepared as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Anagnostou et al., 2010</xref>), with the addition of autoclaving after making the banana-agar mixture. 10% p-hydroxy-benzoic acid in 70% ethanol (prepared as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Kanaoka et al., 2023</xref>), propionic acid (Nacalai Tesque), cycloheximide (Wako), or ampicillin (Nacalai Tesque) were added after autoclaving.

<title>Isolation and species identification of microbes</title>
<p>Microbial strains were isolated on MRS, PDA, or banana-agar plates. The fermented foods were spread on each of these plates. Single colonies were picked and re-streaked on a plate, and after repeating the process once more, uniform colonies were collected, suspended in MRS liquid medium containing 40% glycerol, and stored at -80°C.</p>
<p>To identify the species of each strain, PCR and sequencing were performed. Microbial colonies were directly suspended in water in PCR tubes and heated (96°C for 5 min) before the addition of other reagents. In the cases when DNA failed to amplify, DNA was extracted using InstaGene Matrix (BIO-RAD) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. NL1/NL4 primers were used for fungi, while 27F/1492R primers were used for bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Chandler et al., 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">2012</xref>). The amplicon was purified prior to sequencing using a Wizard SV Gel and PCR Clean-Up System (Promega).</p>
<p>Sequencing was performed using an Applied Biosystems 3130xl Genetic Analyzer, and primers were NL1 for fungi and 518F (5’-CCAGCAGCCGCGGTAATACG-3’) for bacteria (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.macrogen-japan.co.jp/cap_seq_0104.php">https://www.macrogen-japan.co.jp/cap_seq_0104.php</ext-link>).

<title>Quantification of larval development</title>
<p>The microbes were individually grown on banana agar twice before being suspended in PBS (OD600 = 60). To mix multiple species, equal amounts of the suspensions prepared as described were mixed together. 10 µL of each suspension was added to ∼1.1 mL of autoclaved banana agar in 1.5 mL tubes. Tubes were incubated at 25°C for 2 days before larvae were added. The following procedure was performed as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Watanabe et al., 2019</xref>, with a few modifications. Briefly, 20 germ-free larvae were added to each tube, and the tubes were kept in a moisturized incubator (80-90% humidity) at 25°C. Pupariated individuals were removed from the tubes prior to eclosion, and either discarded or transferred to vials for further incubation until eclosion occurred. The number of pupae in each tube was counted until all larvae either pupariated or died. In experiments that require daily addition of AAB, the bacterial cells (∼3 mL by volume) were added daily except for those days when the cells added the previous days were still visibly left.</p>
<p>The effect on larval development was quantified as the final percentage of the pupariated individuals and timing of the pupariation. The developmental timing was quantified from the date on which the percentage of pupariation exceeded 50% of the final percentage of pupariation. Molds were occasionally seen on foods during incubation, in which case the tubes were removed from the experiment. On a rare occasion when the number of samples for a single condition fell below 3, all the tubes for the condition were excluded from the results.</p>

<title>Sequencing and annotation of yeast genomes</title>
<p>To extract genomic DNA from yeast cells for genome sequencing, yeasts were cultured on MRS plates. Collected cells were treated with Zymolyase-20T (Nacalai Tesque) to remove cell walls, and DNA was extracted using QIAGEN Genomic-tip 20G kit (QIAGEN).</p>
<p>The genomic DNA prepared from six strains was sequenced by both Illumina and Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) technologies. For Illumina sequencing, libraries were prepared with QIAseq FX DNA Library Kit (QIAGEN) and sequenced on the Illumina MiSeq platform (Illumina, CA, USA) to generate 2 x 301 bp paired-end sequence reads. MiSeq reads were trimmed using Platanus_trim (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://platanus.bio.titech.ac.jp/pltanus_trim">http://platanus.bio.titech.ac.jp/pltanus_trim</ext-link>). The thresholds for quality and read length were set at 15 and 25, respectively. After trimming, a total of 1.863 - 2.396 Gb sequence was obtained for each genome (average; 2.113 Gb). Sequence coverages estimated by GenomeScope (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Vurture et al., 2017</xref>) were over 100x for all genomes (103.42x - 210.48x). For ONT sequencing, libraries were prepared with Rapid Barcoding Kit (ONT) and sequenced using the R9.4.1 flow cell with the MinION platform, followed by base-calling using Albacore ver. 2.3.3. (ONT). Adapter sequences of MinION reads were trimmed with NanoFilt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">De Coster et al., 2018</xref>) or Porechop (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/rrwick/Porechop">https://github.com/rrwick/Porechop</ext-link>), followed by filtering with a quality threshold of 10 and a length threshold of 2000. After filtering, 84,598 - 197,215 reads (765 - 4,402 Mb in total sequence length) were obtained for each genome (average; 121,913 reads and 1,035 Mb). Estimated sequence coverages by MinION reads were 63.1x - 107.3x (average; 87.9x).</p>
<p>For RNA-seq analysis, equal amounts of yeast cells cultured under 6 conditions (2 temperatures: 25°C and 30°C, and 3 culture plates: MRS, YPD, or banana-agar plates) were mixed and used for RNA extraction. RNA was extracted as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Iida &amp; Kobayashi, 2019</xref>) and purified using the RNeasy mini kit (QIAGEN). Libraries for RNA-seq were prepared with NEBNext Ultra II Directional RNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina (NEB) and sequenced on the NextSeq 500 platform (Illumina) to generate 300-base paired end sequences which were used for annotation described below. A total of 23.48-26.75M reads were obtained for each yeast (average; 25.63M reads).</p>
<p>Genome assembly was performed by MaSuRCA v3.2.6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Zimin et al., 2013</xref>) using MiSeq and MinION reads. In the heterozygosity rate estimation by GenomeScope based on MiSeq reads, the <italic>Kazachstania humilis</italic> and <italic>Pichia kluyveri</italic> genomes showed higher heterozygosity rates (<italic>K. humilis</italic> ; 2.98%, <italic>Pi. kluyveri</italic>; 2.08%) while those of other genomes were 0.02% - 1,00%. In the assessment of autoannotated genome assemblies using BUSCO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Simão et al., 2015</xref>), completeness was over 86% in the four genomes other than the <italic>H. uvarum</italic> (64.58%) and <italic>St. bacillaris</italic> (75.21%) genomes. However, among the four genomes, those of <italic>Pi. kluyveri</italic> and <italic>K. humilis</italic> showed a high proportion of “Duplicated complete” genes (<italic>K. humilis</italic>; 27.74%, <italic>Pi. kluyveri</italic>; 5.17%, respectively), which was apparently due to the high heterozygosity rate of these genomes. Therefore, these two genomes were assembled using Platanus-allee v2.2.2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Kajitani et al., 2019</xref>), and by comparing it with the MaSuRCA assemblies using GenomeMatcher (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Ohtsubo et al., 2008</xref>), redundant sequences in the MaSuRCA assemblies were identified and removed from the assemblies. As the proportions of “Duplicated complete” genes estimated by BUSCO were 5.51% for the <italic>K. humilis</italic> genome and 0.74% for the <italic>Pi. kluyveri</italic> genome after removing redundant sequences, these redundant sequence-removed genome assemblies were used as the final genome assemblies of <italic>Pi. kluyveri</italic> and <italic>K. humilis</italic>.</p>
<p>Genome annotation was performed using FunGAP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Min et al., 2017</xref>) with the above-mentioned RNA-seq data obtained from each yeast.

<p>Mitochondrial sequences in each genome assembly were identified by tblastx homology search with fungal mitochondrial sequences obtained from the RefSeq database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">O’Leary et al., 2016</xref>). When multimerized mitochondrial sequences were generated in genome assemblies, they were trimmed to the smallest unit.</p>
<p>To determine gene orthology between <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and each of the isolated strains, blastp was performed. <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> protein sequence data (GCF_000146045.2_R64_protein.faa) was downloaded from NCBI genome database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome</ext-link>). Reciprocal best hits with an e-value &lt; 10<sup>-10</sup> were defined as orthologs.</p>

<title>Quantification of AAB</title>
<p>Microbes were inoculated onto 200 mL of banana agar in a tube included in a Biomasher II homogenizer kit (Funakoshi). After adding 5 germ-free larvae, the tubes were incubated at 25°C for 4 days. 150 µL of PBS was added to the tube, and food was crushed along with the larvae in it. More PBS was subsequently added to bring the total volume of the suspension to 700 µL. 1/5 serial dilutions were made, 50 µL of which were spread onto MRS plates supplemented with antibiotics (10 µg/mL cycloheximide and 10 µg/mL ampicillin to inhibit the growth of yeasts and LAB, respectively). The plates were incubated at 25°C, and 2 days later, colonies were counted to calculate CFU.</p>

<title>RNA sequencing for gene expression analyses</title>
<p>For larval RNA-seq analysis, microbes were inoculated on banana agar as previously described and freshly hatched germ-free larvae were added. After 15 h feeding, 20 larvae were collected and snap-frozen. RNA extraction, sequencing, and data analysis were performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Kanaoka et al., 2023</xref>).</p>
<p>Yeast RNA was extracted as described above, and sequenced as previously described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Kanaoka et al., 2023</xref>.

<title>Preparing samples for LC-MS analysis</title>
<p>The yeasts were individually grown on banana agar three times. 100 mg of cells were scraped from the surface of the plates and snap-frozen. To prepare yeast-conditioned plates, yeasts were grown as described and thoroughly removed by scraping; in addition, 22 mm<sup>2</sup> chunks of agar from the plates (∼100-160 mg) were collected and snap-frozen. 15 g/L agar plates or sterile banana-agar plates were prepared as controls and collected using the same procedure. To prepare cell suspension supernatants, ∼250 mg of yeast cells were collected as described, and sterile PBS was added at a ratio of 5 µL PBS per 1 mg of yeast cells. After suspending the cells, the suspensions were centrifuged at 5,000 rpm for 5 min. The supernatants were further filtered using a 0.45 µm Millex-HA filter (Merck) to completely remove any remaining yeast cells. 700 µL of each supernatant was collected and snap-frozen.</p>
<p>Each sample was suspended or diluted to 500 µL of methanol containing internal standard; 100 mM MES and 100 mM L-Met. After mixing with 250 µL of water and 400 µL of chloroform, the samples were centrifuged and the upper layer was collected and filtered using an UltrafreeMC-PLHCC for Metabolome Analysis column (Human Metabolome Technologies, #UFC3LCCNB-HMT). The samples were dried completely using nitrogen gas and resuspended in water before injection into the LC-MS system.</p>

<title>LC-MS/MS measurement</title>
<p>Cationic metabolites including amino acids and nucleosides are quantified using a triple-quadrupole mass spectrometer equipped with an electrospray ionization (ESI) ion source (LCMS-8060, Shimadzu Corporation) in the positive and negative-ESI and multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) modes. The samples were resolved on the Discovery HS F5-3 column (2.1 mm ID × 150 mm, 3-μm particle, Sigma-Aldrich), using a step gradient with mobile phase A (0.1% formate / water) and mobile phase B (0.1% formate /acetonitrile) at ratios of 100:0 (0–5 min), 75:25 (5–11 min), 65:35 (11–15 min), 5:95 (15–20 min) and 100:0 (20–25 min), at a flow rate of 0.25 ml min -1 and a column temperature of 40°C.</p>
<p>Data are presented as peak area values for each metabolite normalized by the internal standard. Those for the yeast-conditioned plates or cells were further normalized with sample wet weight. Heat maps were generated by MetaboAnalystR 3.3.0.

<title>Developmental progression with BCAA supplementation</title>
<p>Yeasts were cultured as described on autoclaved banana agar supplemented with 2.03 g/L of leucine (Nacalai Tesque) and 1.12 g/L of isoleucine (Peptide Institute), both at the concentrations included in the holidic medium with exome-matched FLYAA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Piper et al., 2017</xref>). 20 larvae were added to each tube, and after 11 days of feeding, live or dead individuals in each developmental stage were counted. Larval developmental stages were determined based on tracheal morphology, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Niwa et al., 2010</xref>).

<title>Imaging of dead yeast cells</title>
<p>Microbes were collected from banana-agar plates, suspended in PBS at a concentration of ∼1x 10<sup>8</sup> cells/mL, and incubated in 5 µg/mL Phloxine B (Wako) for 10 min at room temperature. The cells were subsequently washed twice with PBS and observed using a Nikon C1 laser scanning confocal microscope coupled to a Nikon Eclipse E-800 microscope. Note that the brightness of the images was adjusted with a gradation to achieve mostly uniform brightness, because the bottom side of the original images was darker due to microscope malfunction.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This valuable study analyzes the contribution of fungal and bacterial microbiota species to the growth and development of Drosophila. The authors use bacterial and fungal species associated with Drosophila in the wild to analyze their respective contributions in promoting larval growth in a decaying banana, mimicking the natural niche of fruit flies. They found that some fungal species and some fungus/bacteria combinations effectively promote growth by supplementing key branched amino acids in the food substratum. Production of these amino acids by Drosophila itself is not sufficient, and only fungal species that secrete these amino acids into the medium can sustain Drosophila growth. Thus, the authors clarify how facultative symbionts contribute to host growth in a natural setting by changing the food substratum in a dynamic manner.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The natural setting developed by the authors to analyze the impact of the microbiota is clearly valuable, as is the focus on the role of fungal microbiota species. This complements studies of Drosophila microbiota that have previously focused on bacterial species and used a lab setting. While there has been an extensive focus on obligate endosymbionts or gut symbionts, this study analyzes how facultative symbionts shape the food substratum and influence host growth. A last strength of this study is that it analyzes the contribution of Drosophila microbiota over a dynamic timeframe, analyzing how microbial species change in decaying fruit over time.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>1. The authors should better review what we know of fungal Drosophila microbiota species as well as the ecology of rotting fruit. Are the microbiota species described in this article specific to their location/setting? It would have been interesting to know if similar species can be retrieved in other locations using other decaying fruits. The term 'core' in the title suggests that these species are generally found associated with Drosophila but this is not demonstrated. The paper is written in a way that implies the microbiota members they have found are universal. What is the evidence for this? Have the fungal species described in this paper been found in other studies? Even if this is not the case, the paper is interesting, but there should be a discussion of how generalizable the findings are.</p>
<p>2. Can the authors clearly demonstrate that the microbiota species that develop in the banana trap are derived from flies? Are these species found in flies in the wild? Did the authors check that the flies belong to the D. melanogaster species and not to the sister group D. simulans?</p>
<p>3. Did the microarrays highlight a change in immune genes (ex. antibacterial peptide genes)? Whatever the answer, this would be worth mentioning. The authors described their microarray data in terms of fed/starved in relation to the Finke article. They should clarify if they observed significant differences between species (differences between species within bacteria or fungi, and more generally differences between bacteria versus fungi).</p>
<p>4. The whole paper - and this is one of its merits - points to a role of the Drosophila larval microbiota in processing the fly food. Are these bacterial and fungal species found in the gut of larvae/adults? Are these species capable of establishing a niche in the cardia of adults as shown recently in the Ludington lab (Dodge et al.,)? Previous studies have suggested that microbiota members stimulate the Imd pathway leading to an increase in digestive proteases (Erkosar/Leulier). Are the microbiota species studied here affecting gut signaling pathways beyond providing branched amino acids?</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this manuscript, Mure et al investigated host-microbe interactions in wild-mimicked settings. They analyzed microbiome composition using bananas that had been fed on by wild larvae and found that the microbiota composition shifted from the early stage of feeding to the later stage of the fermentation process. They isolated several yeast and bacterial species from the food, and examined larval growth on banana-based food, mimicking a natural setting where germ-free larvae cannot grow on it. The authors found that a yeast, Hanseniaspora uvarum, can support larval growth sufficiently, and insisted that branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) provided by the yeast may partly account for the growth support. Interestingly, in other isolated yeast species, some were non-supportive strains in terms of larval growth, which can assist larval development when they are heat-killed. Besides, they showed that acetic acid bacteria, isolated from well-fermented banana (later-stage food), is sufficiently supportive but their presence depended on other microbes, lactic acid bacteria or yeast.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>So far, host-microbe studies using Drosophila melanogaster have focused relatively less on the roles of fungi, and many studies used only &quot;model&quot; yeasts. In the experimental setting where natural conditions may be well mimicked, the authors successfully isolated wild yeast species and convincingly showed that wild yeast plays a critical role in promoting host growth. In addition, the authors provided intriguing observations that all of the heat-killed yeast promoted larval growth even though some of the yeast never supported the development when they were alive, suggesting that wild yeasts produce the necessary nutrients for larval development, but the nutrients of non-supportive yeasts are not accessible to the host. This might be an interesting indication for further studies revealing host-fungi interactions.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The experimental setting that, the authors think, reflects host-microbe interactions in nature is one of the key points. However, it is not explicitly mentioned whether isolated microbes are indeed colonized in wild larvae of Drosophila melanogaster who eat bananas. Another matter is that this work is rather descriptive and a few mechanical insights are presented. The evidence that the nutritional role of BCAAs is incomplete, and molecular level explanation is missing in &quot;interspecies interactions&quot; between lactic acid bacteria (or yeast) and acetic acid bacteria that assure their inhabitation. Apart from these matters, the future directions or significance of this work could be discussed more in the manuscript.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this manuscript, Mure et al. describe interactions between diet, microbiome, and host development using Drosophila as a model. By characterizing microbial communities in food sources and animals, the authors showed that microbial community dynamics in the food source are critical for host development.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This is a very interesting study where the authors managed to tackle a difficult question in an elegant manner. How the interactions between different microbial species within the microbiome shape host physiology is an area of great interest but equally challenging due to the complexity of intercellular interactions in complex, host-associated microbial communities. By using a simplified model and interrogating not only microbe-microbe and host-microbe interactions, but also the role played by diet, authors were able to identify significant interactions during fly development.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Despite describing important findings, I believe that a more thorough explanation of the experimental setup and the steps expected to occur in the exposed diet over time, starting with natural &quot;inoculation&quot; could help the reader, in particular the non-specialist, grasp the rationale and main findings of the manuscript. When exactly was the decision to collect early-stage samples made? Was it when embryos were detected in some of the samples? What are the implications of bacterial presence in the no-fly traps? These samples also harbored complex microbial communities, as revealed by sequencing. Were these samples colonized by microbes deposited with air currents? Were they the result of flies that touched the material but did not lay eggs? Could the traps have been visited by other insects? Another interesting observation that could be better discussed is the fact that adult flies showed a microbiome that more closely resembles that of the early-stage diet, whereas larvae have a more late-stage-like microbiome. It is easy to understand why the microbiome of the larvae would resemble that of the late-stage foods, but what about the adult microbiome? Authors should discuss or at least acknowledge the fact that there must be a microbiome shift once adults leave their food source. Lastly, the authors should provide more details about the metabolomics experiments. For instance, how were peaks assigned to leucine/isoleucine (as well as other compounds)? Were both retention times and MS2 spectra always used? Were standard curves produced? Were internal, deuterated controls used?</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>1. The authors should better review what we know of fungal Drosophila microbiota species as well as the ecology of rotting fruit. Are the microbiota species described in this article specific to their location/setting? It would have been interesting to know if similar species can be retrieved in other locations using other decaying fruits. The term 'core' in the title suggests that these species are generally found associated with Drosophila but this is not demonstrated. The paper is written in a way that implies the microbiota members they have found are universal. What is the evidence for this? Have the fungal species described in this paper been found in other studies? Even if this is not the case, the paper is interesting, but there should be a discussion of how generalizable the findings are.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The reviewer inquires as to whether the microbial species described in this article are ubiquitously associated with Drosophila or not. Indeed, most of the microbes described in this manuscript are generally recognized as species associated with Drosophila spp. For example, species such as Hanseniaspora uvarum, Pichia kluyveri, and Starmerella bacillaris have been detected in or isolated from Drosophila spp. collected in European countries as well as the United States and Oceania (Chandler et al., 2012; Solomon et al., 2019). As for the bacteria, species belonging to the genera Pantoea, Lactobacillus, Leuconostoc, and Acetobacter have also previously been detected in wild Drosophila spp. (Chandler et al., 2011). These elucidations will be incorporated into our revised manuscript.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the term “core” in the manuscript title may lead to misunderstanding, as the generality does not ensure the ubiquitous presence of these microbial species in every individual fly. Considering this point, we will replace the term with an expression more appropriate to our context.</p>

<p>1. Can the authors clearly demonstrate that the microbiota species that develop in the banana trap are derived from flies? Are these species found in flies in the wild? Did the authors check that the flies belong to the D. melanogaster species and not to the sister group D. simulans?</p>
<p>Can the authors clearly demonstrate that the microbiota species that develop in the banana trap are derived from flies? Are these species found in flies in the wild?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The reviewer asked whether the microbial species identified in the fermented banana samples were derived from flies. To address this question, additional experiments under more controlled conditions, such as the inoculation of specific species of wild flies onto fresh bananas, would be needed. Nevertheless, the microbes may potentially originate from wild flies, as supported by the literature cited in our response to the Weakness 1).</p>
<p>Alternative sources for microbial provenance also merit consideration. For example, microbial entities may be inherently present in unfermented bananas through the infiltration of peel injuries (lines 1141-1142 of the original manuscript). In addition, they could be introduced by insects other than flies, given that both rove beetles (Staphylinidae) and sap beetles (Nitidulidae) were observed in some of the traps. These possibilities will be incorporated into the 'MATERIALS AND METHODS' and 'DISCUSSION' sections of our revised manuscript.</p>

<p>Did the authors check that the flies belong to the D. melanogaster species and not to the sister group D. simulans?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Our sampling strategy was designed to target not only D. melanogaster but also other domestic Drosophila species, such as D. simulans, that inhabit human residential areas. After adult flies were caught in each trap, we identified the species as shown in Table S1, thereby showing the presence of either or both D. melanogaster and D. simulans. We will provide these descriptions in MATERIALS AND METHODS and DISCUSSION.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>Regarding the antimicrobial peptide genes, statistical comparisons of our RNA-seq data across different conditions were impracticable because most of them showed low expression levels (refer to Author response table 1, which exhibits the RNA-seq data of the yeast-fed larvae; similar expression profiles were observed in the bacteria-fed larvae). While a subset of genes exhibited significantly elevated expression in the non-supportive conditions relative to the supportive ones, this can be due to intra-sample variability rather than due to distinct nutritional environments. Therefore, it would be difficult to discuss a change in immune genes in the paper. Additionally, the previous study that conducted larval microarray analysis (Zinke et al., 2002) did not explicitly focus on immune genes.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>We did not observe significant differences between species within bacteria or fungi, or between bacteria and fungi. For example, the gene expression profiles of larvae fed on the various supporting microbes showed striking similarities to each other, as evidenced by the heat map showing the expression of all genes detected in larvae fed either yeast or bacteria (Author response image 1). Similarities were also observed among larvae fed on distinct non-supporting microbes.</p>

<p>Only a handful of genes showed different expression patterns between larvae fed on yeast and those fed on bacteria, without any enrichment for specialized gene functions. Thus, it is challenging to discuss the potential differential impacts, if any, of yeast and bacteria on larval growth.</p>

<p>1. The whole paper - and this is one of its merits - points to a role of the Drosophila larval microbiota in processing the fly food. Are these bacterial and fungal species found in the gut of larvae/adults? Are these species capable of establishing a niche in the cardia of adults as shown recently in the Ludington lab (Dodge et al.,)? Previous studies have suggested that microbiota members stimulate the Imd pathway leading to an increase in digestive proteases (Erkosar/Leulier). Are the microbiota species studied here affecting gut signaling pathways beyond providing branched amino acids?</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>Although we did not investigate the microbiota in the gut of either larvae or adults, we did compare the microbiota within surface-sterilized larvae or adults with those in food samples. We found that adult flies and early-stage food sources, as well as larvae and late-stage food sources, harbor similar microbial species (Figure 1F). Additionally, previous examinations of the gut microbiota in wild adult flies have identified microbial species or taxa congruent with those we isolated from our foods (Chandler et al., 2011; Chandler et al., 2012). We have elaborated on this in our response to Weakness 1).</p>
<p>While we did not investigate whether these species are capable of establishing a niche in the cardia of adults, we will cite the study by Dodge et al., 2023 in our revised manuscript and discuss the possibility that predominant microbes in adult flies may show a propensity for colonization.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>The reviewer inquires whether the supportive microbes in our study stimulate gut Imd signaling pathways and induce the expression of digestive protease genes, as demonstrated in a previous study (Erkosar et al., 2015). According to our RNA-seq data, it seems unlikely that the supportive microbes stimulate the signaling pathway. Figures contained in Author response image 2 provide the statistical comparisons of expression levels for seven protease genes between the supportive and the non-supportive conditions. These genes did not exhibit a consistent upregulation in the presence of the supportive microbes (H. uva or K. hum in Author response image 2A; Le mes + A. ori in Author response image 2B). Rather, they exhibited a tendency to be upregulated under the non-supportive microbes (St. bac or Pi. klu in Author response image 2A; La. pla in Author response image 2B).</p>

<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The experimental setting that, the authors think, reflects host-microbe interactions in nature is one of the key points. However, it is not explicitly mentioned whether isolated microbes are indeed colonized in wild larvae of Drosophila melanogaster who eat bananas. Another matter is that this work is rather descriptive and a few mechanical insights are presented. The evidence that the nutritional role of BCAAs is incomplete, and molecular level explanation is missing in &quot;interspecies interactions&quot; between lactic acid bacteria (or yeast) and acetic acid bacteria that assure their inhabitation. Apart from these matters, the future directions or significance of this work could be discussed more in the manuscript.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>The reviewer asks whether the isolated microbes were colonized in the larval gut. Previous studies on microbial colonization associated with Drosophila have predominantly focused on adults (Pais et al. PLOS Biology, 2018), rather than larval stages. Developing larvae continually consume substrates which are already subjected to microbial fermentation and abundant in live microbes until the end of the feeding larval stage. Therefore, we consider it difficult to discuss microbial colonization in the larval gut. We will add this point in the DISCUSSION of the revised manuscript.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>While recognizing the importance of comprehensive mechanistic analysis, this study includes all experimentally feasible data. Elucidation of more detailed molecular mechanisms lies beyond the scope of this study and will be the subject of future research.</p>
<p>Regarding the nutritional role of BCAAs, the incorporation of BCAAs enabled larvae fed with the non-supportive yeast to grow to the second instar. This observation suggests that consumption of BCAAs upregulates diverse genes involved in cellular growth processes in larvae. We have discussed the hypothetical interaction between lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and acetic acid bacteria (AAB) in the manuscript (lines 402-405): LAB may facilitate lactate provision to AAB, consequently enhancing the biosynthesis of essential nutrients such as amino acids. To test this hypothesis, future experiments will include the supplementation of lactic acid to AAB culture plates and the co-inoculating LAB mutant strains defective in lactate production with AABs, to assess both larval growth and continuous larval association with AABs. With respect to AAB-yeast interactions, metabolites released from yeast cells might benefit AAB growth, and this possibility will be investigated through the supplementation of AAB culture plates with candidate metabolites identified in the cell suspension supernatants of the late-stage yeasts.</p>

<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Despite describing important findings, I believe that a more thorough explanation of the experimental setup and the steps expected to occur in the exposed diet over time, starting with natural &quot;inoculation&quot; could help the reader, in particular the non-specialist, grasp the rationale and main findings of the manuscript. When exactly was the decision to collect early-stage samples made? Was it when embryos were detected in some of the samples? What are the implications of bacterial presence in the no-fly traps? These samples also harbored complex microbial communities, as revealed by sequencing. Were these samples colonized by microbes deposited with air currents? Were they the result of flies that touched the material but did not lay eggs? Could the traps have been visited by other insects? Another interesting observation that could be better discussed is the fact that adult flies showed a microbiome that more closely resembles that of the early-stage diet, whereas larvae have a more late-stage-like microbiome. It is easy to understand why the microbiome of the larvae would resemble that of the late-stage foods, but what about the adult microbiome? Authors should discuss or at least acknowledge the fact that there must be a microbiome shift once adults leave their food source. Lastly, the authors should provide more details about the metabolomics experiments. For instance, how were peaks assigned to leucine/isoleucine (as well as other compounds)? Were both retention times and MS2 spectra always used? Were standard curves produced? Were internal, deuterated controls used?</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>We collected traps and early-stage samples 2.5 days after setting up the traps. This time frame was determined by pilot experiments. A shorter collection time resulted in a greater likelihood of obtaining no-fly traps, whereas a longer collection time caused larval overcrowding, as well as adults’ deaths from drowning in the liquid seeping out of fruits. These procedural details will be delineated in the MATERIALS AND METHODS section of the revised manuscript.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>We assume that the origins of the microbes detected in the no-fly trap foods vary depending on the species. For instance, Colletotrichum musae, the fungus that causes banana anthracnose, may have been present in fresh bananas before trap placement. The filamentous fungi could have originated from airborne spores, but they could also have been introduced by insects that feed on these fungi. We will include these possibilities in the DISCUSSION section of the revised manuscript.</p>
