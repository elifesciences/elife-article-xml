<title>Abstract</title>
<p>We developed a 96-well plate assay which allows fast, reproducible and high-throughput generation of 3D cardiac rings around a deformable optically transparent hydrogel (PEG) pillar of known stiffness. Human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes, mixed with normal human adult dermal fibroblasts in an optimized 3:1 ratio, self-organized to form ring-shaped cardiac constructs. Immunostaining showed that the fibroblasts form a basal layer in contact with the glass, stabilizing the muscular fiber above. Tissues started contracting around the pillar at D1 and their fractional shortening increased until D7, reaching a plateau at 25±1%, that was maintained up to 14 days. The average stress, calculated from the compaction of the central pillar during contractions, was 1.4±0.4 mN/mm2. The cardiac constructs recapitulated expected inotropic responses to calcium and various drugs (isoproterenol, verapamil) as well as the arrhythmogenic effects of dofetilide. This versatile high-throughput assay allows multiple in situ mechanical and structural read-outs.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Cardiac tissue engineering (CTE) aims to generate <italic>in vitro</italic> cell constructs that recapitulate the intricate structural and functional properties of the native myocardium (<italic><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">van der Velden et al., 2022</xref></bold></italic>). As the heart lacks regenerative capacities, CTE emerged in the field of regenerative medicine with the objective of producing cardiac grafts that can be implanted in patients with heart failure (<italic><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Madonna et al., 2019</xref></bold></italic>; <italic><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Jabbour et al., 2021</xref></bold></italic>; <italic><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Eschenhagen et al., 2022</xref></bold></italic>). In parallel, the rapid development of biomaterials and microfabrication techniques, combined with progress in pluripotent stem cell biology have enabled the generation of miniature engineered heart tissues (EHTs) used as “hearts-on-chips” or cardiac organoids models. While these EHTs recapitulate a limited number of functions <italic>in vitro,</italic> they have provided essential platforms for cardiac disease modeling (<italic><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Filippo Buono et al.

(2019)</xref></bold></italic>). The EHTs are optimally formed by mixing human-induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC)-derived cardiomyocytes, fibroblasts, and/or other cell types such as endothelial cells to more closely mimic the structure and cellular complexity of native myocardium (<italic><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Giacomelli et al. (2020)</xref></bold></italic>; <italic><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Saini et al. (2015)</xref></bold></italic>). However, a major obstacle in the development of EHTs is the inevitable trade-off between the need for miniaturization to increase throughput (i.e. several organoids in each well of a 96- or 384-well plate) and the biological complexity of the tissues (<italic><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Cho et al. (2022)</xref></bold></italic>). The first EHTs were generated in small batches, using pre-designed molds, and having a millimetric size (<italic><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Boudou et al. (2012)</xref></bold></italic>; <italic><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Turnbull et al. (2014)</xref></bold></italic>; <italic><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Legant et al. (2009)</xref></bold></italic>; <italic><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Mannhardt et al. (2016)</xref></bold></italic>). Since then, two different avenues of development have emerged. On the one hand, to optimize throughput, more straightforward, low complexity assays such as spheroids were developed to obtain smaller tissues (<italic><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Beauchamp et al., 2015</xref></bold></italic>; <italic><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Polonchuk et al., 2017</xref></bold></italic>). These multicellular constructs are valuable models to study drug responses and the human heart micro-environment but they lack the geometric intricacy of a native cardiac tissue. On the other hand, the search for higher tissue complexity and maturity led to the development of chambered organoids (<italic><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">MacQueen et al. (2018)</xref></bold></italic>; <italic><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Li et al. (2018)</xref></bold></italic>; <italic><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Lee et al. (2019)</xref></bold></italic>). These constructs require the use of complex techniques such as bioprinting or the use of bioreactors, and tissues are generated one at a time, making these approaches time-consuming and impractical on a large scale. Therefore, the next step in tissue engineering needs to be directed towards high-throughput physiologically-relevant assays that are simple and straightforward for the end-user. Scaling down the tissue size to increase throughput, while controlling their geometry represents a major engineering challenge. Moreover in actual designs, many EHTs are attached on static posts that can impact tissue formation, result in isometric contraction and can interfere with optical acquisitions when made with opaque material.</p>
<p>Here, we report the development of a novel assay which allows fast, reproducible and high-throughput generation of 3D cardiac rings in a 96-well plate using hiPSC-derived cardiomyocytes. The design allows the formation of multiple ring-shaped cardiac tissues in a well. The EHTs form around a central pillar made from an optically-transparent and deformable polymer that enables <italic>in situ</italic> monitoring of the tissue contraction with simultaneous measurements of force generation.</p>

<title>Design and characterization of the molds</title>
<p>3D steel molds were designed to obtain a structure on which cells can be directed to ring-shaped cavities during sedimentation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The mold fits in the well of a 96-well plate, and consists of 21 identical conical structures with a central hole (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> left). The molds obtained from the manufacturer were imaged by scanning electron microscopy and found to correspond to the intended design (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, right). Casts of the mold were created in PEG to check the shape of the inner cavities of the mold, but the resulting structures were too soft to maintain their shape in air, and were transparent in water and therefore could not be imaged. More rigid polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) was cast from the mold to verify the shape of the resulting structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). These showed that the interior profile of the cavity was shaped in a reversed hourglass, as expected.</p>

<title>Generation and characterization of the gels</title>
<p>3D gel structures were obtained by adding a drop of PEG gel solution on top of the molds, inverting these onto a glass coverslip, polymerizing the gel and attaching the resulting sample on a 96-well plate. To determine the stiffness of the gels, a sample of the aqueous PEG solution was polymerized. A capillary was placed perpendicularly to the edge of the gel and negative pressure was applied to the gel through the capillary. The deformation of the gel into the capillary was measured and used to determine the Young’s modulus of the gel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1a">Figure 1 supplement 1</xref>). The values obtained (11.4±0.5 kPa) are within the physiological range for human cardiac tissue (<italic><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Gershlak et al. (2013)</xref></bold></italic>).</p>

<title>Generation of ring-shaped cardiac tissues</title>
<p>The efficiency of the differentiation of iPSCs into cardiomyocytes was in average of 96.9 ± 0.8 % (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1b">Figure 1 Supplement 2</xref>).Cardiomyocytes derived from iPSCs (iPSC-CMs) with fibroblasts were seeded on the gels. After centrifugation, the cells sedimented into the ring-shaped cavities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), and compacted around the pillars to rapidly form ring-shaped cardiac constructs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D-E</xref>). Initial tests with cardiomyocytes resulted in cell cluster formation and malformation of the rings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). To stabilize the tissues, iPSC-CMs were mixed with fibroblasts and different ratios of hiPSC-CMs to fibroblasts were tested in order to obtain the highest number of full stable cardiac rings with time. Three ratios of hiPSC-CMs:fibroblasts were tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) based on previous reports (<italic><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Tiburcy et al.

The 3:1 hiPSC-CMs:fibroblasts ratio was determined to be optimal and was used for all of the following experiments. Tissues started beating within 24 hours after seeding (Video 1). The rings compacted in time as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>. In these optimization experiments, we obtained an average of 10.75±0.48 tissues per well which were stable over time for at least 20 days with the 3:1 hiPSC-CMs:fibroblasts ratio.</p>

<title>Structure and organization of the engineered cardiac tissues</title>
<p>The 3D organization of the tissues was assessed by 3D immunofluorescence imaging 14 days after seeding. The fibroblasts are concentrated at the base of the ring in contact with the glass (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> - bottom panel), whereas the cardiomyocytes form a compact ring above the fibroblasts around the central pillar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> - top panel). Troponin T staining evidenced the formation of striated elongated fibers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>), which are typical of cardiac tissue. The obtained cardiac tissues are 75.5±1.8 μm high and their shape is toric, as shown in the 3D reconstruction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref> and video 1).</p>

<title>Contractility analysis</title>
<p>Tissues started contracting less than 24 hours after seeding, which was visible through the deformation of their central pillar (Supplemental video 1). Each tissue was recorded in brightfield imaging, at a 10X magnification with a high-speed camera (Supplemental video 1). An in-house Matlab code was developed to quantify the contraction and relaxation phases of the tissues by monitoring the area of the central pillar over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). The beat rate of the tissues first decreased between day 1 and day 3 and increased again to reach 0.58±0.030 Hz on day 14 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). The contraction stress developed by the tissues increased from day 1 until day 7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). At day 7, the contractility parameters stabilized with an average stress of 1.4±0.1 mN/mm<sup>2</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>.). The corresponding developed strain <italic>e<sub>A</sub></italic> was of 24.84±0.92 % (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS3a">Figure 3 supplement 1</xref>). Consistently, the relaxation and contraction speeds also increased during the first 7 days, then reaching a plateau (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">E</xref>).</p>

<p>We next evaluated the dose-response to increasing concentrations of several cardiotropic drugs. The changes in the beating parameters with verapamil concentration were found to be significant (p=0.0053 for the beat rate and p&lt;0.0001 for the other parameters). The addition of verapamil, an L-type calcium channel inhibitor, induced a negative inotropic effect until the complete stop of contraction at 10μM, as expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>).

The changes in the contraction stress and the contraction and relaxation speeds with isoproterenol concentration are significant (p=0.0004 for the contraction stress; p&lt;0.0001 for the contraction and relaxation speeds). Finally, dofetilide, which is an inhibitor of the <italic>I<sub>Kr</sub></italic> current, was also tested at different concentrations on the cardiac rings.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The combination of pluripotent stem cells technologies, advanced cardiomyocyte differentiation protocols and microfabrication methods have already resulted in the generation of engineered human cardiac muscle tissue-constructs, with different shapes and that can reproduce some cardiac functions (<italic><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Seguret et al. (2021)</xref></bold></italic>; <italic><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Cho et al. (2022)</xref></bold></italic>). However, until now, approaching the complex geometry and structure of the human myocardium required complex techniques, which limits the number of tissues produced, thus hampering their application for high-throughput experiments. In this study, we aimed to address this challenge by developing a novel strategy to create ring-shaped miniature cardiac tissues around a central pillar that is made from an optically-transparent and deformable polymer. Our main findings are as follows: (1) this novel strategy enables the fast and reproducible formation of an important number of cardiac tissues (up to 21 per well in a 96-well format) with a limited number of hiPSC-cardiomyocytes (112,500 per well); (2) In this assay, fibroblasts are essential to generate and maintain the tissue structure, with a 3:1 hiPSC-CMs:fibroblast ratio providing with the best yield of tissue generation; (3) The self-organized ring-shaped cardiac tissues contract and deform the optically-transparent central pillar, which can be recorded and analyzed to estimate the contractile force developed by the tissue; (4) these EHTs display concordant responses to positive or negative inotropes, and to arrhythmogenic drugs, as required for drug testing applications.</p>
<p>The miniaturized cardiac constructs develop by self-organization of the hiPSC-derived cardiomyocytes and fibroblasts, which are guided by a specific design to acquire a ring shape. The resulting EHTs are in a convenient 96-well plate format and easy to use for a user familiar with cell biology techniques. The 96-well plate format is adaptable to many plate readers and automated platforms. In addition, the optical clarity of the gels and the absence of gel directly under the structures ensures optimal imaging conditions. We showed that the tissues can be fixed, stained by immunofluorescence and imaged in situ at high resolution. Moreover, our EHTs would also be compatible with live cell imaging experiments with fluorescent reporters, such as calcium transients studies or conduction studies by optical mapping. While imaging the fluorescent reporter, the contraction parameters could be monitored through the deformation of the pillar. The possibility to simultaneously record two parameters represents a significant asset. The current design of our EHTs consists of up to 21 rings in a single well, thus providing many replicates within a single experiment, even if some of the rings fail to form due to biological variability. This high throughput can compensate for potential intra-batch effects. Moreover, the possibility to seed several wells at the same time allows to easily study several differentiations, compensating for the variability which is inherent to the differentiation of hiPSCs. The predictable circular shape of the tissues makes them easy to recognize and track using software. Coupled with the known organization of the 21 rings for easy automated imaging, a single well can quickly generate data on many tissues that is quickly and automatically analyzed. The EHTs we described here are thus easy to use, image, manipulate and obtain readouts from.</p>
<p>We found that the circular geometry of these self-organized cardiac tissues induces a homogeneous distribution of the cardiomyocytes and consequently of the contraction forces around the pillar and in the tissue. Importantly, the presence of the central pillar not only allows resistance to be felt by the tissue, but the control of its stiffness facilitates the calculation of the force developed by the tissue. Our results showed that the tissues develop a fractional shortening (or contraction strain) of about 25%, which is close to the contraction of a human heart (<italic><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Cheng et al. (2010)</xref></bold></italic>). The corresponding stress was 1.4 mN/mm<sup>2</sup> which is in a similar range to other previously reported tissue-engineered cardiac muscle models with hiPSC-CMs in the literature (<italic><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Seguret et al. (2021)</xref></bold></italic>; <italic><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Turnbull et al. (2014)</xref></bold></italic>; <italic><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Shadrin et al.

(2020)</xref></bold></italic>). Some studies have reported higher force values (<italic><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Ronaldson-Bouchard et al. (2018)</xref></bold></italic>) but in tissues that have a much large size than the tissues proposed here. The force generated by the adult human heart muscle, around 44 mM/mm<sup>2</sup> fora tissue strip (<italic><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Hasenfuss et al. (1991)</xref></bold></italic>), however remains significantly higher than the force developed by the currently available platforms. Few cardiac assays can precisely monitor the force exerted by the tissues. Indeed, cardiac cells seeded on micropillars (<italic><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Rodriguez et al. (2014)</xref></bold></italic>) and gels containing tracking beads (<italic><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Dou et al. (2021)</xref></bold></italic>; <italic><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Feyen et al. (2020)</xref></bold></italic>) provide information on local (subcellular) force exertion. The force measurements do not result from the concerted effort of an organized tissue composed of aligned cardiomyocytes, as proposed by ring-shaped tissues. Tissues attached on two posts (<italic><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Turnbull et al. (2014)</xref></bold></italic>; <italic><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Mannhardt et al. (2016)</xref></bold></italic>; <italic><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Abilez et al. (2018)</xref></bold></italic>) can also provide some information on the force generated by a tissue but the force exertion is not radial as it is in the native heart and the presence of the posts can impact the contraction by affecting the force distribution in the tissue and creating potential edge effects in the vicinity of the posts, inducing the formation of v-necks (<italic><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Abilez et al. (2018)</xref></bold></italic>). Lastly, some other ring-shaped cardiac constructs have to be transferred on posts or on a force transducer to measure their contraction force (<italic><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Goldfracht et al. (2020)</xref></bold></italic>; <italic><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Tiburcy et al. (2017)</xref></bold></italic>). Therefore, the easy <italic>in situ</italic> monitoring of the force generated by our ring-shaped tissues with an image analysis routine represents a significant advantage, as less manipulation improves the degree of standardization. Finally, the stiffness of the central pillar can easily be adapted to model a pathological increase or decrease of the extracellular matrix stiffness.</p>
<p>The EHTs we developed are composed of cardiomyocytes that rely on fibroblasts for their assembly and inter-cellular adhesion. Fibroblasts have been shown to play a prominent role in the heart as they are crucial in the constitution of the supporting extracellular matrix and contribute to cardiomyocyte electrical coupling, conduction system insulation, vascular maintenance, and stresssensing (<italic><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Ivey and Tallquist (2016)</xref></bold></italic>; <italic><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Baudino et al. (2006)</xref></bold></italic>). Other studies have highlighted the importance of a multi-cellular approach to generate EHTs (<italic><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Giacomelli et al. (2020)</xref></bold></italic>; <italic><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Saini et al. (2015)</xref></bold></italic>; <italic><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Amano et al. (2016)</xref></bold></italic>; <italic><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Caspi et al. (2007)</xref></bold></italic>). In our system, the fibroblasts additionally play a role in providing a basement support under the cardiomyocytes, in contact with the glass support of the EHTs. Immunofluorescence imaging showed an organization of the cardiomyocytes parallel to each other, perpendicular to the direction of contraction, with an increased alignment of sarcomeres. Our EHTs mimic the composition and organization of the native myocardial tissue, even if only composed of cardiomyocytes and fibroblasts. Future experiments will determine whether other, less abundant, cell types of the native myocardium, such as endothelial or smooth muscle cells, can further improve heart tissue modeling.</p>
<p>The constructs showed a spontaneous beating in the day following seeding and this activity was maintained over several weeks thus allowing contractile measurements and pharmacological testing in the conditions of auto-pacing. As a proof-of-concept, we studied the effects of well-established negative and positive inotropes and showed the ability of our platform to reproduce the anticipated effects. We observed that our tissues presented a positive inotropic response to increasing extracellular calcium concentration with a corresponding EC<sub>50</sub> which is in agreement with the values reported in the literature for engineered heart tissues made of hiPSC-CM, which are between 0.4 and 1.8mM for the EC<sub>50</sub> (<italic><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Feric and Radisic (2016)</xref></bold></italic>; <italic><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Schaaf et al.

(2020)</xref></bold></italic>). The negative inotropic response to increasing concentrations of verapamil of our constructs was also described in the literature and our IC<sub>50</sub> value is also in the range of reported values in other EHTs: Turnbull et al. <bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Turnbull et al. (2014)</xref></italic></bold> found IC<sub>50</sub>=0.61 μM and other papers range from 0.3 μM to 0.6 μM (<italic><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Mannhardt et al. (2016)</xref></bold></italic>; <italic><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Thavandiran (2019)</xref></bold></italic>). The <italic>β</italic>-adrenergic stimulation of the tissues with increasing concentrations of isoproterenol-induced a trend towards increase in the contraction force and significantly increased contraction and relaxation speeds without change in the beat rate. This is in line with what has been shown by <bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Goldfracht et al. (2020)</xref></italic></bold> and <italic><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Zhao et al. (2019)</xref></bold></italic>. Last, applying increasing dofetilide concentrations on our constructs showed a decrease in the contraction amplitude and contraction and relaxation speeds. This is in line with the literature as Zhao et al. <bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Zhao et al. (2019)</xref></italic></bold> depicted a significant reduction of the action potential amplitude of the tissues above a concentration of dofetilide of 10 nM. By assessing the beating regularity by plotting each period as a function of the previous one, we highlighted an increasing number of erratic beats with the increase in dofetilide concentration. Other papers have also underlined the pro-arrhythmic effect of dofetilide on cardiomyocytes derived from iPSCs (<italic><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Goldfracht et al. (2019)</xref></bold></italic>; <italic><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Patel et al. (2019)</xref></bold></italic>; <italic><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Altrocchi et al. (2020)</xref></bold></italic>; <italic><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Blinova et al. (2017)</xref></bold></italic>). Therefore, we demonstrated that our platform recapitulated the expected cardiac responses to several inotropes and arrhythmogenic drugs.</p>
<p>While representing a significant improvement, our platform presents some limitations. First, the size of the rings is very small compared to native tissue (400 μm). This size limitation is necessary for the purposes of high throughput screening, but for applications requiring larger tissues, wider rings can be considered in the future. Second, all measurements were performed under spontaneous pacing as a specific technique should be developed to allow external pacing of the tissues in the 96-well format. This includes electrical field stimulation or an optogenetics system with light stimulation. The precise and regular organization of the rings in the well makes this design very amenable to the introduction of microelectrodes for pacing, which could also allow the measurement of the action potentials of individual micro-tissues. Nevertheless, our main results show that pharmacological responses, including the detection of the pro-arrhythmogenic effects of dofetilide, were correctly measured under spontaneous beating conditions. Third, the miniaturized format of our platform creates some limitations and challenges regarding some ex-periments, including tissue stretching. Therefore, the length-tension relationships (Franck-Starling mechanism) were not determined in our tissues.</p>
<p>Overall the novel platform we describe here is a versatile, easy-to-use and high-throughput tool to generate cardiac rings in a reproducible way and analyze them <italic>in situ.</italic> This platform will be useful in several cardiac research fields, including disease modeling and pharmacological testing.</p>

A hollow glass capillary with an inner diameter 0.75mm (World Precision Instruments, USA) was attached to a platform movable in the xy-plane which was used to position the capillary right next to the edge of the circular polymerized hydrogel. Once the capillary and the hydrogel made contact, a negative pressure was applied, using the Cobalt autonomous pressure pump (Elvesys, France), creating a small convexity in the surface of the hydrogel.

<title>Response to increasing extracellular calcium concentration and drug tests</title>
<p>Tissues response to different drugs and increasing calcium concentrations was assessed after day 14. For the increasing extracellular calcium concentrations, tissues were first changed to Tyrode solution 0.5 mM in calcium (NaCl 140 mM, KCl 5 mM, 10 mM Hepes, Glucose 10 mM, MgCl<sub>2</sub> 1 mM, CaCl<sub>2</sub> 0.5 mM, pH 7.4) and let to equilibrate for 30 minutes at 37°C, 5 % CO2. Calcium concentration was then increased by sequential addition of a Tyrode solution at 10mM in calcium. After each addition, the tissues were incubated for 5 minutes before recording. For drug tests, tissues were changed to Tyrode solution at 1.8mM in calcium (NaCl 14 mM, KCl 5 mM, 10 mM Hepes, Glucose 10 mM, MgCl<sub>2</sub> 1 mM, CaCl<sub>2</sub> 1.8 mM, pH 7.4) and let to equilibrate for 30 minutes at 37°C, 5% CO2. To evaluate the dose-response of the cardiac rings to the different drugs (Verapamil-sigma v0100000, isoproterenol - sigma 1351005, dofetilide - sigma PZ0016), the contractility was first recorded for 30 seconds in basal state and the drug was then added sequentially. Between each addition of drug, the tissues were incubated for 5 minutes at 37°C before being recorded for 30 seconds.</p>

<title>Immunofluorescence staining and confocal microscopy</title>
<p>Tissues were fixed at day 15 with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 minutes and rinsed 3 times in PBS for 5 minutes. They were then blocked and permeabilized with blocking solution(BSA 2%, Triton 0.5%) at 4°C overnight. Primary antibodies Vimentin diluted at 1:250 (MA5-11883, ThermoFischer Scientific) and Troponin T diluted at 1:500 (ab45932, Abcam) were added the next day and incubated at 4°C overnight. Tissues were rinsed 3 times in PBS for 5 minutes and secondary antibodies (Alexa Fluor secondary antibodies, LifeTechnologies, at 1:1000) and DAPI diluted at 1:1000 were added and incubated at 4°C overnight. Immunostaining pictures were taken with a Leica SP8 confocal system.</p>

<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>All numerical results are expressed as mean ± standard error mean (SEM) of three independent experiments. Differences between experimental groups were analyzed with the appropriate statistical tests, specified each time. P values &lt; 0.05 were considered significant for all statistical tests. Statistical analyses were performed with GraphPad Prism software.</p>

<p>The manuscript provides <bold>valuable</bold> findings that will have practical implications for high throughput cultivation of cardiac tissues. The results demonstrate <bold>convincing</bold> evidence regarding the ability to create functional cardiac tissues and maintain them over periods of days to weeks. Improving the success rate of tissue integrity over longer periods of time, reproducing the physiological isoproterenol response and studying the impulse propagation in the tissues would garner a further broad interest for the platform.</p>

<p>The manuscript, &quot;A versatile high-throughput assay based on 3D ring-shaped cardiac tissues generated from human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes&quot; developed a unique culture platform with PEG hydrogel that facilitates the in-situ measurement of contractile dynamics of the engineered cardiac rings. The authors optimized the tissue seeding conditions, demonstrated tissue morphology with expressions of cardiac and fibroblast markers, mathematically modeled the equation to derive contractile forces and other parameters based on imaging analysis, and ended by testing several compounds with known cardiac responses.</p>
<p>To strengthen the paper, the following comments should be considered:</p>
<p>1. This paper provided an intriguing platform that creates miniature cardiac rings with merely thousands of CMs per tissue in a 96-well plate format. The shape of the ring and the squeezing motion can recapitulate the contraction of the cardiac chamber to a certain degree. However, Thavandiran et al (PNAS 2013) created a larger version of the cardiac ring and found the electrical propagation revealed spontaneous infinite loop-like cycles of activation propagation traversing the ring. This model was used to mimic a reentrant wave during arrhythmia. Therefore, it presents great concerns if a large number of cardiac tissues experience arrhythmia by geometry-induced re-entry current and cannot be used as a healthy tissue model. It would be interesting to see the impulse propagation/calcium transient on these miniature cardiac rings and evaluate the % of arrhythmia occurrence.</p>
<p>2. The platform can produce 21 cardiac rings per well in 96-well plates. The throughput has been the highest among competing platforms. The resulting tissues have good sarcomere striation due to the strain from the pillars. Now the emerging questions are culture longevity and reproducibility among tissues. According to Figure 1E, there was uneven ring formation around the pillar, which leads to the tissue thinning and breaking off. There is only 50% survival after 20 days of culture in the optimized seeding group. Is there any way to improve it? The tissues had two compartments, cardiac and fibroblast-rich regions, where fibroblasts are responsible for maintaining the attachment to the glass slides. Do the cardiac rings detach from the glass slides and roll up? The SD of the force measurement is a quarter of the value, which is not ideal with such a high replicate number. As the platform utilizes imaging analysis to derive contractile dynamics, calibration should be done based on the angle and the distance of the camera lens to the individual tissues to reduce the error. On the other hand, how reproducible of the pillars? It is highly recommended to mechanically evaluate the consistency of the hydrogel-based pillars across different wells and within the wells to understand the variance.</p>
<p>3. Does the platform allow the observation of non-synchronized beating when testing with compounds? This can be extremely important as the intended applications of this platform are drug testing and cardiac disease modeling. The author should elaborate on the method in the manuscript and explain the obtained results in detail.</p>
<p>4. The results of drug testing are interesting. Isoproterenol is typically causing positive chronotropic and positive inotropic responses, where inotropic responses are difficult to obtain due to low tissue maturity. It is inconsistent with other reported results that cardiac rings do not exhibit increased beating frequency, but slightly increased forces only. Zhao et al were using electrical pacing at a defined rate during force measurement, whereas the ring constructs are not.</p>
<p>Overall, the manuscript is well written and the designed platform presented the unique advantages of high throughput cardiac tissue culture. Besides the contractile dynamics and IHC images, the paper lacks other cardiac functional evaluations, such as calcium handling, impulse propagation, and/or electrophysiology. The culture reproducibility (high SD) and longevity (&lt;20 days) still remain unsolved.</p>

<p>The manuscript, &quot;A versatile high-throughput assay based on 3D ring-shaped cardiac tissues generated from human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes&quot; developed a unique culture platform with PEG hydrogel that facilitates the in-situ measurement of contractile dynamics of the engineered cardiac rings. The authors optimized the tissue seeding conditions, demonstrated tissue morphology with expressions of cardiac and fibroblast markers, mathematically modeled the equation to derive contractile forces and other parameters based on imaging analysis, and ended by testing several compounds with known cardiac responses.</p>
<p>To strengthen the paper, the following comments should be considered:</p>
<p>1. This paper provided an intriguing platform that creates miniature cardiac rings with merely thousands of CMs per tissue in a 96-well plate format. The shape of the ring and the squeezing motion can recapitulate the contraction of the cardiac chamber to a certain degree. However, Thavandiran et al (PNAS 2013) created a larger version of the cardiac ring and found the electrical propagation revealed spontaneous infinite loop-like cycles of activation propagation traversing the ring. This model was used to mimic a reentrant wave during arrhythmia. Therefore, it presents great concerns if a large number of cardiac tissues experience arrhythmia by geometry-induced re-entry current and cannot be used as a healthy tissue model. It would be interesting to see the impulse propagation/calcium transient on these miniature cardiac rings and evaluate the % of arrhythmia occurrence.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The size is a key factor impacting the electrical propagation within the generated tissues. Our ring-shaped cardiac tissues have a diameter of 360µm, which is largely smaller than other tissues proposed so far,  including in Thavandiran et al (PNAS 2013) where circular tissues had a reported size &gt; 1mm. As shown in Figure 4E (and highlighted below in Author response image 1), tissues under basal conditions display regular beating rates without spontaneous arrhythmias. Videos also show that the tissue contraction is homogeneous around the pillar, suggesting that the smaller size favors the electrical propagation and limits the occurrence of spontaneous reentrant waves. Optical mapping measurements will be performed in the future to assess the occurrence of reentrant waves.</p>

<p>1. The platform can produce 21 cardiac rings per well in 96-well plates. The throughput has been the highest among competing platforms. The resulting tissues have good sarcomere striation due to the strain from the pillars. Now the emerging questions are culture longevity and reproducibility among tissues. According to Figure 1E, there was uneven ring formation around the pillar, which leads to the tissue thinning and breaking off. There is only 50% survival after 20 days of culture in the optimized seeding group. Is there any way to improve it? The tissues had two compartments, cardiac and fibroblast-rich regions, where fibroblasts are responsible for maintaining the attachment to the glass slides. Do the cardiac rings detach from the glass slides and roll up? The SD of the force measurement is a quarter of the value, which is not ideal with such a high replicate number. As the platform utilizes imaging analysis to derive contractile dynamics, calibration should be done based on the angle and the distance of the camera lens to the individual tissues to reduce the error. On the other hand, how reproducible of the pillars? It is highly recommended to mechanically evaluate the consistency of the hydrogel-based pillars across different wells and within the wells to understand the variance.
Figure 2B reports the early results obtained as the system was tested and developed. Since then, we have tested different iPSC lines and confirm that the overall yield is higher (up to 20 tissues at D14 for some cell lines), however dependent of cell lines.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The tissues do not detach from the glass slides. It is very rare to see tissues roll up on the central pillar. As shown in Figure 1B, the pillars have a specific shape to avoid tissues to roll up as they develop and contract.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. Does the platform allow the observation of non-synchronized beating when testing with compounds? This can be extremely important as the intended applications of this platform are drug testing and cardiac disease modeling. The author should elaborate on the method in the manuscript and explain the obtained results in detail.
The arrhythmogenic effect of a drug can be derived from the regularity of the beat-to-beat time. Indeed, we show that dofetilide increases the variability in the beat-to-beat time by plotting for each beat, the beat-to-beat time with the next beat as a function of the beat-to-beat time with the previous beat.</p>
<p>1. The results of drug testing are interesting. Isoproterenol is typically causing positive chronotropic and positive inotropic responses, where inotropic responses are difficult to obtain due to low tissue maturity. It is inconsistent with other reported results that cardiac rings do not exhibit increased beating frequency, but slightly increased forces only. Zhao et al were using electrical pacing at a defined rate during force measurement, whereas the ring constructs are not.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree. The difference in the response to isoproterenol with previous papers may be explained by different incubation timing with the drug. In our case, the tissues were incubated for 5 minutes at 37•C before being recorded.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Overall, the manuscript is well written and the designed platform presented the unique advantages of high throughput cardiac tissue culture. Besides the contractile dynamics and IHC images, the paper lacks other cardiac functional evaluations, such as calcium handling, impulse propagation, and/or electrophysiology. The culture reproducibility (high SD) and longevity (&lt;20 days) still remain unsolved.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Since the submission, we have managed to keep some tissues and analyze them up to 32 days. At that time point the tissues are still beating. Nevertheless, a specific study concerning tissue longevity has not been carried out as the tissues were usually fixed after 14 days to be stained and analyze their structure.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>Our results indicate that the fibroblasts/cardiomyocytes segregation likely happens as soon as the tissue is formed, as the fibroblasts are critical for tissue generation. The change with time in the shape of the contractile ring is reported in Figure 1E, with a series of images which correspond to the timepoints of Figure 3.</p>
