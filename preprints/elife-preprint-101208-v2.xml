<title>Abstract</title><p>Climate change may introduce conditions beyond species’ tolerances; to survive, species must avoid these extremes. Phenological shifts are one strategy, as species move their activity or life history events in time to avoid extreme conditions. Species may also shift in space, moving their ranges poleward to escape extremes. However, whether species are more likely to exhibit one or both strategies, and whether this can be predicted based on a species’ functional traits, is unknown. Using a powerful macroecological dataset of European and North American odonate observations, we assessed range and phenology shifts between two time periods (1980-2002 and 2008-2018) to measure the strength and direction of the association between responses. Species with the greatest poleward range shifts also showed the largest phenological shifts toward earlier annual activity periods, with half of all species shifting in both space and time. This response was consistent across continents, despite highly divergent land use and biogeographical histories in these regions. Surprisingly, species’ range and phenology shifts were not related to functional traits; rather, southern species shifted their range limits more strongly, while increasing temperature variability hindered range shifts. By reducing risk through phenological shifts, the resulting larger populations may be more likely to disperse and expand species’ ranges. While species shifting in both space and time may be more resilient to extreme conditions, we identified a small number of species (approximately 10%) that failed to shift at all; these species are likely to be particularly vulnerable to climate change, and should be prioritized for conservation intervention.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Climate change alters climatic means and increases the frequency of extreme weather events, exposing species to conditions outside of their tolerances, and often leading to population declines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Goulson, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">IPCC, 2021</xref>). Species may avoid extreme conditions by dispersing to new areas where conditions pose fewer weather-related challenges, often leading to poleward range expansion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Davis et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Lawlor et al., 2024</xref>). Species’ biological timing could also shift, through adaptation or phenotypic plasticity, with earlier warming advancing the timing of early-season activities and life-history events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Davis et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Hällfors et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Novella-Fernandez et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Parmesan and Yohe, 2003</xref>). Both species’ geographical ranges and seasonal timing depend strongly on climate and habitat conditions, with shifts in space and time permitting species to remain within the limits of their ecological niches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Chen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Engelhardt et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Grewe et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Menzel et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Parmesan and Yohe, 2003</xref>). This allows populations to grow, despite changing environments, and reduces the risk of climate debt and extinction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Devictor et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Franks et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Lustenhouwer et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">Saino et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c92">Souza et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c98">Urban, 2015</xref>).</p>
<p>Positive population trends can be stronger in species that shift both their range and phenology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Hällfors et al., 2024</xref>). Greater phenological plasticity under warmer spring temperatures may increase reproductive success, leading to greater population growth and range expansions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Macgregor et al., 2019</xref>), as positive or stable trends in species abundance and habitat availability are essential for range shifts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Mair et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Platts et al., 2019</xref>). However, there could also be a trade-off between phenological and geographical shifts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Amano et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Hassall, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">Socolar et al., 2017</xref>). Species with greater dispersal abilities may have less need for phenological shifts as they track their climatic niche through space, while weaker dispersers may be confronted with greater selective pressure to shift phenology within their range (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Amano et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Hassall, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">Socolar et al., 2017</xref>). Since range shifts can also result from extirpations at species’ trailing range edge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Parmesan et al., 1999</xref>), greater phenological shifts may mitigate the need for range shifts, as species better tolerate new climatic conditions. Cross continental studies report converging effects of climate change on species’ range shifts and abundances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Neate-Clegg et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c94">Stephens et al., 2016</xref>), including among insects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Kerr et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Neate-Clegg et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Pinkert et al., 2022</xref>), but potential relationships between phenological and geographic responses have not yet been investigated at continental scales. Functional traits, such as dispersal, may determine species’ spatial and temporal responses to climate change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Chen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Kharouba et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">Schuetz et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c104">Zografou et al., 2021</xref>). However, these relationships are inconsistent across taxa and regions, and cross-continental tests have not been attempted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Angert et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Buckley and Kingsolver, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Estrada et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">MacLean and Beissinger, 2017</xref>). Geographic locations and environmental characteristics of species’ ranges may also predict range shifts, as animal species with high latitude ranges have been shown to exhibit smaller range shifts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">MacLean and Beissinger, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Pinkert et al., 2022</xref>), while increasing local temperature and loss of natural landcover may drive range retractions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Pacifici et al., 2020</xref>). However, exposure to extreme climate events (e.g. drought, heat waves, or storms) within species ranges may disrupt species’ dispersal abilities and capacities to tolerate new conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Kerr, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">Román-Palacios and Wiens, 2020</xref>). Exposure to thermal anomalies can rapidly change entire communities and create shifts towards new ecosystems, sometimes leading to local declines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Day et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Grant et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Harris et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">Román-Palacios and Wiens, 2020</xref>).</p>
<p>While global change research on insects often emphasizes butterfly and bee taxa, recently assembled databases of odonate observations provide a rare opportunity to investigate species’ spatiotemporal responses at larger taxonomic and spatial scales, particularly as most work has been done at national scales (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Córdoba-Aguilar et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Kalkman et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">Sandall et al., 2022</xref>). Due to their use of aquatic and terrestrial habitat across life different stages, dragonflies and damselflies are also considered indicator species for both terrestrial and aquatic insect responses to changing climates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Hassall, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Pinkert et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">Šigutová et al., 2025</xref>), giving the study of these species broad relevance for conservation. There is some evidence that functional traits relate to odonates’ interspecific variation in range shifts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Angert et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Grewe et al., 2013</xref>), phenology shifts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Diamond et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Gutiérrez and Wilson, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c104">Zografou et al., 2021</xref>), extinction risks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Cardillo et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Cooper et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Rocha-Ortega et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c95">Suhonen et al., 2022</xref>), and rates of decline and expansion within limited geographic scopes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Powney et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Rapacciuolo et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Rocha-Ortega et al., 2020</xref>). While relationships between morphological traits and range boundaries have been shown for some groups (i.e. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">Rundle et al., 2007</xref>), these may depend on species’ geographic context. For example, differences in habitat connectivity and dispersal ability may constrain range shifts for lentic species (those species that breed in slow moving water like lakes or ponds) and lotic species (those living in fast moving-water) in different ways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Kalkman et al., 2018</xref>). More southerly lentic species may expand their range boundaries more than lotic species, as species accustomed to ephemeral lentic habitats better dispersers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Grewe et al., 2013</xref>), yet lotic species have also been found to expand their ranges more often than lentic species, potentially due to the loss of lentic habitat in some areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Bowler et al., 2021</xref>). While warm-adapted species with more equatorial distributions could expand their ranges poleward following warming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Devictor et al., 2008</xref>), they could also increase in abundance in this new range area relative to species that historically occupied those areas and are less heat-tolerant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Powney et al., 2015</xref>).</p>
<p>In this study, we tested whether species with stronger geographical range shifts also advanced their emergence phenologies, or if one response offsets the need for the other. We also asked whether functional traits, range geography (i.e. southerly vs. northerly), or temperature variability predict range shifts at species’ northern range limits, and whether these factors can also predict shifts in species emergence phenology. We predicted that species would exhibit shifts in both geography and phenology, as we expect species shifting in phenology to have larger populations, increasing likelihood of dispersal and successful range shifts. We predicted that species able to use both lentic and lotic habitats would shift their phenologies and geographies more than those able to use just one habitat type, as generalists outperform specialists as climate and land uses change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Ball-Damerow et al., 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Hassall and Thompson, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Powney et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Rapacciuolo et al., 2017</xref>). Alternatively, species might respond to rapid climate changes in ways that reflect their geographical position, indicating that where they are found is a better predictor of their conservation risk from global change than their intrinsic biological characteristics.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="s2a">
<title>Biological records</title>
<p>We assembled ∼2 million observations records for North American and European odonate species collected between 1980 and 2018. Data sources included online dataset aggregators GBIF (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://gbif.org/">http://gbif.org/</ext-link>) and Canadensys (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.canadensys.net/">http://www.canadensys.net/</ext-link>), Odonata Central (Abbott, 2020), and other institutions (see Acknowledgments). While odonates were sampled opportunistically, biases associated with data that are not systematically collected are less likely to affect trends at large spatial and temporal scales, particularly if data are obtained from multiple independent sources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Pyke and Ehrlich, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c103">Zattara and Aizen, 2021</xref>). We removed records with incomplete or missing species identification, year, or locality information. We selected unique observations for species, location, year, and Julian day of collection, and restricted the data to continental North America and Europe. We mapped species-specific observations using ArcGIS software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">ESRI, 2019</xref>), and qualitatively verified species ranges. If a species was found on both continents, we only retained observations from the continent that was the most densely sampled. If we merged data for one species found on both continents, we could not perform a cross-continental comparison. However, if the same species on different continents was treated as different species, this would lead to uninterpretable outcomes (and the creation of pseudo-replication) in the context of phylogenetic analyses. In addition, species found on both continents did not have sufficient data to meet criteria for the phenology analysis.</p>
<p>We followed widely accepted methods to determine species range boundaries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Devictor et al., 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Kerr et al., 2015</xref>), although other methods exist that are appropriate for different data types and research questions i.e. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Ni and Vellend, 2021</xref>). We assigned species presences to 100×100 km quadrats, a scale that is large enough to maintain adequate sampling intensity but still relevant to conservation and policy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">Soroye et al., 2020</xref>), to identify the best sampled species. We excluded species found in fewer than 50 quadrats to increase the likelihood of accurately predicting the position of species’ northern range boundaries. We retained ∼1,100,000 records from Canada, the United States, and Northern Mexico, comprising 76 species (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). Observation records were separated into two time periods, to compare species’ recent phenologies and northern range limits (2008 to 2018) to conditions in a historical time period (1980 to 2002).</p>

<title>Temperature Variability</title>
<p>Temperature variability during a species’ flight season may impact its ability to establish in new locations, or shift its emergence timing the following year. We downloaded a high-resolution gridded dataset for monthly average daily maximum temperature from the Climatic Research Unit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">New et al., 2002</xref>). We extracted average values per 100×100 km quadrat across the months of April to October, covering the main flight period for odonates in this study, for each year included in the historical and recent periods. We calculated the coefficient of variation per quadrat for each time period and averaged these values per species and time period to measure interannual temperature variability during species’ flight season across their range. We used the difference between recent and historical measures as an estimate of change in temperature variability.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2c">
<title>Spatial and temporal change metrics</title>
<p>To limit potential effects of temporal and spatial biases, we generated range and phenology shift metrics with specific criteria for quadrats and species selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bartomeus et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Gaiji et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">García-Roselló et al., 2015</xref>); we retained 76 species for range shift estimates (Supplementary Information). Species’ northern range boundaries were calculated using the mean of the 10 most northern points of each species range in both the historic (1980 – 2002) and recent (2008 – 2018) time periods, measured in kilometers from the equator (as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Kerr et al., 2015</xref>). We used the difference between range limit positions in the historic recent time periods to estimate species’ northern range limit shifts.</p>
<p>Since spatiotemporal biases sometimes inflate range shift measurements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Kujala et al., 2013</xref>), we used null models to test whether observed range shift estimates were robust, and the extent to which those responses differed from expectations arising because of rising sampling intensity over time. 1000 randomized datasets were created with the same number of species-specific geographical points per time period as the number of actual observations. Maximum and minimum latitude and longitude values were held constant relative to observed values. Northern range limit shifts were calculated as the difference in the mean of the 10 most northern points between the historic and recent time periods. We used generalized linear models (GLMs; glm command in R) to test whether species-specific range limit shifts in each iteration predicted range shifts measured from the observation data (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1</xref>, <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">S2</xref>). We found that observed northern range limit shifts are not consistent with expectations derived from changes in sampling intensity.</p>
<p>We estimated species-specific emergence phenology for each time period in 200×200 km quadrats; using larger quadrats increases probabilities of detecting signals of emergence phenology, which may otherwise be lost due to gaps in data density. We retained quadrats that contained at least 25 observations for a given species in both time periods. To estimate phenology per area, we used the <italic>weib.limit</italic> function of the <italic>WeibullR</italic> R package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Pearse et al., 2017</xref>). This function uses the Weibull distribution to estimate the Julian day of a species’ first appearance, and is especially useful to measure the timing of phenological events in sparsely sampled datasets. Techniques such as using the average of the n<sup>th</sup> first observations of phenological events, or the n<sup>th</sup> percentile flight dates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Brooks et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Robbirt et al., 2011</xref>), tend to overestimate the timing of biological events due to temporal bias towards later days in the species’ active period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Pearse et al., 2017</xref>). We retained emergence estimates between March 1<sup>st</sup> and September 1<sup>st</sup>, as well as species and quadrats that showed a difference in emergence phenology of −25 to 25 days, −30 to 30 days, or −35 to 35 days between both time periods, to include only phenology shifts that could be biologically meaningful to environmental climate change. 68 species found across 63 quadrats met these criteria. Large changes in phenology are likely explained by other anthropogenic or natural factors, or could occur due to noise in the data, since these phenology calculations per region are extremely data intensive. We calculated the difference in the day of emergence per quadrat between both time periods, as well as mean phenology change across all quadrats for each species. The number of quadrats per species used to calculate their mean phenological shift varied between 2 and 46.</p>
<p>We used null models to assess whether our approach to estimating phenology shifts was robust, as potential issues may arise due to spatiotemporal biases in the underlying data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Kujala et al., 2013</xref>). We constructed 1000 randomized datasets of species’ hypothetical days of occurrence, using the same number of quadrats, and observations within quadrats, as in each time period of the observation records. We assigned the maximum and minimum Julian day of occurrence from the observation records to limit values in the randomized datasets. We applied the same method and criteria of inclusion to the randomized datasets as we did to measure phenology shifts from the observation data. GLMs were built to test whether phenology shifts calculated using 1000 random datasets predicted the phenology shifts that we measured. No discernable pattern emerged, indicating that observed shifts in phenology are not consistent with expectations derived from differences in sampling intensity over time (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figure S3</xref>, <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">S4</xref>).</p>

<title>Range geographies and functional traits</title>
<p>To assemble trait data for the 76 species in the database, we used field guides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Cannings, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Jones et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Paulson, 2012</xref>) and existing trait databases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Powney et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c102">Waller et al., 2019</xref>). We considered any evolved morphological, physiological, behavioural, or life history characteristic as a functional trait (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Beissinger and Riddell, 2021</xref>). Geographic range and associated climatic characteristics are often considered ecological traits, as they are consequences of functional traits and their interactions with geographic features (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Bried and Rocha-Ortega, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Chichorro et al., 2019</xref>). Such ecological variables may predict species’ responses to climate change, and can add significant value to predictive models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">MacLean and Beissinger, 2017</xref>). We identified whether species’ ranges were more northern, southern, or both northern and southern (both), and determined the range size of each species by counting the number of quadrats occupied by that species in the historical time period.</p>
<p>Along with the geographic and climatic attributes, temperature variability and distribution, we selected four functional traits likely to be biologically relevant to spatial and temporal responses to climate change: flight duration, breeding habitat type (lotic, lentic, or both), egg laying habitat (exophytic vs. endophytic), and body size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Cannings, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Jones et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Paulson 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Powney et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c102">Waller et al., 2019</xref>). Species’ flight period was measured as the total number of days of the flight period, estimated from the approximate time of the month of average first and last appearances. Breeding habitat was assigned according to a species’ uses of lotic, lentic, or both habitat types. Egg laying habitat was assigned according to whether species use exophytic egg-laying habitat (i.e. eggs laid in water or on land, relatively larger in number), or endophytic egg-laying habitat (i.e. eggs laid inside plants, usually fewer in number); species using exophytic habitats are associated with greater northward range limit shifts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Angert et al., 2011</xref>). Body size corresponded to the mean length of the abdomen of each species. We excluded overwintering stage and range size from our analysis as data were incomplete for many species, and excluded migratory behavior as the vast majority of species included in the study were non-migratory.</p>
<p>We tested for correlations amongst all predictors by calculating the Predictive Power Statistic (PPS) and Pearson correlations among traits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c100">van der Laken, 2021</xref>): we found no evidence of correlation.</p>

<title>Statistical analyses</title>
<p>We conducted statistical analyses using R Statistical Software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">R Core Team, 2019</xref>). All continuous variables were transformed into Z-scores using the <italic>scale</italic> function in R. First, we investigated whether there was a relationship between species’ range and phenological shifts by modelling phenology shift as the dependent variable, and range shift and continent as independent variables. We used both species-level frequentist (GLM; glm function in R) and Bayesian (Markov Chain Monte Carlo generalized linear mixed model, MCMCglmm; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Hadfield, 2010</xref>) models to improve the robustness of the results. We included a term to account for phylogeny in the MCMCglmm model, as species that are closely related are likely to have similar traits. We used the molecular phylogenetic tree published by the Odonate Phenotypic Database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c102">Waller et al., 2019</xref>), which used a morphological and taxonomic phylogeny as the backbone tree, allowing species to move within their named genera or families according to molecular evidence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c101">Waller and Svensson, 2017</xref>). Trace and density plots for the MCMCglmm model revealed no issues with autocorrelation or model convergence (<xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Figure S7</xref>).</p>
<p>Next, we investigated whether functional traits, range geography, or temperature variability predicted range shifts at species’ northern range limits, and whether the same predictors explaining range expansions could also predict shifts in species emergence phenology. We constructed two sets of GLMs, in addition to two sets of MCMCglmms accounting for phylogeny; one of each with changes in species’ northern range limits as the response variable, and the other with changes in emergence phenology as the response variable. Non-significant variables, specifically all functional traits, were removed from the final geographic range shift model. No effects were significant in the model of phenology shifts. Trace and density plots for the MCMCglmm models did not indicate limitations related to autocorrelation or model convergence (<xref rid="figs8" ref-type="fig">Figure S8</xref>).</p>
<p>In addition to the inclusion of phylogeny in statistical models to account for potential data non-independence, we measured the phylogenetic signal in range and phenological shifts. We used the <italic>phylosig</italic> function of the <italic>Phytools</italic> package version 0.7-70 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Revell, 2012</xref>), which calculates phylogenetic signal using Pagel’s lambda and Blomberg’s K.</p>

<title>Relationship between range and phenology shifts</title>
<p>Most species (52 of 76) expanded their northern range limits toward higher latitudes (mean range expansions of 180 km). The average range expansion across all species was 63 km northward, although some species showed range retractions (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>). Most species (41 of 66) maintained or advanced their emergence phenology (mean of −2.71 days in emergence phenology shifts among all species; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>). Fewer species were included in phenology analyses than analyses of range shifts due to the data intensity required to capture phenology shifts at a study site (N=66 vs. N = 76). Many species (50%) showed both advancing emergence phenology and range expansions, while 10% of species showed neither range nor phenological shifts relative to historical baselines.</p>
<p>The effect of species’ range shifts on phenology range shifts was significant in our model investigating the relationship between these responses, indicating that species shifting their northern range limits to higher latitudes also showed stronger advances in their emergence phenology (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). This result that was consistent in GLM and Bayesian analyses (p &lt; 0.01; <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), and was maintained across North America and Europe, with no effect of continent in the model. This trend was consistent among both dragonflies and damselflies, although there was considerable interspecific variation in the magnitude of spatial and temporal shifts. Accounting for phylogeny did not improve model predictions and did not explain greater model variance (R<sup>2</sup> = 17% and 15%, for GLM and MCMCglmm models, respectively).</p>

<title>Drivers of range and phenology shifts</title>
<p>Range geography and climate variability, rather than functional traits, predicted range shifts in both North America and Europe, with range geography being consistently the strongest predictor. Species’ functional traits did not relate to the extent of observed geographical range shifts in tests using GLM and MCMCglmm models. Species with more southern distributions shifted their northern range limits towards higher latitudes more than northern species or species present in both the north and south (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>; p = 0.002 and 0.004, model R<sup>2</sup> = 26.6% and 23.7%, for GLM and MCMCglmm models, respectively), with no effect of range size on range shifts. Species experiencing smaller changes in interannual temperature variability also had a higher likelihood of northern range limit shifts (p = 0.0005 for GLM, p = 0.002 for MCMCglmm). Results from the GLM and MCMCglmm models were qualitatively similar, however, a smaller amount of model variance was explained when phylogeny was accounted for. Emergence phenology shifts were not affected by species’ traits, range geography, nor climate variability; due to this, model results are not displayed here. While range and phenology response types are related, this suggests that the mechanisms underlying phenological shifts are different than those underlying range shifts.</p>

<p>A phylogenetic signal may indicate that there are traits that determine species’ spatial and temporal responses to changing climate that were not measured in this study. Yet we detected no phylogenetic signal using Pagel’s lambda or Blomberg’s K in either geographical range or phenological responses (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Adding a phylogeny term to the MCMCglmm models also failed to produce a pattern different to the GLMs, and model performance did not improve when we accounted for phylogeny in our assessment of northern range shifts.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In one of the first studies to investigate both shifts of phenology and range at a continental scale, we find that dragonfly and damselfly species show pronounced geographical and phenological shifts that converged across Europe and North America. Species expanding their ranges poleward also emerged earlier in the spring on both continents (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>), with shifts predicted by range geography and climate variability, but not functional traits. These results suggest that some species are ‘universal winners’ with respect to climate change: they demonstrate the flexibility to respond both temporally and spatially to the onset of rapid climate change. Conversely, species that show neither geographic nor phenological shifts may be particularly vulnerable to climate change.</p>
<p>We found no evidence for a tradeoff between range and phenology shifts; instead, half of species shifted both range and phenology. Earlier seasonal timing allows species to stay within their climatic limits. This may lead to higher local population growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Macgregor et al., 2019</xref>), although earlier emergence could expose individuals to early season weather extremes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">McCauley et al., 2018</xref>). As only a small proportion of odonate adults undertake long range dispersal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Conrad et al., 1999</xref>), greater local population sizes should contribute to higher dispersal rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Mair et al., 2014</xref>), facilitating range shifts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Kerr, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Leroux et al., 2013</xref>). This is consistent with results from other taxa: among British butterflies, early emergence increased population growth and facilitated range shifts for species with multiple generations per year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Macgregor et al., 2019</xref>); Finnish butterfly species with the greatest population growth rates shifted both their phenology and ranges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Hällfors et al., 2021</xref>). Such population growth or maintenance, and therefore the potential for range shifts, is only possible if habitat is available (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Mair et al., 2014</xref>). Future work should consider habitat availability alongside range and phenology shifts, as it may help explain why some species are able to shift their phenology but not their range.</p>
<p>Southern species were more likely to expand their ranges northward than northern species or species present in both the north and south. Species’ ability to maintain large populations may be impaired in northern latitudes, where rates of climate change are high (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">IPCC, 2021</xref>), hindering dispersal and colonization that are precursors to range expansions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Mair et al., 2014</xref>). Further mechanistic understanding of these processes requires abundance data. Southern species may have narrower niche breadths than widespread or northern species, and may respond more rapidly to climate change to track this narrower niche (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Hällfors et al., 2024</xref>). Emerging mean conditions in areas adjacent to the ranges of southern species may offer opportunities for range expansions of these relative climate specialists, which can then tolerate climate warming in areas of range expansion better than more cool-adapted historical occupants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Day et al., 2018</xref>). Adaptive evolution and plasticity may enable higher population growth rates in newly-colonized areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Angert et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c99">Usui et al., 2023</xref>), but this possibility can only be directly tested with long term population trend data. While some species experienced range retractions, these may result from sampling variability or stochastic population fluctuations along the northern range edge.</p>
<p>Increasing frequency and severity of extreme weather limited species’ geographical range responses (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). This trend was independent of functional traits that are mechanistically linked to species’ climate change responses, such as dispersal ability or habitat preference. Extreme temperatures can reduce population sizes, leading to local extinctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">Román-Palacios and Wiens, 2020</xref>), and reducing the likelihood of range expansions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Mair et al., 2014</xref>). In odonates, experimental evidence has demonstrated that larval mortality rises with short-term extreme weather (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">McCauley et al., 2015</xref>). Individuals that shift phenologies earlier in the season to avoid climate extremes could still be exposed to harmful conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Iler et al., 2021</xref>); for example, odonate populations that respond to unusually warm spring temperatures may experience high mortality if temperatures return to seasonal conditions. Species that experience extreme conditions may then be unable to successfully shift in time, reducing population sizes, and reducing the likelihood of range shifts.</p>
<p>In contrast to previous work demonstrating that range and phenology shifts are at least partially determined by species traits (i.e. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c96">Sunday et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c104">Zografou et al., 2021</xref>), no functional trait, or combination of traits, explained these shifts in North American and European Odonata. While we could not capture all functional traits in this analysis, our results are consistent with other work that identifies climate velocity and sensitivity as the best predictors of range shifts and thermal preferences tracking in marine systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Pinsky et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">Schuetz et al., 2019</xref>). Species’ tolerances to increasingly variable temperatures also helps to predict extinction risk during climate change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Kerr, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Rocha-Ortega et al., 2020</xref>). The extent to which species’ traits actually determine rates of range and phenological shifts, rather than occasionally correlated with them, is worth considering further, but functional traits do not systematically drive patterns in these shifts among Odonates in North America and Europe.</p>
<p>The geographic positions of species’ ranges determine the local pressures and environmental factors to which they are exposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">MacLean and Beissinger, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Pacifici et al., 2020</xref>), potentially masking the effects of traits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">Schuetz et al., 2019</xref>). This process could cause trait-related trends to differ across levels of biological organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93">Srivastava et al., 2021</xref>), from local populations (where traits might be critical) to biogeographical extents (where traits might be unrelated to range or phenological shifts; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Grewe et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Gutiérrez and Wilson, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c96">Sunday et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c104">Zografou et al., 2021</xref>).</p>
<p>Given that species’ functional traits did not predict temporal or geographic responses, it is unsurprising that species’ responses were also independent of phylogenetic history (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Franke et al., 2022</xref>). The phylogenetic approach did not improve model predictions in any model that we tested, and there was no phylogenetic signal in either response according to Pagel’s lambda and Blomberg’s K (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). These results are consistent with previous work that found no phylogenetic trend in local odonate population extinctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c95">Suhonen et al., 2022</xref>). There may be strong variation in thermal niches among closely related species: species that are geographically isolated adapt to different local climates, while species that co-occur may experience divergent selection within their climate tolerances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">Schuetz et al., 2019</xref>).</p>
<p>It remains unclear if range and phenology shifts relate to trends in abundance, but our results suggest that there are clear ‘winners’ and ‘losers’ under climate change (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>). Climate ‘winners’, species that are shifting in space and time, may require more limited conservation intervention. Species expanding their ranges could be better supported if habitat area and connectivity are conserved, facilitating climate-driven range shifts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Littlefield et al., 2019</xref>). Species only shifting their phenologies may require further study, as phenology shifts may have positive or negative impacts on abundance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Iler et al., 2021</xref>). Climate ‘losers’, species that are failing to shift in both space and time, may require more direct conservation intervention, such as managed relocation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Richardson et al., 2009</xref>). Species that did not shift their ranges northwards or advance their phenology included <italic>Coenagrion mercuriale</italic>, a European species that is listed as near threatened by the IUCN Red List (IUCN, 2021), and is projected to lose 68% of its range by 2035 (Jaeschke et al., 2013). This group also includes <italic>Coenagrion resolutum,</italic> a common North American damselfly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c97">Swaegers et al., 2014</xref>), for which we could not find evidence of decline. This may be due in part to the greater area of intact habitat available in North American compared to Europe, enabling <italic>C. resolutum</italic> to maintain larger populations that are less vulnerable to stochastic climate events. Still, this and other species failing to shift in range or phenology should be assessed for population health, as this species could be carrying an unobserved extinction debt. Our analysis of phenology and range shifts should be repeated in other taxa, as it may offer a method of identifying conservation actions among species groups.</p>

<p>Understanding how range and phenology shifts vary across species, and what drives this variation, is increasingly urgent as climate change alters local and regional environmental conditions. Here, we showed that odonate species exhibit convergent responses of range and phenology shifts across continents. While species with southern distributions were more likely to shift their ranges, increasing temperature variation limited geographical range responses among species in both Europe and North America. Climate change is associated with increasing variability as well as shifting mean conditions, contributing to species decline and even local extinction risks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Duffy et al., 2022</xref>). In this study, where species are found (i.e. their range geographies) determines whether they are exposed and respond to such negative pressures. Simultaneous consideration of shifts in range and phenology is a powerful and necessary approach to test aspects of species’ vulnerabilities to rapid global changes. By considering both the seasonal and range dynamics of species, emergent and convergent climate change responses across continents become clear for this well-studied group of predatory insects.</p>

<title>Phenology and range position estimates</title>
<p>We have not tried to interpret noise in phenology shift estimates, which could occur due to sampling issues, or to another biologically meaningful eco-evolutionary response. Our methods do not enable tests of those ideas, however. For example, <italic>Aeshna umbrosa</italic> has a surprisingly high phenology shift (&gt;25 days) but a very strong range retraction (&lt;-300 km). For this species, we retained 8 quadrats to calculate mean phenology shift estimate. It is possible that a section of the range was lost in which emergence was especially early, compared to other regions, due to local adaptations. This pattern may affect results where species appear to shift emergence dates earlier/later, but phenology shifts are affected by parts of the range that remain occupied.</p>
<p>We put in place criteria to make sure to include species with range shifts likely to result from climate change effects, rather than from sampling issues or to other anthropogenic pressures such as land use change, or sudden land use intensification. <italic>Nehalennia irene</italic> was thus removed, as its range positions were highly unusual, and likely due to other factors than global change (&gt;800 km). <italic>Libellula quadrimaculata</italic> was removed due to sampling intensity discrepancies between time periods, having over 10,000 extra points in the second period compared to the first.</p>
<p>Temporal and spatial bias are likely to be present in opportunistic data, but they are less likely to impact long term factors of species’ distributions if including data from as many sources as possible, and that span across large geographic and temporal scopes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Pyke and Ehrlich, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c103">Zattara and Aizen, 2021</xref>).

Further, among preliminary examinations of the data, we test for the effect of sampling onto our phenology and range shift estimates. We found no effect of sampling on range of phenology responses that we calculated here. We tested a linear mixed model with species as a random effect that assesses whether sampling intensity change per quadrat (where sampling intensity corresponds to sampling per species/quadrat) predicts species’ phenology change per quadrat. The p-value of the predictor variable, sampling intensity change, was not significant. Secondly, we built a Generalized Linear Model to assess whether greater sampling overall (measured as the number of quadrats in which each species is sampled) predicts species’ range shifts that we computed. The p-value of the predictor variable, sampling change per species, was not significant. If spatial bias was present here, we may expect the number of quadrats in which species are found to increase the position of species’ northern range boundaries.</p>

<title>Model information and statements</title>
<p>We report the full model statements below as executed with the <italic>MCMCglmm</italic> R package, including the priors, and the model of trait evolution to account for phylogeny. Prior structure followed standard practice according to continuous or binary response variable. The family “gaussian” or “threshold” was selected depending on the continuous or binary nature of the data, respectively. The number of iterations, burnin, and thinning parameters were tested and confirmed with a visual assessment of model convergence using the trace and density plots. It is common practice for the burnin parameter to correspond to 10% of the number of iterations.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This study evaluates whether species can shift geographically, temporally, or both ways in response to climate change. It also teases out the relative importance of geographic context, temperature variability, and functional traits in predicting the shifts. The study system is large occurrence datasets for dragonflies and damselflies split between two time periods and two continents. Results indicate that more species exhibited both shifts than one or the other (or neither), and that geographic context and temperature variability were more influential than traits. The results have implications for future analyses (e.g. incorporating habitat availability) and for choosing winner and loser species under climate change. The results also seem to support climate vulnerability assessments for species that rely on geographic range size and geospatial climate data layers rather than more detailed information (like demographic rates, abundances, or traits) that may not be so readily available. The methodology would be useful for other taxa and study regions with strong participatory (&quot;citizen&quot;) science and extensive occurrence data.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This is an organized and well written paper that builds on a popular topic and moves it forward. It has the right idea and approach, and the results are useful answers to the predictions and for conservation planning (i.e. identifying climate winners and losers). There is technical proficiency and analytical rigor driven by an understanding of the data and its limitations.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This paper explores a highly interesting question regarding how species migration success relates to phenology shifts, and it finds a positive relationship. The findings are significant, and the strength of the evidence is solid. However, there are substantial issues with the writing, presentation, and analyses that need to be addressed. First, I disagree with the conclusion that species that don't migrate are &quot;losers&quot; - some species might not migrate simply because they have broad climatic niches and are less sensitive to climate change. Second, the results concerning species' southern range limits could provide valuable insights. These could be used to assess whether sampling bias has influenced the results. If species are truly migrating, we should observe northward shifts in their southern range limits. However, if this is an artifact of increased sampling over time, we would expect broader distributions both north and south. Finally, Figure 1 is missed panel B, which needs to be addressed.</p>
<p>Comments on revised version:</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In their article &quot;Range geography and temperature variability explain cross-continental convergence in range and phenology shifts in a model insect taxon&quot; the authors rigorously investigate the spatial and temporal trends in the occurrence of odonate species and their potential drivers. Specifically, they examine whether species shift their geographic ranges poleward or alter their phenology to cope with changing conditions. Leveraging opportunistic observations of European and North American odonates, they find that species showing significant range shifts also exhibited shifts to earlier emergence. Considering a broad range of potential predictors, their results reveal that geographical factors, but not functional traits, are associated with these shifts.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The article addresses an important topic in ecology and conservation that is particularly timely in the face of reports of substantial insects declines in North America and Europe over the past decades. Through data integration the authors leverage the rich natural history record for odonates, broadening the taxonomic scope of analyses of temporal trends in phenology and distribution. The combination of phenological and range shifts in one framework presents an elegant way to reconcile previous findings and informs about the drivers of biodiversity loss.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>To better understand whether species shifting both their ranges and phenology are more successful, or as stated here are 'clear winners', and hence whether those that do neither are more vulnerable would require integrating population trends alongside the discussed response. The ~10% species that have not shifted their distribution or phenology might have not declined in abundance, if they have rapidly adapted to local changes in climatic conditions (i.e. they might show a plastic response). These species might be the real 'winners', while species that have recently shifted their ranges or phenology may eventually reach hard limits. The authors are discussing this limitation but might want to adapt their wording, given the potential for misinterpretation. The finding that species with more northern ranges showed lesser northward shifts would speak to the fact that some species have already reached such a geographical range limit.</p>
<p>Achievements and impact:</p>
<p>The results support broad differences in the response of odonate species to climate change, and the prediction that range geography and temperature seasonality are more important predictors of these changes than functional traits. Simultaneously addressing range and phenological shifts highlights that most species exhibit coupled responses but also identifies a significant portion of species that do not respond in these ways that are of critical conservation concern. These results are important for improving forecasts of species' responses to climate change and identifying species of particularly conservation concern. Although not exhaustive regarding abundance trends, the study presents an important step towards a general framework for investigating the drivers of multifaceted species responses.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>Sumary:</p>
<p>This study evaluates whether species can shift geographically, temporally, or both ways in response to climate change. It also teases out the relative importance of geographic context, temperature variability, and functional traits in predicting the shifts. The study system is large occurrence datasets for dragonflies and damselflies split between two time periods and two continents. Results indicate that more species exhibited both shifts than one or the other or neither, and that geographic context and temp variability were more influential than traits. The results have implications for future analyses (e.g. incorporating habitat availability) and for choosing winner and loser species under climate change. The methodology would be useful for other taxa and study regions with strong community/citizen science and extensive occurrence data.</p>

<p>We thank Reviewer 1 for their time and expertise in reviewing our study. The suggestions are very helpful and will improve the quality of our manuscript.</p>

<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This is an organized and well-written paper that builds on a popular topic and moves it forward. It has the right idea and approach, and the results are useful answers to the predictions and for conservation planning (i.e. identifying climate winners and losers). There is technical proficiency and analytical rigor driven by an understanding of the data and its limitations.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank Reviewer 1 for this assessment.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) The habitat classifications (Table S3) are often wrong. &quot;Both&quot; is overused. In North America, for example, Anax junius, Cordulia shurtleffii, Epitheca cynosura, Erythemis simplicicollis, Libellula pulchella, Pachydiplax longipennis, Pantala flavescens, Perithemis tenera, Ischnura posita, the Lestes species, and several Enallagma species are not lotic breeding. These species rarely occur let alone successfully reproduce at lotic sites. Other species are arguably &quot;both&quot;, like Rhionaeschna multicolor which is mostly lentic. Not saying this would have altered the conclusions, but it may have exacerbated the weak trait effects.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for their expertise on this topic. We obtained these habitat classifications from field guides and trait databases, and reviewed our primary sources to clarify the trait classifications. We reclassified the species according to the expertise of this reviewer and perform our analysis again; please see details below.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) The conservative spatial resolution (100 x 100 km) limits the analysis to wide- ranging and generalist species. There's no rationale given, so not sure if this was by design or necessity, but it limits the number of analyzable species and potentially changes the inference.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>It is really helpful to have the opportunity to contextualize study design decisions like this one, and we thank the reviewer for the query. Sampling intensity is always a meaningful issue in research conducted at this scale, and we addressed it head-on in this work.</p>
<p>Very small quadrats covering massive geographical areas will be critically and increasingly afflicted by sampling weaknesses, as well as creating a potentially large problem with pseudoreplication. There is no simple solution to this problem. It would be possible to create interpolated predictions of species’ distributions using Species Distribution Models, Joint Species Distribution Models, or various kinds of Occupancy Models. None of these approaches then leads to analyses that rely on directly observed patterns. Instead, they are extrapolations, and those extrapolations typically fail when tested, although they have still been tested (for example, papers by Lee-Yaw demonstrate that it is rare for SDMs to predict things well; occupancy models often perform less well than SDMs and do not capture how things change over time - Briscoe et al. 2021, Global Change Biology). The result of employing such techniques would certainly be to make all conclusions speculative, rather than directly observable.</p>
<p>Rather than employing extrapolative models, we relied on transparent techniques that are used successfully in the core macroecology literature that address spatial variation in sampling explicitly and simply. Moreover, we constructed extensive null models that show that range and phenology changes, respectively, are contrary to expectations that arise from sampling difference. 100km quadrats make for a reasonable “middle-ground” in terms of the effects of sampling, and we added a reference to the methods section to clarify this (see details below).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) The objective includes a prediction about generalists vs specialists (L99-103) yet there is no further mention of this dichotomy in the abstract, methods, results, or discussion.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for pointing this out - it is an editing error that should have been resolved prior to submission. We replaced the terms specialist and generalist with specific predictions based on traits (see details below).</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This paper explores a highly interesting question regarding how species migration success relates to phenology shifts, and it finds a positive relationship. The findings are significant, and the strength of the evidence is solid. However, there are substantial issues with the writing, presentation, and analyses that need to be addressed. First, I disagree with the conclusion that species that don't migrate are &quot;losers&quot; - some species might not migrate simply because they have broad climatic niches and are less sensitive to climate change. Second, the results concerning species' southern range limits could provide valuable insights. These could be used to assess whether sampling bias has influenced the results. If species are truly migrating, we should observe northward shifts in their southern range limits. However, if this is an artifact of increased sampling over time, we would expect broader distributions both north and south. Finally, Figure 1 is missed panel B, which needs to be addressed.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank Reviewer 2 for their time and expertise in reviewing our study.</p>
<p>It is possible that some species with broad niches may not need to migrate, although in general failing to move with climate change is considered an indicator of “climate debt”, signaling that a species may be of concern for conservation (ex. Duchenne et al. 2021, Ecology Letters). We revised the discussion to acknowledge potential differences in outcomes (please see details below).</p>
<p>We used null models to test whether our results regarding range shifts were robust, and if they varied due to increased sampling over time. We found that observed northern range limit shifts are not consistent with expectations derived from changes in sampling intensity (Figure S1, S2).</p>
<p>We thank Reviewer 2 for pointing out this error in Figure 1. This conceptual figure was a challenge to construct, as it must illustrate how phenology and range shifts can occur simultaneously or uniquely to enable a hypothetic odonate to track its thermal niche over time. In a previous version of the figure, we had a second panel and we failed to remove the reference to that panel when we simplified the figure. We have updated the figure and figure caption (please see details below).</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In their article &quot;Range geographies, not functional traits, explain convergent range and phenology shifts under climate change,&quot; the authors rigorously investigate the temporal shifts in odonate species and their potential predictors. Specifically, they examine whether species shift their geographic ranges poleward or alter their phenology to avoid extreme conditions. Leveraging opportunistic observations of European and North American odonates, they find that species showing significant range shifts also exhibited earlier phenological shifts. Considering a broad range of potential predictors, their results reveal that geographical factors, but not functional traits, are associated with these shifts.</p>

<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The introduction and discussion of the article would benefit from a stronger contextualization of recent studies on biological responses to climate change and the underpinning mechanism.</p>
<p>The presentation of the results (particularly in figures) should be improved to address the integrative character of the work and help readers extract the main results. While the writing of the article is generally good, particularly the captions and results contain many inconsistencies and lack important detail. With the multitude of the relationships that were tested (the influence of traits) the article needs more coherence.</p>

<p>We thank Reviewer 3 for these suggestions. We revised the introduction and discussion to better contextualize species’ responses to climate change and the mechanisms behind them (see details below). We carefully reviewed all figures and captions, and made changes to improve the clarity of the text and the presentation of results (see details below).</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p>
<p>Comment:</p>
<p>(1) Following weakness #1 in the public review, the authors should review the habitat classifications, consult with an odonatologist, and reclassify many species from Both to Lentic and redo the analysis.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for pointing out this disagreement among expert habitat classifications that we cited and other literature. We reclassified species’ habitat preferences based on classifications by Hof et al., a source that was consistent with your suggestions, and identified additional species as Lentic that our other references had identified as Both. We performed our analysis with this new dataset and, as you suspected, our results did not change qualitatively: species habitat preferences did not predict their range shifts.</p>

<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Comment:</p>
<p>(2) Following weakness #2, would it be worthwhile or interesting to analyze a smaller ranging group (e.g. cut the quad size in half, 50 x 50 km) to bring in more species and potentially change the inference? Or is the paper too tightly constructed to allow this, even as a secondary piece?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for this comment, as it highlights an important consideration for macroecological analyses, and the importance of balancing multiple factors for determining quadrat size. Issues exist with identifying drivers of range boundaries among species with narrow ranges when they are analyzed separately from wide-ranging species, and examining larger quadrats can actually help clarify drivers (Szabo, Algar, and Kerr 2009). The smaller quadrats are, the higher the likelihood that the species is actually there but was never observed, or that the quadrat only covers unsuitable habitat and the species is absent from the entire (or almost entire) quadrat. Too many absences creates issues with violating model assumptions, and creates noise that makes it difficult to identify drivers of species’ range and phenology shifts.</p>
<p>Moreover, we constructed extensive null models that show that range and phenology changes, respectively, are contrary to expectations that arise from sampling difference. 100km quadrats make for a reasonable “middle-ground”, and we have included a brief explanation of this in the text: “We assigned species presences to 100×100 km quadrats, a scale that is large enough to maintain adequate sampling intensity but still relevant to conservation and policy (Soroye et al., 2020), to identify the best sampled species.”  (Lines 170-172).</p>

<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Comment:</p>
<p>(3) Following weakness #3, are specialists the ones that &quot;failed to shift&quot; (L18)? If so please specify. The prediction about generalists vs specialists needs to be removed or incorporated in other parts of the paper.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for pointing this out, we intended to suggest that species with more generalist habitat requirements might be better able to shift, but ultimately found that traits did not predict species’ shifts. We corrected our prediction regarding habitat generalists as follows: “We predicted that species able to use both lentic and lotic habitats would shift their phenologies and geographies more than those able to use just one habitat type, as generalists outperform specialists as climate and land uses change (Ball-Damerow et al., 2015, 2014; Hassall and Thompson, 2008; Powney et al., 2015; Rapacciuolo et al., 2017).” (Lines 128-132).</p>

<p>(6) L163-173: I am not familiar with this analysis but it sounds interesting and promising, I am not sure if this can be clarified further. Why the -25 to 25, and -30 to 30, doesn't the -35 to 35 cover these?

<p>We used different cutoffs for phenology shifts to inspect for outliers that were likely to be errors, potentially do to insufficient sampling to calculate phenology. We clarified in the text as follows:</p>
<p>“We retained emergence estimates between March 1st and September 1st, as well as species and quadrats that showed a difference in emergence phenology of -25 to 25 days, -30 to 30 days, or -35 to 35 days between both time periods, to include only phenology shifts that could be biologically meaningful to environmental climate change (i.e. exclude errors).” (Lines 169-173).</p>

<p>Thank you for this suggestion, and for making us aware of the thinking around range geographies as ecological traits. We have specified throughout the manuscript that the ‘traits’ we are considering are ‘functional traits’, changed the methods subsection title to “Range geographies and functional traits” (Line 252), and added a brief discussion of ecological traits: “Geographic range and associated climatic characteristics are often considered ecological traits, as they are consequences of functional traits and their interactions with geographic features (Bried and Rocha-Ortega, 2023; Chichorro et al., 2019).” (Lines 256-259).</p>
<p>Comment:</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(8) L203: What's the rationale for egg-laying habitat as &quot;biologically relevant to spatial and temporal responses to climate change&quot;? That one's not as obvious as the others and needs a sentence more. Also, I am wondering why other traits were not considered here, like color lightness and voltinism. And why not wing size instead of body size, or better yet the two combined (wing loading) as a proxy for dispersal ability?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree that our rationale for using this trait should be better explained, and we have included the following explanation: “Egg laying habitat was assigned according to whether species use exophytic egg-laying habitat (i.e. eggs laid in water or on land, relatively larger in number), or endophytic egg-laying habitat (i.e. eggs laid inside plants, usually fewer in number); species using exophytic habitats are associated with greater northward range limit shifts (Angert et al., 2011).” (Lines 271-275).</p>
<p>We considered traits that have been found to be important for range and phenology shifts among odonates, as well as being key traits for expectations for species responses to climate change. Flight duration and body size are correlated with dispersal ability (Powney et al. 2015). Body size is also correlated with competitive ability (Powney et al. 2015), potentially making it an important predictor of a species’ ability to establish and maintain populations in expanding range areas. Traits correlated with range shifts also include breeding habitat type (Powney et al. 2015; Bowler et al. 2021) and egg laying habitat (Angert et al. 2011). Ideally, we would have used dispersal data from mark/release/recapture studies, but it was not available for many of the species included in this study. After finding that none of the functional traits we included were related to range shifts, there was no reason to believe that a further investigation of traits would be meaningful.</p>

<p>We have clarified this section as follows: “While warm-adapted species with more equatorial distributions could expand their ranges poleward following warming (Devictor et al., 2008), they could also increase in abundance in this new range area relative to species that historically occupied those areas and are less heat-tolerant (Powney et al., 2015).” (Lines 95-121).</p>

<p>Thank you for pointing this out, we intended to suggest that species with more generalist habitat requirements might be better able to shift, but ultimately found that traits did not predict species’ shifts. We corrected our prediction regarding habitat generalists as follows: “We predicted that species able to use both lentic and lotic habitats would shift their phenologies and geographies more than those able to use just one habitat type, as generalists outperform specialists as climate and land uses change (Ball-Damerow et al., 2015, 2014; Hassall and Thompson, 2008; Powney et al., 2015; Rapacciuolo et al., 2017).” (Lines 128-132).</p>

<p>Thank you for sharing this paper, as it offers a valuable perspective on the study of species’ ranges. While our dataset is substantially composed of observations from adult sampling protocols, unlike the suggested paper which compares adults and juveniles, this is an interesting alternative approach.</p>
<p>For our purposes it is meaningful to include outliers, as otherwise we may have missed individuals at the leading edge of range expansions. Our intent here was to detect range limits, as opposed to finding the central tendency of species distributions. This approach is widely accepted in the macroecology literature (i.e. Devictor et al., 2012, 2008; Kerr et al. 2015).</p>
<p>We have included the following discussion of our approach in the methods section:</p>
<p>“We followed widely accepted methods to determine species range boundaries (Devictor et al., 2012, 2008; Kerr et al., 2015), although other methods exist that are appropriate for different data types and research questions i.e. (Ni and Vellend, 2021). We assigned species presences to 100×100 km quadrats, a scale that is large enough to maintain adequate sampling intensity but still relevant to conservation and policy (Soroye et al., 2020), to identify the best sampled species.” (Lines 168-173).</p>

More southerly lentic species may expand their range boundaries more than lotic species, as species accustomed to ephemeral lentic habitats better dispersers (Grewe et al., 2013), yet lotic species have also been found to expand their ranges more often than lentic species, potentially due to the loss of lentic habitat in some areas (Bowler et al., 2021).” (Lines 88-95).</p>

<p>Thank you for this suggestion, we weren’t aware of this issue with Odonata Central. We used the CoordinaterCleaner tool in R to filter all odonate records that we used in our analyses.

<p>This issue highlights a challenge in the global biology literature and around the issue of biodiversity monitoring for understanding global change impacts on species. Almost no studies have been able to report simultaneous range and phenology shifts, and the literature addresses these biotic responses to global change predominantly as distinct phenomena.

We are happy to expand links to natural history of this group and have added the following: “This group also includes Coenagrion resolutum, a common North American damselfly (Swaegers et al., 2014), for which we could not find evidence of decline. This may be due in part to the greater area of intact habitat available in North American compared to Europe, enabling C. resolutum to maintain larger populations that are less vulnerable to stochastic climate events. Still, this and other species failing to shift in range or phenology should be assessed for population health, as this species could be carrying an unobserved extinction debt.” (Lines 527-533).</p>

<p>(44) L375-377: This last sentence is very similar to L371-373. Please reduce the redundancy. Focus more on specifically stating the process instead of vaguely saying 'new insights into patterns' and 'suggesting processes'. Rather, deliver a strong concluding message here.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for this suggestion, we feel that we now have a much stronger concluding message: “By considering both the seasonal and range dynamics of species, emergent and convergent climate change responses across continents become clear for this well-studied group of predatory insects.” (Lines 545-547).</p>

<p>(45) Table 1: To me, the few estimates presented here do not justify a table. rather include them in the text. OR combine them with Table 2. Also, why not include the traits as predictors (from the range shift models) in these models as well?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have clarified in the text that the results displayed in Table 1 are from the analysis of the relationship between range and phenology shifts: “The effect of species’ range shifts on phenology range shifts was significant in our model investigating the relationship between these responses, indicating that species shifting their northern range limits to higher latitudes also showed stronger advances in their emergence phenology (Figure 3).” (Lines 341-344).</p>
<p>As there were no significant effects in the model of phenology change drivers, we have not shown results of this model: “Emergence phenology shifts were not affected by species’ traits, range geography, nor climate variability; due to this, model results are not displayed here.” (Lines 383-384).</p>

<p>Comment:</p>
<p>(46) Table 2: L712-713: What does this mean? Are phenology shifts not used as a predictor of range shifts? (why then this comment?). Or do you want to say phenological shifts are not related to Southern range etc? Why do you present a phylosig here but not in Table 1? Why not include the traits as predictors (from the range shift models) in these models as well? Consider using the range size as a continuous predictor instead of 'Widespread'.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We are glad the reviewer pointed this out to us. We did not emphasize this issue sufficiently. We DID evaluate traits as predictors both of geographical range and phenological shifts, and species-specific biological traits did not significantly affect models predicting either of those sets of responses. We state this on Lines 312-323, but we have also noted in the discussion (Lines 473-476) that the most commonly assessed traits, like body size, do not alter observed trends here. Instead, where species are found, rather than the characteristics of species, is the key determinant of their overall responses.</p>
<p>Following this excellent suggestion, we re-analysed our data using range size, calculated as the number of quadrats occupied by a species in the historical time period, as a predictor. Range size was not significant in our models, but we believe this is the best way to analyze our data, and so have updated our methods (Lines 261-263) and results (375-378).</p>

<p>(47) Figure 1: I don't see any grey points in the figure. Also, there is no A or B. If you are referring to the symbols then write cross and triangle instead and not use capital letters which usually refer to component plots of composite figures. Also, I highly recommend providing a similar figure based on your data (maybe each species as a dot for T1 and another symbol for T2). Given the small number of species, you could try to connect these points with arrows. For the set with only range shifts maybe play the T2-dots at the center of the 'Emergence' axis.</p>

<p>Thank you for pointing out this error: a previous version of Figure 1 included grey points and multiple panels. We have removed this text from the figure caption to be consistent with the final version of the figure (Line 989).</p>
<p>The graphical depictions of the conceptual and empirical discoveries in this paper were challenging to create. The reviewer might be suggesting effectively decomposing Figure 3 (change in range on the y axis vs change in phenology among all species into two sets of points on the same graph, where each pair of points is a before and after value for each species. This would make for a very busy figure indeed. We have modified the conceptual Figure 1 to illustrate more clearly, we believe, that species can (in principle) remain within tolerable niche spaces by shifting their activity periods in time (phenology) or in space (geographical range) or both.</p>

<p>(48) Figure 2: Please add a legend. Also black is a poor background color. The maps appear to be stretched. Please check aspect ratios. Now here are capital letters without an explanation in the caption. From the context I assume the upper panel maps are for the data used to calculate range shifts at the bottom panel maps are for data used to calculate the phenological shifts.</p>

<p>We apologise for the error in the figure caption and have clarified the differences between panels in the text, as well as changing the map background colour and fixing the aspect ratio:</p>

Species richness per 100 × 100 km quadrat is shown in panes A and B, while panes C and D show species richness per 200 × 200 km quadrat. Dark red indicates high species richness, while light pink indicates low species richness.” (Lines 1002-1006).</p>

<p>We originally included information on species range geography, including southern versus northern range, and widespread versus not, into one categorical variable. Following additional comments we re-analysed our data using range size, calculated as the number of quadrats occupied by a species in the historical time period, as a predictor. Now the methods section text (Lines 261-263) and Table 1 report results of that variable with distribution options northern, southern, or both.</p>

<p>Comment:</p>
<p>(53) Figure S5 and S6: It would be more coherent if the colors refer to the continents and the suborders are indicated by shading. I would love to see a combination of the two figures with species ordered by the phylogenetic relationship and a dot matrix indicating the traits in the main text! This could really be a good starting point for a synthesis figure.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The reviewer presents an interesting challenge for us. We have a choice, as we understand things, to present a figure showing phylogeny and traits (as requested here), or an ordered list of species relative to effect sizes in the two main responses to global change. The latter choice centers on the discoveries of the paper, while the former would be valuable for dragonfly biology but would depict information that proved to be biologically uninformative relative to our discovery. That is to say, there is no phylogenetic trend and biological traits among species did not affect results. We have gone some way toward illustrating that issue by retaining phylogeny in the MCMC-GLMM models, but we feel that a figure illustrating phylogeny and traits would (for most readers, at least) illustrate noise, rather than signal. For this reason, we have opted to take on the previous reviewer’s suggestion for a modified, main-text Figure 4, which we include below.</p>
<p>Figure 4: Distribution of Northern range limit shifts (Panel A, kilometers) and emergence phenology shift (Panel B, Julian day) of 76 European and North American odonate species between a recent time period (2008 - 2018) and a historical time period (1980 - 2002). Anisoptera (dragonflies) are shown in pink, Zygoptera (damselflies) are shown in blue.</p>
<p>Change last: Figure 3: Relationship between range shifts and emergence phenology shifts among North American and European odonate species (N = 66; model R2 = 17.08 for glm, 14.9% for MCMCglmm). For reference, the shaded area shows mean latitudinal range shifts of terrestrial taxa as reported by Lenoir et al. (2020; calculated as the yearly mean dispersal rate of 1.11 +/- 0.96 km per year over 38 years).</p>
