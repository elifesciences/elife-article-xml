<title>Abstract</title>
<p>The circadian clock enables anticipation of the day/night cycle in animals ranging from cnidarians to mammals. Circadian rhythms are generated through a transcription-translation feedback loop (TTFL or pacemaker) with CLOCK as a conserved positive factor in animals. However, CLOCK’s functional evolutionary origin and mechanism of action in basal animals are unknown. In the cnidarian <italic>Nematostella vectensis</italic>, pacemaker gene transcript levels, including <italic>NvClk</italic> (the <italic>Clock</italic> ortholog), appear arrhythmic under constant darkness, questioning the role of NvCLK. Utilizing CRISPR/Cas9, we generated a <italic>NvClk</italic> allele mutant (<italic>NvClk<sup>Δ</sup></italic>), revealing circadian behavior loss in constant light conditions (LL and DD) while a 24-hour rhythm was maintained under light-dark condition (LD). Transcriptomics showed distinct rhythmic genes in wild-type (WT) genes in LD compared to DD. The LD <italic>NvClk<sup>Δ/Δ</sup></italic> showed comparable numbers of rhythmic genes, but were greatly reduced in DD. Furthermore, the LD <italic>NvClk<sup>Δ/Δ</sup></italic> showed alterations in temporal pacemaker gene expression, affecting their potential interactions. Additionally, differential expression of non-rhythmic genes associated with cell division and neuronal differentiation was observed. These findings revealed that a light-responsive pathway can partially compensate for circadian clock disruption and that the <italic>Clock</italic> gene has evolved in cnidarians to synchronize rhythmic physiology and behavior to the diel rhythm of the earth’s biosphere.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Throughout the history of life on Earth, organisms have had to adapt to a constantly changing environment, including the ∼24-hour daily rhythm of light/dark, driving the development of endogenous biological clocks. The circadian clock, entrained by external stimuli such as light, enables the organism to anticipate the onset of the light and dark phases and synchronize its physiology and behavior in harmony with the environment. This, in turn, enhances the organism’s fitness and survival<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. From single-celled organisms to metazoans, circadian clocks have evolved multiple times, highlighting their importance to living organisms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. Despite the fundamental role circadian clocks play in regulating the rhythmicity of living organisms, their evolutionary origin and intricate molecular mechanisms remain ambiguous in early diverging animal lineages, such as cnidaria.</p>
<p>Rhythmic phenomena, including calcification, reproduction, and diel behavior patterns, have been examined in cnidarian species<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. While environmental stimuli, such as light, directly triggered some of these patterns, others persist in the absence of external cues, suggesting the presence of an internally generated and self-sustaining circadian clock<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>. At the molecular level, cnidarians possess homologs of putative core pacemaker genes found in bilaterians<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. Several studies have shown that most of these genes display diel expression patterns under light/dark cycles. However, unlike most animals, their oscillation generally ceases without light cues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. Thus, how the core pacemaker genes orchestrate rhythmic gene expression and circadian behaviors in cnidarians remains unclear.</p>
<p>One of the most studied cnidarian species in the field of chronobiology is the estuarine sea anemone, <italic>Nematostella vectensis</italic>. Few studies have shown that in diel lighting, the locomotor behavior of <italic>Nematostella</italic> has a ∼24-h rhythm that is maintained under constant conditions, suggesting it is regulated by an endogenous circadian clock<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. By this, the <italic>Nematostella</italic> genome codes for conserved core pacemaker genes such as <italic>NvClk</italic>, <italic>NvCycle</italic>, and the cryptochromes <italic>NvCry1a</italic> and <italic>NvCry1b</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. The proposed circadian clock model in <italic>Nematostella</italic> is composed of the positive transcription factors (bHLH-PAS family), NvCLK and NvCYCLE, that heterodimerize and upregulate light-dependent cryptochrome genes in the feedback loop, and NvPAR-bZIPs in the feed-forward loop, which repress the transcription of the positive elements<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. More recently, the NvCLK-interacting pacemaker, NvCIPC, was predicted to act as an additional repressor of the NvCLK:NvCYCLE dimer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. However, in contrast to the free-running oscillation demonstrated for <italic>Nematostella</italic> behavior<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>, transcriptional expression profiles of most candidate genes implicated in the pacemaker do not retain their oscillation period without light<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>We employed the CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing system to establish a <italic>NvClk</italic> mutant (<italic>NvClk<sup>Δ/Δ</sup></italic>) <italic>Nematostella</italic>. By combining behavioral monitoring and transcriptomic analysis, we aimed to elucidate the role of <italic>NvClk</italic> in regulating rhythmic locomotor activity and gene expression under varying light conditions. Our study revealed a robust light response pathway capable of compensation and a conserved function of CLOCK as a timekeeper without a light cue.</p>

<title>Generation of <italic>NvClk<sup>Δ/Δ</sup></italic> Nematostella</title>
<p>To investigate the function of <italic>NvClk</italic> in Nematostella, we employed the CRISPR-Cas9 system to generate mutants. Based on existing knowledge from mouse and Drosophila models, we hypothesized that NvCLK:NvCYCLE dimer binds to the DNA motif CACGTG within the promoter of rhythmic target genes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>). Guide RNA (gRNA) was synthesized to target a region between the two PAS domains of the <italic>NvClk</italic> coding sequence (CDS). This gRNA and the Cas9 endonuclease were microinjected into zygotes (Methods). Subsequently, F0 animals were outcrossed with wild type (WT), and the F1 progeny were raised to adulthood. Genotyping of F1 polyps identified ten different mutated alleles, with six displaying a frame-shift mutation, including one with a 20 bp insertion (<italic>NvClk<sup>Δ</sup></italic>), resulting in a premature stop codon (<xref rid="figed1" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 1b</xref>). The predicted 203 amino acid truncated protein lacked 459 amino acids, including one co-factor dimerization PAS domain (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>, <xref rid="figed1" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 1b</xref>). To obtain homozygous <italic>NvClk<sup>Δ/Δ</sup></italic> polyps, we crossed heterozygous <italic>NvClk<sup>Δ</sup></italic> F1 animals. Genotyping of F2 polyps confirmed the expected 25% frequency of <italic>NvClk<sup>Δ/Δ</sup></italic> mutants. Subsequently, we intercrossed <italic>NvClk<sup>Δ/Δ</sup></italic> animals to obtain F3 <italic>NvClk<sup>Δ/Δ</sup></italic> polyps for use in subsequent experiments aimed at assessing the role of <italic>NvClk</italic> in regulating behavioral and genetic rhythms.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2c">
<title><italic>NvClk</italic> is necessary to maintain circadian behavior in constant conditions</title>
<p>To assess the impact of the <italic>NvClk<sup>Δ</sup></italic> mutation on circadian rhythm, we monitored the locomotor behavior of WT and <italic>NvClk<sup>Δ/Δ</sup></italic> polyps under different light conditions (Supp. Table 1). Both the WT and <italic>NvClk<sup>Δ/Δ</sup></italic> populations exhibited a 24-hour periodicity in 12:12 hour Light-Dark (LD) cycles (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d, e</xref>), with 15 out of 21 WT animals displaying 24-hour rhythmicity compared to only 9 out of 20 <italic>NvClk<sup>Δ/Δ</sup></italic> animals (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1f</xref>, <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, Supp. Table 2). The average acrophase for WT polyps (13.3 hours) was significantly earlier than for <italic>NvClk<sup>Δ/Δ</sup></italic> polyps (17.3 hours) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1f</xref>, <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). While we could detect a 24-hour rhythm for both genotypes, the delayed acrophase and reduced number of significant rhythmic polyps in the <italic>NvClk<sup>Δ/Δ</sup></italic> suggest an alteration of the underlying rhythmicity mechanism.</p>
<table-wrap id="tbl1" orientation="portrait" position="float">
<label>Table 1.</label>
<caption><title>Summary of rhythmic analysis of individual behavior.</title></caption>
<graphic xlink:href="534918v6_tbl1.tif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/>
</table-wrap>
<p>We then investigated locomotor behavior under continuous conditions, namely continuous dark (DD) or continuous light (LL). WT polyps exhibited a 22-hour rhythmic behavior under both constant light conditions, with 17 out of 25 WT polyps displaying a 24-hour rhythm under DD and 7 out of 25 under LL (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1g-l</xref>). In contrast, a few <italic>NvClk<sup>Δ/Δ</sup></italic> polyps displayed rhythmic behavior under constant conditions (1 out of 24 in DD and 1 out of 26 in LL) (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Additionally, we observed an intermediate phenotype in the locomotor behavior of heterozygous polyps for the <italic>NvClk<sup>Δ</sup></italic> allele in DD (<xref rid="figed1" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 1c-f</xref>). These results revealed that <italic>NvClk<sup>Δ/Δ</sup></italic> polyps could not maintain circadian rhythmicity without diel light cues.</p>
<p>A 24-hour rhythm of <italic>NvClk<sup>Δ/Δ</sup></italic> polyps under LD conditions could be attributed to either direct light response or the partial functioning of the circadian clock due to the nature of the mutation. To distinguish between these two possibilities, we monitored locomotor activity under a 6-hour light: 6-hour dark (LD 6:6) cycle after a regular diel 72-hour entrainment under 12:12 LD. While WT polyps maintained a marginally significant periodicity of 22 hours, <italic>NvClk<sup>Δ/Δ</sup></italic> polyps displayed a 12-hour rhythm at the population level (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1m-o</xref>). Specifically, we identified a clear difference of 12-hour rhythmic individual polyps between WT and <italic>NvClk<sup>Δ/Δ</sup></italic> groups (1 out of 25 WT polyps vs. 13 out of 26 <italic>NvClk<sup>Δ/Δ</sup></italic> polyps) (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Notably, entrainment with LD 6:6 did not lead to a 12-hour rhythm in DD for both WT and <italic>NvClk<sup>Δ/Δ</sup></italic> polyps (<xref rid="figed1" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 1g-i</xref>). These results support the hypothesis that the 24-hour rhythm observed in the <italic>NvClk<sup>Δ/Δ</sup></italic> polyps in LD condition is due to the light-response pathway and not from an endogenous oscillator.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2d">
<title><italic>NvClk</italic> regulates rhythmic gene expression differentially in response to light conditions</title>
<p>We conducted transcriptional profiling to investigate the underlying molecular correlates of the behavioral phenotype found in <italic>NvClk<sup>Δ/Δ</sup></italic> polyps. WT and <italic>NvClk<sup>Δ/Δ</sup></italic> polyps were sampled seven times every 4 hours over 24 hours under LD and DD conditions (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>). To identify rhythmic genes, we employed stringent statistical parameters, including Benjamini-Hochberg (BH.Q) for the JTK method<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup> and adjusted p-value (p.adj) for the RAIN method<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>. This resulted in the identification of a minimal number of rhythmic genes. We detected only six rhythmic genes under LD conditions in WT polyps using the JTK method and 40 rhythmic genes using the RAIN method (Supp. Table 3). In DD condition, in the WT polyps, only two rhythmic genes were identified using the RAIN method (Supp. Table 3). Despite the risk of false positives, we opted not to use multiple testing but instead proposed to combine the JTK and RAIN algorithms to identify rhythmic genes, ensuring a robust approach to data analysis (p&lt;0.01). We identified 119 rhythmic genes rhythmic under LD and 107 rhythmic genes under DD in WT polyps (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref>, Supp. Table 3). In <italic>NvClk<sup>Δ/Δ</sup></italic> polyps, we detected 147 rhythmic genes under LD and only 37 under DD (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref>, Supp. Table 3).</p>

<p>The rhythmic genes in WT polyps displayed a delayed acrophase under DD compared to LD (17.20h vs. 12.93h, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref>). However, no differences were detected between LD and DD rhythmic genes in <italic>NvClk<sup>Δ/Δ</sup></italic> polyps (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d</xref>). Similarly, the relative amplitude (the gene amplitude divided by its baseline, rAMP) of DD rhythmic genes was higher in WT polyps compared to LD (0.61 vs. 0.43, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2e</xref>), but no rAMP difference was observed between LD and DD rhythmic genes in <italic>NvClk<sup>Δ/Δ</sup></italic> polyps (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2f</xref>).</p>
<p>Are rhythmic genes organized into “transcriptional time clusters”? Does the <italic>NvClk<sup>Δ</sup></italic> mutation modify cluster recruitments, causing the loss of rhythmic behavior under DD conditions? We performed a clustering analysis on the rhythmic genes using the DPGP model (Dirichlet process Gaussian process mixture model). The number of genes per cluster between LD and DD conditions in WT polyps did not differ significantly (7.3 vs. 7.6, <xref rid="figed2" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 2a</xref>, Supp. Table 4). Interestingly, when clusters are organized by their acrophase, we observed clusters with higher numbers of genes peaking at subjective night in WT under DD conditions (<xref rid="figed2" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 2b</xref>, Supp. Table 4). In <italic>NvClk<sup>Δ/Δ</sup></italic> polyps, the number of genes per cluster was significantly reduced in DD compared to the LD condition (4.1 vs. 8.6, <xref rid="figed2" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 2c,d</xref>). We did not identify GO-term enrichment in any cluster. However, the overlap between clusters and behavior opens new directions for further functional analysis (<xref rid="figed3" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 3b,d</xref> and Supp. Table 4). Overall, the reduced number of rhythmic genes in <italic>NvClk<sup>Δ/Δ</sup></italic> polyps under the DD condition and the reduced number of genes per cluster confirm the necessity of <italic>NvClk</italic> to recruit rhythmic genes in the DD condition and to organize them in transcriptional time clusters.</p>

<p>To systematically assess the mutation’s impact on all the potential pacemaker genes, we utilized a correlation matrix based on their temporal transcript number levels, offering a comprehensive overview of their temporal organization. In WT polyps under LD conditions, the clustering categorized genes into two groups: one exhibiting a daytime peaking, containing <italic>NvClk</italic>, and another peaking at night comprising <italic>NvPar-bzipc</italic> and <italic>NvCipc</italic>. Notably, in LD <italic>NvClk<sup>Δ/Δ</sup></italic> polyps, this second cluster contained two additional genes and displayed a weakened anticorrelation with the <italic>NvClk</italic> cluster (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref>). These observations suggest that the pacemaker oscillation, generated by the interplay of positive and negative feedback loops, relies on the precise temporal organization of these potential pacemaker factors into distinct clusters. The disruption of this organization by the <italic>NvClk<sup>Δ</sup></italic> allele underscores the central role of <italic>NvClk</italic> in pacemaker function.</p>
<p>To go further into the regulatory mechanisms downstream of the pacemaker, we examined the presence of circadian E-box motifs (CACGTG) within 5kb upstream of the predicted ATG of rhythmic genes. We calculated circadian/canonical E-box enrichment to account for the total variation in the number of canonical E-boxes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3c</xref>). Notably, only the candidate pacemaker genes exhibited a significant enrichment in circadian E-boxes in their promoters (15.9%) compared to the WT (5.6%), <italic>NvClk<sup>Δ/Δ</sup></italic> (4.8%) rhythmic genes, and non-rhythmic genes (6.8%) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3d</xref>).</p>

<title>Conserved behavioral CLOCK function through animal evolution</title>
<p>Our study provides valuable insights into the evolution of circadian clocks by characterizing the effects of the first <italic>Clock</italic> mutation in a cnidarian, the sea anemone <italic>Nematostella vectensis</italic>. Our behavioral assays showed that <italic>NvClk</italic> is essential for maintaining rhythmic locomotor activity without an entraining light cue. Although the rhythmicity of the <italic>NvClk<sup>+/Δ</sup></italic> heterozygote polyps was affected in DD, our results could not discriminate a dominant-negative from a total loss of function to identify the nature of this mutation (<xref rid="figed1" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 1g-i</xref>). Studies in various model organisms further support the importance of CLOCK in regulating circadian locomotion. For instance, <italic>DmClk<sup>ar/ar</sup></italic> flies exhibit a loss of circadian locomotion in constant darkness<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>, while the <italic>DnClk1a<sup>dg</sup></italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup><italic><sup>/dg</sup></italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup> zebrafish mutant displayed a shortened period under the same conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>.

Overall, these findings support a conserved role of CLOCK in preserving circadian behavioral rhythms in the absence of light cues across the distant <italic>Nematostella</italic>, flies, zebrafish, and mice.</p>
<p>Moreover, the conservation of a 24-hour locomotion rhythm in LD of the <italic>NvClk<sup>Δ/Δ</sup></italic> polyps with a delayed acrophase revealed a light-response pathway independent of the circadian circuit, consistent with observations in other animal models<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1f</xref>). <italic>NvClk<sup>Δ/Δ</sup></italic> polyps exposed to a 12:12h LD cycle exhibited a 24-hour period. In contrast, those exposed to a 6:6h LD cycle displayed a 12-hour period. Notably, nearly no WT polyps exhibited a 12-hour rhythm under this condition, suggesting that the circadian clock overrides the light-response pathway (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5a</xref>). While some of the circadian factors can directly sense the light, such as CRY proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>, 29 putative <italic>NvOpsin</italic> have been identified in the genome which could be involved in the light-response pathway<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>.

<title>Transcriptional rhythmicity plasticity downstream <italic>NvClk</italic></title>
<p>At the transcriptomic level, previous studies in <italic>Nematostella</italic> have shown large changes in the transcriptional profile of many genes after a single day of constant darkness, including the candidate pacemaker genes that were found arrhythmic despite sustaining circadian locomotion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>. Consistent with previous transcriptomic analysis in cnidarian<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>, most of the rhythmic genes identified in LD differed from those identified in DD in the WT polyps. Notably, they displayed higher mean acrophase and larger mean amplitude in DD, suggesting a differential regulation in response to light conditions, which had not been investigated in previous cnidarian studies. Furthermore, the overlap observed between our LD rhythmic genes and those identified by Leach et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup> underscores the robustness of pacemaker rhythmic transcription in LD conditions (<xref rid="figed3" ref-type="fig">Extended data Fig. 3</xref>). However, the lack of overlap for rhythmic genes raises intriguing questions. Differences in experimental conditions, including genetic backgrounds, light system (Neon vs. LED), salinity (12ppt vs. 15ppt), and temperature (17°C vs. 25°C), may contribute to these discrepancies. Further investigations are necessary to determine if the lack of overlap of rhythmic genes downstream of the potential pacemaker genes results from an organism’s adaptation to its environment and, therefore, reflects the plasticity of the pacemaker in regulating its downstream rhythmic genes.</p>
<p>Our study identified 24-hour rhythmic behavior in <italic>NvClk<sup>Δ/Δ</sup></italic> polyps under LD conditions, suggesting an alternative mechanism for generating molecular rhythmicity via the light-sensing pathway. However, it is crucial to note minimal overlap between the rhythmic genes identified in <italic>NvClk<sup>Δ/Δ</sup></italic> and WT polyps under LD conditions. This discrepancy indicates that the light-response pathway may not fully replicate the normal pacemaker functions observed in WT polyps, highlighting the need for further investigation into the recruitment and function of these genes. Additionally, the reduced number of rhythmic genes identified in <italic>NvClk<sup>Δ/Δ</sup></italic> polyps under the DD condition underscores the crucial role of <italic>NvClk</italic> in maintaining molecular rhythm without light cues.</p>
<p>The clustering analysis revealed that rhythmic genes can be categorized into “transcriptional time clusters” (aka synexpression clusters)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup> by group of seven/eight genes in average in the WT (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5b</xref>). Their existence raises a fundamental question that has yet to be answered: How is a group of genes co-regulated in time and space (cell types) by the pacemaker? Their recruitment is disrupted in the DD <italic>NvClk<sup>Δ/Δ</sup></italic> polyps suggesting an essential function of <italic>NvClk</italic> in absence of light. The combination of published scAtlas<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup> and multiplexed FISH techniques<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup> will be essential to further investigate the biological regulation and function of these transcriptional time clusters.</p>

<title><italic>NvClk</italic> temporally organizes pacemaker gene expression to drive rhythmic gene recruitment</title>
<p>Our study reveals that <italic>NvClk</italic> plays a crucial role in regulating the temporal transcription of pacemaker candidate genes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig.3a</xref>). Our analysis identified two clusters of pacemaker genes: One containing <italic>NvClk</italic> and a second one containing a potential <italic>NvClk</italic> inhibitor (<italic>NvCipc</italic>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>. These two clusters suggest the organization of the potential pacemaker genes transcription into interlock feedback loops with antiphase peaks, probably at the origin of the pacemaker oscillator function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>. The alteration of cluster composition with a weaker anticorrelation in LD <italic>NvClk<sup>Δ/Δ</sup></italic> polyps might generate a desynchronization of the pacemaker factors’ availability. Indeed, regulation of rhythmic transcription involved a complex protein-protein-DNA timing interaction. Furthermore, we did not identify any circadian E-boxes enrichment in rhythmic genes between conditions, except for the candidate pacemaker genes. Altogether, this supports the function of <italic>NvClk</italic> in orchestrating the timing interaction of pacemaker factors to select downstream rhythmic genes, indicating a more complex regulatory landscape at play.</p>
<p>However, one significant unanswered question in our study is the reason for the arrhythmic transcription of putative pacemaker genes in DD. Using whole animals for sampling material might mask oscillating gene expression signals, especially if signals are present in a small number of cells or if tissues exhibit rhythmic gene expression in different phases. Furthermore, we must acknowledge a limitation in our interpretation, which is common in chronobiology: using RNA oscillation as a proxy for protein oscillation and function. The development of tools to study the pacemaker factors at the protein level in <italic>Nematostella</italic> will leverage this limitation in the field.</p>

<title><italic>NvClk</italic> regulates processes involved in cell proliferation and the neural system in the absence of light</title>
<p>Our study of <italic>NvClk</italic> suggests coordination of cellular processes, especially in the absence of light. Our rhythmic transcriptomic analysis results (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> and <xref rid="figed2" ref-type="fig">Extended data Fig. 2</xref>) raised questions regarding indirect effects and the non-rhythmic function of <italic>NvClk</italic>. We performed a differential gene expression analysis on the total transcriptome for each light condition. Under LD conditions, while <italic>NvClk<sup>Δ/Δ</sup></italic> polyps exhibited significant changes in gene expression, we could not identify any GO term enrichment (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref>, Supp. Table 5), revealing multiple altered processes we cannot yet identify.</p>
<p>In contrast, under DD conditions, <italic>NvClk<sup>Δ/Δ</sup></italic> polyps displayed more pronounced alterations, with more DEGs and enriched GO-terms for down-regulated genes related to mitosis, microtubule organization, and ciliary/flagellar motility, while the up-regulated genes showed enrichment in processes such as the modulation of other organism’s processes, axonal guidance, and sensory perception (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b</xref>, Supp. Table 5). These results imply that <italic>NvClk</italic> has non-circadian functions dependent on light availability. This is particularly noteworthy considering the expression of core pacemaker genes, known to be arrhythmic during larvae stages, potentially involved in developmental processes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>This study provides novel insights into circadian regulation in <italic>Nematostella vectensis</italic> and sheds light on the evolutionary origin of circadian time maintenance. Our findings indicate that CLOCK function is conserved from cnidaria to mammals to maintain rhythmicity without diel light cues. Furthermore, it revealed a light-response pathway able to compensate at both behavioral and molecular levels using light cues. This circadian clock mutant opens new avenues for investigating cell-type-specific mechanisms of the circadian clock that drive the molecular and phenotypical oscillations of cnidarians. By further exploring the circadian clock mechanisms in cnidarians, we can gain deeper insights into the evolutionary origins of this critical aspect of biology, enhancing our understanding of how organisms have evolved to keep track of time and adapt to their environment.</p>

<p><italic>Nematostella</italic> were grown in 12g.L sea salt water at 17°C, and fed with Artemia <italic>salina nauplii</italic> three times a week. Spawning of gametes and fertilization was performed according to a published protocol<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>. In brief, temperature was raised to 25 °C for 9 h and the animals were exposed to strong white light. Three hours after the induction, oocytes were mixed with sperm to allow fertilization.</p>

<title>CRISPR/Cas9 mediated mutagenesis</title>
<p>Genome editing in <italic>Nematostella</italic> was carried out following established CRISPR/Cas9 protocols, with slight modifications<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>. ZiFiT targeting software (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://zifit.partners.org/">http://zifit.partners.org/</ext-link>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup> was used to select a guide RNA (gRNA) target site within the beginning of the <italic>NvClk</italic> exon and to design complementary oligonucleotides. To ensure specificity of the gRNA, the selected target site sequence (GGTCCTCTCGTGGACTCTAC) was BLASTed against <italic>Nematostella vectensis</italic> genome (using JGI expected E value threshold of 0.1 to adjust for short sequences: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://genome.jgi.doe.gov/Nemve1/Nemve1.home.html">http://genome.jgi.doe.gov/Nemve1/Nemve1.home.html</ext-link>). To generate the gRNA template, the following oligonucleotides were used:</p>
<p>Oligo 1: 5’- TAGGTCCTCTCGTGGACTCTAC -3’</p>
<p>Oligo 2: 5’- AAACGTAGAGTCCACGAGAGGA -3’</p>
<p>To construct the gRNA expression vector, pDR274 (plasmid # 42250; Addgene) was digested with the <italic>BsaI</italic> restriction enzyme. Subsequently, the gRNA oligonucleotides were annealed and cloned into the <italic>BsaI</italic>-digested pDR274 vector. Next, <italic>DraI</italic>-digested gRNA expression vectors, purified via ethanol precipitation followed by PureLink PCR purification kit (Invitrogen), were transcribed and purified using HiScribe T7 High Yield Transcription Kit (New England BioLabs) and illustra Microspin G-50 Columns (GE Healthcare Life Sciences), respectively. Cas9 recombinant protein with nuclear localization signal (260 ng/μl; PNA Bio, USA) was co-injected with the gRNA (140ng/µl) into <italic>Nematostella</italic> zygotes.

<title>CRISPR/Cas9 mediated mutagenesis screening</title>
<p>To evaluate genome editing efficiency and mosaicism in F0 animals, genomic DNA flanking the guide sequence was amplified and Sanger sequenced. PCR was performed using two strategies. For the first, PCR reactions were performed using individual injected <italic>Nematostella</italic> (7-days post-fertilization), directly pipetted into a 25-μl PCR reaction containing a 2x concentration of PCR MasterMix (Tiangen) and 10 pmol of each PCR primer. For the second, genomic DNA was extracted from tissue sampling from live adult animals, after relaxation in 7% MgClphy<sub>2</sub> (Sigma-Aldrich), using NucleoSpin Tissue DNA purification kit (MACHERY-NAGEL). Subsequent PCR reactions were performed as above using 50-ng of genomic DNA. The primers used for these reactions (listed below) were designed to amplify a ∼750bp region around the targeted <italic>NvClk</italic> genomic locus. Mosaicism was determined if sequenced PCR products showed overlapping peaks in their chromatograms. The second strategy, which takes advantage of the ability of <italic>Nematostella</italic> to fully regenerate within a few days<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup>, is the one we refer to in the text hereafter. The injected individuals determined mosaic mutants were raised as F0 founders to sexual maturity and outcrossed with wild-type animals. The progeny of these crosses was raised and individually genotyped as described above. To determine inheritable mutations, sequences were further analyzed using the Tracking of Indels by DEcomposition web-tool (TIDE). TIDE quantifies editing efficiency and identifies the predominant types of DNA insertions and deletions (indel) mutation composition from a heterogeneous PCR product compared to a wild-type sequence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup>. Different heterozygous mutants were raised to sexual maturity and outcrossed with wild-type animals. The resulting F2 progenies were then raised to sexual maturity and genotyped before spawning for F3. Heterozygous mutants from each F2 progeny were intercrossed to obtain 25% homozygous F3 mutants. All animals used in this study are derived from heterozygous F2 mutants intercrosses, harboring the mutant allele <italic>NvClk<sup>Δ</sup></italic>. PCR genotyping was performed using the following primer:</p>

<title>Determination <italic>of NvClk<sup>Δ</sup> F3</italic> mutant genotypes</title>
<p>Genomic DNA was extracted as described above and used for following PCR and electrophoresis-based genotyping. PCR primers (listed below) encompassing the <italic>NvClk</italic> targeted site were used to produce PCR products of approximately 100 bp. The PCR products were then loaded and migrated by electrophoresis on a 3% Tris-borate-EDTA (TBE) agarose gel supplemented with GelStar Nucleic Acid Gel Stain (Lonza) for approximately one hour. The genotype of each F3 animal was determined by visualizing differences in migration speed of the PCR products caused by the CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing. The homozygous mutant animal (<italic>NvClk<sup>Δ/Δ</sup></italic>) produces only the larger ∼120 bp amplicon while the wild-type animal (<italic>NvClk<sup>+/+</sup></italic>) produces only the lower ∼100 bp amplicon. Animals heterozygous for the deletion (<italic>NvClk<sup>+/Δ</sup></italic>) produce both the larger mutant and the smaller wild-type amplicons. PCR genotyping was confirmed by subsequent DNA sequencing of selected F3 animals.</p>

<p>Locomotor activity of individual <italic>Nematostella</italic> were monitored using a lab-made setup equipped with an IP Infra-Red camera (Dahua Technology, Hangzhou, China), a white neon illumination (Aquastart8, Sylvania Lightning Solution,) and constantly illuminated with low-intensity infrared (850nm) LED light. The camera output 1h mp4 movie files which were AVI converted then stitched. The data collection and analysis were carried out by EthoVision XT8 video tracking software (Noldus information technology, Wageningen, Netherlands). Animals were isolated in wells of six-well plates, each of which was manually defined as a tracking ‘arena’ in the EthoVision software. Center-point detection with gray scaling (detection range of 25–77, contour erosion of 1-pixel, high pixel smoothing) was used to monitor movements, which were calculated according to the change in position of the average center pixel each second.</p>
<p>Illumination was provided with an intensity of 17 PPFD (+/−2) and did not significantly affect the experimental temperature (20 °C). The illumination cycles were 12: 12 h Light-Dark, 6: 6h Light-Dark or continuous light (LL).

<title>RNA extraction, library preparation, and sequencing</title>
<p>Total RNA was extracted from all sampled polyps (n = 96) using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). Purified RNA samples were analyzed using a NanoDrop 1000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) to assess RNA quantity and 2200 TapeStation (Agilent) to assess RNA quality (RNA integrity number, &gt;8.5). From each of the 96 samples (4 biological replicates in LD and 3 in DD, with the highest-quality extracts × 4 experimental subgroups × 7 time points, 1.5 μg of RNA was sent for library preparation (INCPM mRNAseq protocol) and sequencing at the Weizmann Institute Sequencing Unit, Israel. The libraries were sequenced using the bulk MARS-seq protocol (Jaitin et al.

<title>Rhythmicity analysis</title>
<p>Rhythmicity in transcript expression was assessed using the RAIN (ref-23) and metacycle (Wu et al., 2016) packages in R. The RAIN and JTK algorithms from metacycle were run separately for each Nematostella genotype in both light conditions (LD and D D), treating them as individual datasets. All replicates (n=3) for each time point within a dataset were analyzed as regular time series to identify transcripts exhibiting daily oscillations. Specifically, we focused on transcripts with a precise 24-hour period, excluding those with a range (e.g., 10 to 14 or 20 to 28 hours). To improve the accuracy of identifying true rhythmic genes, only transcripts with a P value &lt; 0.01 in both RAIN and JTK analyses were deemed confidently cycling transcripts. Genes identified as significant cycling genes were subsequently utilized as input for the DPGP_cluster program (McDowell et al., 2018), which clusters genes based on their expression trajectories. Gene clusters comprising 10 or more genes underwent testing for GO term enrichment. Heatmaps were generated using the heatmap package (v4.5.5) in R. Venn diagrams were generated using the web tool Venn diagram (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://bioinformatics.psbugent.be/webtools/Venn/">http://bioinformatics.psbugent.be/webtools/Venn/</ext-link>) And redraw with Inkscape.

<p>After obtaining the differential gene expression results, Gene Ontology (GO) analysis was performed using the R TopGO package (v2.50.0).This analysis aimed to identify significantly enriched biological processes, cellular components, and molecular functions among the differentially expressed genes. The file “nveGenes.vienna130208.GO_annotation_141017.txt” was utilized for GO analysis, and it was obtained from the following source: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Nematostella_vectensis_transcriptome_and_gene_models_v2_0/807696">https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Nematostella_vectensis_transcriptome_and_gene_models_v2_0/807696</ext-link>.

For HCR on <italic>Nematostella</italic> juvenile, several alterations were made to a previously described protocol<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>. Briefly, polyps were plucked and fixed in 4% PFA overnight at 4°C. Polyps were washed 3× in 1× PBS and then dehydrated and permeabilized with 2×5 min washes in 100% methanol. The samples were stored at –20°C overnight. To rehydrate the samples, a series of graded MeOH/PBST washes were used for 5 min each: 75% MeOH:25% 1× PBST, 50% MeOH:50% 1× PBST, 25% MeOH:75% 1× PBST, and finally 2× washes in 100% 1× PBST. To further permeabilize the polyps, samples were incubated in 10 μg/ml Proteinase K diluted in 1× PBST for 10 min. Samples were quickly washed 3× in 1× PBST, and then post-fixed with 4% PFA for 10 min. After post-fixation, samples underwent 3×5 min washes with 1× 2xSSC+0.1% Triton. From now, the following solutions (Pre-hybridization, hybridization and probe wash buffers) were lab-made from the cnidarian-adapted hybridization buffer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></sup>. Samples were then pre-hybridized with pre-hybridization buffer at 37°C for 30 min. After pre-hybridization, samples were incubated with 2 pmol of the probe set diluted in hybridization buffer for 16 hr at 37°C. To remove the probe mixture solution, samples were washed 2× for 30 min each with probe wash buffer at 37°C. Samples were washed 2× for 5 min with 5× SSC +0.1% Triton and then treated with probe amplification buffer for 30 min at room temperature. Samples were washed into hairpin amplification buffer containing snap cooled amplifier hairpins and were incubated at room temperature, protected from light, overnight. Samples were then washed with successive 3× 5xSSC +0.1% Triton washes: 2× washes for 15min. Nuclear staining was performed using DAPI 1:1000 in PBST during 1h.

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>Aguillon and collaborators have deeply revised, and in the progress significantly improved the presentation of their interesting results with the first Cnidarian circadian gene mutant. Results are now very convincingly demonstrating that CLK is required for free-running behavioral rhythms under constant conditions. The results also now more convincingly show that CLK impact rhythmic gene expression, although interpretation of the transcriptomics data is not straightforward. I think there is still improvements that are needed to make the manuscript more accessible. We authors need to keep in mind that a broad audience will read their report, not just chronobiologists. I have listed below several issues that I think should be addressed, and some editing suggestions.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>General comment to Editor and Reviewers:</p>
<p>We are genuinely grateful to both reviewers and editors about all the feedback which helped us to make the best of our data, to question our analysis to the point we redefined our approach and end up with a great article we are proud of it. Only the name of authors is visible on the article, and considering how much the reviewing system help to improve the research it seems almost unfair. As such, we thank all of you and really appreciate the new eLife system. Bravo all.</p>

<p>(3) Line 46 and throughout the manuscript, the allelic nomenclature is not standard. 1-/- seems to indicate there are two different alleles. Since the allele might not be a null, I would suggest simply using 1/1, or perhaps delta/delta since the mutation results in a truncates CLK.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>NvClk1-/-  became  NvClkΔ/Δ. Except in the .xls supplementary table were the mutant kept the NvClk-/- nomenclature. It is not possible to replace only part of a word with a different font, here generating delta sign would require to do it one by one.</p>

<p>(4) The last sentence of the abstract needs to be rephrased, as it suggests that CLK evolved to maintain circadian rhythms under constant conditions. Constant conditions very rarely exist on Earth, and thus cannot be an evolutionary driving force. Different explanations have been proposed on why a self-sustained clock is the evolutionary solution to timekeeping, but the purpose of the clock and of clock genes is not to maintain oscillations in constant conditions. Actually, this sentence conflicts with the title.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Modified to: the Clock gene has evolved in cnidarians to sustain 24-hour rhythmic physiology and behavior in absence of diel environmental conditions.
From my actual understanding, you are right, the purpose of clock gene is not to maintain oscillation in constant conditions (this is simply the result of the experiment), but to synchronize the physiology to the day/night rhythm, and surely to sustain 24h oscillations in case the environment challenges the perception of the diel cues. The DD or LL is just an artificial experimental design to reveal the endogenous time-keeping pacemaker.</p>

<p>We modified the paragraph accordingly: The presence of a 24-hour rhythm of NvClkΔ/Δ polyps under LD conditions could be attributed to either a direct light-response or the partial functioning of the circadian clock due to the nature of the mutation….</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) At the end of the behavior section, or perhaps at the end of each paragraph in this section, it would be helpful to have a summary of the results and more clearly explain their interpretation. The authors need to guide the readers, particularly non-chronobiologist, so that they can understand what the really neat data that were obtained mean. For example, what does it mean that the acrophase is different between mutant and wild-type, why are Clk mutants rhythmic under LD12/12 or 6/6, etc.</p>

<p>(5) Paragraph starting with line 184: I do not follow what is important about the number of genes per time cluster. What does it tell us, beyond the simple fact that less genes are rhythmic in the Clk mutants?</p>

<p>Discussion:</p>
<p>(1) Line 236-40. Careful with the use of -/-, which implies that an allele is a null. The first CLk mutants in mammals and flies, which the authors refer to. were actually dominant negatives.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>I went over the citations we used for this paragraph and this first mutation in fly dClkar is null, no dominant negative. Flies are still rhythmic in the dark. Unless there is an older mutation? However, you right the first mutation identified in mouse was a dominant-negative with loss of rhythmicity, while the gene deletion did not show any effect on the behavior, suggesting compensation by a paralog. I removed two references which were not relevant to the discussion.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) Line 265-268 are not very clear. Do the authors mean that the lack of overlap for non-cricadian pacemaker genes is because of different experimental conditions? What would be those differences? It is reassuring that the Leach/Reitzel study and the present share pacemaker genes as rhythmic, but it is also surprising that there is almost no overlap beyond these genes. How robust are those other rhythms compared to circadian clock genes?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We revised this paragraph and raised major points regarding the raising condition of our polyps between labs and their potential genetic differences which could explain these differences.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) Line 270. I am not sure &quot;compensation&quot; is the right word, since there is no overlap between the rhythmic genes in mutants under LD and wild-type under either LD or DD. Also, saying on line 273 that the transcriptional pattern is not fully reproduced is a rather striking understatement, given the absence of rhythm gene overlap</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We rewrote the paragraph accordingly. We replaced by “alternative way to drive rhythmicity under LD condition”.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) Line 279. The authors mention the possibility of false positives. Based on the FDR, is there more rhythmic genes than by chance?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The possibility of false-positive is a risk to consider when you do not perform multiple-testing. We added within the results paragraph the number of rhythmic genes identified with BH.Q or p.adj. which both are the multiple testing for each algorithm (RAIN and JTK) we used.</p>

<p>(5) Line 279-82. The references to the Ray study is rather obscure. What is the point the authors are trying to make here?</p>

<p>(7) The way Lines 283-288 are worded do not provide a good rationale for how transcriptional rhythms were analyzed. The idea to combine two different approaches (JTK and RAIN) to be selective with rhythmicity was great. The authors need however to justify these choices in a more convincing manner. The goal is to detect rhythmic genes in a reliable manner, irrespective of the number of rhythmic genes observed Also, explaining the choice of methodology belongs to the result section.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We explained our choice of methodology and moved it to the result section as suggested.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(8) Line 292-3. There are known mechanisms that explain how transcriptional time clusters are generated. In particular, the use of interlocked feedback loop with antiphase peaks of transcriptions is well documented. Actually, it seems to me the clustering shown in Fig 4 might hint at such a mechanism.</p>

<p>Indeed you are right the clustering shown in Fig 3 (former Fig 4) revealed such mechanism.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>We decided to modify this figure as we realized it was not informative and not objective enough, as we selected among multiple patterns few “representatives”. In the new figure we combined the cluster analysis to the behavior. Thus, readers can now pick a cluster according to a specific behavior activity level (or ZT/CT) and reach in supp. Table 4 the “genes of potential interest”. However generally speaking this figure does not explain more the consequences of the mutation, so we moved it into the Extended data Fig.2</p>
