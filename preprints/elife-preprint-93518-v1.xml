<title>Abstract</title>
<p>The Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER), the largest cellular compartment, harbours the machinery for the biogenesis of secretory proteins, lipids, calcium storage/mobilisation and detoxification. It is shaped as layered membranous sheets interconnected with a network of tubules extending throughout the cell. Understanding the influence of the ER morphology dynamics on molecular transport may offer clues to rationalising neuro-pathologies caused by ER morphogen mutations. It remains unclear, however, how the ER facilitates its intra-luminal mobility and homogenises its content, and the minuscule spatial and temporal scales relevant to the ER nanofluidics limit empirical studies. To surmount this barrier, here we exploit the principles of viscous fluid dynamics to generate a theoretical physical model emulating in-silico the content motion in actively contracting nanoscopic tubular networks. The computational model reveals the luminal particle speeds, and their impact in facilitating active transport, of the active contractile behaviour of the different ER components along various time-space parameters. The results of the model indicate that reproducing transport with velocities similar to those reported experimentally in single particle tracking would require unrealistically high values of tubule contraction site length and rate. Considering further nanofluidic scenarios, we show that width contractions of the ER’s flat domains (perinuclear sheets) generate fast-decaying flows with only a short-range effect on luminal transport. Only contraction of peripheral sheets can reproduce experimental measurements, provided they are able to contract fast enough.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The mammalian endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is the single largest intracellular structure (see sketch in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>). The organelle is made up of membranous sheets interconnected with the nuclear envelope and branching out into a planar network of tubules extending throughout the cell periphery (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>]. The ER dynamics on a second scale include the cytoskeleton-assisted tubular network restructuring [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>] and an interconversion between two distinct forms, including a narrower form covered by membrane curvature-promoting proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>]. The ER morphology and its dynamics presumably enable and facilitate its functions: the ER is responsible for the production, maturation and quality-controlled folding of secretory and membrane proteins, which constitute approximately a third of the cell’s proteome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>]. The organelle’s membranes also harbour the lipid biosynthesis machinery, while its lumen stores calcium. The contiguous nature of the ER is believed to ensure an efficient delivery of all these components across the cell periphery.</p>

<p>Timely transport of the content within the ER is therefore integral to the function of the cell. The geometry and dimensions of several cell types with extensive ER-containing projections (e.g. neurons and strocytes) pose a kinetic challenge for material distribution with physiological timing. These considerations predict the need for an active luminal transport to ensure timely material homogenisation across the vast ER. Empirically, the active nature of the ER luminal transport is supported by the sensitivity of GFP mobility (measured by FRAP) to ATP depletion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>]. Thus past measurements indicate that the transport of proteins in ER is not consistent with Brownian motion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>]. Using single particle tracking of ER luminal markers, an active solute transport in the planar ER network was observed directly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>]. A photoactivation chase technique also measured a superdiffusive behaviour of luminal material spread through the ER network [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>].</p>
<p>However, the mechanism for generating ER luminal flows remains unclear. Understanding the mode of material exchange across the organelle is crucial for rationalising the ER shaping defects-related neuronal pathologies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>], identifying factors controlling ER transport and informing the development of ER transport modulation approaches with health benefits. Based on ER marker velocity fluctuations measured in single particle tracking and the detection of transient narrowing points in the tubules by improved super-resolution and electron microscopy (EM) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>], it has been postulated that these active flows may result from the stochastic contractility (pinching and un-pinching) of ER tubules at specific locations along their lengths (see sketch in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1e</xref>); other plausible mechanisms for flow generation were also considered. However, measurements for testing this pinching hypothesis are currently inaccessible, due to limitations in space-time resolution of live cell microscopy; the live cell-compatible super-resolution techniques achieve resolution of <italic>∼</italic>80 nm at the relevant speed, while the tubular radius is estimated in the range 30<italic>−</italic>60 nm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>]. Improvement or resolution currently can only be achieved by trading off speed. To circumvent these experimental difficulties, in the current study we use mathematical modelling to quantitatively analyse the relevant scenarios of actively contractility-driven flows. Specifically, we explore how various sets of spatio-temporal parameters of ER contractility may produce flows facilitating solute transport in quantitative agreement with experimental measurements.</p>
<p>Specifically, assuming that the flow is driven by tubule contractions (shown schematically in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1e</xref>), we construct a physical and mathematical model of the ER network and solve it for the flows inside the network (description in Methods §IV). We use our model to carry out numerical simulations to study the motion of Brownian particles carried by these flows and show that the tubule pinching hypothesis is not supported by the results of our model (§II A), a result independent of the network geometry (§II B). The failure of active pinching to drive strong flows can be rationalised theoretically by deriving a rigorous upper-bound on the rate of transport induced by a single pinch, (§II C), including possible coordination mechanisms (§II D). Only by increasing both the length of pinches and their rate can beyond admissible values can we produce particle speeds in agreement with measurements (§II E). We then explore in §II F two different hypotheses as possible explanations for the active ER flows, first the pinching of the junctions between tubules (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>) and then the pinching of the two types of ER sheets, perinuclear (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1f</xref>) and peripheral (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d</xref>). We investigate the conditions under which both would be consistent with the experimental measurements of active transport in Ref. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>].</p>
<p>The question of how the endoplasmic reticulum homogenises its content across cell expanses is an open problem which extends to the fundamentals of cell biology. Even though it is highly debated in the field, it is extremely difficult to study due to the enormous technical limits of directly observing intraorganellar nanofluidics. Thus, our study represents a meaningful effort to break through this impasse by conducting a meticulous analysis of nanofluidic scenarios. The findings we present constitute the best currently possible endeavor to shed light on this challenging problem. Our results do suggest that the biological origin of solute transport in ER networks remains open and call for extensive empirical exploration of the alternative mechanisms for flow generation.</p>

<title>Tubule contractility-driven ER luminal motion yields inadequate transport kinetics</title>
<p>To assess the kinetics of particle motion in the lumen of tubular structures in response to their contractility, we generated an in-silico simulation model of the process. The model incorporates local calculations for the low-Reynolds number hydrodynamics of a contracting tubule, assuming in the first instance the no-slip boundary conditions at the tubule walls (i.e. Poiseuille hydrodynamics), into a global analysis using Kirchhoff’s Laws and standard graph theoretical results of the flows throughout the network geometry (see Methods §IV for details).</p>
<p>We initially implemented the model’s numerical simulations of particle transport in a reconstructed ER network of a COS-7 cell [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>] (which we label C0, see §IV A) with tubules locally contracting stochastically according to the spatiotemporal parameters suggested by microscopy measurements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>]. We will therein refer to these contractions, illustrated in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1e</xref>, as ‘pinching’, with relevant parameters that include the duration and frequency of pinch events, and the length that the pinch sites occupy along the tubule (for details of the pinching kinematics, see Methods §IV B). An estimate reveals that these pinches are indeed afforded by biologically realistic forces, of the order of 30 pN (see Methods §IV G).</p>
<p>The fluid flows in the edges of the network (model in §IV C computed as detailed in §IV D) reveal a rapid direction alternation of luminal currents (on average with a frequency of approximately 50 Hz), as reflected in the changes of the axial velocity sign (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>), with an average flow speed of 1.3 μm/s (see also Supplementary Video S1). Further, the resulting instantaneous speed distribution of Brownian particles advected by these flows (methodology in §IV E) is considerably shifted relative to the experimental counterpart [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>] towards lower values (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref>). Similarly, the distribution of average edge traversal speeds (defined precisely in §IV F) from our simulations (solid blue line in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref>) is lower than the experimentally measured speed distribution by an order of magnitude (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref>, inset).</p>

<p>Moreover, the results for all measures of transport under pure diffusion, in the absence of pinching-induced flows, were virtually indistinguishable from those where the pinchingdriven flows are included (see <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b-c</xref>). Within the framework of transport theory, this conclusion can be rationalised by estimating the relevant Péclet numbers that measure the relative importance of advection and diffusion. Using the average value Ū <italic>∼</italic> 1.3 μm/s of the mean flow speeds over time and edges as a velocity scale, we may estimate a mean Péclet number as Pe <italic>∼ Ū R/D</italic>. Using <italic>R</italic> = 30 nm and the measured diffusivity <italic>D ≈</italic> 0.6 μm<sup>2</sup>s<sup><italic>−</italic>1</sup> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>], this leads to the estimate Pe <italic>∼</italic> 0.07. Flows affect transport for Péclet numbers above order-one values [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>], and therefore the pinching-driven flows have a negligible influence on the transport inside the ER network. In order for fluid motion to have a noticeable effect, one would thus need flows to be either stronger, or sustained in one direction for longer. The chaotic flows produced by the pinching events with stochastic parameters suggested by resolution-limited microscopy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>] appear too weak to generate fast, non-diffusive edge traversals.</p>
<p>Importantly, our conclusions remain unchanged upon relaxing the no-slip boundary conditions, an important point to consider since the tubule membranes themselves could be moving in response to the nanoscale fluid flow. This can be modelled by introducing a finite slip boundary condition to couple the membrane-bound lipids with luminal flows (see Methods §IV G for details). Our simulations show that slip boundary conditions have virtually no effect on the average edge traversal speeds (Supplementary Fig. 12a). Physically, while a non-zero wall slip does change the shape of the flow profiles in the tubules (Supplementary Fig. 12b), it does not modify the mean flow speeds which directly affect global particle transport. These results justify our use of Poiseuille hydrodynamics (no-slip boundary conditions) throughout this work.</p>

<title>Tubule pinching-induced transport is network geometry independent and fails to facilitate luminal homogenisation</title>
<p>To estimate the network geometry’s contribution to transport simulation outcomes, we compared results across four different ER structures (C1-C4, Fig. S8). The distributions of the average edge traversal speeds appeared insensitive to ER structure variations for both pinching-induced and exclusively diffusional transport. This is reflected in the small deviations from the mean of the data points averaged across the different structures (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2de</xref>). Further, pinching-induced flows inside a regular honeycomb network (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2f</xref>, inset) with a typical ER edge length (1 μm) appears within a reasonable variance compared to the natural networks. Therefore, this mathematical idealisation of the ER network geometry can be used for exploring the consequences of the network ultrastructure contractility on transport kinetics in a standardised manner.</p>
<p>To test the effectiveness of the particle velocities for facilitating luminal material exchange across the ER, we tracked homogenisation kinetics by measuring intermixing of particles of two distinct colours equally seeded in each half of a honeycomb network at <italic>t</italic> = 0 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>; see also Supplementary Video S2 for the flows inside such a network driven by pinches with the parameters from [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>]). The measure of homogenisation is given by the variance Var(<italic>ϕ</italic>(<italic>t</italic>)) ≡ Var(<italic>n</italic><sub><italic>b</italic></sub>(<italic>t</italic>) <italic>− n</italic><sub><italic>r</italic></sub>(<italic>t</italic>)) over twenty regions of the network (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>, horizontal lines) of the difference between the numbers <italic>n</italic><sub><italic>b</italic></sub> (blue) and <italic>n</italic><sub><italic>r</italic></sub> (red) of particles of each colour in region; note Var = 0 represents perfect homogeneity. The measures of mixing over time for pure diffusion and active transport with parameters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>] from <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> show a nearly complete overlap (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3e</xref>; see also Supplementary Videos S3 and S4), distinct from faster mixing under stronger flows in a network driven by pinches whose lengths are increased to their maximum possible value (i.e. the length of the tubule) and which are in addition sped up by a factor of 10 (see Supplementary Video S5; see also §II E for a discussion of the effects of artificially strong pinch parameters on average edge traversal speeds). This indicates that even if the experimental particle speeds were overestimated, the presumed pinching parameters would be inadequate to facilitate ER luminal material exchange.</p>

<title>Theoretical analysis of advection due to a single pinch explains weak pinchinginduced transport</title>
<p>The slow luminal transport driven by the pinching-induced flows is intrinsically linked to the volume of fluid expelled by each pinch during a contraction. The fundamental reason underlying the weak pinching-induced transport is that individual pinches are very weak generator of flow; even in the best possible configuration, the volumes of fluid pushed by each pinch are too small to impact luminal transport. Specifically, in Methods (§IV J 1), we mathematically show that, given a pinch of length 2<italic>L</italic>, the maximum distance Δ<italic>z</italic><sub>max</sub> a suspended particle may be advected instantaneously by an individual pinch is
<disp-formula id="eqn1">
<graphic xlink:href="523552v2_eqn1.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
Using the experimentally-measured average value of the pinch length 2<italic>L</italic> = 0.14 μm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>], a typical pinch can then propel a particle by a maximum distance of Δ<italic>z</italic><sub>max</sub> <italic>≈</italic> 0.19 μm.</p>
<p>This may, equivalently, be framed in terms of velocities. A transported particle experiences an average velocity during the contraction of at most <italic>V</italic><sub>max</sub> = 8<italic>L/</italic>3<italic>T</italic>, where <italic>T</italic> is the duration of a contraction or a relaxation. Using the pinch length as above and the average values of 2<italic>T</italic> = 0.213 s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>] this leads to the estimate <italic>V</italic><sub>max</sub> <italic>≈</italic> 3.9 μm/s, which is an order of magnitude smaller than the measured typical edge traversal speed of <italic>∼</italic> 45 μm/s, consistent with the order of magnitude difference between the measurements and the predictions of the computational model.</p>
<p>Note that this theoretical argument relies solely on the magnitude of fluid volumes expelled out of (or driven into) the pinching regions. These volumes are unaffected by the boundary conditions at the tubule walls because the presence of a non-zero slip length only changes the shape of the flow profile and not the volume fluxes (see Supplementary Fig. 12); any potential slip is thus is inconsequential for averaged measures of particle transport.</p>

<title>Marginal addition of coordinated contractility to luminal transport</title>
<p>The theoretical upper bound in the previous section for the maximum luminal transport produceable by an individual pinch is realisable only in the hypothetical situation where the flow generated by the pinch is all directed to one end of the tubule i.e. when the other end is effectively blocked. However, content transport produced during the contraction of a single tubule would then be reversed when the tubule relaxes back to its original state, with a single pinch site expected to exhibit only reciprocal (i.e. time-reversible) motions. Any advection contributing to edge traversals must thus be dominated by non-reciprocal motions of multiple pinches resulting in net displacements of solute particles.</p>
<p>The simplest system capable of producing non-reciprocal motions consists of two pinches, and the optimal sequence of motions to maximise the resulting advective particle displacement is illustrated in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>. We show in Methods (§IV J 2) that this is indeed the optimal two-pinch coordination, which results in a time-averaged displacement equal to the upper bound derived in <xref rid="eqn1" ref-type="disp-formula">Eq. (1)</xref>. Since this optimal sequence of motions involves one pinch site starting a pinch halfway through the pinching of the other site, it is reasonable to estimate its duration as 3<italic>T</italic>, and therefore an average particle speed of 8<italic>L/</italic>9<italic>T ≈</italic> 1.3 μm/s. The low particle speed achievable by the optimal coordination between two pinches suggests that a very high level of coordination among multiple tens of pinches per tubule would be required to reproduce the measured edge traversals.</p>

<title>A combination of high frequency and pinch length is required to replicate experimental particle speeds</title>
<p>Since the magnitude of ER contractility suggested by microscopy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>] (pinch lengths and frequency) do not explain the measured speeds, we set out to explore different sets of parameters that may generate particle velocities closer to the experimental measurements. The currently achievable imaging spatiotemporal resolution limits the detection of tubular diameter contractility by microscopy. Therefore, it is reasonable to postulate that the relevant parameters may have been underestimated. We simulated ER transport varying individually or in combination the values of pinch duration 2<italic>T</italic>, waiting time <italic>T</italic><sub><italic>wait</italic></sub> between successive pinches on a tubule, and pinch length 2<italic>L</italic>.</p>
<p>We first decreased both the original [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>] values of <italic>T</italic> and <italic>T</italic><sub><italic>wait</italic></sub> by the same factor of 1<italic>/α</italic>, where <italic>α ≥</italic> 1, and simulated particle transport in the honeycomb network (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref>). In effect, this simply ‘fast-forwards’ the flows in the original active network by a factor of <italic>α</italic>, and Brownian particles of the original diffusivity are released into this sped-up flow. Instantaneous and edge traversal speeds exhibited corresponding increases when we increased the value of <italic>α</italic> (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref>). An extreme value of <italic>α</italic> = 100 produces an average edge traversal speed distribution that peaks at around 8 μm/s (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref>). Similar results are observed in the C0 network from a COS-7 cell (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b</xref>). The longer tails of these distributions (compared to those from the honeycomb network) result from the variation in edge lengths in the real network, with shorter edges, across which edge traversals are correspondingly fast, contributing to the tails.</p>
<p>These results suggest that, in order to produce average edge traversal speeds of the same order as the experimental values, we would need an active network sped up by a unrealistic factors considerably greater than 100, probably on the order of <italic>α ∼ 𝒪</italic>(10<sup>3</sup>) or higher and corresponding to multiple thousands of pinches occurring on average per second on each tubule. Similarly, it took an extreme increase in pinch site size to span the entire length of an average tubule, only to yield an average speed of <italic>∼</italic> 10 μm/s (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4d</xref>).</p>
<p>Next, we attempted to obtain a better fit to experimental data by combining changes in both the pinches’ time and geometry parameters. In <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4e-f</xref> we thus sped up these maximally long pinches by a factor of <italic>α</italic> = 5 and 10 respectively, which yielded speeds averaging around 30 μm/s and above 60 μm/s respectively. Notably, the tail of the speeds distribution appeared longer than that seen in the experiments.</p>

<title>Luminal transport kinetics derived from contractile ER tubular junctions and sheets</title>
<p>As shown above, establishing effective transport in a tubular constrictions-driven model based on realistic ER fluid dynamics required a set of questionable assumptions, compelling us to explore alternatives. Thus, we set out to investigate how ER luminal transport would be impacted by the contractility of its structural components with volumes larger than tubules: (i) the tubular junctions (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>), (ii) the perinuclear ER sheets (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1f</xref>) and (iii) the peripheral sheets (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d</xref>).</p>
<p>First, we run numerical simulations of transport driven by contracting junctions on an ER network (C1 from Fig. S8d; sketch of junctions in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>). Since junctions contracting at the tubular pinch temporal parameters measured experimentally yielded inadequate transport, we consider contractions/relaxations with duration 2<italic>T</italic> exponentially distributed with a mean of <italic>α</italic><sup><italic>−</italic>1</sup> times the original value in Ref. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>] and the waiting time <italic>T</italic><sub><italic>wait</italic></sub> between subsequent contractions/relaxations exponentially distributed with a mean <italic>β</italic><sup><italic>−</italic>1</sup> times the original value (i.e. values of <italic>α &gt;</italic> 1 and <italic>β &gt;</italic> 1 reflecting a higher frequency and faster pinches). Naturally, the results depend on the choice of the volume Δ<italic>V</italic> expelled by a junction during each contraction. Using fluorescence microscopy images, we may estimate the volume in junctions (see Methods, § IV I 1). We assumed that the junction volumes are drawn from a normal distribution with the same mean and standard deviation as our data set i.e. the distribution N(0.0045 μm<sup>3</sup>, 0.0021 μm<sup>3</sup>). Volumes greater than the maximum value in our experimental estimate (0.0081 μm<sup>3</sup>) or less than the minimum value (0.0020 μm<sup>3</sup>) are rejected.</p>
<p>We show the results in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6a</xref>. The thick solid line illustrates a set of values of (<italic>α, β</italic>) which produces distributions of average edge traversal speeds with means similar to the experimental values in Ref. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>], and the dashed lines one standard deviation away. We are interested in values of (<italic>α, β</italic>) close to unity because this corresponds to junctions which pinch with similar pinch durations and frequencies as the experimentally observed tubule pinches and are therefore biologically plausible; (<italic>α, β</italic>) <italic>≈</italic> (2.5,2) is the closest pair on this line to unity. However, only for <italic>α ≈</italic> 1 we obtained average edge traversal speed distributions of reasonable shapes (i.e. approximately Gaussian), which would require a large <italic>β</italic> = 5 to match experimental results quantitatively.</p>

</fig>
<p>Further, the assumption that the entire junction volume is expelled during a contraction may not be realistic, as it would require extreme bending/extension of tubule walls and the ability of the entire junction to empty and fill out during each contraction. Reducing the volume Δ<italic>V</italic> expelled in each contraction to two-thirds of the estimated distribution of the junction’s volume (results shown in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6b</xref>) or to half (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6c</xref>) causes the average edge traversal speeds to drop considerably. The lower the proportion of the junction volume expelled during a contraction, the faster the pinches are required to be (i.e. large value of <italic>α</italic>) as well as the larger the frequencies of the pinch events (large <italic>β</italic>) in order to produce reasonably high average edge traversal speeds.</p>
<p>Next, we considered the particle transport generated by two types of ER sheets contracting and relaxing over a duration 2<italic>T</italic> (see Methods for details). The perinuclear sheets are shaped as contiguous layers of flat cisternae with a luminal volume larger than the tubules branching from these structures (see sketch in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1f</xref>). Accordingly, their contraction with 2<italic>T</italic> = 5 s and <italic>V</italic><sub><italic>sheet</italic></sub> = 10 μm<sup>3</sup> yielded a mean average traversal speed of 35 μm/s and consistent with the single particle tracking experiments (see <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7b</xref>). However, the speeds distributions tailed towards higher values (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7a-b</xref>), something that has not be observed experimentally so far; it may be that high velocities cannot be recovered in experiments due to the constraints on linkage distance imposed to ensure trajectory fidelity in particle tracking.</p>

</fig>
<p>Further, our simulations reveal that the flow decays sharply with distance away from the sheet where it originated as it branches out into tubules. This is illustrated in <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7c-d</xref> and we further quantify the spatial gradient of the average edge traversal speeds across Cartesian 2D coordinates in <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7e</xref>, revealing the stark contrast between the homogeneous profile for contracting junctions (red dotted line) vs sheet-driven transport (blue solid line). The short range of influence afforded by contracting perinuclear ER sheets thus argues against its ability to sustain mixing flows and fast particle transport on the distal tubular network.</p>
<p>Instead, we sought to explore whether the the peripheral sheets (i.e. the smaller flat intertubular ER regions, see sketch in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d</xref>) may overcome the range limit. The peripheral sheets have volume significantly larger than tubules and junctions, which we estimated at 0.12μm<sup>3</sup> <italic>±</italic> 0.04 μm<sup>3</sup> (see Fig. S14 and Methods §IV I 4 for details). This suggests that the peripheral sheets could produce average edge traversal speeds compatible with experimental measurements. Assuming that a sheet typically occupies the area enclosed by a ‘triangle’ of tubules, we may incorporate the transport inside a sheet-driven network using our model for junctions-contraction, but with junction volumes set to the measured sheet volumes (see §IV I 4 for details) and with either (i) each node expelling one third of the volume expelled by a contracting sheet (since peripheral sheet are in contact with three nodes on average), or (ii) a contracting node expelling the entire volume expelled by a contracting sheet, but with only one-third of the junctions actively contracting at any one time. Further assuming that during each contraction an peripheral sheet expels half its total volume so that in simulation (i) node <italic>k</italic> expels a volume <italic>V</italic><sub><italic>k</italic></sub><italic>/</italic>6 in each contraction and in simulation (ii) each active node <italic>k</italic> expels a volume <italic>V</italic><sub><italic>k</italic></sub><italic>/</italic>3, nodes which contract at rates <italic>α</italic><sup><italic>−</italic>1</sup> = 2.5 and <italic>α</italic><sup><italic>−</italic>1</sup> = 5 times slower than the tubule pinches in Ref. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>] in simulations (i) and (ii) respectively give average edge traversal speeds in the correct range of 40 μm/s (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7f-g</xref>). The contraction of peripheral sheets may thus be offered as a plausible mechanism for fast luminal transport, provided they are able to contract with sufficiently high rates.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The motion of solutes in cellular compartments is now understood to be facilitated by active components. This is evident from direct motion measurements and the dependence of motion speed on the availability of ATP-contained energy [6–8, 14]. The origin of these active driving forces is however challenging to identify. The cytoplasm’s currents are often believed to originate from the motion of large complexes such as ribosomes and large vesicle cargo shuttled by the cytoskeleton-mediated motorised transport [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>]. In the case of enhanced transport in the lumen of the ER tubules, the contractility of tubules has been suggested as the flow generating mechanism, and indeed such tubule deformations have been observed in microscopy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>]. However, establishing the direct empirical link between tubule contraction and active flows, or experimentally testing other hypotheses for the driving mechanism behind ER solute transport, remain currently unattainable. In this study, we thus propose a physical modelling approach, which provides a platform to explore the nanofluidics behaviour of biological systems such as the ER network. The outcomes of our simulations for a contractile ER argue against the plausibility of local pinch-driven flow; pinches with frequency and size on the order of those estimated by microscopy yield significantly lower speeds than single particle tracking measurements, as well as no enhancement of mixing beyond that from passive diffusion. The deficit stems from the fact that the displaced fluid volume upon local contraction is too small to generate sufficient particle transport.</p>
<p>Given the uncertainty of the empirical measurements for ER tubule deformation, due to the limits in the spatio-temporal resolution of organelle structure imaging, the pinch parameters may have been significantly underestimated. This sanctioned exploring a wider range of spatio-temporal parameters in our simulations, which revealed that a combination of a higher frequency with a much larger pinch length may provide higher particle speeds that are comparable to the single particle tracking measurements. Further, our modelling results suggest the possibility of transport by luminal width contractions of larger volume ER subdomains (which are contiguously interconnected with the network). In that respect, the contraction of peripheral (i.e. inter-tubular) sheets, in particular yielded speed values in a plausible range provided they are able to contrast fast enough. In contrast, the contraction of a large-volume perinuclear sheets led to fast transport but with a limited spatial range and with flows that would not impact transport beyond a few microns into the peripheral network. Similarly, the alternative scenario of tubular junctions’ contractility appears unlikely as particle speeds similar to experiments could only appears for junctions pinching at up to 8 times faster than experimentally observed contracting tubules.</p>
<p>The modelling approach in this study, although focused on the ER network, provides a step forward towards understanding intra-organellar fluid dynamics. Our simulation results have been used to rule out several scenarios, which seemed physically intuitive but are nevertheless unable to explain the observed enhanced luminal transport. Furthermore, our results generated a set of potentially testable predictions that can be used to validate or refute each of the envisaged transport mechanisms. For example, as fluid expulsion from peripheral sheets appears to be in broad in agreement with single particle tracking measurements data under even conservative assumptions, future measurements may explore whether an active luminal motion is more pronounced and faster in proximity to peripheral sheets. Moreover, a set of improved spatio-temporal resolution measurements of particle tracking and structural contractions will be needed to complete the physical picture of ER luminal transport.</p>
<p>While our study allowed us to test different plausible scenarios, questions remain open as to the force-generation mechanisms responsible for the observed pinching dynamics. We have estimated in Sec. IV G that forces on the order of 30 pN would be required to periodically bend the tubules as seen empirically. The force exerted by a single molecular motor has been estimated to be on the order of 6 pN [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>], so the required forces for pinching may be provided by several motors working together [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>]. Recently discovered hydro-osmotic instabilities could also contribute to shape fluctuations and pinching, although they are predicted to have much longer wavelengths than the typical size of a pinching region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>]. In contrast, the mechanisms involving topological remodelling of the ER, such as the welldocumented process of ring closure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>], occur over timescales of minutes and therefore cannot account for the millisecond-scale transport measured here.</p>
<p>Although we have used in silico fluidics modeling for our conclusions, particularly in identifying new physically permitted mechanisms of luminal propulsion, our simulations should be regarded as theoretical predictions demonstrating physical plausibility rather than mere speculation. We have explored theoretically the consequences of structural fluctuations which presumably do take place. Fluctuations in width of the flat ER areas, in particular, are expected since the structures appear dynamic in live light microscopy and narrowing/extension points are observable in electron microscopy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>]. Further, variability in the areas of flat ER that are observable in electron microscopy can be explained by capturing the structures in different states of fluctuations. It should be expected that the mobile elastic structure such as ER sheets would not exhibit rigidity required to prohibit fluctuations.</p>
<p>In conclusion, it is worth emphasising that our in-silico fluid dynamical modelling reveals that for structural fluctuation-based mechanisms to facilitate luminal motion require assumptions currently not supported by empirical data. This warrants explorations of alternative mechanisms for ER luminal transport, for example anomalous diffusion driven by the fluctuations of macromolecular complexes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>] or by osmotic forces, as previously suggested [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>].</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<p>Here we describe the mathematical and physical model for the fluid mechanics and transport driven by active contractions in the ER. This requires the introduction of a network model for the geometry of the ER (§IV A) and individual pinches (§IV B) and a framework for the hydrodynamics of pinching tubules (§IV C). Our solution method for the flows inside our network is then described in §IV D. From simulations of Brownian particles advected by these flows (§IV E) quantitative measures of particle transport (§IV F) are extracted for comparison with experiment. Modifications of our model to explore alternative flow generation mechanisms are discussed in §IV I. Finally in §IV J we present in detail the derivations of the theoretical results discussed in §II C (transport upper bound by a single pinch) and §II D (coordination of pinches).</p>

<title>Network modelling</title>
<p>We represent the ‘skeleton’ of a two-dimensional ER network as a planar graph with each node assigned a position <bold>x</bold> <italic>∈</italic> R<sup>2</sup>. Given an edge of the network labelled (<italic>i, j</italic>) and of length |<bold>x</bold><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> <italic>−</italic> <bold>x</bold><sub><italic>j</italic></sub>| = <italic>l</italic>, we model the lumen of the corresponding tubule to occupy a cylinder of radius <italic>R</italic> whose axis lies along the edge and has length <italic>l</italic>. This assumption avoids the intrinsic difficulty in defining a precise boundary between a tubule and a tubular junction, as well as leading to a simplified model of the intra-nodal dynamics of a solute particle (see below); since the tubules are long compared to the size of the junctions, the impact of their small overlap can be safely neglected.</p>
<p>We mathematically reconstruct a model ER network, which we refer to as C0, using the skeleton image of the COS7 ER network given in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> of the Supplementary Material from Ref. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>]; this network is reproduced in <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8a</xref>. We use the multi-point tool in ImageJ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>] to place numbered points at the positions of the nodes on the source skeleton image, and then obtain a list of the indices and position coordinates of each node. The edges are then manually tabulated as a list of pairs of nodes; this gives us all the information required to construct a mathematical graph as shown in <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8b</xref>, with the original network superimposed on the mathematical model in <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8c</xref>. Note that in what follows we work with the largest connected component of the source skeleton image in order to study transport in a fully connected network. We also use the same procedure to extract the graph structures from microscopy images, of four smaller ER networks which we label C1-C4 (original network with mathematical graph superimposed in <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8d</xref>). In Supplementary Fig. 10, we show the distributions of the edge (tubule) lengths in each of the C0-C4 networks, as well as the mean edge lengths and the mean degrees (the degree of a node is the number of edges connected to it). The mean edge lengths are around 1 μm and mean degrees are approximately 3. In order to compare the biological network to an idealised ER system, we also consider below a honeycomb network, i.e. one where every node (apart from those at the boundaries) has a degree of 3, with all edge lengths exactly 1 μm.</p>

<title>Pinch modelling</title>
<p>To describe the pinches (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1e</xref>), we consider a model where the kinematics of each pinch is fully prescribed in time. We therefore assume that the active biochemical forces responsible for the deformation of the tubules balance with the elastic resistance of the tubules and with the dissipative forces in the fluid in such a way that the pinches occur as described.</p>
<p>The geometrical model for a pinch is illustrated in <xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9</xref>. Each tubule is assumed to have a pinch site at its midpoint (i.e. with <italic>L</italic><sub>1</sub> = <italic>L</italic><sub>2</sub>); we make this simplifying assumption in our simulations, after verifying that more general pinch locations (<italic>L</italic><sub>1</sub> <italic>/</italic>= <italic>L</italic><sub>2</sub>) have virtually no effect on particle transport. The pinching events occur at the pinch sites stochastically and independently of each other. Each pinch is defined geometrically by three parameters from a random distribution (see below): (i) the duration of a pinch 2<italic>T</italic>, (ii) the time <italic>T</italic><sub><italic>wait</italic></sub> between the end of a pinch and the beginning of a new one on the same site, and (iii) the length of a pinch 2<italic>L</italic> (see <xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9</xref>). We assume for simplicity that all pinches are axisymmetric so, using the notation of <xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9</xref>, each tubule remains a cylinder of time-varying radius denoted by <italic>r</italic> = <italic>a</italic>(<italic>z, t</italic>). Pinches are assumed to have reflectional symmetry about the plane in the crosssection through the centre of the pinch (i.e. <xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9</xref> each pinch is characterised by the same length <italic>L</italic> on either side of it). The total length of a tubule is denoted by <italic>l</italic> = <italic>L</italic><sub>1</sub> + 2<italic>L</italic> + <italic>L</italic><sub>2</sub>, so the portion before the pinch has length <italic>L</italic><sub>1</sub>, and that after the pinch is of length <italic>L</italic><sub>2</sub>.</p>
<p>We model the geometrical profile of each pinch of length 2<italic>L</italic> as following a linear radius change (see <xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9</xref>). Within a pinch located at <italic>z</italic> = <italic>z</italic><sub>0</sub>, the radius of the cylinder is therefore given by

<graphic xlink:href="523552v2_eqn2.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
The time-varying function <italic>b</italic>(<italic>t</italic>) ≤ <italic>R</italic> is therefore the minimum pinch radius in the centre of the tubule. As the simplest modelling choice, we assume in our simulations that <italic>b</italic> changes in time sinusoidally and thus will use <italic>b</italic>(<italic>t</italic>) = (<italic>R</italic> + <italic>b</italic><sub>0</sub>)<italic>/</italic>2 + (<italic>R − b</italic><sub>0</sub>) cos(<italic>πt/T</italic>)<italic>/</italic>2, where <italic>t</italic> is time after the pinch begins and <italic>b</italic><sub>0</sub> is the value of <italic>b</italic> halfway in time through the pinch. Choosing a smooth time variation for the function <italic>b</italic>(<italic>t</italic>) will ensure the continuity of fluxes in time (see <xref rid="eqn10" ref-type="disp-formula">Eq. (10)</xref> later). We have verified that changing the pinch shape to a smoother geometry has essentially no impact on the fluid volume expelled/taken in, and therefore no significant effect on the flows/transport.</p>
<p>In our simulations the stochastic pinch parameters are drawn from the distributions measured in Ref. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>]. The pinch duration 2<italic>T</italic> is therefore drawn from an exponential distribution with rate parameter <italic>λ</italic> = ln 10<italic>/</italic>0.167 s<sup><italic>−</italic>1</sup> (so the mean value is <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="523552v2_inline1.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> s), the time between pinches <italic>T</italic><sub><italic>wait</italic></sub> from from an exponential distribution with rate parameter <italic>λ</italic><sub><italic>wait</italic></sub> = ln 10<italic>/</italic>0.851 s<sup><italic>−</italic>1</sup> (mean value <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="523552v2_inline2.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> s) and the pinch length 2<italic>L</italic> from a uniform distribution with mean <italic>μ</italic> = 0.12 μm and variance <italic>σ</italic><sup>2</sup> = (0.06<sup>2</sup><italic>/</italic> ln 10) μm<sup>2</sup> <italic>≈</italic> (0.040 μm)<sup>2</sup>.

<title>Hydrodynamics of network</title>
<p>We assume that the fluid occupying the ER network is Newtonian. Flow inside the network occurs at low Reynolds number, which can be justified in the following fashion. From experiments in Ref. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>], we know that velocity scale relevant to ER flows is of the order <italic>U ∼</italic> 10<sup><italic>−</italic>5</sup> ms<sup><italic>−</italic>1</sup>. With a typical tubule radius <italic>R ≈</italic> 10<sup><italic>−</italic>8</sup> m and a kinematic viscosity of at least that of water <italic>ν ≈</italic> 10<sup><italic>−</italic>6</sup> m<sup>2</sup>s<sup><italic>−</italic>1</sup>, we obtain a Reynolds number of the order Re = <italic>UR/ν ∼</italic> 10<sup><italic>−</italic>7</sup>, so the flow is indeed Stokesian and inertial effects in the fluid can be safely neglected.</p>
<p>At a typical instance in time, a tubule undergoing contraction (or relaxation) causes a net volume flux to exit (or enter) the corresponding tubule. In the context of our graph theoretical model, we therefore model each pinch site as a ‘pinch node’ generating a net hydrodynamic source/sink whenever the tubule contracts/relaxes.</p>
<p>However, since it is not guaranteed that the total volume created by all pinching events always adds up to zero, we need a mechanism for the corresponding net volume to exit, or enter, the network. We achieve this through a number of ‘exit nodes’ that allow mass to be globally conserved. We locate the exit nodes at the exterior of the network and choose their number randomly. From a hydrodynamic standpoint, we impose the pressure condition <italic>p</italic> = <italic>p</italic><sub>0</sub> at each exit node to model their connection to a large fluid reservoir.</p>
<p>We numerically tested the robustness of our results to the details of the exit nodes by repeating simulations with different configurations. The exact choices of exit nodes turn out to not affect the transport results shown below provided there are sufficiently many of them to avoid channeling the entire network’s worth of pinch-induced flow into a few tubules towards the exterior, thereby producing artificially strong flows.</p>

<p>The velocity field in a straight cylindrical tubule at low Reynolds number is the classical parabolic Poiseuille flow [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>].

<p>The result in <xref rid="eqn3" ref-type="disp-formula">Eq. (3)</xref> is valid for a straight (i.e. not pinching) tubule, and we need to generalise it to the case of a pinching tubule.

<title>Solving the hydrodynamic network model</title>
<p>The incorporation of pinches as ‘dummy nodes’ into a graph theoretical framework of §IV A along with <xref rid="eqn10" ref-type="disp-formula">Eqs. (10)</xref> and <xref rid="eqn15" ref-type="disp-formula">(15)</xref> for the necessary pinch-related quantities allow us to reduce the problem of determining the time-dependent flows in an active pinching network into the simpler problem of solving at each instant for the instantaneous fluxes inside a ‘passive’ network with newly added nodes, appropriate sources/sinks, and modified pressure drops. Note that since the flows at these sub-cellular scales are inertialess (i.e. Stokes flows), we are able to effectively decouple time from our problem and solve the problem in the quasi-steady limit.</p>
<p>For each edge (i.e. tubule) (<italic>i, j</italic>) in the network, we define <italic>Q</italic><sub><italic>ij</italic></sub> to be the flow rate from node <italic>i</italic> to node <italic>j</italic>, with the sign convention such that flow is from <italic>i</italic> to <italic>j</italic> if <italic>Q</italic><sub><italic>ij</italic></sub> <italic>&gt;</italic> 0. For mathematical convenience, we define <italic>Q</italic><sub><italic>ij</italic></sub> = 0 in all cases where (<italic>i, j</italic>) is not an edge in the graph. The goal is to solve for the values of the <italic>Q</italic><sub><italic>ij</italic></sub>’s corresponding to each edge.</p>
<p>After the incorporation of the dummy nodes, we denote by <italic>N</italic> the number of nodes and <italic>E</italic> the number of edges. We label the nodes such that <italic>{</italic>1, …, <italic>M }</italic> denotes the <italic>M</italic> exit nodes.

<p>The K2 statement in <xref rid="eqn18" ref-type="disp-formula">Eq.

<p>To construct a cycle basis of the graph <italic>G</italic>, we use standard results from graph theory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>].

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>], <italic>D ≈</italic> 0.6 μm<sup>2</sup>s<sup><italic>−</italic>1</sup>. We include interactions between particles and walls by assuming that particles perfectly reflect off walls (i.e. elastic collisions). The particles are modelled as rigid spheres of diameter 5 nm, and the size of the particle matters only during elastic collisions with the walls of the tubules. As relevant in the limit of low volume fraction, we neglect hydrodynamic interactions between particles and perform ensemble averaging of the trajectories of many independent particles.</p>
<p>When a particle enters a node, we model its dynamics as follows. We consider a particle to have entered a node only if it has reached the end of a tubule, say of length <italic>l</italic>, at which instance we assign the particle to the node-point (i.e. the single point associated with the node in the graph description of the ER network). Although nodes contain a three-dimensional volume, their typical nodal length scale is of the order <italic>R ≪ l</italic>, and thus approximating them by point nodes is appropriate on the scale of the whole network. To decide towards which of the connected tubules the particle leaves the node, we estimate the values of the Péclet number Pe in each of the tubules. We define a local Péclet Pe<sub><italic>i</italic></sub> = <italic>U</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub><italic>R/D</italic> where <italic>U</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> is the mean flow velocity through tubule <italic>i</italic>, with <italic>U</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> <italic>&gt;</italic> 0 for flow out of the node and <italic>U</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> ≤ 0 otherwise. We then assume that the particle enters a neighbouring tubule <italic>i</italic> connected to the node with a probability proportional to max(Pe<sub><italic>i</italic></sub> + 1, 0). This ensures that we have the expected behaviour in both limits of Pe: at high (positive) Péclet numbers, the probability is proportional to the flow speeds in each of the connected tubules, while at low Péclet the exit of the node is limited by diffusion and thus the exit is equally likely in each tubule.</p>

<title>Data processing: instantaneous speeds and average edge traversal speeds</title>
<p>During each simulation, we compute the edge traversal speeds as follows.

The corresponding edge traversal time is then the time between the arrival at the target node and the most recent departure from the node of origin. The edge traversal speed is naturally defined as the length of the tubule (<italic>i, j</italic>) divided by the edge traversal time.</p>
<p>The average edge traversal speed associated with an edge (<italic>i, j</italic>) is then defined as the mean over all edge traversal events across (<italic>i, j</italic>) of the edge traversal speeds.</p>

<title>Incorporating slip boundary conditions</title>
<p>The methodology we have detailed thus far assumes no-slip boundary conditions at the tubule walls for the fluid flow. However, the membrane-bound lipids themselves could also flow in response to the nanoscale luminal flows. This may be modelled by introducing a finite slip boundary condition on the tubule wall. The slip boundary conditions with a slip length <italic>λ ≥</italic> 0 at the wall <italic>r</italic> = <italic>a</italic>(<italic>z, t</italic>) are given by
<disp-formula id="eqn22">
<graphic xlink:href="523552v2_eqn21.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="523552v2_inline6.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> <bold>n</bold> = 0, with <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="523552v2_inline7.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>, which simplifies to
<disp-formula id="eqn23">
<graphic xlink:href="523552v2_eqn22.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
We may then derive the long-wavelength solution for the flow field inside an axisymmetric deforming tubule as follows. Using an ansatz for the axial component <italic>u</italic> that is motivated by the uniform-radius Poiseuille flow with slip,
<disp-formula id="eqn24">
<graphic xlink:href="523552v2_eqn23.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
we may solve the incompressibility condition <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="523552v2_inline8.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>. Regularity at <italic>r</italic> = 0 constrains the integration constant to be zero, yielding
<disp-formula id="eqn25">
<graphic xlink:href="523552v2_eqn24.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
which automatically satisfies the boundary condition in <xref rid="eqn22" ref-type="disp-formula">Eq. (22)</xref>. Note that the mass conservation equations are not affected by the introduction of a slip length.</p>
<p>Using the new solution for <italic>u</italic>, the modified Hagen-Poiseuille expression with slip may be derived as before to be
<disp-formula id="eqn26">
<graphic xlink:href="523552v2_eqn25.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
which does recover the no-slip result as <italic>λ →</italic> 0.</p>
<p>These results may then be used to simulate particle transport with slip boundary conditions. In <xref rid="fig12" ref-type="fig">Fig. 12a</xref> we plot the distributions of average edge traveral speeds obtained from simulations of a C1 network pinching with the original pinch parameters from Ref.

<title>Estimate of forces required for pinches</title>
<p>In this section we derive an order-of-magnitude estimate for the forces required to pinch an ER tubule.</p>
<p>We first estimate the difference in the membrane’s elastic energy, Δ<italic>E</italic> = <italic>E</italic><sub>pinched</sub> <italic>− E</italic><sub>unpinched</sub>, between the pinched (<italic>E</italic><sub>pinched</sub>) and unpinched configurations (<italic>E</italic><sub>unpinched</sub>). In the absence of spontaneous curvature, the Helfrich free energy <italic>h</italic> per unit area of a membrane is given by
<disp-formula id="eqn27">
<graphic xlink:href="523552v2_eqn26.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
where <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>c</italic></sub> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="523552v2_inline9.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> are bending rigidities, <italic>H</italic> is the mean curvature, and <italic>K</italic> is the Gaussian curvature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>]. The mean and Gaussian curvatures may be expressed in terms of the principle curvatures <italic>κ</italic><sub>1</sub>, <italic>κ</italic><sub>2</sub> as <italic>H</italic> = (<italic>κ</italic><sub>1</sub> + <italic>κ</italic><sub>2</sub>)<italic>/</italic>2 and <italic>K</italic> = <italic>κ</italic><sub>1</sub><italic>κ</italic><sub>2</sub>. We take <italic>κ</italic><sub>1</sub> and <italic>κ</italic><sub>2</sub> to be the principle curvatures in the directions normal and parallel respectively to the tubule’s longitudinal axis.</p>
<p>The dominant contribution to Δ<italic>E</italic> is from <italic>E</italic><sub>pinched</sub>, specifically from the region near the pinch site i.e. the centre of the pinch, where the tubule radius is smallest, taken to be at <italic>z</italic> = 0. We have <italic>κ</italic><sub>1</sub> = 1<italic>/a</italic>(<italic>z, t</italic>) and <italic>κ</italic><sub>2</sub> = 𝒪 (<italic>R/L</italic><sup>2</sup>), yielding <italic>H</italic> = 1<italic>/</italic>2<italic>a</italic> + 𝒪 (<italic>R/L</italic><sup>2</sup>) and <italic>K</italic> = 𝒪 (<italic>R/aL</italic><sup>2</sup>). The dominant contribution to the membrane energy <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="523552v2_inline10.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> is therefore from <italic>H</italic>, in a neighbourhood of <italic>z</italic> = 0. Since real pinches do not have kinks, a linear term, for the purposes of estimating membrane energy, is unphysical, and we expect <italic>a</italic>(<italic>z, t</italic><sub>0</sub>) = <italic>b</italic><sub>0</sub> + 𝒪 (<italic>z</italic><sup>2</sup>) near <italic>z</italic> = 0, where <italic>b</italic><sub>0</sub> is the pinch radius in the centre of the pinch in the maximally contracted state and <italic>t</italic><sub>0</sub> denotes a time at which the tubule is in a pinched state. We may therefore write <italic>a</italic>(<italic>z</italic>) = <italic>b</italic><sub>0</sub> + <italic>Rz</italic><sup>2</sup><italic>/L</italic><sup>2</sup> to obtain an order-of-magnitude estimate of the membrane energy in the pinched state.</p>
<p>Evaluating the integral for <italic>E</italic><sub>pinched</sub> then yields the leading-order estimate
<disp-formula id="eqn28">
<graphic xlink:href="523552v2_eqn27.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
We may take <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>c</italic></sub>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="523552v2_inline11.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> (<italic>k</italic><sub><italic>B</italic></sub> is the Boltzmann constant times and <italic>T</italic> the room temperature) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>], with estimate values <italic>R</italic> = 30 nm, and <italic>L</italic> = 70 nm. The minimum pinch radius <italic>b</italic><sub>0</sub> may be estimated to be 10 nm allowing for membrane thickness and incomplete squeeze, yielding
<disp-formula id="eqn29">
<graphic xlink:href="523552v2_eqn28.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
The hydrodynamic dissipation during a pinch may be calculated using the flow field in a pinch (see §IV C for intraluminal flow field), and it turns out to be much smaller than the elastic contribution to the work done to pinch a tubule.</p>
<p>An estimate for the force required to pinch the tubule may then finally be obtained as <italic>F ∼</italic> Δ<italic>E/R ∼</italic> 30 pN.</p>

<title>Modelling of alternative flow generation mechanisms</title>
<p>We have described in detail our modelling of a network driven by the pinching of tubules. In this study we explore two other flow generation mechanisms: the contraction of tubular junctions and the contraction of ER sheets. Our model for pinching tubules is readily generalised to account for these mechanisms, as we describe below.</p>

<title>Experimental estimates of junction volumes</title>
<p>From fluorescence microscopy images of ER networks, we measure the fluorescence intensity of junctions (i.e. the number of pixels in a junction multiplied by the mean intensity per pixel). We can then translate this intensity into an estimate of junction volume, assuming that intensity is directly proportional to volume. In order to calibrate the fluorescence intensity, we use our measurements for tubules. Specifically, we use the measured intensities of tubules and their known volumes, obtained by measurements of tubule lengths and the assumption that they are cylinders of radius 30 nm, in order to determine the proportionality constant to convert between pixel intensity and volume. Our new measurement of the intensities of the junctions then allows us to obtain estimates of their volumes; we obtain twelve values, ranging between 0.0020 μm<sup>3</sup> and 0.0081 μm<sup>3</sup>, with a mean of 0.045 μm<sup>3</sup> and a standard deviation of 0.0021 μm<sup>3</sup>.</p>

<title>Mathematical modelling of contractions of tubular junctions</title>
<p>To include the contribution of tubular junctions into the model (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>), we assume that in addition to the pinch sites along tubules, each tubular junction pinches independently of other tubules and other tubular junctions. Given a junction, we assume that it expels the same volume Δ<italic>V</italic> of fluid during a contraction for all its pinches (and takes in the same volume when it relaxes). Each pinch is assumed to create a sinusoidal flow source, so a pinch lasting for a time 2<italic>T</italic> produces a flow rate <italic>S</italic>(<italic>t</italic>) = Δ<italic>V</italic> sin(<italic>πt/T</italic>)<italic>π/</italic>2<italic>T</italic> at a time <italic>t</italic> measured from the beginning of the pinch, where the numerical factors in <italic>S</italic>(<italic>t</italic>) are chosen such that the volume expelled during a contraction is indeed <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="523552v2_inline12.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>. We accommodate the flows from the junctions mathematically by modifying our K1 equations, <xref rid="eqn17" ref-type="disp-formula">Eq. (17)</xref>, to allow the normal nodes to also carry non-zero sources (as opposed to just the pinch nodes, as was the case before); the other equations in the model remain unchanged.</p>

<title>Mathematical modelling of contractions of perinuclear sheets</title>
<p>In the tubules-pinching model, we included <italic>M</italic> exit nodes located towards the exterior of the network and through which flow could enter and exit the system in order to conserve mass. To account for the connection to a perinuclear sheet (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1f</xref>), we now assign randomly a number of these exit nodes, denoted <italic>M</italic><sub>2</sub> <italic>&lt; M</italic>, to be ‘sheet nodes’ i.e. nodes which are directly connected to a peripheral sheet, so that a number <italic>M</italic><sub>1</sub> = <italic>M − M</italic><sub>2</sub> <italic>&gt;</italic> 0 of exit nodes remain. This is illustrated in Supplementary Fig. 13, where we show the C1 network from <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref> with both sheet nodes (blue asterisks) and exit nodes (red squares).</p>

<p>Similarly to the mathematical model with tubular pinches only, our independent variables are the <italic>E</italic> tubule fluxes, the <italic>M</italic><sub>1</sub> sources at the exit nodes, and the <italic>M</italic><sub>2</sub> sources at the sheet nodes.

<title>Experimental estimates of volumes of peripheral sheets</title>
<p>To model the contraction of peripheral sheets (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d</xref>), we need to estimate their contained volumes. Using the open-source image analysis software Fiji [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>], we identify nine regions roughly occupied by peripheral sheets in a microscopy image of an ER network; this is illustrated in yellow in Supplementary Fig. 14. We then measure their areas (in μm<sup>2</sup>) and convert them to volumes by multiplication with the diameter of a tubule; we take the diameter to be 60 nm i.e. we assume that the effective thickness of a sheet is equal to the tubular diameter. From our nine data values, we finally obtain a mean sheet volume of 0.12 μm<sup>3</sup> and a standard deviation of 0.04 μm<sup>3</sup>.</p>

<title>Derivation of theoretical bounds for active flows driven by pinching tubules</title>
<sec id="s4j1">
<label>1.</label>
<title>Advection due to a single pinch</title>
<p>In this section we calculate an upper bound for the axial distance Δ<italic>z</italic> a particle can be advected by the flow produced by an individual pinch. Recall the formula for the volume ‘source’ due to a pinch,
<disp-formula id="eqn30">
<graphic xlink:href="523552v2_eqn29.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
Among all possible ways for a particle to be transported by a pinch, an upper bound on the transport distance Δ<italic>z</italic> ≤ Δ<italic>z</italic><sub>max</sub> can be reached if all of the following conditions are satisfied: (i) All of the source flows to one side of the pinch (i.e. there is no leakage on the other side); (ii) The particle travels outside the pinching region (axial flows within the pinching region produce smaller advective displacements than those outside, as may be verified numerically); (iii) The particle travels along the centreline of the tubule (i.e. at twice the cross-section averaged flow velocity, a standard Poiseuille result); (iv) The minimum pinch radius <italic>b</italic><sub>0</sub> (recall from <xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9</xref>) is 0.</p>
<p>Under conditions (i) and (ii), the cross-section averaged speed corresponding to maximal transport generated from a single pinch can then be computed using <xref rid="eqn29" ref-type="disp-formula">Eq. (29)</xref> as
<disp-formula id="eqn31">
<graphic xlink:href="523552v2_eqn30.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
Using condition (iii), the position of the particle along the centreline <italic>z</italic>(<italic>t</italic>) satisfies then the ordinary differential equation
<disp-formula id="eqn32">
<graphic xlink:href="523552v2_eqn31.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
Integrating this equation from <italic>t</italic> = 0 (start of contraction, with <italic>b</italic>(0) = <italic>R</italic>) to <italic>T</italic> (end of contraction, with <italic>b</italic>(<italic>T</italic>) = <italic>b</italic><sub>0</sub>) then leads to

<title>Extension to nonlinear interactions between two pinches</title>
<p>An isolated pinch is only capable of reciprocal motions. The simplest system capable of producing non-reciprocal motions is illustrated in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> and consists of two pinch sites arranged in series near the midpoint of a long horizontal tubule.</p>
<p>We may calculate an upper bound on the net particle displacement that can be achieved after both pinch sites pinch exactly once. We make the assumptions (ii)-(iv) as above, and in addition, allow pinches to spend extended amounts of time in their completely closed state; any deviation from these assumptions will result in net transport that is further reduced.</p>
<p>How can we maximise the positive (i.e. rightward in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>) particle displacements induced by the contractions, and minimise the magnitude of the negative (leftward) displacement induced by relaxations? As in the figure, let us denote the pinch on the left ‘pinch 1’ and that on the right ‘pinch 2’. Pinch 1 produces maximum positive displacement (magnitude 4<italic>L/</italic>3, i.e. half of the optimal from <xref rid="eqn33" ref-type="disp-formula">Eq. (33)</xref>) when pinch 2 is completely open i.e. when the hydrodynamic resistance to its right is minimal. Pinch 2 then produces maximum positive displacement (of magnitude 8<italic>L/</italic>3, i.e. the optimal value in <xref rid="eqn33" ref-type="disp-formula">Eq. (33)</xref>) when pinch 1 is completely closed and all pinch-induced flow continues to be directed rightwards. Similarly, pinch 1 produces minimal negative displacement when pinch 2 is completely closed (zero average displacement, since no flow is then allowed to escape to the right of pinch 2), while pinch 2 then produces a negative displacement of magnitude 4<italic>L/</italic>3 to the left when pinch 1 is completely open. These optima can be achieved by the non-reciprocal sequence of motions illustrated in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>: close pinch 1, close pinch 2, open pinch 1, open pinch 2. The coordination between two pinches can therefore be used to generate the net displacement of 8<italic>L/</italic>3 equal to the theoretical upper bound from <xref rid="eqn33" ref-type="disp-formula">Eq. (33)</xref>.</p>

<p>This study explores the physical principles underlying fluid flow and luminal transport within the endoplasmic reticulum; its <bold>important</bold> contribution is to highlight the strong physical constraints imposed by viscous dissipation in nanoscopic tubular networks. In particular, the work presents <bold>convincing</bold> evidence that commonly discussed mechanisms such as tubular contraction are unlikely to be at the origin of the observed transport velocities. As this study is solely theoretical and concerned with order of magnitude estimates, its main conclusions await experimental validation. The work will be of relevance to cell biologists and physicists interested in organelle dynamics.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This study explores theoretically the consequences of structural fluctuations of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) morphology called contractions on molecular transport. Most of the manuscript consists of the construction of an interesting theoretical flow field (physical model) under various hypothetical assumptions. The computational modeling is followed by some simulations</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors are focusing their attention on testing the hypothesis that a local flow in the tubule could be driven by tubular pinching. We recall that trafficking in the ER is considered to be mostly driven by diffusion at least at a spatial scale that is large enough to account for averaging of any random flow occurring from multiple directions [note that this is not the case for plants].</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The manuscript extensively details the construction of the theoretical model, occupying a significant portion of the manuscript. While this section contains interesting computations, its relevance and utility could be better emphasized, perhaps warranting a reorganization of the manuscript to foreground this critical aspect.</p>
<p>Overall, the manuscript appears highly technical with limited conclusive insights, particularly lacking predictions confirmed by experimental validation. There is an absence of substantial conclusions regarding molecular trafficking within the ER.</p>

<p>The new energetic estimates in the revision might help constrain possible hypotheses for the mechanism(s) driving peripheral sheet contraction, and suggest if a dedicated ATP-driven mechanism is required.</p>

<p>We are grateful for this suggestion. The need to rationalise pathology associated with the subtle effects of ER-morphogens’ mutations is indeed pointed out as one factor motivating the study of the interplay between ER structure and performance. In the revised manuscript, we plan to include a brief discussion potentially linking ER morphogenes’ malfunction to luminal transport, integrating additional freshly published data.</p>

We recall that trafficking in the ER is considered to be mostly driven by diffusion at least at a spatial scale that is large enough to account for averaging of any random flow occurring from multiple directions [note that this is not the case for plants].</p>

<p>We thank the reviewer. We have indeed explored here the possibilities of active transport, focusing especially on transport over the length scale of single tubules, as a result of structural fluctuations, and found tubular pinching to be ineffective compared to e.g. peripheral sheets fluctuations. In the revised version we plan to add text mentioning what is known about the ER in plants.</p>

<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The manuscript extensively details the construction of the theoretical model, occupying a significant portion of the manuscript. While this section contains interesting computations, its relevance and utility could be better emphasized, perhaps warranting a reorganization of the manuscript to foreground this critical aspect.</p>
<p>Overall, the manuscript appears highly technical with limited conclusive insights, particularly lacking predictions confirmed by experimental validation. There is an absence of substantial conclusions regarding molecular trafficking within the ER.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We sought to balance the theoretical/computational details of our model with the biophysical conclusions drawn from its predictions. Given the model's complexity and novelty, it was essential to elucidate the theoretical underpinnings comprehensively, in order to allow others to implement it in the future with additional, or different, parameters. To maintain clarity and focus in the main text, we have judiciously relegated extensive technical details to the methods section or supplementary materials, and divided the text into stand-alone section headings allowing the reader to skip through to conclusions.</p>
<p>The primary focus of our manuscript is to introduce and explore, via our theoretical model, the interplay between ER structure dynamics and molecular transport. Our approach, while in silico, generates concrete predictions about the physical processes underpinning luminal motion within the ER. For instance, our findings challenge the previously postulated role of small tubular contractions in driving luminal flow, instead highlighting the potential significance of local flat ER areas—empirically documented entities—for facilitating such motion.</p>
<p>Furthermore, by deducing what type of transport may or may not occur within the range of possible ER structural fluctuations, our model offers detailed predictions designed to bridge the gap between theoretical insight and experimental verification. These predictions detail the spatial and temporal parameters essential for effective transport, delineating plausible values for these parameters. We hope that the model’s predictions will invite experimentalists to devise innovative methodologies to test them. We plan to introduce text edits to the revised version to clarify these.</p>
