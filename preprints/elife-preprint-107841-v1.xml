<title>Abstract</title><p>The G1 and G2 variants of the gene encoding Apolipoprotein L1 (<italic>APOL1</italic>) increase risk for kidney disease and cardiometabolic traits. While previous studies have elucidated key mechanisms by which G1 and G2 <italic>APOL1</italic> cause cellular inflammation and cytotoxicity, it remains unclear whether these mechanisms drive inflammation in G1 and G2 macrophages. In this study, we used mouse bone-marrow-derived macrophages and human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived macrophages to identify altered immune signaling and inflammatory activation caused by G1 and G2 <italic>APOL1</italic>. We demonstrated that G1 and G2 APOL1 increased lipid accumulation, pro-inflammatory cytokine expression, and inflammasome signaling; this inflammatory response was sustained when treated with anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-4 and IL-10. Additionally, in G1 and G2 macrophages we observed increased mitochondrial size and elongation, oxidative phosphorylation, and glycolysis. Finally, we used unbiased metabolite analysis to identify an accumulation of polyamine spermidine and the enrichment of the spermidine synthesis pathway in G1 and G2 macrophages. When treated with polyamine inhibitor Î±-difluoromethylornithine (DFMO), lipid accumulation and inflammasome gene expression decreased in G1 and G2 macrophages. Together, these findings establish the pro-inflammatory effects of G1 and G2 <italic>APOL1</italic> in macrophages and identify a novel pathway which ameliorates G1 and G2 effects on cellular inflammation.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Chronic kidney disease (CKD) affects approximately 10% of the global population, and more than 14% of the United States population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>). Within CKD, there is a disparity of greater disease prevalence among the US African American population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>). Beyond kidney disease, African American individuals are also more at risk of developing atherosclerosis, obesity, and hypertension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>). Part of this disparity is attributed to two risk alleles within the gene encoding Apolipoprotein L1 (<italic>APOL1</italic>) termed G1 and G2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>). The G1 variant contains the non-synonymous coding variants rs73885319 (S342G) and rs60910145 (I384M). The G2 contains the 6 base pair deletion (rs71785313) which deletes two amino acids N388 and Y389. Individuals with 2 copies of the <italic>APOL1</italic> G1 or APOL1 G2 risk variants (RV) face increased risk for kidney disease and possibly cardiometabolic traits compared to those with at least one copy of the non-risk allele (G0). A recent study also demonstrated that carrying one <italic>APOL1</italic> risk allele can increase the risk of CKD in West Africans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>). Numerous reports confirm that <italic>APOL1</italic> risk alleles increase the risk for focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, HIV-associated nephropathy, and COVID-19-associated nephropathy, all of which fall within the spectrum of APOL1-mediated kidney disease (AMKD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>). Some reports have also shown an association between <italic>APOL1</italic> risk alleles and atherosclerosis, obesity, and hypertension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>). The specific molecular mechanisms underlying this increased risk are still under investigation.</p>
<p>G1 and G2 APOL1 arose due to evolutionary pressure against trypanosomiasis and are only found in individuals with recent African ancestry. APOL1 evolved as a resistance factor to trypanosomes which cause African trypanosomiasis, <italic>Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense</italic> and <italic>Trypanosoma brucei gambiense</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>). APOL1 G1 and G2 variants are able to escape the trypanosomeâs serum resistance-associated (SRA) proteins and create a pore in the trypanosome lysosomal compartments, leading to lysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>). This pore-forming function of APOL1 has been shown to increase cation flux in epithelial cells leading to cytotoxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>). A new small molecule inhibitor of APOL1, VX-147, targets this pore-forming function in the context of podocytopathy and has shown some efficacy against AMKD in a phase 2a clinical trial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>). However, it is not known whether this channel activity occurs in immune cells and if VX-147 would be efficacious in those cell types.</p>
<p>During infection, the trypanosome faces the challenge of evading the hostâs immune system, which includes trypanolytic factors such as APOL1 but also innate immune responses from macrophages, which phagocytose the trypanosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>). In particular, trypanosomes secrete metabolites including indole-3-pyruvate to modulate metabolic signaling and inhibit the macrophageâs ability to mount a pro-inflammatory response to kill the trypanosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>). During trypanosome infection, it is advantageous for the macrophage to have an increased pro-inflammatory response to counteract immunosuppressive signals from the trypanosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>). However, outside of an infection context, sustained macrophage inflammation can lead to tissue injury.</p>
<p>As key regulators of tissue homeostasis, macrophages orchestrate responses to injury and inflammation through multiple functions including secreting cytokines, phagocytosing foreign bodies, and interacting with other cells in the environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>). When macrophage signaling is dysfunctional, this can lead to sustained inflammation and subsequent tissue fibrosis, thus promoting the development of CKD and other cardiometabolic traits characterized by low-grade chronic inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>). While these complex diseases are linked to <italic>APOL1</italic> risk alleles and also involve macrophage dysfunction in their pathophysiology, it is not well understood how macrophages contribute to AMKD or possibly APOL1-mediated cardiometabolic disease. G1 and G2 APOL1 have demonstrated cytotoxic effects in epithelial cell models by dysregulated ion flux, enhancing ER stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and inflammasome activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>). However, the effects of APOL1 in immune cells, e.g., macrophages, are relatively unknown. APOL1 is expressed in macrophages, and cellular stress in macrophages is directly related to inflammatory function and increasing inflammatory injury.</p>
<p>In this study, we explore the effects of G1 and G2 APOL1 in macrophage inflammatory signaling. Current literature has shown that macrophages expressing <italic>APOL1</italic> risk alleles have decreased maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>) and cholesterol efflux (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>). However, the underlying cellular pathways driving these phenotypes and any <italic>APOL1</italic> genotype-specific changes in macrophage inflammation and function have not been explored. We hypothesized that G1 and G2 APOL1 cause organelle stress and dysfunction, leading to a sustained inflammatory response in macrophages. To test this hypothesis, we used transgenic mice expressing APOL1 G0, G1, or G2 to generate macrophages from bone marrow. We discovered a sustained inflammatory phenotype in G1 and G2 BMDMs compared to G0 which was linked to elongated mitochondria, increased respiratory capacity, and accumulation of spermidine, a polyamine metabolite.</p>

<title>G1 and G2 APOL1 potentiate lipid accumulation in macrophages</title>
<p>Relevant to macrophage function, previous studies have shown that risk-variant forms of APOL1 trigger intracellular stress and inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>). Therefore, we hypothesized that macrophages expressing G1 and G2 APOL1 promote tissue injury by not entering a reparative state after pro-inflammatory activation. To evaluate the role of macrophages in AMKD, we examined kidney biopsies of individuals diagnosed with focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) in the context of a high-risk <italic>APOL1</italic> genotype. Light microscopy revealed foamy macrophages in the glomeruli of a high-risk genotype allograft (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). Foamy macrophages were also seen in the glomeruli of individuals with high-risk <italic>APOL1</italic> genotype and collapsing glomerulopathy (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>).</p>

<p>The role of foamy macrophages in FSGS pathogenicity and progression has been unclear and is unknown in AMKD. To test the effects of <italic>APOL1</italic> genotype on foam cell formation, we analyzed lipid accumulation in bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) isolated from APOL1 G0, G1, and G2 transgenic mice. BMDMs from these mice expressed low levels of APOL1 at baseline and higher levels of APOL1 when treated with IFNÎ³, a known modifier of AMKD (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>; <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Figure 1, A</xref> and <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>). We induced robust G0, G1, and G2 APOL1 expression in BMDMs with IFNÎ³ and performed lipid loading with oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL) for 72 hours. Brightfield imaging of Oil Red O (ORO)-stained BMDMs revealed increased lipid accumulation in APOL1 G1 and G2 macrophages compared to G0 following incubation with IFNÎ³ and oxLDL (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1, D</xref>, and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">E</xref>). Similar results were seen in BMDMs harvested from a separate transgenic APOL1 mouse line and incubated with acetylated LDL (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Figure 2</xref>).</p>
<p>To investigate potential drivers of genotype-specific effects on macrophage lipid metabolism, we measured the expression of lipid transport genes. When treated with IFNÎ³ and oxLDL, G1 and G2 BMDMs had significantly reduced expression of <italic>Abca1</italic>, a critical regulator of cholesterol efflux, potentially indicative of impaired lipid export (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>). Prior studies have shown that when macrophages become lipid-laden, they initially demonstrate anti-inflammatory patterns of gene expression but can develop phenotypic heterogeneity along the inflammatory spectrum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>). We hypothesized that lipid-loaded G1 and G2 macrophages would shift to a more pro-inflammatory state and found that <italic>Arg1</italic> expression, associated with a reparative macrophage phenotype, was significantly decreased in G1 and G2 foamy macrophages (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G</xref>). These findings suggest that G1 and G2 APOL1 contribute to dysregulated lipid metabolism in macrophages, potentially promoting foam cell formation and contributing to inflammatory disease processes.</p>

<title>G1 and G2 APOL1 promote inflammatory signaling in macrophages</title>
<p>Because macrophage inflammation can promote foam cell formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>), we next investigated the effects of <italic>APOL1</italic> risk variants on macrophage activation. To directly test how <italic>APOL1</italic> variants alter inflammatory signaling, we treated murine and human macrophages carrying <italic>APOL1</italic> variants with either inflammatory or anti-inflammatory stimuli. First, we evaluated genotype-specific macrophage responses to induction of robust APOL1 expression with IFNÎ³. We observed relatively higher levels of pro-inflammatory markers in APOL1 G1 mouse BMDMs compared to G0, including <italic>Tnf, Ccl2, Stat1, and Il18</italic> on gene expression array and a trend towards higher CD86 expression on flow cytometry (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2, A-D</xref>). APOL1 G2 BMDMs also expressed higher levels of <italic>Cd86, Cd38,</italic> and <italic>Ccr2</italic> compared to G0 but notably demonstrated a pro-inflammatory pattern that was more muted and distinct from G1 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>). Upon further stimulation with LPS, G1 BMDMs demonstrated significantly higher CD86 expression (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2, A-B</xref>). To validate the relevance of this result in a human model system, we tested the effects of IFNÎ³ and LPS on genome-edited G0 and G1 human iPSC-derived macrophages (iPSDMs), which expressed relevant constitutive macrophage markers and APOL1 when treated with IFNÎ³ (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Figure 1, C - E</xref>). G1 iPSDMs expressed higher levels of pro-inflammatory genes (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Figure 1F</xref>) while also secreting higher levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-8, CXCL11, MIP-1Î±, and DPPIV (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>). Unexpectedly, despite mounting a more robust inflammatory response, macrophages expressing G1 APOL1 did not develop excess cytotoxicity previously reported in other cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>). Upon treatment with 24 hours of IFNÎ³, BMDMs demonstrated approximately 15% lower cell viability among all genotypes; G1 and G2 variants did not cause any additional cytotoxicity (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Figure 3</xref>).</p>

<p>In various chronic disease states, macrophage dysfunction involves failure to reprogram from a pro-inflammatory to a reparative state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>). We hypothesized that G1 and G2 APOL1 promote sustained tissue inflammation by dysregulating macrophage response to anti-inflammatory signaling. Therefore, we tested whether the <italic>APOL1</italic> genotype modulates macrophage response to IL-4 and IL-10, which are known effectors in inflammation resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>). After induction of APOL1 expression with IFNÎ³, IL-4 treatment resulted in higher expression of pro-inflammatory CD86 on flow cytometry in G1 BMDMs and higher transcript levels of <italic>TNF</italic> and <italic>IL1B</italic> in G1 iPSDMs (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2, A</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">B</xref>; <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Figure 1E</xref>), suggesting risk-variant APOL1 contributes to impaired reparative reprogramming. A similarly attenuated response to IL-10 was also seen in G1 BMDMs and for key genes such as <italic>Cd86, Cd38, Fas,</italic> and <italic>Ccr2</italic> in G2 BMDMs on the gene expression array (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>). These findings were not significantly different between male and female macrophages (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Figure 4</xref>).</p>
<p>Because inflammasome activation, a known inhibitor of reparative macrophage reprogramming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>), has been implicated in driving APOL1 podocytopathy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>), we next investigated whether inflammasome pathways are activated in G1 and G2 macrophages. We observed that in the presence and absence of IFNÎ³, <italic>Casp1</italic> expression was significantly upregulated in G1 and G2 BMDMs compared to G0 and that <italic>Nrlp3</italic> expression was significantly upregulated in G2 relative to G0 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2, F</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">G</xref>). Although G1 and G2 BMDMs had higher levels of NLRP3 protein than G0 as seen on Western blot, no genotype-specific differences in protein abundance were seen for AIM2, cleaved Caspase-1, and cleaved IL-1Î² (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Figure 5</xref>), suggesting that G1 and G2 macrophages are primed for increased inflammasome activity but that additional stressors are needed to activate the inflammasome.</p>
<p>In macrophages, activation of the inflammasome can be directly caused by defective autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>), which has been observed in other APOL1 model systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>). Additionally, defective autophagy can contribute to foam cell formation by impairing cholesterol efflux (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>). Although we did not observe robust inflammasome activity in G1 and G2 macrophages stimulated with IFNÎ³, we hypothesized that G1 and G2 APOL1 would impair autophagic flux in macrophages, thereby promoting lipid accumulation seen in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>. To determine whether risk-variant forms of APOL1 disrupt macrophage autophagy, we performed a fluorescent autophagy assay in BMDMs. BMDMs incubated in the presence or absence of IFNÎ³ and oxLDL for 72 hours did not demonstrate major genotype-specific differences in autophagic activity (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2H</xref>), indicating that other mechanisms are driving G1 and G2 mediated dysregulation of macrophage inflammation and foam cell formation.</p>

<title>G1 and G2 APOL1 localize to the mitochondria, altering mitochondrial shape and function in macrophages</title>
<p>To further investigate potential mechanisms by which G1 and G2 APOL1 contribute to dysregulated lipid metabolism and macrophage inflammation, we evaluated the localization of APOL1 within the macrophage. Depending on the model system and antibodies used, previous studies in epithelial cells have reported APOL1 localization at the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>), mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>), and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>). We observed, by immunostaining of BMDMs that after IFNÎ³ induction, APOL1 protein colocalized with calnexin and TOM20, indicating that APOL1 is found at the ER and mitochondrial membranes, respectively (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). This localization pattern was seen across the G0, G1, and G2 genotypes. Concordant with this finding, multiple groups previously reported involvement of ER stress in mechanisms of AMKD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>). However, markers of ER stress activation, including phospho-PERK, phospho-IRE1Î±, alternatively spliced <italic>Xbp1</italic>, and ATF4 were not significantly expressed in any APOL1 BMDMs regardless of genotype and IFNÎ³ treatment (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Figure 6</xref>), establishing that ER stress is not a primary mechanism by which G1 and G2 APOL1 modulate macrophage function.</p>

<p><italic>APOL1</italic> risk variants are linked to mitochondrial dysfunction, as shown in podocytes, but the effects in macrophages have not been determined. Because macrophage activation is linked to mitochondrial signaling, demonstrated by others to be dysregulated by risk-variant APOL1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref>), we also investigated G1 and G2 effects on macrophage mitochondria. Recently, mitochondrial dynamics between fission and fusion have been found to alter macrophage phenotype, with the initiation of reparative reprogramming requiring mitochondrial fission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref>). To investigate the effects of G1 and G2 APOL1 on mitochondrial morphology in macrophages, we analyzed transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of BMDMs expressing G0, G1, or G2 APOL1 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>), quantifying mitochondrial area and circularity. Mitochondria in G1 and G2 macrophages exhibited increased area and reduced circularity compared to G0, indicating a shift toward elongated mitochondrial morphology consistent with more fusion seen in acute inflammation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>). This finding was recapitulated in G1 iPSDMs (<xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Figure 7</xref>).</p>
<p>In addition to alterations in mitochondrial dynamics, increased glycolytic activity and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) are essential for pro-inflammatory macrophage activation. When we measured oxygen consumption rate (OCR) in our macrophage model system, G1 and G2 BMDMs demonstrated significantly elevated maximal and spare respiratory capacity when treated with IFNÎ³ (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4, A</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">B</xref>). Given this observed increase in OXPHOS, we next evaluated glycolytic capacity via proton efflux rate (PER) in IFNÎ³-treated G0, G1, and G2 BMDMs and found elevated basal glycolysis in IFNÎ³-treated G1 macrophages (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4, C</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">D</xref>). Taken together, risk-variant forms of APOL1 in macrophages may promote sustained inflammation through local effects on mitochondrial morphology and downstream metabolism.</p>

<title>G1 APOL1 mediates modest potassium efflux in macrophages</title>
<p>Notably, we did not observe APOL1 localization to the plasma membrane of BMDMs, despite the reported role of risk-variant APOL1 mediating cation transport that promotes osmotic swelling and cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref>). Thus, APOL1-specific ion channel inhibitors such as VX-147 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref>), currently in clinical trial, would potentially exert limited effects on macrophage phenotype and function.

Therefore, to test the APOL1 ion channel hypothesis in macrophages at the functional level, we measured Thallium flux in G0, G1, and G2 BMDMs to evaluate genotype-specific effects on potassium transport. We found that when treated with IFNÎ³, G1 BMDMs demonstrated a modestly steeper Thallium flux slope than G0 BMDMs, a finding abrogated by the presence of VX-147 (<xref rid="figs8" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Figure 8</xref>), suggesting G1 APOL1 may potentially function as a cation channel on the plasma membrane. In contrast, no significant differences were found in ion flux for G2 BMDMs in the presence or absence of IFNÎ³ and VX-147.</p>

<p>To further investigate the effect of <italic>APOL1</italic> genotype on macrophage metabolic capacity, we performed steady-state metabolite analysis on APOL1 G0, G1, and G2 BMDMs. We identified the top differentially regulated metabolites in G1 and G2 BMDMs treated with IFNÎ³ compared to G0 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A, 5C</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>APOL1âs role as an innate immunity factor has informed studies investigating mechanisms of podocyte injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref>), but the role of its intrinsic expression in immune cells has not been as extensively explored. The APOL1 G1 and G2 variants are causal in multiple forms of kidney disease and are incompletely penetrant, leading to the âsecond-hit hypothesisâ of immune system activation as a trigger for AMKD development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref>). The role of immune activation in AMKD has been seen in HIV-associated nephropathy, lupus nephritis, and COVID-19-associated nephropathy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">75</xref>), highlighting the potential impact of immune cell function dysregulated by risk-variant forms of APOL1. Additionally, G1 and G2 risk alleles have been associated with differences in cardiovascular traits, including obesity, stroke, and plaque rupture in coronary artery disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">76</xref>), all of which involve immune cells, and in particular the macrophage, in their development.</p>
<p>In the kidney and other tissues, macrophages maintain tissue homeostasis but can contribute to disease progression if they remain chronically inflamed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">74</xref>). This study reveals novel findings of APOL1-mediated effects on macrophage function ultimately relevant to tissue injury and dysregulated repair. We observed higher levels of inflammation in G1 and G2 macrophages when robust APOL1 expression was induced by IFNÎ³, as well as more resistance to IL-4 and IL-10 signaling. Specifically, we observed increased expression of <italic>Ccr2,</italic> the gene for the receptor of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 and increases monocyte-macrophage recruitment(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">77</xref>). This pro-inflammatory priming may also contribute to the formation of G1 and G2 foam cells, a nidus of chronic inflammation. Previous studies have shown that G1 and G2 macrophages have metabolic defects including decreased cholesterol efflux, maturation, and increased eicosanoid production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>). Our oxLDL results confirmed Ryu et alâs findings of enhanced G1 and G2 lipid accumulation after aggregated LDL loading and ultimately connected these findings to metabolic dysfunction linked to the polyamine pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>).</p>
<p>Because prior studies revealed that risk-variant APOL1 can behave as a cytotoxic, druggable ion channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>), we initially tested whether APOL1 genotype affected ion flux in macrophages. We observed a modest effect for G1 BMDMs that responded to VX-147. Because G1 and G2 BMDMs differ in their pro-inflammatory profiles, differential ion flux may play a role in G1-mediated macrophage dysfunction but would not explain G0 vs. G2 differences. Instead, we found that APOL1, regardless of genotype, colocalizes with the mitochondria and ER, so we hypothesized that G1 and G2 APOL1 amplify macrophage inflammation through organelle stress. The APOL1 protein structure is characterized to contain several functional domains including a membrane address domain which is necessary for its cytotoxic effects in 293T cells(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">79</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">80</xref>). However, it is not clear whether these domains have any organelle or plasma membrane specificity. We had previously shown that G1 APOL1 promoted ER stress in kidney organoids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">77</xref>) but, to our surprise, found no genotype-specific effects on ER stress in the macrophage.</p>
<p>Because macrophage activation is tightly regulated by metabolism and mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">80</xref>), we evaluated mitochondrial dynamics and function, observing more mitochondrial elongation, higher oxygen consumption rate, and glycolytic activity in G1 and G2 macrophages compared to G0. The mitochondrial elongation in G1 and G2 BMDMs is not consistent with the increase in mitochondrial fission seen in primary G1/G1, G2/G2, and G1/G2 human proximal tubule cells treated with polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid in a prior study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">81</xref>), a difference possibly attributable to cell type. Consistent with our data, mitochondria of macrophages treated with LPS have been noted to appear more elongated during the initial acute phase of inflammation and then undergo more fragmentation over time as the macrophages adopt a pro-resolving phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">81</xref>), highlighting cell-type specific mitochondrial dynamics. In addition, our data were consistent with more spare respiratory capacity in G2 and G2 macrophages compared to G0, which differs from prior findings in epithelial model systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">82</xref>). The relationship between OXPHOS and macrophage inflammation is complex and context-dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">83</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">85</xref>), and it was unclear whether the genotype-specific differences in respiratory capacity were causal in differences in inflammatory response. To begin to investigate this, we performed metabolomics to identify perturbations of metabolites upstream and downstream of the TCA cycle. Although we had expected to find differential accumulation of TCA cycle metabolites relevant to APOL1âs localization, the significant finding from our metabolomics assay was enrichment in the polyamine pathway, which can modulate mitochondrial metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">86</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">87</xref>).</p>
<p>While the effects of polyamines in macrophage activation are associated with increased autophagy and resolving inflammation, the overaccumulation of spermidine can result in cytotoxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">88</xref>). Spermidine is also known to mediate the hypusination of translation factor EIF5A, which increases mitochondrial activity and fatty acid oxidation(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">89</xref>). Within the macrophage, the main source of polyamines comes from the conversion of L-arginine to L-ornithine which is subsequently decarboxylated into putrescine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">90</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c92">92</xref>). Arginine itself is a key metabolite in the activation of macrophages, as it is used to generate nitric oxide during pro-inflammatory responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93">93</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c94">94</xref>). While arginine metabolism was not a significantly enriched pathway in our metabolic analyses, there remains more to understand about the connection between arginine metabolism, spermidine metabolism, and the pro-inflammatory effects of risk-variant APOL1 in macrophages.</p>
<p>Beyond its role in macrophage autophagy, polyamines have long been known to be a key metabolic target for trypanosomes, the same parasite against which APOL1 has evolved to provide protective immunity. Indeed, DFMO, also known as eflornithine, has been approved as a therapeutic against late-stage trypanosomiasis since 1990 and since then has acquired approvals for other indications including hirsutism and neuroblastoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c95">95</xref>). In trypanosomes, DFMO prevents the production of thiols used for the reduction of oxidative species and can prevent the production of variable surface glycoprotein, a necessary component of the cell surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c96">96</xref>). These connections between the macrophage, mitochondrial metabolism, and trypanosome metabolism necessitate further investigation.</p>
<p>Our study has several strengths, including (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>) highlighting functional effects of APOL1 risk variants on macrophage phenotype and function relevant to cardiometabolic and kidney disease, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>) studies in both human and mouse model systems, and (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>) identifying a novel pathway that attenuates G1 and G2 effects on inflammation and lipid metabolism in macrophages. Our work also has several limitations to consider. First, significant differences have been reported between mouse and human macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c97">97</xref>), so we leveraged a human-based iPSDM system to validate findings. Our results show that the inflammatory profile and mitochondrial morphology of G1 macrophages are consistent between human and mouse. Validation of results would be further bolstered if replicated in primary monocyte-derived macrophages from G0/G0 and AMKD patients. Second, macrophage function varies according to tissue microenvironment, and tissue-specific molecular data from <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments or single-cell molecular data from tissue biopsies would be informative in establishing the macrophageâs role in APOL1-mediated disease. These data would validate G1 and G2 macrophage effects in relevant disease models including kidney and cardiometabolic disease.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the risk-variant forms of APOL1 exert effects on macrophage function, promoting sustained inflammation and altering mitochondrial and lipid metabolism. These effects, which ultimately impact tissue homeostasis and repair, develop independently of APOL1âs role as an ion channel, indicating that mechanisms by which APOL1 alters cellular function are specific to cell type. Therapeutic targeting of the macrophage for enhanced treatment of AMKD or cardiometabolic traits would require novel strategies, such as addressing the polyamine pathway.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Liu et al. investigated the mechanisms by which apolipoprotein L1 (APOL1) G1 and G2 variants cause inflammation and lipid accumulation in macrophages by bone-marrow-derived macrophages from transgenic mice and human iPS cells. Although these findings are not novel, this work provides solid evidence to prove enhanced inflammation and lipid accumulation in macrophages by APOL1 G1 and G2 variants by a variety of in vitro assays and metabolomics measurements. Further, metabolomics measurements identified that the spermidine synthesis pathway was altered by APOL1 G1 and G2 variants, and the polyamine inhibitor reversed the variants-induced phenotypes.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Their hypothesis and choice of experiments in each section were clear and mostly solid. Mitochondrial morphological quantification by transmission electron microscopy images was convincing. The authors confirmed APOL1 localization inside macrophages and built stories based on their findings. Showing relevant positive and negative findings in line with current knowledge of APOL1-variants-driven pathologies, such as cation flux, cGAS-STING pathways, indicates a good rigor.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Although most methods in this work were solid, the choice of Î±-difluoromethylornithine (DFMO) as an inhibitor of spermidine synthesis was not direct. It was still unclear if DFMO was reversing the phenotypes by lowering spermidine levels. Seahorse assay results would have avoided potential variabilities in cell densities by normalization. Heatmaps showing RNA-seq results would be appreciated better with a clear description of how the color is defined and calculated.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The G1 and G2 variants of the Apolipoprotein L1 (APOL1) gene are well-established risk factors for chronic kidney disease. While macrophages have been implicated in the pathogenesis of APOL1-mediated kidney diseases (AMKD), the precise impact of the G1 and G2 APOL1 variants on macrophage function and the underlying molecular mechanisms remains insufficiently characterized. In this manuscript, the authors investigate pathological phenotypes in macrophages carrying the G1 and G2 APOL1 variants. They report an accumulation of neutral lipids and activation of pro-inflammatory pathways, which appear to be at least partly driven by an accumulation of the polyamine spermidine and upregulation of the spermidine synthesis pathway. These findings reveal a pro-inflammatory role for G1 and G2 APOL1 in macrophages and identify the spermidine synthesis pathway as a potential therapeutic target.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors employ a comprehensive set of approaches to characterize macrophage phenotypes, including assessments of lipid accumulation, pro-inflammatory cytokine release, responses to M2-polarizing cytokines, autophagy, mitochondrial function, and metabolic profiling. The reversal of pathological phenotypes in G1 and G2 APOL1 macrophages by the polyamine synthesis inhibitor Î±-difluoromethylornithine provides compelling evidence supporting a causal role for spermidine in mediating APOL1 variant-associated dysfunction. Furthermore, the inclusion of both mouse and human models strengthens the translational relevance of the findings.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The manuscript would benefit from a clearer articulation of the specific role macrophages play in the pathogenesis of APOL1-associated kidney diseases to better emphasize the significance of the study. Additionally, the experimental design lacks a clear, logical progression, and the rationale behind some experiments is insufficiently justified, making certain conclusions difficult to fully support based on the presented data. Given the availability of established animal models of APOL1-associated kidney diseases, it is unclear why the authors chose to derive macrophages from the bone marrow of G1 and G2 APOL1 mice for in vitro assays rather than isolating and testing macrophages in vivo within these models. In vitro assays may exaggerate macrophage responses compared to physiological conditions, which could affect the interpretation of the data. Addressing this point would strengthen the manuscript.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Liu et al investigate the impact of G1 and G2 variants of the gene encoding Apolipoprotein L1 (APOL1) on macrophage inflammation. The authors have used bone marrow-derived macrophages and human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived macrophages as their model to identify altered immune signaling caused by G1 and G2 APOL1. The unbiased metabolite analysis indicates the possible involvement of altered polyamine metabolism in the regulation of inflammatory response in G1 and G2 macrophages. This study shows that targeting polyamine metabolism can limit macrophage inflammation and lipid accumulation in vitro conditions.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This study shows the importance of polyamine metabolism in the regulation of macrophage inflammatory response. The authors showed that spermidine synthesis is closely associated with altered macrophage functions with two risk-variant forms of APOL1 (G1 and G2). The altered macrophage lipid metabolism is known to be associated with macrophage dysfunction in G1 and G2 APOL1. However, the involvement of polyamine in the regulation of lipid accumulation and inflammation in macrophages in G1 and G2 variants is interesting and could be explored as a novel therapeutic approach for chronic inflammation.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The novelty of this study lies in the association of polyamine metabolism with lipid metabolism dysregulation in macrophages. The weakness of the manuscript is that insufficient experiments to support the claim of involvement of polyamine metabolism in the regulation of macrophage inflammation, which undermines the novelty of this study. The authors performed in vitro experiments targeting spermidine synthesis to show reduced inflammation and lipid accumulation, but have not performed any in vivo analysis of chronic kidney inflammation progression in G1 and G2 mice, which they have used to generate bone-marrow-derived macrophages. They have not shown any data that supports the specificity of DFMO in targeting spermidine synthesis.</p>
