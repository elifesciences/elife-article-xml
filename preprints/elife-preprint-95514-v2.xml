<title>Abstract</title><p>The organization of nucleosomes into chromatin and their accessibility are shaped by local DNA mechanics. Conversely, nucleosome positions shape genetic variations, which may originate from mismatches during replication and chemical modification of DNA. To investigate how DNA mismatches affect the mechanical stability and the exposure of nucleosomal DNA, we used an optical trap combined with single-molecule FRET and a single-molecule FRET cyclization assay. We found that a single base-pair C-C mismatch enhances DNA bendability and nucleosome mechanical stability for the 601-nucleosome positioning sequence. An increase in force required for DNA unwrapping from the histone core is observed for single base-pair C-C mismatches placed at three tested positions: at the inner turn, at the outer turn, or at the junction of the inner and outer turn of the nucleosome. The results support a model where nucleosomal DNA accessibility is reduced by mismatches, potentially explaining the preferred accumulation of single nucleotide substitutions in the nucleosome core and serving as the source of genetic variation during evolution and cancer progression. Mechanical stability of an intact nucleosome, i.e., mismatch-free, is also dependent on the species as we find that yeast nucleosomes are mechanically less stable and more symmetrical in the outer turn unwrapping compared to Xenopus nucleosomes.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>DNA base-base mismatches are generated by nucleotide misincorporation during DNA synthesis, meiotic recombination, somatic recombination between nearly identical repeats, or chemical modification such as hydrolytic deamination of cytosine <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. They are also introduced intentionally in some genome editing approaches<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>. DNA mismatches, if unrepaired, are sources of genetic variation such as single nucleotide polymorphisms and point mutations which can alter the cellular phenotype and cause dysfunction, diseases, and cancer <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. DNA mismatches also alter the physical properties of DNA such as local flexibility and conformational heterogeneity <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>In eukaryotes, DNA is packaged into a basic unit, the nucleosome, which consists of 147 base pairs (bp) of DNA wrapped around a histone octamer core <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. In vivo, nucleosomes are regularly arranged along DNA like “beads on a string”, with short linker DNA separating the beads <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>. It has been commonly observed that the rate of genetic variation along the genome is correlated with nucleosome positions.</p>
<p>Although not without an exception<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>, studies have shown that the base substitution rate is higher nearer the center of a nucleosome and increases with increasing nucleosome occupancy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. One possible explanation for this correlation is that nucleosomes impose a barrier preventing the repair machinery from detecting and repairing a mismatch <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup> or a bulky DNA adduct induced by ultraviolet<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>, thus leading to substitutions. Currently, it is unknown how substrates for DNA repair such as mismatches and bulky adducts may affect nucleosome mechanical stability and nucleosomal DNA unwrapping, which may affect accessibility of the nucleosomal DNA to the repair machinery.</p>
<p>RNA polymerase II can initiate transcription at 4 pN of hindering force<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup> and its elongation activity continues until it stalls at ∼ 10 pN of hindering force<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>. Therefore, the transcription machinery can generate picoNewtons (pN) of force on chromatin as long as both the machinery and the chromatin segment in contact are tethered to stationary objects in the nucleus. Another class of motor protein, chromatin remodeling enzymes, was also shown to induce processive and directional sliding of single nucleosomes when the DNA is under similar amount of tension (∼ 5 pN)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>. Therefore, measurements of nucleosomes at a few pN of force will expand our knowledge of the physiology roles of nucleosome structure and dynamics.</p>
<p>In an earlier work, we demonstrated a correlation between DNA flexibility and nucleosome stability under tension using the 601 nucleosome positioning sequence <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>. We showed that the 601 DNA around the histone core can unwrap asymmetrically under tension. One side of the outer DNA turn unwraps at a lower force and the other side unwraps at a higher force. The direction of asymmetry is controlled by the relative DNA flexibility of the two DNA halves flanking the dyad. Unwrapping force is lower for the nucleosomal DNA side with lower flexibility and vice versa. In addition, cytosine modifications that make DNA more flexible made the nucleosome mechanically more stable and vice versa<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Here, we examined the effect of a DNA mismatch on DNA flexibility and nucleosome unwrapping dynamics. We used a single molecule DNA cyclization assay to examine the flexibility of DNA containing a mismatch, and a single-molecule fluorescence-force spectroscopy method to study the effect of mismatch on nucleosome unwrapping dynamics. We also examined the mechanical properties of nucleosomes assembled using yeast and Xenopus histones on intact DNA, i.e. no mismatch, in order to explore the effect of yeast specific histone features<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup> on nucleosome mechanical stability.</p>

<title>Monitoring nucleosome unwrapping by fluorescence-force spectroscopy</title>
<p>To measure conformational dynamics of the nucleosome in response to external force we used a single-molecule assay that combines fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) with optical tweezers <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>. This assay allows us to use FRET to probe local conformational changes of the nucleosome caused by tension applied by optical tweezers through the two ends of the nucleosomal DNA.</p>
<p>The nucleosome was reconstituted using the nucleosome positioning sequence 601, with or without a C-C mismatch. We designed three DNA constructs 601-R18, 601-R39, and 601-R56 with the mismatches at R18, R39, and R56 positions situated in the middle of the outer turn, at the junction between the outer turn and inner turn, and in the middle of the inner turn, respectively (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). Because the distance between the mismatch positions (17, 21 and 38 bp) are not in multiples of 5 bp, they reside in different positions within their own super-helical turn. And the mismatches are at positions where the major groove face toward (R56) or away from (R18, R39) the histone core (R56) so they do not all share the same specific contacts with the histone octamer. Two fluorophores – Cy3 (FRET donor) and Cy5 (FRET acceptor) - were placed in appropriate positions to report on the unwrapping of various sections of nucleosomal DNA through reduction in FRET (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref> and Supplemental Figure S1). The two strands of the DNA construct were separately created by ligation of the component strands (Supplementary Fig. S1) to ensure that the resulting DNA does not contain a nick. The double-stranded construct was then formed by slowly annealing the two purified ligated strands over 3-4 hours. All four DNA constructs (601, 601-R18, 601-R39, and 601-R56) yielded nucleosomes with the same electrophoretic mobility and single molecule FRET value, indicating that the nucleosomes are homogeneously positioned for all four constructs (Supplementary Fig. S1). This is consistent with a previous single nucleotide resolution mapping of dyad position from of a library of mismatches in all possible positions along the 601 sequence or a budding yeast native sequence which showed that a single mismatch (A-A or T-T) does not affect the nucleosome position<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>.</p>

<p>In the fluorescence-force spectroscopy assay, a nucleosome was anchored to a polymer-passivated glass surface via biotin-neutravidin linkage on one end of the nucleosomal DNA. The other end of the nucleosomal DNA was attached to a bead held in an optical trap via a λ-DNA tether (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). As previously described <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>, we attached a pair of donor and acceptor fluorophores to the DNA to probe the unwrapping of nucleosomal DNA. To probe the unwrapping of the outer DNA turn, we constructed DNA with a labeling scheme called ED1 (end-dyad 1) in which the donor is incorporated on the 68<sup>th</sup> nucleotide from the 5’ end of the top strand (I68) and the acceptor is attached to the 7<sup>th</sup> nucleotide from the 5’ end of the bottom strand (J7) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). Upon nucleosome formation, the ED1 probe displayed high FRET due to proximity between the donor and the acceptor. We applied tension to the nucleosomal DNA by moving the piezo stage to which the glass surface attached at a constant speed of 455 nm/s while a focused laser (532 nm) follows the molecule to monitor fluorescence signals. The force increases nonlinearly and the loading rate, i.e. the rate at which the force increases, was approximately in the range of 0.2 pN/s to 6 pN/s, similar to the cellular loading rates for a mechanosensitive membrane receptor <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>. The force was increased from a low value (typically between 0.4 – 1.0 pN) to a predetermined higher value and then returned to the low value by moving the stage in the opposite direction at the same speed (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). We observed a gradual decrease in FRET - corresponding to an increase in the Cy3-Cy5 distance - as the force increases. Upon further increase in force, we observed rapid fluctuations in FRET, followed by a sharp decrease in FRET (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>), consistent with our previous studies <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup> and a more recent study <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup> utilizing high resolution optical tweezers with simultaneous smFRET detection. Upon relaxation through gradual decrease in force, the nucleosome reformed as reported via recovery of high FRET but at a lower force than the force at which unwrapping occurred, demonstrating mechanical hysteresis.</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<title>History-dependent mechanical stability of mismatch-containing nucleosomes</title>
<p>Electrophoretic mobility shift analysis and zero-force FRET values did not show a noticeable difference between unmodified nucleosomes and mismatch-containing nucleosomes (Supplementary Fig. S1), consistent with a previous study that showed that, at single nucleotide resolution, a single mismatch does not change the dyad position<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>. However, under perturbation by force, although unmodified nucleosomes showed the same behavior between stretching cycles <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>, mismatch-containing nucleosomes showed different behaviors between stretching cycles (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). The ED1 side of the mismatch containing nucleosomes unwrapped at lower forces for the first few cycles and then at higher forces for subsequent cycles. After relaxation, we observed a general trend of an increase in unwrapping force in the subsequent stretching cycles. One possible explanation for this observation is the re-positioning of the nucleosome such that the mismatch moves toward the dyad, bringing the ED1 probe toward the interior of the nucleosome, as predicted by a previous theoretical model <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>. According to this model, the nucleosome position is weakly affected by the presence of a flexible lesion on the DNA, but under perturbation by other cellular components which either stiffen the DNA overall or weaken histone binding, the lesion can be made to have a strong preference for the dyad position. In our experiments, applied tension during stretching may act as perturbation which weakens nucleosome binding. When the probes move closer to the dyad in the subsequent stretching cycles, more base pairs of DNA would need to be unwrapped for FRET to decrease, potentially explaining the observed increase in unwrapping force. However, since the FRET values in our DNA construct are not sensitive to the nucleosome position, further experiments with fluorophores conjugated to strategic positions that allow discrimination between different dyad positions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup> will be required to test this hypothesis.</p>

<title>DNA C-C mismatch enhances nucleosome mechanical stability</title>
<p>We compared the FRET versus force curves for constructs containing one C-C mismatch each at three different locations: R18, R39 and R56. We observed similar stretching patterns for the mismatch-containing nucleosomes (601-R18, 601-R39, 601-R56) to that of the 601 nucleosomes. However, the force range where FRET reduced gradually accompanied by fluctuations was wider and extended to higher force for mismatch-containing nucleosomes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> C-E). Because we observed increases in unwrapping forces for the second stretching cycle and beyond for mismatch-containing nucleosomes, we only used the first stretching cycle for comparing unwrapping forces between constructs. The averaged FRET vs. force pattern for 601-R39 showed an increase in unwrapping force for the mismatch-containing nucleosomes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). The increase in unwrapping force for all three mismatch containing constructs indicates that local flexibility of either the inner turn or the outer turn regulates nucleosome unwrapping (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). Next, we probed unwrapping of the nucleosome on the side that does not contain the mismatch for the construct containing a mismatch at the R39 position. In this configuration named ED2 (end-dyad 2), the donor was placed on the inner DNA turn close to the dyad (J58) which is similar to the ED1 construct, and the acceptor was incorporated to the opposite ends (I9) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>). Stretching curves of ED2 nucleosomes formed on the 601 sequence yielded higher unwrapping force compared to the ED1 side as reported previously <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>. The mismatch construct yielded nearly the same unwrapping pattern as the 601 nucleosome, suggesting the change in local flexibility induced by the mismatch has a strengthening effect against unwrapping only for the side containing the mismatch (the ED1 side).</p>

<title>DNA C-C mismatch enhances DNA bendability</title>
<p>A single DNA mismatch can cause DNA to deviate from the B-form conformation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup> and increase DNA flexibility <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>. A previous study using a DNA buckling assay suggested that C-C is one of the most flexible mismatches <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>. Therefore, we chose C-C as a representative mismatch to investigate its effect on nucleosome stability. We hypothesized that the stabilization of the nucleosome forming on mismatch containing DNA sequences is caused by its increase in DNA bendability. Therefore, we used a single molecule DNA cyclization assay <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup> to probe the change in apparent bendability of the right half (RH) of the 601 sequence upon introducing the C-C mismatch. In this assay (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>), DNA fragments with two 10 nt long 5’ overhangs were immobilized on a microscope slide. A FRET pair (Cy3 and Cy5) was incorporated at the 5’ ends of the overhangs that are complementary to each other, allowing us to detect high FRET when the two overhangs anneal with each other forming a circle. We used smFRET to quantify the fraction of looped molecules versus time after the high salt buffer is introduced in the chamber. The rate of loop formation, which is the inverse of looping time determined from an exponential fitting of loop fraction vs time, was used as a measure of apparent DNA flexibility influenced by a mismatch <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>. The faster the looping occurs, the more flexible the DNA is.</p>

<p>We measured the looping time of 4 DNA constructs corresponding to the right half of the 601 sequence (601-RH) with the addition of a C-C mismatch at the R18, R39 and R56 locations (601-R18-RH, 601-R39-RH and 601-R56-RH). As expected, we observed a dramatic decrease in looping time of the construct containing a mismatch (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>). Adding a C-C mismatch reduced the looping time from 57 min to 32 min (601-R18-RH), 9 min (601-R39-RH), and 32 min (601-R56-RH). The reduction in apparent looping time was larger with the mismatch placing at the center (601-R39-RH) than toward the side of the RH fragment (601-R18-RH,601-R56-RH) likely because the looping measurement is more sensitive to the change in flexibility at the center of the DNA fragment.</p>
<p>The cyclizability of surface-tethered DNA constructs was shown to possess an oscillatory dependence on the position of the biotin tether <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>. For example, moving the location of the biotin tether by half the helical repeat (∼ 5 bp) can lead to a large change in cyclization rate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>, likely due to the preferred poloidal angle of a given DNA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup> that determines whether the biotin is facing towards the inside of the circularized DNA, thereby hindering cyclization due to steric hindrance caused by surface tethering. We therefore performed control experiments to test the possibility that the observed higher cyclization rates of constructs with mismatches, as shown in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B-C</xref>, is an artifact specific to the biotin tether location used. We created two additional constructs, 601-RH-16 and 601-R18-RH-16, which are identical to the 601-RH and 601-R18-RH constructs, respectively, except that the location of the biotin tether was moved to a thymine base that lies 16 nucleotides further towards the center of the molecule. We chose 16 nucleotides because it is about 1.5 times the helical repeat, and thus cyclization rates should be maximally different from those of the original 601-RH and 601-R18 constructs. Further, there was a thymine base present there to which the biotin could be conveniently attached. Side-by-side, we re-prepared the original 601-RH and 601-R18-RH constructs. We found that the overall looping rates of both the 601-RH-16 and 601-R18-RH-16 constructs were higher than those for the 601-RH and 601-R18-RH constructs, indicating that moving the biotin tether towards the center of the molecule increases looping rate (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>). However, the 601-R18-RH-16 construct, which contains a mismatch, still looped faster than the 601-RH-16 construct without a mismatch (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>). We thus conclude that the presence of the C-C mismatch makes the construct loop faster, and that this is not an artifact specific to the biotin tether location. As we will show next, the looping time for different mismatch types showed broadly similar behavior to that observed from DNA buckling experiments, further indicating that the mismatch effect is an intrinsic property.</p>

<title>Effects of other mismatches on DNA bendability</title>
<p>There are eight different types of mismatches made from canonical DNA bases: A-A, T-T, C-C, G-G, G-A, C-A, C-T and G-T mismatches. We performed single molecule looping experiments of DNA containing a single mismatch introduced near the middle of the looping construct and determined the looping times for all eight constructs (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>). See Supplementary Materials for their sequences. We observed significant reduction in looping time compared to the intact DNA control (no mismatch) with the exception of G-containing mismatches (G-G, G-T and G-A mismatches). The C-containing mismatches (C-C, C-A and C-T) showed the largest reduction in looping times, suggesting that they make DNA most bendable. We also compared our looping times with the published measure of DNA bendability for the corresponding mismatched DNA where they quantified DNA buckling via FRET (<italic>E</italic><sub>FRET</sub> in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>. The two measures generally agree. However, we found sizable deviations from a linear relation for T-T and G-T mismatches. It is possible that the deviations may arise from sequence contexts, but we cannot exclude the possibility that the two assays measure slightly different aspects of DNA mechanics. Although performing fluorescence-force spectroscopy for non-C-C mismatches is beyond the scope of the current work, a testable prediction is that T-T and A-A mismatches as well as C-containing mismatches make a nucleosome mechanically more stable.</p>

<title>Yeast nucleosomes are less stable and more symmetrical than Xenopus nucleosomes in outer turn unwrapping</title>
<p>Next, we sought to examine how the source of histone proteins affects the mechanical stability of an intact nucleosome, i.e. without a mismatch. We reconstituted the 601 DNA construct with histone octamers of Xenopus and budding yeast. Note that all the data presented thus far on the effect of mismatches were obtained using Xenopus histones. Outer turn FRET probes on both sides ED1 and ED2 displayed slightly lower zero-force FRET values for yeast nucleosomes compared to Xenopus nucleosomes (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>), indicating that the DNA entry/exit may be more loosely bound on histone core for yeast nucleosomes. In contrast, the inner turn FRET probe showed similar zero-force FRET values for yeast and Xenopus nucleosomes. With pulling force applied, the stretching pattern for ED1 is similar for both nucleosomes while the strong side probe ED2 showed lower mechanical stability for yeast histones, with 40% of the molecules having unwrapping force of lower than 5 pN and the other 60% of the molecules being unwrapped by a force between 5-15 pN (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7A-B</xref>). The inner turn probe showed a stepwise unwrapping pattern with initial FRET reduction at less than 5 pN followed by stable FRET and a final unwrapping at a force higher than 20 pN (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7C</xref>). These observations for both outer turn and inner turn probes suggested that nucleosomes made with yeast histones are mechanically less stable, and unwrap less asymmetrically than nucleosomes made with Xenopus histones. Therefore, how DNA mechanics, determined by sequence, mismatch or chemical modification, is translated to nucleosome mechanics may be influenced by the histone core.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Using the looping time of single molecule DNA cyclization as a measure of DNA bendability, we showed that a DNA mismatch can increase DNA bendability. Our results for the selected mismatches are consistent with previous studies on the effect of a mismatch on DNA conformational dynamics using other methods such as NMR <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup> and the DNA Euler buckling assay <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>. A possible explanation for the enhancement of DNA flexibility is the existence of a kink at the mismatch position on the DNA. If and how the mismatch type-dependent DNA mechanics affects the sequence-dependent mismatch repair efficiency in vivo, as recently determined in a high through study in <italic>E. coli</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>, remains to be investigated. Comparison of mismatch-type dependent DNA mechanics to population genetics data is challenging because mutation profiles reflect a combined outcome of mismatch-generation, mismatch repair and selection in addition to other mutational processes.</p>
<p>We observed the enhancement of mechanical stability of nucleosomes reconstituted from mismatch-containing DNA constructs. A defect making the system more stable may appear counterintuitive but given that the same mismatch can make DNA more flexible, our findings are in broad agreements with previous studies that showed positive correlation between DNA flexibility and nucleosome mechanical stability when DNA sequences or cytosine methylation was altered <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>The 601 positioning sequence has TA-rich side that has four TA dinucleotides spaced with 10 bp periodicity and is more flexible than the TA-poor side <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>. The 601 nucleosome is more stable on the TA-rich side <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup>, which we attributed to the ease with which the more bendable DNA stays sharply bent around the histone core even under unwrapping force. Here, we introduced a mismatch to the TA-poor side with the aim of achieving a large contrast in the background of rigid DNA. Indeed, the mismatch induced a ∼7-fold increase in the rate of DNA cyclization of the TA-poor side. This increase in DNA flexibility matches the ∼7 fold larger cyclization rate of the TA-rich side compared to the TA-poor side <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>, suggesting that a single mismatch in the TA-poor side can symmetrize DNA flexibility of the 601 nucleosome. However, unlike flexibility symmetry achieved by TA repeats where which side unwraps at low forces became stochastic <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>, when the flexibility symmetry was obtained via a mismatch in the TA-poor side, the TA-rich side remained mechanically stable, unwrapping at only high forces. This difference suggests that although the apparent flexibility is similar between DNA containing a mismatch vs a flexible sequence element, the mismatch does not have a global effect on the coordination of unwrapping of the two DNA ends.</p>
<p>The enhanced nucleosome mechanical stability we observed suggests that a mismatch will reduce nucleosomal DNA accessibility. The reduction in nucleosomal DNA accessibility would hinder the activity of the DNA mismatch repair machinery on nucleosomal DNA. An unrepaired mismatch leads to a point mutation which may be the source for genetic variation during evolution and cancer progression. In fact, previous observations showed that the frequency of single nucleotide polymorphism is higher near the nucleosome dyad for nucleosomes that are strongly positioned in vivo<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. The higher frequency of substitutions in the nucleosomal DNA may be attributed to the difficulty of accessing the extra-stable nucleosomes. We also note that even without an enhanced stability, a mismatch within a nucleosome would be more difficult to detect for mismatch repair machineries compared to a mismatch in a non-nucleosomal DNA. Because mismatch repair machineries accompany the replisome, most of nascent mismatches may be detected for repair before nucleosome deposition. Therefore, the decrease in accessibility predicted based on our data here may be important only in rare cases a mismatch is not detected prior to the deposition of a nucleosome on the nascent DNA or in cases where a mismatch is generated via a non-replicative mechanism.</p>
<p>We chose the C-C mismatch for this work because a previous study showed that the C-C mismatch is one of the most flexible mismatches <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>. If indeed more flexible elements in the DNA make a nucleosome mechanically stronger, as shown here for the C-C mismatch and previously for different sequences and cytosine modifications <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>, we can predict that other mismatches, DNA lesions and alternative DNA structures such as DNA single strand damages, bulky adducts and R-loops <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup> that alter DNA local flexibility would also change nucleosome mechanical stability accordingly. Future studies are needed to test this prediction.</p>
<p>We also tested if histones from different species and different histone variants can affect nucleosome stability under tension for an intact DNA without any mismatch. We observed a slightly lower zero-force FRET value for both sides with ED1 and ED2 for yeast nucleosomes compared to Xenopus nucleosomes. Under tension, we found that the outer turn of yeast nucleosomes could be unwrapped at a lower force than Xenopus nucleosomes, and that the unwrapping pattern is less asymmetric for ∼40% of nucleosomes formed on the 601 sequence. The crystal structure of the yeast nucleosome suggests that yeast nucleosome architecture is subtly destabilized in comparison with nucleosomes from higher eukaryotes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>. Yeast histone protein sequences are not well conserved relative to vertebrate histones (H2A, 77%; H2B, 73%; H3, 90%; H4, 92% identities), and this divergence likely contributes to differences in nucleosome stability. Substitution of three residues in yeast H3 α3-helix (Q120, K121, K125) very near the nucleosome dyad with corresponding human H3.1/H3.3 residues (QK…K replaced with MP…Q) caused severe growth defects, elevated nuclease sensitivity, reduced nucleosome positioning and nucleosome relocation to preferred locations predicted by DNA sequence alone <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>. The yeast histone octamer harboring wild type H3 may be less capable of wrapping DNA over the histone core, leading to reduced resistance to the unwrapping force for the more flexible half of the 601positioning sequence. Overall, our data suggest that how DNA mechanics, determined by sequence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup>, chemical modifications<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup> and mismatches<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>, is translated to nucleosome mechanics may be dependent on species-specific differences in histone sequence and post-translation modifications, which need to be examined in future studies.</p>
<p>Previous studies have showed that the artificial 601 sequence do not preferentially or strongly position the nucleosomes in vivo as expected <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup>. It is certainly desirable to perform mismatch-dependent and species-specific nucleosome mechanics studies using native sequences but the fluorescence-force spectroscopy data of the type we acquired in this study would be difficult to interpret unless the nucleosomes are formed at a well-defined position. We recently reported a native sequence from the yeast gene SWH1 that forms a nucleosome in vitro centered at the dyad position in vivo<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>While the enhancement of the mechanical stability of the nucleosome can potentially lead to the nucleosome’s decreased accessibility for the mismatch repair mechanism, which can account for the accumulation of single nucleotide polymorphisms near the nucleosome dyad, other functional implications of the enhanced mechanical stability cannot be precluded. For example, enhanced mechanical stability might shield DNA from transcription, which prevents the expression of genes that contain misincorporated nucleotides. Another opportunity for future studies is the fate of oligonucleosomes under tension when one of the nucleosomes contains a mismatch.</p>

Typically, the fragments were mixed at the ratio of 1:1.2:1.5 for the first, the helper, and the second fragments for ligation with T4 DNA ligase (NEB) following the manufacture manual. The ligation mixture was then loaded on a denaturing PAGE gel to run electrophoresis for purification.

After purification, the two complementary strands were annealed by mixng at 1:1 molar ratio and heating to 90°C followed by slow cooling over 3-4 hours.

<p>We followed the protocol for force-fluorescence spectroscopy measurement published previously <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>. To construct the DNA tether for a Force-Fluorescence measurement, λ DNA was annealed to the reconstituted nucleosomes at one end, and to an oligonucleotide containing digoxigenin. The concentration of each element in the annealing reaction is 8 nM. During the experiment, the sample was diluted to 10 pM in nucleosome dilution buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2+</sub> or 1 mM spermine) for immobilization on the PEG coated microscope slide. To attach the micro beads for optical trapping to the DNA construct. we diluted 1 μm anti-digoxigenin-coated polystyrene beads (Polysciences) in nucleosome dilution buffer and added it to the imaging chamber for 30 minutes. The fluorescence-force data acquisition procedures include three following steps using a custom built setup according to <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>.

Second, to spatially avoid beaching of the fluorophores, we displaced the trapped bead from its origin where the labeled nucleosome is located by 14 μm. To locate the exact position of the label nucleosomes for confocal acquisition of the fluorescence signal, we scan the confocal laser around the tether’s origin. Third, to apply the force on the tether, the nucleosome was stretched at a constant velocity of 455 nm/sec<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup></p>

<p>In this manuscript, Ngo et al. report a peculiar effect where a single base mismatch (CC) can enhance the mechanical stability of a nucleosome. In previous studies, the same group used a similar state-of-the-art fluorescence-force assay to study the unwrapping dynamics of 601-DNA from the nucleosome and observed that force-induced unwrapping happens more slowly for DNA that is more bendable because of changes in sequence or chemical modification. This manuscript appears to be a sequel to this line of projects, where the effect of CC is tested. The authors confirmed that CC is the most flexible mismatch using the FRET-based cyclization assay and found that unwrapping becomes slower when CC is introduced at three different positions in the 601 sequence. The CC mismatch only affects the local unwrapping dynamics of the outer turn of nucleosomal DNA.</p>

<p>Mismatches occur as a result of DNA polymerase errors, chemical modification of nucleotides, during homologous recombination between near-identical partners, as well as during gene editing on chromosomal DNA. Under some circumstances, such mismatches may be incorporated into nucleosomes but their impact on nucleosome structure and stability is not known. The authors use the well-defined 601 nucleosome positioning sequence to assemble nucleosomes with histones on perfectly matched dsDNA as well as on ds DNA with defined mismatches at three nucleosomal positions. They use the R18, R39, and R56 positions situated in the middle of the outer turn, at the junction between the outer turn and inner turn, and in the middle of the inner turn, respectively. Most experiments are carried out with CC mismatches and Xenopus histones. Unwrapping of the outer DNA turn is monitored by single-molecule FRET in which the Cy3 donor is incorporated on the 68th nucleotide from the 5'-end of the top strand and the Cy5 acceptor is attached to the 7th nucleotide from the 5' end of the bottom strand. Force is applied to the nucleosomal DNA as FRET is monitored to assess nucleosome unwrapping. The results show that a CC mismatch enhances nucleosome mechanical stability. Interestingly, yeast and Xenopus histones show different behaviors in this assay. The authors use FRET to measure the cyclization of the dsDNA substrates to test the hypothesis that mismatches enhance the flexibility of the 601 dsDNA fragment and find that CC, CA, CT, TT, and AA mismatches decrease looping time, whereas GA, GG, and GT mismatches had little to no effect. These effects correlate with the results from DNA buckling assays reported by Euler's group (NAR 41, 2013) using the same mismatches as an orthogonal way to measure DNA kinking. The authors discuss that substitution rates are higher towards the middle of the nucleosome, suggesting that mismatches/DNA damage at this position are less accessible for repair, consistent with the nucleosome stability results.</p>

<p>The mechanical properties of DNA wrapped in nucleosomes affect the stability of nucleosomes and may play a role in the regulation of DNA accessibility in eukaryotes. In this manuscript, Ngo and coworkers study how the stability of a nucleosome is affected by the introduction of a CC mismatched base pair, which has been reported to increase the flexibility of DNA. Previously, the group has used a sophisticated combination of single-molecule FRET and force spectroscopy with an optical trap to show that the more flexible half of a 601 DNA segment provides for more stable wrapping as compared to the other half. Here, it is confirmed with a single-molecule cyclization essay that the introduction of a CC mismatch increases the flexibility of a DNA fragment. Consistent with the previous interpretation, it also increased the unwrapping force for the half of the 601 segment in which the CC mismatch was introduced, as measured with single-molecule FRET and force spectroscopy. Enhanced stability was found up to 56 bp into the nucleosome. The intricate role of mechanical stability of nucleosomes was further investigated by comparing force-induced unwrapping profiles of yeast and Xenopus histones. Intriguingly, asymmetric unwrapping was more pronounced for yeast histones.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Public Reviews:</bold></p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this manuscript, Ngo et al. report a peculiar effect where a single base mismatch (CC) can enhance the mechanical stability of a nucleosome. In previous studies, the same group used a similar state-of-the-art fluorescence-force assay to study the unwrapping dynamics of 601-DNA from the nucleosome and observed that force-induced unwrapping happens more slowly for DNA that is more bendable because of changes in sequence or chemical modification. This manuscript appears to be a sequel to this line of projects, where the effect of CC is tested. The authors confirmed that CC is the most flexible mismatch using the FRET-based cyclization assay and found that unwrapping becomes slower when CC is introduced at three different positions in the 601 sequence. The CC mismatch only affects the local unwrapping dynamics of the outer turn of nucleosomal DNA.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>These results are in good agreement with the previously established correlation between DNA bendability and nucleosome mechanical stability by the same group. This well-executed, technically sound, and well-written experimental study contains novel nucleosome unwrapping data specific to the CC mismatch and 601 sequence, the cyclizability of DNA containing all base pair mismatches, and the unwrapping of 601-DNA from xenophus and yeast histones. Overall, this work will be received with great interest by the biophysics community and is definitely worth attention.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The scope and impact of this study are somewhat limited due to the lack of sequence variation. Whether the conclusion from this study can be generalized to other sequences and other bendability-enhancing mismatches needs further investigation.</p>
<p>Major questions:</p>
<p>(1) As pointed out by the authors, the FRET signal is not sensitive to nucleosome position; therefore, the increasing unwrapping force in the presence of CC can be interpreted as the repositioning of the nucleosome upon perturbation. It is then also possible that CC-containing DNA is not positioned exactly the same as normal DNA from the start upon nucleosome assembly, leading to different unwrapping trajectories. What is the experimental evidence that supports identical positioning of the nucleosomes before the first stretch?</p>

<p>We added the following and refer to our recent publication1 to address this question.</p>
<p>“This is consistent with a previous single nucleotide resolution mapping of dyad position from of a library of mismatches in all possible positions along the 601 sequence or a budding yeast native sequence which showed that a single mismatch (A-A or T-T) does not affect the nucleosome position27.”</p>

<p>(2) The authors chose a constant stretching rate in this study. Can the authors provide a more detailed explanation or rationale for why this rate was chosen? At this rate, the authors found hysteresis, which indicates that stretching is faster than quasi-static. But it must have been slow and weak enough to allow for reversible unwrapping and wrapping of a CC-containing DNA stretch longer than one helical turn. Otherwise, such a strong effect of CC at a single location would not be seen. I am also curious about the biological relevance of the magnitude of the force. Can such force arise during nucleosome assembly in vivo?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>To address the comment about the magnitude of force, we added the following paragraph to Introduction. “RNA polymerase II can initiate transcription at 4 pN of hindering force2 and its elongation activity continues until it stalls at ~ 10 pN of hindering force3,4. Therefore, the transcription machinery can generate picoNewtons of force on chromatin as long as both the machinery and the chromatin segment in contact are tethered to stationary objects in the nucleus. Another class of motor protein, chromatin remodeling enzymes, was also shown to induce processive and directional sliding of single nucleosomes when the DNA is under similar amount of tension (~ 5 pN)5. Therefore, measurements of nucleosomes at a few pN of force will expand our knowledge of the physiology roles of nucleosome structure and dynamics.”</p>
<p>To address the comment about the stretching rate, we added the following to Results. We note that the physiological loading rate has been challenging to determine for any biomolecular interactions, and the only quantitative measurement we are aware of is that of an integrin that we are citing.</p>
<p>“The force increases nonlinearly and the loading rate, i.e. the rate at which the force increases, was approximately in the range of 0.2 pN/s to 6 pN/s, similar to the cellular loading rates for a mechanosensitive membrane receptor6.”</p>

<p>(3) In this study, the CC mismatch is the only change made to the 601 sequence. For readers to truly appreciate its unique effect on unwrapping dynamics as a base pair defect, it would be nice to include the baseline effects of other minor changes to the sequence. For example, how robust is the unwrapping force or dynamics against a single-bp change (e.g., AT to GC) at the three chosen positions?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Unfortunately, we are unable to perform the suggested unwrapping experiment in a timely manner because the instrument has been disassembled during our recent move. However, we previously performed unwrapping experiments not only as a function of sequence but also as a function of cytosine modification and showed that we can detect even more subtle effects7,8. In addition, please note that we are not claiming that simply changing basepair at the chosen sites changes the mechanical stability of a nucleosome so we do not believe the requested experiment is necessary.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) The last section introduces yeast histones. Based on the theme of the paper, I was expecting to see how the effect of CC is or is not preserved with a different histone source. Instead, the experiment only focuses on differences in the unwrapping dynamics. Although the data presented are important, it is not clear how they fit or support the narrative of the paper without the effect of CC.</p>

<p>We apologize for giving the reviewer a wrong impression. We included the data because we believe that information on how the histone core can determine the translation of DNA mechanics into nucleosome mechanical stability will be of interest to the readers of this manuscript. We now mention explicitly that the observation was made using intact DNA, i.e. no mismatch, in the abstract and elsewhere.</p>

<p>(5) It is stated that tRNA was excluded in experiments with yeast-expressed nucleosomes. What is the reason for excluding it for yeast nucleosomes? Did the authors rule out the possibility that tRNA causes the measured difference between the two nucleosome types?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We normally include tRNA because we found that it reduces sticking of beads to the surface over several hours of experiments. In yeast nucleosomes, we found that tRNA causes the nucleosome to disassemble. Therefore, we did not include tRNA in yeast nucleosome experiments. We now mention this in Methods as reproduced below.</p>
<p>“tRNA, which we normally include to reduce sticking of beads to the surface over the hours of single molecule experiments in a sealed chamber, was excluded in experiments with yeastexpressed nucleosomes because tRNA induced disassembly of nucleosomes assembled using yeast histones.”</p>
<p>We cannot not formally rule out the possibility that tRNA causes the measured difference between Xenopus - vs Yeast- nucleosomes. However, we have shown in our previous publication7 that the asymmetric unwrapping in Xenopus nucleosomes was modulated by the DNA sequence. When we swapped the sequence of the inner turn between the two sides, while tRNA was included in all experiments, we observed stochastic unwrapping instead. As part of our response to another reviewer’s comments, we also added the following on the relevant differences between the species in Discussion.</p>
<p>“The crystal structure of the yeast nucleosome suggests that yeast nucleosome architecture is subtly destabilized in comparison with nucleosomes from higher eukaryotes9. Yeast histone protein sequences are not well conserved relative to vertebrate histones (H2A, 77%; H2B, 73%; H3, 90%; H4, 92% identities), and this divergence likely contributes to differences in nucleosome stability. Substitution of three residues in yeast H3 a3-helix (Q120, K121, K125) very near the nucleosome dyad with corresponding human H3.1/H3.3 residues (QK…K replaced with MP…Q) caused severe growth defects, elevated nuclease sensitivity, reduced nucleosome positioning and nucleosome relocation to preferred locations predicted by DNA sequence alone 10. The yeast histone octamer harboring wild type H3 may be less capable of wrapping DNA over the histone core, leading to reduced resistance to the unwrapping force for the more flexible half of the 601positioning sequence.”</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Mismatches occur as a result of DNA polymerase errors, chemical modification of nucleotides, during homologous recombination between near-identical partners, as well as during gene editing on chromosomal DNA. Under some circumstances, such mismatches may be incorporated into nucleosomes but their impact on nucleosome structure and stability is not known. The authors use the well-defined 601 nucleosome positioning sequence to assemble nucleosomes with histones on perfectly matched dsDNA as well as on ds DNA with defined mismatches at three nucleosomal positions. They use the R18, R39, and R56 positions situated in the middle of the outer turn, at the junction between the outer turn and inner turn, and in the middle of the inner turn, respectively. Most experiments are carried out with CC mismatches and Xenopus histones. Unwrapping of the outer DNA turn is monitored by singlemolecule FRET in which the Cy3 donor is incorporated on the 68th nucleotide from the 5'-end of the top strand and the Cy5 acceptor is attached to the 7th nucleotide from the 5' end of the bottom strand. Force is applied to the nucleosomal DNA as FRET is monitored to assess nucleosome unwrapping. The results show that a CC mismatch enhances nucleosome mechanical stability. Interestingly, yeast and Xenopus histones show different behaviors in this assay. The authors use FRET to measure the cyclization of the dsDNA substrates to test the hypothesis that mismatches enhance the flexibility of the 601 dsDNA fragment and find that CC, CA, CT, TT, and AA mismatches decrease looping time, whereas GA, GG, and GT mismatches had little to no effect. These effects correlate with the results from DNA buckling assays reported by Euler's group (NAR 41, 2013) using the same mismatches as an orthogonal way to measure DNA kinking. The authors discuss that substitution rates are higher towards the middle of the nucleosome, suggesting that mismatches/DNA damage at this position are less accessible for repair, consistent with the nucleosome stability results.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The single-molecule data show clear and consistent effects of mismatches on nucleosome stability and DNA persistence length.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>It is unclear in the looping assay how the cyclization rate relates to the reporting looping time. The biological significance and implications such as the effect on mismatch repair or nucleosome remodelers remain untested. It is unclear whether the mutational pattern reflects the behavior of the different mismatches. Such a correlation could strengthen the argument that the observed effects are relevant for mutagenesis.</p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The mechanical properties of DNA wrapped in nucleosomes affect the stability of nucleosomes and may play a role in the regulation of DNA accessibility in eukaryotes. In this manuscript, Ngo and coworkers study how the stability of a nucleosome is affected by the introduction of a CC mismatched base pair, which has been reported to increase the flexibility of DNA. Previously, the group has used a sophisticated combination of single-molecule FRET and force spectroscopy with an optical trap to show that the more flexible half of a 601 DNA segment provides for more stable wrapping as compared to the other half. Here, it is confirmed with a single-molecule cyclization essay that the introduction of a CC mismatch increases the flexibility of a DNA fragment. Consistent with the previous interpretation, it also increased the unwrapping force for the half of the 601 segment in which the CC mismatch was introduced, as measured with single-molecule FRET and force spectroscopy. Enhanced stability was found up to 56 bp into the nucleosome. The intricate role of mechanical stability of nucleosomes was further investigated by comparing force-induced unwrapping profiles of yeast and Xenopus histones. Intriguingly, asymmetric unwrapping was more pronounced for yeast histones.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) High-quality single-molecule data.</p>
<p>(2) Novel mechanism, potentially explaining the increased prominence of mutations near the dyads of nucleosomes.</p>
<p>(3) A clear mechanistic explanation of how mismatches affect nucleosome stability.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) Disconnect between mismatches in nucleosomes and measurements comparing Xenopus and yeast nucleosome stability.</p>
<p>(2) Convoluted data in cyclization experiments concerning the phasing of mismatches and biotin site. ---</p>

<p>(1) In the introduction, the authors should also discuss the context of mismatches occurring during homologous recombination in meiosis or somatic cells in non-allelic recombination between near identical repeats.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Introduction now has the following.</p>
<p>“DNA base-base mismatches are generated by nucleotide misincorporation during DNA synthesis, meiotic recombination, somatic recombination between nearly identical repeats, or chemical modification such as hydrolytic deamination of cytosine.”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) Generally, it seems counter-intuitive in terms of biology that mismatches containing nucleosomes are more stable, as mismatches require repair and/or detection for heteroduplex rejection during recombination. Some discussion of this apparent paradox should be added.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>To address this comment, we added the following to Discussion.</p>
<p>“The higher frequency of substitutions in the nucleosomal DNA may be attributed to the difficulty of accessing the extra-stable nucleosomes. We also note that even without an enhanced stability, a mismatch within a nucleosome would be more difficult to detect for mismatch repair machineries compared to a mismatch in a non-nucleosomal DNA. Because mismatch repair machineries accompany the replisome, most of nascent mismatches may be detected for repair before nucleosome deposition. Therefore, the decrease in accessibility predicted based on our data here may be important only in rare cases a mismatch is not detected prior to the deposition of a nucleosome on the nascent DNA or in cases where a mismatch is generated via a non-replicative mechanism.”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) The authors discuss that the substitution rate is higher while the indel (insertion and deletion) rate is lower nearer the center of a positioned nucleosome. Are the differences between individual mismatches reported in Figure 6 reflected in the mutagenic profile?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We cannot currently compare them because the mutagenic profile even when it is available is a complex convolution of mismatch generation, mismatch repair and selection. Mismatch generation occurs through several different processes and how they are affected by nucleosomes and their mismatch type and sequence context is unknown. Mismatch repair process itself depends on mismatch type and sequence context as recently shown by a high throughput in vivo study11. And because the population genetics does not simply reflect de novo mutation profiles due to selection, comparison between mismatch-induced DNA mechanical changes and mutagenic profiles is further complicated. We added the following to the revision.</p>
<p>“If and how the mismatch type-dependent DNA mechanics affects the sequence-dependent mismatch repair efficiency in vivo, as recently determined in a high through study in E. coli11, remains to be investigated. Comparison of mismatch-type dependent DNA mechanics to population genetics data is challenging because mutation profiles reflect a combined outcome of mismatch-generation, mismatch repair and selection in addition to other mutational processes.”</p>

<p>*<italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations For The Authors):</italic></p>
<p>I have some concerns that, when addressed upon revision, would improve the manuscript:</p>
<p>(1) Page 6 and Supplementary Figure S1C: Though the FRET levels are the same for all nucleosomes, the distribution between the two levels is not. The nucleosomes with CC mismatches appear to have a larger fraction in the low-FRET population. This seems to contradict the higher mechanical stability. A comment on this should clarify it, or make this conundrum explicit.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for the comment. The low FRET population also includes the nucleosomes that do not have an active acceptor the fraction of which varies between preparations. We now note this in the supplementary figure caption.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) It is intriguing that a more stable nucleosome forms after several pulling cycles and it is argued that this might be due to shifting of the nucleosome. This seems reasonable and has important consequences both for the interpretation of the current experimental data and for the general mechanisms involved in nucleosome maintenance and remodeling. It is puzzling though how this would work mechanistically since it only seems to happen when nucleosomes are half-wrapped and when the unwrapped half contains the mismatch. From the previous work of the group and the current manuscript, it seems that shift does not occur in DNA without mismatches (Correct?). Does shifting happen for the 601-R18 and 601-R56 nucleosomes as well?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The mismatch-containing half is the half that is mechanically less stable in an intact, mismatch-free 601 nucleosome. So indeed, that is the half that is unwrapped in an intact nucleosome. But because the introduction of mismatch makes that half more mechanically stable, it can stay wrapped until higher forces, and the resulting structural distortion may cause the shift although we acknowledge that this interpretation remains speculative. Shifting occurs for all three constructs with a mismatch but not for the intact nucleosome without a mismatch.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) Could the shifting be related to the differences in sub-population distribution observed in Supplementary Figure S1C?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>/See our response to comment (1) above.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) The paper would have more impact if the mechanism of possible shifting could be clarified. This can be done experimentally with a fluorescent histone, as suggested in the manuscript. But having a FRET pair on positions in the DNA that would shift to closer proximity upon shifting, either at the ED2 or at the ED1 site will also work, is in line with the current experiments and seems feasible.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We revised the text as follows in order not to exclude labeling configurations with both fluorophores on the DNA while reporting on the shift. We are also happy to add an appropriate reference if the reviewer can help us identify an existing study that measured dyad position shifts through such a labeling configuration.</p>
<p>“However, since the FRET values in our DNA construct are not sensitive to the nucleosome position, further experiments with fluorophores conjugated to strategic positions that allow discrimination between different dyad positions14 will be required to test this hypothesis.”</p>

<p>We added the requested figures to Figure 5 and a new supplementary Figure 2, and added the following to Methods.</p>
<p>“Approximately 2500 – 3500 molecules were quantified at each timestamp during the experiment, and three independent experiments were performed for each sequence (Supplemental Figure S2).”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(6) Page 8/9: A control is added to confirm that the phasing of the biotin relative to the end affects the observed cyclization rate. However, the mismatch sites were chosen such that they included 5 bp phase shifts. This convolutes the outcomes, as the direction of flexibility due to the phasing of the mismatch relative to the biotin may also influence the rate. Was this checked?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We would like to clarify that the phasing of the biotin is not so much as with respect to the end, as it is with respect to the full molecule. Static curvature and poloidal angle associated with the DNA molecule (which is something that is ultimately determined by the full chemical composition of the molecule, including its sequence and the mismatch) could make the molecule prefer a looped configuration where the biotin points towards the “inside” of the molecule. Such a configuration would be sterically unfavoured during the single molecule looping reaction where the biotin is attached to a surface via avidin. However, if the biotin is moved by half the helical repeat (or an off multiple of half the helical repeat, essentially 16 nt as done in the manuscript), it would now point to the “outside” of the molecule. Therefore, to make sure that the difference between the looping rates of any two DNA constructs (say the 601-RH and 601-R18-RH) is a better reflection of differences in dynamic flexibility, we ensure that the difference persists even when the biotin is moved by an odd multiple of half the helical repeat. We revised the section as follows.</p>
<p>“For example, moving the location of the biotin tether by half the helical repeat (~ 5 bp) can lead to a large change in cyclization rate15, likely due to the preferred poloidal angle of a given DNA16 that determines whether the biotin is facing towards the inside of the circularized DNA, thereby hindering cyclization due to steric hindrance caused by surface tethering.”</p>

<p>(7) Page 9/10: The comparison of yeast vs Xenopus is interesting, albeit a bit disconnected. Since the single-molecule statistics are relatively small, did the nucleosomes show similar bulk FRET distributions, or did they also show a shift in FRET levels?</p>

<p>(8) The discussion calls for a more detailed analysis of the structural differences of the histones of the two species to rationalize the observed asymmetry in flexibility dependence: why would yeast nucleosomes be less sensitive to sequence asymmetries?</p>

<p>(9) It would also be interesting if the increased stability due to the introduction of mismatches observed on Xenopus nucleosomes holds in yeast. Or does the reduced stability remove this effect?

</disp-quote>
<p>Unfortunately, we are unable to perform the suggested unwrapping experiment in a timely manner because the instrument has been disassembled during our recent move. However, in terms of cancer relevance, our mismatch dependence experiments were performed using vertebrate nucleosomes (Xenopus) so repeating this for yeast nucleosomes would not provide relevant information.</p>
