<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Cancer cells display high levels of oncogene-induced replication stress (RS) and rely on DNA damage checkpoint for viability. This feature is exploited by cancer therapies to either increase RS to unbearable levels or to inhibit checkpoint kinases involved in the DNA damage response (DDR). Thus far, treatments that combine these two strategies have shown promise but also have severe adverse effects. To identify novel, better-tolerated anticancer combinations, we screened a collection of plant extracts and found two natural compounds from the plant, <italic>Psoralea corylifolia</italic>, that synergistically inhibit cancer cell proliferation. Bakuchiol inhibited DNA replication and activated the checkpoint kinase CHK1 by targeting DNA polymerases. Isobavachalcone interfered with DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair by inhibiting the checkpoint kinase CHK2 and DNA end resection. The combination of bakuchiol and isobavachalcone synergistically inhibited cancer cell proliferation <italic>in vitro</italic>. Importantly, it also prevented tumor development in xenografted mice. The synergistic effect of inhibiting DNA replication and CHK2 signaling identifies a vulnerability of cancer cells that might be exploited by using clinically approved inhibitors in novel combination therapies.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Genome integrity is particularly at-risk during S phase of the cell cycle, when thousands of replication forks travel at high speed along the chromosomes to duplicate the DNA. Replication initiates at specific sites called origins, which are sequentially activated throughout the length of the S phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Fragkos <italic>et al</italic>, 2015</xref>). Faithful DNA replication depends on the coordinated action of the many enzymes that make up the replisome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Attali <italic>et al</italic>, 2021</xref>). During this process, the parental DNA strands are separated by the CMG helicase, consisting of CDC45, the MCM2-7 hexamer and the GINS complex. DNA is synthesized on the leading strand by DNA polymerase (Pol) ε and on the lagging strand by Pol α-primase and Pol δ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Lujan <italic>et al</italic>, 2016</xref>).</p>
<p>Replication forks stall when they encounter obstacles such as DNA lesions, highly transcribed genes or tightly bound protein complexes, causing what is commonly referred to as replication stress (RS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Lin &amp; Pasero, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Macheret &amp; Halazonetis, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Zeman &amp; Cimprich, 2014</xref>). RS is associated with an excess of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), resulting from the uncoupling of DNA polymerase and helicase activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Pasero &amp; Vindigni, 2017</xref>). Stalled or collapsed forks can also give rise to DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). A signal transduction pathway called the intra- S checkpoint detects these stalled forks and associated DSBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Zeman &amp; Cimprich, 2014</xref>). Upon fork arrest, ssDNA coated by the ssDNA-binding heterotrimer RPA recruits the Ser/Thr protein kinase ATR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Zou &amp; Elledge, 2003</xref>). Activation of ATR by TopBP1 initiates a signaling cascade involving phosphorylation and activation of the intra-S checkpoint kinases CHK1 and WEE1, which coordinate a variety of repair mechanisms to prevent fork collapse, resume DNA synthesis and delay entry into mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Pasero &amp; Vindigni, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Saldivar <italic>et al</italic>, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Stracker <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref>). The presence of DSBs is also signaled by two other protein kinases, ATM and DNA-PK, which activate the checkpoint kinase CHK2 and result in cell cycle arrest or cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Blackford &amp; Jackson, 2017</xref>). ATR, ATM and DNA-PK phosphorylate the histone variant H2AX on S139 (γ-H2AX), which is a reliable biomarker of RS and DSBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Bonner <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>During the S and G<sub>2</sub> phases of the cell cycle, DSBs are preferentially repaired by homologous recombination (HR), which uses the sister chromatid as repair template (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Moynahan &amp; Jasin, 2010</xref>). In G<sub>1</sub> phase or in HR-deficient cells, DSBs are repaired by more error-prone pathways such as non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) and single-strand annealing (SSA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Chang <italic>et al</italic>, 2017</xref>). HR-mediated DSB repair is initiated with the resection of DNA ends to generate 3’-protruding extremities that are coated by the RAD51 recombinase to form a RAD51 filament involved in homology search (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Cejka &amp; Symington, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Chakraborty <italic>et al</italic>, 2023</xref>). RAD51 loading depends on BRCA1 and BRCA2, which also play a role at stalled replication forks to prevent the hyper-resection of nascent DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Tye <italic>et al</italic>, 2020</xref>).</p>
<p>In precancerous lesions, deregulated oncogenic pathways perturb the proper execution of the DNA replication program, leading to increased fork collapse and chromosome breaks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Macheret &amp; Halazonetis, 2015</xref>). This oncogene-induced RS, on the one hand, promotes cancer development by increasing genomic instability and promoting the loss of p53 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Halazonetis <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref>), on the other hand, it is a burden for cancer cells, which must deal with chronic replication defects and may become dependent on checkpoint function for their survival. This burden can be exploited for cancer treatment by the use of genotoxic drugs that further increase RS and/or by inhibiting the ATR pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Lecona &amp; Fernandez-Capetillo, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Ubhi &amp; Brown, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Zhu <italic>et al</italic>, 2020</xref>). Cancer cells eventually adapt to oncogene-induced RS, however, by overexpressing downstream components of the ATR pathway, such as Claspin, Timeless and CHK1, which correlates with poor prognosis in breast, lung and colon carcinomas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bianco <italic>et al</italic>, 2019</xref>). Thus, genotoxic agents used to increase RS in cancer cells are generally effective as first-line treatments to reduce tumor mass, but patients often relapse as the cancer cells become resistant to treatment.</p>
<p>Since cancer cells depend on an effective RS response for their survival, considerable effort has been made to develop small-molecule inhibitors of the intra-S checkpoint kinases ATR, CHK1 and WEE1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Dobbelstein &amp; Sørensen, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Lecona &amp; Fernandez-Capetillo, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Ubhi &amp; Brown, 2019</xref>). In principle, inhibiting these kinases should selectively kill cancer cells that have elevated levels of RS while sparing healthy cells. Several inhibitors have now entered clinical trials, with mixed results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Bradbury <italic>et al</italic>, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Gorecki <italic>et al</italic>, 2021</xref>). ATR inhibitors are usually well tolerated when used in monotherapy, but they have limited efficacy because low ATR activity can be compensated by ATM. ATR inhibitors are more effective when combined with subtherapeutic doses of chemotherapeutic agents (e.g. gemcitabine), but at the expense of serious adverse effects, such as myelosuppression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Dobbelstein &amp; Sørensen, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Gorecki <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Nazareth <italic>et al</italic>, 2019</xref>). CHK1 inhibitors are toxic, especially when used in combinatorial therapies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Neizer-Ashun &amp; Bhattacharya, 2021</xref>). WEE1 inhibitors are better tolerated when used in monotherapy and combination regimens, but clinical trials have shown only modest benefits so far (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Gorecki <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>). Thus, although some of these inhibitors are promising, they are still far from ready to be used in the clinic. Further efforts are still needed to identify new small molecule inhibitors, or combinations of inhibitors, that target the RS response in cancer cells but are not excessively toxic to normal cells.</p>
<p>To identify novel small molecules that target the RS response in cancer cells, we screened crude extracts of plants used in traditional Chinese herbal medicine for their ability to kill cancer cells selectively by inducing RS. An extract from the plant <italic>Psoralea corylifolia</italic> showed the most promising anticancer activity. We show that bakuchiol (BKC) and isobavachalcone (IBC), two compounds isolated from this extract, act synergistically to prevent the proliferation of cancer cells, by inhibiting DNA synthesis and by impeding the resection of DNA ends at DSBs, respectively. Together, these compounds reduce tumor growth and improve survival in a xenograft mouse model and IBC alone potentiates the anticancer effect of chemotherapeutic agents in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma cells. The synergistic effect of an inhibitor of DNA synthesis and an inhibitor of DNA end resection identifies a novel vulnerability of cancer cells that might be exploited by using clinically approved inhibitors of these mechanisms in novel combination therapies.</p>

<title>IBC and BKC synergistically inhibit proliferation of cancer cell lines</title>
<p>To identify novel combinations of small molecule inhibitors that target DNA replication in cancer cells, we screened a selection of crude extracts of Chinese herbal medicines for their ability to differentially impede cell growth and induce γ-H2AX foci in MCF-7 human breast cancer cells relative to non-cancerous BJ hTERT-immortalized human fibroblasts. In an extract prepared from <italic>Psoralea corylifolia</italic>, we identified two compounds, isobavachalcone (IBC; MW: 324.4; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Kuete &amp; Sandjo, 2012</xref>)) and bakuchiol (BKC; MW: 256.4; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Nizam <italic>et al</italic>, 2023</xref>); <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1A</xref>), which inhibited the proliferation of MCF-7 cells and A549 human lung cancer cells more than they did the proliferation of BJ fibroblasts and non-transformed epithelial cells MCF10A and RPE-1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">S1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">S1B</xref>). BKC is a bioactive meroterpene that possesses a variety of pharmacological activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Xin <italic>et al</italic>, 2019</xref>). It was shown to inhibit the proliferation of many cancer cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Li <italic>et al</italic>, 2016</xref>) presumably through the inhibition of DNA replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Sun <italic>et al</italic>, 1998</xref>). IBC is a natural chalcone that also exhibits potential anticancer activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Kuete <italic>et al</italic>, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Ren <italic>et al</italic>, 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Wu <italic>et al</italic>, 2022</xref>). However, the combined anticancer effect of BKC and IBC has never be addressed and their mechanisms of action and molecular targets have remained unknown.</p>

<p>Here, we have used a panel of eight tumor cell lines including two breast (MCF-7 and SUM159), one lung (HCC827), two prostate (PC3 and DU145), one lymphoma (U937), one colon (HCT116) and one ovarian (Ovcar8) cancer cell lines to investigate the antitumoral effect of IBC and BKC. We first determined the IC<sub>50</sub> of each compound in each cell line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Fig. S1C</xref>) and found that IBC was more potent than BKC in inhibiting the proliferation of all cell lines. We then evaluated the effect of combined use of IBC and BKC on the viability of the eight cell lines by using a concentration matrix approach and a quantitative colorimetric cytotoxicity assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Fig. S1D</xref>) from which we calculated the synergistic and antagonistic effects of the two compounds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1C</xref>), as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Tosi <italic>et al</italic>, 2018</xref>). In all cell lines tested, we observed a synergistic effect of IBC and BKC over a narrow range of concentrations (3–10 µM IBC and 10–30 µM BKC) and an additive effect of the two drugs over a wider concentration range. This ratio of 3:10 µM IBC: BKC that has a synergistic effect <italic>in vitro</italic> corresponds to the ratio of concentrations of the two compounds in the fruits of <italic>P. corylifolia.</italic> We conclude from this data that IBC and BKC inhibit cell growth in a synergistic manner and that this effect is more pronounced on cancer cells than on non-cancer cells.</p>

<title>IBC and BKC induce replication stress</title>
<p>To study the potential of IBC and BKC to induce RS, we assayed formation of γ-H2AX foci in MCF-7 and BJ cells treated for 24 hours with DMSO or with the two compounds, either alone or in combination. Cells were labeled with the thymidine analogue 5-ethynyl-2´-deoxyuridine (EdU) to identify cells in S phase and γ-H2AX foci were detected by immunofluorescence microscopy; γ-H2AX levels in S phase cells was quantified as mean fluorescence intensity. IBC increased γ-H2AX signal in MCF-7 but not in BJ cells, whereas BKC increased it in both cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">2B</xref>). Moreover, the combination of IBC and BKC further increased γ-H2AX fluorescence in MCF-7 but not in BJ cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2B</xref>), which is consistent with their effect on cancer cell growth. BKC alone or in combination with IBC also induced phosphorylation of CHK1 on S345 in MCF-7 cells, whereas IBC alone did not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">S2B</xref>). These data suggest that BKC, but not IBC, can directly induce replication stress.</p>

<p>To address this possibility, we measured the effect of IBC and BKC on replication fork progression in MCF-7 and BJ cells by using a DNA fiber spreading assay. Briefly, the cells were exposed to one or both drugs for 24 hours and then labelled sequentially with the thymidine analogues 5-iodo-2′-deoxyuridine (IdU) and 5-chloro-2′-deoxyuridine (CldU) each for 15 minutes and the length of replicated tracks was measured along individual DNA fibers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2D</xref>). Analysis of CldU track length showed that BKC reduced fork speed by a factor of two relative to untreated cells in both cell lines, suggesting that it directly inhibits DNA synthesis. In contrast, IBC inhibited fork speed more in MCF-7 cells than in BJ cells, indicating that it may affect DNA synthesis through a mechanism different from that of BKC. When used in combination, the inhibitory effect of BKC and IBC on fork speed was further increased, consistent with our finding that these drugs have a synergistic effect on cell growth.</p>
<p>To evaluate the impact of IBC and BKC on the cell cycle, we exposed MCF-7 and BJ cells to these drugs for 24 hours, labelled the cells in S phase with EdU for 30 minutes and analyzed the distribution of cells in the various phases of the cell cycle by flow cytometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Fig. S2A</xref>). Treatment with BKC, but not IBC, resulted in a greater proportion of both cell types in S phase, which is consistent with our observation that BKC, but not IBC, induced CHK1 activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">S2B</xref>). Together, these data suggest that IBC and BKC induce replication stress through different mechanisms to prevent cancer cell proliferation.</p>

<title>BKC inhibits DNA replication</title>
<p>Our data suggest that BKC might be a potent inhibitor of replication fork progression <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2D</xref>) that acts directly on replicative DNA polymerases. Using DNA fiber assay, we found that BKC inhibited fork progression in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2E</xref>). Furthermore, BKC treatment significantly increased sister fork asymmetry compared to DMSO-treated control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2F</xref>). We then compared its effect to that of aphidicolin, a well-characterized inhibitor of DNA polymerases α, δ and ε (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Cheng &amp; Kuchta, 1993</xref>). MCF-7 cells were treated with 40 μM BKC, 10 µM aphidicolin, or both for two hours and replication fork progression was measured by DNA fiber spreading. Remarkably, BKC inhibited fork progression more effectively than aphidicolin at these concentrations and the combined effect of both compounds was similar to the effect of BKC alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2G</xref>). BKC is a phenolic compound structurally related to resveratrol. Since resveratrol was shown to induce replication stress by inhibiting dNTP synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Benslimane <italic>et al</italic>, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Fontecave <italic>et al</italic>, 1998</xref>), we tested the possibility that BKC might also impede DNA replication by inhibiting dNTP synthesis. To this end, we tested its effect on a replication assay in <italic>Xenopus</italic> egg extracts, which contain high concentrations of dNTPs and do not depend on dNTP synthesis to sustain effective DNA replication. In this assay, demembranated sperm nuclei incubated in egg extracts decondense, assemble pre-replication complexes within 20 minutes and initiate synchronous DNA synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Mechali &amp; Harland, 1982</xref>). When added at the start of the assay (0 min), BKC (100 µM) exhibited a strong inhibitory effect on DNA replication, although not as profound as the effect of aphidicolin (60 µM). Moreover, when added after 40 minutes, long after initiation of replication, BKC was as effective as aphidicolin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2H</xref>), suggesting that it inhibits elongation. Consistent with this possibility, BKC effectively inhibited replication of ssDNA, a process that relies entirely on priming and elongation of DNA chains by replicative DNA polymerases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Fig. S2C</xref>).</p>
<p>We also performed <italic>in silico</italic> molecular docking to study the potential interaction of BKC with the catalytic subunits of DNA polymerases δ and ε. This analysis showed that BKC can occupy the deoxycytidine sites of both enzymes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3B</xref>). Using the Cellular Thermal Sensitivity Shift Assay (CETSA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Martinez Molina <italic>et al</italic>, 2013</xref>), we found that BKC interacts with the catalytic subunits of Polδ and Polε in MCF-7 cells to stabilize the thermal sensitivity of both proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3D</xref>). Importantly, BKC specifically stabilize the catalytic subunit POLD1 of Polδ, but not that of the accessory subunit POLD3 in <italic>Xenopus</italic> egg extracts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Fig. S3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">S3B</xref>). Similarly, BKC did not alter the thermal sensitivity of <italic>Xenopus</italic> PCNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Fig. S3C</xref>). Together, these findings indicate that BKC strongly inhibits DNA replication <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic>, most likely by directly inhibiting DNA polymerases.</p>

<title>IBC specifically inhibits CHK2</title>
<p>Previous studies found that IBC impedes cell proliferation by inhibiting AKT, a protein kinase involved in cell survival and in the transcriptional regulation of DNA replication-associated genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Jing <italic>et al</italic>, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Spangle <italic>et al</italic>, 2016</xref>). To determine whether AKT inhibition accounts for the effect of IBC on DNA replication in MCF-7 cells, we assayed the effect of IBC on the auto-phosphorylation of endogenous AKT at S473 and compared it to the effect of an allosteric AKT inhibitor, MK-2206. Whereas MK-2206 strongly inhibited AKT phosphorylation, IBC had no effect when used at the concentration that inhibited cell proliferation (30 μM), nor did BKC or a combination of both compounds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Fig. S4A</xref>). Moreover, unlike MK-2206, IBC had little or no effect on expression of the cell cycle genes encoding E2F1, E2F2 and PCNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Fig. S4B</xref>). Also, unlike IBC, MK-2206 had no effect on replication fork speed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Fig. S4C</xref>). We conclude that, at the concentrations used in this study, IBC inhibition of DNA replication cannot be explained by inhibition of AKT.</p>
<p>To identify candidate target(s) of IBC that are responsible for its inhibitory effect on cancer cell proliferation, we assayed the effects of a broad range of IBC concentrations on the activities of 43 cell cycle-related kinases <italic>in vitro</italic> and determined the IC<sub>50</sub> for each of them (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">S4D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">S4E</xref>). The most sensitive kinase, CHK2, had an IC<sub>50</sub> for IBC of 3.5 µM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4A</xref>). Aurora-A/B and JNK3 were also sensitive to IBC, but at approximately five-fold higher concentrations, IC<sub>50</sub> of 11.2 µM for Aurora-A/B and 16.4 µM for JNK3. By contrast, CHK1 was not inhibited by IBC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4A</xref>). Consistent with our findings above, the IC<sub>50</sub> for AKT1/PKBα was 56.7 µM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Fig. S4E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">S4F</xref>).</p>

<p>To validate the inhibitory effect of IBC on CHK2 <italic>in vivo</italic>, we analyzed the auto-phosphorylation of CHK2 on S516 induced by camptothecin (CPT), a DNA topoisomerase I inhibitor that induces RS and DSBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Pommier, 2006</xref>). In MCF-7 cells, IBC inhibited the auto-phosphorylation of CHK2 induced by CPT by approximately 50% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">S4G</xref>). Consistently, IBC also inhibited the activation of the downstream target of CHK2, BRCA1. We showed that treatment with IBC reduced the phosphorylation of chromatin-bound BRCA1 at residue S988 induced by CPT, as efficiently as the commercial CHK2 inhibitor BML-277 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">S4H</xref>). By contrast, IBC did not affect the autophosphorylation of CHK1 on S296 induced by hydroxyurea (HU; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">S4I</xref>). Using <italic>in silico</italic> molecular docking, we found that IBC binds to the active site of CHK2 by means of a hydrogen bond and 11 hydrophobic interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4E</xref>), whereas its binding to the active site of CHK1 is prevented by a steric clash with a tyrosine residue (Tyr86) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4F</xref>). To confirm the direct interaction between CHK2 and IBC, we performed the Cellular Thermal Shift Assay (CETSA) in MCF-7 cells. We showed that IBC altered the thermal stability of CHK2 as efficiently as the commercial CHK2 inhibitor, BML-277, without affecting the thermal stability of CHK1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4H</xref>). Interestingly, BML-277 seemed to have a slight effect in reducing the thermal stability of CHK1, although it was not statistically significant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4H</xref>). Together, these data indicate that IBC inhibits CHK2 without affecting CHK1 activity.</p>

<title>IBC prevents DNA end resection at DSBs</title>
<p>CHK2 phosphorylates BRCA1 on S988 to stimulate HR-mediated DSB repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Parameswaran <italic>et al</italic>., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Zhang <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>). Since BRCA1 promotes DNA end resection at DSBs to initiate HR, we investigated whether IBC might impede the formation of single-strand DNA (ssDNA) at DNA ends. To do so, we induced DSBs by treating MCF-7 cells with camptothecin and assayed the formation of ssDNA by monitoring binding of the ssDNA-binding factor RPA to chromatin by western blotting and by immunofluorescence microscopy. These analyses revealed that IBC inhibited the formation of RPA-coated ssDNA upon CPT treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">Fig. S5B</xref>).</p>
<p>To determine whether this effect was due to inhibition of DNA end resection, we used Single-Molecule Analysis of Resection Tracks (SMART) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Cruz-García <italic>et al</italic>, 2014</xref>). In this assay, the length of BrdU-labeled ssDNA tracks exposed by resection is measured after induction of DSBs in MCF-7 cells with bleomycin. We found that the BrdU tracks were significantly shorter when CHK2 was inhibited either by IBC or by the CHK2 inhibitor BML-277 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Arienti <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5D</xref>). Using the same assay, we found that IBC also impaired DNA end resection induced by gamma irradiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5E</xref>). Furthermore, we confirmed that IBC prevents DSB end resection by using the DIvA system, in which site-specific DSBs are generated by the restriction enzyme <italic>AsiSI</italic> to allow the quantification of ssDNA generated at break sites by quantitative PCR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Iacovoni <italic>et al</italic>, 2010</xref>). IBC inhibited the formation of ssDNA at two break sites induced by <italic>AsiSI</italic> digestion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">Fig. S5C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">5F</xref>), indicating that inhibition of CHK2 by IBC inhibits DSB end resection. Moreover, the extent of inhibition by IBC was similar to that caused by BML-277 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">Fig. S5C</xref>).</p>
<p>To analyze the consequences of CHK2 inhibition by IBC on HR, we assayed formation of RAD51 foci following induction of DSBs by ionizing radiation (8 Gy) or by bleomycin treatment. CHK2 inhibition by either IBC or BML-277 completely prevented formation of RAD51 foci in response to ionizing radiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5G</xref>) and IBC completely prevented formation of RAD51 foci in response to bleomycin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">Fig. S5D</xref>).

<p>To determine whether the tumor tissues had increased levels of RS or DNA damage when the mice were treated with IBC and BKC, we used immunohistochemistry to monitor cell proliferation (staining for Ki67) and checkpoint activation (staining for CHK1/CHK2 phosphorylation) and the TUNEL fluorescence assay for DNA fragmentation. Overall, IBC and BKC inhibited tumor cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14">Fig. S6B</xref>) and induced DNA fragmentation, indicative of tumor cell death by apoptosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14">Fig. S6B</xref>). Interestingly, IBC<sub>5x</sub> alone inhibited cell proliferation as efficiently as the IBC+BKC<sub>5x</sub> combination and better than Taxol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6B</xref>). However, the percentage of TUNEL-positive cells was much higher in mice treated with IBC+BKC<sub>5x</sub> than either drug alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6E</xref>), indicating that IBC and BKC have a strong synergistic effect on the induction of apoptosis and DNA breaks. We also observed a dose-dependent increase in CHK1 phosphorylation in tumor tissues from mice treated with BKC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6F</xref>), which is consistent with our observation above that BKC induced CHK1 activation <italic>in vitro</italic>. Moreover, BKC induced phosphorylation of CHK2 on T68, a marker of DNA damage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6G</xref>). However, this activation of CHK1 and CHK2 mediated by BKC was suppressed by the addition of IBC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6F</xref> and <bold>6G</bold>). Since these checkpoint kinases are important to coordinate DNA repair, this would explain why unrepairable DNA breaks accumulate in tumors exposed to the IBC+BKC<sub>5x</sub> combination. Interestingly, treatment with the higher concentration of IBC alone diminished the level of endogenous phosphorylation of both CHK1 and CHK2, which supports the view that IBC prevents the signaling of endogenous RS and DNA damage in tumors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6G</xref>). Altogether, our results show that IBC and BKC act synergistically to inhibit tumor growth <italic>in vivo</italic>, induce DNA fragmentation in the tumor and extend mice survival.</p>

<title>IBC potentiates the effect of chemotherapeutic agents on lymphoma cells</title>
<p>One current strategy for new cancer treatments is to inhibit cell cycle checkpoints at the same time as inducing DNA damage with conventional chemotherapeutic agents, thus driving cells to proliferate in the presence of DNA damage, ultimately resulting in their death. We showed above that IBC inhibits the DNA damage checkpoint kinase CHK2, therefore, we investigated whether IBC might enhance the potency of chemotherapeutic drugs. To this end, we used cell lines from patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL); this is the most common lymphoid malignancy in adults, accounting for up to 35% of non-Hodgkin lymphomas. Although DLBCL can be cured in over 60% of patients by using rituximab-based chemotherapy regimens, the remainder develop recurrent or progressive disease that is often fatal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Sarkozy &amp; Coiffier, 2013</xref>). New therapeutic approaches are still needed to achieve an effective treatment for these patients with high risk/refractory DLBCL. Since deregulation of DNA repair pathways in DLBCL cells is associated with a poor outcome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Bret <italic>et al</italic>, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Bret <italic>et al</italic>, 2013</xref>), we reasoned that IBC could potentiate the effect of agents inducing DNA damage in DLBCL cells.</p>
<p>To address this possibility, we first determined the IC<sub>50</sub> of IBC for growth inhibition of a panel of DLBCL cell lines. IC<sub>50</sub> ranged from 8–28 μM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7A</xref>), similar to the concentrations we found were effective on the solid cancer cell lines we tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">1C</xref>). To evaluate whether IBC potentiates the growth inhibitory effect of chemotherapeutic agents, we treated the drug-resistant DLBCL cell line U2932 with various concentrations of including etoposide, doxorubicin or 4-hydroxy-cyclophosphamide in the presence of the IC<sub>20</sub> of IBC (4.5 μM) for 72 hours. We found that IBC substantially enhanced cell growth inhibition by all three of these DNA damaging agents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7B</xref>). Moreover, by testing a full-range concentration matrix of drug pairs on cell viability after 72 h treatment, we found that IBC synergistically increased the inhibitory effect of doxorubicin and or 4-hydroxy-cyclophosphamide on U2932 cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15">Fig. S7</xref>), indicating that IBC is a promising candidate to potentiate the effect of these and potentially other conventional chemotherapeutic agents.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Approaches using small molecule inhibitors of cell cycle checkpoint kinases have shown promise as antitumor agents in preclinical studies, either when used alone or in combination with genotoxic agents that induce RS. However, clinical trials with these agents have been disappointing, showing only limited benefit to patients and significant side effects, particularly in combination therapies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Zhu <italic>et al</italic>., 2020</xref>). Here, we sought to identify novel small molecule inhibitors that sensitize cancer cells to RS but are not toxic to non-cancer cells. By screening a collection of plant extracts used in traditional Chinese medicine, we identified two known compounds, bakuchiol (BKC) and isobavachalcone (IBC), from <italic>Psoralea corylifolia</italic>, that synergistically inhibit proliferation of cancer cells. We show that BKC inhibits DNA replication, likely by binding to DNA polymerases, and that IBC prevents DNA end resection by inhibiting the checkpoint kinase CHK2. Together, these drugs induce replication stress and impede HR-mediated DSB repair. Consistent with these effects, we show that the drugs act synergistically to inhibit tumor development and extend survival rate in a xenograft mouse model. Moreover, IBC potentiates the inhibitory effect of conventional chemotherapeutic agents on lymphoma cell lines.</p>
<p>BKC is similar in structure to resveratrol and has been reported to exert a variety of pharmacological effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Xin <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>). In particular, BKC inhibits the proliferation of lung, breast, skin and stomach cancer cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Kim <italic>et al</italic>, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Li <italic>et al</italic>., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Lv &amp; Liu, 2017</xref>) and prevents replication of the polyomavirus SV40 <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Sun <italic>et al</italic>., 1998</xref>). This is consistent with our evidence from <italic>in silico</italic> molecular docking that BKC binds the catalytic site of DNA polymerases δ and ε. Thus, BKC probably inhibits the polymerases by competing for dNTP binding. Indeed, we demonstrate that BKC inhibits replication elongation of chromosomal DNA and ssDNA in <italic>Xenopus</italic> egg extracts, albeit to a lesser extent than does aphidicolin. These findings argue against the possible explanation that BKC inhibits dNTP synthesis, as proposed for the structurally similar compound resveratrol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Benslimane <italic>et al</italic>., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Fontecave <italic>et al</italic>., 1998</xref>), since dNTPs are available in large amount in these extracts. Moreover, we show that BKC slows replication fork progression <italic>in vivo</italic> in both normal and cancer cells, indicating that it acts as a <italic>bona fide</italic> replication inhibitor.</p>
<p>IBC affects a wide spectrum of biological functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Kuete &amp; Sandjo, 2012</xref>), including the activity of the NAD+-dependent deacetylase Sirtuin 2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Ren <italic>et al</italic>., 2024</xref>) and shows antitumor activity against drug-resistant cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Kuete <italic>et al</italic>., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Ren <italic>et al</italic>., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Wu <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>). IBC is thought to prevent cell proliferation and induce apoptosis in various cancer cell models by inhibiting the AKT kinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Jin &amp; Shi, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Jing <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>). In our hands, however, IBC does not significantly inhibit AKT, at least when the drug was used at concentrations that inhibit cell proliferation. Rather, IBC inhibits CHK2 <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> at concentrations an order of magnitude lower than those that inhibit other kinases and it has no effect on the activity of the related checkpoint kinase CHK1. As a key effector of the DNA damage response, CHK2 is an attractive target for new drugs that might potentiate the effect of conventional, DNA damaging treatments for cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Bucher &amp; Britten, 2008</xref>). However, few CHK2-specific inhibitors are available and those that are have only modest anti-proliferative effects when compared with inhibitors of other checkpoint kinases such as CHK1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Ronco <italic>et al</italic>, 2017</xref>). The results of clinical trials combining the CHK2 inhibitor PHI-101 with other therapeutic agents are still awaited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Park <italic>et al</italic>, 2022</xref>). Interestingly, CHK2 inhibitors also protects healthy tissues from radiotherapy or chemotherapy, presumably by inhibiting p53-dependent apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Jiang <italic>et al</italic>, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Xu <italic>et al</italic>, 2021</xref>).</p>
<p>The target of IBC <italic>in vivo</italic> is very likely CHK2-dependent activation of BRCA1. Indeed, we show that IBC prevents HR-mediated DSB repair by inhibiting the formation of RAD51 foci in cancer cells. The loading of RAD51 depends on the resection of DNA ends by nucleases, through a process that is mediated by the CHK2-dependent activation of BRCA1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Parameswaran <italic>et al</italic>., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Zhang <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>). We found that IBC inhibits resection at DSBs as efficiently as the CHK2 inhibitor BML-277. In contrast, IBC does not inhibit resection of nascent DNA at stalled forks, a process that does not depend on BRCA1 but, rather, is repressed by BRCA1 and BRCA2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Chen <italic>et al</italic>, 2018</xref>). Our data indicate therefore that IBC differentially affects resection at DSB and at stalled forks by inhibiting CHK2.</p>
<p>The inhibitory effects of BKC on DNA synthesis and IBC on DNA end resection support a model in which BKC increases RS in cancer cells by inhibiting bulk DNA synthesis, so increasing the rate of replication fork arrest/collapse and inducing RS-dependent DSBs, and IBC inhibits HR-mediated DSB repair, resulting in cell death by apoptosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8</xref>). This model explains why BKC and IBC synergistically inhibit the proliferation of cancer cells: BKC-mediated RS adds to oncogene-induced RS, explaining the differential sensitivity of normal and cancer cells to the combination of BKC and IBC, and also to the effects of IBC alone.</p>

</fig>
<p>In conclusion, our screening of traditional herbal medicine for novel combinations of small molecule inhibitors identified two compounds, BKC and IBC, acting synergistically to block cancer cell growth in different <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> contexts. Although it is unlikely that these compounds will ever be used in combination therapies, our results indicate that IBC or other clinically approved CHK2 inhibitors, could be used to potentiate the cytotoxic effect of known DNA damaging agents. This view is supported by our data showing that IBC potentiates the effect of etoposide, doxorubicin or 4-hydroxy-cyclophosphamide on drug-resistant lymphoma cell lines. Finally, recent evidence indicates that RS and DNA damage stimulate anti-tumor immunity by activating cytosolic nucleic acid-sensing pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Chabanon <italic>et al</italic>, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Tarsounas &amp; Sung, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Técher &amp; Pasero, 2021</xref>). New combinations of genotoxic agents and inhibitors targeting RS checkpoint kinases might thus be valuable also for potentiating immune checkpoint inhibitors.</p>

Similarly, to investigate the interaction between checkpoint kinase and IBC, IBC was docked into the active site of CHK1 (PDB code 5F4N) and CHK2 (PDB code 4BDK). The crystal structures of DNA polymerase and checkpoint kinase were downloaded from RCSB Protein Data Bank. The proteins and compound atoms were applied with CHARMm force field.</p>

<title>Animal study</title>
<p>Female NOD/SCID mice were National Laboratory Animal Center, Taiwan. All mice had free access to chow and water, and were housed at 21-23°C with 12 h light-12 h dark cycles. All mice were handled in accordance with the guidelines laid out by the Academia Sinica Institutional Animal Care and Utilization Committee (Protocol No. 10-12-097). To generate MCF tumor-bearing mice, MCF-7/Luc cells (1×10<sup>4</sup>) were subcutaneously inoculated into the fat pad of the mice as published (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Kuo <italic>et al</italic>, 2017</xref>). Eight groups of the mice received an intraperitoneal injection of PBS (Ctl), Taxol (5 mg/kg), IBC (0.3 and 1.5 mg/kg), BKC (1 and 5 mg/kg), and a combination of IBC and BKC (0.3 mg/kg IBC + 1 mg/kg BKC and 1.5 mg/kg IBC + 5 mg/kg BKC), thrice a week, from day 2 to 30 after tumor graft. The mice were daily measured for survival rate. Their tumor growth was weekly monitored using the IVIS system (Xenogen, USA). The signal of the bioluminescence from mice was quantified using Living Image 2.5 (Xenogen) as photons/sec/region of interest (ROI).</p>

<title>Immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis</title>
<p>Tumors were removed from mice 28 days post tumor inoculation. The tumors were fixed, dehydrated and embedded into paraffin. The tumor sections were stained with the antibody against Ki67, p-CHK1, and p-CHK2 and TUNEL kits. The signal of the sections was visualized and quantified by AxioVision software (Carl Zeiss MicroImaging).</p>

<p>This study presents <bold>important</bold> findings on the activity of two compounds, BKC and IBC, isolated from Psoralea corylifolia, which act synergistically to inhibit cancer cell proliferation. Using a spectrum of methods, the authors characterized the mechanisms of action of both drugs, providing <bold>convincing</bold> evidence that BKC targets DNA polymerases and IBC selectively inhibits CHK2. The study opens the possibility of improving the effectiveness of the combination of BKC and other damaging agents with IBC in cancer treatment.</p>

<p>The manuscript by Coquel et al. investigates the effects of BKC and IBC, two compounds found in Psoralea corylifolia in DNA replication and the response to DNA damage, and explores their potential use in cancer treatment. These compounds have been previously shown to affect different cellular pathways and the authors use transformed cancer cells of different origins and a non-transformed cell line to question if their combination is toxic in cancer versus non-cancer cells. They propose that BKC inhibits DNA polymerases while IBC targets CHK2. Their results show that both compounds do affect DNA replication, inducing replication stress and affecting double strand break repair. They also show that their combined use increases their toxicity in a synergistic manner.</p>
<p>Comments on current version:</p>
<p>The authors have addressed the main questions raised in the original manuscript. The new data provide stronger evidence supporting the inhibition of DNA polymerases by BKC and the effect of IBC on CHK2. In addition, the new data provides information about the potential mechanism of action of IBC in cells and xenograft models. Together, the revised manuscript has notably increased the relevance and impact of the results with stronger conclusions and better controlled experiments.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The manuscript: &quot;Synergistic effect of inhibiting CHK2 and DNA replication on cancer cell growth&quot; successfully demonstrates that the compounds BKC and IBC found in Psoralea corylifolia act synergistically to inhibit cancer cell proliferation, using a wide range of well-chosen methodologies. Moreover, the authors characterized the mechanisms of action of both drugs, which result in inhibition of cell proliferation. The use of multiple cell lines and the mice models makes the study robust and complete.</p>
<p>Significance:</p>
<p>The manuscript presents a well written study that offers new insights and contributions to the field. Although the inhibitors described have been known in science, the authors present convincingly their mode of action, which is either better characterized (for BKC) or inhibiting a different than previously suggested enzyme (for IBC). Authors also nicely pinpoint and explain the narrow window of concentrations when these two compounds act synergistically rather than additively. The analyses in multiple cell lines, mouse models and in combination with other cancer treatments, make this study of interest not only for fundamental researchers but also for translational scientists and industry.</p>

<p><bold>(1) General Statements</bold></p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank all three reviewers for their constructive comments and suggestions. We also thank reviewers #2 and #3 for considering our work to be timely and of interest to the field, not only for basic researchers, but also for translational scientists and industry. We are now providing additional results to further support our hypothesis and hope that all reviewers will find that our manuscript is now ready for publication.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>(2) Point-by-point description of the revisions</bold></p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Evidence, reproducibility and clarity (Required)):</bold></p>
<p>The manuscript by Coquel et al. investigates the effects of BKC and IBC, two compounds found in Psoralea corylifolia in DNA replication and the response to DNA damage, and explores their potential use in cancer treatment. These compounds have been previously shown to affect different cellular pathways and the authors use transformed cancer cells of different origins and a non-transformed cell line to question if their combination is toxic in cancer versus non-cancer cells. They propose that BKC inhibits DNA polymerases while IBC targets CHK2. Their results show that both compounds do affect DNA replication, inducing replication stress and affecting double strand break repair. They also show that their combined use increases their toxicity in a synergistic manner.</p>
<p>However, there are some major conclusions that are still not very well supported by the data: first, the differential effect on cancer and non-transformed cells; second, the direct link of BKC to the inhibition of DNA polymerases; and third, it is unclear if CHK2 is the relevant target for IBC in this context.</p>
<p>Regarding these points the authors should address the following issues:</p>
<p>(1) Most of the experiments use BJ fibroblasts as a control cell line. In order to evaluate if these compounds are preferentially toxic for cancer cells, the use of more than one non-transformed cell line is necessary. In addition, BJ cells are fibroblasts while most of the cancer cell lines employed are of epithelial origin. The authors could use MCF10 and RPE cells (both of epithelial origin) as control cell lines to complement the results and better support this claim.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have now monitored the effect of IBC and BKC on the proliferation of MCF-7, MCF-10A and RPE-1 cells using the WST-1 assay and obtained similar results as for BJ and MCF-7 cells. These results are now included in the revised manuscript as Fig. S1A and S1B.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) In order to explore what are the targets of BKC and IBC Cellular Thermal Shift Assays (CETSA) could be used. Either by doing an unbiased mass spectrometry analysis of proteins stabilized by these compounds or by a direct analysis of candidate proteins by western blot (a similar approach has been used for IBC to show that it inhibits SIRT2 in Ren et al., 2024 Phytotherapy Res).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank this Reviewer for suggesting the use of the CETSA assay. We have now performed  CETSA on MCF-7 cells and found that IBC stabilizes CHK2 but not CHK1, to the same extent as the commercial CHK2 inhibitor BML-277 used here as a positive control. These results are now shown in new Fig. 4G and 4H.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) For BKC in vitro polymerase assays could be carried out to show the direct inhibition of the DNA polymerase delta, for instance.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have used high-speed <italic>Xenopus</italic> egg extracts to replicate ssDNA <italic>in vitro</italic> (Fig. S2C). This assay differs from the <italic>in vitro</italic> replication assay using low-speed <italic>Xenopus</italic> egg extracts (Fig. 2H) in that it only monitors elongation by replicative DNA polymerases (Pol δ and ε) and not earlier steps such as origin licensing and activation. The combined use of both low-speed and highspeed extracts strongly supports the view that BKC inhibits replicative DNA polymerases.</p>
<p>To confirm this result, we have also used CETSA to monitor BKC binding to different subunits of DNA Polδ and Polε in MCF-7 cells and in <italic>Xenopus</italic> egg extracts (Fig. 3C-D Fig. S3). We found that BKC binds POLD1 and POLE, the catalytic subunits of Pol δ and ε respectively, but not the accessory subunit POLD3 nor PCNA. Together with our docking results and DNA fiber experiments, these data strongly support the view that BKC is a potent inhibitor of DNA Pol and Pol.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) In addition, the authors could analyze the integrity of replication forks by PCNA immunofluorescence analysis. The colocalization of PCNA and POLD or POLE subunits could also support the role of DNA polymerases as targets of BKC.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Our molecular docking results also show that BKC occupies the catalytic sites of DNA Pol δ and ε, which may not affect their subcellular localization and/or PCNA binding. Since our DNA replication assays, CETSA and DNA fiber analyses strongly support the view that BKC inhibits replicative DNA polymerases, we have not performed this additional experiment.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) In the case of IBC and the inhibition of CHK2, the authors should check the effect of IBC on the phosphorylation of BRCA1 on S988. The changes in CHK2 phosphorylation in Figure 3B are not convincing. The experiment should be repeated and the average of at least three experiments needs to be quantified.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We now provide evidence that IBC inhibits BRCA1 phosphorylation on S988. Western blots and quantification for three biological replicates are shown in Fig. 4C and Fig. S4H. Densitometric quantification of CHK2 phosphorylation on S516 from 3 biological replicates, along with statistical analysis, is now shown in Fig. S4G.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(6) To prove that CHK2 is the relevant target for IBC the authors could test if ATM and CHK2 knockout cells are more resistant to this compound, since it would prevent the phosphorylation of CHK2.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have performed siRNA transfection targeting CHK2. The transfected cells died after 72 hours in culture, so we have been unable to determine whether CHK2-KD cells have increased resistance to IBC.</p>
<p>In addition to these experiments, I would suggest some other major improvements in the manuscript:</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(1) The concentration of both compounds should be provided in molar units throughout the paper.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks for pointing this out, we now use molar units throughout the paper.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) The authors do not clearly indicate the concentration that is employed in the different experiments, making it difficult to assess the results. For instance, Figure 2 does not include the concentration in the legend or in the text. Time and concentration need to be clearly shown for each experiment.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The experimental conditions and inhibitor concentrations are now clearly indicated for each experiment.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) Some experiments are only repeated once (fiber assays) or twice (cell cycle analysis by flow cytometry). These experiments need to be repeated 3 times and the proper statistical analysis performed (comparison of the medians).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Superplots with biological replicates for all DNA fiber assays are now displayed. The number of biological replicates is now indicated in the legends and appropriate statistical analyses are used.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Other minor points or suggestions:</p>
<p>(1) Analyzing fork asymmetry would further support the direct effect of BKC on DNA polymerases.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The effect of BKC on fork asymmetry is now shown in Fig. 2F.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) A dose dependent analysis of BKC on the speed of DNA replication would also support this point.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Superplots of DNA fiber assays showing the effect of different concentrations of BKC on fork speed from three biological replicates are now included in Fig. 2E.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) Page 7: BKC reduces fork speed ...two-fold. This sentence is not very clear, it would be better to say that speed is half of the control.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This sentence was changed to “BKC reduced fork speed by a factor of two relative to untreated cells”.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) Figure 4G and S4D show contradictory results regarding the induction of Rad51 foci by IBC treatment. This needs to be clarified.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Figure 4G and S4D (now Fig. 5G and S5D) do not show contradictory results. In both cases, IBC treatment impaired the induction of RAD51 foci by IR or bleomycin.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Significance):</bold></p>
<p>The work by Coquel et al. aims at elucidating the use of BKC and IBC as a combined therapy to induce cell death in cancer cells by targeting DNA replication and CHK2. Both BKC and IBC have been previously shown to affect the proliferation of cancer cells. BKC has been shown to induce S phase arrest in an ATR dependent manner in MCF7 cells (Li et al., 2016 Front Pharm), while IBC induces cell death in MDA-MB-231 cells (Wu et al., 2022 Molecules). In this regard, the more interesting contribution of the manuscript is the potential identification of the targets of these compounds in cancer cells. The inhibition of CHK2 by IBC is quite compelling although it needs to be further proven. In contrast, the hypothesis that BKC inhibits DNA polymerases remains highly speculative. The results offer a limited advance in the knowledge of the mechanism of action of these two compounds. Focusing on the action of IBC on CHK2 would increase the impact of the results. In this sense a very recent report has been published showing that IBC inhibits SIRT2 (Ren et al., 2024 Phyto Res), showing that IBC can affect multiple enzymes and processes. This should be taken into account for a further analysis of its mechanism of action.</p>
<p>In addition to the identification of the targets of BKC and IBC, the authors also focus on their combination for cancer treatment. This is based on the idea that blocking the DSB repair and inducing replication stress at the same time is an efficient approach to induce cancer cell death. This is not a new concept, since the loss of ATM sensitizes cancer cells to the inhibition of the replication stress response and several combination therapies have been put forward with the idea of generating replication stress and preventing the subsequent repair of the double strand breaks induced in these cells. Thus, the novelty here is limited, especially considering that the effect of BKC on DNA replication has already been described. Further, since its mechanism of action is unclear, it is difficult to ascribe the observed synergy to the speculated hypothesis. A deeper analysis of IBC as a CHK2 inhibitor would be more interesting, and the potential combination with other chemotherapy agents such as replication stress inhibitors, HU or DNA damaging agents. Also, the lack of a good control of non-transformed cells also reduces the relevance of the work.</p>
<p>In its current state, the interest of the manuscript is limited. The mechanistical advance is not strong enough and is not completely supported by the data, and the use of these compounds as a combination therapy does not provide new insights in cancer treatment. In my opinion, focusing on the inhibition of CHK2 by IBC and its potential use would broaden the impact of the results beyond the mere analysis of the action of these compounds.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank this reviewer for his/her constructive and insightful comments. We have followed his/her advice and focused our analysis on the action of IBC on CHK2. Using CETSA, we confirmed that IBC binds CHK2 to the same extent as BML-277 inhibitor, but does not bind CHK1. We also show that IBC inhibits BRCA1 phosphorylation on S988 and CHK2 phosphorylation on S516. Together with the results presented in the initial version of the manuscript, these data support the view that CHK2 is a key IBC target. We have also applied CETSA to DNA polymerases and confirmed that BKC directly targets DNA Polδ and ε. Although it is unlikely that IBC and BKC will ever be used in combination therapies, the synergistic effect that we measured on cancer cells <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> indicates that IBC sensitizes cancer cells to endogenous replication stress and to exogenous sources of DNA damage, which could be used to replace BKC in combination therapies. For instance, our data indicate that IBC can be used in combination with drugs such as etoposide, doxorubicin or cyclophosphamide to potentiate their effect on drug-resistant lymphoma cell lines (DLBCL). As requested by this Reviewer, we have modified the discussion section to put more emphasis on IBC and CHK2 inhibitors and we hope that he/she will now find this revised version suitable for publication.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Evidence, reproducibility and clarity):</bold></p>
<p>In the manuscript by Coquel et al., the authors report their findings on the effect of 2 natural compounds from Psoralea corylofolia plant extracts on cancer cells. They show that these compounds, bakuchiol (BKC) and isobavachalcone (IBC), inhibit proliferation of cancer cells and tumor development in xenografted mice, particularly when used in combination. They further show that BKC inhibited DNA polymerases and induced replication stress, and show evidence that IBC inhibits Chk2 kinase activity and downstream double-strand break repair. Based on their findings, the authors conclude that Chk2 inhibition and DNA replication inhibition represent a potential synergistic strategy to selecting target cancer cells.</p>
<p>Major:</p>
<p>(1) The data showing IBC is a Chk2 inhibitor is weak and more rigorous investigation is needed to establish this compound as a Chk2 inhibitor.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As indicate in our response to Reviewer #1, we have now analyzed the binding of IBC to CHK2 using the Cellular Thermal Shift Assay (CETSA) in MCF-7 cells. Our data clearly show that IBC binds to CHK2 but not CHK1. These results are now shown in Fig. 4G and 4H.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>For one, the authors mention they screened 43 cell cycle-related kinases in vitro, but only show data for 8 kinases in their kinase activity screens. Of these 8 kinases, Chk2 is the most strongly inhibited, but there are no data shown for the other 35 kinases.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Data for all the protein kinases tested in the <italic>in vitro</italic> assay are now presented in Fig. S4D and S4E.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Additionally, the purpose of the CHK2 mutants should be discussed in the text.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The CHK2(I157T) mutation is linked to an increased risk of breast and colorectal cancers. CHK2(R145W) is associated with Li-Fraumeni Syndrome. Both mutations do not affect the basal kinase activity of CHK2. This information is now indicated in the legend of Fig. S4D.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Secondly, the western blot in Fig 3B, appears to show a very modest effect of IBC on Chk2 autophosphorylation and not that different from the effect of IBC on Akt phosphorylation in Fig S3a. Yet, the authors claim that IBC inhibits Chk2 but not Akt. To strengthen these blots, a known Chk2 inhibitor, such as the one shown in Fig 4 (BML-277) should be included as a positive control for pChk2 similarly to what was shown for Akt with MK-2206.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have now replaced the western blot in Fig. 3B (now Fig. 4B) with another biological replicate. Quantifications and statistical analyses of biological replicates are shown in Fig. S4G. Overall, we observed a 50% reduction of CHK2 auto-phosphorylation in MCF7 cells treated with IBC, and a 20% reduction in AKT phosphorylation (Fig. S4A). There was no additional reduction in AKT phosphorylation when cells were treated with IBC in combination with MK-2206, compared to cells treated with MK-2206 alone. We now include the CHK2 inhibitor BML-277 as a positive control alongside with IBC to monitor CHK2 and CHK1 auto-phosphorylation in Fig. 4B, S4G, 4D and S4I, respectively.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Western blots showing a loss of phosphorylation of additional Chk2 targets is also needed. The manuscript mentions Brca1 S988 as a Chk2 substrate important for DSB repair. Showing the effect of IBC on this phosphorylation site would strengthen the conclusions.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We now provide evidence that IBC inhibits BRCA1 phosphorylation at S988. Western blots and quantification for three biological replicates are shown in Fig. 4C and S4H.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) The authors claim that the combination of IBC and BKC inhibit cell growth in a synergistic manner and that the &quot;effect is more pronounce on cancer cells than on non-cancer cells.&quot; However, only 1 non-malignant cell line was used, and it was a fibroblast line. To make this claim, the authors need to show the effect in additional non-malignant cells, preferably with epithelial cell types.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have now monitored cell proliferation using the WST-1 assay in two additional non-malignant cell lines, namely MCF-10A and RPE-1 cells. Cells were treated with IBC/BKC and their growth was compared to that of MCF-7 cells. These experiments yielded similar results to those obtained with BJ fibroblasts. These new data are now included in the revised version as Fig. S1A and S1B.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Minor:</p>
<p>(1) Densitometry data for all western blots should be shown with mean+/- stdev of independent western blots.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Densitometry data for all western blots with biological replicates are now shown in supplementary figures.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) In Figure 1B the statistical test used to analyze cell number was not stated.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The statistical test is now indicated in Fig. 1B.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) In Figure 2A, the DAPI image for BKC is the merged image and should be replaced with just DAPI.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This error has now been corrected.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) In Figure 2B, the y-axis label says &quot;yH2AX foci (MFI)&quot;. MFI and foci are not the same thing, and for yH2AX, the signal is often not focal. MFI of yH2AX is an appropriate measurement for replication stress, it's just not appropriate to equate MFI to foci.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We apologize for this labeling error, which has now been corrected.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) For the 53BP1 MFI and Rad51 MFI shown in Fig 4 and Fig S4, it is more appropriate to show the number of foci/cell as these are better indicators of breaks and repair sites. MFI is influenced by expression levels of the proteins and not necessarily the break/repair.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The numbers of 53BP1 and RAD51 foci are now shown.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(6) The data in Figures 5B and 5C are very difficult to read. Perhaps color-coat the lines/symbols.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have now colored the graph to increase its readability.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Significance):</bold></p>
<p>The findings reported in this manuscript are timely, of interest to the field, and are mostly wellsupported by the experimental data. However, there are a few concerns that need to be addressed.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We are grateful to Reviewer #2 for his positive assessment of our manuscript. We hope that we have adequately addressed all of his/her specific concerns and that he/she will agree with the need to put more emphasis on IBC and CHK2 inhibition as requested by Reviewer #1.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Evidence, reproducibility and clarity):</bold></p>
<p>The manuscript: &quot;Synergistic effect of inhibiting CHK2 and DNA replication on cancer cell growth&quot; successfully demonstrates that the compounds BKC and IBC found in Psoralea corylifolia act synergistically to inhibit cancer cell proliferation, using a wide range of well-chosen methodologies. Moreover, the authors characterized the mechanisms of action of both drugs, which result in inhibition of cell proliferation. The use of multiple cell lines and the mice models makes the study robust and complete. The manuscript presents a well written study that offers new insights and contributions to the field.</p>
<p>A few suggestions to improve the study:</p>
<p>(1) Given that both compounds BKC and IBC have already been previously described in the literature, it would be helpful for the reader to have them described better at the beginning of the study.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks for pointing this out. We have now better described BKC and IBC at the beginning of the results section, as well as in the discussion. We agree that this could be helpful to readers.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) Addition of western blot quantifications over the number of experimental repeats is important specifically for Fig. 2C and Fig. 3C where partial effect of treatment on a signal level is reported.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The densitometry analysis of data shown in Fig. 2C and biological replicates are now shown in Fig. S2B. Quantification for Fig. 3C (now Fig. 4D) is shown in Fig. S4I.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) The quantification of mean intensity for 53BP1 and RAD51 foci should be exchanged with the quantification of number of foci per cell. While the quantification of gH2AX signal intensity is a correct representation of induction of this signal upon damage, foci formed by protein recruitment to DNA damage sites should be quantified by counting the number of foci, rather than signal in the whole cell/nucleus. These proteins exist before damage and are re-located in response to the damage.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Quantification of 53BP1 and RAD51 foci is now expressed as the number of foci per cell.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) Materials &amp; Methods section is missing the methods for the experiment described in Fig. 1B. In summary, after addressing our few concerns, we believe the manuscript should be accepted for publication.</p>

<p>The WST-1 assay used for cell number quantification is included in “Reagents” in Material &amp; Methods section.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Significance):</bold></p>
<p>The manuscript presents a well written study that offers new insights and contributions to the field. Although the inhibitors described have been known in science, the authors present convincingly their mode of action, which is either better characterized (for BKC) or inhibiting a different than previously suggested enzyme (for IBC). Authors also nicely pinpoint and explain the narrow window of concentrations when these two compounds act synergistically rather than additively. The analyses in multiple cell lines, mouse models and in combination with other cancer treatments, makes this study of interest not only for fundamental researchers but also for translational scientists and industry.</p>
