<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Flagella are important for bacterial motility as well as for pathogenesis. Synthesis of these structures is energy intensive and, while extensive transcriptional regulation has been described, little is known about the posttranscriptional regulation. Small RNAs (sRNAs) are widespread posttranscriptional regulators, most base pairing with mRNAs to affect their stability and/or translation. Here we describe four UTR-derived sRNAs (UhpU, MotR, FliX and FlgO) whose expression is controlled by the flagella sigma factor σ<sup>28</sup> (<italic>fliA</italic>) in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>. Interestingly, the four sRNAs have varied effects on flagellin protein levels, flagella number and cell motility. UhpU, corresponding to the 3’ UTR of a metabolic gene, likely has hundreds of targets including a transcriptional regulator at the top flagella regulatory cascade connecting metabolism and flagella synthesis. Unlike most sRNAs, MotR and FliX base pair within the coding sequences of target mRNAs and uniquely act on ribosomal protein mRNAs connecting ribosome production and flagella synthesis. The study shows how sRNA-mediated regulation can overlay a complex network enabling nuanced control of flagella synthesis.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Most bacteria are motile and can swim through liquid and semiliquid environments in large part driven by the flagellum. The highly complex bacterial flagellum consists of three major domains: an ion-driven motor, which can provide torque in either direction; a universal joint called the hook-basal body, which transmits motor torque; and a 20 nm thick hollow filament tube composed of the flagellin subunit, which acts as a propeller (reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Altegoer &amp; Bange, 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Nakamura &amp; Minamino, 2019</xref>)). The flagellum structure is comprised of many proteins, and the flagellar regulon encompasses more than 50 genes. Since it is estimated that one flagellum constitutes ∼2% of the total protein in the cell, synthesis is a costly process requiring extensive use of ribosomes (reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Soutourina &amp; Bertin, 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Guttenplan &amp; Kearns, 2013</xref>)).</p>
<p>To ensure that flagellar components are made in the order in which they are needed, transcription of the genes in the regulon is activated in a sequential manner in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Kalir <italic>et al</italic>., 2001</xref>) and <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> (reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Chevance &amp; Hughes, 2008</xref>)). The genes can be divided into three groups based on their time of activation: early genes, middle genes, and late genes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>). The FlhDC transcription regulators, encoded by the two early genes, activate the transcription of the middle genes, which are required for the hook-basal body. FlhDC also activates transcription of <italic>fliA</italic>, encoding sigma factor σ<sup>28</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Fitzgerald <italic>et al</italic>., 2014</xref>). σ<sup>28</sup> in turn activates transcription of the late genes responsible for completing the flagellum and the chemotaxis system. σ<sup>28</sup> additionally increases expression of several of the middle genes. σ<sup>28</sup> activity itself is negatively regulated by the anti-sigma factor, FlgM, which is transported out of the cell when the hook-basal body complex is complete (reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Smith &amp; Hoover, 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Osterman <italic>et al</italic>., 2015</xref>). Given the numerous components required at different times and different stoichiometries during flagellum assembly, various factors can be rate limiting under specific conditions (reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Chevance &amp; Hughes, 2008</xref>)). The dependence of flagella synthesis on FlhDC and σ<sup>28</sup> generates a coherent feed-forward loop. In this loop, the first regulator (FlhDC) activates the second regulator (σ<sup>28</sup>), and they both additively activate their target genes. This results in prolonged flagellar expression, protecting the flagella synthesis from a transient loss of input signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Kalir <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>).</p>

<p>A Overview of the flagellar regulon. The early genes initiate the transcription of the middle genes, including <italic>fliA</italic> which encodes σ<sup>28</sup>. In turn, σ<sup>28</sup> initiates the transcription of the late genes and enhances the transcription of some of the middle genes. For the middle and late genes, only selected operons are shown.

<p>Given flagella are so costly to produce, synthesis is tightly regulated such that flagellar components are only made when motility is beneficial. Thus, flagellar synthesis is strongly impacted by environmental signals. For instance, flagellar gene expression is decreased in the presence of D-glucose, in high temperatures, high salt, and extreme pH, as well as the presence of DNA gyrase inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Shi <italic>et al</italic>., 1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Adler &amp; Templeton, 1967</xref>). The flagellar genes are activated under oxygen-limited conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Landini &amp; Zehnder, 2002</xref>) and at various stages of infection (reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Erhardt, 2016</xref>)). Consequently, transcription of many genes in the flagellar regulon is regulated in response to a range of environmental signals. For example, transcription of <italic>flhDC</italic> is controlled by at least 13 transcription factors, each of them active under different conditions (reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Prüß, 2017</xref>)).</p>
<p>While the activation of flagella synthesis has been examined in some detail, there has been less investigation into the termination of synthesis, which we presume is equally important for the conservation of resources. Additionally, while transcriptional regulation of flagella genes has been studied for many years, less is known about the post-transcriptional control of the regulon. Small RNAs (sRNAs) that can originate from many different genetic loci (reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Adams &amp; Storz, 2020</xref>)) are key post-transcriptional regulators in bacteria. They usually regulate their targets in trans via limited base-pairing, affecting translation and/or mRNA stability (reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Hör <italic>et al</italic>., 2020</xref>)). Many characterized sRNAs are stabilized and their base pairing with targets increased by RNA chaperones, of which the hexameric, ring-shaped Hfq protein has been studied most extensively (reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Updegrove <italic>et al</italic>., 2016</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Holmqvist &amp; Vogel, 2018</xref>)). The only post-transcriptional control by base pairing sRNAs described for the <italic>E. coli</italic> flagellar regulon thus far is negative regulation of <italic>flhDC</italic> by ArcZ, OmrA, OmrB and OxyS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">De Lay &amp; Gottesman, 2012</xref>) and positive regulation of the same mRNA by McaS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Thomason <italic>et al</italic>., 2012</xref>). These sRNAs and a few other sRNAs also were shown to affect motility and biofilm formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Bak <italic>et al</italic>., 2015</xref>).</p>
<p>Herein we characterize four σ<sup>28</sup>-dependent sRNAs, which were detected with their targets on Hfq through RIL-seq methodology that captures the sRNA-target interactome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Melamed <italic>et al</italic>., 2016</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Melamed <italic>et al</italic>., 2020</xref>). These sRNAs originate from the untranslated regions (UTRs) of mRNAs, three of which belong to the flagellar regulon. We identified a wide range of targets for the sRNAs, including genes related to flagella and ribosome synthesis and observed that the sRNAs act on some of these targets by unique modes of action. We show that three of these sRNAs regulate flagella number and bacterial motility, possibly imposing temporal control on flagella synthesis and integrating metabolic signals into this complex regulatory network.</p>

<title>σ28-dependent sRNAs are expressed sequentially in log phase cells</title>
<p>Analysis of several different RNA-seq data sets suggested the expression of four σ<sup>28</sup>-dependent sRNAs in <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Melamed <italic>et al</italic>., 2016</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Fitzgerald <italic>et al</italic>., 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Thomason <italic>et al</italic>., 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Melamed <italic>et al</italic>., 2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Bar <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>). These sRNAs originate from the UTRs of protein coding genes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref> and S1A). UhpU corresponds to the 3’ UTR of <italic>uhpT</italic>, which encodes a hexose phosphate transporter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Marger &amp; Saier, 1993</xref>). UhpU is transcribed from its own promoter inside the coding sequence (CDS) of <italic>uhpT</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Thomason <italic>et al</italic>., 2015</xref>). The other three σ<sup>28</sup>-dependent sRNAs correspond to the UTRs of the late genes in the flagellar regulon. MotR originates from the 5’ UTR of <italic>motA</italic>, which encodes part of the flagellar motor complex. Based on previous transcription start site analysis, the promoter for <italic>motR</italic> is within the <italic>flhC</italic> CDS and is also the promoter of the downstream <italic>motAB-cheAW</italic> operon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Thomason <italic>et al</italic>., 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Fitzgerald <italic>et al</italic>., 2014</xref>). FliX originates from the 3’ UTR of <italic>fliC,</italic> which encodes flagellin, the core component of the flagellar filament (reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Thomson <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>)). FlgO originates from the 3’ UTR of <italic>flgL</italic>, a gene that encodes a junction protein shown to connect the flagella to the hook in <italic>S. enterica</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Ikeda <italic>et al</italic>., 1987</xref>). The observation that FliX and FlgO levels decline substantially in RNA-seq libraries treated with 5’ phosphate-dependent exonuclease to deplete processed RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Thomason <italic>et al</italic>., 2015</xref>), indicates that both of these sRNAs are processed from their parental mRNAs.</p>
<p>Northern blot analysis confirmed σ<sup>28</sup>-dependent synthesis of these sRNAs since expression was significantly decreased in a mutant lacking σ<sup>28</sup> (Δ<italic>fliA</italic>) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1C</xref>). Given that most σ<sup>28</sup>-dependent mRNAs encode flagella components, the σ<sup>28</sup> regulation suggests the sRNAs impact flagella synthesis. The northern analysis also showed that the levels of the four σ<sup>28</sup>-dependent sRNAs are highest in the transition from mid-exponential to stationary phase growth, though there are some differences with UhpU and MotR peaking before FliX and FlgO (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1C</xref> and S2). Since flagellar components are expressed at precise times, the difference in the UhpU and MotR peak times compared to the FliX and FlgO peak times hints at different roles for each of these sRNAs. For UhpU, two predominant bands were observed, a long transcript and a shorter transcript processed from UhpU (denoted UhpU-S), which corresponds to the higher peak in the sequencing data (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref>). One prominent band was detected for MotR and for FliX, while a doublet was observed for FlgO. Additional higher bands detected by the MotR probe could be explained by RNA polymerase read through of the MotR terminator into the downstream <italic>motAB-cheAW</italic> operon, while the additional bands seen for FliX could be explained by alternative processing of the <italic>fliC</italic> mRNA.</p>
<p>We also examined the levels of the four sRNAs in minimal media (M63) supplemented with different carbon sources (Fig S1B). Generally, the sRNAs levels in minimal medium are comparable to their levels in rich media (LB) except medium with glucose 6-phosphate (G6P), where the levels of UhpU-S are elevated while the levels of full-length UhpU transcript and the other σ<sup>28</sup>-dependent sRNAs are decreased. These observations suggest an alternative means for UhpU-S generation from the <italic>uhpT</italic> mRNA known to be induced by G6P (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Verhamme <italic>et al</italic>., 2001</xref>). We also observe more FliX products, particularly for cells grown in minimal medium with ribose or galactose.</p>
<p>The predicted structures for the four σ<sup>28</sup>-dependent sRNAs (Fig S1C), with strong stem-loops at the 3’ ends, are consistent with the structures of known Hfq-binding sRNAs and the association with Hfq observed in the RIL-seq data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Melamed <italic>et al</italic>., 2016</xref>). To confirm Hfq binding, we probed RNA that co-immunoprecipitated with Hfq (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1D</xref>). Strong enrichment and fewer background bands were observed for all of the sRNAs; ∼260 nt and ∼60 nt bands for UhpU and UhpU-S, respectively, a ∼95 nt band for MotR, a ∼200 nt band for FliX and a doublet of ∼75 nt bands for FlgO. For FliX, we also detected a second ∼100 nt FliX band (denoted FliX-S; Fig S1A) that corresponds to the 3’ peak in the sequencing data (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref>) and includes one of the REP sequences downstream of <italic>fliC</italic>.</p>

<title>σ28-dependent sRNAs impact flagella number and bacterial motility</title>
<p>To begin to decipher the roles of the four σ<sup>28</sup>-dependent sRNAs, we constructed plasmids for overexpression of the sRNAs (Fig S3A). Given that it was challenging to obtain constructs constitutively overexpressing UhpU because all clones had mutations, this sRNA could only be expressed from a plasmid with a IPTG-inducible Plac promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Guo <italic>et al</italic>., 2014</xref>). The other sRNAs were expressed from a plasmid with the constitutive P<sub>LlacO-1</sub> promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Urban &amp; Vogel, 2007</xref>). We also obtained a plasmid constitutively overexpressing MotR*, a more abundant derivative of MotR identified by chance (TGC at positions 6-8 mutated to GAG; Fig S1A).</p>
<p>We tested the effects of overexpressing the sRNAs on flagellar synthesis by determining the number of flagella by electron microscopy and on bacterial motility by assaying the spread of cells on 0.3% agar plates. The WT <italic>E. coli</italic> strain used throughout the paper is highly motile due to an IS1 insertion in the <italic>crl</italic> gene, thus eliminating expression of a protein that promotes σ<sup>S</sup> binding to the RNA polymerase core enzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Typas <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>), and resulting in higher expression of the flagellar regulatory cascade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Pesavento <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>). However, we also assayed a less motile strain with the restored <italic>crl</italic><sup>+</sup> gene for UhpU and MotR effects on motility, given that no effects were observed with the highly motile <italic>crl</italic><sup>-</sup> strain.</p>
<p>Intriguingly, overexpression of the individual sRNAs had different consequences. UhpU overexpression caused a slight increase in flagella number (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A</xref>) and a marked increase in motility (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2B</xref>). Overexpression of MotR, particularly MotR*, led to a dramatic increase in the flagella number (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2C</xref> and S4A) and MotR but not MotR* had a slight effect on motility (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2D</xref> and S4B). It has been suggested that the run/tumble behavior of bacteria, which affect their swimming, is only weakly dependent on number of flagella (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Mears <italic>et al</italic>., 2014</xref>), possibly explaining these somewhat contradictory effects on flagella number compared to motility. In contrast to UhpU and MotR, FliX overexpression led to a reduction in the number of flagella (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2E</xref>), an effect that was even more pronounced in a strain overexpressing FliX-S (Fig S4C). Overexpression of FliX-S but not FliX also reduced bacterial motility (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2F</xref> and S4D). While FliX-S overexpression seems to lead to aflagellated bacteria, we hypothesize that the sRNA is delaying but not eliminating flagella gene expression, explaining why the bacteria are still moderately motile. Some motility phenotypes can be explained by differences in growth rate, but we do not think that this is the case for MotR and FliX as we observed only slight effects on growth upon MotR, MotR*, FliX and FliX-S overexpression (Fig S3B). FlgO overexpression did not result in a detectable change in flagella number or motility (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2G</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2H</xref>). Together, these results show that the σ<sup>28</sup>-dependent sRNAs have a range of effects on the number of flagella and motility, with UhpU and MotR, which are expressed first, increasing both phenotypes and FliX, which is expressed later, decreasing both. Given that MotR* and FliX-S have stronger effects for some phenotypes, these derivatives were included in some subsequent assays.</p>

<title>σ28-dependent sRNAs have wide range of potential targets based on RIL-seq analysis</title>
<p>To understand the phenotypes associated with overexpression of the σ<sup>28</sup>-dependent sRNAs expression, we took advantage of the sRNA-target interactome data obtained by RIL-seq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Melamed <italic>et al</italic>., 2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Melamed <italic>et al</italic>., 2016</xref>). We analyzed RIL-seq data generated from 18 samples representing six different growth conditions (Table S1). The sRNAs differ significantly in their target sets (Fig S5). In general, UhpU is a hub with hundreds of RIL-seq targets. Its target set comprises a wide range of genes, including multiple genes that have roles in flagella synthesis and carbon metabolism. MotR and FliX were associated with fewer targets, but uniquely, both sets were enriched for genes encoding ribosomal proteins. Interestingly, the <italic>fliC</italic> gene encoding flagellin was present in the target sets for UhpU, MotR, and FliX. Although FlgO is one of the most strongly enriched sRNAs upon Hfq purification (ranked fourth in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Melamed et al., 2020</xref>), it had the smallest set of targets, and almost none of the targets were found in more than two conditions, hinting FlgO might not act as a conventional Hfq-dependent base-pairing sRNA. Unlike for most characterized sRNA targets, the RIL-seq signal for the sRNA interactions with <italic>fliC</italic> and the ribosomal protein genes is internal to the CDSs (Table S1). Before turning our attention to these unique targets, we first examined the UhpU interaction with a canonical target.</p>

<p>We were intrigued to find that the mRNA encoding the transcription factor LrhA, which represses <italic>flhDC</italic> transcription, was among the top RIL-seq interactors for UhpU (Table S1).

<p>To test the effects of UhpU on this target, we fused the 5’ UTR of <italic>lrhA</italic>, which includes the region of the RIL-seq <italic>lrhA</italic>-UhpU chimeras and the predicted base-pairing region, to a <italic>lacZ</italic> reporter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Mandin &amp; Gottesman, 2009</xref>). UhpU overexpression reduced expression of the chromosomally-encoded P<sub>BAD</sub>-<italic>lrhA</italic>-<italic>lacZ</italic> reporter (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3C</xref>). A single nucleotide mutation in the base pairing region of <italic>uhpU</italic> (<italic>uhpU-M1</italic>) eliminated UhpU repression of <italic>lrhA-lacZ</italic>, while a complementary mutation introduced into the chromosomal <italic>lrhA</italic>-<italic>lacZ</italic> fusion (<italic>lrhA-M1</italic>) restored the repression providing direct evidence for UhpU base pairing to <italic>lrhA</italic> leading to repression. Down-regulation of LrhA by UhpU, which is expected to lead to increased FlhDC levels, is in accord with the positive impact of UhpU on motility (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>). To test this model, we monitored the effect of UhpU on bacterial motility in a <italic>lrhA</italic> deletion strain compared to a WT strain (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3D</xref>). Motility was increased in the WT background as expected. In contrast, while the Δ<italic>lrhA</italic> strain was more motile, likely due to <italic>flhDC</italic> de-repression, motility was unaltered by UhpU overexpression indicating that significant UhpU effects on motility are mediated by LrhA.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the RIL-seq data also suggested that <italic>lrhA</italic> directly interacts with other sRNAs such as RprA, ArcZ and McaS (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3A</xref>). Regions of predicted base pairing overlap known seed regions for these sRNAs (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3E</xref>). In translational reporter assays using the <italic>lrhA-lacZ</italic> fusion, both RprA and ArcZ reduced expression, while McaS, despite having the most chimeras, had no effect (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3F</xref>). Possibly the McaS-<italic>lrhA</italic> interaction has other regulatory consequences such as McaS inhibition.</p>

<title>UhpU, MotR and FliX modulate flagellin levels</title>
<p>The high number of chimeras between UhpU, MotR or FliX with the <italic>fliC</italic> mRNA encoding flagellin were striking, particularly between the 3’ end of <italic>fliC</italic> corresponding to FliX (blue) and the 5’ end of <italic>fliC</italic> (red) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4A</xref>). As mentioned above, it was also noteworthy that most of the chimeras were internal to the <italic>fliC</italic> CDS. When we examined the consequences of overexpressing UhpU, MotR, MotR*, FliX or FliX-S on the levels of the flagellin protein, we observed somewhat increased levels of flagellin, both as cytosolic monomers (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4B</xref>) and de-polymerized flagella (Fig S6A) with UhpU and MotR* overexpression and reduced levels with FliX or FliX-S overexpression. These differences are reflected in increased levels of the <italic>fliC</italic> mRNA with overexpression of UhpU, particularly in a <italic>crl</italic><sup>+</sup> background, or MotR or MotR*, particularly at OD<sub>600</sub> ∼0.2 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4C</xref> and S6B).

The impacts of the sRNAs on flagellin protein and <italic>fliC</italic> mRNA levels are consistent with the increased flagella number and/or motility upon UhpU or MotR overexpression and decreased flagella number upon FliX overexpression.</p>

Upon cleavage with RNase III and lead, we observed changes in the regions predicted to be involved in base pairing (thick brackets) that were dependent on the WT RNAs but not with derivatives carrying mutations in the regions predicted to be involved in base pairing. We also observed Hfq dependent changes (thin bracket) in the region from ∼+40 to +66 from the <italic>fliC</italic> AUG, which is enriched for ARN sequences (AAA, AAT, AAC, AAG, AAC), known to be important for mRNA binding to the distal face of Hfq binding (reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Updegrove <italic>et al</italic>., 2016</xref>)). Additionally, we noted that both MotR and the MotR-M1 mutant RNAs led to increased cleavage (asterisks) at some positions and additional protection at other regions (dotted bracket) suggesting a second region of MotR base pairing with <italic>fliC</italic> as well as MotR induced structure changes. In general, the differences in cleavage by RNase III (preference for double-stranded RNA) and lead (preference for single-stranded RNA), indicate the <italic>fliC</italic> sequence from ∼+40 to ∼+170 is more structured than the surrounding regions. These differences in secondary structure could be the reasons for positive regulation by UhpU and MotR and negative regulation by FliX but also complicate analysis using standard reporter fusions with compensatory mutations.</p>

<title>MotR and FliX modulate the S10 operon</title>
<p>Given that genes encoding ribosomal proteins were almost exclusively found in chimeras with MotR and FliX and no other sRNAs, we investigated MotR and FliX regulation of these genes. Several of the top interactions for MotR and FliX in the RIL-seq data mapped to the essential S10 operon, again within the CDSs (Table S1, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5A, 5F</xref> and S5). The co-transcriptional regulation of the S10 operon has been studied extensively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Zengel &amp; Lindahl, 1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Zengel <italic>et al</italic>., 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Zengel &amp; Lindahl, 1992</xref>). The leader sequence upstream of the first gene <italic>rpsJ</italic> encoding S10 is bound by the ribosomal protein L4, encoded by the third gene in the operon (<italic>rplD</italic>), causing transcription termination, thus modulating the levels of all the ribosomal proteins in the operon in response to the levels of unincorporated L4.

<p>To test for MotR regulation of <italic>rpsJ</italic> expression, we fused the S10 leader and part of the <italic>rpsJ</italic> CDS, including the position of the <italic>rpsJ</italic>-MotR chimeras (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5A</xref>) and the region of predicted base-pairing (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5B</xref>), to a GFP reporter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Corcoran <italic>et al</italic>., 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Urban &amp; Vogel, 2009</xref>). MotR overexpression elevated the levels of the <italic>rpsJ-gfp</italic> fusion, and MotR* enhanced this effect (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5C</xref>). Positive regulation of S10 expression by MotR and MotR* was similarly observed by immunoblot analysis of an N-terminal FLAG-tagged S10 protein encoded along with the S10 leader behind the heterologous promoter on a pBAD plasmid (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5D</xref>). A mutation in the MotR seed sequence (MotR-M1 and MotR*-M1, Fig S1A) eliminated the up-regulation of the FLAG-tagged S10 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5D</xref>) and the MotR effect on motility (Fig S8A). To examine base pairing between MotR and the sequences internal to the <italic>rpsJ</italic> CDS, we carried out <italic>in vitro</italic> structure probing in the presence of Hfq (Fig S9A and S9B). The RNase and lead cleavage assays supported the position of the predicted base-pairing between MotR and <italic>rpsJ</italic> mRNA, indicating MotR binds to <italic>rpsJ</italic> at ∼+150 nt in its CDS. Again, we detected Hfq binding (thin bracket), here to the attenuator hairpin in the S10 leader sequence (Fig S8B), which has three ARN sequences (AGG, AGU and AAC). The M1 mutation eliminated binding in the predicted region of pairing but a complementary mutation in the corresponding region of <italic>rpsJ</italic> mRNA did not restore MotR binding (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5E</xref>). We suggest that, as for the MotR target region of <italic>fliC</italic>, MotR binds to more than one site, the MotR target region of <italic>rpsJ</italic> is highly structured, and MotR and Hfq binding might all lead to conformational changes that compound the interpretation of the mutations.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, to further define the determinants needed for MotR-mediated up regulation, we generated a series of <italic>rpsJ-gfp</italic> fusions to include only the first seven amino acids of S10 removing the MotR base pairing site, to remove the S10 leader sequence, to remove stem D required for L4-mediated regulation, or to remove the attenuator hairpin stem E (Fig S8B). MotR-dependent regulation was eliminated for each of these constructs suggesting that S10 leader sequence is needed along with the MotR binding site internal to <italic>rpsJ</italic> CDS for MotR-dependent regulation (Fig S8B). To test if Hfq binding to <italic>rpsJ</italic> is critical for the activation, we repeated the GFP reporter assay in an Hfq<sup>Y25D</sup> mutant defective for binding ARN sequences on the distal face of the protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Zhang <italic>et al</italic>., 2013a</xref>). Supporting a role for Hfq, MotR, which is present at the same levels in an Hfq WT and in the Hfq<sup>Y25D</sup> mutant (Fig S8C), no longer upregulates <italic>rpsJ-gfp</italic> in the distal face mutant background (Fig S8B). Collectively, our results are consistent with MotR base pairing internal to <italic>rpsJ</italic> affecting Hfq binding to the S10 leader sequence, which in turn results in increased <italic>rpsJ</italic> translation.</p>
<p>Based on the RIL-seq data, FliX interacts with multiple regions in the S10 operon mRNA, all internal to CDSs (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5F</xref>). The predicted base-pairing regions (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5G</xref>) align with the highest peaks of chimeras in the RIL-seq data and overlap with the seed sequence suggested for FliX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Melamed <italic>et al</italic>., 2016</xref>). We tested the effects of FliX on expression from this operon by constructing <italic>gfp</italic> fusions to regions of <italic>rplC</italic>, <italic>rpsQ</italic>, and <italic>rpsS</italic>-<italic>rplV</italic>. In all cases, overproduction of FliX or FliX-S led to a reduction in the expression of these fusions (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5H</xref>). To test for a direct interaction between FliX and the <italic>rpsS</italic> mRNA, we again carried out structure probing (Fig 9C and S9D). The regions that were changed in <italic>rpsS</italic> and FliX in the <italic>in vitro</italic> footprinting aligned with the predicted binding region between the two RNAs. Introduction of M1 mutation to FliX (Fig S1A) eliminated binding to <italic>rpsS</italic> mRNA whereas introduction of a complementary mutation to <italic>rpsS</italic> mRNA restored FliX binding (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5I</xref>). We hypothesize that FliX downregulation of the <italic>rplC</italic>, <italic>rpsQ</italic>, and <italic>rpsS</italic>-<italic>rplV</italic> fusions as well as the <italic>fliC</italic> mRNA is due to sRNA-directed mRNA degradation. Further experiments are needed to test this model, but <italic>in vivo</italic> primer extension assays carried out for RNA isolated from in mid-log phase cells (OD<sub>600</sub> ∼0.6) showed an increase in 5’ ends in proximity to the binding site on <italic>rpsS</italic> mRNA in FliX or FliX-S overexpressing strains (Fig S10).</p>

<title>Increased S10 levels correlate with increased readthrough of the flagellar operons</title>
<p>We wondered whether the positive regulation of <italic>rpsJ</italic> by MotR could impact flagella synthesis. The S10 protein encoded by <italic>rpsJ</italic> has two roles in the cell. It is incorporated into the 30S ribosome subunit but also forms a transcription anti-termination complex with NusB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Lüttgen <italic>et al</italic>., 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Luo <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Baniulyte <italic>et al</italic>., 2017</xref>). We evaluated the importance of each of the two S10 roles to flagella number by electron microscopy. First, we overexpressed a S10 mutant (S10Δloop) that is missing the ribosome binding loop but is still active in anti-termination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Luo <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>) from an inducible plasmid and analyzed the number of flagella per cell. Cells carrying S10Δloop plasmid had higher number of flagella like cells overexpressing MotR* (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6A</xref>). We noted that overexpression of wild type S10 from the plasmid used for overexpression of S10Δloop did not lead to an increase in flagella number (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6A</xref>), though presumably MotR is normally increasing flagella number by impacting the levels of the WT protein. Possibly, only a specific concentration of S10 relative to other ribosome proteins increases the S10 role as an anti-terminator. Since <italic>rpsJ</italic> is essential and cannot be deleted, we also examined the effect of MotR* overexpression in a Δ<italic>nusB</italic> strain that cannot form the S10-NusB anti-termination complex. In this background, the stimulatory effect of MotR* on flagella number was eliminated (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6B</xref>) as is also observed for S10Δloop overexpression in the Δ<italic>nusB</italic> background (Fig S11A). Based on these observations, we hypothesize that increased S10 levels upon MotR overexpression leads to increased anti-termination of some of the long flagella operons.</p>

<p>To directly test this anti-termination hypothesis, we carried out RT-qPCR analysis in WT and Δ<italic>nusB</italic> backgrounds to examine the effects of MotR and MotR* overexpression on genes in the <italic>motAB-cheAW</italic> and <italic>tar-tap-cheRBYZ</italic> operons. For both operons, the mRNA levels of the tested genes were increased in WT upon MotR and MotR* overexpression (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6C</xref> and Fig S11B). This increase was not observed for the non-flagellar control gene <italic>cadB</italic>. While the levels of the flagellar mRNAs in Δ<italic>nusB</italic> background were lower than in the WT, MotR and MotR* no longer induced these genes. Together these observations are consistent with the proposal that increased levels of non-ribosome associated S10 leads to increased levels of the S10-NusB anti-termination complex associated with RNA polymerase-σ<sup>28</sup> and increased antitermination of the long operons encoding flagellar proteins. It is also conceivable that even a slight upregulation of the S10 operon, as well as the S6 operon, given a significant number of MotR-<italic>rpsF</italic> chimeras (Table S1), along with antitermination of <italic>rrn</italic> operons, could lead to more active ribosomes, which are needed for flagellar protein synthesis. On the other hand, a negative effect of FliX on ribosomal components, which could reduce the number of active ribosomes, would be consistent with the repressive role of this sRNA.</p>

<title>MotR and FliX have opposing effects on the expression of middle and late flagella genes</title>
<p>In a parallel line of experimentation, we examined the impact of overexpressing MotR* and FliX on the transcriptome by RNA-seq analysis (Table S2). The transcripts whose levels increased most with MotR* overexpression compared to the vector control (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig 7A</xref>) corresponded predominantly to late genes and, to a lesser extent, middle genes, of the flagellar regulon. Of the 332 genes whose expression increased significantly (FDR = 0.05) by MotR* overexpression, 40 are reduced significantly (FDR = 0.05) in a strain lacking σ<sup>28</sup> (Δ<italic>fliA</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Fitzgerald <italic>et al</italic>., 2014</xref>) (Fig S12A).

The levels of C-terminally SPA-tagged FlgJ, also encoded by a class 2 gene, similarly increased across growth upon MotR* overexpression, particularly early in growth, and decreased upon FliX-S overexpression (Fig S13C and S13D). The data suggest that in addition to the effect on antitermination (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6</xref>), MotR more broadly effects transcription initiation at flagellar genes though we do not know the mechanism. In general, these results are coherent with a positive effect of MotR on flagella synthesis and a negative effect of FliX.</p>

<title>MotR increases and FliX decreases flagella synthesis</title>
<p>To examine the impact of chromosomally encoded MotR and FliX on flagella synthesis and the flagellar regulon, we introduced the three-nucleotide M1 substitutions in the seed sequences of <italic>motR</italic> and <italic>fliX</italic> (MotR-M1 and FliX-M1, Fig S1A) at their endogenous chromosomal positions, avoiding the disruption of the nearby genes. MotR-M1 RNA levels were comparable to WT MotR levels (Fig S14A). The prominent ∼200 nt FliX band was reduced for FliX-M1, while other FliX processing products were affected less (Fig S14B).</p>
<p>We first examined the flagella number and motility for these strains. The <italic>motR-M1</italic> chromosomal mutation was associated with a moderate reduction in flagella number at two time points (OD<sub>600</sub> ∼ 0.6 and 2.0) (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig 8A</xref>), while slightly higher numbers of flagella were observed for the <italic>fliX-M1</italic> strain at the later time point (OD<sub>600</sub> ∼ 2.0) (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig 8B</xref>).

In the western analysis in the <italic>motR-M1</italic> strain in comparison to its parental WT, a delayed initiation of FlgJ-SPA synthesis in the mutant was observed (Fig S14E).

<p>While negative effects of the <italic>motR-M1</italic> mutation on flagella synthesis, motility and flagellar gene expression were easily observed, positive effects of the <italic>fliX-M1</italic> mutation were not detected in all assays.

Collectively these observations indicate that MotR, expressed earlier in growth, increases flagella synthesis by positively regulating the middle and the late genes, while FliX, whose levels peak later, decreases flagella synthesis by downregulating the flagellar regulon, mainly the middle and the late genes. Thus, MotR and FliX, along with UhpU, add another layer of regulation to the flagellar regulon (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig 8G</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we describe four <italic>E. coli</italic> sRNAs whose expression is dependent on σ<sup>28</sup>. We found three of these sRNAs affect flagella number and bacterial motility. Although previous studies showed that base pairing sRNAs act on the <italic>flhDC</italic> mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Thomason <italic>et al</italic>., 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">De Lay &amp; Gottesman, 2012</xref>), our results revealed that the effect of sRNAs on flagellar synthesis is far more pervasive. Intriguingly, two of the σ<sup>28</sup>-dependent sRNAs show opposite effects. MotR, expressed earlier in growth, increases expression of flagellar and ribosomal proteins along with flagella number, while FliX, expressed later in growth, decreases expression of these proteins and flagella number. Thus, the two sRNAs, respectively, might be considered an accelerator and a decelerator for flagellar synthesis.</p>
<sec id="s3a">
<title>Non-canonical mechanisms of sRNA action</title>
<p>Most commonly, sRNAs base pair with the 5’ UTRs of mRNA targets or at the very beginning of the CDS, primarily affecting the ribosome binding or mRNA stability. However, MotR and FliX bind in the middle or even close to the ends of their target CDSs in the <italic>fliC</italic> gene and S10 operon. For both <italic>fliC</italic> and the S10 operon, the consequences of MotR and FliX overexpression are different. MotR leads to higher levels of <italic>fliC</italic> and the S10 protein, whereas FliX leads to lower levels of <italic>fliC</italic> and three genes in the S10 operon. We suggest that the positive and negative regulatory effects of MotR and FliX, respectively, occur by the same mechanisms on the <italic>fliC</italic> and S10 transcripts, with MotR changing the conformation of the RNAs and FliX leading to increased cleavage. However, these suggested mechanisms needed to be investigated further in future experiments. It is also noteworthy that, based on RIL-seq data, more examples of this type of interaction remain to be characterized.</p>
<p>Given that our study made extensive use of RIL-seq data, it provides an opportunity to evaluate these data. While RIL-seq provides a comprehensive map of RNA-RNA interactions that take place on Hfq under a specific condition, some caution about the interpretation is warranted as the interactions represent multiple types of relationships between two RNAs. As was found by a recent study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Faigenbaum-Romm <italic>et al</italic>., 2020</xref>), we suggest that if an interaction is highly abundant and discovered under multiple conditions, the sRNA is more likely to have a regulatory impact on the target mRNA though the mechanisms may be unknown. We noticed that the spread of the RIL-seq signal varies significantly between targets. One possible explanation for multiple peaks and a broad distribution is more than one base pairing site for the sRNA on the mRNA, but this hypothesis requires further investigation. We predict additional studies of sRNA-target pairs with different types of RIL-seq signals will give further insights into the steps and outcomes of base pairing.</p>
<p>The most studied and conserved sRNA-binding protein in gram-negative bacteria is Hfq. However, there are other sRNA-binding proteins (reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Melamed, 2020</xref>)). Among these is ProQ, which was shown to have overlapping, complementary, and competing roles with Hfq in <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Melamed <italic>et al</italic>., 2020</xref>). Interestingly, ProQ was found to affect motility and chemotaxis in <italic>S. enterica</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Westermann <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>). In the absence of ProQ, the target sets for the σ<sup>28</sup>-dependent sRNAs on Hfq were changed significantly in <italic>E. coli</italic> (Table S5 in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Melamed <italic>et al</italic>., 2020</xref>)) suggesting that competition between Hfq and ProQ for binding RNAs likely also influences this regulatory circuit. In this context, it is worth noting that FlgO, the fourth σ<sup>28</sup>-dependent sRNA, which originates from the 3’UTR of the <italic>flgL</italic> and strongly binds Hfq, does not have many targets. Possibly, FlgO has a role in titrating Hfq from other sRNAs or proteins, or in the recruitment of other proteins to a complex with Hfq. Interestingly, while the overall sequence of <italic>flgO</italic> is conserved in other bacterial species (Fig S15), the nucleotides in one of the single stranded loops (Fig S1) differ in <italic>S. typhimurium</italic>, possibly suggesting unique regulatory mechanisms in different bacteria.</p>

<title>Conservation of σ<sup>28</sup>-dependent sRNAs</title>
<p>We were surprised to find so many σ<sup>28</sup>-dependent Hfq-binding sRNAs and wondered about their phylogenic distribution. A previous study assessing the conservation of the <italic>motR</italic> and <italic>uhpU</italic> promoters showed that, while the <italic>motR</italic> promoter is well conserved across proteobacteria species, the <italic>uhpU</italic> promoter was not, implying different evolutionary pressures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Fitzgerald <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>). Interestingly, however, a sRNA named RsaG, which originates from the 3’ UTR of <italic>uhpT</italic> and also is induced by glucose-6-phosphate, was found in the Gram-positive bacterium, <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Bronesky <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>). Although there is no sequence similarity between UhpU and RsaG, and RsaG has not been reported to regulate flagella synthesis, the independent evolution of regulatory sRNAs at the 3’ UTRs of <italic>uhpT</italic> in two disparate bacterial species is intriguing.</p>
<p>The σ<sup>28</sup>-dependent sRNAs themselves are conserved among some of the Enterobacteriaceae (Fig S15) and thus may play a role in pathogenicity. During the preparation of this manuscript, two studies describing the application of RIL-seq to <italic>S. enterica</italic> and Enteropathogenic <italic>E. coli</italic> Hfq were published (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Mizrahi <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Matera <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>). The RIL-seq analyses were carried out for cells grown under conditions that do not favor flagellar gene expression, but UhpU, MotR, FliX and FlgO were detected, confirming their synthesis and association with Hfq in pathogenic bacteria. It is likely that still other sRNA regulators of the flagellar regulon remain to be characterized. In <italic>S. enterica</italic>, a leader RNA originating from the <italic>mgtCBR</italic> virulence operon was shown to affect the synthesis of one of the two flagellin genes that exist in this bacterium, impacting virulence and motility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Choi <italic>et al</italic>., 2017</xref>). In neonatal meningitis-causing <italic>E. coli</italic>, a sRNA that is missing from the <italic>E. coli</italic> MG1655 strain used in our study was shown to reduce <italic>fliC</italic> mRNA levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Sun <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>).</p>

<sec id="s3c">
<title>Roles of σ<sup>28</sup>-dependent sRNAs</title>
<p>The UhpU RIL-seq target set includes many flagellar regulon genes and some transcription regulators of the flagellar regulon, such as LrhA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Lehnen <italic>et al</italic>., 2002</xref>), hinting at a mechanism by which UhpU can affect flagella number and bacterial motility. However, since UhpU can also be derived from the <italic>uhpT</italic> mRNA (Fig S1B) and is predicted to have many targets that participate in carbon and nutrient metabolism (Table S1), we suggest this sRNA may play a broader role in linking carbon metabolism with flagella synthesis and motility.</p>
<p>MotR and FliX each have more limited target sets in the RIL-seq data but may comprise a unique regulatory toggle. The transcription of the two sRNA is dependent on the same sigma factor, and they base pair in the CDS of targets in the same operons, but base pairing results in opposing regulation. MotR, which is transcribed from within <italic>flhC</italic> at the top of the flagellar regulon, reaches its highest levels earlier than FliX and increases the flagella synthesis, while FliX, which is cleaved from the mRNA required to make the last protein needed to complete the flagellum, reaches its highest levels later in growth and appears to decrease flagella synthesis.</p>
<p>It is not yet clear how MotR and FliX base pairing with only a few targets can have such pervasive effects on flagellar gene expression and flagella number, but we suggest multiple mechanisms may be involved. One possibility is that the levels of flagellin encoded by <italic>fliC</italic>, up and down regulated by MotR and FliX, respectively, could be part of an autoregulatory loop that impacts the transcription of <italic>flhDC</italic> or other middle or late flagellar gene promoters. The increased and decreased levels of ribosomal proteins brought about by MotR and FliX regulation of the S10 operon also could impact the levels of available ribosomes, where even slight changes could have consequences given the high ribosome cost of flagella synthesis. Finally, we hypothesize that elevated levels of the S10 protein, due to the regulation by MotR, could, in conjunction with NusB, lead to increased antitermination of long flagellar operons.</p>
<p>Based on our hypothesis that the MotR-mediated increase in S10 levels leads to increased antitermination, we speculate that MotR activation of S10 expression could serve an autoregulatory role. Early in growth, transcription initiating from the σ<sup>28</sup>-dependent promoter in <italic>flhC</italic> terminates at the 5’ of <italic>motA</italic> generating MotR. As MotR levels increase, there is a concomitant increase in S10 levels, which could promote readthrough of the <italic>motR</italic> terminator leading to decreased MotR levels and increased full-length <italic>motRAB-cheAW</italic> mRNA.</p>
<p>In general, the σ<sup>28</sup>-dependent sRNAs add a new layer of regulation to the flagellar regulon and reinforce the fact that flagella synthesis is exquisitely regulated. The regulon will continue to serve as a model of a temporal and environmentally-controlled regulatory network with contributions from both transcription factors and regulatory RNAs.</p>

<p><italic>fliA::kan</italic>, <italic>fliCX::kan</italic>, and <italic>fliX-M1:kan</italic> strains were constructed by amplifying the <italic>kan<sup>R</sup></italic> sequence from pKD4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Datsenko &amp; Wanner, 2000</xref>) using oligonucleotides listed in Table S3 and recombining (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Datsenko &amp; Wanner, 2000</xref>) the product into the chromosome of strain NM400 (kind gift of Nadim Majdalani). <italic>flgJ</italic> was SPA-tagged by amplifying the SPA sequence adjacent to <italic>kan<sup>R</sup></italic> sequence from pJL148 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Zeghouf <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>) using oligonucleotides listed in Table S3 and recombining (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Datsenko &amp; Wanner, 2000</xref>) the product into the chromosome of strain NM400. <italic>motR-M1</italic> strain was constructed using the scar-free system, FRUIT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Stringer <italic>et al</italic>., 2012</xref>) as previously described. Briefly, <italic>thyA</italic> was deleted from MG1655 (<italic>crl<sup>-</sup></italic>) (GSO983) strain by PCR amplification of Δ<italic>thyA</italic> from AMD061 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Stringer <italic>et al</italic>., 2012</xref>) followed by recombination using pKD46 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Datsenko &amp; Wanner, 2000</xref>). Next, <italic>thyA</italic> was inserted back to the genome next to the site of mutation and selection was made by growth on minimal media lacking thymine. The <italic>motR-M1</italic> mutation was introduced while simultaneously removing <italic>thyA</italic>. The selection for colonies missing <italic>thyA</italic> was carried out using minimal medium M9 plates supplied with 0.4% glucose, 0.2% casamino acids, 20 µg/ml trimethoprim, and 100 µg/ml thymine. <italic>flgM::kan</italic>, <italic>lrhA::kan</italic>, and <italic>nusB::kan</italic> deletion strains were obtained from other groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Baba <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>) as referenced in Table S3. All deletions and mutations were confirmed by sequencing and then transferred to new backgrounds by P1 transduction. Where indicted, <italic>kan<sup>R</sup></italic> was removed from the chromosome using plasmid pCP20 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Cherepanov &amp; Wackernagel, 1995</xref>). Construction of strains carrying chromosomal <italic>lacZ</italic> fusions was carried out using PM1205 as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Mandin &amp; Gottesman, 2009</xref>). In brief, the <italic>lrhA</italic> fragment was amplified using KAPA Hifi (Fisher Scientific) using oligonucleotides SM079 and SM080 (Table S3) and transformed into PM1205 with a series of selective screens on minimal media plates supplemented with sucrose, LB, LB supplemented with chloramphenicol, and LB supplemented with tetracycline. Mutagenesis of <italic>lrhA-lacZ</italic> fusion was achieved by recombineering an <italic>lrhA-M1</italic> sequence instead of the WT <italic>lrhA</italic> sequence, using gBlock listed in Table S3.</p>

For previously annotated RNA in GTF file, BED files are directly generated with command of generate_BED_file_of_endpoints.py and EcoCyc ID. For genes annotated in the current study, significant chimeras which involve the relevant gene are first extracted from significant interaction file, then chimeric reads involving the S-chimeras are extracted from chimeric read file. To be a qualified chimeric read, RNA1 start position of the read must overlap with the genomic range of RNA1 in S-chimera and RNA2 start position of the read must overlap with the genomic range of RNA2 in S-chimera. Finally, the read list for genes annotated in the current study is supplied to generate_BED_file_of_endpoints.py command to generate BED file.</p>

<p>Bacteria can adapt to extremely diverse environments via extensive gene reprogramming at transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels. Small RNAs are key regulators of gene expression that participate in this adaptive response in bacteria, and often act as post-transcriptional regulators via pairing to multiple mRNA-targets.</p>
<p>In this study, Melamed et al. identify four E. coli small RNAs whose expression is dependent on sigma 28 (FliA), involved in the regulation of flagellar gene expression. Even though they are all under the control of FliA, expression of these 4 sRNAs peaks under slightly different growth conditions and each has different effects on flagella synthesis/number and motility. Combining RILseq data, structural probing, northern-blots and reporter assays, the authors show that 3 of these sRNAs control fliC expression (negatively for FliX, positively for MotR and UhpU) and two of them regulate r-protein genes from the S10 operon (again positively for MotR, and negatively for FliX). UhpU also directly represses synthesis of the LrhA transcriptional regulator, that in turn regulates flhDC (at the top of flagella regulation cascade). Based on RILseq data, the fourth sRNA (FlgO) has very few targets and may act via a mechanism other than base-pairing.</p>
<p>As r-protein S10 is also implicated in anti-termination via the NusB-S10 complex, the authors further hypothesize that the up-regulation of S10 gene expression by MotR promotes expression of the long flagellar operons through anti-termination. Consistent with this possible connection between ribosome and flagella synthesis, they show that MotR overexpression leads to an increase in flagella number and in the mRNA levels of two long flagellar operons, and that both effects are dependent on the NusB protein. Lastly, they provide data supporting a more general activating and repressing role for MotR and FliX, respectively, in flagellar genes expression and motility.</p>
<p>This study brings a lot of new information on the regulation of flagellar genes, from the identification of novel sigma 28-dependent sRNAs to their effects on flagella production and motility. It represents a considerable amount of work; the experimental data are clear and solid and support the conclusions of the paper. Even though mechanistic details underlying the observed regulations by MotR or FliX sRNAs are lacking, the effect of these sRNAs on fliC, several rps/rpl genes, and flagellar genes and motility is convincing.</p>
<p>
The connection between r-protein genes regulation and flagellar operons is exciting and raises a few questions. First, from the RILseq data, chimeric reads with mRNA for r-proteins (including rpsJ) are not restricted to the sigma 28-dependent sRNAs (e.g. rpsJ-sucD3'UTR, rpsF-DicF, rplN-DicF, rplK-ChiX, rplU-CyaR, rpsT-CyaR, rpsK-CyaR, rpsF-MicA...), suggesting that regulation of r-protein synthesis by sRNAs is not necessarily related to flagella/motility. Second, it would be interesting to know if the flagellar operons are more sensitive than other long operons to antitermination following MotR overexpression? In other words, does pMotR similarly affect antitermination in rrn or other long operons?</p>
<p>The general effect of pMotR or pFliX on the expression of multiple middle and late flagellar genes is also interesting even though the mechanism is not clear. While it may be difficult to fully address it, testing whether some of these regulatory events depend on the control of fliC and/or the S10 operon could be relevant (by analyzing the effects in strains deleted for fliC or nusB for instance).</p>

<p>This manuscript discusses the posttranscriptional regulation of flagella synthesis in Escherichia coli. The bacterial flagellum is a complex structure that consists of three major domains, and its synthesis is an energy-intensive process that requires extensive use of ribosomes. The flagellar regulon encompasses more than 50 genes, and the genes are activated in a sequential manner to ensure that flagellar components are made in the order in which they are needed. Transcription of the genes is regulated by various factors in response to environmental signals. However, little is known about the posttranscriptional regulation of flagella synthesis. The manuscript describes four UTR-derived sRNAs (UhpU, MotR, FliX, and FlgO) that are controlled by the flagella sigma factor σ28 (fliA) in Escherichia coli. The sRNAs have varied effects on flagellin protein levels, flagella number, and cell motility, and they regulate different aspects of flagella synthesis.</p>
<p>
UhpU corresponds to the 3´ UTR of uhpT.</p>
<p>UhpU is transcribed from its own promoter inside the coding sequence of uhpT.</p>
<p>MotR originates from the 5´ UTR of motA. The promoter for motR is within the flhC CDS and is also the promoter of the downstream motAB-cheAW operon.</p>
<p>FliX originates from the 3´ UTR of fliC. Probably processed from parental mRNA.</p>
<p>FlgO originates from the 3´ UTR of flgL. Probably processed from parental mRNA.</p>
<p>This is a very interesting study that shows how sRNA-mediated regulation can create a complex network regulating flagella synthesis. The information is new and gives a fresh outlook at cellular mechanisms of flagellar synthesis. The presented work could benefit from additional experiments to confirm the effect of endogenous sRNAs expressed at natural level.</p>

<p>Flagella are crucial for bacterial motility and virulence of pathogens. They represent large molecular machines that require strict hierarchical expression control of their components. So far, mainly transcriptional control mechanisms have been described to control flagella biogenesis. While several sRNAs have been reported that are environmentally controlled and regulate motility mainly via control of flagella master regulators, less is known about sRNAs that are co-regulated with flagella genes and control later steps of flagella biogenesis.</p>
<p>In this carefully designed and well-written study, the authors explore the role of four E. coli σ28-dependent 3' or 5' sUTR-derived sRNA in regulating flagella biogenesis. UhpU and MotR sRNAs are generated from their own σ28(FliA)-dependent promoter, while FliX and FlgO sRNAs are processed from the 3'UTRs of flagella genes under control of FliA. The authors provide an impressive amount of data and different experiments, including phenotypic analyses, genomics approaches as well as in-vitro and in-vivo target identification and validation methods, to demonstrate varied effects of three of these sRNAs (UhpU, FliX and MotR) on flagella biogenesis and motility. For example, they show different and for some sRNAs opposing phenotypes upon overexpression: While UhpU sRNA increases flagella number and motility, FliX has the opposite effect. MotR sRNA also increases the number of flagella, with minor effects on motility.</p>
<p>While the mechanisms and functions of the fourth sRNA, FlgO, remain elusive, the authors provide convincing experiments demonstrating that the three sRNAs directly act on different targets (identified through the analysis of previous RIL-seq datasets), with a variety of mechanisms. The authors demonstrate, UhpU sRNA, which derives from the 3´UTR of a metabolic gene, downregulates LrhA, a transcriptional repressor of the flhDC operon encoding the early genes that activate the flagellar cascade. According to their RIL-seq data analyses, UhpU has hundreds of additional potential targets, including multiple genes involved in carbon metabolism. Due to the focus on flagellar biogenesis, these are not further investigated in this study and the authors further characterize the two other flagella-associated sRNAs, FliX and MotR. Interestingly, they found that these sRNAs seem to target coding sequences rather than acting via canonical targeting of ribosome binding sites. The authors show FliX sRNA represses flagellin expression by interacting with the CDS of the fliC mRNA. Both FliX and MotR sRNA turn out to modulate the levels of ribosomal proteins of the S10 operon with opposite effects. MotR, which is expressed earlier, interacts with the leader and the CDS of rpsJ mRNA, leading to increased S10 protein levels and S10-NusB complex mediated anti-termination, promoting readthrough of long flagellar operons. FliX interacts with the CDSs of rplC, rpsQ, rpsS-rplV, repressing the production of the encoded ribosomal proteins. The authors also uncover MotR and FliX affect transcription selected representative flagellar genes, with an unknown mechanism.</p>
<p>Overall, this comprehensive study expands the repertoire of characterized UTR derived sRNAs and integrate new layers of post-transcriptional regulation into the highly complex flagellar regulatory cascade. Moreover, these new flagella regulators (MotR, FliX) act non-canonically, and impact protein expression of their target genes by base-pairing with the CDS of the transcripts. Their findings directly connect flagella biosynthesis and motility, highly energy consuming processes, to ribosome production (MotR and FliX) and possibly to carbon metabolism (UhpU).</p>
<p>Specific points to be considered:</p>
<p>- The authors use a crl- hyper-motile strain as WT strain for the study and sometimes also a crl+ strain is used. Can the authors comment on potential reasons why some phenotypes (e.g., UhpU and MotR effects on motility) are only detectable in the crl+ strain or vice versa? Is σS regulation important for the function of these sRNAs?</p>
<p>- In several experiments, a variant of MotR sRNA, MotR* that harbors a 3 nt mutation upstream of the seed sequence is used and seems to mediate stronger phenotypes (impact on flagellar number) upon overexpression compared to WT or phenotypes not retrieved for WT MotR (increased flagellin expression). It would be helpful to have some more clarification throughout the text, why this variant was used, even when OE of WT MotR already has impact on the target and how these three mutated nucleotides impact target regulation. For example, does MotR* show increased RNA stability or Hfq binding compared to MotR? Does the mutation in MotR* impact MotR structure (e.g., based on secondary structure predictions) or increase the complementarity with selected targets at potential secondary binding sites (e.g., based on target predictions)? For example, Fig. S7 shows additional regions of interaction between MotR and fliC mRNA beside the seed sequence. It is also suggested that MotR might have multiple interaction sites on rpsJ mRNA. Additional structure probing or biocomputational predictions could clarify these points.</p>
<p>- It is suggested that UphU impacts on motility via regulation of LrhA, which represses transcription of flhDC, and therefore the flagellar cascade. While LhrA-mediated regulation by UphU is validated based on reporter genes, the effect of UhpU OE on FlhDC levels is not directly examined (Fig. 3). Furthermore, as deletion of LrhA de-represses the flagellar cascade and UhpU was also shown to increase motility, the conclusions could be further strengthened by examining flhDC levels and/or the effect of ∆UhpU (if the sRNA part can be deleted) on motility (reduction) due to relieved down-regulation of LrhA.</p>
<p>-This study provides many opportunities for future follow-work. Now that the four sRNAs and some of their targets and opposing effects on flagella biogenesis have been identified, it will be interesting to see how the sRNAs themselves are temporally regulated throughout the flagella biogenesis cascade and which other targets are regulated by them. Future studies could also provide insights into the mechanism and function of FlgO sRNA, which seems to act via a different mechanism than base-pairing to target RNAs, as well as the global effects of regulation of ribosomal genes via FliX and MotR.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>[...] This study brings a lot of new information on the regulation of flagellar genes, from the identification of novel sigma 28-dependent sRNAs to their effects on flagella production and motility. It represents a considerable amount of work; the experimental data are clear and solid and support the conclusions of the paper. Even though mechanistic details underlying the observed regulations by MotR or FliX sRNAs are lacking, the effect of these sRNAs on fliC, several rps/rpl genes, and flagellar genes and motility is convincing.</p>
<p>The connection between r-protein genes regulation and flagellar operons is exciting and raises a few questions. First, from the RILseq data, chimeric reads with mRNA for r-proteins (including rpsJ) are not restricted to the sigma 28-dependent sRNAs (e.g. rpsJ-sucD3'UTR, rpsF-DicF, rplN-DicF, rplK-ChiX, rplU-CyaR, rpsT-CyaR, rpsK-CyaR, rpsF-MicA...), suggesting that regulation of r-protein synthesis by sRNAs is not necessarily related to flagella/motility. Second, it would be interesting to know if the flagellar operons are more sensitive than other long operons to antitermination following MotR overexpression? In other words, does pMotR similarly affect antitermination in rrn or other long operons?</p>
<p>The general effect of pMotR or pFliX on the expression of multiple middle and late flagellar genes is also interesting even though the mechanism is not clear. While it may be difficult to fully address it, testing whether some of these regulatory events depend on the control of fliC and/or the S10 operon could be relevant (by analyzing the effects in strains deleted for fliC or nusB for instance).</p>

<p>We also think the connection between r-protein genes regulation and flagellar operons is exciting and raises some intriguing questions. While there are other RIL-seq chimeras for r-protein genes, the highest numbers are found for MotR and FliX. Nevertheless, understanding the impact of these other sRNAs on the r-protein operons and elucidating which long operons are most sensitive to antitermination following MotR overexpression are important directions for further studies.</p>

<p>[...] This is a very interesting study that shows how sRNA-mediated regulation can create a complex network regulating flagella synthesis. The information is new and gives a fresh outlook at cellular mechanisms of flagellar synthesis. The presented work could benefit from additional experiments to confirm the effect of endogenous sRNAs expressed at natural level.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree that experiments regarding the endogenous effects of endogenous sRNAs are important. We provide such data in Figures 8 and S14 for MotR and FliX in a variety of assays: flagella numbers by electron microscopy, motility and competition assays, expression of flagellar genes by RT-qPCR and western analysis. We went to the trouble of constructing strains carrying point mutations in the chromosomal copies of these genes rather than deletions to avoid interfering with expression of motA and fliC given that MotR and FliX encompass the 5’ and 3’ UTRs respectively.</p>

<p>[...] Overall, this comprehensive study expands the repertoire of characterized UTR derived sRNAs and integrate new layers of post-transcriptional regulation into the highly complex flagellar regulatory cascade. Moreover, these new flagella regulators (MotR, FliX) act non-canonically, and impact protein expression of their target genes by base-pairing with the CDS of the transcripts. Their findings directly connect flagella biosynthesis and motility, highly energy consuming processes, to ribosome production (MotR and FliX) and possibly to carbon metabolism (UhpU).</p>
<p>Specific points to be considered:</p>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>The authors use a crl- hyper-motile strain as WT strain for the study and sometimes also a crl+ strain is used. Can the authors comment on potential reasons why some phenotypes (e.g., UhpU and MotR effects on motility) are only detectable in the crl+ strain or vice versa? Is σS regulation important for the function of these sRNAs?</p>
</list-item></list>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>In several experiments, a variant of MotR sRNA, MotR* that harbors a 3 nt mutation upstream of the seed sequence is used and seems to mediate stronger phenotypes (impact on flagellar number) upon overexpression compared to WT or phenotypes not retrieved for WT MotR (increased flagellin expression). It would be helpful to have some more clarification throughout the text, why this variant was used, even when OE of WT MotR already has impact on the target and how these three mutated nucleotides impact target regulation. For example, does MotR* show increased RNA stability or Hfq binding compared to MotR? Does the mutation in MotR* impact MotR structure (e.g., based on secondary structure predictions) or increase the complementarity with selected targets at potential secondary binding sites (e.g., based on target predictions)? For example, Fig. S7 shows additional regions of interaction between MotR and fliC mRNA beside the seed sequence. It is also suggested that MotR might have multiple interaction sites on rpsJ mRNA. Additional structure probing or biocomputational predictions could clarify these points.</p>

<p>We thank the reviewer for the constructive comments about the variation between the crl- and crl+ strains, and about the use of MotR versus MotR*, and will address these points in a revised version of the manuscript. Regarding the UhpU-mediated regulation, we agree that assays of flhDC expression will strengthen our conclusions. We share the reviewer opinion regarding many opportunities for future follow-up work.</p>
