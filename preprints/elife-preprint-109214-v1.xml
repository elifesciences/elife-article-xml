<abstract><p>Sirtuins are NAD+-dependent histone deacetylases that play a key role in metabolism. Sirtuin activity is compromised in aging and metabolic disorders, and pharmacological strategies that promote sirtuin function including NAD+ boosting approaches show potential as therapeutics. To study the impact of nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) supplementation in mice in high fat diet (HFD) induced obesity and the role of SIRT1, a sirtuin family member, in mediating the NMN response, we administered NMN to mice in drinking water to boost NAD+ in control and in inducible SIRT1 knock-out mouse models and performed a combination of metabolic phenotyping, lipid profiling and plasma proteomics in these mice. We discovered that supplementation with NMN mitigated diet induced weight gain by enhancing energy expenditure, corrected dyslipidemia, and reversed perturbations in fasting blood glucose, all in a SIRT1-dependent manner. On the other hand, NMN-induced reductions in fat mass, fluid mass, eWAT and mesenteric WAT were SIRT1 independent. Proteomic approaches in plasma samples using O-Link and mass-spectrometry provided novel insights into key obesity- and NMN-dependent changes in circulating molecules with potential relevance to inflammation, liver function, and dyslipidemia. We discovered SIRT1 dependent and independent alterations in key circulating plasma proteins and identified key metabolic and molecular pathways that were significantly affected by HFD, several of which were reverted by oral NMN administration. Glucose metabolism, cholesterol metabolism and immune-related pathways are among the most significantly affected changes. Causal analysis of proteomic data suggests that observed effects could be mediated by transcription regulators FBXW7, ADIPOR2 and PRDM16. Collectively, our data supports the hypothesis that promoting SIRT1 function by boosting NAD+ levels in vivo may be a useful strategy to mitigate obesity and associated cardiovascular complications such as dyslipidemia.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Statistics from the World Health Organization show that the prevalence of obesity – defined by a body mass index ≥ 30 kg/m<sup>2</sup> - has significantly increased in the last five decades, and that obese subjects are at a significantly higher risk of morbidity and mortality from obesity-related complications including cardiovascular disease (CVD) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>]. Adipose tissue (AT) regulates an array of key metabolic processes, including storage of lipids, regulation of body temperature, and secretion of hormones like leptin and adiponectin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>]. The most abundant cell-type in AT is the adipocyte, but other AT-resident cell-types with functional importance include fibroblasts, macrophages, and adipocyte progenitors, which respond to metabolic demands by terminally differentiating into adipocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>]. In contrast, AT is dysfunctional in obesity and is characterized by a hypoxic environment, inflammation, adipocyte hypertrophy, adipocyte loss due to apoptosis, cellular senescence, and immune cell infiltration, all of which combine to disrupt organ function and contribute to metabolic syndrome – an umbrella term that includes type 2 diabetes (T2D), hypertension, dyslipidemia, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>]. Obese AT also secretes pro-inflammatory cytokines like interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and serum amyloid A3 (SAA3) into the circulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>], and these factors are known to dampen insulin-sensitivity and sustain inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>]. Important insights into the systemic changes driven by obesity were obtained by applying plasma proteomics approaches to mouse samples, which identified changes in proteins such as thyroxine-binding globulin, apolipoprotein C-II, apolipoprotein E and A4, fructose-bisphosphate aldolase B, and components of the complement cascade [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>]. Changes in the plasma levels of many of these proteins correlated with obesity-associated dyslipidemia and liver dysfunction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>]. Application of O-link proteomics to human samples identified molecules whose plasma levels strongly correlated with body mass index (BMI), visceral adiposity, and weight-loss, including interleukin-6 (IL-6), leptin, fatty acid binding protein 4 (FABP-4), hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), and tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily (TNFRSF) members 10C, 11A, and 14 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>].</p>
<p>Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) – a NAD<sup>+</sup>-dependent enzyme that removes acetyl groups from target proteins to generate O-acyl-ADP-ribose and nicotinamide – regulates key metabolic functions by controlling the activity of targets like PPARγ and PGC-1α [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>]. Data support a role for SIRT1 in promoting mitochondrial biogenesis in adipocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>], regulating preadipocyte proliferative potential [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>], improving insulin-sensitivity and inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>], and suppressing lipid accumulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>]. SIRT1 activity also improves skeletal muscle insulin-sensitivity observed during calorie-restriction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>], mitigates AT inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>], and protects against liver steatosis and inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>]. A positive correlation between adipose SIRT1 expression and energy expenditure or insulin-sensitivity has also been reported in human subjects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>]. SIRT1 function depends on NAD<sup>+</sup>, which can be generated from nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) by nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyltransferases (NMNATs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>]. Therefore, downregulation of these enzymes in the AT of obese mice limits SIRT1 function to promote metabolic dysfunction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>]. Importantly, several studies have demonstrated a decline in cellular NAD<sup>+</sup> levels during aging and in metabolic disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>] and strategies that replenished NAD<sup>+</sup> in mice by supplementation with precursors like NMN and Nicotinamide Riboside (NR) mitigated age-related dysfunction and protected against obesity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>]. On the other hand, recent studies in obese mice revealed that exercise-induced metabolic benefits were <italic>reversed</italic> by NMN administration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>], NR administration only mildly improved metabolic function and energy metabolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>], and boosting NAD<sup>+</sup> levels <italic>in vivo</italic> exacerbated inflammation and cancer progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>]. Therefore, further investigations are necessary to clarify the effects of NAD<sup>+</sup> boosting in an obesity context and to establish whether SIRT1 activation contributes to any potential benefits.</p>
<p>Here we examined the impact of dietary NMN supplementation on weight gain, energy expenditure, dyslipidemia, glucose metabolism and plasma proteome in control and SIRT1 KO mice fed chow or high-fat diet (HFD). We discovered that oral administration of NMN in mice significantly mitigated high-fat diet-induced obesity. NMN-administered mice showed significantly higher energy expenditure during the dark period and a healthier plasma lipid profile, but without a reversal of glucose intolerance or insulin resistance. Importantly, the beneficial effects of NMN administration were strongly attenuated in mice that expressed catalytically-inactive SIRT1. Using a combination of plasma mass-spectrometry and O-link proteomics, we also identified key SIRT1 independent and dependent circulating proteins and pathways that were significantly altered by obesity and oral NMN administration. Glucose metabolism, cholesterol metabolism and immune related pathways are among the most significant changes. These data support the hypothesis that NAD<sup>+</sup>-dependent SIRT1 activity mitigates obesity and associated abnormalities in glucose and lipid metabolism.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="s2a">
<title>Mouse experiments</title>
<p>All animal experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at Weill Cornell Medicine – Qatar (Protocol ID. 2015-0026). The mouse colony was maintained in a facility accredited by the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care (AAALAC). Mice were housed at 23°C in plastic, single-use, individually ventilated cages (Innovive, USA) with unrestricted access to food and water, and maintained in a 12-h light, 12-h dark cycle (Lights on 0600 hrs.; lights off 1800 hrs.). Toes were clipped for identification and genotyping, which was carried out on DNA samples extracted using the HotSHOT method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>]. Tissue samples placed in a 96-well plate were digested for 30 minutes (@95°C) in 75 μL lysis buffer containing 25 mM NaOH and 0.2 mM EDTA, followed by the addition of 75 μL neutralization buffer (40 mM Trizma-HCl). Post-centrifugation, ∼25 μL DNA sample was carefully collected and stored at −20°C. To detect Cre-recombinase expression, the primer set used was: Cre Forward (oIMR1084): GCGGTCTGGCAGTAAAAACTATC; Cre Reverse (oIMR1085): GTGAAA CAGCATTGCTGTCACTT.</p>
<p>The internal positive control primer set was: Forward (oIMR7338): CTAGGCCACAGAATTGAAAGATCT; Reverse (oIMR7339): GTA GGTGGAAATTCTAGCATCATCC. A 96-well thermal cycler (Applied Biosystems) was used for PCR genotyping (20 μL reaction volume) and the thermal cycling parameters were as follows: <underline>Step 1</underline>: Denaturation (94°C, 1 minute); <underline>Step 2</underline> <underline>(30 cycles)</underline>: 94°C, 1 minute; 60°C, 1 minute; 72°C, 1 minute. <underline>Step 3</underline>: 72°C, 10 minutes. The PCR sample was mixed with 4 μL of the 6X loading dye and ∼20 μL was loaded on a 1% agarose gel containing 1 μg/ml ethidium bromide. Gel electrophoresis was performed for 40 minutes at 140V and PCR amplicons were detected on a ChemiDoc<sup>TM</sup> MP Imaging system (Bio-Rad).</p>

<title>Experimental details and NMN supplementation</title>
<p>A tamoxifen-inducible (Cre-ERT2) mouse model for whole-body deletion of exon 4 of SIRT1 has been described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>]. These mice express a catalytically-inactive SIRT1 protein. For experiments, floxed/Cre-ERT2 (Cre-positive) male mice were bred with floxed female mice (Cre-negative) to produce Cre-positive and Cre-negative littermates. Only male mice were used for experiments. SIRT1-deletion was achieved by feeding 8-week-old Cre-positive male mice a diet containing 360 mg/kg tamoxifen citrate for 5 weeks (Modified AIN-93G purified rodent diet, Dyets Inc.). Cre-negative mice were also fed tamoxifen to control for any potential side-effects of tamoxifen administration. To trigger obesity, 13-week-old mice were fed a high-fat diet (HFD) consisting of 60 Kcal% fat (Research Diets, Cat. D12492) or Chow (Pico-Vac Lab Rodent Diet, Cat. 5061) for 20 weeks prior to sacrifice. For the NMN project, NMN (400 mg/kg/day) was provided in drinking water concurrent with the HFD (GeneHarbor, Hong Kong). NMN was dissolved in Aquavive<sup>®</sup> laboratory-grade ultrapure acidified water (pH 2.5-3.0), and the pH of NMN-containing water was not different from that without NMN. Fresh NMN-containing water was provided every 3 days and mice were weighed regularly to monitor changes in body weight and adjust NMN dosage. Mice were euthanized using CO<sub>2</sub> asphyxia and dissected using sterile instruments to isolate tissues, which were immediately snap-frozen in liquid N<sub>2</sub> and stored at −80°C until analysis.</p>

<title>Intraperitoneal glucose-tolerance (IPGTT) and insulin tolerance tests (IPITT)</title>
<p>For IPGTT, mice were fasted for 16 hours overnight prior to performing GTTs (1700 – 0900 hrs.). A 2% glucose solution was prepared in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and sterilized by filtration. After measuring their fasting glucose levels, mice were injected with a dose of 2g/kg glucose and blood glucose levels were monitored 15-, 30-, 60-, and 90-minutes post-injection. Blood was sampled from the tail and measurements were made using an AlphaTRAK2 glucose monitoring kit.</p>
<p>For IPITT, mice were fasted for 6 hours prior to performing ITTs (0900 – 1300 hrs.). A 0.1 unit/ml solution of insulin was prepared by adding 16.6 μL of 10 mg/ml recombinant human insulin (Cat. I9278, Sigma-Aldrich) to sterile PBS. After measuring their fasting glucose levels, mice were injected with an insulin dose of 0.75 units/kg and blood glucose levels were monitored 15-, 30-, and 60-minutes post-injection. Measurements were performed as described above for IPGTT.</p>

<title>Assessment of energy expenditure using the Comprehensive Lab Animal Monitoring System (CLAMS)</title>
<p>The Comprehensive Lab Animal Monitoring System (CLAMS) (Columbus Instruments, USA) is a rodent home-cage system that quantifies O<sub>2</sub> intake (VO<sub>2</sub>) and CO<sub>2</sub> production (VCO<sub>2</sub>), energy expenditure (EE), and respiratory exchange ratio (RER) in experimental animals by indirect calorimetry. RER is the ratio between VCO<sub>2</sub> and VO<sub>2</sub> (VCO<sub>2</sub>/VO<sub>2</sub>) and is a surrogate of substrate utilization. A value of 0.7 indicates reliance on fatty acid metabolism, while a value of 1.0 indicates dependence on carbohydrate metabolism. Before each experiment, the instrument was calibrated using a Class I calibration gas mixture containing 0.5% CO<sub>2</sub> and 20.5% O<sub>2</sub> (Buzwair Scientific and Technical Gases). The experiments were carried out over a 72-hour period; the first 24 hours were used to acclimatize mice to the cages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>] and the next 48 hours were used for experimental measurements. The CLAMS enclosure temperature was set to 23°C and all experiments were started at ∼0900 hrs. Food intake and physical activity were recorded using the in-built functions and animals had access to a running wheel for voluntary exercise. Water intake was assessed by weighing the water bottles before and after the experiment. For post-experiment data processing, the comma separated value (.csv) files generated by the Oxymax software were directly uploaded to the CalR web application [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>] to generate hourly-averaged data for individual mice to compare EE and RER between experimental groups (e.g., with or without NMN) and for statistical analysis and presentation.</p>

<sec id="s2e">
<title>Body composition analysis (BCA) using Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) technology</title>
<p>The body composition (fat mass, fluid, and lean mass) of experimental mice was assessed using the Bruker Minispec Analyzer (Bruker Optics, Inc.), which uses nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) technology. Before each experiment, a ‘daily check’ was performed using a standard provided by the manufacturer to validate the equipment functionality. Mice were transferred to a clear, plastic cylinder capped at one end and then immobilized by inserting a plunger through the other end. The cylinder was then inserted into the sample chamber of the instrument for the duration of the scan, which lasted ∼2-3 minutes. The cylinder was thoroughly cleaned between measurements to remove any urine or feces excreted by the sampled mouse.</p>

<sec id="s2f">
<title>Plasma preparation</title>
<p>Mice were euthanized by CO<sub>2</sub> asphyxiation and ∼0.5-1 ml blood was quickly collected by cardiac puncture and transferred gently to EDTA-coated blood collection tubes (Cat. 367844, BD Vacutainer) to which 100 μL of 2% EDTA had been previously added. A 3-ml syringe and 23G needle were used for cardiac puncture. Blood samples were centrifuged at 1200 rpm for 15 minutes at 4°C and ∼100-150 μL plasma was carefully collected, aliquoted, and stored at −80°C until analysis.</p>

<title>Plasma O-Link proteomics</title>
<p>Protein measurements were performed on plasma samples using the mouse exploratory panel, developed by O-link Proteomics (Uppsala, Sweden) and based on the Proximity Extension Assay (PEA), which employs a pair of oligonucleotide-labeled antibodies specific to each target protein. A unique protein-specific sequence is generated by a DNA polymerization event when 2 matching oligonucleotides are in proximity, which is then quantified by quantitative PCR. The mouse exploratory panel allows the simultaneous quantification of 92 proteins at a time using as little as 1 μL sample volume. The Olink assay was performed at Weill Cornell Medicine-Qatar using the Mouse Exploratory Panel (Product # 95380) to measure protein biomarkers in randomized mouse plasma (EGTA) samples. The assay was carried out according to manufacturer protocol. The O-link assay was performed on a 96-well integrated fluidic circuits chip (Fluidigm, San Francisco, CA) and signal quantification was carried out on a Biomark HD system (Fluidigm, San Francisco, CA). Each sample was spiked with quality controls to monitor the incubation, extension, and detection steps of the assay. Additionally, samples representing negative controls and inter-plate controls were included in each analysis run. From raw data, real time PCR cycle threshold (Ct) values were extracted using the Fluidigm RT-PCR analysis software at a quality threshold of 0.5 and linear baseline correction. Ct values were further processed using the O-link NPX manager software. Here, Ct values of each sample and analyte were normalized based on spiked-in extension controls. Normalization is performed to minimize intra- and inter-assay variation. Inter-plate variability was calibrated using Ct values of inter-plate control samples. Finally, obtained values were inverted to obtain normalized log2 scaled protein expression (NPX) values. Therefore, a difference of 1 NPX between samples corresponds to a doubling of protein concentration.</p>

<title>Plasma mass-spectrometry experiments and data analysis</title>
<p>Pierce BCA Protein Assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 23225, USA) was used to determine the plasma protein concentration. 50 μg protein was digested using iST sample preparation PreOmics kit 96x (PreOmics GmbH, Germany, P.O.00027). 50 μl of the lysis buffer was added to the plasma sample and heated at 95°C in a thermomixer (1000 rpm, 10 minutes). For protein digestion, 50 μl of trypsin/LysC mix was added at 37°C in thermomixer (500 rpm, 3 hours). To stop the reaction, 100 μl of stop buffer was used followed by washing steps to clarify the peptides and remove any hydrophilic or hydrophobic contaminants. Then, peptides were eluted using the elution buffer. After speed vac, purified peptides were resuspended in 50 μl of LC-load buffer at a final concentration of 1 μg/μl and iRT peptides were added. The peptide samples were randomized and analyzed by LC-MS/MS in two batches using the Q Exactive HFX mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific) equipped with a nano-flow chromatographic system (Easy nLC-II 1200, Thermo Scientific). Peptides were ionized by 2.5 kV spray voltage and introduced into the mass spectrometer. For fragmentation of precursor ions, data-dependent analysis (DDA) was conducted following 15 most-intense precursor ions that were detected in the full scan. Dynamic exclusion was applied for 60 seconds, and then the selected ion was fragmented by higher energy collisional dissociation (HCD, collision energy 28).</p>
<p>Data were analyzed using Genedata Expressionist (v.13.0.1) and Mascot (v2.6.2) software. The raw MS data were processed using two Genedata modules: Refiner MS for pre-processing the data and Analyst for post-processing the data and basic statistical analysis. After noise reduction, LC-MS1 peaks were detected and their properties were calculated (m/z and RT limits, m/z and RT averages, intensity). Chromatograms were further aligned based on the RT spectra. Individual peaks were grouped into clusters, and MS/MS data assigned to these clusters were annotated with a Mascot search for MS/MS ions using a peptide tolerance of 10.0 ppm, an MS/MS tolerance of 0.10 Da, a maximum number of missed cleavages of 2, and the Uniprot database for mice. Results were validated by applying a threshold of 1% corrected normalized false discovery rate (FDR). Protein interference was performed based on peptide and protein annotations. Redundant proteins were ignored using Occam’s razor principle, and at least one unique peptide was required for positive protein identification. Protein intensities were calculated using the Hi3 method. The samples were further grouped, and the corresponding data were post-processed using Genedata Analyst. As a first step, the two batches were independently normalized based on the Reference Rows option using the Arithmetic Mean Averaging method and the Relative Function Divide (sum of the total list divided by the number of elements in the list). The individual corrected batches were then merged, and central tendency normalized using the median. To compare the different groups, T-tests were performed using the means and (at least 50%valid protein values per group) to calculate the effect size and corresponding p-values. The calculated effect size reflects the fold change of each protein.</p>

<title>Mass spectrometric acquisition using data-independent acquisition (DIA) and data-dependent acquisition (DDA) and data processing</title>
<p>Mass spectrometric acquisition was performed by a nano-flow chromatographic system (Vanquish Neo UHPLC system, Thermo ScientificTM) coupled to Orbitrap Exploris 480 mass spectrometer (Thermo ScientificTM). One μg of each peptide mixture sample was injected onto EASY-spray PepMap Neo UHPLC C18 column (particle size 2 μm, 100Å, I.D.75 μm, length 50 cm, Thermo ScientificTM) in 45°C column temperature for separation by 120 min gradient and then introduced into mass spectrometer by EASY-Spray™ Source (Thermo ScientificTM) with 2.3 kV spray voltage. For DIA analysis, the full scan (MS1) and MS2 scan were conducted between 350 – 1200 m/z, and 120k resolution for MS1 and 30k resolution for MS2 were applied. For MS 1 scan, normalized automatic gain control (AGC) target 300%, 1 micro scans, and auto maximum injection time mode were used. For MS2 scan, isolation window 23.4 m/z, 27 % HCD collision energy, 1000% normalized AGC target, 1 microscans were used. For DDA analysis, the full scan was conducted between 400-1650 m/z at 120k resolution, standard AGC target and auto maximum injection time. For MS2 analysis, 30k resolution, 60 second dynamic exclusion, 2 isolation window (m/z), custom AGC target mode, 250% normalized AGC target, auto maximum injection time mode, 1 microscans were applied. For fragmentation of the precursor ions, 28% HCD collision energy was used. For data analysis, Spectronaut version 17 (Biognosys) software was used. DIA raw data were processed with DDA raw data by a spectrum centric, also known as library-free approach (direct DIA) using the Mus musculus UniprotKB fasta database (release 2023_08, 55,221 protein entries). The length of peptides was set to range 5 to 52 amino acids, with carbamidomethylation (+57.021 Da) of cysteine as a fixed modification, and acetylation (+42.011 Da) of N-terminal and oxidation (+15.995 Da) of methionine as valuable modification. Twenty ppm tolerance for MS1 and MS2 search, run wise imputing for imputation strategy, and sum peptide quantity for major group quantity were applied. In the post analysis step, t-tests and PCA analysis was calculated using the default parameters in Spectronaut and resulting fold changes and p-values were used for further analysis.</p>

<title>Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) Causal Analysis and String-db Functional Annotation</title>
<p>IPA software (Qiagen) was used for upstream causal prediction function. Upstream analysis identifies potential master regulators that can explain the observed changes in our data based on prior knowledge of expected effects between gene regulators and their target genes stored in the Ingenuity® Knowledge Base. For each potential upstream master regulator two statistical measures are computed: an overlap p-value and an activation z-score. The overlap p-value calls likely upstream regulators based on significant overlap between dataset genes and known targets regulated by an upstream regulator. The activation z-score is used to infer likely activation states of master regulators based on comparison with a model that assigns random regulation directions. Core analysis was performed using the thresholds described for SDE proteins followed by upstream analysis filtering for only Gene products. We chose the union of the top 20 by z-score and top 20 by p-value for visualization and further analysis.</p>
<p>Predicted master regulators and the targets in our dataset were then further annotated. The molecule type was annotated with IPA software. Functional annotations were obtained from string-db and analyzed by matching (case insensitive search) any of several key terms (shown in parenthesis) for six functional categories: Immune function (’Immune’,’Immunity’,’Inflammation’,’T cell’,’B cell’,’Inflammatory’,’leukocyte’,’interleukin’), glucose function (’Glucose’,’Gluocogenesis’,’Sugar’), lipid function (’Adipose’,’Fat’,’Lipid’), energy expenditure (’Energy Expenditure’,’Energy’,’Expenditure’), metabolism (’Metabolism’,’Metabolic’) and Aging (’Aging’,’Senescence’,’Age’). Note that in the functional analysis the predicted master regulator CYP2C19 was replaced with the closest mouse homologue CYP2C29.

<title>Experimental design, data analysis and statistics</title>
<p>Floxed Cre-ERT2 male mice were bred with floxed females to generate Control and SIRT1 iKO mice in the same litter (post-tamoxifen). Age-matched male mice were used for experiments and they were randomly assigned to experimental groups (Chow, HFD, NMN etc.), which were set up to run in parallel. The NMN data described in the manuscript were generated from 2 cohorts. In mice from cohort 1, we performed IPGTT, IPITT, BCA, plasma O-link and mass-spectrometry proteomics, and lipid profiling. After procuring the CLAMS, we repeated the NMN experiment in cohort 2 for <italic>in vivo</italic> measurements of energy expenditure, RER, and physical activity. IPGTT, IPITT, and BCA were repeated in cohort 2 and the results were qualitatively similar to those from cohort 1. The effect of oral NMN on weight-gain during DIO was statistically significant in both cohorts. The investigator(s) was blinded to genotype when weighing the mice and performing metabolic studies, including IPGTT and IPITT. It was not possible to blind the investigator(s) to cages with HFD or NMN because these cages were marked with special husbandry (SPHUB) cards and NMN-containing water was routinely provided in amber-colored bottles to distinguish those cages from the rest. Mice were not excluded during the experiments unless they had to be euthanized due to health issues such as malocclusion, rectal prolapse, or bite wounds due to fighting. Mice were group-housed except during the CLAMS experiments. Experimental mice were randomized during the CLAMS experiments and because the laboratory used a 16-cage system, analysis of NMN-fed Control mice (n=8 per group) was followed by experiments in SIRT1 iKO mice (n=8 per group) for the DIO study. Chow-fed control and SIRT1 iKO mice (n=6 per group) were analysed together. For plasma lipid profiling experiments performed at MSKCC, the technicians were blinded to the experimental details and genotype, and were only provided a mouse identification number and an abbreviated experimental group label. Data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism 9.0 and are presented as mean ± SEM. For statistical analysis of experiments comparing 2 groups, an unpaired Student’s <italic>t</italic>-test was used. In experiments that included more than 2 groups, Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) followed by Tukey’s <italic>post hoc</italic> test was used.

<title>Results</title>
<p>A tamoxifen-inducible (Cre-ERT2) mouse model for whole-body deletion of exon 4 of SIRT1 has been described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>]. These mice express a catalytically-inactive SIRT1 protein (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1a</xref>). For experiments, floxed/Cre-ERT2 (Cre-positive) mice were bred with floxed mice (Cre-negative) to produce Cre-positive and Cre-negative littermates (Supplementary Figure 1a,b). To induce SIRT1-deletion, 8-week old male mice were fed a diet containing 360 mg/kg tamoxifen citrate for 5 weeks. This diet led to weight-loss in both Cre-positive and Cre-negative mice, but this was not significantly different between the two groups (Cre-negative, 2.97±0.51g <italic>vs</italic> Cre-positive, 3.37±0.41g) (Supplementary Figure 1c). Mice were switched to a Chow diet at the end of the 5-week period and sacrificed a week later to evaluate SIRT1-deletion <italic>in vivo</italic>. Expression analysis of Cre-ERT2 and SIRT1 (using primers spanning exon 4 of SIRT1) in epididymal fat (eWAT) revealed that, as expected, Cre-ERT2 was robustly expressed in Cre-positive but not in Cre-negative mice. The data also indicated that – in contrast to tamoxifen-fed Cre-negative (Control) mice – feeding tamoxifen to Cre-ERT2-positive mice significantly reduced SIRT1 expression in eWAT (Supplementary Figure 1d). These mice are hereafter referred to as SIRT1 inducible-knockout (SIRT1 iKO) mice. Importantly, expression levels of other members of the Sirtuin family were not significantly altered between Control and SIRT1 iKO mice (Supplementary Figure 1e).</p>

<title>Oral NMN supplementation mitigates weight-gain in mice fed HFD in a SIRT1-dependent manner</title>
<p>A 20-week HFD study was performed in Control and SIRT1 iKO mice. A subset of mice receiving HFD were also provided the NAD<sup>+</sup> precursor Nicotinamide Mononucleotide (NMN, 400 mg/kg/day) in drinking water to evaluate its effects on HFD-associated changes in weight-gain, energy expenditure, adipose tissue expansion, and glucose- and insulin-sensitivity. Control mice fed HFD gained a significant amount of weight over the course of 20 weeks and increased their body weights by ∼1.7-fold. However, Control mice that received HFD with NMN showed smaller body weight-gains and direct comparisons with mice fed HFD alone were statistically significant after 16 weeks (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). Food and water intake were not different between the two groups (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). Importantly, the suppressive effect of NMN on weight-gain was not observed in HFD-fed SIRT1 iKO mice, and body weights of SIRT1 iKO mice fed HFD alone were not significantly different from those fed HFD with NMN (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). Food and water intake were not different between the two groups (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>).</p>
<p>Next, experiments were performed to investigate if the positive effect of NMN on weight-gain after HFD consumption was associated with improvements in whole-body glucose homeostasis. Blood glucose levels were monitored in the tail veins of fasted Control and SIRT1 iKO mice fed Chow, HFD, or HFD+NMN. In Control mice, consumption of HFD significantly increased fasting blood glucose levels. However, this increase was significantly smaller in Control mice that received HFD+NMN. SIRT1 iKO mice fed HFD also showed significantly higher fasting blood glucose levels but - in contrast to Control mice - the positive effect of NMN on fasting glucose levels was not observed (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>). In summary, the data suggested that weight gain and elevated fasting blood glucose levels observed in mice fed HFD were significantly suppressed upon administration of NMN in a SIRT1-dependent manner.</p>
<p>To evaluate obesity- and NMN-dependent effects on whole-body fat accumulation, body composition analysis was performed on Control and SIRT1 iKO mice fed Chow, HFD, or HFD+NMN. In Control mice, consumption of HFD led to a significant increase in fat mass. However – in agreement with the positive effects of NMN on body weight – mice fed HFD+NMN showed significantly less fat accumulation when compared to those fed HFD alone (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>). Importantly, parallel experiments in SIRT1 iKO mice indicated there was a significant difference in fat mass between SIRT1 iKO mice fed HFD+NMN and those fed HFD alone, although weaker than in Control mice (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G</xref>). We also observed a significant increase in fluid mass in HFD diet fed mice that was significantly reduced by NMN in both the Control and SIRT1 iKO mice (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F,G</xref>).

<title>Adipose tissue expansion in Control and SIRT1 iKO mice fed HFD or HFD+NMN</title>
<p>The effect of obesity and NMN administration on individual fat depots (eWAT and mesenteric fat) was also evaluated. In Control mice, consumption of HFD led to significant expansion of eWAT and this increase was significantly reduced in mice that received HFD+NMN (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>). Feeding HFD to SIRT1 iKO mice also led to eWAT expansion and, interestingly, NMN administration significantly limited this expansion (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>). The effect of obesity and NMN administration on the mesenteric fat (mesWAT) depot was also assessed and these data indicated that, in Control mice, consumption of HFD led to significant expansion of mesWAT and this increase was significantly reduced in mice that received HFD+NMN (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>). Feeding HFD to SIRT1 iKO mice also led to mesWAT expansion and NMN administration significantly limited this expansion (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>).</p>
<p>To summarize, the parameters mWat, fluid mass, fat mass and eWat are all significantly changed in HFD+NMN and HFD+NMN in SIRT1 KO, hence we classify them as SIRT1 independent. On the other hand, SIRT1 dependent changes include total cholesterol, RER, LDL, HDL, fasting glucose, energy expenditure and body weight which are all significantly changed in HFD+NMN in controls but not in HFD+NMN in the SIRT1 KO background. Lastly, water intake, food intake, liver, lean mass and water and blood glucose IPG and IPT are not changed in either condition and hence are also categorized as SIRT1 independent.</p>

<title>Significant changes in the global protein expression profile in plasma of HFD+NMN-fed mice</title>
<p>We conducted plasma proteomics on the experimental cohort using two platforms: O-Link, an aptamer-based technology for a panel of 92 mouse proteins and mass spectrometry as summarized in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>. The overall group responses were very similar for the two platforms as shown in the PCA plots in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>. Chow-fed mice in both the Control and SIRT1 iKO are in distinct clusters separate from the HFD-fed mice. In contrast, HFD+NMN-fed mice had relatively small but consistent effects on global protein expression profiles. All proteomics data was therefore combined and used for identifying significant differentially expressed proteins (SDE proteins) and functional enrichment analysis.</p>

<title>High Fat Diet modulates linked pathways including Cholesterol metabolism, PPAR signaling proteins and Complement and Coagulation Cascade pathways in Control Mice</title>
<p>First, we examined the impact of HFD consumption on the plasma proteome of Control mice. As shown in the volcano plot, there were large expression changes due to HFD with 65 upregulated SDE proteins and 53 downregulated SDE proteins (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). The top 10 non-immunoglobulin upregulated proteins are Creb3l3, Camp, Apoc2, Apoa5, Me1, Prg4, Saa1, Aldob, Lgals3 and Apoe while the top 10 non-immunoglobulin downregulated proteins are Serpina1e, Mup8, Tnc, Lifr, Mup2, Egfr, Serpina3k, Cfd, Cdh1 and Col3a1. Note the presence of multiple apoliporoteins among the top 10 upregulated proteins and two Mup proteins among the top 10 downregulated proteins. To determine if there are enriched pathways, we performed pathway enrichment analysis with STRING-DB. Among the top enriched KEGG pathways by pathway FDR include the complement and coagulation cascades, cholesterol metabolism and biosynthesis of amino acids (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>). Please note that proteins could belong to more than one KEGG pathway (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>). For example, Apoa1, Apoa2, Apoa3 are members of both the KEGG cholesterol metabolism and KEGG Pparg signaling pathways.</p>

</fig>
<p>To examine the general expression trends within pathways, we overlayed the expression of members of individual pathways onto the volcano plot. We see that while complement/coagulation members and amino acid biosynthesis genes are mostly decreased in response to HFD, cholesterol metabolism and PPAR signaling pathway proteins are all mostly increased (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>). One protein that is significantly upregulated in response to HFD but does not belong in enriched KEGG, reactome, wikipathway or PFAM is ApoN. ApoN is classified as a pseudogene in humans but is expressed in mice liver and is thought to be involved in cholesterol metabolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>] .</p>
<p>Interestingly the network diagram shown in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref> depicts numerous links between proteins belonging to separate KEGG pathways. For example, there are links between the completement and coagulation cascades proteins and cholesterol metabolism proteins. These links primarily reflect co-expression and co-mention in literature abstracts. Furthermore, many highly differentially expressed genes are not members of any of the top pathways depicted. Therefore, the overall complexity of interactions among the HFD induced proteins is not fully captured by looking at only the top pathways or at pathways individually. We later examine in an integrated method all gene expression patterns in a non-pathway centric method.</p>

<title>Oral NMN supplementation significantly alters plasma levels of proteins linked to metabolic pathways</title>
<p>We next examined the effect of NMN treatment on HFD-fed Control mice. We found that NMN supplementation was associated with significant upregulation of 18 proteins and downregulation of 16 proteins (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>). The top non-immunoglobulin upregulated proteins are Cct7, Il17a, Serpina1e, Mup2, Mup8, Ca3, Mup20, Cct4, Capn2 and Slc2a3, while the top downregulated proteins are Ppbp, Gsr, Thbs1, Angpt1, Pf4, Pde5a, Mtpn, Pgm2, Eef1b2, Rida and Pdgfb, Spta1 and Fabp3.

<title>Plasma proteins linked to metabolic pathways downregulated in SIRT1 iKO mice</title>
<p>In parallel with the control mice, we also conducted proteome profiling experiments on the SIRT1 KO mice. SIRT1 knockout had a large downregulatory effect on protein expression on mice in all tested conditions (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>). SIRT1 KO in the CHOW condition downregulated 23 proteins and upregulated 1 protein (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A</xref>). The top 10 downregulated proteins are Pygl, Fh, Cyb5a, Pvalb, Creb3l3, F11, Ctsd, Saa2, Mup4 and Dpp4 while 1 upregulated SDE protein is Serpina3m. Enrichment analysis of the SDE proteins demonstrate a metabolic phenotype with the top five enriched KEGG pathways being glucagon signaling, glycolysis/glucogenesis, carbon metabolism, glycine, serine and threonine metabolism and metabolic pathways (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7B</xref>).

<p>Similarly, SIRT1 KO impacted mice fed a high fat diet with five upregulated proteins and 81 down regulated proteins(<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7D</xref>). The top 10 downregulated proteins are Ppbp, Gsr, Dnpep, Psme1, Fh, Ctsz, Cyb5a, Dbi, Obp1a and Calu while the top 2 non-immunoglobulin upregulated are Vasn and C1qa. As in the CHOW condition, SDE proteins were enriched in metabolic pathways with the top five enriched KEGG pathways being metabolic pathways, carbon metabolism, starch/sucrose metabolism, pentose phosphate pathway and fructose/mannose metabolism (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7E</xref>). While many of the SDE proteins have known interactions, many also have no strong links to other proteins within the network (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7F</xref>).</p>
<p>Finally, there is a large impact of SIRT1 KO on NMN supplementation in HFD. Notably, SIRT1 KO reduces the expression of many changes relative to WT with 7 upregulated proteins and 69 downregulated proteins (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7G</xref>). The top seven non-immunoglobulin upregulated SDE genes are Thbs1, Calm1, Enpp2, Plxdc2, Ctrb1, Ldhb and the top 10 non-immunoglobulin downregulated SDE genes are Ran, Heg1,Ctsz, Rplp1, Gm20441, Cct7, Emilin1, Snd1, Adh5 and Scp2. Enrichment analysis on SDE proteins shows that the KEGG proteosome and metabolic pathways are enriched (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7H</xref>).

<title>Discovery of gene clusters linked to HFD using unsupervised hierarchical clustering</title>
<p>While the previous analysis focused on the highest individual protein changes and enriched pathways, there were numerous significant proteins that were not in the top enriched pathways. We therefore performed a grouped analysis combining significant results from different comparisons.</p>
<p>This resulted in a set of 344 genes to analyze. We also performed network-based clustering using the MCL algorithm as described in the methods (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref>). The results of MCL show that the network structure is composed of several subnetworks with two large networks (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8A</xref>, 8B). Different clusters are enriched in different pathways as shown in <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8C</xref>.

<p>We also performed unsupervised hierarchical clustering on the expression values for each of the four comparisons annotating the MCL clusters and the proteomics technology use (supplementary Figure 2). The sample clustering clearly groups the samples with diet effect and NMN effects with an overall similar pattern for the SIRT1 KO and Control samples. The two main gene cluster groups are driven by genes that change expression due to the high fat diet. The top expressed changes with HFD is a gene cluster containing Creb3l3, Saa1, Saa2, Camp, Apoc2, Prg4 and Apoa5. These genes are mostly in MCL cluster 2 and are members of enriched pathways affecting PPAR signaling, cholesterol metabolism and PI3-Akt signaling. The bottom cluster are genes that are reduced in HFD and include Ppbp, Pdgfb, Try5, Gm20441, Jchain, Rida, Dbi, Ass1, Abhd14b, Gsta3, Gstm1 and Serpina1e.

Note that we consider changes based on the effect size direction allowing clustering based on gene expression pattern.</p>
<p><xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9</xref> depicts a clustergram of all SIRT1 independent changes. A top cluster including Creb3l3, Apoc2, Prg4 and Apoa5 shows increased levels with HFD and reduction with NMN in both the Control and SIRT1 KO samples. These genes are members of several enriched pathways including cholesterol metabolism, PPAR signaling and PI3K-Akt signaling and include MCL cluster 1 and 2 members. Other proteins with large changes with a similar pattern include Spta1, Fabp3, Ran and Ldhb. At the opposite extreme are genes that are downregulated with HFD but increased with NMN. These include Serpina1e, CA3, Gstm1, Tnc, and Lifr. These genes are in enriched metabolic and complement and coagulation cascade pathways. Note also the presence of a cluster containing Mup2, Pigr, Hpd, Mup8, Fabp1 and Akr1c6. These genes all have reduced gene expression in HFD but increased expression in response to NMN supplementation. Interestingly they all fall in MCL cluster 2 and have several lipocalin domain proteins (Mup2, Mup8 and Fabp1) and are members of enriched metabolic pathways, tyrosine metabolism, PPAR signaling pathway and fat digestion and absorption.</p>

We see that while Saa1 and Saa2 genes (both in MCL Cluster 2) are upregulated in response to HFD, they are slightly reduced with NMN with SIRT1 KO but slightly increased with NMN in the control mice. Two other genes Plin1 and Apeh show upregulation with HFD in the controls and SIRT1 KO but only reduction with NMN in the control. Plin1 is a member of the enriched PPAR signaling pathway while Apeh is not a member of any enriched pathway or any MCL cluster. <xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Figure 10B</xref> shows SIRT1 KO genes that impact only the diet effect.

<title>Causal Analysis of NMN effect on Diet Induced Obesity</title>
<p>To gain greater insight into potential upstream regulators of the observed changes, we performed causal analysis with Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software. Causal analysis attempts to identify regulators where the directionality of the observed expression changes is consistent with the observed effects reported in the literature or in public datasets. We show in <xref rid="fig11" ref-type="fig">Figure 11</xref> the results of this analysis where we aggregate the top 20 master regulators by z-score and by p-value and the expression of their downstream targets present in our data.

In addition, Adam9 and Crmp1 were also identified as upstream regulators that were significant activated. Interestingly, we also observe a cluster of two predicted inhibited master regulators consisting of Adipor2 and Prdm16 linked to a cluster of upregulated Mup proteins.

A few genes are also associated with energy expenditure including Idh1, Mup3, Slc4a1, Pgm2, Mdh2 and Plin1. Several genes linked with aging or senescence are also observed including Capn2, Col1A2, Sod1 and Txn.</p>
<p>These genes and functions are strongly associated with at least one predicted master regulator.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our data show that oral administration of NMN significantly protected against HFD-associated weight-gain in Control but not SIRT1 iKO mice. Fasting blood glucose levels were elevated in HFD-fed mice, which were significantly normalized in NMN-fed Control but not SIRT1 iKO mice. Importantly, NMN administration enhanced energy expenditure (EE) and RER during periods of activity in Control but not SIRT1 iKO mice. Finally, we report comprehensive plasma proteome changes that were triggered by HFD consumption, NMN administration, and SIRT1 deletion, identifying key genes and pathways involved in key metabolic processes including glucose metabolism, cholesterol metabolism and immune related gene networks. Our discoveries also align favorably with the effects of NMN supplementation in human subjects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>].</p>
<sec id="s4a">
<title>Comparison with previous studies</title>
<p>In order to allow a comparison between our study and the published literature, we selected a dose and route of administration for NMN that is similar to what has been reported previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>]. Importantly, a protective effect of oral NMN in age-associated weight-gain in chow-fed mice has been reported previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>]. Because the effect of NMN has been widely investigated in chow-fed mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>], we focused these studies on obese mice. NMN was well-tolerated by the mice as indicated by similar water intake. Our phenotypic results are broadly consistent with findings of NMN induced weight loss reported in 2023 by Zhang <italic>et al</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>]. The blood proteome results in diet induced obesity are also similar to those reported in Stocks <italic>et al</italic> in ob/ob mice, a model of genetic obesity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>] with increased expression of apolipoproteins and reduction in MUPs and some complement proteins. The resistance to weight-gain in NMN-fed mice is not due to reduced food consumption because food intake was not significantly different between the mice that were fed HFD alone or HFD+NMN. In contrast, SIRT1 iKO mice fed HFD gained less weight than Control mice, and this may be due to a small but significant decrease in food intake. However, the ‘protective’ effect of NMN against weight-gain was not observed in SIRT1 iKO mice. Consistent with previous studies in male mice, we did not observe any significant benefit in glucose-tolerance or insulin-sensitivity, but NMN administration exerted a significant protective effect against dyslipidemia in obese mice, an effect that was again heavily SIRT1-dependent. The SIRT1-dependent increase in EE is consistent with a previous report that showed increased EE in mice that overexpressed SIRT1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>]. SIRT1 overexpression did not improve skeletal muscle insulin resistance in obese mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>]. A previous study using nicotinamide also reported data consistent with ours, particularly in terms of a protection against weight-gain, enhanced EE, and a weak or no effect on glucose-tolerance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>].</p>

<sec id="s4b">
<title>Similarity between phenotype and proteome changes</title>
<p>The main significant phenotypes we observed are increased weight, impaired fasting glucose, increased cholesterol and LDL with high fat diet which is reversed with NMN and was associated with increased energy expenditure. SIRT1 iKO reduces the protective effects of NMN consistent with the role of SIRT1 in regulating energy metabolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>]. These phenotypic changes are mirrored in the proteomic data. First, SIRT1 iKO leads to a significant reduction in plasma proteins relative to control mice for chow, high fat diet and NMN+ high fat diet mice. Second, significant plasma proteins are enriched in key metabolic pathways affecting cholesterol metabolism, PPAR signaling, amino acid and glycolysis pathways. Third, there are SIRT1 independent and dependent genes reflecting the complex SIRT1 iKO phenotype. Fourth, when comparing SIRT1 proteomic effects in the same condition (for example SIRT1 KO CHOW vs Control Chow), we see a large downregulation of most proteins. This is consistent with the SIRT1 KO phenotype of lower weight compared to Control mice (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>,<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1C</xref> and Figure S1) at the same mouse age in the chow, HFD and HFD+NMN conditions. The weight difference between Control and SIRT1 KO mice on a Chow diet is reflected in relatively few significant proteomic changes compared to Control and SIRT KO mice on a HFD diet and HFD diet+NMN (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>, <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>).</p>

<title>Key transcription factors in NMN supplementation biology</title>
<p>We find Creb3l3 (aka CREB-H) to be a SIRT1 independent highly increased transcription factor in response to HFD which can be reduced by NMN. Creb3l3 is secreted in the liver and gut in mice and has been shown to be involved in metabolic inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref>] and lipid metabolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref>]. We also predict through upstream causal analysis that Pprgc1a (aka PGC-1a) mediates several downstream observed targets including Sod1, Lipc and Fabp3. In the same cluster as Pprgc1 are Foxa2 which has been shown to mediate transcriptional response to fasting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref>] and Stat5b linked to immune function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref>]. Pprgc1a has been shown to be involved in numerous mitochondrial energy metabolism processes and mice knockouts have shown resistance to high fat diet induced insulin resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref>].</p>

<title>Plasma proteomics: cholesterol metabolism and immune related genes</title>
<p>Our proteomic analysis has also highlighted an interesting connection between different genes and pathways. The cholesterol metabolism and coagulation cascade/immunity associated genes that are changed in our analysis especially in the HFD mice are also part of the same MCL Cluster 2 due to co-expression and co-mention in the literature. Our data shows that upregulation of cholesterol metabolism genes is linked to downregulation of many complement/coagulation genes. In addition, causal analysis shows many immune related proteins regulated similarly as genes known to affect lipid function. The complement system mediates many immune functions including defense, inflammation, pathogen targeting and infected cell lysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref>]. Human diseases linked to the complement system include asthma and systemic lupus erythematosus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref>]. Deregulation of complement proteins affects immune response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref>]. This data suggests that lipid dysregulation is strongly linked with immune function dysregulation which could underly inflammatory diseases like atherosclerosis.</p>
<p>In addition, we observe generally numerous links between proteins as shown in the string-db analysis and in the causal analysis. NMN supplementation of HFD fed mice shows systemic proteomic profile changes.</p>

<title>Mouse urinary proteins (MUPs) and signaling</title>
<p>We have also observed genes that are in different pathways but contain the same lipocalin binding domain. Lipocalin domains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref>] are part of a family of lipid binding transporters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref>]. This includes genes that are members of enriched PPARG and cholesterol metabolism pathways and also MUP proteins. In our data, MUP proteins are downregulated in obese mice and upregulated in response to NMN. MUP proteins were originally identified as secreted in mouse urine but have since been found to play a role in nutrient signaling in mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref>]. The highly similar expression pattern for both the known signaling genes (ex. FABP3) and MUP proteins strengthens the idea that MUPs could play a more central role in metabolism and metabolic signaling in mice than previously appreciated.</p>
<p>Interestingly, while humans have not been reported to have functional analogs of mouse MUPs, humans have several lipocalin proteins including ApoD, ApoM and RBP4 which play an intrinsic role in metabolism and LCN2, C8G, ORM1, ORM2 and PAEP which are associated with various immune functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">73</xref>]. Many human lipocalin containing proteins have not yet been functionally characterized and it would be interesting to investigate if they play an orthologous role as MUPs in mouse metabolism.</p>

<title>SIRT1 dependence</title>
<p>When comparing the diet effect and NMN effect in the control and SIRT1 KO based on gene expression direction (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9</xref>-<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">10</xref>), we observe that while most proteins act in a SIRT1 independent manner, there are several proteins which show clear SIRT1 dependence. Saa1 and Saa2 are two similar proteins which are reversed with NMN in the SIRT1 background but not in the control background. Saa1 and Saa2 are parts of the serum amyloid A family and are expressed in the intestine and liver and play a role in atherosclerosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">74</xref>] and cholesterol efflux [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">75</xref>]. Perilipin 1 (Plin1) is another protein with SIRT1 dependence which shows increase with HFD and reversal with NMN in control mice but no significant changes in the SIRT1 background. Plin1 is a lipid-droplet binding protein and plays a role in regulating insulin sensitivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">76</xref>].</p>

<title>Predicted Regulators of NMN effect</title>
<p>Combining our analysis with predictive analysis allows us to build a model of transcription factors that may underlie NMN effects. The most significant predicted activated transcription factor is Fbxw7 as it has a high z-score (indicating observed expression directions are consistent with expected expression direction) and a low p-value (indicating that it affects many proteins). Fbxw7 is part of the ubiquitin ligase system. Specifically, it is a substrate recognition protein that targets for degradation several lipid metabolism genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">77</xref>] acting in some proteins through Notch2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">78</xref>]. Two other interesting inhibited potential regulators are Adiponectin receptor 2 (Adipor2) and PR domain containing 16 (Prdm16). In our analysis, Adipor2 is predicted to be inhibited in response to NMN in HFD mice. A previous study showed that knocking out Adipor2 in mice led to improved dyslipidemia but worse glucose control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">79</xref>], consistent with some of the observed effects in NMN supplementation on HFD mice. Prdm16 is an extensively studied gene with observed effects in thermogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">80</xref>] and exercise induced adipose tissue remodeling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">81</xref>]. Both Adipor2 and Prdm16 are linked to the expression of MUP proteins. Our analysis also identified predicted inhibition of the opioid receptor Δ (Oprd1), which is interesting for two reasons. First, because Oprd1 KO mice show enhanced energy expenditure (despite being hyperphagic), thereby resisting weight-gain when fed HFD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">82</xref>]. Second, because variants in Oprd1 have been previously linked to adiposity and glycemic control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">83</xref>]. Our analysis also predicted activation of Crmp1, which is interesting considering its link to age-related diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">84</xref>].</p>

<title>Limitations</title>
<p>Our study provides strong evidence for the beneficial effects of NMN supplementation in obese mice, including improving dyslipidemia, reducing weight-gain, and acting through well-established metabolic and immune related pathways. However, further investigations are required to address some of the limitations of our study. One limitation is that our proteomic data comes from blood, so the tissue origin of the secreted molecule is not clear. Second, direct investigations of protein activity would be valuable in assessing if the altered expression levels correlate with altered function. Third, while our data support the predicted causal effects, direct evidence of causality requires additional experiments. Mechanistic inference is further complicated by the fact that we measure the proteins in blood while the effects and protein levels could be different in different tissues.</p>
<p>Overall, our results show a protective effect of NMN on diet induced obesity in mice which is partially mediated by SIRT1. These phenotypes are reflected in blood proteome changes in linked lipid metabolism and immune pathways and through different metabolic pathways.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This manuscript investigates the effects of oral supplementation with nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) on metabolism and inflammation in mice with diet-induced obesity, and whether these effects depend on the NAD⁺-dependent enzyme SIRT1. Using control and inducible SIRT1 knockout mice, the authors show that NMN administration mitigates high-fat diet-induced weight gain, enhances energy expenditure, and normalizes fasting glucose and plasma lipid profiles in a largely SIRT1-dependent manner. However, reductions in fat mass and adipose tissue expansion occur independently of SIRT1. Comprehensive plasma proteomic analyses (O-Link and mass spectrometry) reveal that NMN reverses obesity-induced alterations in metabolic and immune pathways, particularly those related to glucose and cholesterol metabolism. Integrative network and causal analyses identify both SIRT1-dependent and -independent protein clusters, as well as potential upstream regulators such as FBXW7, ADIPOR2, and PRDM16. Overall, the study supports that NMN modulates key metabolic and immune pathways through both SIRT1-dependent and alternative mechanisms to alleviate obesity and dyslipidemia in mice.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Well-written manuscript, and state-of-the-art proteomics-based methodologies to assess NMN and SIRT1-dependent effects.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the study design, as well as the data analysis approach taken by the authors, are flawed. This limits the authors' ability to make the proposed conclusions.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Majeed and colleagues aimed to evaluate whether the metabolic effects of NMN in the context of a high-fat diet are SIRT1 dependent. For this, they used an inducible SIRT1 KO model (SIRT1 iKO), allowing them to bypass the deleterious effects of SIRT1 ablation during development. In line with previous reports, the authors observed that NMN prevents, to some degree, diet-induced metabolic damage in wild-type mice. When doing similar tests on SIRT1 iKO mice, the authors see that some, but not all, of the effects of NMN are abrogated. The phenotypic studies are complemented by plasma proteomic analyses evaluating the influence of the high-fat diet, SIRT1, and NMN on circulating protein profiles.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The mechanistic aspects behind the potential health benefits of NAD+ precursors have been poorly elucidated. This is in part due to the pleiotropic actions of NAD-related molecules on cellular processes. While sirtuins, most notably SIRT1, have been largely hypothesized to be key players in the therapeutic actions of NAD+ boosters, the proof for this in vivo is very limited. In this sense, this work is an important contribution to the field.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>While the authors use a suitable methodology (SIRT1 iKO mice), the results show very early that the iKO mice themselves have some notable phenotypes, which complicate the picture. The actions of NMN in WT and SIRT1 KO mice are most often presented separately. However, this is not the right approach to evaluate and visualize SIRT1 dependency. Indeed, many of the &quot;SIRT1-dependent&quot; effects of NMN are consequent to the fact that SIRT1 deletion itself has a phenotype equivalent to or larger than that induced by NMN in wild-type mice. This would have been very evident if the two genotypes had been systematically plotted together. Consequently, and despite the value of the study, the results obtained with this model might not allow for solidly established claims of SIRT1 dependency on NMN actions. The fact that some of the effects of SIRT1 deletion are similar to those of NMN supplementation also makes it counterintuitive to propose that activation of SIRT1 is a major driver of NMN actions. Unbiasedly, one might as well conclude that NMN could act by inhibiting SIRT1. The fact that readouts for SIRT1 activity are not explored makes it also difficult to test the influence of NMN on SIRT1 in their experimental setting, or whether compensations could exist.</p>
<p>A second weak point is that the proteomic explorations are interesting, yet feel too descriptive and disconnected from the overall phenotype or from the goal of the manuscript. It would be unreasonable to ask for gain/loss-of-function experiments based on the differentially abundant peptides. Yet, a deeper exploration of whether their altered presence in circulation is consistent with changes in their expression - and, if so, in which tissues - and a clearer discussion on their link to the phenotypes observed would be needed, especially for changes related to SIRT1 and NMN.</p>
<p>Impact on the field and further significance of the work:</p>
<p>Despite the fact that, in my opinion, the authors might not have conclusively achieved their main aim, there are multiple valuable aspects in this manuscript:</p>
<p>(1) It provides independent validation for the potential benefits of NAD+ boosters in the context of diet-induced metabolic complications. Previous efforts using NR or NMN itself have provided contradicting observations. Therefore, additional independent experiments are always valuable to further balance the overall picture.</p>
<p>(2) The metabolic consequences of deleting SIRT1 in adulthood have been poorly explored in previous works. Therefore, irrespective of the actions of NMN, the phenotypes observed are intriguing, and the proteomic differences are also large enough to spur further research to understand the role of SIRT1 as a therapeutic target.</p>
<p>(3) Regardless of the influence of SIRT1, NMN promotes some plasma proteomic changes that are very well worth exploring. In addition, they highlight once more that the in vivo actions of NMN, as those of other NAD+ boosters, are pleiotropic. Hence, this work brings into question whether single gene KO models are really a good approach to explore the mechanisms of action of NAD+ precursors.</p>

<p>We thank the reviewer for highlighting that state-of-the-art proteomic research methods used, and we report for the first time on significant changes in plasma proteomics in mice after NMN supplementation in both wild-type and SIRT1-KO mice using a combination of DIA mass spectrometry and Olink.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>We agree that the administration of tamoxifen, along with the associated weight loss, could affect the obesity phenotype. For this reason, we ensured that both Cre-positive and Cre-negative mice received tamoxifen. Importantly, after the tamoxifen 'washout', the two groups weighed essentially the same. Going forward, we plan to address this comment by performing additional statistical tests on all six experimental groups to gain insights into dependencies. Based on your suggestions, we will clarify the limitations of the study design and improve the data analysis approaches to provide stronger support for our conclusions in the revised version of the paper.</p>

<p>We thank the reviewer for acknowledging the importance of this work to the field. In this report, we provide in vivo evidence of the action of NAD+ boosting, and hope to delineate the action of Sirt1, as well as the pleiotropic effects of NAD-related molecules on cellular and metabolic processes.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for raising this point and acknowledge the limitations of using Sirt1 iKO mice. However, inducing Sirt1 KO in adulthood is a better alternative than using a homozygous Sirt1 KO mouse model, as the latter leads to embryonic lethality and many other developmental defects (1, 2). The proteomics analysis can provide insight into the effects of SIRT1 deletion under chow and high-fat diet (HFD) conditions, as well as the effects of diet in the presence or absence of nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN). We will discuss these limitations and present the results for the two genotypes together, as suggested.</p>

<p>First, we presented the data in this manner as a proof of concept, to demonstrate the effect of the diet on the plasma proteome and corroborate our findings with those published in the literature. We then investigated the effects of NAD boosting and Sirt1 KO in order to identify significant changes. We agree with the reviewer that it would be unreasonable to validate all the differentially abundant proteins. However, we will choose key proteins and assess their expression in different tissues, such as the liver, white adipose tissue (WAT) and muscles, and attempt to connect these changes with the phenotypes.</p>
