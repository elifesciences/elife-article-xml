<title>Abstract</title>
<p>The mammalian cornea constantly regenerates its outer epithelial layer. Cells lost by abrasion are replaced by division of both corneal epithelial cells and populations of stem cells around the corneal periphery, the limbus. Limbal-derived epithelial cells migrate into the cornea, retaining equal cell loss and replacement rates (the ‘XYZ hypothesis’). This process leads to a striking stable spiral cell motion pattern across the corneal surface, with a central vortex. Here, we show that the emergence of the spiral pattern can be explained by the interplay of the position of the limbus, cell division, extrusion, and collective cell migration along the curved surface of the cornea. Using dissected LacZ mosaic murine corneas, we inferred the flow field on the curved surface by following stripe edges, revealing a tightening spiral. To explain the flow fields, we developed a cell-level, in silico model of the mouse cornea. Corneal epithelial cells were treated as mechanically soft, self-propelled particles with density-dependent proliferation and extrusion rates, and noisy alignment of the direction of migration. Even without any global guidance cues, the model predicted that migration patterns form stripes and spirals closely recapitulating those in the experiment. To understand the origin and properties of this flow field, we complemented the particle-based model with a continuum description of cell flux on the cornea that generalises the XYZ hypothesis of steady-state balance between cell divisions and extrusions. The work, therefore, demonstrates how the physics of swarms on curved surfaces can provide quantitative explanations of biological processes at the tissue scale.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The transparent cornea, the most anterior structure of the vertebrate eye, consists of a hypocellular, collagenous stroma covered by a stratified epithelium, resting on an inner endothelial monolayer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Forrester et al., 2020</xref>). The corneal epithelium, which is contiguous with the conjunctival epithelium that covers the rest of the anterior of the eye and the inner edge of the eyelids, is a paradigm model of tissue maintenance by stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Cotsarelis et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Lavker et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Lehrer et al., 1998</xref>). Cells are constantly lost from the corneal surface by abrasion and must be replaced. Multiple lines of evidence have shown that the stem cells that maintain the corneal epithelium reside in a narrow ring at the edge of the cornea, at the boundary between the corneal and conjunctival stem cells – the limbus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Cotsarelis et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Richardson et al., 2017</xref>). Limbal epithelial stem cells themselves are organised as an outer ring of slow-cycling, label-retaining cells that most likely contribute to corneal regeneration after wounding, and an inner layer of rapidly dividing cells that contribute to normal corneal homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Altshuler et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Farrelly et al., 2021</xref>). Stem cells in the basal layer of the limbal epithelium divide and produce proliferative, undifferentiated ‘transit-amplifying’ (TA) cells that migrate into the corneal epithelium to replace those lost during normal life. Studies of human ‘hurricane’ keratopathies and mosaic patterns of cell staining in genetically tagged rodents, frogs and fish have shown that the tracks of migrating cells show a remarkable, regular, radial pattern in the uninjured corneal epithelium, usually with a central vortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Bron and Tripathi, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Dua et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Collinson et al., 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Nagasaki and Zhao, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Iannaccone et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Di Girolamo et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Nejad et al., 2015</xref>). The pinwheel patterns of cell staining observed suggest that migration is highly regular and potentially globally coordinated. The vortices of cell motion patterns observed at the corneal epithelial centre resemble a logarithmic spiral and lend themselves to mathematical analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Iannaccone et al., 2012</xref>). Modelling suggests the spiralling may correlate with tension vectors due to intraocular pressure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Nejad et al., 2015</xref>), but there are no empirical studies suggesting how it might occur in vivo.</p>
<p>The drivers for directed cell migration across the ocular surface are poorly known. Various mechanisms have been suggested, including chemorepulsion from vascular components at the limbus, population pressure from the highly proliferative peripheral corneal epithelium, biased cell loss near the corneal centre, electrical currents caused by ion leakage through abrasion, and contact-mediated cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Bron and Tripathi, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Buck, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Sharma and Coles, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Lemp and Mathers, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Lavker et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Wolosin et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">McCaig et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Foster et al., 2014</xref>). Patterns of cell migration are known to be disrupted, at least temporarily, by wounding, and in disease states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Collinson et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Mort et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Richardson et al., 2018</xref>). The planar polarity protein, Vangl2, is required for normal in vivo patterns of cell migration, suggesting aligned cell-cell interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Findlay et al., 2016</xref>). Corneal epithelial cell migration can be directed in a contact-mediated manner by substrate topography, and an integrin-mediated, cAMP-dependent interaction with their basement membrane may maintain some degree of radial orientation of migrating cells in vitro but is not sufficient to push all cells in a centripetal direction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Walczysko et al., 2016</xref>). A major centripetal driver may be a step-change increase in substrate compliance at the limbal-corneal boundary (from soft to hard substrate) causing limbal cells to make an initial durotactic movement into the cornea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Walczysko et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Gouveia et al., 2019</xref>).</p>
<p>However, it has not been shown experimentally whether these genetic couplings or mechanical and extrinsic directional cues would be enough to produce stable patterns of long-distance migration in vivo. Understanding the coordinated, highly patterned, constrained collective migration patterns of the corneal epithelial cell sheet in vivo is a complex three-dimensional biological problem requiring an integrated, systems-based resolution that goes beyond the individual contributing elements.</p>
<p>Such an in silico model of in vivo ocular surface maintenance that produces radial striping is not conceptually difficult, and coordinate-based models based on cell proliferation dynamics and/or cell density have been proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Lobo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Moraki et al., 2019</xref>). They, however, have unsatisfactory aspects from a biological and predictive perspective. A good model needs to explain, not simply describe, both the formation and maintenance of stripes and the central spiral of cell movement, within a confluent cell sheet. It needs to be formulated in three dimensions to account for the curvature of the cornea, to be quantitative and scaleable, in both size and simulation times, and to apply to corneas of different shapes; importantly, it needs realistic local dynamics of physical cell-cell interactions, incorporate active cell migration and planar alignment, and to make no assumptions about cell behaviour or guidance that are not rooted in observations.</p>
<p>The physics of active or living matter seeks to understand the collective properties of individually motile agents, such as birds, fish, bacteria or eukaryotic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Vicsek and Zafeiris, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Marchetti et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Needleman and Dogic, 2017</xref>). One of its hallmarks is a state of collective migration, or ‘flocking’ that generally appears when agents <italic>locally</italic> coordinate their motion, without the need for a leader or guidance cue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Vicsek et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Giardina, 2008</xref>). Such flocking collectives where the directions of motion are all aligned with each other are known as polar active materials. The apparent flocking behaviour of cells across the corneal surface, together with known behaviours of individual cells, such as self-propulsion, local coordination, contact-mediated cell proliferation and differentiation, leads us to hypothesise that a collective migration model rooted in the physics of soft active matter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Alert and Trepat, 2020</xref>) can explain the observed in vivo migration patterns.</p>
<p>Within the framework of active matter, it has become clear that the system’s topology plays a prominent role. For example, a sphere is a closed surface with no holes, with an associated topological invariant, the Euler characteristic <italic>χ</italic> = 2, loosely speaking, a number that describes an object’s shape regardless of how it is bent. A mathematical consequence is that the velocity profile of any flow confined to the surface of a sphere has to vanish at least at one point. Flocks, therefore, cannot maintain fully aligned velocities everywhere on the surface, and instead create points with locally mismatched directions. Near such ‘singular points’, if one loops over a contour encompassing it, the flow field winds an integer number of times (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Do Carmo, 2016</xref>). Such points are known as <italic>topological defects</italic> with <italic>topological charge c</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Mermin, 1979</xref>). Pictorially, +1 defects are circular objects corresponding to inward, outward or spiral flows around the defect core, while −1 defects have four-leaf clover symmetry, with flow inwards along two directions and outwards along the orthogonal ones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Alexander et al., 2012</xref>). The Poincaré-Hopf theorem requires that the total topological charge equals the Euler number, i.e. ∑<sub><italic>i</italic></sub> <italic>c</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> = <italic>χ</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Do Carmo, 2016</xref>). Flocks of active particles on a sphere then typically generate patterns consisting of a circling band and two vortex-like +1 topological defects at the poles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Sknepnek and Henkes, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Shankar et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Hsu et al., 2022</xref>).</p>
<p>The cornea, with the limbal boundary, is a spherical cap, i.e. it has the same topology as a disk. In this topology, with Euler characteristic <italic>χ</italic> = 1, if the flows close to the boundary are uniform as for the cornea, we expect at least one topological defect with charge +1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Stein, 1979</xref>). We propose that this is the vortex pattern corresponding to the central spiral of the cornea. Indeed, in an in vitro collective cell system with a disk topology, such a spiral defect was described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Guillamat et al., 2022</xref>). Pictorially, the migration pattern for the cornea is akin to water flowing in from a source and then circling down a sink, except that we can create and extrude cells everywhere within the sheet. Additionally, biological development can also mould the surfaces themselves and then generate deformations that couple to topological defects – as has recently been shown for hydra (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Maroudas-Sacks et al., 2021</xref>), and argued to play an important role for organoids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Rozman et al., 2020</xref>).</p>
<p>In this paper, we build a quantitative model of spiral flocking on the cornea. We previously showed that the swirling migration patterns of confluent corneal epithelial cell monolayers in vitro can be understood using a model of active matter at high densities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Henkes et al., 2020</xref>), and that one can include mechanical coordination between cells as polar alignment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Saraswathibhatla et al., 2021</xref>). The model treats each cell as a soft particle, able to self-propel, align its planar polarity with, and exert elastic forces on its neighbours.</p>
<p>These features are accounted for by a set of equations of motion that are evolved in time to simulate swirling spatiotemporally correlated patterns of cell motion observed in in vitro experiments. The model is quantitative, and its parameters can be directly derived from experimental observation. Here, we extend this model of corneal epithelial cell migration to a three-dimensional constrained geometry that recapitulates the mouse cornea, with stem cells at the limbus and proliferating TA cells within the cornea. The model produces radial striping flow patterns with a central spiral representing a +1 topological defect that replicates the spiral flow patterns of cell migration observed in vivo. We link flocking spiral formation to effective resurfacing of the cornea, and reformulate the XYZ hypothesis of corneal maintenance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Thoft and Friend, 1983</xref>) in physical terms. We are thus able to demonstrate the central role of confinement and curved geometry in corneal patterning. This model represents the first comprehensive, predictive tool for understanding the maintenance of the ocular surface in health and disease.</p>

<p><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1a</xref> shows a representative X-linked LacZ-transgenic adult female mouse cornea, with a pin-wheel spiral pattern of β-galactosidase mosaicism due to the flow of cells from patches of blue and white stem cells at the periphery (limbus) to the corneal centre throughout adult life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Collinson et al., 2002</xref>). The patterns of cell migration are reflected by the projection of sensory axons between the cells in the basal layer, which largely follow the flow of epithelial cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1b</xref>). Both axons and cells form a smooth flow pattern with a vortex at the corneal centre. This vortex is an example of a topological defect (i.e. a point where the orientational order of cell velocity vectors vanishes) with a +1 topological charge. We hypothesise that the flow pattern and the central topological defect can be explained as an emergent behaviour of a collective of self-propelled epithelial cells closely packed on a hemisphere. As a differential hypothesis, epithelial cells on a substrate have been described as an active nematic material (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Saw et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Balasubramaniam et al., 2021</xref>), where elongated cells or the stresses of the cells pulling on each other generate topological defects with ±1<italic>/</italic>2 charges (topological defects with ‘half-integer’ charges are allowed if the field has nematic, i.e. head-tail symmetry). Despite the compatible elongated shape of the axons, we do not observe such defects, which for a +1<italic>/</italic>2 defect resemble a fold in a material made of long, thin objects. Instead, in rare occurrences, additional pairs of +1 and −1 defects occur in axon patterning (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1c</xref>). We infer that here the polar, crawling motility of the cells dominates over cell-cell stresses with nematic symmetry. Therefore, cell motion in a cornea is an example of a dense polar soft active matter system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Marchetti et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Alert and Trepat, 2020</xref>).</p>

<p>To test this hypothesis, we reconstructed the epithelial cell flow fields across the corneal surface, by dissecting, flattening and imaging corneas as described in <italic>Materials and Methods</italic>. We manually traced boundaries between blue and white stripes from images of <italic>n</italic> = 8 dissected wild-type adult XLacZ corneas in Inkscape (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9</xref>). We wrote custom analysis software in MATLAB to digitally reconstruct the cornea surface in 3D and then inferred the local cell flow directions from the stripe edges. Finally, we minimised an XY model of polar alignment to interpolate between known directions. This enabled us to infer the direction of velocity vectors everywhere on the cornea. In <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2a</xref>, we show a two-dimensional projection of the flow pattern along the curved corneal surface inferred from one of the corneas (experiment 1).

Owing to the nearly spherical shape of the eye, we used spherical coordinates to identify points on the cornea. We placed the origin at the centre of the eye, and the location of the +1 topological defect represents the ‘north pole’, such that the <italic>z</italic>−axis passes through it (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2c</xref>). The angle <italic>θ</italic> with <italic>θ</italic> = 0° being the spiral centre then measured the angular distance from the pole (like an inverse latitude), where <italic>θ</italic> ≈ 70° corresponds to the limbal region at the periphery of the cornea. We measured the azimuthal direction by the angle <italic>ϕ</italic>, with values between 0° and 360°, with an arbitrary origin as the cornea is radially symmetric.</p>
<p>The spherical coordinates allowed us to define local unit reference vectors <bold>ê</bold><sub><italic>θ</italic></sub> and <bold>ê</bold><sub><italic>ϕ</italic></sub> in the tangent plane of the corneal surface. Then we defined <italic>α</italic> as the angle between −<bold>ê</bold><sub><italic>θ</italic></sub> and the direction of the velocity vector <bold>v</bold> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2c</xref>). Here the minus sign ensures that |<italic>α</italic>| &lt; 90° for an inward flow, as <bold>ê</bold><sub><italic>θ</italic></sub> points outwards by convention.</p>
<p>The flow pattern is clearly highly symmetric along the azimuthal direction. Therefore, we averaged <italic>α</italic> over the angle <italic>ϕ</italic> to extract the characteristic spiral angle flow profile <italic>α</italic>(<italic>θ</italic>), as a function of the polar angle <italic>θ</italic> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2b</xref>). Although both clockwise and counterclockwise patterns were approximately equally likely, we flipped the sign of angle <italic>α</italic> on clockwise-rotating corneas for visual clarity. This enabled us to identify a reproducible pattern for all corneas: Flow is straight inward near the corneal edge with <italic>α</italic>(<italic>θ</italic> = 70°) ≈ 0 and stays such until at an angle <italic>θ</italic> ≈ 15° − 25°, when <italic>α</italic>(<italic>θ</italic>) sharply increases, corresponding to a systematic tilt of <bold>v</bold>, i.e. the onset of a spiral. In all cases, the spiral angle further continuously tightened until reaching <italic>α</italic>(<italic>θ</italic> = 70°) ≈ 90° at the corneal centre, corresponding to flow in the azimuthal direction.</p>
<p>Finally, we identified topological defects in the flow field by computing angle differences over the loops defined by a Delaunay triangulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Zapotocky et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Henkes et al., 2018</xref>) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2d</xref>). We always found a single +1 topological defect surrounded by a spiral, located near the centre of the cornea (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2a</xref> and <xref rid="fig2_S2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2 – Figure Supplement 2</xref>).</p>

<title>Excluding prepatterning as the stripe formation mechanisms</title>
<p>Patterns of radial striping are potentially explicable if the corneal epithelial cells are aligned by a global patterning mechanism that, e.g. biases cell migration or aligns cell division axes to point towards the cornea centre.</p>
<p>To test whether the cell migration direction is biased, we used the centrosome. The position of the centrosome has been associated with cell polarity, motility, and division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Nigg and Raff, 2009</xref>). Intracellular movement of the centrosome has been shown both in vivo and in wound assays in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Werner et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Blitzer et al., 2011</xref>). Hence, the position of the centrosome relative to the nucleus can act as a proxy measurement for the cell polarity and, potentially, the direction of migration. To assay whether the corneal epithelial cells have an intrinsic directional polarity, we performed immunohistochemistry to visualise pericentrin in flat-mounted corneas and measured the angle of the centrosome-nuclear axis <italic>ϕ</italic> with respect to the corneal centre (6 eyes, 879 cells) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3a,b</xref>). Centrosomes were either behind the nucleus (0°−180°) (42±1%), in front of the nucleus (51 ± 2 %), or directly above or below the nucleus with no orientation (6 ± 1%). Statistically, there was a slight but significant tendency for centrosomes to locate in front of the nucleus (<italic>p</italic> = 0.0047), consistent with the observed mean flow towards the cornea centre. However, the overall scattered pattern of centrosomes with respect to the nucleus is more consistent with short-term changes in migration directions associated with the local cell environment than with any global patterning.</p>

<p>To investigate whether radially-aligned cell division axes contributed to observed striping patterns, we identified mitotic figures in DAPI-stained flat-mounted corneas from adult mice as shown in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>.

<title>Soft active particle model</title>
<p>With the prepatterning mechanism being unlikely, we constructed an agent-based model that is able to explain the observed radial migration and spiral patterns as emergent phenomena rooted in the physics of soft active matter. To set the stage before analysing the effects of curvature, we first developed a planar model. As discussed in the next section, the planar model can be parametrised using corneal explants and monolayers of primary mouse corneal epithelial cells.</p>
<p>The corneal epithelium is stratified, but the active migration is performed solely by the basal layer of cells, with the more apical layers essentially riding passively on the basal flow. For simplicity, therefore we modelled the corneal epithelium as a single sheet of cells, themselves modelled as soft disks. Each disk has a soft repulsive core, which sets the cell radius <italic>σ</italic> and accounts for elastic repulsion between overlapping neighbours. In addition, cell-cell adhesion with their neighbours is modelled via a short-range attractive potential. We introduced cell migration on the basement membrane covering the stroma through an active self-propulsion force that randomly changes its direction over time, reorienting the direction of a cell’s migration. We also allowed cells to divide or be extruded with rates <italic>d</italic><sub><italic>z</italic></sub> and <italic>a</italic>, respectively. In this case, ‘extrusion’ represents the differentiation of basal epithelial cells and their movement into the apical layers of the epithelium in vivo. We modelled cell division as density-dependent, where the rate of cell division <italic>d</italic><sub><italic>z</italic></sub> = <italic>d</italic><sub>0</sub>(1 − <italic>z/z</italic><sub>max</sub>) depends on the local cell density through the number of nearest neighbours, <italic>z</italic>, and allows the tissue to reach homeostasis when the rate of production of cells by division equals the rate of extrusion, and <italic>d</italic><sub>0</sub> and <italic>z</italic><sub>max</sub> are parameters that set the actual numerical value of <italic>d</italic><sub><italic>z</italic></sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Matoz-Fernandez et al., 2017</xref>). On the other hand, we assumed the extrusion rate <italic>a</italic> to be fixed and independent of the local cell density.</p>
<p>Furthermore, cells can coordinate their migration direction through a combination of chemical or mechanical cues. For corneal cells, the detailed mechanochemistry is unknown. However, for the extensively studied MDCK epithelial cell lines, many types of coordination have been proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Alert and Trepat, 2020</xref>), such as plithotaxis, i.e. reorientation of the migration direction with the mechanical stress that it experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Trepat and Fredberg, 2011</xref>). Here, in the absence of information about cellular stresses and the observation of a directional global flow, we assumed two simultaneously acting mechanisms by which a cell can reorient its direction of migration, i.e. reorientation in response to the local force feedback (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Henkes et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Petrolli et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Baconnier et al., 2024</xref>) and alignment with its nearest neighbours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Saraswathibhatla et al., 2021</xref>). If sufficiently strong, both can cause cells to ‘flock’, i.e. to collectively migrate in the same direction akin to a flock of birds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Giardina, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Vicsek and Zafeiris, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>We describe the active crawling force <bold><italic>F</italic></bold><sub>act</sub> of the cell labelled by index <italic>i</italic> with a magnitude |<bold><italic>F</italic></bold><sub>act</sub>| = <italic>ζ ν</italic><sub>0</sub> and a unit-length direction vector <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="608002v1_inline1.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>, where <italic>ϑ</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> is the angle between <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="608002v1_inline2.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> and the <italic>x</italic>−axis of the cell sheet plane, spanned by unit-length vectors <bold>ê</bold><sub>x</sub> and <bold>ê</bold><sub>y</sub>.

The dynamics of the active migration direction is determined by alignment with the cell’s velocity angle <italic>Ψ</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> (first term in square brackets) and pair alignment with the cell’s nearest neighbours (second term in square brackets), with added rotational white noise <italic>η</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> with time correlation ⟨<italic>η</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>(<italic>t</italic>)<italic>η</italic><sub><italic>j</italic></sub>(<italic>t</italic><sup>′</sup>) ⟩ = 2<italic>D</italic><sub><italic>r</italic></sub><italic>δ</italic><sub><italic>ij</italic></sub> <italic>δ</italic>(<italic>t</italic> − <italic>t</italic><sup>′</sup>). <italic>D</italic><sub><italic>r</italic></sub> is the rotation diffusion constant and it sets the cell motion persistence time <italic>τ</italic> = 1<italic>/D</italic><sub><italic>r</italic></sub>, i.e. the typical time a cell takes to reorient its migration direction.

<p>We briefly comment on the choice of a model with polar symmetry. Epithelial cells can generate mechanical stresses, which enable them to exert forces on the substrate and their neighbours. In many cases, those forces are dipolar and thus result from stresses with nematic (i.e. head-tail) symmetry. Among other things, the nematic symmetry leads to the appearance of ±1<italic>/</italic>2 topological defects in the cell-shape texture and active turbulence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Shankar et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Blanch-Mercader et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Duclos et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Mueller et al., 2019</xref>), phenomena that can be successfully explained using models for active nematics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Doostmohammadi et al., 2018</xref>). Dipolar active force cannot cause a single cell to migrate, and the flow is an emergent collective phenomenon. Epithelial cells can, however, also generate polar (i.e. directional) self-propulsion forces that can cause a single cell to crawl. Forces with polar symmetry can explain, e.g. observed velocity correlations in confluent epithelial sheets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Henkes et al., 2020</xref>). This highlights that cells can generate and transmit complex mechanical stresses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Armengol-Collado et al., 2023</xref>) that can lead to rich and only partly understood collective behaviours.</p>
<p>Although we do not exclude the possibility that active nematic stresses are present in corneal cells, as mentioned already, the absence of half-integer topological defects suggests that predominant mechanical forces have polar symmetry. This makes a model with self-propelled agents subject to polar alignment appropriate to describe cell migration of corneal cells. We stress that the term ‘polar’ refers to the symmetry of active mechanical forces and not to the internal cell polarity.</p>

<title>Extracting model parameters from experiment</title>
<p>To parametrise the model, we experimentally measured cell sizes, velocities, flow patterns, and cell division orientation for mouse corneal epithelial cells.</p>
<p>We determined cell migration speeds by time-lapse analysis in cultured mouse corneal explants (labelled ‘explants’), and also in monolayers of primary mouse corneal epithelial cells cultured on a substrate as described in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Hazlett et al., 1996</xref>) (labelled ‘plastic’) (see <italic>Materials and Methods</italic>), with the results shown in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>. The in vivo epithelium moves over a basement membrane on a collagenous stroma, a substrate with different mechanical properties compared to tissue culture plastic. This is consistent with the emerging understanding that there is a trade-off of the active stresses arising from the cytoskeleton between contractility at the apical surface and traction with the substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Ladoux and Mège, 2017</xref>). Therefore, in this study, we adjusted the main size parameter, cell radius and migration speed <italic>ν</italic><sub>0</sub> of modelled cells to match the explant data derived empirically (summarised in <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<p>We estimated the mean planar radius of basal corneal epithelial cells in vivo by microscopy in flat-mount and tissue sections to be <italic>σ</italic> ≈ 5 − 6 µm. Cells in the tissue culture on ‘plastic’ were larger, with an estimated radius of <italic>σ</italic> ≈ 11 µm. Therefore, we used <italic>σ</italic> = 5 µm for simulations of explants and, subsequently, the full cornea simulations, and <italic>σ</italic> = 11 µm for simulating monolayers grown on ‘plastic’.</p>
<p>Next, we investigated the cell migration patterns using particle-image velocimetry (PIV) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Adrian, 1991</xref>) on phase-contrast images of the confluent cell layers. In comparison to our previous PIV analysis of HCE-S cell monolayers that found the root mean squared velocity <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="608002v1_inline3.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> to be 12± 2 µm/h (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Henkes et al., 2020</xref>), <italic>ν</italic><sub>rms</sub> was higher (15 − 25 µm/h) for mouse monolayers in tissue culture (‘plastic’), but lower (2 − 6 µm/h) for mouse epithelial cells in whole corneal explants moving on the endogenous stroma (‘explant’), see <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4a</xref>. In combination with previous measurements of corneal epithelial wound healing migration of up to 60 µm/h in vitro and in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Leiper et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Garcia et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Walczysko et al., 2016</xref>), these data set the range of cell velocities biologically permissible for the model. Examples of this collective cell motion together with the velocity field inferred from PIV are shown in supplementary videos S1 and S2 for explant and plastic conditions, respectively.</p>
<p>The mean cell cycle time in basal corneal mouse epithelial cells has been measured previously to be ≈ 3.5 − 5.0 days (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Sagga et al., 2018</xref>), with individual basal epithelial cells capable of division once every 2.5 days (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Lehrer et al., 1998</xref>), compared to 1 - 1.5 days in HCE-S cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Henkes et al., 2020</xref>). To create a quantitative model of a homeostatic system where the rate of cell loss matches the rate of cell division, we first set the cell extrusion rate <italic>a</italic> to the inverse of the observed cell cycle time, resulting in <italic>a</italic> = 0.02 h<sup>−1</sup> (i.e., 50 hours between divisions). This rate was then applied in both ‘plastic’ and ‘explant’ matching simulations. We then chose <italic>d</italic><sub><italic>z</italic></sub> to be compatible with the observed confluent tissue densities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Matoz-Fernandez et al., 2017</xref>). The cell-cell interaction potential strength <italic>k</italic> and the cell-substrate friction coefficient <italic>ζ</italic> are difficult to estimate individually, but fortunately, they enter the model only through their ratio. We, therefore, used <italic>k/ζ</italic> = 55 h<sup>−1</sup> extracted in vitro for HCE-S cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Henkes et al., 2020</xref>) as the starting value of the fitting process. To match the experimental field of view, we simulated a system of size 867 × 662 µm<sup>2</sup>. We estimated the cell migration speed in isolation <italic>ν</italic><sub>0</sub> and the alignment strength <italic>J</italic> through measuring <italic>ν</italic><sub>rms</sub> and the flocking order parameter <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="608002v1_inline4.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Vicsek et al., 1995</xref>), which varies between 0 (random migration directions) and 1 (full flock migration). In <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4a-b</xref>, we show <italic>ν</italic><sub>rms</sub> and Φ<sub>v</sub> for experiments and simulations. As mentioned above, cells on plastic are considerably faster than explants, and we used <italic>ν</italic><sub>0</sub> = 30 µm/h (<italic>ν</italic><sub>0</sub> = 3 µm/h) for simulations of experiments on ‘plastic’ (‘explants’). Qualitatively, the observed difference in speed is due to explant cells being tall and narrow with few focal adhesions, while cells on plastic are spread out with strong cytoskeletal coupling to the substrate. We found that the observed values of the flocking parameter, Φ<sub>v</sub> = 0.3 − 0.7, were incompatible with <italic>J</italic> = 0 h<sup>−1</sup> used to model the HCE-S data in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Henkes et al., 2020</xref>). Instead, we found a good simultaneous match to <italic>ν</italic><sub>rms</sub> and Φ<sub>v</sub> in the range <italic>J</italic> = 0.1 − 0.2 h<sup>−1</sup>, as befits the considerable variance between experimental repeats, and consistent with results for MDCK sheets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Saraswathibhatla et al., 2021</xref>). This range corresponds to the region of the flocking phase transition in our model, a first hint that this transition provides the mechanism responsible for the stripe formation process in vivo.</p>
<p>As we show in videos S1 and S2, cells in the sheet moved coherently over many cell sizes. We finished the analysis by matching cell velocity-velocity correlations in space and time. The time correlation of cell velocities is defined as ⟨<bold>v</bold>(<italic>t</italic>) ⋅ <bold>v</bold>(0) ⟩, where ⟨… ⟩ is the average over all cells and all time points along cell trajectories that are time <italic>t</italic> apart, and it measures how long it takes cells to change their migration direction, as shown in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4e-f</xref> for ‘explants’ (top) and ‘plastic’ (bottom). In both cases, while variable, the experimental correlation decays over several hours, with longer correlation times for the tissue culture plastic. As before, we chose a simulated value of the cell persistence time <italic>τ</italic> = 2 h, which together with <italic>J</italic> = 0.1 − 0.2 h<sup>−1</sup> brackets the values extracted from experiments. The simulations above the flocking threshold showed a long-time correlation plateau as do most experiments.</p>
<p>Finally, we obtained the Fourier velocity correlation function ⟨ |<bold>v</bold>(<italic>q</italic>) |<sup>2</sup>⟩ as average of the square modulus of the spatial Fourier transform of the velocity field, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="608002v1_inline5.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>. As shown in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4c-d</xref>, it measures which wavelengths contribute to cell motion, and is characterised by a decay beyond a spatial correlation length <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="608002v1_inline6.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>, where <italic>μ</italic> is the shear modulus, which is set by the particle elastic stiffness through <italic>k/ζ</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Henkes et al., 2020</xref>).</p>
<p>For both ‘plastic’ and ‘explant’ data, we obtained good agreement for the low modes <italic>q</italic> ≲ 2<italic>π/ξ</italic> where the continuum approach is valid, giving a final value of <italic>k/ζ</italic> = 30 h<sup>−1</sup>, similar to other epithelial sheets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Henkes et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Saraswathibhatla et al., 2021</xref>). Supplementary videos S3 and S4 show our matched simulations at <italic>J</italic> = 0.15 h<sup>−1</sup> for explant and plastic conditions, respectively.</p>

<title>Corneal surface model</title>
<p>To combine active cell dynamics with the realistic three-dimensional corneal shape, we modelled the cornea as a spherical cap of radius <italic>R</italic> = 100 − 1500 µm and a 70° opening, consistent with experimental measurements. The corneal epithelial cells, i.e. the TA cells derived from stem cell divisions in the limbus, were modelled as soft particles able to migrate on the curved surface, divide, and be removed. To ensure that the cells remain confined to the surface throughout the simulation, we projected the velocity vectors onto the local tangent planes at each time step. The equations of motion, therefore, contain the same term as in the flat case, eqn. (1), with additional projection operators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Sknepnek and Henkes, 2015</xref>) (see <italic>Materials and Methods</italic>). The model parameters, listed as ‘explants’ in <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, were determined as discussed in the previous section. At the bottom boundary, we modelled the limbal stem cell niche as a single layer of continuously dividing cells, a simplification that takes into account both dividing stem cells and a population of TA cells that may divide before leaving the limbus. In the mouse limbal epithelium, slow-cycling stem cells, comprising approximately 25% of the cell population, were previously determined to divide once every 10 - 20 days with the other 75% of rapidly dividing cells having a cell cycle time of 3 - 3.5 days (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Sagga et al., 2018</xref>). To match the above and the empirically determined corneal resurfacing time of 14 days at full-size, we chose a density-independent division rate of <italic>d</italic><sub><italic>L</italic></sub> = 0.4 h<sup>−1</sup> for the limbal ring.</p>
<p>Finally, we included a double ring of tightly spaced stiff cells as a barrier to constrain motion to the interior of the cornea area. This reflects experimental observations that the progeny of limbal epithelial stem cells never migrate outwards into the conjunctiva. We recapitulated the lineage tracing provided by XLacZ staining by separating the cells into ‘blue’ and ‘white’ types. Each ‘blue’ limbal stem cell gives rise to ‘blue’ TA cells, which can also only divide further into more ‘blue’ cells, as in vivo. We used the same dynamics for the ‘white’ cells. Blue and white cells were identical in their interactions and they could mix freely. We set the base for the stripes to 12 alternating regions of fixed stem cells along the limbal stem cell line (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>). For the initial set-up of simulations, we randomly seeded cells with a 50:50 ‘blue’:’white’ mixture on the corneal surface. For the largest cornea radii <italic>R</italic><sub>c</sub> = 1000 µm and <italic>R</italic><sub>c</sub> = 1500 µm, due to computational limitations, we started with an empty corneal surface. As above, we implemented the model through custom configuration files and initialisation scripts in our package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">SAMoS, 2024</xref>). We simulated between 1400 cells at <italic>R</italic><sub>c</sub> = 100 µm, and 241 000 cells at <italic>R</italic><sub>c</sub> = 1500 µm. We ran the simulations using an Euler-Maruyama algorithm for 500 000 simulation time steps at <italic>dt</italic> = 0.001 h, corresponding to 20.8 days of development.

<title>Emergence of the spiral pattern</title>
<p>The corneal spiral is not present from birth (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6a</xref>): Young XLacZ mice exhibit a random patch-work arrangement of blue and white clones from mosaic LacZ expression of cells. Cell loss stimulates the immigration of cells into the cornea from the limbal epithelium, such that by adulthood the patterns resolve as the spiral radial arrangement of clones. The transition from a primarily patchwork to a primarily striped pattern takes 3 - 4 weeks, with intermediate patterns with stripes emerging from the periphery, retaining a patchwork centre. We were able to successfully reproduce both this transition and the spiral striping pattern using numerical simulations of the corneal surface model. In <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6b-e</xref>, we show the time evolution of a simulated cornea of radius <italic>R</italic> = 700 µm. As can be seen in the second row (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6b</xref> and accompanying supplementary video S6), the initially randomly distributed ‘blue’ and ‘white’ cell pattern was gradually replaced by a striped pattern made of cells derived from the limbus. This was not simply a case of cells being replaced since the change happened over several generations of cells, with the overwhelming majority of striping pattern cells being derived from other corneal epithelial TA cells. By day 20, a cornea with a stable central spiral emerged. This pattern of replacement, including the time scale over which it occurred, was very similar to the corneal evolution observed in neonatal mice shown in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6a</xref>. We can understand the emergence of the spiral flow pattern by examining the temporally averaged (or hydrodynamic) velocity field (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6c</xref> and supplementary video S7), where we tracked the displacement Δ<bold>r</bold><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>(<italic>t</italic>) = <bold>r</bold><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>(<italic>t</italic> + Δ<italic>/</italic>2) − <bold>r</bold><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>(<italic>t</italic> − Δ<italic>/</italic>2) of each surviving cell <italic>i</italic> over Δ<italic>t</italic> = 2.5 h, giving <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="608002v1_inline7.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>. This is distinct from the instantaneous cell migration speed <bold>v</bold><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> which was more random, consistent with the nearly random cell orientations seen in experiments (cf. <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3b</xref>). <xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Figure 10</xref> in the <italic>Materials and Methods</italic> shows how the smooth hydrodynamic flow pattern emerges as we increase the averaging time Δ<italic>t</italic>. The hydrodynamic velocity field gradually forms a spiral pattern with flow parallel to the blue/white stripe edges of the spiral. This confirmed our experimental approach of inferring the flow field direction from the stripe edges.</p>

<p>We next quantified our observations by tracking the +1 and −1 topological defects of <bold>v</bold><sup>H</sup>, shown in white and black, respectively in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6c</xref>. As discussed above, topological defects correspond to regions where the flow field is discontinuous, with +1 defects being circular objects with spiral flows around the defect core, while −1 defects have four-fold inward/outward symmetry. We computed topological defect charges <italic>c</italic> using the same discrete sum around Delaunay triangles of a tesselation constructed from the particle positions as for the experiment (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2d</xref>), and further merged the charges of defects recursively within 15 µm, to avoid regions of small-scale disordered flow dominating our measurements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Henkes et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Prathyusha et al., 2018</xref>).

Since the cornea is topologically a disk, i.e. a surface with a boundary, in general, the total topological charge is influenced by that boundary. However, due to flows being uniformly inward close to the limbal region, the sum of the topological charges is expected to be +1, i.e. <italic>N</italic><sub>+1</sub> − <italic>N</italic><sub>−1</sub> = 1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Stein, 1979</xref>). We indeed observed that as the simulated cornea matures, +1 and −1 defects were initially very numerous and then reduced until only one central, +1 topological spiral defect remained, which corresponded to the centre of the blue-white spiral. In <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6d</xref>, we show the polar angle of the ±1 defects as a function of time. One can clearly see the mutual annihilation of +1 and −1 defects such that by day 8, only the central +1 defect remained. Here the top graph corresponds to the defects of the flow field shown in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6b</xref>, and the bottom graph corresponds to the director field, i.e. the field of directions of migration of individual cells. <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6e</xref> shows the spatial trajectory of the central defect superimposed on the flow pattern, again for velocity and director defects. Both show that the central defect is almost stationary and nearly identical for velocity and director defects. These measures all show that the flow field pattern is a direct result of the polar alignment of the cells, i.e. the spiral pattern indeed emerges from the interaction between flocking and hemispherical geometry.</p>

</fig>
<p>From these simulations, we made a key observation: polar alignment is necessary for spiral formation, and the cornea is not effectively resurfaced in its absence. For example, in the bottom grey oval in <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7a</xref>, we show the flow field (left) and a snapshot of cell configuration (right) for <italic>J</italic> = 0.025 h<sup>−1</sup> and <italic>R</italic> = 500 µm after 20 days. The flow field remained disordered with numerous topological defects and no emerging spiral. Supplementary videos S8 and S9 show the time evolution (or lack theoreof) of this process. Conversely, for <italic>J</italic> = 0.2 h<sup>−1</sup> (top grey oval) we obtained a tighter spiral with a well-developed spiral flow field. Supplementary videos S10 and S11 show the time evolution, including the more rapid appearance of the single central defect.</p>
<p>We quantified these observations by computing azimuthally averaged profiles using spherical coordinates with the central defect along the <italic>z</italic> axis, using the same method as for the experiment (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2c</xref>). In <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figures 7b</xref> and <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7d</xref> we, respectively, show the spiral angle <italic>α</italic> and the mean flow velocity <italic>ν</italic><sup><italic>H</italic></sup> as a function of polar angle <italic>θ</italic>. The former is the same measure as in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2b</xref> obtained in experiments. We found a transition between a disordered state with small <italic>ν</italic><sup><italic>H</italic></sup> in the interior (and thus no effective resurfacing) and no developed spiral for <italic>J</italic> ≤ 0.05 h<sup>−1</sup> and increasingly effective resurfacing for <italic>J</italic> ≥ 0.075 h<sup>−1</sup>, in the same region as the flocking transition in the flat case. Both spiral shape and flow velocity saturated for <italic>J</italic> ≈ 0.2 h<sup>−1</sup>, in the limit where cells fully flock together. Thus, we predict that the emergence of the topological spiral flow due to polar alignment is essential for a healthy cornea.</p>
<p>We observed that a spiral emerges for all simulated cornea radii (<italic>R</italic> = 100 − 1500 µm), showing the robustness of the flocking mechanism. However, the spiral shape is strongly radius-dependent. In <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7c</xref>, we show the spiral angle <italic>α</italic> with the inward direction as a function of polar angle <italic>θ</italic> for different values of <italic>R</italic>. We see that there is a systematic change from a pattern of a wide spiral (large <italic>α</italic> at most <italic>θ</italic>) at small values of <italic>R</italic> to a flux that is nearly straight inwards on the outer areas of the cornea (small <italic>α</italic> at large <italic>θ</italic>) followed by an increasingly sharper spiral pattern near the centre. In all cases, we had <italic>α</italic>(0) → 90°, i.e. a spiral that becomes a vortex at the centre. The flow field <italic>ν</italic><sup><italic>H</italic></sup> (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7e</xref>) shows that all corneas except the smallest reached a steady flow velocity of approximately 2 µm/h on the corneal surface. Near the centre, however, <italic>ν</italic><sup><italic>H</italic></sup> drops to 0 approximately linearly, with an increasingly sharper gradient as the corneal size increases.</p>

<title>The XYZ model revisited</title>
<p>A mainstay of understanding of ocular surface maintenance has been the XYZ hypothesis which states that the amount of cells flowing into the cornea from the limbal stem cell reservoir is exactly balanced by the difference between the amounts of TA cells being born and leaving the cornea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Thoft and Friend, 1983</xref>). In other words, the XYZ hypothesis posits that the cornea is in a steady state with a constant but nonzero flux of cells from the limbus inward to the tip of the cornea. We can test and expand on this hypothesis by writing a continuum conservation law for cell numbers, and apply it to the spiral flow profiles, linking cell flux <bold><italic>v</italic></bold><sup><italic>H</italic></sup>, the spiral angle of the cornea <italic>α</italic>, and the difference between birth and extrusion rates.</p>
<p>The XYZ hypothesis states that the number of cells in a patch of the cornea is, on average, constant. If we denote the number of cells in a patch as <italic>N, N</italic><sub>in</sub> cells flowing into the patch, <italic>N</italic><sub>out</sub> cells flowing out of the patch, <italic>N</italic><sub>d</sub> cells dividing, and <italic>N</italic><sub>a</sub> cells that are extruded, we obtain the following balance relation:
<disp-formula id="eqn2">
<graphic xlink:href="608002v1_eqn2.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula>
</p>
<p>This equation could be reformulated in terms of the density of cells, <italic>ρ</italic> = <italic>N/S</italic>, where <italic>S</italic> is the patch area. The flux <bold>J</bold> = <italic>ρ</italic><bold>v</bold><sup><italic>H</italic></sup> is the mean number of cells with velocity <bold>v</bold><sup><italic>H</italic></sup> flowing through the boundary of <italic>S</italic> per unit time. Similarly, we can define <italic>d</italic>(<italic>ρ</italic>) and <italic>a</italic>(<italic>ρ</italic>), the division and death rates per cell. Eqn. (2) can then be reformulated as a flux conservation or continuity equation (see <italic>Materials and Methods</italic>) that states that the divergence of the flux at each point needs to be balanced by the difference in cells being extruded and those that are dividing at the same point, i.e.
<disp-formula id="eqn3">
<graphic xlink:href="608002v1_eqn3.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula>
</p>
<p>It is possible to link this equation with the XYZ hypothesis as follows. We first assume that the flow has a radially symmetric spiral pattern, i.e. <bold>v</bold><sup><italic>H</italic></sup> = <italic>v</italic>(<italic>θ</italic>) cos <italic>α</italic>(<italic>θ</italic>)<bold>e</bold><sub><italic>θ</italic></sub> +sin <italic>α</italic>(<italic>θ</italic>)<bold>e</bold><sub><italic>ϕ</italic></sub>, where <italic>v</italic>(<italic>θ</italic>) = |<bold>v</bold><sup><italic>H</italic></sup>| is its magnitude and <italic>α</italic>(<italic>θ</italic>) is the angle between <bold>v</bold><sub><italic>H</italic></sub> and −<bold>e</bold><sub><italic>θ</italic></sub>. The difference between division and extrusion can be combined into the density-dependent net loss rate <italic>A</italic>(<italic>ρ</italic>) = [<italic>a</italic>(<italic>ρ</italic>) − <italic>d</italic>(<italic>ρ</italic>)]. We further assume that the deviations of <italic>ρ</italic> from its mean are small, though we retain their influence on <italic>A</italic>(<italic>θ</italic>) ≡ <italic>A</italic>(<italic>ρ</italic>(<italic>θ</italic>)). Written in spherical coordinates with the defect along <italic>z</italic> again as in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2d</xref>, eqn. (3) becomes (see <italic>Materials and Methods</italic>),
<disp-formula id="eqn4">
<graphic xlink:href="608002v1_eqn4.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula>
</p>
<p>This equation links the spiral angle profile <italic>α</italic>(<italic>θ</italic>), shown in <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figures 7b</xref> and <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7c</xref> with its velocity profile <italic>v</italic>(<italic>θ</italic>) (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figures 7d</xref> and <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7e</xref>) through the net loss rate <italic>A</italic>(<italic>θ</italic>) which we show for the simulations in <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figures 8b-d</xref>. We immediately see that <italic>A</italic>(<italic>θ</italic>) has a distinct emerging angular profile, despite cell division and extrusion in the model incorporating no spatial information. In particular, we note that for small values of the alignment strength <italic>J</italic>, where the system cannot form a spiral, there is a strongly positive <italic>A</italic> at large <italic>θ</italic>, near the limbus. This corresponds to a ‘traffic jam’ of cells stuck near their place of birth that are extruded before being able to migrate up the surface. In contrast, for spiral forming configurations, <italic>A</italic> &lt; 0 near the limbus, signalling an enhanced birth rate and lower extrusion rate is balanced by a higher extrusion rate near the centre.

The delicate density-dependent balance that links division, death and velocity magnitude in our system however complicates this: the appropriate symmetry class are the ‘Malthusian’ flocks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Toner, 2012</xref>), which include division and death. However, the strong approximations inherent in this approach, most notably that <italic>A</italic> = 0 and that <italic>v</italic> is constant, independent of cell density, make them insufficiently detailed to explain the corneal flux.

<title>Discussion</title>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>We introduced an in silico agent-based model that describes the complex collective motion pattern observed in the corneal epithelium as an emergent phenomenon. The model only requires simple assumptions about local cell behaviours and neither relies on any organ-scale pre-patterning or regulation nor requires the imposition of any external guidance cues or any shear and tensile strains that may otherwise cause the sliding of epithelial cells in logarithmic vortices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Mohammad Nejad et al., 2015</xref>). In vivo, cell migration patterns can, therefore, be quantitatively explained by a simple agent-based model commonly studied in the physics of soft active matter systems. This is the first corneal model to successfully reproduce the central vortex motion of epithelial cells around the corneal centre in simulations. The key outcomes from this study are that to recapitulate experimentally observed patterns of cell migration in vivo, cells need to: 1) be able to actively migrate, 2) respond to mechanical pressure due to the population of other cells, 3) align their migration direction to that of their neighbours (i.e. ‘go with the flow’), 4) have density-dependent control of proliferation, and 5) maintain a high rate of limbal cell proliferation. Then the emerging pattern is robust to noise, i.e. stochastic components in cell motion and proliferation. Furthermore, we were able to determine model parameters from experiments, which allowed for quantitative comparison between the in silico model and the biological system. Changing model parameters results in markedly different cell migration patterns that may apply to other biological scenarios, underscoring the power of the agent-based active matter models in describing collective cell behaviours.</p>
<p>Notably, in the cornea, where motile cells are bounded by immobile stem cells, the model predicts that at no time do cells need guidance cues to direct them towards the corneal centre. Given the step into the cornea from the limbus, which we impose on the simulations and reflects the likely durotactic pressure on cells moving from the soft limbal stroma to the stiffer corneal stroma, the radial centripetal migration that has long fascinated biologists can then be explained as being generated by a biophysical model.</p>
<p>The high parameter of limbal cell division that is required to produce robust radial striping is superficially at variance with the paradigm that suggests limbal epithelial stem cells to be slow-cycling. However, within the inner limbus, cycling stem cells give rise to rapidly dividing TA cells. Although up to 25% of limbal cells may be slow cycling, we previously calculated that the mean limbal epithelial cell cycle time is lower than that observed in the corneal epithelium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Sagga et al., 2018</xref>). There is, therefore, no discrepancy between the stem cell parameters imposed on our model and the real biological situation.</p>
<p>Analysis of the agent-based simulations data shows that at the start of the simulations, the sheet is peppered with ±1 topological defects, but those collide with each other and cancel out until a single +1 defect persists. Across several simulations, the model also found multiple +1 and -1 defects during the first 5 days, but by about simulated day 10 invariably only one defect remained. During simulations, each topological defect moved stochastically, which enabled all but one +1 defect to collide and eventually cancel out. This ‘Highlander’ model, where only one defect can survive, is a direct result of simulations but also has strong relevance to our understanding of biology. The start of the simulations represents the young mouse corneal epithelium which consists of a random unoriented patchwork of ‘blue’ and ‘white’ cells, full of topological defects, with the development of the single central vortical swirl only manifesting after days or weeks of radial cell migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Collinson et al., 2002</xref>). The simulation suggested that it may be possible that two or more +1 discontinuities survive long-term (providing the overall topology of the cornea remains +1) if one or more -1 and +1 discontinuities happen not to collide. An in vivo example of this is seen in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>.</p>

<title>Outlook: Models of the cornea and active matter</title>
<p>The physics of active matter has emerged as a powerful tool to describe many collective processes in biological systems, revealing that many complex biological processes rely on common physical mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Alert and Trepat, 2020</xref>). The cornea studied here is one such example. What, however, sets it apart from most other active matter studies of collective cell migration is the presence of curvature. Curvature alters the common notions of straight and parallel lines, which affects how active agents interact with each other if confined to move on a curved surface. It can also lead to the appearance of topological defects (e.g. the +1 defect at the cornea top), which can have important implications for the development of the organism, e.g. as was recently argued to be the case for hydra (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Maroudas-Sacks et al., 2021</xref>). Compared to the efforts put into understanding active behaviour in flat spaces, the current understanding of the interplay of curvature and activity is, however, very limited. We, therefore, hope that this work will motivate further research in this direction.</p>
<p>Previously, coordinate-based in silico models of ocular striping have attempted to model the cornea, but did not adequately recapitulate the biological state, due to not accounting for the correct geometry and curvature of the cornea (70° hemisphere) and often ignoring factors such as cell migration. In one study, the cornea was modelled on a flat surface with population pressure from neighbouring cells being solely responsible for mobility, with cells moving from higher to lower pressure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Lobo et al., 2016</xref>). In contrast, another study used a simple stochastic approach with a hemisphere geometry, in which patterning is driven by proliferation, ignoring migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Moraki et al., 2019</xref>). Both studies explored the effects of manipulating the amount of cell loss in different regions from the surface of the cornea through higher terminal differentiation of the TA cells (e.g. mimicking UVR damage), employed lineage tracking and the ability of all the cell types to undergo asymmetric or symmetric divisions. However, neither model incorporated all the components of cell-cell interaction, persistence, correlation and noise, and neither was able to generate a spiral migration pattern, a key feature observed in vivo.</p>

<sec id="s3c">
<title>Outlook: The cornea and cell migration</title>
<p>An important feature of our model is its stability over scale and corneal shape, reflecting the fact that patterns of radial migration have been observed in multiple species, including humans, with very different corneal shapes and sizes. It also allows us to directly test hypotheses for corneal homeostasis and make predictions about the corneal response to genetic, pharmacological and physical manipulation.</p>
<p>Eye opening in mice, at around 10 days postnatally, predates the emergence of radial striping patterns in vivo. The increase in corneal abrasion and cell loss concomitant with eye opening is presumably the trigger for limbal stem cell activation, though this has never been experimentally demonstrated, and the radial orientation of cell movement and neuronal projection is observed relatively rapidly following eye opening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Iannaccone et al., 2012</xref>). We suggest that the increase in cell loss associated with eye opening is a wound mimic which drives the rapid initiation of radial stripe patterns in young mice, and this is supported by the in silico modelling. By changing the parameters of simulated cell behaviour, it will be possible to mimic the effect of mutations in genes controlling cell velocity (e.g. Pax6) and polar alignment (e.g. Vangl2), both of which have been shown to disrupt patterns of corneal epithelial migration in vivo.</p>
<p>Understanding corneal epithelial cell homeostasis is essential to improve wound healing after corrective eye surgery, and to develop treatments for corneal diseases. The cornea is a paradigm system of epithelial maintenance by a population of stem cells. It is a system of choice for interdisciplinary studies of the biomechanics of cell migration because it is simple (few cell types), transparent (thus accessible to in vivo imaging), nonessential for life (thus amenable for mutation), and accessible to modelling. However, the principles and mechanisms of the cell migratory response are likely to be similar to those that underlie cell migration patterns in other tissues that are morphologically or functionally less amenable to investigation. The findings here, that a dense active matter model can recapitulate and predict patterns of epithelial cell behaviour in vivo, likely have general relevance to multiple cell migration events throughout embryogenesis and wound healing. The morphogenetic movements and epithelial-mesenchymal interactions that produce swirls of hair follicles on the head or that underlie patterns of pigmentation commonly associated with ‘Blaschko’s lines’, may also be predicted by an active matter model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Plikus and Chuong, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Kücken and Newell, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Tenea, 2017</xref>).</p>

<title>Estimating velocity fields from stripes</title>
<p>The mouse cornea is not a full hemisphere so we measured the spherical cap angle and eye diameter experimentally in nine adult corneas giving an average of 71.1° ± 0.3° SEM cap angle, and 3.60 ± 0.02 mm SEM in diameter, rounded to 70° and 3.6 mm, respectively for modelling.</p>
<p>In vivo, we inferred three-dimensional corneal epithelial flow patterns by the proxy of tracing the boundaries between LacZ-positive and negative radial stripes in XLacZ mosaic corneas. As shown in the in silico model, despite some small-scale mixing at the boundaries, the steady-state flow field is parallel to the stripe boundaries. We proceeded as follows to extract approximate flow patterns from XLacZ corneal epithelia: first, we captured scaled images of each eye (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9a</xref>). After photography, we dissected the cornea from each eye, made 8 radial partial cuts then flat-mounted the cornea for high-resolution images (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9b</xref>). Using Inkscape image processing software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Inkscape Project, 2020</xref>), we drew a circle corresponding to the limbus on the image in a first colour, together with the edges of the radial cuts in a second colour, generating a background image file. In a second layer, we drew the edges of the stripes. Because different clonal stripes were often in different shades of blue, it was usually also possible to resolve clonal borders within blue stripes, with as much detail and covering as possible (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9c</xref>). Different colours were used to distinguish separate flow lines, and we saved this layer as a separate image file.</p>
<p>These digitised corneas were used to extract the flow fields using a custom MATLAB code: We first read the background image file and extracted the limbal circle as well as the edges of the cuts. We then placed equally spaced points in 40 concentric rings in only the interior of the irregular polygon of the actual cornea defined by this method (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9d</xref>). On each ring of radius <italic>r</italic>, we defined <italic>n</italic> individual points with spacing <italic>dr</italic> = 2<italic>πr</italic>/<italic>n</italic> with coordinates <bold>r</bold><sub><italic>k</italic></sub> = (<italic>r</italic> cos <italic>α</italic><sub><italic>k</italic></sub>, <italic>r</italic> sin <italic>α</italic><sub><italic>k</italic></sub>), where <italic>α</italic><sub><italic>k</italic></sub> = 2<italic>πk</italic>/<italic>n</italic>; here the <italic>k</italic> corresponding to coordinates inside the cut areas were removed. The remaining points were where we then aimed to define the flow field.</p>
<p>We then read the image file containing flow lines and extracted the pixels corresponding to drawn lines, mapping each colour to a different label. We fitted directional unit vectors to pieces of lines using linear regression on groups of pixels from the same line. Here we chose the direction of the arrow so that arrows at the limbus pointed inward, and so that subsequent arrows on the same line were in the same direction. We applied an error correction step so that velocity vectors of adjacent ring points were required to point in the same direction, flipping individual directors if necessary. Finally, we averaged orientations over the different arrows within <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="608002v1_inline8.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> distance of a point to define the velocity unit vector on ring points. These inferred velocity vectors are shown as red arrows in <xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9</xref>.</p>
<p>Since the cornea corresponds to a spherical cap with a 70° angle, we needed to close the gaps left by the radial cuts. To achieve this, we applied a virtual moulding technique to the image points starting from the inside and moving down ring by ring (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9e</xref>): To move the tissue on either side of the cuts together, we introduced springs between all neighbouring pairs of points, and also between points between the ring and the previous (interior) one if they were within distance <italic>dr</italic>. We defined an energy function for our network of springs,
<disp-formula id="eqn6">
<graphic xlink:href="608002v1_eqn6.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula>
</p>
<p>Using a Monte Carlo simulation with effective temperature <italic>kT</italic> = 0.01, we then sequentially equilibrated each ring for 1000 Monte Carlo sweeps, starting from the centre. The final angles were then equally spaced, closing the cuts. The final arrangements of points on the now curved cornea are shown in <xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9f</xref>. We then inferred the flow direction in the region between stripe edges: Since neighbouring flow fields (or ‘spins’) are expected to be similar to each other, we introduce an aligning energy term akin to modelling magnets, i.e. the XY model, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="608002v1_inline9.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>, where the sum is over neighbouring points only (black lines in <xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9g</xref>). In spherical coordinates, (<italic>ê</italic><sub><italic>r</italic></sub>, <italic>ê</italic><sub><italic>θ</italic></sub>, <italic>ê</italic><sub><italic>ϕ</italic></sub>) as shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2c</xref>, we could define the orientation of the flow direction <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="608002v1_inline10.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> through the deviation angle <italic>α</italic> from inward flow, i.e. <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="608002v1_inline11.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> in the local tangent plane to the sphere. One could then show using parallel transport (to first order), that the dot product corresponds to <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="608002v1_inline12.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>. Here <italic>α</italic><sub><italic>j</italic></sub> was shifted by the difference in longitude <italic>ϕ</italic><sub><italic>j</italic></sub> − <italic>ϕ</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> between the two points, which is significant for direct neighbours close to the pole. We then again used a Monte Carlo approach with simulated annealing where we gradually reduced the effective temperature in steps from <italic>kT</italic> = 1 to <italic>kT</italic> = 0.001 to minimise the energy of our spin configuration while keeping the red arrows where we already knew the flow direction was fixed. As the directions are parameterised by declination <italic>α</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>, all arrows remain tangent to the sphere, ensuring that our flow field is on the corneal surface, not into it or out from it. The resulting estimated flow field is shown in <xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9h</xref>, and in main <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2a</xref>.</p>

<title>Defect finding algorithm and spherical coordinates</title>
<p>In order to identify the locations of topological defects in the flow field, we first constructed a Delaunay triangulation.

Similarly, <italic>N</italic><sub>a</sub> = Δ<italic>t</italic> ∫<sub><italic>S</italic></sub> <italic>a</italic>(<italic>ρ</italic>)<italic>ρ</italic>(<bold>r</bold>, <italic>t</italic>)d<bold>r</bold>, where <italic>a</italic>(<italic>ρ</italic>) is the density-dependent extrusion rate. The flux of cells through the border of the patch can be expressed through a number flux current <bold>J</bold> = <italic>ρ</italic><bold>v</bold>, i.e. the number of particles with velocity <bold>v</bold> passing through a unit line in unit time, with units of inverse time and length,
<disp-formula id="ueqn1">

where the integral is over the boundary of <italic>S</italic> and <bold>n</bold> is an outward pointing unit-length normal. Putting all of the pieces together, one obtains

<title>Cornea spiral flux equations</title>
<p>We now explore the implications of the continuity equation for an existing spiral flux on the corneal surface. Consider a cornea that is on the surface of a sphere with radius <italic>R</italic>, with an opening angle at the limbus of <italic>θ</italic><sub>L</sub> = 70°. Using spherical coordinates as in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2c</xref>, with <italic>θ</italic> as the angle from the cornea centre and <italic>ϕ</italic> the azimuthal angle, we assume that we have an established symmetric spiral flux ending at the cornea centre, making an angle <italic>α</italic>(<italic>θ</italic>) with the radially inward direction. We assume that the density is symmetric, i.e. that we have <italic>ρ</italic>(<italic>θ</italic>), and that the average cell velocity in the local polar coordinate system is given by <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="608002v1_inline29.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>. We also recall that in spherical coordinates, the divergence of vector <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="608002v1_inline30.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> is given by
<disp-formula id="ueqn3">
<graphic xlink:href="608002v1_ueqn3.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula>
</p>
<p>Here, we have <bold>U</bold> = <italic>ρ</italic><bold>v</bold>, and we are always on the corneal surface with <italic>r</italic> = <italic>R</italic><sub><italic>c</italic></sub> and we eventually write
<disp-formula id="ueqn4">
<graphic xlink:href="608002v1_ueqn4.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula>
</p>
<p>In steady-state, i.e. when the system becomes time-independent so that <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="608002v1_inline31.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>, eqn. (13) reduces to ∇ ⋅ (<italic>ρ</italic><bold>v</bold>) − <italic>A</italic>(<italic>ρ</italic>)<italic>ρ</italic> = 0, where the effective net loss rate <italic>A</italic>(<italic>ρ</italic>) = − [<italic>d</italic>(<italic>ρ</italic>) − <italic>a</italic>(<italic>ρ</italic>)]. We then find a time-independent, ordinary differential equation in the variable <italic>θ</italic> linking velocity, density and spiral angle:
<disp-formula id="eqn14">
<graphic xlink:href="608002v1_eqn14.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula>
</p>
<p>We can make one more simplifying assumption, namely that <italic>ρ</italic> is approximately constant in the system. This is reasonable, first observationally as shown in <xref rid="fig11" ref-type="fig">Figure 11</xref>, and second, because the relaxation time of the potential is much much faster than the typical migration time. We will however retain two effects on the net loss rate <italic>A</italic>: First, <italic>A</italic>(<italic>ρ</italic>) is very sensitive to density, so we can not fully neglect its effect. Second, in our system TA cells have a typical lifetime, suppressing their death rate near the emergence from the limbus. We will therefore retain an angle dependence <italic>A</italic> = <italic>A</italic>(<italic>θ</italic>). Then the final continuity (XYZ) equation is given by
<disp-formula id="eqn15">
<graphic xlink:href="608002v1_eqn15.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula></p>
<fig id="fig11" position="float" fig-type="figure">

<p>Note that for <italic>J</italic> above the alignment transition and all <italic>R</italic> the apparent regions of lower <italic>ϕ</italic> at <italic>θ</italic> &gt; 50° are due to corneas with asymmetric defect patterns clipping the edge of the cornea at those angles away from the defect.</p></caption>
<graphic xlink:href="608002v1_fig11.tif" mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image"/>
</fig>
<p><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figures 6</xref> and <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref> show the numerically observed spiral angle <italic>α</italic>(<italic>θ</italic>), velocity magnitude <italic>v</italic>(<italic>θ</italic>) and the effective death rate <italic>A</italic>(<italic>θ</italic>). It becomes immediately clear that none of these functions is simple, and that there is a strong dependence on the radius of the simulated cornea, despite <italic>R</italic> only appearing in the scaling of the net death rate <italic>A</italic> in eqn. (15). A major contribution to the complexity is the form of <italic>A</italic>(<italic>θ</italic>): As can be seen, it is negative near the limbus where cells are recent descendants of stem cells, and then positive and approximately constant towards the inner regions of the cornea. Nevertheless, eqn. (15) is satisfied: the centrally inward (along <italic>ê</italic><sup><italic>θ</italic></sup>) part of the velocity is given by <italic>F</italic> (<italic>θ</italic>) = <italic>v</italic>(<italic>θ</italic>) cos(<italic>α</italic>(<italic>θ</italic>)), representing the inward flux of material. Undoing a number of the spherical coordinate derivatives, we can rewrite <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn15">equation 15</xref> as a function of the inward flux:
<disp-formula id="eqn16">
<graphic xlink:href="608002v1_eqn16.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula>
</p>
<p>We supplement this equation with the following boundary conditions. First of all, the flux needs to vanish at the central defect, i.e. at <italic>θ</italic> = 0, <italic>F</italic> (0) = 0. This means that either <italic>v</italic>(0) = 0, i.e. the cells completely stop moving anywhere on average at the centre, or cos(<italic>α</italic>(0)) = 0, which means that the velocity is at an angle <italic>α</italic>(0) = ±90°, or completely orthogonal to the inward direction. We can then in fact find an integral solution for <italic>F</italic> (<italic>θ</italic>): First make the change of variables <italic>u</italic>(<italic>θ</italic>) = <italic>F</italic> (<italic>θ</italic>) sin <italic>θ</italic>, which when replaced in eqn. (16) leads us to
<disp-formula id="ueqn5">
<graphic xlink:href="608002v1_ueqn5.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula>
using the boundary condition <italic>u</italic>(0) = <italic>F</italic> (0) sin(0) = 0. Then we arrive at our final prediction for the flux on the cornea for a given death profile <italic>A</italic>(<italic>θ</italic>):

<body>
<p>This <bold>useful</bold> study describes a physical mechanism for the emergence of spiral patterns in the outer epithelial layer of the mammalian cornea independent of pre-patterning or guidance cues, using an agent-based model of self-propelled particles with alignment. The model is well constructed, however the central premise of the manuscript, that the spiral patterning of epithelial corneal cells occurs without guidance cues, is <bold>incomplete</bold> and not fully supported. Several significant questions remain unanswered, such as the role of the corneal curvature or the importance of topological defects. Furthermore, comparison between the model and data are qualitative at best for the moment.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The manuscript by Kostanjevec et al. investigates the mechanism behind spiral pattern formation in the cornea. The authors demonstrate that the spiral motion pattern on the mammalian corneal surface emerges from the interaction between the limbus position, cell division, extrusion, and collective cell migration. Using LacZ mosaic murine corneas, they reveal a tightening spiral flow pattern and show that their cell-based, in silico model accurately reproduces these patterns without global guidance cues. Additionally, they present a continuum model that extends the XYZ hypothesis to describe cell flux on the cornea, offering a quantitative explanation for tissue-scale processes on curved surfaces.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The manuscript is well-written, with a systematic approach that clearly explains experimental setups, model construction, assumptions, parameter selection, and predictions. The discussion also provides insightful perspectives on the broader implications of the results for both physics and biology.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The central premise of the manuscript, that the spiral patterning of epithelial corneal cells occurs without guidance cues, is not fully supported. The authors overlook the potential role of axons in guiding epithelial cells, despite clear evidence of spiral axon patterns in their own Fig. 1b. Previous literature indicates that axon patterning precedes epithelial cell patterning, suggesting that epithelial migration might be influenced by pre-existing neural structures (e.g., Leiper et al. 2002, IOVS 2013). The authors need to address this point, possibly by exploring whether axonal patterns serve as a template for epithelial cell migration, or by providing experimental evidence to rule out axon-based guidance.</p>
<p>While the model is well-constructed, it currently falls short of its stated goal of elucidating the mechanisms of spiral formation. Key questions remain unanswered:</p>
<p>
Is the curvature of the cornea necessary for spiral formation, or would a simpler disk geometry suffice?</p>
<p>
What role do boundary conditions play?</p>
<p>
How well do the model's predictions quantitatively match experimental data?</p>
<p>
The current comparisons in Fig. 4c-f lack quantitative agreement, and this discrepancy should be discussed with possible explanations.</p>
<p>The authors emphasize polar alignment as a key feature of the spiral pattern based on simulation results. However, they do not provide experimental evidence for this polar alignment. The manuscript includes discussions of polar and nematic symmetries that, without supporting data, feel somewhat distracting. If direct experimental evidence for polar alignment is not available, the authors could instead quantify nematic alignment as the spiral forms. This would also allow them to explore potential crosstalk between nematic cell orientation and the polar alignment of self-propulsion, especially considering recent studies showing alternative mechanisms for vortex formation in similar systems.</p>

<p>In K. Kostanjevec et.al, the authors study a possible mechanism for the formation of spiral patterns in the cornea. First the authors analyze an inferred velocity field, which is deduced from images of fixed corneas, and then determine the position-dependent spiral angle of this velocity fields. Next, the authors analysed two possible markers of cell polarity: the direction of the centrosome-nuclei and the axis of mitosis. Then the authors introduce a stochastic agent-based model of self-propelled particles with over-damped dynamics and with aligning interactions to the orientation of the nearest neighbors and to the particle's velocity. The authors claim to be able to reproduce the equal-time autocorrelation function and the velocity Fourier spectrum. Then the authors introduce the geometry of the cornea by constraining the dynamics on a spherical cap and show that their model can reproduce a typical trajectory in experiments. Finally, the authors produce a phase diagram of the states at a fixed time point as a function of the spherical cap radius and the strength of the coupling aligning constant. Finally, the authors propose an interpretation of the cell fluxes based on the equation of mass conservation.</p>

<p>We thank the referees for finding our work well written and systematic. We are planning a revision of the manuscript based on the public review and the confidential recommendations of the referees.</p>
<p>The role of axons:</p>
<p>Indeed, radial axon projections appear before mature epithelial stripes in the cornea (Iannaccone et al., 2012). Our claim is, however, not that guidance cues are absent, but that global cues are unnecessary. The alignment term in our model, together with evidence that corneal epithelial cells follow contact-mediated substrate cues (Walczysko et al., 2016), show that corneal cells migration is responsive to external forces, and the underlying patterns of axonal projections could be one of those cues.</p>
<p>Experiments (Collinson et al., 2002) and simulations in this work show that a rapid spiral epithelial flow forms first, with cells migrating radially for ~2 weeks before stripes become visible. Axons seeking the path of least resistance within this moving basal layer would therefore appear radial early on. By contrast, establishing visible stripes requires an entire cohort of epithelial cells to travel from the limbus to the central cornea (Fig. 7). Extensive in-vivo studies (Song et al., 2004; Leiper et al., 2009) find no evidence that axons direct epithelial migration; if anything, epithelial flow dictates axonal trajectories.</p>
<p>Geometry and boundaries:</p>
<p>The spiral also forms on a flat disc, but its exact shape changes with curvature and cap angle; this variation is seen across mammals, including humans (Dua et al., 1993) and in diseases such as keratoconus. On a spherical cap the boundary winding number fixes the interior index, so ongoing limbal influx keeps the total index = 1.</p>
<p>In the revised version, we will therefore simulate a range of curvatures, cap angles, a prolate ellipsoid, and cases without limbal division, then compare with published data and disease states.</p>
<p>In-vitro data and parameter fits:</p>
<p>Although our dataset is limited, the inferred parameters match three independent invitro estimates (Kostanjevec et al. 2020; Saraswathibhatla et al. 2021; Kammeraat et al. in prep.). Spatial correlations exceed those expected from persistence alone, implying some polar alignment - consistent with Saraswathibhatla et al. 2021.  Slide-scanner images that we will include in the revision show cells are neither elongated nor nematically ordered. In the revision we will detail our parameter extraction, highlight evidence for alignment, stress the substrate-based activity mechanism, and draw attention to the supplementary videos.</p>
<p>Topological clarification:</p>
<p>Stagnation points can be seen as topological defects because classification depends only on vector directions. Boundary conditions can remove such defects in fluids, yet two sources/sinks still interact via the same logarithmic Green’s function that governs disclinations, despite di^erent physics. The Euler characteristic is a property of the surface; while the boundary winding number fixes the field index, it does not alter the surface’s Euler characteristic.</p>
<p>In the revision, we will add a concise primer on the di^erential-geometric concepts to make these points explicit.</p>
