<title>Abstract</title>
<p>This study investigates the variability among patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in their responses to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI). Recognizing that patients with advanced-stage NSCLC rarely qualify for surgical interventions, it becomes crucial to identify biomarkers that influence responses to ICI therapy. We conducted an analysis of single-cell transcriptomes from 33 lung cancer biopsy samples, with a particular focus on 14 core samples taken before the initiation of palliative ICI treatment. Our objective was to link tumor and immune cell profiles with patient responses to ICI. We discovered that ICI non-responders exhibited a higher presence of CD4+ regulatory T cells, resident memory T cells, and TH17 cells. This contrasts with the diverse activated CD8+ T cells found in responders. Furthermore, tumor cells in non-responders frequently showed heightened transcriptional activity in the NF-kB and STAT3 pathways, suggesting a potential inherent resistance to ICI therapy. Through the integration of immune cell profiles and tumor molecular signatures, we achieved an accuracy rate exceeding 95% in predicting patient responses to ICI treatment. These results underscore the crucial importance of the interplay between tumor and immune microenvironment, including within metastatic sites, in affecting the effectiveness of ICIs in NSCLC.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Treatment landscape in cancer has rapidly evolved with the introduction of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI). Among various immune checkpoints, antibody-targeting programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) and its ligand (PD-L1) have demonstrated clinical benefits over conventional systemic chemotherapy in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). They have been approved as either monotherapy in patients with high PD-L1 expression <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup> or combined with cytotoxic chemotherapy regardless of PD-L1 expression <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. Moreover, the clinical benefits were validated in unresectable stage III NSCLC as consolidation therapy after definitive chemoradiotherapy or early stage NSCLC (Ib-IIIA) as adjuvant therapy after curative surgery <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>There have been many efforts to elucidate the predictive biomarkers of PD-(L)1 inhibitors. The PD-L1 expression in tumor tissue evaluated via immunohistochemistry has been incorporated as a companion diagnostic biomarker from the early clinical trials, which enhanced the response rate up to 46% in patients with PD-L1 â¥50% and showed an overall survival rate of up to 26.3 months <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. Other biomarkers, such as tumor mutation burden or gene expression profile, also demonstrated a positive predictive value <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. Recent large-scale meta-analysis of clinico-immunogenomics shows that both tumor- and T cell intrinsic factors exert a substantial impact on ICI response <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>, supporting the necessity of in-depth investigation of high-throughput profiles of tumor and microenvironment.</p>
<p>ICI treatment modifies systemic immune profiles represented by changing the proportion of specific cell types. The increase in PD-1+Ki67+CD8+ T cells in the peripheral blood after treatment with PD-1 inhibitors is associated with a better outcome in patients with NSCLC <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>. The cell type has also been identified in tumor tissues and related to clinical outcomes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Tumor-infiltrating PD-1 positive T cells have higher capacity of tumor recognition than PD-1 negative T cells, indicating certain types of T cells in tumor bed function as tumor-specific T cells. In addition to T cells, other immune cell types, such as myeloid-derived suppressor cells or regulatory T cells, regulating the tumor-specific T cell immunity may also influence the therapeutic outcome <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>. In summary, the multicellular regulation of the tumor-immune microenvironment highlights the importance of systemic tumor and immune cell profiling at single cell resolution to investigate baselines associated with response to ICI treatment.</p>

<title>Variability and features of the lung cancer samples</title>
<p>We conducted scRNA-seq on 33 lung cancer samples from 26 patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) between August 2017 and December 2019 to understand how cellular dynamics in lung cancer affect treatment sensitivity to PD-(L)1 inhibitors, used alone or in combination (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref> and Table S1). Immune checkpoint therapy provides clinical benefit in advanced metastatic NSCLC across different treatment lines <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. Notably, our samples have been collected from various tissue sites. In the scRNA-seq analysis, all specimens were used for the cell type profiling in an unbiased manner. For the evaluation of clinical outcomes, refined 14 core samples from 11 patients were used to minimize sample specific variations. Exclusion criteria from the core group encompass samples with treatment applied as adjuvant therapy, acquired after ICI treatment, no tumor content, non-evaluable for the clinical response, or histology other than non-small cell lung cancer (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>). Of the 11 core patients, 8 had adenocarcinoma and 3 had squamous cell carcinoma. Clinical outcomes of ICI were partial response (PR) in four patients, stable disease (SD) in two patients, and progressive disease (PD) in five patients. Patients were classified as responders (PR) and non-responders (SD and PD) according to ICI response.</p>

<p>Due to the diversity of sample collection sites, our data may be influenced by varied immune cell composition at different sample collection sites. Therefore, we analyzed immune and stromal cell subsets across early-stage (tLung) and late-stage (tL/B) lung tumors, and metastatic lymph nodes (mLN), comparing them to normal lung (nLung) and lymph node (nLN) tissues. This analysis was conducted on public scRNA-seq data from 43 samples from 33 LUAD patients <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup> (Fig. S1a-c). Although there were differences in tissue-specific resident populations, we found that the immune cell profiles, especially T/NK cells of mLN were similar to those of primary tumor tissues indicating the activation of immune responses were consistently observed at metastatic sites (Fig. S1d-f).</p>

<title>Classification of immune cell subset in lung cancer</title>
<p>Global cell-type profiling (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b,c</xref> and Table S2) illustrates the cellular composition of each sample as epithelial/tumor cells, fibroblasts, endothelial cells, T/natural killer (NK) cells, B/plasma cells, myeloid immune cells, and mast cells. Individual samples show variations in epithelial/tumor content as well as in immune cell composition (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d,e</xref>).</p>
<p>For further analysis of immune cell subtypes, we applied sequential subclustering on global immune cell clusters. As scRNA-seq shows limited performance in separating CD4+ and CD8+ T cell subsets, antibody-derived tag (ADT) information <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup> was used to complement the transcriptome data and to predict CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, and NK cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>). Finally, fourteen CD4+ and fourteen CD8+ T cell subclusters were identified excluding &lt;5% ambiguous cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b,c</xref> and Table S2). In the CD4+ T cell compartment, naÃ¯ve-like T cells (TN, CD4_cluster0) and central memory T cells (TCM, CD4_cluster1) expressing <italic>SELL, TCF7, LEF1,</italic> and <italic>CCR7</italic> genes or tissue-resident memory T cells (TRM, CD4_clusters3, 5, 6) expressing <italic>NR4A1, MYADM,</italic> and <italic>PTGER4</italic> genes were abundant in most samples. Regulatory T cells (Treg, CD4_cluster2) with <italic>FOXP3, CTLA4, ICOS,</italic> and <italic>BATF</italic> expression were also abundant, which has been demonstrated as tumor-specific alterations in the tissue microenvironment <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. In the CD8+ T cell compartment, effector memory T cells (TEM), effector T cells (TEFF), effector memory CD45RA positive cells (TEMRA) (CD8_clusters0, 2, 3, 8) expressing <italic>PRF1</italic> and <italic>IFNG</italic> were dominant over TN/TCM (CD8_clusters4, 5) types. Exhausted T cells (TEX, CD8_clusters1, 12) expressed multiple checkpoint genes (<italic>HAVCR2</italic> and <italic>PDCD1</italic>) along with high levels of <italic>PRF1</italic>, <italic>IFNG</italic>, <italic>CXCR3,</italic> and <italic>CXCL13</italic>. Co-expression of cytotoxic effectors and checkpoint molecules in TEX clusters indicates that cluster populations may retain functional capacity as cytotoxic effector T cells <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. Further, clonotype analysis of TCR supported the T cell subset classification demonstrating higher clonal expansion in the CD8+ T cell compartment than that in CD4+ T cells, with the highest levels within the TEX subclass (Fig. S2a-c).</p>

<p>Natural killer cells can be subclassified as CD56bright, transitional, active, and mature types <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup> (Fig. S3a,b and Table S2). Active NK cells expressed the highest level of <italic>PRF1</italic>, <italic>TNF,</italic> and <italic>IFNG,</italic> reflecting a cytotoxic effector function.</p>
<p>Compared to T cell clusters, fewer B/plasma cells were detected as follicular (B_clusters 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 11), germinal center (B_cluster 10), and plasma/mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) B cells (B_clusters 3, 7, 12) (Fig. S3a,b and Table S2). Plasma/MALT B cells manifested higher levels of clonal expansion of BCR than follicular B cells (Fig. S3c,d). Identical clonality of some follicular B and plasma cells suggests in situ maturation and differentiation of B cells to plasma cells in tumor tissues (Fig. S3c, clonotype 16).</p>
<p>Myeloid cells were composed of monocytes, dendritic cells, and a large number of macrophages (Fig. S3a,b and Table S2). CD14+CD16-classical monocytes (Myeloid_clusters1,6) were predominantly found over non-classical CD14<sup>lo</sup>CD16+ types (Myeloid_cluster15).

<title>Immune cell landscape fostering the ICI response</title>
<p>In global cell-type profiling (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b,c</xref>), abundance in T, NK, or myeloid cell types shows no difference between responders and non-responders (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d, e</xref>). Nonetheless, as specific differentiation features within the cell types may influence the response to ICI treatment, we compared the response groups using the proportion of subclusters within CD4+ T, CD8+ T, NK, B/plasma, and myeloid cells. After subclustering (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref> and Fig. S3a), three subsets of CD4+ T cells, i.e., Treg, TRM, and CD4+ T helper 17 (TH17), were significantly (p&lt;0.01) overrepresented in the non-responder group (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d</xref>). In contrast, among CD8+ T cell populations, TEM subsets demonstrated a modest level of association with the patients who responded well against progressive disease (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d</xref>, p=0.06). TCR clonotype analysis supported the cellular dynamics such that clonal expansion was more prominent in cytotoxic CD8+ T cells over CD4+ Tregs in the responder group (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2e</xref> and Fig. S2c). Overall landscape in each cell type (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2f</xref>) suggests that CD4+ Treg and TRM as well as follicular B cells may interfere with the ICI response, whereas CD8+ T cell activation (TEM, TEMRA/TEFF, and TEX), mature NK cells, and CXCL10+ Mo-Mac cells support the ICI response. The balance between separate immune cell types informs immune regulatory axes that may be targeted to favor the activation of tumor-reactive immunity.</p>

<title>Systemic evaluation of the immune microenvironment associated with ICI response</title>
<p>Next, we evaluated the immune microenvironment as an entity by using all immune cells as a denominator in the subtype proportions. In this setting, we used diverse clinical group comparisons and identified the immune cell blocks separated by clinical outcomes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>). The immune cell blocks overrepresented in the non-responder groups consisted of CD4+ Treg, follicular B cells, and CD4+ TH17/TRM/ T helper 1 (TH1)-like cells. In the immune cell blocks of the responder groups, CD8+ TEM cells showed the strongest enrichment along with the other CD8+ TEX/TEMRA/TEFF/Mitochondria (MT) high cells as well as CXCL10+ Mo-Mac.

<title>Tumor cell signatures associated with ICI response</title>
<p>We investigated the associations between genomic characteristics in tumor and ICI response. The constraints of mutation analysis with 10x chromium data complicated the direct correlation between tumor mutation burden and ICI outcome. Rather, we assessed copy number alterations (CNA) indirectly, via chromosomal gene expression patterns. These analyses revealed a moderate correlation between low levels of CNA, including both gain and loss of heterozygosity, and positive responses to ICI (Fig. S4). This finding is consistent with the result from previous genetic association studies <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>To assess gene expression characteristics of tumors influencing ICI response, we separated malignant tumor cell clusters from normal epithelial cell types (Fig. S5). Subsequent DEG analysis (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref> and Table S3) identified genes in poor response groups linked to the regulation of cell death, cell motility, and cell activation (Fig. S6 and Table S4). The DEGs were refined later by combinations of various tumor signatures separating responder and non-responder groups (Table S5).</p>

<p>Next, to explore the existence of gene programs and modules influencing the ICI response, we applied factorization using non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) and scINSIGHT <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>. Among 30 factors from NMF across all malignant cells, we identified factors showing high loadings for a specific RECIST group as NMF programs p1â¼4 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b, c</xref>). There were clear distinction among RECIST groups according to the gene expression levels associated with these NMF programs (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4d</xref> and Table S5). To identify gene modules consistent across different patients, we examined RECIST-specific modules though scINSIGHT analysis <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4e</xref>). Unfortunately, we found that contributions to these gene modules varied significantly among patients. To mitigate this variability, we adjusted the RECIST-specific modules by combining genes from the original modules (Table S5). The refined gene modules showed a specific gene expression pattern for each RECIST group, similar to the NMF programs (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4f</xref>). Overall, both genes and their functional categories segregated depending on the selection techniques used (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4g, h</xref>). However, transcription factors governing the signatures derived from DEG, NMF, and scINSIGHT analyses consistently delineated between responders and non-responders (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4i</xref>). Responder-specific gene signatures showed associations with the transcription factors Regulatory Factor X Associated Ankyrin Containing Protein (RFXANK), Regulatory Factor X Associated Protein (RFXAP), and Regulatory Factor X5 (RFX5). This RFX protein complex has emerged as a positive biomarker for the immune response in diverse cancer types <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>. Non-responder-specific gene signatures were regulated by Activator Of Transcription 3 (STAT3) and Nuclear Factor Kappa B Subunit 1 (NFKB1), known to play roles in PD-L1 regulation and T cell activation in cancer <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>We also adopted principal component analysis (PCA) to isolate correlated gene signatures variably expressed in tumor cells (Fig. S7, and Table S4, S5). Among the top 10 PCs, negatively correlated genes in PC2, PC7, and PC8 distinguished the tumor cells in the poor response groups, whereas positively correlated genes in PC6 and PC9 were upregulated in the better response groups (Fig. S8a-c). Tumor cells from the PR group had low PC2.neg scores, suggesting low growth factor/type I interferon response signaling as a tumor cell-specific positive predictor of the ICI response. Conversely, high levels of growth factor/type I interferon response signaling in tumor cells may present intrinsic resistance to PD-(L)1 inhibitor alone or in combination. Type I interferon is known to drive anti-tumor effect directly or indirectly on tumor and surrounding immune cells, but also acts to counter the anti-tumor effect by inducing CD8+ T cell exhaustion and up-regulating immune-suppressive genes on tumor cells <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>We assessed whether tumor cell signatures are applicable in association with ICI response in other tumors. They had a modest influence on the response to ICI treatment of melanoma (Fig. S8d) in bulk gene expression data <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>.</p>

<p>Immune cell dynamics or tumor signature alone has a limited capacity to profile the therapeutic outcome of PD-(L)1 inhibitor alone or in combination (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5a</xref>). Similar to the immune cell blocks and tumor signatures that were over-represented in the poor response group, each of CD4+ Treg, CD4+ TH17, PC7.neg, INT.down, and UNION.down was significantly associated with ICI response in univariate regression analysis (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5b</xref>). The variation in ICI response was not affected by clinical variables of tissue origin, cancer subtype, pathological stage, and smoking status. When we performed a combined analysis of the top tumor-immune features to classify response, the estimation power was improved to over 95% (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5c</xref>). Overall, features of the non-responders, especially CD4+ Treg, B/Plasma cells, INT.down, and UNION.down, showed a higher estimate than those of responders.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>ICI alone, or in combination with chemotherapy, are considered standard first-line therapy for patients with NSCLC. NSCLC may harbor large numbers of genetic perturbations due to genotoxic environmental exposure, which likely generate high mutation burden or neoantigens <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>. The neoantigen-directed T cell response is hampered by diverse immune suppressive mechanisms exerted by tumor cells and the immune regulatory network <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>. Current ICIs targeting PD-(L)1 aim one angle of many suppressive mechanisms, and identifying the features of non-responders will reveal additional regulatory angles to improve ICI response.</p>
<p>Immune regulatory network would determine the balance between activation and suppression of tumor-directed immunity. In previous studies, prediction of the response to ICI highlighted CD8+ cytotoxic effector T cells and CD4+ Tregs <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>. The involvement of effector CD8+ T cells is consistent in most studies regardless of the cellular origin (blood or tissues) or tumor type (melanoma, lung cancer) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>. Their phenotypes slightly differ depending on the cellular resolution of the study. Our data provided the highest resolution cell types, and CD8+ TEM cells (<italic>GZMK</italic>, <italic>CXCR4</italic> expression) were overrepresented in the responders. By comparison, Tregs were underrepresented in the responder group. Previously, our group reported a contrasting result demonstrating an increase in Tregs in the posttreatment blood samples (not baseline) in the responder group <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>. This discrepancy can be explained by the differences in the measurements, sites, and timing of sampling, and the resolution of subpopulations. In mouse preclinical models, PD-L1 inhibitor treatment induces T cell expansion of all phenotypes including CD4+/CD8+ TEFF and Tregs <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>. Thus, Treg expansion captured in the posttreatment blood samples may represent overall immune activation in human patients. Alternatively, heterogeneity of Tregs and complex effects of PD-(L)1 inhibition on this cell type may contribute to variable results in response prediction.</p>
<p>In search of tumor cell signatures associated with the response to ICI, we adopted two approaches, an individual gene level comparison between the responder and non-responder group and a feature extraction approach to decompose data using the NMF and PCA. Both approaches highlighted attributes of non-responders governed by key transcription factors, which play a significant role in immune response regulation. The ability to predict ICI response based on tumor signatures was as accurate as predictions based on immune cell behavior. Integrating data from both immune and tumor cells enhanced our predictive accuracy, suggesting the presence of both interactive and distinct mechanisms of resistance.</p>
<p>Our study has limitations. Primarily, most samples were obtained from metastatic lymph nodes rather than original tumor tissues, potentially not reflecting the tumor microenvironment accurately. However, prior study <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup> and Fig. S1 have shown that the immune microenvironment within metastatic lymph nodes closely resembles that of lung tumor tissues, rather than normal lymph nodes. On a positive note, our findings indicate that the immune landscape of metastatic lymph nodes can predict ICI response. Another challenge is the small sample size and the issue of gene expression drop-out, necessitating further studies with a larger patient cohort. Despite these limitations, our study stands out by employing high-throughput scRNA-seq to both tumor cells and immune microenvironment, offering a comprehensive analysis of the multicellular factors that affect ICI response in patients with advanced NSCLC.</p>

<title>Human specimens</title>
<p>This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of Samsung Medical Center (IRB no. 2010-04-039-052). Informed written consent was obtained from all patients enrolled in the study. The study participants included 26 patients diagnosed with lung cancer (Table S1). The study population (n=26) has been treated with the investigatorâs choice either as a clinical trial (n=5) or as standard clinical practice (n=21). Regardless of the treatment selection, the specimens were prospectively collected based on the study protocol. A total of 33 samples were collected and immediately transferred on ice for tissue preparation. Metastatic lymph nodes, metastatic liver tissues, and lung/bronchus tumor tissues from patients with lung cancer were collected using endobronchial ultrasound bronchoscopy, neck lymph node ultrasound and biopsy, liver biopsy, and percutaneous transthoracic cutting needle biopsy. Tumors, normal lungs, normal lymph nodes, and normal brain tissues were obtained during resection surgery. Pleural fluid was collected from patients with malignant pleural effusion.</p>

<p>Single-cell isolation was performed differently depending on the samples.

Tissue pieces were re-mixed by gentle pipetting at 20-min intervals during incubation. (2) Tumor and normal lung tissue dissociation was performed using a tumor dissociation kit (Miltenyi Biotech, Germany) following the manufacturerâs instructions. Briefly, tissue was cut into 2â4 mm pieces and transferred to a C tube containing the enzyme mix (enzymes H, R, and A in RPMI1640 medium). The GentleMACS programs h_tumor_01, h_tumor_02, and h_tumor_02 were run with two 30-min incubations on a MACSmix tube rotator at 37Â°C. (3) Brain tissue was chopped into 2â4 mm pieces and incubated in an enzyme solution (collagenase (Gibco, Waltham, MA, USA), DNase I (Roche, Basel, Switzerland), and Dispase I (Gibco) in DMEM) at 37Â°C for 1 h. Tissue pieces were re-mixed by gentle pipetting at 15-min intervals during incubation. (4) Pleural fluids were transferred to a 50-ml tube, and the cells were spun down at 300g.</p>
<p>Each cell suspension was transferred to a new 50-ml (15-ml for biopsy samples) tube through a 70-Âµm strainer. The volume in the tube was readjusted to 50-ml (or 15-ml) with RPMI1640 medium, and spun down to remove the enzymes. The supernatant was aspirated, the cell pellet was resuspended in 4 ml of RPMI1640 medium, and dead cells were removed using Ficoll-Paque PLUS (GE Healthcare, Chicago, IL, USA) separation.</p>

<p>Two computational tools, inferCNV v1.2.1 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/broadinstitute/inferCNV">https://github.com/broadinstitute/inferCNV</ext-link>) and CopyKAT v1.0.5 R packages <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>, were used to infer genomic copy numbers from scRNA-seq. In a run with inferCNV, the UMI count matrix of each tumor sample was loaded into inferCNV <italic>CreateInfercnvObject</italic> function along with cell lineage annotations. The reference (normal) cells were selected as cells annotated with T/NK, B/Plasma, myeloid, and mast cells. We maintained the proportion of epithelial cells below 20% in each tumor sample using the expression profiles of the normal lung and lymph node tissues. Inferred CNV signals were analyzed using inferCNV <italic>run</italic> function using the parameters: cutoff=0.1, denoise=TRUE, HMM=TRUE, and HMM_type=&quot;i6&quot;. The signals were then summarized as standard deviations (s.d.) for all windows and the correlation between the CNV in each cell and the mean of the top 5% cells <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>. Cancer cells showing CNV perturbation (&gt;0.03 s.d. or &gt;0.3 CNV correlation) were classified as malignant cells, otherwise as non-malignant cells. The UMI count matrix of each tumor sample was loaded into CopyKAT <italic>copykat</italic> function along with cell lineage annotations using the following parameters: ngene.chr=3, KS.cut=0.05, and norm.cell.names. Cancer cells predicted as aneuploid cells by CopyKAT were classified as malignant cells. Finally, we identified malignant cells, which are cancer cells classified as malignant cells in either inferCNV or CopyKAT.</p>

<title>Single-cell DEGs between response groups in malignant cells</title>
<p>A total of 12,975 malignant cells were used to identify DEGs in pairwise comparisons according to responder versus non-responder, PR versus PD, and PR versus SD. Differential expression levels were calculated using Seurat <italic>FindMarkers</italic> function with the Wilcoxon Rank Sum test. Genes were selected according to the following statistical thresholds: log fold change&gt;0.25, p-value&lt;0.01, adjusted p-value (bonferroni correction)&lt;0.01, and pct&gt;0.25. We constructed DEGs with intersection (INT) and union (UNION) of up- or down-regulated genes for comparisons.</p>

<title>Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) programs of the malignant cells</title>
<p>The UMI count matrix for malignant cells was loaded into <italic>nmf</italic> function of RcppML v0.5.6 R package. A NMF model was learned with a rank of 30 using all genes. For each of the 30 NMF factors, the top-ranked 50 genes in the NMF score were defined as signatures. RECIST-enriched NMF program consisted of selected factors based on their relative sum of loadings. We aggregated and redefined gene signatures of factors included in each NMF program. The uniqueness of each NMF program for RECIST groups was evaluated as an odds ratio using <italic>fisher.test</italic> function of stats v3.6.3 R package. Annotations of NMF programs were assigned using Metascape <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup>.</p>

<title>RECIST-specific gene modules in malignant cells</title>
<p>The RECIST-specific gene modules were analyzed with a matrix factorization named scINSIGHT <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup> using log-normalized count and 2,000 highly variable genes for each sample. For each module, we selected the 100 genes with the highest coefficients. Combinations of the top 100 genes for modules specific to each RECIST group were defined as module genes. The uniqueness of each module for RECIST groups was evaluated as an odds ratio using <italic>fisher.test</italic> function of stats v3.6.3 R package. Annotations of gene modules were assigned using Metascape <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup>.</p>

<title>Principal component signatures of the malignant cells</title>
<p>The UMI count matrix for malignant cells was log-normalized and scaled by z-transform while regressing out the effects of cell-cycle variations for PCA. A total of 2,000 variably expressed genes selected using <italic>FindVariableFeatures</italic> with selection.method=âvstâ were used for PCA. PCs were calculated by Seurat <italic>RunPCA</italic> function. PC signatures were selected for 30 genes with + (pos) and â (neg) scores that highly contributed to each PC from PC1 to PC10.</p>

<title>Functional category analysis</title>
<p>Functional categories representing the enriched gene expression in comparisons for responder vs. non-responder, PR vs. PD, and PR vs. SD as well as in the PCs were identified using fgsea v1.12.0 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup> R package with parameters: minSize=10, maxSize=600, and nperm=10000. Gene sets for Gene Ontology (GO) Biological Process were collected from the MSigDB database using msigdbr v7.1.1 R package <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup>. The gene list was ranked by the log fold change for each comparison and feature loadings for each PC. Significant GO terms were selected after collapsing redundant terms using fgsea <italic>collapsePathways</italic> function with a statistical threshold for Benjamini-Hochberg adjusted p-value&lt;0.05.</p>

<title>Responder-identifying performance tests of PC signatures and combinatorial indexes</title>
<p>Classification models of responders and non-responders for PC signatures and combinatorial indexes between tumor and/or immune cells were tested by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. Relative numbers between the observed and expected cells (<italic>Ro/e</italic>) for each sample were obtained from the chi-square test <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. Area under the curve (AUC) was calculated using <italic>ROC</italic> function of Epi v2.44 R package with <italic>Ro/e</italic> scores as input. Significance was calculated by Wilcoxon Rank Sum test and confirmed by adjusting with the Benjamini-Hochberg correction.</p>

<title>Univariate regression analysis for ICI response</title>
<p>Univariate regression was performed using the <italic>lm</italic> function of stats v3.6.3 with <italic>Ro/e</italic> scores for each sample as input. We evaluated the relationship between the target variable ICI response, classified as responders and non-responders, and one predictor variable of immune cell types, tumor signatures, and clinical factors such as tissue origin, cancer subtype, pathological stage, and smoking status. The significance of predictor was calculated using <italic>Anova</italic> function of car v3.0-9 R package.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors study the variability of patient response of NSCLC patients on immune checkpoint inhibitors using single-cell RNA sequencing in a cohort of 26 patients and 33 samples (primary and metastatic sites), mainly focusing on 11 patients and 14 samples for association analyses, to understand the variability of patient response based on immune cell fractions and tumor cell expression patterns. The authors find immune cell fraction, clonal expansion differences, and tumor expression differences between responders and non-responders. Integrating immune and tumor sources of signal the authors claim to improve prediction of response markedly, albeit in a small cohort.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>- The problem of studying the tumor microenvironment, as well as the interplay between tumor and immune features is important and interesting and needed to explain the heterogeneity of patient response and be able to predict it.</p>
<p>- Extensive analysis of the scRNAseq data with respect to immune and tumor features on different axes of hypothesis relating to immune response and tumor immune evasion using state-of-the-art methods.</p>
<p>- The authors provide an interesting scRNAseq data set linked to outcomes data.</p>
<p>- Integration of TCRseq to confirm subtype of T-cell annotation and clonality analysis.</p>
<p>- Interesting analysis of cell programs/states of the (predicted) tumor cells and characterization thereof.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>- Generally, a very heterogeneous and small cohort where adjustments for confounding are hard. Additionally, there are many tests for association with outcome, where necessary multiple testing adjustments would negate signal and confirmation bias likely, so biological takeaways have to be questioned.</p>
<p>- RNAseq is heavily influenced by the tissue of origin (both cell type and expression), so the association with the outcome can be confounded. The authors try to argue that lymph node T-cell and NK content are similar, but a quantitative test on that would be helpful.</p>
<p>- The authors claim a very high &quot;accuracy&quot; performance, however, given the small cohort and lack of information on the exact evaluation it is not clear if this just amounts to overfitting the data.</p>
<p>- Especially for tumor cell program/state analysis the specificity to the setting of ICIs is not clear and could be prognostic.</p>
<p>- Due to the small cohort with a lot of variability, more external validation is needed to be convincingly reproducible, especially when talking about AUC/accuracy of a predictor.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors have utilised deep profiling methods to generate deeper insights into the features of the TME that drive responsiveness to PD-1 therapy in NSCLC.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The main strengths of this work lie in the methodology of integrating single-cell sequencing, genetic data, and TCRseq data to generate hypotheses regarding determinants of IO responsiveness.</p>
<p>Some of the findings in this study are not surprising and well precedented eg. association of Treg, STAT3, and NFkB with ICI resistance and CD8+ activation in ICI responders and thus act as an additional dataset to add weight to this prior body of evidence. Whilst the role of Th17 in PD-1 resistance has been previously reported (eg. Cancer Immunol Immunother 2023 Apr;72(4):1047-1058, Cancer Immunol Immunother 2024 Feb 13;73(3):47, Nat Commun. 2021; 12: 2606 ) these studies have used non-clinical models or peripheral blood readouts. Here the authors have supplemented current knowledge by characterization of the TME of the tumor itself.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the study is hampered by the small sample size and heterogeneous population and whilst the authors have attempted to bring in an additional dataset to demonstrate the robustness of their approach, the small sample size has limited their ability to draw statistically supported conclusions. There is also limited validation of signatures/methods in independent cohorts, no functional characterisation of the findings, and the discussion section does not include discussion around the relevance/interpretation of key findings that were highlighted in the abstract (eg. role of Th17, TRM, STAT3, and NFKb). Because of these factors, this work (as it stands) does have value to the field but will likely have a relatively low overall impact.</p>
<p>Related to the absence of discussion around prior TRM findings, the association between TRM involvement in response to IO therapy in this manuscript is counter to what has been previously demonstrated (Cell Rep Med. 2020;1(7):100127, Nat Immunol. 2017;18(8):940-950., J Immunol. 2015;194(7):3475-3486.). However, it should be noted that the authors in this manuscript chose to employ alternative markers of TRM characterisation when defining their clusters and this could indicate a potential rationale for differences in these findings. TRM population is generally characterised through the inclusion of the classical TRM markers CD69 (tissue retention marker) and CD103 (TCR experienced integrin that supports epithelial adhesion), which are both absent from the TRM definition in this study. Additional markers often used are CD44, CXCR6, and CD49a, of which only CXCR6 has been included by the authors. Conversely, the majority of markers used by the authors in the cell type clustering are not specific to TRM (eg. CD6, which is included in the TRM cluster but is expressed at its lowest in cluster 3 which the authors have highlighted as the CD8+ TRM population). Therefore, whilst there is an interesting finding of this particular cell cluster being associated with resistance to ICI, its annotation as a TRM cluster should be interpreted with caution.</p>

These include a more cautious interpretation of our results, an expanded discussion on key findings, additional analyses for TRM characterization, and a clearer outline of future validation efforts. We believe these changes will enhance the clarity and robustness of our study, and we hope they meet the reviewerâs expectations.</p>

<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) Heterogeneous and small cohort:</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Increasing the cohort size is not feasible due to resource constraints. We acknowledge the challenges posed by the heterogeneous and small cohort, which complicate adjustments for confounding. We will apply multiple testing corrections to transparently assess and accurately report the robustness of our findings in the revision.</p>

<p>(2) Influence of tissue of origin on RNAseq:</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree that RNAseq results can be heavily influenced by the tissue of origin. While immune cell composition in the normal lung tissues and lymph nodes is quite different, we found that in tumor tissues and metastatic lymph nodes, these differences diminish and common features dominate. Although we depicted this data in the supplementary figure 1, we did not provide a quantitative test in the original submission. In the revision, we will perform additional quantitative tests to compare immune cell composition across different tissue origins. These tests will provide a more precise understanding of the cellular composition and support our argument regarding the similarity of tumor-sculpted microenvironment. We will include these results and detailed methodologies in the revision.</p>

<p>(3) Accuracy performance and overfitting:</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We acknowledge the concern regarding the high âaccuracyâ performance potentially indicating overfitting. We will clarify the evaluation methods used and moderate our claims regarding accuracy in the revision.</p>

<p>(4) Specificity of the tumor cell program/state analysis to the setting of ICIs:</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The comment suggests that the tumor programs in our study may not be specific to the ICI group but rather prognostic in lung cancer. We acknowledge this possibility as we performed comparisons between responders and non-responders (with different cut-offs) to find common trends and interpreted them in terms of their association with ICI. In the revision, we will test the prognostic association of the tumor programs using public lung cancer data.</p>

<p>(5) More external validation needed:</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We recognize the importance of external validation for reproducibility. While increasing the cohort size is not feasible, we will propose future directions for validation using larger, independent cohorts and potential experimental validations.</p>

<p>(3) Lack of functional characterization and discussion on key findings:</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the feedback regarding the need for functional characterization and a more thorough discussion of key findings on the roles of specific cell populations and genes. In the revised manuscript, we will expand the discussion section to include in-depth analysis of these findings and their relevance to the study. This includes a detailed interpretation of how these factors contribute to the immune response and potential implications for therapy.</p>

<p>(4) TRM findings and marker selection:</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We understand the concern regarding the association between TRM involvement in response to IO therapy, which appears counter to previous demonstrations. It is indeed important to note that we employed alternative markers for TRM characterization. Our choice of markers was based on transcriptional references relevant to our study. However, we agree that classical TRM markers such as CD69 and CD103, which were absent in our definition, are critical for accurate TRM identification. To address this, we will include a detailed rationale for our marker selection and acknowledge the limitations of our TRM characterization. We will include additional analyses using classical TRM markers where possible and incorporate these findings into the revision. This will provide a clearer understanding of our TRM population and its role in the immune response to IO therapy.</p>
