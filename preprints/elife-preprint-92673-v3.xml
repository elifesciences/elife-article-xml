<title>Abstract</title><p>Mutations in leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) are the most common genetic cause of Parkinson’s disease (PD), which is the leading neurodegenerative movement disorder characterized by the progressive loss of dopaminergic (DA) neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc). However, whether LRRK2 mutations cause PD and degeneration of DA neurons <italic>via</italic> a toxic gain-of-function or a loss-of-function mechanism is unresolved and has pivotal implications for LRRK2-based PD therapies. In this study, we investigate whether LRRK2 and its functional homologue LRRK1 play an essential, intrinsic role in DA neuron survival through the development of DA neuron-specific <italic>LRRK</italic> conditional double knockout (cDKO) mice. We first generated and characterized floxed <italic>LRRK1</italic> and <italic>LRRK2</italic> mice and then confirmed that germline deletions of the floxed <italic>LRRK1</italic> and <italic>LRRK2</italic> alleles result in null mutations, as evidenced by the absence of <italic>LRRK1</italic> and <italic>LRRK2</italic> mRNA and protein in the respective homozygous deleted mutant mice. We further examined the specificity of Cre-mediated recombination driven by the <italic>dopamine transporter</italic>-<italic>Cre</italic> (<italic>DAT-Cre</italic>) knockin (KI) allele using a GFP reporter line and confirmed that <italic>DAT-Cre</italic>-mediated recombination is restricted to DA neurons in the SNpc. Crossing these validated floxed <italic>LRRK1</italic> and <italic>LRRK2</italic> mice with <italic>DAT-Cre</italic> KI mice, we then generated DA neuron-restricted <italic>LRRK</italic> cDKO mice and further showed that levels of LRRK1 and LRRK2 are reduced in dissected ventral midbrains of <italic>LRRK</italic> cDKO mice. While DA neuron-restricted <italic>LRRK</italic> cDKO mice of both sexes exhibit normal mortality and body weight, they develop age-dependent loss of DA neurons in the SNpc, as demonstrated by the progressive reduction of DA neurons in the SNpc of <italic>LRRK</italic> cDKO mice at the ages of 20 and 24 months but the unaffected number of DA neurons at the age of 15 months. Moreover, DA neurodegeneration is accompanied with increases of apoptosis and elevated microgliosis in the SNpc as well as decreases of DA terminals in the striatum, and is preceded by impaired motor coordination. Taken together, these findings provide the unequivocal evidence for the importance of LRRK in DA neurons and raise the possibility that LRRK2 mutations may impair its protection of DA neurons, leading to DA neurodegeneration in PD.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Parkinson’s disease (PD) is the most common movement disorder and is characterized by the progressive loss of dopaminergic (DA) neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc). Dominantly inherited missense mutations in the <italic>leucine-rich repeat kinase 2</italic> (<italic>LRRK2</italic>) gene are the most common cause of both familial and sporadic PD, highlighting the importance of LRRK2 in PD pathogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>). LRRK2 is a large protein of 2,527 amino acid residues containing multiple functional domains including several leucine-rich repeats (LRRs), a GTPase-like domain of Ras-of-complex (Roc), a C-terminal of Roc (COR) domain, and a serine/threonine MAPKKK-like kinase domain. LRRK1, a homologue of LRRK2, belongs to the evolutionarily conserved Roco protein family and contains similar LRRs, Roc, COR, and kinase domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>). LRRK proteins are broadly expressed with LRRK2 being most abundant in the kidney (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>). While most PD mutations are found in LRRK2, rare variants in the Roc, COR, and kinase domains of LRRK1 have been reported and may be associated with PD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>). Furthermore, the Roc-COR domain of LRRK2 forms dimers and exhibits conventional Ras-like GTPase properties, and the R1441/C/G/H and I1371V mutations destabilize dimer formation and decrease GTPase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>). Recent high-resolution cryoEM structural studies of full-length LRRK2 demonstrated its existence as dimers and pathogenic mutations such as R1441/C/G/H and Y1699I at the Roc-COR interface, whereas the G2910S mutant and wild-type LRRK2 share similar structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>).</p>
<p>Previous genetic studies demonstrated that LRRK2 plays essential roles in the autophagy-lysosomal pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>). Consistent with high levels of LRRK2 expression in kidneys, <italic>LRRK2</italic>-/- mice develop age-dependent phenotypes in the kidney, including autophagy-lysosomal impairments and increases of α-synuclein, apoptosis, and inflammatory responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>). It has also been reported that LRRK2 is important for maintaining lung homeostasis, and <italic>LRRK2</italic> deficiency results in impaired autophagy in alveolar type II epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>). It was proposed that the lack of brain phenotypes in <italic>LRRK2</italic>-/- mice might be due to the presence of LRRK1 that compensates functionally in the absence of LRRK2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>). Indeed, <italic>LRRK</italic> double knockout (DKO) mice develop age-dependent, progressive loss of DA neurons in the SNpc, beginning at 14 months of age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>). However, <italic>LRRK</italic> DKO mice also exhibit lower body weight and increased mortality, raising the possibility that DA neurodegeneration in <italic>LRRK</italic> DKO mice may be secondary to poor health.</p>
<p>In this study, we investigate whether LRRK2 and its functional homologue LRRK1 play an essential, intrinsic role in DA neuron survival through the development of DA neuron-specific <italic>LRRK</italic> conditional DKO (cDKO) mice. We first generated and confirmed floxed <italic>LRRK1</italic> and <italic>LRRK2</italic> mice, and then crossed them with the <italic>CMV-Cre</italic> deleter to create germline deletions of the floxed <italic>LRRK1</italic> and <italic>LRRK2</italic> alleles, followed by Northern and Western analyses to confirm the absence of <italic>LRRK1</italic> and <italic>LRRK2</italic> mRNA and protein in the respective homozygous deleted mutant mice. We also crossed a GFP reporter mouse with <italic>DAT-Cre</italic> KI mice and confirmed that Cre-mediated recombination occurs in most, if not all, DA neurons in the SNpc and is restricted to DA neurons. We then crossed these thoroughly validated floxed <italic>LRRK1</italic> and <italic>LRRK2</italic> mice with <italic>DAT-Cre</italic> KI mice to generate DA neuron-restricted <italic>LRRK</italic> cDKO mice and further confirmed the reduction of LRRK1 and LRRK2 in dissected ventral midbrains of <italic>LRRK</italic> cDKO mice. While DA neuron-restricted <italic>LRRK</italic> cDKO mice of both sexes exhibit normal mortality and body weight, they develop age-dependent loss of DA neurons in the SNpc, as demonstrated by the progressive reduction of TH+ DA neurons or NeuN+ neurons in the SNpc of cDKO mice at the ages of 20 and 24 months. Moreover, DA neurodegeneration is accompanied with increases of apoptosis and elevated microgliosis in the SNpc as well as decreases of DA terminals in the striatum, and is preceded by impaired motor coordination. Interestingly, quantitative electron microscopy (EM) analysis showed a similar number of electron-dense vacuoles in SNpc neurons of <italic>LRRK</italic> cDKO mice relative to controls, in contrast to age-dependent increases of vacuoles in SNpc neurons of germline <italic>LRRK</italic> DKO mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>). These findings provide the unequivocal evidence for the importance of LRRK in DA neurons and raise the possibility that LRRK2 mutations may impair this crucial physiological function, leading to the loss of DA neurons in Parkinson’s disease.</p>

<title>Generation and molecular characterization of the floxed and deleted <italic>LRRK1</italic> and <italic>LRRK2</italic> alleles</title>
<p>LRRK2 and its homologue LRRK1 share several functional (LRRs, GTPase Roc, COR, and kinase) domains (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). To investigate the intrinsic role of LRRK in DA neurons, we generated floxed <italic>LRRK1</italic> (<italic>fLRRK1</italic>) and floxed <italic>LRRK2</italic> (<italic>fLRRK2</italic>) mice, which permit deletions of <italic>LRRK1</italic> and <italic>LRRK2</italic> selectively in DA neurons by <italic>DAT-Cre</italic>, in which Cre recombinase is expressed under the control of the endogenous <italic>DAT</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>). We introduced two <italic>loxP</italic> sites in introns 26 and 29 of <italic>LRRK1</italic> through homologous recombination and site-specific recombination by FLP recombinase to remove the positive selection <italic>PGK-neo</italic> cassette, which is flanked by two <italic>FRT</italic> sites (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B, C</xref>; Figure 1-figure supplement 1, 2). The embryonic stem (ES) cells carrying the targeted allele or the floxed allele were identified and validated by Southern analysis using the 5’ and 3’ external probes as well as the <italic>neo</italic> probe (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>; Figure 1-figure supplement 3). The validated ES cells carrying the floxed <italic>LRRK1</italic> allele were injected into mouse blastocysts to generate floxed <italic>LRRK1</italic> mice, which were further confirmed by Southern using the 5’ and 3’ external probes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>). In the presence of Cre recombinase, the floxed <italic>LRRK1</italic> genomic region containing part of intron 26 (1,288 bp), exons 27-29, which encode the kinase domain, and part of intron 29 (1,023 bp) is deleted (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>), and the removal of exons 27-29 (625 bp) results in a frameshift of downstream codons.</p>

<p>The <italic>LRRK2</italic> targeting vector contains the 5’ homologous region, a <italic>loxP</italic> site 1,768 bp upstream of the transcription initiation site, exons 1-2, the <italic>PGK-neo</italic> cassette flanked by two <italic>loxP</italic> sites and two <italic>FRT</italic> sequences, and the 3’ homologous region (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B, E</xref>; Figure 1-figure supplement 4, 5). The ES cell clones carrying the targeted allele were identified and validated by Southern analysis using the 5’ external probe (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>; Figure 1-figure supplement 6) and genomic PCR followed by sequencing. Mice carrying the <italic>LRRK2</italic> targeted allele were further verified by Southern analysis using the 5’ and 3’ external probes (Figure 1-figure supplement 6) as well as the <italic>neo</italic> probe and were then crossed with the <italic>Actin-FLP</italic> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>) to remove the <italic>PGK-neo</italic> cassette flanked by two <italic>FRT</italic> sites to generate floxed <italic>LRRK2</italic> mice (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>). The resulting floxed <italic>LRRK2</italic> mice were confirmed by Southern analysis using the 5’ and 3’ external probes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>). In the presence of Cre recombinase, the floxed <italic>LRRK2</italic> region containing the promoter and exons 1-2 are deleted, likely resulting in a null allele, as we previously targeted a very similar region (∼2.5 kb upstream of the transcription initiation site and exons 1-2) to generate germline deletion of <italic>LRRK2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>).</p>
<p>Dopaminergic neurons in the SNpc are a small neuronal population embedded in the ventral midbrain, making it difficult to confirm whether DA neuron-specific deletions of the floxed <italic>LRRK1</italic> and <italic>LRRK2</italic> regions result in null alleles. We previously generated three independent <italic>LRRK1</italic> knockout (KO) mice, and only one KO line (Line 2) represents a <italic>LRRK1</italic> null allele (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>), whereas deletion of <italic>LRRK2</italic> promoter region and exons 1-2 resulted in a <italic>LRRK2</italic> null allele (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>). We therefore generated germline deleted <italic>LRRK1</italic> and <italic>LRRK2</italic> mice from floxed <italic>LRRK1</italic> and <italic>LRRK2</italic> mice, respectively, by crossing them to germline deleter <italic>CMV-Cre</italic> transgenic mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>).</p>
<p>We then performed Northern analysis of <italic>LRRK1</italic> using both an upstream probe specific for exons 2-3 and a downstream probe specific for exons 27-29 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G</xref>; Figure 1-figure supplement 7, 8). Because of the low expression level of <italic>LRRK1</italic> mRNA and the relative abundance of <italic>LRRK1</italic> mRNA in the lung (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>), we enriched polyA+ RNA from the lung of the mice carrying homozygous germline deleted (11/11) <italic>LRRK1</italic> alleles derived from the floxed <italic>LRRK1</italic> alleles. Using the exons 2-3 probe, the <italic>LRRK1</italic> transcripts in wild-type mice are of the expected size of ∼7.4 kb, whereas the detected <italic>LRRK1</italic> transcripts in <italic>LRRK1</italic> 11/11 mice are smaller and expressed at lower levels, consistent with the deletion of exons 27-29 (625 bp), resulting in a frameshift of downstream codons and the likely degradation of the truncated <italic>LRRK1</italic> mRNA (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G</xref>; Figure 1-figure supplement 8). Using a probe specific for exons 27-29, there is no <italic>LRRK1</italic> transcript in <italic>LRRK1</italic> 11/11 mice (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G</xref>; Figure 1-figure supplement 8). Extensive RT-PCR analysis of total RNA isolated from the kidney, brain, and lung of <italic>LRRK1</italic> 11/11 mice using an exon 32-specific primer for RT and exon-specific primer sets for PCR (<italic>e.g.</italic> exons 4-8, 11-17, 20-25, and 25-31), followed by sequencing confirmation of the PCR products, indicated normal <italic>LRRK1</italic> splicing in <italic>fLRRK1/fLRRK1</italic> mice and the lack of <italic>LRRK1</italic> exons 27-29 in <italic>LRRK1</italic> 11/11 mice (Figure 1-figure supplement 9).</p>
<p>Similarly, Northern analysis of <italic>LRRK2</italic> using a probe specific for exons 1-5 and RT-PCR followed by sequencing confirmed the absence of <italic>LRRK2</italic> mRNA in <italic>LRRK2</italic> 11/11 brains and normal <italic>LRRK2</italic> transcripts in <italic>fLRRK2/fLRRK2</italic> brains (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1H</xref>; Figure 1-figure supplement 10, 11). Furthermore, Western analysis confirmed the absence of LRRK1 and LRRK2 proteins in the brain of <italic>LRRK1</italic> 11/11 and <italic>LRRK2</italic> 11/11 mice, respectively (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1I</xref>). Taken together, our Northern, RT-PCR followed by sequencing, and Western analyses demonstrated that deletion of the floxed <italic>LRRK1</italic> and <italic>LRRK2</italic> alleles results in null mutations. Thus, floxed <italic>LRRK1</italic> and <italic>LRRK2</italic> alleles can be used to generate DA neuron-specific <italic>LRRK</italic> cDKO mice.</p>

<title>Age-dependent loss of TH+ DA neurons in the SNpc of <italic>LRRK</italic> cDKO mice</title>
<p>To determine whether the inactivation of LRRK selectively in DA neurons of the SNpc affects their survival, we performed TH immunostaining and quantified TH+ DA neurons in the SNpc of <italic>LRRK</italic> cDKO mice and littermate controls using stereological methods. The morphology of TH+ DA neurons in <italic>LRRK</italic> cDKO mice at the ages of 15, 20, and 24 months appears normal (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). Quantification of TH+ neurons in the SNpc using serial sections emcompassing the entire SNpc revealed that the number of DA neurons in the SNpc at the age of 15 months is similar between cDKO mice (10,000 ± 141) and littermate controls (10,077 ± 310; F<sub>1,46</sub> = 16.59, p = 0.0002, two-way ANOVA with Bonferroni’s <italic>post hoc</italic> multiple comparisons, p &gt; 0.9999; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>).

<title>Enhanced microgliosis in the SNpc of <italic>LRRK</italic> cDKO mice</title>
<p>To determine whether selective inactivation of LRRK in DA neurons results in elevated microgliosis in the SNpc of <italic>LRRK</italic> cDKO mice. We performed immunohistochemical analysis of Iba1, which labels microglia, and TH, which marks DA neurons and processes, thus showing the boundary of the SNpc (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8A-C</xref>).

<title>Impaired motor coordination of <italic>LRRK</italic> cDKO mice</title>
<p>To determine whether <italic>LRRK</italic> cDKO mice show motor deficits, we performed behavioral analysis of <italic>LRRK</italic> cDKO and littermate controls at the ages of 10 and 22 months using two versions of the elevated beam walk test with varying width of the beam (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9</xref>). <italic>LRRK</italic> cDKO mice at 10 months of age displayed significantly more hindlimb slips/errors (4.4 ± 0.5) and longer traversal time (7.3 ± 0.3) in the 10 mm beam walk test, relative to littermate controls, which exhibited fewer slips (2.0 ± 0.3, p = 0.0005, Student’s <italic>t</italic>-test) and shorter traversal time (5.8 ± 0.4, p = 0.0075; <xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9A</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>LRRK2 mutations are linked to familial PD and are also associated with sporadic PD with the G2019S mutation being the most common but exhibiting lower penetrance and higher age of onset (<italic>e.g.</italic> 74% at age 79) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>). Despite the importance of LRRK2 in PD pathogenesis, whether LRRK2 mutations cause DA neurodegeneration <italic>via</italic> a loss- or gain-of-function mechanism remains unresolved, even though the distinction between these two pathogenic mechanisms is critical for directing LRRK2-based PD therapeutic development. Neither <italic>LRRK2</italic>-deficient mice nor <italic>LRRK2</italic> R1441C and G2019S KI mice develop dopaminergic neurodegeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>). It was proposed that the lack of brain phenotypes in <italic>LRRK2</italic>-/- mice might be due to the presence of LRRK1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>), which is broadly expressed in the brain including the midbrain (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000154237-LRRK1/brain">https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000154237-LRRK1/brain</ext-link>). Indeed, germline deletions of LRRK2 and LRRK1 results in age-dependent loss of DA neurons and increases of apoptosis and microgliosis in the SNpc of <italic>LRRK</italic> DKO mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>). However, the pleiotropic roles of LRRK1 and LRRK2 in the kidney (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>), lung (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>), and bone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>), and the observed earlier mortality and lower body weight in <italic>LRRK</italic> DKO mice raised the possibility that DA neurodegeneration in <italic>LRRK</italic> DKO mice may be due to poor health.</p>
<p>To address this question, we generated floxed <italic>LRRK1</italic> and <italic>LRRK2</italic> mice (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>, Figure1-figure supplement 1-10) and DA neuron-specific <italic>LRRK</italic> cDKO mice using the <italic>DAT-Cre</italic> KI allele (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>) to delete floxed <italic>LRRK1</italic> and <italic>LRRK2</italic> regions selectively in DA neurons (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). Using an EGFP reporter, we found that <italic>DAT-Cre</italic> drives Cre-mediated recombination in almost all DA neurons in the SNpc. Unlike germline DKO mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>), DA neuron-specific <italic>LRRK</italic> cDKO mice exhibit normal body weight and mortality during mouse lifespan. Importantly, <italic>LRRK</italic> cDKO mice develop age-dependent, progressive DA neurodegeneration, as evidenced by the normal number of DA neurons at the age of 15 months and the progressive reduction of DA neurons in the SNpc at the ages of 20 and 24 months (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>), accompanied with increases of apoptotic DA neurons in the SNpc (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>) and decreases of DA terminals in the striatum (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>), whereas the number of noradrenergic neurons in the LC is unchanged, consistent with the lack of Cre-mediated recombination in the LC by <italic>DAT-Cre</italic> (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>). Moreover, <italic>LRRK</italic> cDKO mice exhibit impaired performance in a narrow beam walk, a behavioral paradigm sensitive to altered motor coordination (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9</xref>). Furthermore, microgliosis is elevated in the SNpc of <italic>LRRK</italic> cDKO mice, even though LRRK expression in microglia is unaffected in these mice, suggesting a cell extrinsic microglial response to pathophygiological changes in DA neurons (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref>). The molecular mechanism by which LRRK supports cell autonomous DA neuron survival is unknown. Single-cell RNA sequencing of dissected ventral midbrains may permit identification of genes and pathways that are selectively altered in DA neurons of <italic>LRRK</italic> cDKO mice before and after the onset of DA neurodegeneration.</p>
<p>Interestingly, quantitative EM analysis showed similar numbers of electron-dense vacuoles in the SNpc of <italic>LRRK</italic> cDKO and control mice at 25 months of age (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>), in contrast to age-dependent increases of vacuoles in the SNpc of <italic>LRRK</italic> DKO mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>), suggesting non-DA neurons (<italic>e.g.</italic> microglia), in which LRRK expression is unaffected in DA neuron-specific <italic>LRRK</italic> cDKO mice but is absent in germline DKO mice, may contribute to this phenotypic difference. Development of microglia- and/or astrocyte-specific <italic>LRRK</italic> cDKO mice would permit further dissection of cell autonomous and non-cell autonomous roles of LRRK in DA neuron survival and determine whether glial LRRK plays a more important role in the regulation of the autophagy-lysosomal pathway and protein turnover. It would also be interesting to test whether reducing LRRK expression or function affects accumulation and aggregation of human mutant α-synuclein and tau in the aging brain, as both Lewy bodies and tauopathies are associated with PD patients carrying LRRK2 mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>).</p>
<p>The toxic gain-of-function pathogenic mechanism was initially proposed based on <italic>in vitro</italic> kinase assays using recombinant mutant LRRK2, which showed that R1441C and G2019S resulted in increases of autophosphorylation and phosphorylation of a generic substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>). Subsequent biochemical studies further reported that LRRK2 mutations (<italic>e.g.</italic> R1441C/G, G2019S) enhanced kinase activity, leading to elevated levels of pSer1292-LRRK2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>) as well as pT73-Rab10 and pS106-Rab12 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>). While these biochemical changes are excellent biomarkers of LRRK2 mutations, there is no experimental evidence showing that increased phosphorylation of LRRK2 substrates drives DA neurodegeneration.</p>
<p>The loss-of-function pathogenic mechanism was prompted by mouse knockout findings showing that germline inactivation of LRRK results in age-dependent loss of DA neurons in the SNpc and DA terminals in the striatum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>). The current study demonstrated a cell intrinsic role of LRRK in support of DA neuron survival in the SNpc of the aging brain, providing an unequovacal genetic evidence of an essential, cell autonomous requirement of LRRK in DA neurons. While most transgenic mice overexpressing mutant LRRK2 did not produce neurodegeneration or DA neuron loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>), two studies reported that overexpression of LRRK2 G2019S but not R1441C resulted in DA neurodegeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>). These transgenic mouse results are intriguing, as R1441C is a more potent causative mutaion (highly penetrant, in a critical amino acid residue harboring 3 distinct PD mutations), whereas G2019S is known to be a weaker mutation with lower penetrance and older age of disease onset.</p>
<p>It remains possible that the relevant physiological role of LRRK in protection of DA neuron survival during aging may be irrelevant to how LRRK2 mutations cause DA neurodegeneration and PD. Two reports of genomic database analysis suggested that loss-of-function <italic>LRRK2</italic> and <italic>LRRK1</italic> variants are not associated with PD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>), which were sometimes taken as conclusive evidence for LRRK2 mutations not being loss of function One study was a predictive analysis using several available sequencing databases (141,456 individuals sequenced in the Genome Aggregation Database, 49,960 exome-sequenced individuals from the UK Biobank, and more than 4 million participants in the 23andMe genotyped dataset), and the authors cautiously stated that heterozygous predicted loss-of-function variants are not strongly associated with PD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>). Another study analyzed next-generation sequencing data from 11,095 PD patients and 12,615 controls, and found that <italic>LRRK1</italic> loss-of-function variants were identified in 0.205% PD cases and 0.139% of controls, whereas <italic>LRRK2</italic> loss-of-function variants were found in 0.117% of PD cases and 0.087% of controls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>). In contrast to linkage studies of large pedigrees with mutations segregating completely with the disease but being absent among control populations, these genomic database analyses are considerably weaker with the results suggestive but highly inconclusive. For example, while the occurrence of these loss-of-function variants among PD patients is not statistically different from those among control populations, a larger sample size may change this outcome. Furthermore, such sequencing data tend to be from highly heterogeneous populations, contributing to further complexity. Moreover, it is quite possible that haploinsufficency or heterozygous complete loss of function mutations are not sufficient to cause the disease; rather a dominant negative mechanism coupled with loss of function missense mutations may be at play, reducing overall protein function further, especially if dimers are the functional entities. Therefore, these studies are interesting but inconclusive as to whether loss-of-function mutations in LRRK2 or LRRK1 cause or do not cause PD.</p>
<p>Genetically, it is well-known that missense mutations may gain a toxic function or may cause a partial loss of function <italic>in cis</italic> and a dominant negative inhibition of wild-type protein <italic>in trans</italic>, further reducing function. Missense mutations in the <italic>PSEN</italic> genes linked to familial Alzheimer’s disease are good examples of such a loss-of-function coupled with a dominant negative mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref>). While PD-linked <italic>LRRK2</italic> mutations are mostly dominantly inherited missense mutations, though homozygous R1441H carriers have been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>), variants in LRRK1 have also been reported with inconclusive pathogenicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref>). The notion that mutant LRRK2 may act in a dominant negative manner to inhibit the activity of wild-type LRRK2 is supported by structural and functional studies of LRRK2 as homodimers or heterodimers with LRRK1(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref>). Furthermore, LRRK2 G2385R variant, a risk factor of PD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">73</xref>), has been reported as a partial loss-of-function mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">74</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">75</xref>). Future studies are needed to reconcile the biochemical findings of elevated kinase activity by LRRK2 mutations and the genetic findings of an essential physiological requirement of LRRK in DA neuron survival, and to determine whether LRRK2 mutations impair this relevant physiological function in protecting DA neurons while increasing kinase activity.</p>

<title>LRRK1</title>
<p>To generate the <italic>LRRK1</italic> targeting vector, we first PCR amplified the <italic><underline>left middle</underline></italic> homologous region (2,079 bp) containing partial intron 26, exon 27, and partial intron 27 of <italic>LRRK1</italic> from mouse BAC DNA (clone RP23-213J23, BACPAC Resources Center) using primers, P3 and P4. The PCR fragment was subcloned into the <italic>pGEM-T</italic> vector (A1360, Promega) to generate pLM1 (for details, see <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>-figure supplement 1). The <italic><underline>right middle</underline></italic> homologous region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>,403) containing <italic>LRRK1</italic> genomic region from partial intron 27 to partial intron 29 was amplified by PCR using primers, P5 and P6, and then subcloned into the <italic>pGEM-T</italic> vector (pLM2). The <italic><underline>left middle</underline></italic> homologous region containing <italic>pGEM-T</italic> plasmid was then digested with <italic>Not</italic>I and <italic>Kpn</italic>I (endogenous <italic>Kpn</italic>I site in the intron 27) and subcloned into the <italic>Not</italic>I and <italic>Kpn</italic>I sites of the <italic><underline>right middle</underline></italic> homologous region containing <italic>pGEM-T</italic> plasmid (pLM3). After that, the <italic><underline>middle</underline></italic> homologous region (5.5 kb), from partial intron 26 to partial intron 29, was released by <italic>Not</italic>I and <italic>Sac</italic>II digestions and was blunted by Klenow, and then subcloned into the <italic>Sma</italic>I site of <italic>PGKneoF2L2DTA</italic> vector (#13445, addgene) to generate the <italic><underline>middle</underline></italic> homologous region-<italic>PGKneoF2L2DTA</italic> plasmid (pLM4).</p>
<p>The <italic><underline>left</underline></italic> homologous region (2,016 bp) containing partial intron 25, exon 26, and partial intron 27 of <italic>LRRK1</italic> was PCR amplified from mouse BAC DNA (clone RP23-213J23, BACPAC Resources Center) using primers, P1 and P2. The PCR fragment was digested with <italic>Sac</italic>II (introduced by P1) and <italic>Not</italic>I (introduced by P2 along with <italic>Hind</italic>III), and was subcloned into the <italic>Sac</italic>II and <italic>Not</italic>I sites of the <italic>PGKneoF2L2DTA</italic> vector (pLM5). The <italic><underline>right</underline></italic> homologous region (3,131 bp) containing partial intron 29, exon 30, and partial intron 30 of <italic>LRRK1</italic> was PCR amplified from mouse BAC DNA (clone RP23-213J23) using primers, P7 and P8. The PCR fragment was digested with <italic>Sal</italic>I (introduced by P7) and <italic>Hind</italic>III (introduced by P8), and was subcloned into the <italic>Sal</italic>I and <italic>Hind</italic>III sites of the <italic>PGKneoF2L2DTA</italic> vector (pLM6).</p>
<p>The <italic><underline>left</underline></italic> homologous region in the <italic>PGKneoF2L2DAT</italic> vector (pLM5) was digested with <italic>Sac</italic>II and <italic>Not</italic>I, and subcloned into the <italic>Sac</italic>II and <italic>Not</italic>I sites of the <italic><underline>right</underline></italic> homologous region containing <italic>pGKneoF2L2DTA</italic> plasmid (pLM6) to generate pLM7. Finally, the <italic><underline>loxP-middle</underline></italic> homologous region-<italic>PGK-Neo</italic>-<italic>loxP</italic> fragment was released from pLM4 by <italic>Not</italic>I and <italic>Sal</italic>I digestions, and subcloned into the <italic>Not</italic>I and <italic>Sal</italic>I sites of pLM7 to generate the final target vector (pLM8), which contains two <italic>loxP</italic> sites (intron 26 and intron 29). Upon Cre-mediated recombination, the endogenous <italic>LRRK1</italic> genomic sequence flanked by the 5’ <italic>loxP</italic> site (1,288 bp upstream of <italic>LRRK1</italic> exon 27) to the 3’ <italic>loxP</italic> site (1,023 bp downstream of exon 29) is excised. The <italic>PGK-neo</italic> cassette flanked by two <italic>FRT</italic> sites is under the control of the mouse <italic>phosphoglycerate kinase 1</italic> (<italic>PGK</italic>) promoter and contains the <italic>bovine growth hormone</italic> polyA signal. To enhance the ratio of ES cells carrying homologous recombination events instead of random insertion of the targeting vector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">77</xref>), the negative selection <italic>PGK-DTA</italic> cassette, which encodes diphtheria toxin A chain, was also included in the <italic>LRRK1</italic> targeting vector.</p>
<p>The <italic>LRRK1</italic> targeting vector was linearized by <italic>Xho</italic>I digestion, and then electroporated into MKV6.5 embryonic stem (ES) cells (a gift from R. Jaenisch), which were derived from B6/129 F1 mice (The Jackson Laboratory, IMSR_JAX:101043). G418 was applied to the culture at 150 μg/ml 24 h later, and after 6 days of G418 selection, the surviving ES clones (480) were picked and screened by Southern analysis using <italic>Hind</italic>III digestion of genomic DNA followed by hybridization with the 5’ external and 3’ external probes to confirm proper recombination events in the 5’ and 3’ homologous regions, respectively. 25 ES cell clones were confirmed to carry the proper homologous recombination events at the 5’ homologous region, giving rise to the 17.0 kb and the 4.8 kb bands, which represent the wild-type and the targeted allele, respectively (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>), and the 3’ homologous region, giving rise to the 17.0 kb and the 14.1 kb bands, which represent the wild-type and the targeted allele, respectively. We then expanded the selected 4 ES cell clones (3A11, 3D8, 3H1, and 3H6) and further verified by Southern using the 5’ and 3’ external, and <italic>neo</italic> probes. Two ES cell clones (3D8 and 3H6) were transfected with <italic>pCAGGS-flpE-puro</italic> (#20733, addgene) to delete the <italic>PGK-neo</italic> cassette by FLP recombinase. Three resulting ES cell clones (3D8C5, 3D8E5, and 3H6G7) were confirmed by Southern analysis using the 5’ and 3’ external probes and the <italic>neo</italic> probe to confirm the floxed <italic>LRRK1</italic> allele by the deletion of the <italic>PGK-neo</italic> cassette.</p>

<title>LRRK2</title>
<p>To generate the <italic>LRRK2</italic> targeting vector, the <italic><underline>left</underline></italic> homologous region (2,579 bp) containing the <italic>LRRK2</italic> promoter region was PCR amplified from mouse BAC DNA (clone RP23-526A2, BACPAC Resources Center) using primers, P9 and P10, and subcloned into the <italic>pGEM-T</italic> vector to generate pLRRK2#1 (for details see <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>-figure supplement 4). The <italic>BamH</italic>I-<italic>loxP</italic>-<italic>Nhe</italic>I-<italic>Spe</italic>I fragment (56 bp), which was generated by annealing two complementary oligos, P39 and P40, was introduced to the <italic>BamH</italic>I and <italic>Spe</italic>I sites of pLRRK2#1 to generate pLRRK2#2. The <italic><underline>middle</underline></italic> homologous region, containing genomic sequences from the promoter region to partial intron 2, was PCR amplified from mouse BAC DNA (clone RP23-526A2) using primers, P11 and P12, digested with <italic>Xba</italic>I and <italic>Not</italic>I, and subcloned into the <italic>Xba</italic>I and <italic>Not</italic>I sites of the <italic>pGEM-T</italic> vector to generate pLRRK2#3, which was digested with <italic>Xba</italic>I and <italic>Not</italic>I, and subcloned into the <italic>Xba</italic>I and <italic>Not</italic>I sites of pLRRK2#2 to generate pLRRK2#4.</p>
<p>The <italic><underline>right</underline></italic> homologous region (3,503 bp), which contains partial intron 1, exon 2, and partial intron 2, was PCR amplified from mouse BAC DNA (clone RP23-526A2) using primers, P13 and P14, and the PCR fragment was subcloned into the <italic>EcoR</italic>V site of <italic>pBluescript II KS</italic> (+) vector (212207, Agilent) to generate pLRRK2#5. The <italic><underline>right</underline></italic> homologous region in pLRRK2#5 was digested with <italic>BamH</italic>I followed by Klenow, and then digested with <italic>Cla</italic>I. The released fragment was subcloned into the <italic>EcoR</italic>V and <italic>Cla</italic>I sites of the <italic>PGKneoF2L2DTA</italic> vector to generate pLRRK2#6. <italic>LFNT-tk/pBS</italic> plasmid (a gift from S. Tonegawa) was digested with <italic>Sac</italic>II (followed by Klenow) and <italic>Not</italic>I (followed by <italic>Ssp</italic>I digestion to make it easier to isolate the <italic>Not</italic>I<italic>-Sac</italic>II/KN fragment) to release the <italic>loxP-FRT-PKG-neo-loxP-FRT</italic> fragment (2,928 bp), and then subcloned into the <italic>Xba</italic>I (followed by Klenow) and <italic>Not</italic>I sites of pLRRK2#6 to generate pLRRK2#7. Finally, pLRRK2#4 containing the <italic><underline>left-loxP-middle</underline></italic> homologous regions was digested with <italic>EcoR</italic>V and <italic>Not</italic>I, and subcloned into <italic>Ale</italic>I and <italic>Not</italic>I sites of pLRRK2#7 containing the <italic><underline>loxP-FRT-PKG-neo-loxP-FRT-right</underline></italic> homologous region to generate the final targeting vector, which contains the <italic>loxP</italic> sites in the promoter region (1,768 bp upstream of the transcription initiation site) and in <italic>LRRK2</italic> intron 2 (878 bp downstream of exon 2). Upon Cre-mediated recombination, the floxed endogenous <italic>LRRK2</italic> genomic sequences from the 5’ <italic>loxP</italic> site (1,768 bp upstream of <italic>LRRK2</italic> transcription) to the 3’ <italic>loxP</italic> site in intron 2 (878 bp downstream of exon 2) are excised. The negative selection <italic>PGK-DTA</italic> cassette is also included in the <italic>LRRK2</italic> targeting vector.</p>
<p>The <italic>LRRK2</italic> targeting vector was linearized by <italic>Ahd</italic>I digestion, and then electroporated into MKV6.5 ES cells. G418 was applied to the culture at 150 ug/ml 24 h later, and after 6 days of G418 selection, the surviving ES clones (480) were picked and screened by Southern analysis using <italic>Nhe</italic>I digestion of genomic DNA followed by hybridization with the 5’ external probe (753 bp, PCR amplified using P19 and P20). Southern analysis confirmed that two ES cell clones (N24 and N34) carry the proper recombination event in the 5’ homologous arm, giving rise to 11.6 kb and 3.6 kb bands, which represent the wild-type and targeted alleles, respectively (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>), followed by genomic PCR confirmation for the proper recombination in the right arm.</p>
<p>Three (3D8C5, 3A11, 3H6) and one (N24) ES clones for <italic>LRRK1</italic> and <italic>LRRK2</italic>, respectively, were microinjected into C57BL/6 mouse blastocysts to generate chimera mice, which were bred with B6/129 F1 mice to produce heterozygous floxed <italic>LRRK1</italic> and targeted <italic>LRRK2</italic> mice. Floxed <italic>LRRK1</italic> mice were confirmed by Southern analysis using the 5’ and 3’ external probes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>). Targeted <italic>LRRK2</italic> mice were confirmed by Southern (data shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>-figure supplement 6; <italic>Nhe</italic>I digestion followed by hybridization with the 5’ external probe and <italic>Sph</italic>I digestion followed by hybridization with the 3’ external probe). Targeted <italic>LRRK2</italic> mice were then bred with <italic>Actin-FLP</italic> deleter mice (IMSR_JAX:005703) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>) to generate floxed <italic>LRRK2</italic> mice, which were confirmed by Southern analysis using the 5’ and 3’ external probes following <italic>Nhe</italic>I digestion (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>). Heterozygous <italic>fLRRK1</italic>/+ and <italic>fLRRK2</italic>/+ mice were crossed with each other to obtain homozygous single floxed mice (<italic>fLRRK1/fLRRK1</italic> and <italic>fLRRK2</italic>/<italic>fLRRK2</italic>) and double floxed mice (<italic>fLRRK1/fLRRK1</italic>; <italic>fLRRK2</italic>/<italic>fLRRK2</italic>).</p>

<title>Generation of deleted <italic>LRRK1/LRRK2</italic> alleles and DA neuron-specific cDKO mice</title>
<p>In order to ensure that Cre-mediated deletion of the floxed <italic>LRRK1</italic> and <italic>LRRK2</italic> alleles results in null alleles, we crossed floxed <italic>LRRK1</italic> and <italic>LRRK2</italic> mice with germline deleter, <italic>CMV-Cre</italic> transgenic mice (<italic>B6.C-Tg(CMV-cre)1Cgn/J</italic>; IMSR_JAX:006054) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>), to generate <italic>LRRK1</italic> deleted (11/11) mice (by removing exons 27-29) and <italic>LRRK2</italic> deleted (11/11) mice (by removing the promoter region and exons 1-2) for further molecular characterization. To generate DA neuron-specific <italic>LRRK1</italic>/<italic>LRRK2</italic> cDKO mice, we used <italic>DAT-Cre</italic> KI mice (<italic>B6.SJL-Slc6a3tm1.1(cre)Bkmn/J;</italic> IMSR_JAX:006660), which express Cre recombinase under the control of the endogenous <italic>DAT</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>).

<p>For immunofluorescence staining of paraffin sections, coronal sections were deparaffinized, alcohol-dehydrated, and then subjected to permeabilization with a solution containing 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS followed by antigen retrieval for 5 min in 10 mM sodium citrate buffer, pH 6.0 except those for cleaved-caspase3 immunostaining which were performed antigen retrieval for 10 min. Sections were then blocked with a solution containing 10% normal goat serum and 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 1 hr at room temperature. After blocking, sections were incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4°C. The primary antibodies used were mouse anti-TH (1:50, sc-25269, Santa Cruz, RRID: AB_628422), rabbit anti-NeuN (1:400, 12943S, Cell Signaling Technology, RRID: AB_2630395), rabbit anti-cleaved caspases-3 (1:150, 9661, Cell Signaling Technology, RRID: AB_2341188), or rabbit anti-Iba1 (1:500, 019-19,751, Wako, RRID: AB_839504). Sections were washed three times in 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS followed by 1 hr incubation with fluorophore-conjugated secondary antibodies, goat anti-mouse IgG Alexa Fluor 488 (1:500, A11001, ThermoFisher, RRID: AB_2534069) and goat anti-rabbit IgG Alexa Fluor 555 (1:500, A32732, ThermoFisher, RRID: AB_2633281) at room temperature. Fluorescence images were taken (a stack of 2-3 confocal images spaced at 4 μm), projected with maximal intensity projection mode, and analyzed by FV1000 confocal microscope system (Olympus).</p>
<p>For immunofluorescence staining of cryopreserved sections, coronal brain sections were washed with PBS to rinse out OCT, and then blocked with a solution containing 5% normal goat serum and 0.1% Triton X-100 in TBS for 1 hr at room temperature. After blocking with 10% NGS, sections were incubated with primary antibodies, rabbit anti-GFP (1: 1000, ab290, abcam, RRID: AB_303395), and mouse anti-TH (1:50, sc-25269, Santa Cruz, RRID: AB_628422), overnight at 4°C.

<p>The number of GFP+ and GFP+/TH+ cells in the SNpc of <italic>DAT-IRES-Cre/+; Rosa26-CAG-LSL-ZsGreen1/+</italic> reporter mice were quantified using 3 comparable coronal sections (16 µm in thickness, spaced 320 μm apart) per brain (n = 3 brains, one hemisphere). The percentage of GFP+ DA neurons in the SNpc was obtained by dividing the sum of GPF+/TH+ neurons by the sum of total TH+ neurons quantified.</p>

<title>Quantification of DA neurons in the SNpc</title>
<p>Quantification of TH+ DA neurons in the SNpc or LC was performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">76</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">78</xref>). Briefly, TH+ neurons in the SNpc, which were marked based on morphological features as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">79</xref>), were quantified in every 10<sup>th</sup> serial coronal section (16 µm in thickness) throughout the SNpc (a total of 6-9 sections, spaced 160 µm apart). Total number of TH+ cells in the SNpc was calculated as follows: [total number of TH+ DA neurons quantified in all 6-9 sections] x 10 (every 10<sup>th</sup> section sampled) x 2 (both hemispheres). Total number of TH+ noradrenergic neurons in the LC (a total of 6-9 sections, spaced 80 µm apart) was calculated as follows: [total number of TH+ noradrenergic neurons quantified in all 6-9 sections] x 5 (every 5<sup>th</sup> section sampled) x 2 (both hemispheres).</p>
<p>DA neuron quantification was also performed independently by another investigator, also in a genotype blind manner, using stereological quantification of 25% of the SNpc area. The fractionator with 100 μm x 100 μm was set up in the SNpc, and TH+ DA neurons were counted using the optical dissector method with 50 μm x 50 μm sample box (25% of the total area). Total number of TH+ cells in the SNpc was calculated as follows: [total number of TH+ DA neurons quantified in sample boxes of all 6-9 sections] x 10 (every 10<sup>th</sup> section sampled) x 4 (1/4 area sampled: 50 x 50/100 x 100) x 2 (both hemispheres).</p>

<title>Quantification of NeuN+ neurons, apoptotic cells, Iba1+ microglia in the SNpc</title>
<p>NeuN+, active Caspase-3+, or Iba1+ cells in the SNpc, which was marked by TH immunoreactivity, were quantified using serial coronal sections (16 μm in thickness, every 10<sup>th</sup> section, a total of 6-9 sections per brain). Compared to DAB immunostaining followed by counting under the stereomicroscope, which captures TH-positive DA neurons in a single cell layer of the brain section, immunofluorescent staining picks up more cells (<italic>e.g.</italic> TH+ or NeuN+) in multiple layers of the brain section under the confocal microscope by the maximal intensity projection mode. Thus, more TH-positive DA neurons in the SNpc were captured and quantified under confocal microscopy compared to DAB staining. The total number of NeuN+ cells in the SNpc was calculated by multiplying the total number of NeuN+ cells in all sections counted] x 10 (every 10<sup>th</sup> section sampled) x 2 (both hemispheres). The total number of active Caspase-3+ or Iba1+ cells in the SNpc, which was marked by TH immunoreactivity, was calculated as follows: [total number of active Caspase-3+ or Iba1+ cells in all sections counted from one hemisphere] x 10 (every 10<sup>th</sup> section sampled).</p>

<title>Quantification of TH+ DA terminals in the striatum</title>
<p>For quantification of TH immunoreactivity in the striatum, we performed immunostaining using every 10<sup>th</sup> serial coronal sections (16 µm in thickness) throughout the entire striatum (a total of 12-15 sections, spaced 160 µm apart). The images of TH immunoreactivity in the striatum were captured under 2X objective lens (Olympus BX40, 8-bit RGB camera) using identical exposure time, sensitivity, brightness, contrast, and gamma (CellSens Entry Software) and then analyzed using the Fiji version of ImageJ, and the optical density was determined as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">80</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">81</xref>). The mean value of TH immunoreactivity in the striatum of control mice of each age group was set as 100%.</p>

<title>Quantitative EM analysis</title>
<p>The collection and quantification of the EM images were performed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>). Mice were perfused with PBS containing 0.25 g/L heparin and 5 g/L procaine followed by a fixative solution containing 2.5% paraformaldehyde and 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer (pH 7.4) (#1549, Electron Microscopy Science). Brains were dissected and post-fixed overnight in a fixative solution at 4°C. The dissected tissues were trimmed to 1-2 mm<sup>3</sup> cubes followed by osmication and uranyl acetate staining, dehydration in graded alcohol, and embedded in TABB 812 Resin (Marivac Ltd.) at the Harvard Medical School EM facility. 0.5 μm sections were stained with toluidine blue and viewed under the light stereomicroscope (Nikon Eclips E600) to find the SNpc area for EM viewing. Then adjacent sections were cut with 80 nm in thickness with the Leica Ultracut S microtome, picked up on formvar-carbon coated slot Copper grids, stained with 0.2% Lead Citrate, and viewed and imaged under the JEOL 1200x Electron Microscope. A minimum of 10 micrographs containing the entire cell body in the SNpc area were analyzed for each brain. The image was analyzed by using the Fiji version of ImageJ. The number of electron-dense autophagic and lysosomal vacuoles (&gt;0.5 μm in diameter) in individual neuronal profiles was quantified. We previously calculated the diameter of electron-dense autophagic/lysosomal vacuoles by measuring the longest side manually (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>). In the current study, we used Feret’s Diameter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">82</xref>) to accurately measure the longest distance between any of two points in the electron-dense autophagic/lysosomal vacuoles, resulting in a higher number of electron-dense vacuoles quantified. The number and the area of electron-dense vacuoles (&gt;0.5 μm in diameter) in individual neuronal profiles was quantified, and the average number or area of vacuoles per mouse was calculated. Experiments were done in a genotype blind manner (after scarifying mice, the brain samples were coded and sent to the Harvard Medical School EM Core, where the images were captured, and the vacuoles were quantified by another independent experimenter).</p>

<title>Behavioral analysis</title>
<p>Naive <italic>LRRK</italic> cDKO mice and littermate controls at 10 and 22 months of age were used. Mice were acclimated in the behavior facility for a minimum of 7 days and were then individually handled daily for 5 consecutive days before testing. Mice were coded so the experimenter was unaware of their genotypes until the data analysis was complete. In the beam walk test, a Plexiglas beam of 100 cm in length (Plastic Zone), 20 mm or 10 mm in width, was raised 60 cm above a table, and safety bedding was placed under the beam to avoid any harm in case of falls. Mice were placed onto the starting point of the beam in bright light, and the time (in seconds) to reach their home cage on the other darker side of the beam (∼80 cm in distance) as well as the hindpaw slips (number of hindlimb errors) were recorded. Mice were trained three trials per day for 2 consecutive days to traverse the 20 mm beam (without the wire mesh) to their home cage. On the test day, mice were trained further with two additional trials on the 20 mm beam (without the wire mesh). Mice were then tested in two successive trials on the 20 mm beam (with the wire mesh) followed by two consecutive test trials on the 10 mm beam (with the wire mesh). All test trials were videotaped, and the travel time and the number of hindlimb errors were recorded. Between trials mice were placed in the home cage for 2 min to rest. Mice that fell off the beam during both trials or stalled on the beam for more than 120 sec during the test were excluded.</p>
<p>In the pole test, mice were placed on top of the pole (60 cm in height, 10 mm in diameter) with their head facing upward, and the base of the pole was placed in the home cage. Mice were trained three trials per day for 2 days to traverse the pole to the cage floor and were further trained two trials before testing on the test day. Mice were then tested for 2 trials, and the time to turn around (turning time) and the time to descend the pole (descending time) were recorded. Between trials, mice were placed in the home cage for 2 min to rest. Mice that stalled on the top of the pole for more than 120 sec were excluded.</p>

<title>Experimental design and statistical analysis</title>
<p>All experiments were performed in a genotype blind manner with the exception of molecular analysis (Southern, Northern, RT-PCR, and Western). All statistical analyses were performed using Prism 9 (GraphPad software) or Excel (Microsoft). All data are presented as the means ± SEM. The exact sample size of each experiment is indicated in the figure or the legend. The slight difference in sample size among various histological analysis (<italic>e.g.</italic> at 24M, 11 control and 8 cDKO brains analyzed for TH+ cells but 9 control and 8 cDKO analyzed for NeuN+, Caspase-3+, Iba1+ cells in the SNpc) is due to the paraffin blocks used for quantification (each paraffin block contains 7 brains of mixed genotypes; for details see Source Data files) or specific brain sections being damaged, thus, excluded in the analysis.</p>
<p>Statistical analyses were conducted using an unpaired two-tailed Student’s <italic>t</italic>-test for the comparison of a given variable in two genotypes or two-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni’s <italic>post hoc</italic> comparisons for the comparison of more than two conditions. Statistical outliers were identified and excluded using the ROUT method with 1% the maximum desired false discovery rate developed by Prism, and the only statistical outliers of the current study were identified in the behavioral analysis and were marked in <xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9</xref> - Source Data. All statistical analysis was performed on data from ≥ 4 mouse brains per genotype per age group, and experiments were performed and repeated on different days, often by independent investigators. Statistical significance is indicated as *p &lt; 0.05, **p &lt; 0.01, ***p &lt; 0.001, ****p &lt; 0.0001, and values not significantly different are often not noted.</p>

<p>This current revision builds on observations in validated conditional double KO (cDKO) mice for LRRK1 and LRRK2 that will be <bold>useful</bold> for the field, given that LRRK2 is widely expressed in the brain and periphery, and many divergent phenotypes have been attributed previously to LRRK2 expression. The manuscript presents <bold>solid</bold> data demonstrating that it is the loss of LRRK1 and LRRK2 expression within the SNpc DA cells that is not well tolerated, as it was previously unclear from past work whether neurodegeneration in the LRRK double Knock Out (DKO) was cell autonomous or the result of loss of LRRK1/LRRK2 expression in other types of cells. Future studies may pursue the biochemical mechanisms underlying the reason for the apoptotic cells noted in this study, as here, the LRRK1/LRRK2 KO mice did not replicate the dramatic increase in autophagic vacuole numbers previously noted in the germline global LRRK1/LRRK2 KO mice.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This is an important work showing that loss of LRRK function causes late-onset dopaminergic neurodegeneration in a cell-autonomous manner. One of the LRRK members, LRRK2, is of significant translational importance as mutations in LRRK2 cause late-onset autosomal dominant Parkinson's disease (PD). While many in the field assume that LRRK2 mutant causes PD via increased LRRK2 activity (i.e., kinase activity), it is not a settled issue as not all disease-causing mutant LRRK2 exhibits increased activity. Further, while LRRK2 inhibitors are under clinical trials for PD, the consequence of chronic, long-term LRRK2 inhibition is unknown. Thus, studies evaluating the long-term impact of LRRK deficit have important translational implications. Moreover, because LRRK proteins, particularly LRRK2, are known to modulate immune response and intracellular membrane trafficking, the study's results and the reagents will be valuable for others interested in LRRK function.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This report describes a mouse model where LRRK1 and LRRK2 genes are conditionally deleted in dopaminergic neurons. Previously, this group showed that while loss of LRRK2 expression does not cause brain phenotype, loss of both LRRK1 and LRRK2 causes a later onset, progressive degeneration of catecholaminergic neurons, dopaminergic (DAergic) neurons in the substantia nigra (SN) and noradrenergic neurons in the Locus Coeruleus (LC). However, because LRRK genes are widely expressed with some peripheral phenotypes, it was unknown if the neurodegeneration in LRRK double Knock Out (DKO) was cell autonomous. To rigorously test this question, the authors generated a double conditional KO allele where both LRRK1 and LRRK2 genes were targeted to contain loxP sites. This was beyond what is usually required as most investigators might just have combined one KO allele with another floxed allele. The authors provide a rigorous validation showing that the Driver (DAT-Cre) is expressed in most DAergic neurons in SN and that LRRK levels are decreased selectively in the ventral midbrain. Using these mice, the authors show that the number of DA neurons is average at 15 but significantly decreased at 20 months of age. Moreover, the authors show that the number of apoptotic neurons is increased by ~2X in aged SN, demonstrating increased ongoing cell death and activated microglia. The degeneration is limited to DA neurons as LC neurons are not lost, and this population does not express DAT. Overall, the mouse genetics and experimental analysis were performed rigorously, and the results were statistically sound and compelling.</p>
<p>Weakness:</p>
<p>I only have a few minor comments. First, in PD and other degenerative conditions, axon and terminal loss occur prior to cell bodies. It might be beneficial to show the status of DAergic markers in the striatum. Second, previous studies indicate that very little, if any, LRRK1 is expressed in SN DAergic neurons. This also the case with the Allen Brain Atlas profile. Thus, the authors should discuss the discrepancy, as they imply significant LRRK1 expression in DA neurons.</p>
<p>Revision:</p>
<p>I appreciate the authors revising the manuscript with additional data that have clarified my prior comments. They now show that TH levels in the striatum decrease with SNpc neurons. Further, while there is some disagreement regarding the expression LRRK1 in SNpc, the authors provide a convincing case that LRRK1 function is important in SNpc DA neurons.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this manuscript, Shen and collaborators described the generation of conditional double knockout (cDKO) mice lacking LRRK1 and LRRK2 selectively in DAT-positive dopaminergic neurons. The Authors asked whether selective deletion of both LRRK isoforms could lead to a Parkinsonian phenotype, as previously reported by the same group in germline double LRRK1 and LRRK2 knockout mice (PMID: 29056298). Indeed, cDKO mice developed a late reduction of TH+ neurons in SNpc that partially correlated with the reduction of NeuN+ cells. This was associated with increased apoptotic cell and microglial cell numbers in SNpc. Unlike the constitutive DKO mice described earlier, cDKO mice did not replicate the dramatic increase in autophagic vacuole numbers. The study supports the authors' hypothesis that loss of function rather than gain of function of LRRK2 leads to Parkinson's Disease.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>For the first time, the study described a model in which both the Parkinson's disease-associated gene LRRK2 and its homolog LRRK1 are deleted selectively in dopaminergic neurons. This offers a new tool to understand the physiopathological role of LRRK2 and the compensating role of LRRK1 in modulating dopaminergic cell function.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The model has no construct validity since loss of function mutations of LRRK2 are well tolerated in humans and do not lead to Parkinson's disease. The evidence of a Parkinsonian phenotype in these conditional knockout mice is limited and should be considered preliminary.</p>

In the revised manuscript, the new data around the characterization of the germline-deleted LRRK1 and LRRK2 mice add confidence that LRRK1 and LRRK2 can be deleted using the genetic approach. They have also added new text to the discussion to try and address some of the comments and questions raised regarding how LRRK1/2 loss may impact cell survival and the implications of this work for PD-linked variants in LRRK2 and therapeutic approaches targeting LRRK2.

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the previous reviews.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Public Reviews:</bold></p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Kang, Huang, and colleagues have provided new data to address concerns regarding confirmation of LRRK1 and LRRK2 deletion in their mouse model and the functional impact of the modest loss of TH+ neurons observed in the substantia nigra of their double KO mice. In the revised manuscript, the new data around the characterization of the germline-deleted LRRK1 and LRRK2 mice add confidence that LRRK1 and LRRK2 can be deleted using the genetic approach. They have also added new text to the discussion to try and address some of the comments and questions raised regarding how LRRK1/2 loss may impact cell survival and the implications of this work for PD-linked variants in LRRK2 and therapeutic approaches targeting LRRK2.</p>
<p>The new data provides additional support for the author's claims. I have provided below some suggestions for clarification/additions to the text that can be addressed without additional experiments.</p>
<p>(1) The authors added additional text highlighting that more studies are warranted in mice where LRRK1/2 are deleted in other CNS cell types (microglia/astrocytes) to understand cell extrinsic drivers of the autophagy deficits observed in their previous work. It still remains unclear how loss of LRRK1/2 leads to increased apoptosis and gliosis in dopaminergic neurons in a cell-intrinsic manner, and, as suggested in the original review, it would be helpful to add some text to the discussion speculating on potential mechanisms by which this might occur.</p>
<p>(2) Revisions have been made to the discussion to clarify their rationale around how variants in LRRK2 associated with PD may be loss-of-function to support the relevance of this mouse model to phenotypes observed in PD. However, as written, the argument that PD-linked variants are loss-offunction is based on the fact that the double KO mice have a mild loss of TH+ neurons while the transgenic mice overexpressing PD-linked LRRK2 variants often do not and that early characterization of kinase activity was done in vitro are relatively weak. Given that the majority of evidence generated by many labs in the field supports a gain-of-function mechanism, the discussion should be further tempered to better highlight the uncertainty around this (rather than strongly arguing for a loss-offunction effect). This could include the mention of increased Rab phosphorylation observed in cellular and animal models and opposing consequences on lysosomal function observed in cellular studies in KO and pathogenic variant expressing cells. Further, a reference to the Whiffen et al. 2020 paper mentioned by another reviewer should be included in the discussion for completeness.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for the comments. The discussion has been further revised and expanded to explain the cell extrinsic microglial response to pathophysiological changes in DA neurons of cDKO mice and propose future studies of single-cell RNA-sequencing to identify molecular changes within DA neurons of cDKO mice that may drive their apoptotic death during aging.</p>
<p>We also added paragraphs summarizing existing experimental evidence for the toxic gain-of-function mechanism (biochemical data of increased kinase activity but the lack of evidence for the elevated pRabs and the altered pLRRK2 driving dopaminergic neurodegeneration) and for the loss-of-function mechanism (genetic data of relevant physiological roles) as well as the relationships between LRRK1 and LRRK2 (functional homologues sharing functional domains and overlapping roles in dopaminergic neuron survival) and how dominantly inherited missense mutations can confer a loss of function mechanism (impairing its function in cis and inhibiting wild-type protein function in trans). We also provided a brief summary and discussion of the Whiffen et al. 2020 paper.</p>
