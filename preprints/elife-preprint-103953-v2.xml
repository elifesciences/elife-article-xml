<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Trastuzumab resistance remains a challenge for HER2 positive breast cancer treatment. Targeting metabolic reprogramming would provide novel insights for therapeutic strategies. Here, we integrated metabolomics, transcriptomics and epigenomics data of trastuzumab sensitive and primary resistant HER2 positive breast cancer to identify metabolic alterations. Aberrant cysteine metabolism was discovered in trastuzumab primary resistant breast cancer at both circulating and intracellular levels. The inhibition of SLC7A11 and cysteine starvation could synergize with trastuzumab to induce ferroptosis. Mechanistically, increased H3K4me3 and decreased DNA methylation enhanced SLC7A11 transcription and cystine uptake in trastuzumab resistant breast cancer. The regulation of epigenetic modifications modulated cysteine metabolism and ferroptosis sensitivity. These results revealed an innovative approach for overcoming trastuzumab resistance by targeting specific amino acid metabolism.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Accounting for 15%-20% of all breast cancer cases, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) positive breast cancer has posed great threats to the health of women worldwide(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>). The overexpression of HER2 results in aberrant breast cancer cell proliferation, invasion, and progression(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>). As a monoclonal antibody targeting HER2, trastuzumab has been recognized as the foundational medication in HER2 positive breast cancer treatment and provided remarkable clinical benefits for numerous patients(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>). Around 50% HER2 positive breast cancer patients would experience trastuzumab resistance and disease progression during or after treatment settings(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>). Current theories maintained that trastuzumab resistance mainly resulted from HER2 mutation(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>), antigenic epitope variation(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>), compensatory pathway activation(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>) and tumor heterogeneity(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>). However, there still lacks a comprehensive theory to thoroughly explain the mechanisms behind trastuzumab resistance, and exploring effective targets to overcome resistance remains a major topic in the field of breast cancer research(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>).</p>
<p>Metabolic reprogramming has been acknowledged as one crucial cancer hallmark(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>). Traced back to the first study carried out by Otto Warburg, decades of studies have indicated that glycolysis, tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, lipid metabolism, amino acid metabolism, as well as other processes collectively modulate the development and function of cancer cells and tumor microenvironment (TME) components(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>). Several studies have revealed that different breast cancer subtypes featured diverse metabolic patterns(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>). Targeting specific enzymes or modulating nutrients uptake might normalize the TME and enhance breast cancer treatment efficacy(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>). Yet previous studies often focused on the overall metabolic subtypes of breast cancer, with little attention given to abnormal metabolic changes and underlying genomic alterations induced by specific drug resistance. This might lead to a poor understanding on the tumor heterogeneity in drug resistant breast cancer cells.</p>
<p>Epigenetic modifications play crucial roles in all stages of cancer development and contribute to cancer cell survival selection(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>). Alterations in chromatin structure, DNA methylation and histone modifications provide tumor growth advantage and increase phenotypic variability(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>). During the formation of drug resistance, epigenetic dysregulation modulates key genes transcription associated with treatment tolerance, leading to resistant clonal derivatives and disease progression(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>). Previous studies suggested that COMPASS complex inactivation suppressed tumor suppressor genes transcription and accelerated breast cancer tumorigenesis(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>). Aberrant DNA methylation resulted in abnormal oncogenic signaling activation and drug resistance acquisition(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>). Targeting epigenetic reprogramming might provide novel treatment options for overcoming breast cancer drug resistance.</p>
<p>By integrating metabolomic, transcriptomic and epigenomic data, we identified metabolic alternations, especially cysteine-associated pathways, accompanied with the epigenetic changes during the development of primary trastuzumab resistance of HER2 positive breast cancer (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). Based on these discoveries, targeting certain metabolism-related protein, epigenetic modification or nutrition could all be possible ways to overcome trastuzumab resistance. In all, our study provided novel insights and potential solutions on primary trastuzumab resistance of HER2 positive breast cancer.</p>

<title>Different amino acids metabolic patterns between trastuzumab sensitive and primary resistant HER2 positive breast cancer patients</title>
<p>To investigate metabolic patterns of HER2 positive breast cancer patients with different trastuzumab response, we obtained and analyzed the plasma metabolites data of both trastuzumab sensitive and primary resistant patients (26/26) with good interclass correlations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="supp1">Figure S1A-C</xref>). Of them, 203 metabolites (130 upregulated and 73 downregulated in primary resistant groups) were identified with different abundances among two patient groups (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="supp1">S1D</xref>). KEGG-based pathway analyses suggested the major enrichment in amino acids metabolism. For instance, glycine, serine and threonine metabolism, valine, leucine and isoleucine biosynthesis, as well as cysteine and methionine metabolism were reduced in primary resistant patients; while arginine, proline, alanine, aspartate and glutamate metabolism were enhanced (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1D</xref>).</p>
<p>By comparing the abundance of 20 common protein-construction amino acids, we realized that cystine and aspartate were higher while valine, lysine and leucine were lower in primary resistant groups. However, glutamate kept stable in both groups (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1F</xref>). Non-protein amino acids also displayed difference among these two groups. 2-aminoisobutyric acid and 4-aminobutyric acid (GABA) were lower in resistant groups, while citrulline, kynurenine, ornithine and taurine levels were similar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="supp1">Figure S1E</xref>).</p>
<p>We then analyzed transcriptomic data of pre-treatment breast cancer tumors in I-SPY2 trial(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>) to further explore metabolic gene alterations, in which HER2 positive breast cancer patients received trastuzumab plus paclitaxel, trastuzumab combined with pertuzumab and paclitaxel or T-DM1 plus paclitaxel during neoadjuvant settings. By comparing patients with different responses to neoadjuvant trastuzumab-based regimens (pathological complete response [pCR] and non-pCR), we found 1542 genes upregulated and 1350 genes downregulated in non-pCR groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="supp1">Figure S1F and 1G</xref>). Based on KEGG datasets, amino acids metabolism was found dysregulated in patients with poor responses to trastuzumab, including aberrant lysine degradation, cysteine and methionine metabolism, beta-alanine metabolism and histidine metabolism (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1H</xref>).</p>
<p>As cystine was one of the most significant amino acids in both metabolomic and transcriptomic analyses, we investigated relations between cystine/cysteine metabolic key genes and trastuzumab treatment outcomes. Patients with non-pCR featured higher expression of SLC7A11, while no differences were found in GPX4, GSS and GSR expression (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1I</xref>), indicating SLC7A11 might become a potential target for trastuzumab primary resistant patients.</p>
<p>In general, trastuzumab primary resistant HER2 positive breast cancer patients featured distinct amino acids metabolic patterns, especially increased plasma cystine levels and higher expression of SLC7A11.</p>

<title>Distinct cysteine metabolism in trastuzumab primary resistant HER2 positive breast cancer</title>
<p>To comprehensively compare the metabolic heterogeneity between trastuzumab sensitive and primary resistant HER2 positive breast cancer, we obtained and analyzed both metabolomic and transcriptomic data of trastuzumab sensitive SKBR3 and trastuzumab resistant JIMT1 cell lines.</p>
<p>Significant differences were observed in metabolic data with good quality (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="supp1">Figure S2A and S2B</xref>). Specifically, 181 upregulated and 235 downregulated hydrophilic metabolites accompany 546 upregulated and 412 downregulated lipophilic metabolites were found in JIMT1 cells compared to SKBR3 cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="supp1">S2C</xref>). For hydrophilic metabolites, enrichment analyses revealed that glycine, serine and threonine metabolism were upregulated in JIMT1, while cysteine and methionine metabolism were downregulated (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2C</xref>). Enrichment analyses based on lipophilic metabolites showed that linoleic acid metabolism, fatty transportation and glycerophospholipid catabolism were upregulated in JIMT1, but glycerolipid metabolism, phospholipid biosynthesis and retinoid metabolism downregulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="supp1">Figure S3A and S3B</xref>).</p>

<p>Differential gene expression could also be uncovered from transcriptomic data. 4235 downregulated genes and 4923 upregulated genes were identified in the comparison between JIMT1 and SKBR3 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="supp1">Figure S4A</xref>). Based on KEGG datasets, activities of cysteine and glutathione metabolism pathways were found dysregulated in JIMT1 cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>). More importantly, the joint pathway analyses combining metabolomic and transcriptomic data indicated that JIMT1 featured aberrant glutathione metabolism (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>).</p>
<p>The extracellular cystine is mainly imported by SLC7All for subsequent protein synthesis, glutathione (GSH) production and oxidative catabolism (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>). Both transcriptomic and protein evidence revealed the upregulation of SLC7A11 and glutathione synthetase (GSS) as well as the downregulation of GPX4 and glutathione reductase (GSR) in JIMT1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="supp1">Figure S4B and 2G</xref>), together with the characteristics that JIMT1 cells showed higher cysteine uptake ability and cytoplasmic cysteine level but lower glutathione/glutathione disulfide (GSH/GSSG) ratio than SKBR3 cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2H-J</xref>), indicating the probably increased transsulfuration activity and decreased γ-glutamyl-peptides synthesis activity in JIMT1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="supp1">Figure S4C</xref>). These results suggested that HER2 positive breast cancer with primary trastuzumab resistance might prefer to consume more cystine and feature intracellular cysteine metabolic reprogramming, showing high consistency with metabolic characteristics of relevant breast cancer patients and may associate with trastuzumab treatment response.</p>

<title>Stimulate ferroptosis sensitivity of trastuzumab primary resistant HER2 positive breast cancer</title>
<p>Since cysteine metabolism plays key role in maintaining cellular oxidative-reductive balance, disruption of which may turn breast cancer cells into a more sensitive state to oxidative damage, including ferroptosis(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>). We first downregulated the expression of SLC7A11 and GPX4 in JIMT1 by siRNAs, and the lipid peroxidation of ferroptosis was found increased by measuring BODIPY-C11 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3B</xref>). Similar results were also detected in SKBR3(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="supp1">Figure S5A and S5B</xref>). We then detected the sensitivity of JIMT1 and SKBR3 to SLC7A11 inhibitor (erastin) and GPX4 inhibitor (RSL3) and found JIMT1 was more sensitive to these two inhibitors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="supp1">Figure S5C and S5D</xref>). The deprivation of cysteine could suppress the growth of both JIMT1 and SKBR3, but JIMT1 showed more tolerance to this nutrition starvation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="supp1">Figure S5E</xref>).</p>

<p>12 hours treatment of SLC7A11 inhibitor (erastin), GPX4 inhibitor (RSL3) and even cysteine starvation were all able to induce ferroptosis in both JIMT1 and SKBR3 cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3D</xref>). However, JIMT1 cells indicated more rapidly accumulation of lipid peroxidation under the treatment of erastin, which could be detected by both increased BODIPY-C11 and DCFH-DA (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3F</xref>). Compared with SKBR3, JIMT1 cells were also more sensitive to RSL3 but more durable to cysteine starvation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3G</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3H</xref>), which might be explained by its stronger transsulfuration activities and decreased γ-glutamyl-peptides synthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="supp1">Figure S5F</xref>). The utilization of ferroptosis inhibitor Fer-1 could suppress the lipid peroxidation resulted from erastin, RSL3 and cysteine starvation in both JIMT1 and SKBR3, which also indicated the role of cysteine metabolism in modulating HER2 positive breast cancer ferroptosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="supp1">Figure S5G and S5H</xref>).</p>
<p>To understand whether trastuzumab would modulate the ferroptosis sensitivity, we treated JIMT1 cells with trastuzumab for different durations. We found that with a prolonged exposure of trastuzumab for 72 hours, the total amount of SLC7A11 in JIMT1 was decreased (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3I</xref>). Correspondingly, cystine uptake ability was suppressed after trastuzumab treatment for 48 and 72 hours (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3J</xref>). In addition, cells underwent trastuzumab treatment combining with erastin or cysteine starvation could demonstrate stronger lipid peroxidation and enhanced ferroptosis (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3K</xref>).</p>

<p>Of them, trastuzumab plus erastin and trastuzumab plus cysteine starvation could effectively inhibit tumor growth, while cysteine starvation and erastin monotherapy only showed limited effects on tumor progression, demonstrating the better treatment responses of combination strategy (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B, 4C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="supp1">S6A</xref>). In addition, almost no weight differences were observed among all groups during treatment, partially indicating the safety of such cysteine limitation treatment (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>).</p>
<p>The immune cell compositions in tumor and spleen of each group were measured to analyze the immune response induced by different treatment strategies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="supp1">Figure S6B and S6C</xref>). The infiltration of NK cells (CD3-CD45+CD49b+) in tumors was increased only upon the combination of cysteine deprivation and trastuzumab (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>). Nearly no differences were found in tumor infiltrating NK cell activation (NKp46), toxic function (Granzyme B) and maturation status (CD11b, CD27) among all these groups (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F-H</xref>). While similar results were also observed in spleen NK cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="supp1">Figure S6D-G</xref>).</p>
<p>These results suggested a better effect of cysteine starvation than erastin in NK cell recruitment and activation, resulting a more powerful synergy with trastuzumab to increase the abundance of tumor infiltrating NK cells and show better inhibition of trastuzumab primary resistant breast cancer. As the anti-tumor effects of trastuzumab mainly relies on antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) effects mediated by NK cells(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>), this combination therapy might provide more effective approaches for HER2 positive breast cancer treatment.</p>
<p>We then analyzed the biomarkers of cysteine metabolism and cell death pathways in tumor samples of different treatment groups (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4I</xref>). Erastin and cysteine deprivation monotherapy, or combined with trastuzumab, could upregulate SLC7A11 and GPX4 expression, as well as the abundance of MDA and 4-HNE. Ferroptosis might increase endoplasmic reticulum stress and activate p53 upregulated modulator of apoptosis (PUMA)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>). The combination of trastuzumab and erastin or trastuzumab and cysteine starvation might also modify apoptosis sensitivity. Apoptosis biomarker caspase-3 was found increasing in these synergic treatment groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="supp1">Figure S6H</xref>). These results suggested that targeting cysteine metabolism could induce ferroptosis in trastuzumab primary resistant HER2 positive breast cancer and might have a synergic effect with trastuzumab to inhibit breast cancer progression.</p>

<p>We also confirmed that 7048 and 7001 H3K27me3 peaks were enriched in JIMT1 and SKBR3 respectively, mainly enriching at not only promoter regions but also distal intergenic regions, and exons (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="supp1">S7B</xref>) of genes that involve in cell-cell adhesions, axon guidance, postsynaptic transmission, and neuron differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="supp1">Figure S8B</xref>).</p>
<p>Particularly, we uncovered the enrichment of H3K4me3 at the promoter regions of key cysteine transporter gene SLC7A11 in JIMT1 cells compared with SKBR3 cells while H3K27me3 signals were stable (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>), showing the consistency with its high expression in JIMT1 cells.</p>
<p>By inhibiting the expression of ASH2L, one crucial subunit of COMPASS complex(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>), we downregulated not only the overall H3K4me3 level but also the signal at SLC7A11 promoter in JIMT1 cells, and successfully decreased the expression of SLC7A11 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D-F</xref>). Meanwhile, diminished downstream cysteine uptake leaded to increased lipid peroxidation, the key symbol of ferroptosis (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5G</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5H</xref>).</p>
<p>These results suggested that H3K4me3 may play a more important role in modulating SLC7A11 transcription and cysteine metabolism in JIMT1 than H3K27me3. Targeting H3K4me3 could regulate SLC7A11 expression, enhancing lipid peroxidation and inducing ferroptosis.</p>

<p>Across whole genome, CG-DMRs mainly enriched in intron, intergenic regions, and exons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="supp1">Figure S9C</xref>). Differentially methylated genes were related to several biological processes, such as neurotransmitter biosynthesis, postsynaptic transmission, cytoplasmic translation, and ribosomal activities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="supp1">Figure S10A and S10B</xref>).</p>
<p>SLC7A11 is located at chromosome 4q28.3 and we found that, in comparison with SKBR3, the CpG methylation at SLC7A11 promoter region was decreased in JIMT1 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>). To further verify the influence of altered promoter GC-DMR on SLC7A11 gene transcription, CRISPR/Cas9-based genomic editing tool dCas9-DNMT3A together with SLC7A11 specific promoter-targeting sgRNA sets were utilized to successfully increase the 5-mC level at SLC7A11 promoter regions (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>) in JIMT1 cells, which is confirmed by MeDIP-qPCR (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D</xref>). As a result, the expression of SLC7A11 and cysteine uptake were reduced (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6E</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6F</xref>), and the following cellular lipid peroxidation and ferroptosis were stimulated in JIMT1 cells (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6G</xref>).</p>
<p>These results revealed that increased DNA methylation at SLC7A11 promoter regions in JIMT1 might contribute to SLC7A11 overexpression. Precise modulation of 5-mC could suppress cysteine uptake and result in ferroptosis, which might provide novel methods to overcome trastuzumab resistance.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Metabolic heterogeneity has been widely accepted as important characteristics in many cancer types, which are closely associated with cancer progression, distant metastasis, and even drug resistance(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>), while targeting dysregulated metabolism could also be novel therapeutic strategies(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>).</p>
<p>By comparing the metabolomic data of cell lines and blood samples from patients, we realized that widespread metabolic reprogramming particular the alternation of cysteine metabolism was an important feature of primary trastuzumab resistance, extending our understanding of anti-tumor drug resistance (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>Cysteine is a crucial non-essential amino acid and mainly obtained from dietary, protein catabolism and methionine transsulfuration(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>). Due to oxidative extracellular environment, cystine, instead of cysteine, is normally intake by the major transporter SLC7A11 (also known as xCT)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>), which also has important roles in protein synthesis, posttranslational modifications, and redox balance maintenance(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>).</p>
<p>Meanwhile, biosynthesis of GSH by GSS is one important outlet of cellular cysteine, which helps maintaining oxidation-reduction balance and protecting membrane from oxidative damage including ferroptosis with GPX4 and GSR(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>). The downregulation of both GPX4 and GSR and the upregulation of GSS, together with the higher intake of cysteine mediated by raised SLC7A11, could stimulate GSH consumption and GSSG accumulation in JIMT1 cells, resulting in a weaker reductive cytoplasmic environment and higher sensitivity to oxidative damage, including ferroptosis.</p>
<p>As an important rate-limiting metabolite of the GSH biosynthesis, cysteine modulates ferroptosis through the cyst(e)ine/GSH/GPX4 axis(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>). SLC7A11 inhibition, cysteine deprivation or targeting GPX4 have been reported to effectively enhance lipid peroxidation and induce ferroptosis in several cancer types(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>). In our study, JIMT1 was much more sensitive to SLC7A11 and GPX4 inhibition, but tolerable to cysteine starvation, and this might result from increased methionine transsulfuration activity and γ-glutamyl-peptides synthesis, which compensated the deficiency of extracellular cysteine(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>). Whether similar effects could be observed on GSS or GSR also need to be studied.</p>
<p>The inhibition of HER2 could result in impaired redox homeostasis and increased ROS(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>). Tumor cells might adapt to this metabolic stress by activating antioxidant signaling pathways and acquire recurrence and dormancy(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>). Although JIMT1 is resistant to trastuzumab, the extended exposure of trastuzumab was found to decrease SLC7A11 expression. SLC7A11 overexpression and altered cysteine and glutathione metabolism might function as compensating ways for trastuzumab adaptation. The dual inhibition of cysteine metabolism and HER2 also enhanced ferroptosis both in vivo and in vitro. In a similar manner, the inhibition of glutamine metabolism and antioxidant transcription factor NRF2 could also suppress the proliferation of residual breast cancer after HER2 inhibition and restore intracellular GSH metabolism(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>). These results indicated that re-establishing redox homeostasis and modulating antioxidant metabolism might provide novel treatment options for trastuzumab primary resistant HER2 positive breast cancer.</p>
<p>Besides amino acids metabolism, lipid metabolism, especially polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) and relevant phospholipid metabolism, which are also key drivers of ferroptosis(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>), were identified dysregulated in both primary and acquired trastuzumab resistance of HER2 positive breast cancer(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>), demonstrating the possibility that targeting PUFA metabolism to induce ferroptosis might provide novel treatment options for overcoming trastuzumab resistance.</p>
<p>Not limited to cancer cells, altered cellular metabolism and oxidation-reduction balance can also affect activities of immune cells within TME(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>). For example, lipid peroxidation stress might impair NK functions and immune surveillance. Metabolites, such as L-kynurenine, might enhance ferroptosis in NK cells through aryl hydrocarbon receptor and mediate immunosuppressive TME in gastric cancer(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>). Activation of NRF2 related antioxidant pathways could restore NK cell functions and trigger enhanced anti-tumor responses(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref>). And The deprivation of cysteine was reported to promote the metabolic reprogramming of TME and influence T cell immune responses(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref>). We observed that the combination of cysteine starvation and trastuzumab can increase tumor infiltrating NK cells but show limited effects on NK cell development and toxic functions, relevant mechanisms still need to be discussed. In addition, metabolites, cytokines, damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) and other immunomodulatory signals released from cancer cells that undergo ferroptosis could function on immune cells nearby, stimulating or suppressing anti-tumor immune responses(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref>).</p>
<p>The emergence of drug resistance in cancers mainly depends on two scenarios: Darwinian selection and Lamarkian induction(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref>). During the evolution of breast cancer, different subtypes of breast cancer might originate from different development status of mammary stem cells, bipotent progenitors and differentiated cells(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref>). HER2 positive breast cancer was reported to transform from luminal progenitor and mature luminal cells(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref>). The tumorigenesis of trastuzumab primary resistant HER2 positive breast cancer might favor the Darwinian selection, as a small population of pre-existing trastuzumab tolerant cancer cells might be enriched upon treatment.</p>
<p>To investigate genetic and epigenetic issues stimulating the evolution of primary trastuzumab resistant and sensitive breast cancer, we compared genomic variation, histone modification and DNA methylation status among JIMT1, SKBR3 and MCF10A (normal mammary epithelial cell).</p>
<p>During carcinogenesis, missense mutations, splicing mutations and in frame deletions were the most frequent events and MUC3A, MUC6, OR8U1 and ZNF717 were most frequent mutated genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="supp1">Figure S11A and S11B</xref>). Meanwhile, single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) was the major variation type and the substitution between cytosine and thymine was the most common signature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="supp1">Figure S12A-B and S13A-C</xref>).</p>
<p>Compared with MCF10A, JIMT1 instead of SKBR3 featured distinct single nucleotide variation (SNV) at the exon region of SLC7A11 (gain at Chr4:138183261 and loss at Chr4: 138219340) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="supp1">Figure S14A-C</xref>).</p>
<p>SNVs located in exons have been reported to modulate gene transcription and function. For example, SNVs in BRCA1 exons encoding RING and BRCT domains might disrupt BRCA1 expression and function, therefore increasing breast cancer risks(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">73</xref>). While noncoding SNVs, such as rs9383590 located at ESR1 enhancer region, could interact with regulatory elements and activate oncogene transcription(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">74</xref>). The accumulation of SNVs was also associated with driver gene mutations and might promote breast cancer evolution in a cumulative manner(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">75</xref>). Whether different SNVs in SLC7A11 exon regions could contribute to SLC7A11 expression and breast cancer initiation still needs to be studied.</p>
<p>Epigenetic issues also demonstrated their impact on carcinogenesis. H3K4me3 instead of H3K27me3 peaks were shown more enrichment at SLC7A11 promoter regions in MCF10A cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="supp1">Figure S15A and S15B</xref>), while 5-mC levels at CpG islands among SLC7A11 promoter regions were also increased in MCF10A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="supp1">Figure S15C</xref>), revealing the important proposal of histone modifications and DNA methylation on metabolic reprogramming during the evolution of HER2 positive breast cancer.</p>
<p>Although several studies have reported that SLC7A11 expression was modulated by NRF2, ATF4 and other transcription factors(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">76</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">77</xref>), it remains unclear whether its expression is subject to a broader genome-wide or histone-level regulation(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">78</xref>). The theory that epigenetic modifications contribute to specific transcription regulation, cancer cell development and metabolic reprogramming, to modulate treatment response and drug resistance, has been widely accepted and proved(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">79</xref>). Our study tried to explore the relationship between the altered cysteine metabolism signature and epigenetic modifications in trastuzumab resistant HER2 positive breast cancer. Elucidating epigenetic mechanisms would help better understand trastuzumab resistance formation and provide novel therapeutic opportunities.</p>
<p>Several studies have described the regulatory roles of histone modifications on oncogene transcription(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">79</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">80</xref>). MLL mutations were identified among various cancers and widespread shortening H3K4me3 peaks at tumor suppressor genes might contribute to tumor initiation(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">81</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">82</xref>) and H3K27me3 could modulate chemotherapy tolerance in triple negative breast cancer (TNBC)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">83</xref>). Moreover, the combination of chemotherapy and H3K27me3 demethylation inhibitor could prevent the proliferation of persister cells(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">83</xref>). Targeting KDM6A could inhibit JIMT1 tumor growth via decreasing tRNA transcription(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">84</xref>). As we confirmed, reducing H3K4me3 can decrease ASH2L, SLC7A11 expression and cystine uptake, leading to enhanced lipid peroxidation and ferroptosis, modulating histone modification can be a promising strategy in cancer treatment.</p>
<p>Compared with normal tissues, almost all cancers feature abnormal DNA hypomethylation and local hypermethylation at specific CpG islands(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">81</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">85</xref>). Dysregulated DNA methylation contributes to breast cancer tumorigenesis and drug resistance formation(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">86</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">87</xref>). For instance, trastuzumab resistant HER2 positive breast cancer was found associated with downregulated TGFBI, CXCL2 and SLC38A1, which was silenced by DNA hypermethylation(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">88</xref>). Aberrant DNMT1, DNMT3A and DNMT3B expression were correlated with endocrine therapy resistance and predicted worsen pathologic status and prognosis(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">89</xref>). By utilizing CRISPR interference, we verified the effect of 5-mC at SLC7A11 promoter on gene expression and downstream cysteine metabolism. What’s more, since increased H3K4me3 might interact with DNMT3A-DNMT3L(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">90</xref>), the crosstalk between histone modification and DNA methylation may have collaborative effects on cysteine metabolism in trastuzumab primary resistant breast cancer.</p>
<p>In conclusion, our study revealed that trastuzumab primary resistant HER2 positive breast cancer featured distinct cysteine metabolism, which was driven by altered H3K4me3 and DNA methylation. Targeting cysteine metabolism could provide novel treatment concepts for overcoming trastuzumab resistance.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Hua et al show how targeting amino acid metabolism can overcome Trastuzumab resistance in HER2+ breast cancer.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors used metabolomics, transcriptomics and epigenomics approaches in vitro and in preclinical models to demonstrate how trastuzumab resistant cells utilize cysteine metabolism.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>However, there are some key aspects that needs to be addressed.</p>
<p>Major:</p>
<p>(1) Patient Samples for Transcriptomic Analysis: It is unclear from the text whether tumor tissues or blood samples were used for the transcriptomic analysis. This distinction is crucial, as these two sample types would yield vastly different inferences. The authors should clarify the source of these samples.</p>
<p>(2) The study only tested one trastuzumab-resistant and one trastuzumab-sensitive cell lines. It is unclear whether these findings are applicable to other HER2-positive tumor cell lines, such as HCC1954. The authors should validate their results in additional cell lines to strengthen their conclusions.</p>
<p>(3) Relevance to Metastatic Disease: Trastuzumab resistance often arises in patients during disease recurrence, which is frequently associated with metastasis. However, the mouse experiments described in this paper were conducted only in the primary tumors. This article will have more impact if the authors could demonstrate that the combination of Erastin or cysteine starvation with trastuzumab can also improve outcomes in metastasis models.</p>
<p>Minor:</p>
<p>(1) The figures lack information about the specific statistical tests used. Including this information is essential to show the robustness of the results.</p>
<p>(2) Figure 3K Interpretation: The significance asterisks in Figure 3K do not specify the comparison being made. Are they relative to the DMSO control? This should be clarified.</p>
<p>Comments on revisions:</p>
<p>While the authors acknowledge the limitation of using only a single trastuzumab resistant/sensitive pair, simply stating that additional cell lines will be tested in future work is simply inadequate. The biological heterogeneity of HER2-positive breast cancer demands validation in at least one independent resistant model (e.g., HCC1954 or BT 474R) alongside its parental counterpart. Without demonstrating that SLC7A11 upregulation, cysteine dependency, and sensitivity to Erastin plus trastuzumab extend beyond the original cell line pair, the generalizability and translational relevance of the findings remain uncertain. The authors need to perform and report key functional results (cell viability, apoptosis, and SLC7A11 expression) in an additional resistant and sensitive HER2-positive cell line before this manuscript can be considered robust.</p>

<p>In this manuscript, Hua et al. proposed SLC7A11, a protein facilitating cellular cystine uptake, as a potential target for the treatment of trastuzumab resistant HER2 positive breast cancer. If this claim holds true, the finding would be of significance and might be translated to clinical practice. Nevertheless, this reviewer finds that the conclusion was insufficiently supported by the data.</p>
<p>Notably, most of the data (Figures 2-6) were based on two cell lines - JIMT1 as a representative of trastuzumab resistant cell line, and SKBR3 as a representative of trastuzumab sensitive cell line. As such, these findings could be cell line specific while irrelevant to trastuzumab sensitivity at all. Furthermore, the authors' claim of ferroptosis induction is primarily based on lipid peroxidation assays (Figure 3). The rescuing effects of ferroptosis inhibitors on cell viability were missing. The xenograft experiments were also suspicious (Figure 4). Systemic cysteine starvation is known to cause adverse effects, including liver necrosis, and the compound (i.e., erastin) used by the authors is not suitable for in vivo experiments due to low solubility and low metabolic stability. Finally, the authors focus on epigenetic regulations (Figures 5 &amp; 6) without first investigating well-established transcription factors, such as NRF2 and ATF4, which are known to regulate SLC7A11.</p>
<p>To sum up, this reviewer finds that the most valuable data in this manuscript is perhaps Figure 1, which provides unbiased information concerning the metabolic patterns in trastuzumab sensitive and primary resistant HER2 positive breast cancer patients.</p>
<p>Comments on revisions:</p>
<p>(1) Figure 3: The unit of concentration should be &quot;μM&quot;. &quot;μm&quot; means micrometer.</p>
<p>(2) Figure S5: Ferroptosis inhibitors should be used in cell viability assays to exclude the off-target effect of RSL3 and erastin. Note that erastin also targets VDAC, while RSL3 may inhibit other selenoproteins at high concentrations. Cell viability assays are critical for demonstrating ferroptosis and should be included in the main figure rather than relegated to the supplemental materials.</p>
<p>(3) Figure 4B &amp; 4C: the data of &quot;H&quot; group and &quot;Erastin&quot; group are inconsistent. In panel B, the tumor size in the &quot;H&quot; group appears smaller than in the &quot;Erastin&quot; group, while in panel C, the opposite trend is observed.</p>
<p>(4) The catalog numbers for the cystine/cysteine-deficient DMEM (from BIOTREE) and diet (from Xietong Bio) should be provided. This information is essential for readers to identify and verify the specific products used in the study.</p>

<p>Thank you for your valuable comments. In the transcriptomic analysis, we included the data of HER2 positive breast cancer patients who received trastuzumab in I-SPY2 trial (GSE181574). Tumor tissues were used in this dataset. We highlighted the usage of “pre-treatment breast cancer tumors” in Line 309 and included the overview of transcriptomic data analysis in I-SPY2 trial in Figure S1F.</p>

<p>Thank you for your valuable comments. We agree with your opinion, and the exploration of multiple cell lines would make our research findings more comprehensive. This is a limitation of our study, and we would continue to improve our design and methods in future experiments.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your valuable comments. We have modified this figure to demonstrate it more clearly. In Figure 3K, the significance was determined by one-way ANOVA and the comparison presented was relative to the DMSO control. It was indicated that the combination of erastin or cysteine starvation and trastuzumab could increase lipid peroxidation, although trastuzumab monotherapy did not induce ferroptosis.</p>
<p>Additionally, the combination of erastin and trastuzumab could result in more lipid peroxidation than erastin alone. Similar results were also found in the combination of cysteine starvation and trastuzumab. These results showed that targeting cysteine metabolism plus trastuzumab could have synergic effects to induce ferroptosis in trastuzumab resistant HER2 positive breast cancer.</p>

Cell viability was not determined, and the rescuing effects of ferroptosis inhibitors were missing. The xenograft experiments were also suspicious (Figure 4). The description of how cysteine starvation was performed on xenograft tumors was lacking, and the compound (i.e., erastin) used by the authors is not suitable for in vivo experiments due to low solubility and low metabolic stability. Finally, it is confusing why the authors focused on epigenetic regulations (Figures 5 &amp; 6), without measuring major transcription factors (e.g., NRF2, ATF4) which are known to regulate SLC7A11.</p>
<p>To sum up, this reviewer finds that the most valuable data in this manuscript is perhaps Figure 1, which provides unbiased information concerning the metabolic patterns in trastuzumab-sensitive and primary resistant HER2-positive breast cancer patients.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your valuable comments. We agree with your suggestions. Your feedback would help enhance the quality of our research.</p>
<p>(1) Our research was mainly conducted in JIMT1 (trastuzumab resistant) and SKBR3 (trastuzumab sensitive), and this is a limitation of our study. The experimental validation using different cell lines will make our research findings more persuasive. In our future research, we will continuously optimize experimental design and methods to make our findings more comprehensive.</p>
<p>(2) The detection of ferroptosis in our research was mainly performed by evaluating the lipid peroxidation. Experiments measuring cell viability and rescuing effects would help provide more evidence.</p>
<p>We utilized CCK8 tests to compare cell viabilities of JIMT1 and SKBR3 in different erastin and RSL3 concentrations, as well as different exposure time of cysteine starvation. It was shown that JIMT1 was more sensitive to erastin and RSL3, but tolerant to cysteine starvation, which was consistent with the previous lipid peroxidation tests. This data was included in Figure S5C-E. We added the description in Line 375-379.</p>
<p>In addition, we also performed experiments to explore the rescuing effects of ferroptosis inhibitor Fer-1. It was indicated that Fer-1 could suppress the lipid peroxidation resulted from erastin, RSL3 and cysteine starvation in both JIMT1 and SKBR3. This provided more evidence that cysteine metabolism played a vital role in modulating HER2 positive breast cancer ferroptosis. This data was included in Figure S5G and S5H. We added the description to Line 387-391.</p>
<p>(3) In xenograft experiments, the cysteine starvation was performed by feeding cystine/cysteine-deficient diet (Xietong Bio). We added details of this diet on Line 236-237 in Methods.</p>
<p>We agree with your opinion on the role of erastin in experiments in vivo. We have tried to optimize drug dissolution and other conditions by referring to previous relevant literature. We would continue to improve our experimental design and methods.</p>
<p>(4) Epigenetic modifications have been recognized as crucial factors in drug resistance formation. An increasing number of studies have emphasized the importance of epigenetic changes in regulating the abnormal expression of oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes related to drug resistance. Currently, the role of epigenetic changes in the development of trastuzumab resistance in HER2 positive breast cancer is still in exploration. We tried to investigate the dysregulation of histone modifications and DNA methylation in trastuzumab resistant HER2 positive breast cancer. Our findings indicated that targeting H3K4me3 and DNA methylation could decrease SLC7A11 expression and induce ferroptosis. This would provide more evidence in exploring trastuzumab resistance mechanisms. We have provided a detailed discussion on Line 598-607.</p>
<p>We would like to extend our appreciation for your constructive suggestions and continue to improve our research in future experiments.</p>
