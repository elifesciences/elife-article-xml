<title>Abstract</title><p>Myeloid leukemias, diseases marked by aggressiveness and poor outcomes, are frequently triggered by oncogenic translocations. In the case of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) the BCR-ABL fusion initiates chronic phase disease with second hits allowing progression to blast crisis. Although Gleevec has been transformative for CML, blast crisis CML remains relatively drug resistant. Here we show that MSI2-HOXA9, a translocation with an unknown role in cancer, can serve as a second hit in driving bcCML. Compared to BCR-ABL, BCR-ABL/MSI2-HOXA9 led to a more aggressive disease <italic>in vivo</italic> with decreased latency, increased lethality and a differentiation blockade that is a hallmark of blast crisis. Domain mapping revealed that the MSI2 RNA binding domain RRM1 had a preferential impact on growth and lethality of bcCML relative to RRM2 or the HOXA9 domain. Mechanistically, MSI2-HOXA9 triggered global downstream changes with a preferential upregulation of mitochondrial components. Consistent with this, BCR-ABL/MSI2-HOXA9 cells exhibited a significant increase in mitochondrial respiration. These data suggest that MSI2-HOXA9 acts, at least in part, by increasing expression of the mitochondrial polymerase Polrmt and augmenting mitochondrial function and basal respiration in blast crisis. Collectively, our findings demonstrate for the first time that translocations involving the stem and developmental signal MSI2 can be oncogenic, and suggest that MSI, which we found to be a frequent partner for an array of translocations, could also be a driver mutation across solid cancers.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Myeloid leukemias are a heterogeneous group of cancers, many of which have limited treatment options and are associated with poor prognosis. Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is characterized by the accumulation of myeloid precursors and mature myeloid cells and is driven by translocations between the BCR serine/threonine kinase gene and the ABL tyrosine kinase, resulting in a constitutively active ABL tyrosine kinase. Although imatinib mesylate effectively blocks the activity of the BCR-ABL kinase and has been used to treat CML, it is not curative because the cancer stem cells that propagate CML are no longer addicted to kinase signaling and are thus resistant to therapy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. Progression from CML to blast crisis CML (bcCML) occurs with acquisition of an additional oncogenic hit; this event is associated with a rapid expansion of immature blast cells and a concomitant increase in imatinib resistance such that only 50% of patients are responsive to therapy. The specific secondary translocations and mutations that have been reported in bcCML include activation of oncogenes such as RAS and MYC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>, translocations such as NUP98-HOXA9, and mutations in tumor suppressors such as RB1, TP53, and CDKN2A<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>. Although multiple mutations are seen in bcCML, the only mouse model of bcCML that exists was created with a combination of BCR-ABL and the NUP98/HOXA9 gene fusion (associated with t(7;11)(p15;p15)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>A new translocation between the cell fate determinant Musashi2 (MSI2) and HOXA9 was reported several years ago as a novel genetic lesion present in bcCML patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>. In this study, 33 CML accelerated phase/blast crisis patient samples were used for a multicolor FISH study. Among this group, 2 cases harbored a translocation, t(7;17)(p15;q23), resulting in a <italic>MSI2/HOXA9</italic> fusion gene. This in-frame fusion transcript retained both MSI2 RNA recognition domains and the HOXA9 homeobox domain, raising the potential for previously uncharacterized roles in CML progression. This translocation was of particular interest because it was the first reported mutation involving MSI. The MSI family of RNA binding proteins is comprised of two members, MSI1 and MSI2, each containing two RNA recognition motifs (RRMs) separated by a short linker region in the N-terminal half of the protein<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>. Functionally, MSI can either suppress translation by sequestering poly-A binding protein (PABP) or activate translation by stabilizing the RNA and recruiting the poly (A) polymerase GLD2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup> after binding to consensus sequences in the 3’ untranslated region (3’ UTR) of mRNA. Together, these activities result in modulation of a diverse set of genes that regulate stem and progenitor cell growth in multiple tissues including Numb, an antagonist of Notch signaling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. Msi2 overexpression led to elevation of the self-renewal genes <italic>HoxA9</italic> and <italic>HoxA10</italic>, the Sonic hedgehog and Notch signaling components <italic>Gli1</italic> and <italic>Hes1,</italic> and <italic>Cyclin D1</italic> and <italic>Cdk2</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. In addition to its role in normal development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>, MSI proteins have emerged as critical mediators and dependencies of both solid cancers and hematologic malignancies. In pancreatic cancer, loss of MSI2 has been shown to lead to a defect in progression from PanIN to adenocarcinoma<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>, exerting its impact through powerful oncogenes such as c-met and epigenetic regulators such as Brd4 and Hmgb2. In colon adenomas driven by APC loss of function mutations, MSI2 acts as an inhibitor of known tumor suppressors including Lrig1, Bmpr1a, Cdkn1a, and Pten and sustained activation of mTORC1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. In context of hematologic malignancies, MSI2 is required for the development and progression of myeloid leukemias<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. The loss of MSI2 reduced cancer stem cell frequency, increased differentiation, and impaired propagation of bcCML in mouse models <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. Further, overexpression of an MSI2 transgene in bone marrow cells expressing BCR-ABL led to increased tumor burden<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. MSI2 is also highly upregulated during human CML progression, and its expression serves as an early indicator of poor prognosis not only in leukemias but also in solid cancers like lung cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. However, while these studies have collectively identified MSI genes as clear dependencies in cancers and have highlighted their potential utility as a prognostic, whether naturally occurring MSI translocations and mutations can serve as oncogenes in driving cancer growth remains unknown.</p>
<p>Here we have used the MSI2-HOXA9 fusion gene to show that this translocation, found in patients with bcCML, can cooperate with BCR-ABL to drive progression to bcCML, demonstrating for the first time that the MSI gene alterations that occur in patients can serve as oncogenes. Further, the MSI2 RNA recognition motifs (RRMs) were essential to the oncogenicity of this translocation and they act to control bcCML by enhancing mitochondrial energetics. Deletion of the RRM1 abrogated the enhanced cell growth conferred by the MSI2-HOXA9 fusion <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. Additionally, the MSI2-HOXA9 fusion resulted in cells that showed a rise in maximum mitochondrial respiration rate likely due to the concomitant increase in the mitochondrial polymerase, Polrmt, whose elevated expression may be driven by the abnormal localization of MSI2-HOXA9 to the cell nucleus. In all, these data demonstrate a novel MSI2-translocation driven downstream event that leads to a more energetic, differentiation arrested aggressive state thus triggering CML progression to bcCML.</p>

<title>MSI2-HOXA9 confers a growth advantage and arrests differentiation</title>
<p>To test the oncogenic activity of the MSI2-HOXA9 fusion, we generated an MSI2-HOXA9 gene reflecting the breakpoint reported in CML patients (t(7:17)(p15;q23)). Specifically, we fused the amino terminus of MSI2 (containing both RNA binding domains (RRMs)) with the carboxyl terminus of the HOXA9 protein (containing the homeobox domain) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). We infected murine hematopoietic stem/progenitor (ckit+, Lineage-, Sca1+ (KLS)) cells with viruses encoding BCR-ABL together with either MSI2-HOXA9 or an empty vector and tested their colony forming ability (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>). Compared to BCR-ABL and empty vector (hereafter referred to as just BCR-ABL), the combination of BCR-ABL and MSI2-HOXA9 infected cells exhibited significantly increased colony formation in primary (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>) and secondary plating (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>).</p>

<p>To test whether the MSI2-HOXA9 fusion confers a growth advantage <italic>in vivo</italic>, we transplanted hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells infected with BCR-ABL and MSI2-HOXA9 or an empty vector into lethally irradiated recipient mice and monitored disease development over time (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>). Animals transplanted with cells harboring both BCR-ABL and MSI2-HOXA9 exhibited far more aggressive disease with a ~3-fold increase in chimerism relative to the cohort receiving cells carrying BCR-ABL alone (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>). To determine whether disease observed with BCR-ABL and MSI2-HOXA9 was more aggressive because it was more undifferentiated than disease driven by BCR-ABL alone, we compared the BCR-ABL/MSI2-HOXA9 leukemic cells to the previously established model of blast crisis CML driven by BCR-ABL/NUP98-HOXA9 (Dash et al. 2002). To this end, we transplanted mice with KLS cells infected with either BCR-ABL, BCR-ABL/NUP98-HOXA9, or BCR-ABL/MSI2-HOXA9 and sorted Lin-leukemia cells from these mice. Even though Lin-cells were compared, which are generally more undifferentiated, based on Giemsa staining BCR-ABL/MSI2-HOXA9 cells displayed an increase in less differentiated blasts (82% vs. 61%) and a concomitant decrease in more differentiated cells compared to BCR-ABL-driven disease and, in this regard, was most consistent with the previously described bcCML model (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F-I</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">Fig. S1A-C</xref>). Additionally, by FACS total Lin-content was also increased in BCR-ABL/MSI2-HOXA9 relative to BCR-ABL alone (57% vs. 16%, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">Fig. S1D</xref>). The change in differentiation state driven by MSI2-HOXA9 cells suggested that when coupled with BCR-ABL, MSI2-HOXA9 can drive chronic phase CML to blast crisis, and thus serve as an oncogene.</p>
<p>Reflecting the development of this more aggressive disease, mice transplanted with BCR-ABL/MSI2-HOXA9 infected cells displayed significantly reduced survival. Thus, while the median survival of mice carrying BCR-ABL alone was 37 days, that of the BCR-ABL/MSI2-HOXA9 group was just 18 days, an 8-fold increase in the risk of death (HR=0.11) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1J</xref>). Collectively, these findings indicate that the MSI2/HOXA9 fusion protein has oncogenic activity and can cooperate with BCR-ABL to drive cancer progression.</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<title>MSI2 RNA binding domains play a key role in BCR-ABL/MSI2-HOXA9-driven oncogenesis</title>
<p>Given that MSI2 and HOXA9 both play key roles in regulation of gene expression – MSI2 as an RNA binding protein and HOXA9 as a homeodomain transcription factor – we tested whether the oncogenic ability of MSI2-HOXA9 was dependent on the RNA binding domains of MSI2 (RRM1 and RRM2) or on the DNA binding domain (DBD) of HOXA9. We generated MSI2-HOXA9 domain mutants lacking either RRM1 or RRM2 as well as a truncated mutant lacking the HOXA9 DNA binding domain (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). To test whether the domain mutants would blunt the growth advantage provided by MSI2-HOXA9 in the presence of BCR-ABL, we infected KLS cells with viruses encoding BCR-ABL and either full length MSI2-HOXA9 or the domain mutants and performed colony assays. The loss of either RRM1 or RRM2 led to a significant loss in colony forming ability compared to cells infected with BCR-ABL/MSI2-HOXA9 (&gt;2-fold for both ΔRRM1 and ΔRRM2), indicating that each RNA binding domain was required for MSI2-HOXA9 activity (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>). While loss of the HOXA9 domain did not significantly impact primary colony formation, some impact (1.7-fold reduction) was seen at secondary plating (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">Fig. S1E</xref>). These data suggest that the domains could be differentially important, with the RRMs having a dominant impact on bcCML growth. Consistent with the impact on growth <italic>in vitro</italic>, transplantation of BCR-ABL/ΔRRM1 blunted leukemic growth <italic>in vivo</italic> while loss of the HOXA9 portion of the MSI2-HOXA9 fusion did not impact chimerism compared to BCR-ABL/MSI2-HOXA9 (~30% for MSI2-HOXA9, ~25% for ΔHOXA9, ~7% for ΔRRM1; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref> and compare to <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>). Although each RRM was necessary for bcCML growth, expression of full length wild-type MSI2 did not impart any growth advantage when combined with BCR-ABL in either primary (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>) or secondary colony assays (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref>) relative to BCR-ABL alone. The fact that the 5’ portion of MSI2 but not the full-length protein is oncogenic suggests that the 3’ end may regulate or mask MSI2 oncogenic activity, consistent with the highly regulated activity of wild type MSI2 proteins during development and in stem cell maintenance. Whether this regulatory effect is due to altered binding activity resulting from a change in MSI2 protein conformation, a shift in cellular localization relative to wild type MSI2, or through some other mechanism is not clear and represents an important question for future study.</p>

Analysis of established primary cancer cells stained with Giemsa and May-Grunwald stains indicated that while both RRM1 and RRM2 similarly impacted growth in colony assays (78 colonies for MSI2-HOXA9, ~35 colonies for both ΔRRM1 and ΔRRM2; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">Fig. S1E</xref>), only deletion of RRM1 impacted differentiation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2F-I</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">Fig. S1F-H</xref>), leading to a reduction in blast cell counts (~80% for MSI2-HOXA9, 60% for BCR-ABL only, 58% for ΔRRM1; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2F</xref>) and an increase in differentiated myeloid cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2G-I</xref>), and resulting in a disease similar in composition to that driven by BCR-ABL alone.</p>
<p>Between the two MSI2 RRMs, the data above suggested that RRM1 is more critical than RRM2. This is consistent with RRM1 having been shown to provide most of the specificity and higher binding energy relative to RRM2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>, and thus we focused on RRM1 deletion for subsequent <italic>in vivo</italic> investigation. Further, supporting the observation that the MSI2 RRM1 is critical for growth and differentiation, the deletion of RRM1 led to significantly longer survival that was no different from the survival of mice transplanted with BCR-ABL alone (P=0.97) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2J</xref>). Thus, while the median survival of mice with leukemia driven by BCR-ABL/ΔHOXA9 was 26 days, the loss of RRM1 (BCR-ABL/ΔRRM1) was 46 days, similar to BCR-ABL alone (43.5 days). This resulted in a 12-fold (HR=0.08) increase in risk of death for BCR-ABL/ΔHOXA9 compared to BCR-ABL only and a 15-fold (HE=0.06) increase in risk of death for BCR-ABL/ΔHOXA9 compared to BCR-ABL/ΔRRM1. Together, these results demonstrate that the MSI2 RRM1 is critical for the lethality seen in BCR-ABL/MSI2-HOXA9 bcCML.</p>

<title>MSI2-HOXA9-triggers global changes in transcriptional programs</title>
<p>To understand how the MSI2-HOXA9 translocation promotes bcCML, we compared gene expression patterns in BCR-ABL and BCR-ABL/MSI2-HOXA9-driven disease.

<p>Among the genes most enriched in BCR-ABL/MSI2-HOXA9-driven bcCML were key components of the mitochondrial respiratory chain, including Complex I, Complex III, Complex IV and the F0 subunit of ATP synthase (mt-Atp6 and mt-Atp8). Analysis of metabolic capacity and mitochondrial function on Lin-bcCML using the Seahorse Cell Mito Stress Test (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>) revealed that MSI2-HOXA9 significantly increased basal respiration (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B, C</xref>), ATP production (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref>), and maximal respiration (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E</xref>). These three findings suggest that introduction of MSI2-HOXA9 results in a cell operating at a higher energetic level. In contrast, most of the other mitochondrial parameters we evaluated were not significantly impacted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS2">Fig. S2B-E</xref>). Further, BCR-ABL/MSI2-HOXA9 increased basal glycolysis (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4F, G</xref>), glycolytic reserves (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4H</xref>), and maximum glycolysis (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4I</xref>).

<title>MSI2-HOXA9 impacts mitochondrial gene expression through control of the mitochondrial polymerase, Polrmt</title>
<p>To understand the basis of the alteration in mitochondrial gene expression in BCR-ABL/MSI2-HOXA9 leukemia and the concomitant increase in energy production, we tested whether MSI2-HOXA9 impacted mitochondrial gene expression directly in the mitochondria or indirectly through control of the polymerase and/or transcription factors. We thus assessed expression of the mitochondrial polymerase and selected mitochondrial transcription factors and found a 5-fold increase in expression of the lone mitochondrial polymerase (Polrmt) in BCR-ABL/MSI2-HOXA9 cells as well as significant increases in the transcription initiation factor Tfb2m and the mitochondrial transcription factor regulator Nrf1, 1.5-fold and 1.4-fold, respectively (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>). While Tfb2m and Nrf showed a significant increase in expression, we chose to focus on the much greater impact seen on Polrmt expression. Since these components are transcribed in the nucleus, the data suggest that MSI2-HOXA9 controls mitochondrial gene expression by promoting expression of Polrmt and key transcription factors. Consistent with this, MSI2-HOXA9 was preferentially found in the nucleus relative to MSI2 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B-D</xref>). Further, we identified 10 occurrences of the minimal MSI2 RRM1 consensus binding sequence UAGU within the Polmrt transcript. These data suggest a model in which MSI2-HOXA9 localizes to the nucleus and elevates Polrmt expression. Polrmt and the mitochondrial transcription factors in turn control expression of mitochondrial genes that encode the components of the respiratory chain, leading to increased mitochondrial function and cellular energetics that drive the aggressiveness of bcCML (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5E</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The stem cell gene MSI2 is often hijacked and aberrantly upregulated in cancer, where it can drive sustained self-renewal of cancer stem cells, leading to tumor growth, therapy resistance, and disease progression. Although MSI2 was shown to be a dependency of aggressive myeloid leukemias as well as solid cancers such as pancreatic cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>, and its transgenic overexpression can lead to increased tumor burden<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>, whether MSI2 translocations or mutations harbored in patients can serve as oncogenes and driver mutations was unknown. Because a translocation between MSI2 and HOXA9 had been reported to occur in blast crisis CML patients, we focused on testing whether this translocation could be an oncogene in myeloid leukemia. Our data presented here show that overexpression of the MSI2-HOXA9 allele together with BCR-ABL can trigger the development of blast crisis CML. These findings are important in that they represent the first demonstration that an aberrant MSI2 genetic lesion found in patients can be oncogenic.</p>
<p>The new bcCML mouse model we developed is a valuable resource to the field, particularly because there is only one other model for bcCML<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup> developed over 20 years ago. bcCML is an aggressive, highly lethal malignancy, and new models are critical to better understand the biology of the disease, identify molecular dependencies, and test new approaches to therapy. The MSI2-HOXA9/BCR-ABL mouse model is characterized by a shift in cellular composition during disease progression, with an increase in blast cells and a decrease in more differentiated blood cells. This is consistent with the human disease as well as with the existing NUP98-HOXA9/BCR-ABL mouse model. Importantly, comparison of MSI2-HOXA9 and NUP98-HOXA9-driven leukemias may reveal activation of shared as well as unique programs. Analysis in each case is valuable: identification of common pathways activated in the two models may reveal underlying programs that are fundamental to blast crisis CML growth, regardless of driver gene, while identification of unique pathways may provide key insight into mechanisms of initiation and identify oncogene-specific dependencies. Overall, the MSI2-HOXA9 leukemia model we developed will contribute to a deeper understanding of how a benign, chronic disease transitions to an aggressive, highly lethal disease, and may reveal new vulnerabilities that can be targeted to stop this deadly progression.</p>
<p>Domain mutants of the MSI2-HOXA9 protein allowed us to better delineate the contributions of the two RRM domains and the DBD domain of HOXA9. Deletion of the MSI2 RRM1 reduced the oncogenicity of the MSI2-HOXA9 fusion <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>, resulting in a disease similar to BCR-ABL alone as chimerism and survival were similar to the CML model. RRM1 deletion prevented the increase in blast cells that the full fusion produced and resulted in a composition of differentiated cells and blasts similar to BCR-ABL. While the loss of the HOXA9 portion of the MSI2-HOXA9 had some impact in secondary plating <italic>in vitro</italic>, loss of the DBD did not impact survival and progression of bcCML <italic>in vivo</italic>. These data identify the RRM1 domain of the new allele as the predominant driver of MSI-HOXA9’s oncogenic capacity.</p>
<p>To understand the downstream mechanism by which MSI2-HOXA9 cooperated with BCR-ABL to drive CML into blast crisis, we analyzed the transcriptomic changes triggered by MSI2-HOXA9 in the context of BCR-ABL expression. Among the global changes in gene expression patterns observed, the most highly enriched factors were developmental and stem cell signals such Aldh1a1, Erbb3, and Kit, consistent with the undifferentiated nature of blast crisis CML that was driven by MSI2-HOXA9. In addition, there was a striking increase in the expression of mitochondrial genes, with many critical components of the respiratory chain significantly elevated. This translated to increased mitochondrial activity as well as an increase in basal respiration and cellular energetics. Among the genes regulated through MSI2-HOXA9 activity was Polrmt, the sole RNA polymerase that controls mitochondrial gene expression. Our data suggest that dysregulated Polrmt activity upregulates the expression of key respiratory chain proteins, increasing mitochondrial function and helping to fuel uncontrolled growth of the leukemia. While the increased mitochondrial energetics may be related to the increased proliferation that is also a hallmark of bcCML, several studies have suggested a link between mitochondrial activity and leukemia cell differentiation as well. For example, Yehudai et al showed that blocking mitochondrial DNA replication using either genetic knockdown or chemical inhibitors promotes the differentiation of human AML cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>. Further, in a study examining the relationship between microvesicle-driven release of mitochondria, energy metabolism, and leukemia cell differentiation, Zhao et al showed that disrupting the release of mitochondria or blocking mitochondrial function significantly impacts the differentiation of human leukemia cell lines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>. The possibility that a fundamental relationship exists between mitochondrial pathways and the differentiation state of aggressive leukemias is exciting and may reveal new strategies for therapy. The contribution of mitochondrial activity to proliferation versus differentiation will be an important question to address in future work.</p>
<p>While the main focus of the work reported here is the role of MSI2 translocation in hematologic malignancies, this discovery may lay a foundation for defining the role MSI2 genetic lesions may play as oncogenes in other disease settings. Not only have other MSI2 fusions been detected in patient leukemia samples (i.e., PAX5-MSI2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>, EVI1-MSI2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>, TTC40-MSI2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>), but we have found that MSI2 is also a frequent partner for an array of translocations in solid cancers including breast, lung and colon cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup> (Supplementary Table 1). This suggests that MSI2 could be functioning as an oncogene in human disease in multiple other contexts, and with multiple other partners. Thus, our work demonstrating that MSI2 translocations can be oncogenic in context of bcCML may provide a paradigm for understanding how dysregulation of this pathway may be oncogenic in a wider array of cancers.</p>

Transcript-level summaries were processed into gene-level summaries and differential gene expression was performed using sleuth with the Wald test<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>. GSEA was performed as previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>. ClueGO was used for gene enrichment analysis of all differentially expressed genes (FDR &lt;0.05) identified between BCR-ABL/Control and BCR-ABL/MSI2-HOXA9 mouse cells. GO and Reactome gene sets were used with medium network specificity, a p-value cutoff of &lt;0.05 and a kappa score of 0.4. All other statistical parameters remained on default settings. CluePedia was used to identify genes found within enriched gene sets. All network analyses ran and visualized in Cytoscape 3.7 (Cytoscape, ClueGO/CluePedia).</p>

<p>This is a very interesting study by Kyle Spinler et al., demonstrating the novel role of MSI2-HOXA9 translocation in the development and pathogenesis of blast crisis CML. The authors employed appropriate in vitro and in vivo assays, including a sophisticated transplantation-based model of CML, which is well-established in the field of studying the pathogenesis of CML. Additionally, the authors successfully concluded that the MSI2 RNA binding domain RRM1 has a preferential impact on the growth of blast crisis CML.</p>
<p>The quality of this research article could be significantly enhanced by addressing the following points:</p>
<p>Major:</p>
<p>(1) Do mice with BCR-ABL/MSI2-HOXA9 leukemia have an increased pool of leukemic stem cells (LSC), or do they have an increased propensity to develop blast cells? Is it the number of LSCs that has increased, or is it the function of LSC to give rise to the disease that has increased? It is not clear if the detected differences in Lineage-negative cells (Figure S1D) were detected in vitro in retrovirally transduced cells or were detected in vivo in transplanted mice. If the differences were detected in vitro, could the author confirm the same findings in vivo? This will greatly enhance the understanding of in vivo disease pathogenesis and could directly link the aggressivity of the disease (shortened survival) with an increased stem cell-like population.</p>
<p>(2) The authors suggest that BCR-ABL/MSI2-HOXA9 leads to the development of blast crisis-CML. One of the main characteristics of blast crisis-CML is drug resistance. Is BCR-ABL/MSI2-HOXA9 leukemia resistant to classical CML treatment drugs?</p>
<p>(3) The authors have emphasized the heightened expression of Polrmt in delineating the mitochondrial phenotype of BCR-ABL/MSI2-HOXA9 leukemia cells. However, the regulatory mechanism governing the expression of Polrmt by MSI2-HOXA9 has not been clearly demonstrated by the authors. Unveiling this mechanism would constitute a novel finding and significantly elevate the quality of the research.</p>
<p>(4) Did the authors observe any survival differences between BCR-ABL/NUP98-HOXA9 and BCR-ABL/MSI2-HOXA9?</p>

<p>The manuscript titled, &quot;Identification of a Musashi2 translocation as a novel oncogene in myeloid leukemia&quot; by Spinler et al. studies the functional role of the translocation t(7;17)(p15;q23), resulting in MSI2/HOXA9 fusion gene, as a secondary driver in bcCML. MSI2-HOXA9 forced expression along with BCR-ABL enhances colony formation and leads to a more aggressive disease in vivo. Depletion of the RNA binding domain RRM1 or RRM2 of MSI2 led to a significant reduction in colony formation, with RRM1 depletion specifically impacting differentiation and blast cell counts. Mechanistically, the authors find that MSI2-HOXA9 aberrantly localizes to the nucleus, elevating the expression of mitochondrial polymerase Polrmt, thereby leading to upregulation of mitochondrial components and enhancing mitochondrial function and basal respiration. Overall, this study examines how the rare MSI2-HOXA9 fusion gene can act as a novel cooperating oncogene and could serve as a secondary hit in the progression of CML to blast crisis.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) Demonstration that MSI2-HOXA9 contributes to oncogenesis in the BCR-ABL context.</p>
<p>(2) Development of a novel cooperativity model for BCR-ABL and provides additional supporting data for the role of MSI2 in leukemogenesis.</p>
<p>(3) Evidence that MSI2-HOXA9 acts uniquely compared to MSI2 alone through nuclear vs. cytoplasmic localization and activation of mitochondrial polymerase Polrmt.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) MSI2-HOXA9 fusion is extremely rare as it has been only found in a handful of patients and it is not clear whether other MSI2 fusions function in a similar manner.</p>
<p>(2) The mechanism needs to be strengthened since MSI2 alone or the HOXA9 mutant may not be linked to the mitochondrial mechanism.</p>
<p>(3) It is not clear that the mitochondrial pathway is sufficient for the MSI2-HOXA9 oncogenic mechanism.</p>

<p>We are grateful to the reviewers for their interest and enthusiasm about the work, and deeply appreciate their constructive comments and suggestions. Our responses are below</p>

<p>We find that BCR-ABL/MSI2-HOXA9 leads to a marked increase in Lineage negative (Lin-) cells which contains the LSC fraction. Specifically, the LSC containing fraction represented 14.1% of the BCR-ABL driven disease and 56.7% of the BCR-ABL and MSI2-HOXA9 driven disease (p&lt;.0001). This suggests that MSI2-HOXA9 triggers the expansion of the undifferentiated LSC containing pool. In addition, the blast frequency was also increased albeit to a lesser extent, with 63.8% blasts (SEM 1.1) for BCR-ABL and 83.3% (SEM 3.1) for BCR-ABL/MSI2-HOXA9 (p=.0001). This suggests that the resulting aggressive disease seen with MSI2-HOXA9 is a consequence of a large increase in undifferentiated  LSC containing cells, as well as the resulting increase in the blast count. The Lin- cells were analyzed from fully established leukemias in vivo (Fig. S1D)</p>

<p>The sensitivity to Imatinib is a very interesting question. In general, while differentiated cells in CML are sensitive to Imatinib, the more undifferentiated cells (LSCs) are resistant1,2. Based on the fact that therapy resistance in blast crisis is largely driven by the undifferentiated fraction of leukemia cells, and given that BCR-ABL/MSI2-HOXA9 driven disease harbors a larger fraction of these undifferentiated cells, we would predict that BCR-ABL/MSI2-HOXA9 leukemia would also be more resistant to imatinib. However, this would need to be experimentally demonstrated and is an important question to address.</p>

<p>Since Polrmt and mitochondrial genes are transcribed in the nucleus we explored whether MSI2-HOXA9 may control mitochondrial gene expression by triggering expression of Polrmt and other key transcription factors. Consistent with this possibility, MSI2-HOXA9 was preferentially found in the nucleus relative to MSI2. In addition, there were 10 occurrences of the minimal MSI2 RRM1 consensus binding sequence UAGU within the Polrmt transcript. While this is consistent with the possibility that Polrmt expression can be post-transcriptionally modulated by MSI2-HOXA9, this needs to be experimentally validated using Clip Seq analysis with wild type MSI2 as well as the MSI2-HOXA9 fusion protein in context of blast crisis CML.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) Did the authors observe any survival differences between BCR-ABL/NUP98-HOXA9 and BCR-ABL/MSI2-HOXA9?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In previous work from our lab we have found that the median survival for BCR-ABL/NUP98-HOXA9 was 17 days, and with BCR-ABL/ MSI2-HOXA9 was 18.5 days (p value of 0.22). This suggests that there is not a significant difference in survival times between the leukemias driven by the distinct alleles, and they may be equally aggressive.</p>

<p>We were very surprised and excited to see the large number of translocations in solid cancers that involve MSI2.  Interestingly, MSI2 translocations occurred both at the N and the C terminus.  Distinct translocations are likely to have unique roles in each disease context. For example, if MSI2’s 5 prime end is part of a translocation, it may functionally contribute via its promoter to drive expression in immature cells and could thus activate oncogenic signals (e.g. controlled by the partner gene) in immature cells which are inherently more susceptible to transformation (Eµ-myc is an example of such a translocation). If Msi2’s RRM domains are part of the fusion, they could bind and target RNAs aberrantly (such as in the wrong cell and the wrong time) and lead to activation of downstream oncogenic mediators. To fully understand the role of each of these translocations in each specific cancer, we would need to experimentally test their impact by ectopic expression in the appropriate cell of origin and domain mapping the basis of any impact in the relevant cancer models as we have done for MSI2-HOXA9 in blast crisis CML in the work we report here.   While this is an intensive undertaking, it is nonetheless important future work as it will undoubtedly lead to new insight about MSI2 linked translocations in diverse solid cancers such as breast cancer and lung cancer.</p>

<p>(2) The mechanism needs to be strengthened since MSI2 alone or the HOXA9 mutant may not be linked to the mitochondrial mechanism. (3) It is not clear that the mitochondrial pathway is sufficient for the MSI2-HOXA9 oncogenic mechanism.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Our observation that MSI2-HOXA9 triggered changes in mitochondrial function was of particular interest as it was (to our knowledge) uncharted in context of Msi2 signaling in cancer, thus leading us to explore this further.  However, multiple other signals are likely downstream regulators and these may well act cooperatively with, or independently of, the heightened­­ mitochondrial function we report here. Among these pathways, the most likely mediators included oncogenic programs related to the Wnt pathway including Wnt, Fzd 3 and Frat1, and those related to the Notch pathway including-Tribbles and Hey1 as well as other stem cell genes such as Aldh1. These programs have been previously implicated in the regulation of myeloid leukemia3-11 and could well mediate the impact of the MSI2-HOXA9 translocation. The relative contribution of mitochondrial metabolism and that of developmental and stem cell signals to the onset of MSI2-HOXA9 driven blast crisis CML is an important avenue of future work.</p>
