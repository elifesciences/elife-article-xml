<title>Introduction</title>
<p><italic>Fusobacterium nucleatum</italic>, a gram-negative bacterium, has received considerable interest in recent years due to its significance in various human diseases, including cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Alon-Maimon et al., 2022</xref>). This anaerobic bacterium is mostly found in the human oral cavity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">De Andrade et al., 2019</xref>). Recent studies showed that <italic>F. nucleatum</italic> influence the progression of various tumor types through its interactions with the host immune system, modulation of inflammatory pathways, and potential involvement in metastatic processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Guo et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Parhi et al., 2020</xref>). <italic>F. nucleatum</italic> not only facilitates but also actively promotes breast cancer proliferation and metastasis through established mechanisms — such as invasion of epithelial and endothelial cells via its virulence factors — as well as through pathways that remain to be elucidated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Guo et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Parhi et al., 2020</xref>). In the context of immune interactions, <italic>F. nucleatum</italic> has been shown to express Fusobacterial apoptosis-inducing protein 2 (Fap2), which engages the TIGIT receptor on natural killer (NK) cells and T cells, leading to immune suppression and inhibition of NK cell cytotoxicity and T cell activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Gur et al., 2015</xref>).</p>
<p>Additionally, another adhesin, CbpF, was found to bind CEACAM1 on T cells modulating their activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Galaski et al., 2021</xref>). We also demonstrated that the RadD protein of <italic>Fusobacterium nucleatum</italic> subsp. <italic>nucleatum</italic> interacts with Siglec-7 on NK cells, leading to the suppression of NK cell-mediated killing of cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Galaski et al., 2024</xref>). In contrast, however, the identity of the <italic>F. nucleatum</italic> ligands that interact with NK activating receptors and how NK cell recognizes this bacterium is still poorly understood. In addition, whether <italic>Fusobacterium nucleatum</italic> could actually inhibits cancer progression of certain tumors is currently unknown.</p>
<p>The natural killer (NK) cell receptor NKp46 has emerged as a focus of research due to its significance in immune response regulation, particularly in the identification and eradication of infected or transformed cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Barrow et al., 2019</xref>). NKp46 was shown to recognize and bind haemagglutinins in both the influenza and the parainfluenza viruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Mandelboim et al., 2001</xref>), Heparan sulfate (HS) and some bacterial and fungal proteins were also identified as ligands for NKp46 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Barrow et al., 2019</xref>). Moreover, NKp46 was found to recognize an externalized calreticulin (ecto-CRT), which translocated from the ER to the cell membrane during ER stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Sen Santara et al., 2023</xref>). NKp46 was shown to interact with <italic>F. nucleatum</italic> in the oral cavity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Chaushu et al., 2012</xref>). However, the <italic>F. nucleatum</italic> ligand that is recognized by NKp46 and whether the interaction between NKp46 and <italic>F. nucleatum</italic> is important in cancer development and patient’s prognosis remains currently unknown.</p>
<p>Here we demonstrate that the <italic>F. nucleatum</italic> ligand for NKp46 is the RadD adhesin and that this interaction plays a significant role in tumor development.</p>

<title>NKp46 Expression Modifies the Prognostic Impact of <italic>F. nucleatum</italic> in a Tumor-Type-Specific Manner</title>
<p>To evaluate the prognostic significance of <italic>Fusobacterium nucleatum</italic> in the context of NKp46 activity, we analyzed transcriptomic data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) alongside microbial abundance profiles from The Cancer Microbiome Atlas (TCMA) across two tumor types. In head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSC), patients exhibiting both <italic>F. nucleatum</italic> positivity and high expression of NKp46 (encoded by NCR1) had significantly improved overall survival compared to NKp46⁺ patients lacking <italic>F. nucleatum</italic> (log-rank <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). Conversely, in colorectal cancer (CRC), <italic>F. nucleatum</italic> status did not significantly stratify survival among NKp46⁺ patients (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). The median survival in the <italic>F. nucleatum</italic>⁺NKp46⁺ HNSC subgroup was 5.81 years, compared to 2.36 years in the <italic>F. nucleatum</italic>⁻NKp46⁺ group, corresponding to a hazard ratio (HR) of 2.08 (95% CI: 1.20–3.61; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). In CRC, median survival was similar between <italic>F. nucleatum</italic>⁺NKp46⁺ patients (5.15 years) and their <italic>F. nucleatum</italic>⁻ counterparts (5.85 years), with no significant difference in risk (HR = 0.71, 95% CI: 0.26–1.95; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). Importantly, NKp46 expression levels were substantially higher in HNSC compared to CRC (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>), suggesting a possible threshold-dependent effect of NKp46 on microbial-immune interactions. Together, these findings underscore a tumor-type-specific interplay between microbial colonization and immune contexture, positioning NKp46 as a key modulator of <italic>F. nucleatum</italic>–associated clinical outcomes.</p>

<title>NKp46 binds RadD</title>
<p>We previously reported that NKp46 interacts with <italic>Fusobacterium nucleatum</italic> and that this interaction plays a role in the context of periodontal disease <sup>11</sup>. However, the identity of the <italic>F. nucleatum</italic> ligand recognized by NKp46 has remained unknown. Given that co-occurrence of NKp46 expression and <italic>F. nucleatum</italic> presence correlates with improved prognosis in certain tumors—most notably head and neck squamous cell carcinoma—identifying the specific NKp46-binding ligand on <italic>F. nucleatum</italic> is of critical importance for understanding the underlying mechanisms and potential therapeutic implications of this interaction.</p>
<p>To identify the <italic>F. nucleatum</italic> ligand of NKp46, we assessed the binding of NKp46 Ig, its D1 domain (D1 Ig), its mouse orthologue Ncr-1 Ig and CD16 Ig to FITC-labeled <italic>F. nucleatum</italic> strains <italic>ATCC 10953</italic> and <italic>ATCC 23726</italic>, which represent the subspecies <italic>polymorphum</italic> and <italic>nucleatum</italic>, respectively (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). Surprisingly, NKp46, its D1 domain and the mouse Ncr-1 exhibited higher binding to <italic>ATCC 10953</italic> compared to <italic>ATCC 23726</italic> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>), while little or no binding was observed for the CD16 which was used as a control.</p>

<p>While we were staining various <italic>F. nucleatum</italic> deleted strains with NKp46, we observed an unexpected binding elevation of NKp46 Ig and Ncr1 Ig to FadI deleted mutant (<italic>ATCC 10593 ΔFadI</italic>), while the expression of a control Ig fusion protein CEACAM1 (Ccm-1 Ig) was only minimally increased (please compare <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3A and B</xref>). Since we showed previously that the absence of FadI results in overexpression of RadD (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref> and (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Shokeen et al., 2020</xref>)), we incubated Ccm-1 Ig, NKp46 Ig and Ncr-1 Ig with a FITC-labeled <italic>ATCC 10953</italic> mutant lacking the major multifunctional adhesin RadD (<italic>ATCC 10593 ΔRadD</italic>). Interestingly, we observed that the lack of RadD abolished fusobacterial binding of NKp46 Ig and Ncr-1 Ig (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>).</p>

<p>Quantification of binding levels confirmed that the absence of FadI resulted in a 250-300-fold increase in binding of NKp46 Ig and Ncr1 Ig to <italic>ATCC 10953 ΔFad-I,</italic> while the absence of RadD almost completely abolished this interaction (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>, left). A similar effect was observed for the corresponding mutant strains of <italic>ATCC 23726</italic> albeit at a lower level (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>, right) with <italic>ATCC 23726 Δfad-I</italic> exhibiting an about 100-fold increase, which is abolished in the absence of RadD. These findings indicate that the autotransporter protein RadD is the ligand of NKp46.</p>

<title>Arginine and anti-NKp46 antibody inhibit the binding of NKp46 to RadD</title>
<p>Since RadD is an arginine-inhibitable protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Kaplan et al., 2009</xref>), we tested whether arginine can block RadD binding to NKp46 or its mouse ortholog Ncr-1. Incubation of FITC-labelled <italic>ATCC 10953</italic> with arginine followed by staining with NKp46 Ig and Ncr-1 Ig revealed that arginine inhibits NKp46 and Ncr-1 Ig binding in a concentration-dependent manner (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>).</p>

<p>NKp46 consists of two extracellular domains, a membrane-distal (D1) domain and a membrane-proximal (D2) domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Barrow et al., 2019</xref>). Previous studies indicate that the vast majority of NKp46 ligands are recognized through the domain (D2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Arnon et al., 2004</xref>). Interestingly, <italic>F. nucleatum</italic> seemed to be recognized by the D1 domain of the NKp46 receptor (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). To test whether the D1 domain of NKp46 is involved in its binding to <italic>F. nucleatum</italic> we used several anti-human NKp46 antibodies (461-G1, hNKp46.02 (02), and 9E2) that were previously shown to bind the D1 domain of NKp46 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Berhani et al., 2019</xref>). We pre-incubated NKp46 Ig individually with all of these antibodies prior to addition to <italic>ATCC 10953</italic>. Notably, no difference in binding of <italic>ATCC 10953</italic> was observed when the NKp46 Ig was incubated with either 9E2, 461-G1, or anti-PVR antibody which served as controls (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>). However, blocking with hNKp46.02 (02) antibody significantly reduced the NKp46 Ig-<italic>ATTC 10953</italic> interaction (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>, quantified in 4C). These findings confirm that the NKp46 receptor interacts with <italic>ATCC 10953</italic> specifically via its D1 domain.</p>

Hence, we co-incubated or not NK cells with the 02 antibody. Subsequently, NK cells were co-cultured with human mammary gland carcinoma cell lines (MCF7, T47D) that were incubated with <italic>ATCC 10953</italic> or with the corresponding <italic>ΔRadD</italic> mutant strains. NK cytotoxicity was assessed using the Calcein-AM assay (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). We observed that the 02 antibody had no effect on NK cell cytotoxicity against breast cancer cell lines, in the absence of <italic>F. nucleatum</italic>. However, a significant increase in tumor cell killing (approx.1.2-1.5-fold change) was noticed for unblocked NK cells compared to 02 blocked NK cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5C</xref>). Interestingly, this increased NK cytotoxicity was diminished when the tumor cells were incubated with <italic>ATCC 10953 ΔRadD</italic> and in the absence of RadD NKp46 blocking had no effect (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5C</xref>).</p>

<p>To test whether the NKp46-RadD interactions are important for controlling tumor growth, we established a syngeneic mouse breast cancer model by implanting AT3 cell line orthotopically in the mammary fat pad of C57BL\6 wild type (WT) and Ncr-1 deficient mice (NCR-1 KO). The tumor was allowed to grow to reach approximately 500 mm<sup>3</sup> in volume prior to intravenous inoculation with either <italic>ATCC 10953</italic> or <italic>ATCC 10953 ΔRadD</italic>. Mice were sacrificed on day 8 following the bacteria injection and tumor weight was measured (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>). The tumor weight was significantly increased when wild type <italic>ATCC 10953</italic> was inoculated as compared to uninfected tumor-bearing WT mice (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref>). Strikingly, a further increase in tumor weight was observed when mice were injected with <italic>ATCC 10953 ΔRadD</italic> mutant bacterium (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref>). The increased tumor growth was not observed in the NCR-1 KO mice (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5F</xref>). These results indicate that <italic>RadD</italic> recognition by the NKp46 activating receptor is required for better cytotoxicity against tumors infected with <italic>F. nucleatum</italic>.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Patient prognosis is a key determinant in the association between <italic>Fusobacterium nucleatum</italic> infection and tumour development and progression, for instance, in colorectal cancer (CRC) metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Lee et al., 2021</xref>). To date, no evidence has clarified whether NKp46 activation in response to <italic>F. nucleatum</italic> plays a significant role in influencing patient survival. Our analysis of TCGA PanCancer and TCMA datasets revealed that co-occurrence of <italic>F. nucleatum</italic> and NKp46 expression is associated with a protective effect in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSC) patients. In contrast, no such association was observed in colorectal cancer (CRC) cohorts, likely due to markedly lower NKp46 expression levels in these patients.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Cerami et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">de Bruijn et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Dohlman et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Gao et al., 2013</xref>).</p>
<p>In this study, we demonstrate that the RadD protein of <italic>F. nucleatum</italic> is specifically recognized by the D1 domain of the NKp46 receptor. This interaction enhances the ability of NK cells to kill tumor cells infected with <italic>F. nucleatum</italic>. Previous studies have shown that <italic>F. nucleatum</italic> promotes tumor growth in both breast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Parhi et al., 2020</xref>) and colorectal cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Zhu et al., 2024</xref>), and suppresses immune cell activity through engagement of three inhibitory receptors: CEACAM1, TIGIT, and Siglec-7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Galaski et al., 2024</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Gur et al., 2015</xref>). Furthermore, it was also shown that CD147 which is overexpressed on the surface of colorectal cancer (CRC) cells also binds to RadD. The binding of RadD to CD147 leads to the enrichment of <italic>F. nucleatum</italic> within CRC tissues, triggering an oncogenic cascade PI3K– AKT–NF-κB signaling pathway, which promotes tumorigenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Zhang et al., 2024</xref>). Here, we uncover a counterbalancing mechanism, whereby NK cells overcome this immune suppression through NKp46-mediated recognition of RadD and that in the absence of this interaction tumor growth is even further increased.</p>
<p><italic>F. nucleatum</italic> RadD is an outer membrane autotransporter protein that mediates binding between <italic>F. nucleatum</italic> and other oral bacteria by promoting interspecies interactions, which facilitates dental plaque development and virulence in periodontal disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Kaplan et al., 2009</xref>). RadD in combination with Fap2, have been identified as virulence factors capable of inducing cell death in lymphocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Kaplan et al., 2010</xref>). As an adhesin, RadD facilitates the coaggregation of <italic>F. nucleatum</italic> synergistically with <italic>Clostridioides difficile</italic> (<italic>C. difficile</italic>). This interaction promotes biofilm formation within the intestinal mucus, potentially contributing to the pathogenesis of <italic>C. difficile</italic> infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Engevik et al., 2021</xref>). Fusobacterium-associated defensin inducer (Fad-I) is a cell wall-associated diacylated lipoprotein from <italic>F. nucleatum</italic> that acts as a key microbial molecule that enhances the host’s innate immune response at mucosal surfaces by promoting human beta-defensin (hBD-2) expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bhattacharyya et al., 2016</xref>). Inactivation of the <italic>fad-I</italic> (<italic>Δfad-I</italic>) gene results in a significant increase in <italic>radD</italic> gene expression, leading to elevated <italic>radD</italic> transcript levels and subsequently the binding to <italic>Streptococcus gordonii</italic> was increased (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Shokeen et al., 2020</xref>).</p>
<p>While NKp46 showed strong binding to <italic>F. nucleatum</italic> subsp. <italic>polymorphum (ATCC 10953)</italic>, less binding was observed for <italic>F. nucleatum</italic> subsp. <italic>nucleatum (ATCC 23726)</italic>. The differences in binding could be due to substantial differences in RadD expression between the different <italic>F. nucleatum</italic> subspecies.</p>
<p>Given that deletion of <italic>F. nucleatum fad-I</italic> resulted in elevated surface expression of RadD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Shokeen et al., 2020</xref>), we noticed enhanced binding to both human and mouse NKp46 receptors. However, this interaction was abolished in the <italic>F. nucleatum ΔRadD</italic> strain, identifying RadD as NKp46 ligand. Consistent with previous studies, we revealed that NKp46 binding to RadD is arginine-dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Kaplan et al., 2009</xref>), which not only impairs <italic>F. nucleatum</italic> adhesion and biofilm formation but also reduces its interaction with NKp46.</p>
<p>Importantly, using the NKp46 blocking antibody (02 mAb), which targets the D1 domain of the receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Berhani et al., 2019</xref>), we demonstrated that this antibody effectively disrupts <italic>F. nucleatum</italic> binding to NKp46 and impairs NK cell-mediated killing against tumor cells. In our <italic>in vivo</italic> model, WT mice infected with the <italic>ATCC 10953ΔRadD</italic> strain exhibited significantly greater tumor weight relative to those infected with the wild-type <italic>ATCC 10953</italic> strain.</p>
<p>Intriguingly, infection with either the wild-type <italic>ATCC 10953</italic> or <italic>ATCC 10953</italic> Δ<italic>RadD</italic> strains was not able to affect tumor progression in NCR-1 KO mice. These results collectively support our hypothesis that NK cell cytotoxicity is mediated by the presence of NKp46 on NK cells and the expression of RadD on the <italic>F. nucleatum</italic> surface (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>).</p>

<p>Our findings align with those of another group that investigated the <italic>ΔRadD</italic> mutant in a mouse model of preterm birth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Wu et al., 2021</xref>). Using the <italic>ATCC 23726</italic> strain the authors revealed earlier and increased invasion of the <italic>ΔRadD</italic> strain which reached the placenta, amniotic fluid, and fetus sooner and continued accumulating over time in comparison with the WT <italic>F. nucleatum.</italic> Moreover, the RadD mutant exhibited reduced systemic clearance, with no decline observed in liver or spleen levels, suggesting impaired immune evasion or a lack of control over dissemination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Wu et al., 2021</xref>).</p>
<p>In conclusion, we demonstrate that <italic>Fusobacterium nucleatum</italic> RadD functions as a direct ligand for NKp46 and highlight its critical role in modulating NK cell activity both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. Strategies aimed at elevating NKp46 expression or enhancing its activity might further strengthen NK cell responses and help reduce cancer development associated with <italic>F. nucleatum</italic> infection.</p>

<p>This <bold>useful</bold> study describes a mechanism of microbial modulation of anti-tumor immunity, which is of considerable interest in the field. However, the experimental supports for the key mechanistic claim, the interaction between RadD and NKp46, are not robust. Multiple experimental inconsistencies, especially in vivo, weaken the conclusions, making the strength of evidence <bold>incomplete</bold>. Additional controls, direct binding assays, and clarification of in vivo mechanistic relevance would strengthen the work.</p>

<p>In this manuscript, Rishiq et al. investigate whether natural killer (NK) cells can interact with Fusobacterium nucleatum and identify the molecular mediators involved in this interaction. The authors propose that the bacterial adhesin RadD may bind to the activating NK cell receptor NKp46 (NCR1 in mice), leading to NK cell activation and tumor control. While the topic is of significant interest and the hypothesis intriguing, the manuscript lacks critical experimental evidence, contains several technical concerns, and requires substantial revisions.</p>
<p>Major Concerns:</p>
<p>(1) Lack of Direct Evidence for RadD-NKp46 Interaction</p>
<p>The central claim that RadD interacts with NKp46 is not formally demonstrated. A direct binding assay (e.g., Biacore, ELISA, or pull-down with purified proteins) is essential to support this assertion. The absence of this fundamental experiment weakens the mechanistic conclusions of the study.</p>
<p>(2) Figure 2: Binding Specificity and Bacterial Strains</p>
<p>A CEACAM1-Ig control should be included in all binding experiments to distinguish between specific and non-specific Ig interactions. There is differential Ig binding between strains ATCC 23726 and 10953. The authors should quantify RadD expression in each strain to determine if the difference in binding is due to variation in RadD levels.</p>
<p>(3) Figure 3: Flow Cytometry Inconsistencies and Missing Controls</p>
<p>What do the FITC-negative, Ig-negative events represent? The authors should clarify whether these are background signals, bacterial aggregates, or debris.</p>
<p>Panel B, CEACAM1-Ig binding appears markedly increased compared to WT bacteria. The reason for this enhancement should be discussed-does it reflect upregulation of the bacterial ligand or an artifact of overexpression? Fluorescence compensation should be carefully reviewed for the NKp46/NCR1-Ig binding assays to ensure that the signals are not due to spectral overlap or nonspecific binding. Importantly, binding experiments using the FadI/RadD double knockout strain are missing and should be included. This control is essential.</p>
<p>In Panel E, the basis for calculating fold-change in MFI is unclear. Please indicate the reference condition to which the change is normalized.</p>
<p>(4) Figure 4: Binding Inhibition and Receptor Sensitivity</p>
<p>Panel A lacks representative FACS plots and is currently difficult to interpret. Differences in the sensitivity of human vs. mouse NKp46 to arginine inhibition should be discussed, given species differences in receptor-ligand interactions. What are the inhibition results using F. nucleatum strains deficient in FadI?</p>
<p>In Panel B, CEACAM1-Ig and RadD-deficient bacteria must be included as negative controls for binding specificity upon anti-NKp46 blocking.</p>
<p>(5) Figure 5: Functional NK Activation and Tumor Killing</p>
<p>In Panels B and C, the key control condition (NK cells + anti-NKp46, without bacteria) is missing. This is needed to evaluate if NKp46 recognition is involved in tumor killing. The authors should explicitly test whether pre-incubation of NK cells with bacteria enhances their anti-tumor activity. Alternatively, could bacteria induce stress signals in tumor cells that sensitize them to NK killing? This distinction is critical.</p>
<p>(6) Figure 5D: Mechanism of Peripheral Activation</p>
<p>It is suggested that contact between bacteria and NK cells in the periphery leads to their activation. Can the authors confirm whether this pre-activation leads to enhanced killing of tumor targets, or if bacteria-tumor co-localization is required? The literature indicates that F. nucleatum localizes intracellularly within tumor cells. If so, how is RadD accessible to NKp46 on infiltrating NK cells?</p>
<p>(8) Figure 5E and In Vivo Relevance</p>
<p>Surprisingly, F. nucleatum infection is associated with increased tumor burden. Does this reflect an immunosuppressive effect? Are NK cells inhibited or exhausted in infected mice (TGIT, SIGLEC7...)? If NK cell activation leads to reduced tumor control in the infected context, the role of RadD-induced activation needs further explanation. RadD-deficient bacteria, which do not activate NK cells, result in even poorer tumor control. This paradox needs to be addressed: how can NK activation impair tumor control while its absence also reduces tumor control?</p>
<p>(9) NKp46-Deficient Mice: Inconsistencies</p>
<p>In Ncr1⁻/⁻ mice, infection with WT or RadD-deficient F. nucleatum has no impact on tumor burden. This suggests that NKp46 is dispensable in this context and casts doubt on the physiological relevance of the proposed mechanism. This contradiction should be discussed more thoroughly.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In the present study, Rishiq et al. investigated whether the RadD protein expressed by Fusobacterium nucleatum subsp. Nucleatum serves as a natural ligand for the NK-activating receptor NKp46, and whether RadD-NKp46 interaction enhances NK cell cytotoxicity against tumor cells. To address this, the authors first performed an association analysis of F. nucleatum abundance and NKp46 expression in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSC) and colorectal cancer (CRC) using the TCMA and TCGA databases, respectively. While a positive association between NKp46⁺ and F. nucleatum⁺ status with improved overall survival was observed in HNSC patients, no such correlation was found in CRC.</p>
<p>Next, they examined the binding of NKp46-Ig to various F. nucleatum strains. To confirm that this interaction was mediated specifically by RadD, they employed a RadD-deficient mutant strain. Finally, to establish the functional relevance of the RadD-NKp46 interaction in promoting NK cell cytotoxicity and anti-tumor responses, they utilized a syngeneic mouse breast cancer model. In this setup, AT3 cells were orthotopically implanted into the mammary fat pad of C57BL/6 wild-type (WT) or Ncr1-deficient (NCR1⁻/⁻; murine orthologue of human NKp46) mice, followed by intravenous inoculation with either WT F. nucleatum or the ∆RadD mutant strain.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>A notable strength of the work is that it identifies a previously unrecognized activating interaction between F. nucleatum RadD and the NK cell receptor NKp46, demonstrating that the same bacterial protein can engage distinct NK cell receptors (activating or inhibitory) to exert context-dependent effects on anti-tumor immunity. This dual-receptor insight adds depth to our understanding of F. nucleatum-immune interactions and highlights the complexity of microbial modulation of the tumor microenvironment.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) A previous study by this group (PMID: 38952680) demonstrated that RadD of F. nucleatum binds to NK cells via Siglec-7, thereby diminishing their cytotoxic potential. They further proposed that the RadD-Siglec-7 interaction could act as an immune evasion mechanism exploited by tumor cells. In contrast, the present study reports that RadD of F. nucleatum can also bind to the activating receptor NKp46 on NK cells, thereby enhancing their cytotoxic function.</p>
<p>While F. nucleatum-mediated tumor progression has been documented in breast and colon cancers, the current study proposes an NK-activating role for F. nucleatum in HNSC. However, it remains unclear whether tumor-infiltrating NK cells in HNSC exhibit differential expression of NKp46 compared to Siglec-7. Furthermore, heterogeneity within the NK cell compartment, particularly in the relative abundance of NKp46⁺ versus Siglec-7⁺ subsets, may differ substantially among breast, colon, and HNSC tumors. Such differences could have been readily investigated using publicly available single-cell datasets. A deeper understanding of this subset heterogeneity in NK cells would better explain why F. nucleatum is passively associated with a favorable prognosis in HNSC but correlates with poor outcomes in breast and colon cancers.</p>
<p>(2) The in vivo tumor data (Figure 5D-F) appear to contradict the authors' claims. Specifically, Figure 5E suggests that WT mice engrafted with AT3 breast tumors and inoculated with WT F. nucleatum exhibited an even greater tumor burden compared to mice not inoculated with F. nucleatum, indicating a tumor-promoting effect. This finding conflicts with the interpretation presented in both the results and discussion sections.</p>
<p>(3) Although the authors acknowledge that F. nucleatum may have tumor context-specific roles in regulating NK cell responses, it is unclear why they chose a breast cancer model in which F. nucleatum has been reported to promote tumor growth. A more appropriate choice would have been the well-established preclinical oral cancer model, such as the 4-nitroquinoline 1-oxide (4NQO)-induced oral cancer model in C57BL/6 mice, which would more directly relate to HNSC biology.</p>
<p>(4) Since RadD of F. nucleatum can bind to both Siglec-7 and NKp46 on NK cells, exerting opposing functional effects, the expression profiles of both receptors on intratumoral NK cells should be evaluated. This would clarify the balance between activating and inhibitory signals in the tumor microenvironment and provide a more mechanistic explanation for the observed tumor context-dependent outcomes.</p>

<p>Major Concerns:</p>
<p>(1) Lack of Direct Evidence for RadD-NKp46 Interaction</p>
<p>The central claim that RadD interacts with NKp46 is not formally demonstrated. A direct binding assay (e.g., Biacore, ELISA, or pull-down with purified proteins) is essential to support this assertion. The absence of this fundamental experiment weakens the mechanistic conclusions of the study.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The reviewer is correct. Direct assays are currently quite impossible because RadD is huge protein and it will take years to purify it. Instead, we used immunoprecipitation assays using NKp46-Ig (Author response images 1 and 2). Fusobacteria were lysed using RIPA buffer, and the lysates were centrifuged twice to separate the supernatant from the pellet (which contains the bacterial membranes). The resulting lysates were incubated overnight with 2.5 µg of purified NKp46 and protein G-beads. After thorough washing, the bound proteins were placed in sample buffer and heated at 95 °C for 8 minutes. The eluates were run on a 10% acrylamide gel and visualized by Coomassie blue staining. As can be seen the NKp46-Ig was able to precipitate protein band around 350Kd in both F. <italic>polymorphum ATCC10953</italic> (Author response image 1) and in <italic>F. nucleatum</italic> <italic>ATCC23726</italic> (Author response image 2).</p>

<p>A CEACAM1-Ig control should be included in all binding experiments to distinguish between specific and non-specific Ig interactions. There is differential Ig binding between strains ATCC 23726 and 10953. The authors should quantify RadD expression in each strain to determine if the difference in binding is due to variation in RadD levels.</p>

<p>Panel B, CEACAM1-Ig binding appears markedly increased compared to WT bacteria. The reason for this enhancement should be discussed-does it reflect upregulation of the bacterial ligand or an artifact of overexpression? Fluorescence compensation should be carefully reviewed for the NKp46/NCR1-Ig binding assays to ensure that the signals are not due to spectral overlap or nonspecific binding. Importantly, binding experiments using the FadI/RadD double knockout strain are missing and should be included. This control is essential.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We don’t know why expression of CEACAM1-Ig binding is increased. Indeed, it will be nice to have the FadI/RadD double knockout strain which we currently don’t have.</p>

<p>Differences in the sensitivity of human vs. mouse NKp46 to arginine inhibition should be discussed, given species differences in receptor-ligand interactions.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Ncr1, the murine orthologue of human NKp46, shares approximately 58% sequence identity with its human counterpart (1). The observed differences in arginine-mediated inhibition of bacterial binding between mouse and human NKp46 might stem from structural differences or distinct posttranslational modifications, such as glycosylation. Indeed, prediction algorithms combined with high-performance liquid chromatography analysis revealed that Ncr1 possesses two putative novel O-glycosylation sites, of which only one is conserved in humans (2).</p>

<p>In Panel B, CEACAM1-Ig and RadD-deficient bacteria must be included as negative controls for binding specificity upon anti-NKp46 blocking.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the request to include CEACAM1-Ig and RadD-deficient bacteria as negative controls for specificity under anti-NKp46 blocking. We don’t not think it is necessary since the 02 antibody is specific for NKp46, we used other anti0NKp46 antibodies that did not block the interaction and an irrelevant antibofy, we showed that arginine produced a dose-dependent reduction in NKp46/Ncr1 binding, consistent with an arginine-inhibitable RadD interaction already shown in our manuscript (Fig. 4A). The ΔRadD strains we used already demonstrate loss of NKp46/Ncr1 binding and loss of NK-boosting activity (Figs. 3, 5). Collectively, these data establish that NKp46/Ncr1 recognition of a high-molecular-weight ligand consistent with RadD is specific and functionally relevant.</p>

<p>Figure 5: Functional NK Activation and Tumor Killing</p>
<p>In Panels B and C, the key control condition (NK cells + anti-NKp46, without bacteria) is missing. This is needed to evaluate if NKp46 recognition is involved in tumor killing. The authors should explicitly test whether pre-incubation of NK cells with bacteria enhances their anti-tumor activity.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>No significant difference in NK cell cytotoxicity was observed between untreated NK cells and NK cells incubated with anti-NKp46 antibody in the absence of bacteria.

<p>(6) Figure 5D: Mechanism of Peripheral Activation</p>
<p>It is suggested that contact between bacteria and NK cells in the periphery leads to their activation. Can the authors confirm whether this pre-activation leads to enhanced killing of tumor targets, or if bacteria-tumor co-localization is required? The literature indicates that F. nucleatum localizes intracellularly within tumor cells. If so, how is RadD accessible to NKp46 on infiltrating NK cells?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We do not expect that pre-activation of NK cells with bacteria would enhance their tumor-killing capacity. In fact, when NK cells were co-incubated with bacteria, we occasionally observed NK cell death. Although <italic>F. nucleatum</italic> can reside intracellularly, bacterial entry requires prior adhesion to tumor cells. At this stage—before internalization—the bacteria are accessible for recognition and binding by NK cells.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(8) Figure 5E and In Vivo Relevance</p>
<p>Surprisingly, F. nucleatum infection is associated with increased tumor burden. Does this reflect an immunosuppressive effect? Are NK cells inhibited or exhausted in infected mice (TGIT, SIGLEC7...)? If NK cell activation leads to reduced tumor control in the infected context, the role of RadD-induced activation needs further explanation. RadD-deficient bacteria, which do not activate NK cells, result in even poorer tumor control. This paradox needs to be addressed: how can NK activation impair tumor control while its absence also reduces tumor control?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Siglec-7 lacks a direct orthologue in mice, and neither mouse TIGIT nor CEACAM1 bind <italic>F. nucleatum</italic>. The increased tumor burden observed in infected mice may therefore result from bacterial interference with immune cell infiltration and accumulation within the tumor microenvironment (Parhi, L., Alon-Maimon, T., Sol, A. et al. Breast cancer colonization by Fusobacterium nucleatum accelerates tumor growth and metastatic progression. Nat Commun 11, 3259 (2020)). Consequently, the NK cells that do reach the tumor site can recognize and kill <italic>F. nucleatum</italic>–bearing tumor cells through RadD–NKp46 interactions. In the absence of RadD, this recognition is impaired, leading to reduced NK-mediated cytotoxicity and increased tumor growth.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(9) NKp46-Deficient Mice: Inconsistencies</p>
<p>In Ncr1⁻/⁻ mice, infection with WT or RadD-deficient F. nucleatum has no impact on tumor burden. This suggests that NKp46 is dispensable in this context and casts doubt on the physiological relevance of the proposed mechanism. This contradiction should be discussed more thoroughly.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Ncr1 is also directly involved in mediating NK cell–dependent killing of tumor cells, even in the absence of bacterial infection. Therefore, in Ncr1-deficient mice, F. nucleatum has no additional effect on tumor progression (Glasner, A., Ghadially, H., Gur, C., Stanietsky, N., Tsukerman, P., Enk, J., Mandelboim, O.
