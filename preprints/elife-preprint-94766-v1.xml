<title>Abstract</title><p>To promote fidelity in nuclear pre-mRNA splicing, the spliceosome rejects and discards suboptimal splicing substrates after they have engaged the spliceosome. Although nuclear quality control mechanisms have been proposed to retain immature mRNPs, evidence indicates that discarded splicing substrates, including lariat intermediates, do export to the cytoplasm, as indicated by their translation and degradation by cytoplasmic nucleases. However, the mechanism for exporting these species has remained unknown. By single molecule (sm) RNA FISH in budding yeast, we have directly observed the nuclear export of lariat intermediates. Further, by crosslinking, export reporter assays, and smRNA FISH, we have demonstrated that the export of lariat intermediates requires the general mRNA export receptor Mex67p and three of its mRNA export adapter proteins, Nab2p, Yra1p, and Nlp3, establishing that mRNAs and lariat intermediates share the same export machinery. Unexpectedly, the export of lariat intermediates, but not mRNA, requires an interaction between Nab2p and Mlp1p, a nuclear basket component implicated in retaining immature mRNPs, including unspliced pre-mRNA, in the nucleus of budding yeast. Finally, the export of lariat intermediates, like mRNA, relies on the E3 ubiquitin ligase Tom1p and its target sites in Yra1p. Overall, our data indicate that the nuclear basket can promote, rather than antagonize, the export of an immature mRNP. Further, our data imply that the export of discarded lariat intermediates requires both Mlp1p-dependent docking onto the nuclear basket and subsequent Tom1p-mediated undocking, a mechanism our data suggests functions in the export of mRNA also but in a manner obscured by redundant pathways.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In eukaryotes, the nuclear membrane uncouples translation from mRNA transcription and processing, thereby necessitating mRNA export through the nuclear pore complex (NPC; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Petrovic et al., 2022</xref>), after transcription and RNA processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Niño et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Xie and Ren, 2019</xref>). Because the NPC establishes a permeability barrier, the export of such substrates requires the binding of export receptors to enable passage through the pore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Petrovic et al., 2022</xref>). The export of most mRNAs requires the heterodimeric export receptor – Mex67p-Mtr2p in yeast or NXF1-NXT1 in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Grüter et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Katahira et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Segref et al., 1997</xref>). The binding of Mex67p-Mtr2p to mRNA is mediated by export adapters, which bind mRNA in a manner that is generally coupled to transcription and RNA processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Ben-Yishay and Shav-Tal, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Stewart, 2019</xref>). Such coupling imparts specificity to Mex67p-Mtr2p binding. In a complementary manner, nuclear retention and decay have been invoked as a quality control mechanism that restricts the export of some mRNA transcripts, including immature or improperly processed messages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Palazzo and Lee, 2018</xref>). For example, the exosome, the PAXT complex, and PAXT complex components, especially ZFH3C1, have been implicated in retention and decay of such RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Hilleren et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Kwiatek et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Lee et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Ogami et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Silla et al., 2018</xref>). In addition, the nuclear basket has been implicated in budding yeast and humans in the nuclear retention of incompletely spliced transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Coyle et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Galy et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Palancade et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Rajanala and Nandicoori, 2012</xref>); however, an absolute requirement for such a nuclear-basket quality control mechanism is challenged by a number of observations that also raise questions concerning the actual role of factors implicated in nuclear retention at the nuclear basket (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Aksenova et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Iino, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Lee et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Mayas et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Palazzo and Lee, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Sayani and Chanfreau, 2012</xref>). We have gained insight into these issues by investigating the proofreading of pre-mRNA splicing.</p>
<p>Pre-mRNA splicing is catalyzed by the spliceosome, a ribonucleoprotein machine that comprises over 80 conserved proteins and five small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Wilkinson et al., 2020</xref>). The snRNA components play key roles in recognizing the substrate and catalyzing intron excision through two transesterification reactions; in the first reaction, branching, the 2’ hydroxyl of the branch site attacks the 5’ splice site, yielding a lariat intermediate and a free 5’ exon, which in the second reaction, exon ligation, attacks the 3’ splice site to yield mRNA and an excised intron. Proofreading in splicing functions to enhance the specificity of splice site choice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Semlow and Staley, 2012</xref>). Grossly suboptimal splice sites never bind the spliceosome, but suboptimal splice sites do bind, necessitating downstream mechanisms to distinguish and reject such splice sites. Indeed, proofreading mechanisms have been implicated throughout the splicing cycle, including the phases of spliceosome assembly, activation, and catalysis. ATPases of the DEAD and DExH families of the helicase II superfamily play a central role in proofreading (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">De Bortoli et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Semlow and Staley, 2012</xref>). In addition to driving the splicing cycle forward in the case of optimal splice sites, these ATPases also reject and discard splicing substrates having suboptimal splice sites. For example, the DExH ATPase Prp22p, in the case of an optimal substrate, promotes the release of mRNA from the spliceosome after exon ligation, but in the case of a suboptimal 3’ splice site, Prp22p rejects the splice site by undocking the splice site from the catalytic core before exon ligation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Mayas et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Semlow et al., 2016</xref>). If an alternative, optimal 3’ splice site does not engage the spliceosome, then a second DExH ATPase Prp43p, which acts as a general terminator of splicing, disassembles the spliceosome, discarding the suboptimal substrate at the intermediate stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Mayas et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Pandit et al., 2006</xref>). As a consequence of such proofreading pathways, any mechanism proposed to enforce robust quality control of mRNA export would need to distinguish against not only pre-mRNA that failed to engage the spliceosome but also pre-mRNA that did engage the spliceosome but subsequently suffered discard at either the pre-mRNA or the intermediate stage. A robust quality control mechanism to discriminate against the nuclear export of such species has been thought to be essential to preclude the translation of such species into truncated protein products (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Coyle et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Galy et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Rajanala and Nandicoori, 2012</xref>) (but see below).</p>
<p>Specific factors have been implicated in coupling transcription and RNA processing to mRNA export and in the nuclear retention of immature species to establish specificity in mRNA export (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Tutucci and Stutz, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Schmid and Jensen, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Palazzo and Lee, 2018</xref>). For example, the TREX complex, which functions in transcription elongation and mRNA export, favors the export of spliced RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Masuda et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Tutucci and Stutz, 2011</xref>). Further, reporter assays have implicated Mlp1p (TPR in humans), a subunit of the nuclear basket, as a quality control factor for retaining faulty RNA transcripts, especially unspliced pre-mRNAs, in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Coyle et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Galy et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Palancade et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Rajanala and Nandicoori, 2012</xref>). However, several observations question the requirement for strict quality control mechanisms in mRNA export. First, several studies found that Mlp1p/TPR does not act as a general quality control factor in broadly retaining pre-mRNA in the nucleus and instead promotes mRNA export in some cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bangs et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Green et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bae et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Xu et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Lee et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Zuckerman et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Aksenova et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Iino, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Sayani and Chanfreau, 2012</xref>). Further, evidence indicates that pre-mRNA and splicing intermediates can be localized to the cytoplasm in both budding yeast and humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Mayas et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Harigaya and Parker, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Sayani and Chanfreau, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Carvalho et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Talhouarne and Gall, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Hilleren and Parker, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Legrain and Rosbash, 1989</xref>). Lastly, disabling the nonsense-mediated decay machinery stabilizes pre-mRNAs in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Sayani and Chanfreau, 2012</xref>). These observations raise questions about a strict requirement for quality control in mRNA export and the role of factors implicated in nuclear retention, in particular, the nuclear basket. Further, the cytoplasmic localization of splicing intermediates raises questions concerning the pathway utilized for export and the relation of this pathway to mRNA export, because, for example, a cleaved 5’ exon lacks a poly(A) tail, and a lariat intermediate lacks a cap, both features of mRNA implicated in promoting export.</p>
<p>In yeast, several mRNA export adapters have been identified, including the SR-like protein Npl3p, Nab2p, the TREX-2 complex, and the TREX complex, featuring Yra1p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Tutucci and Stutz, 2011</xref>). In addition to interacting with mRNA and Mex67p-Mtr2p, these adapters often interact with additional factors. For instance, the N-terminal domain of Nab2, a poly-A tail binding protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Anderson et al., 1993</xref>), interacts directly with the C-terminal domain of Mlp1p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Grant et al., 2008</xref>). Yra1p has also been implicated in binding to the nuclear basket, through interactions with Mlp1p and Mlp2p in an RNA-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Vinciguerra et al., 2005</xref>). Interestingly, the E3 ubiquitin ligase Tom1p ubiquitylates Yra1p and then dissociates Yra1p from mRNAs in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Iglesias et al., 2010</xref>). Deletion of <italic>TOM1</italic> inhibits mRNA export at high temperature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Duncan et al., 2000</xref>), and genetic assays imply that deletion of <italic>TOM1</italic> leads to nuclear retention of mRNA in an Mlp1p and Mlp2p dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Iglesias et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Mlp1p and Mlp2p compose the elongated fiber-like structures of the nuclear basket (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Strambio-de-Castillia et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Niepel et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Kim et al., 2018</xref>). The N-termini of these proteins are anchored to the nuclear pore, and their C-termini extend roughly 300 nm into the nuclear interior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bangs et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Kim et al., 2018</xref>). In addition to the purported roles in retaining immature RNAs in the nucleus, Mlp1p and TPR have been implicated in mRNA export in <italic>S. pombe</italic>, <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, and mammalian cells as perturbations of these proteins result in the accumulation of poly(A)+ RNA in the nucleus and/or defects in export of specific mRNAs to the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Aksenova et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bae et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Bhat et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Lee et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Li et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Shibata et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Umlauf et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Xu et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Zuckerman et al., 2020</xref>). Indeed, rapid depletion of TPR and NXF1 results in similar mRNA export defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Aksenova et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Zuckerman et al., 2020</xref>), supporting an mRNA export role for TPR, which microscopy implies functions in mRNA docking to the NPC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Aksenova et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Lee et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Li et al., 2021</xref>). Consistent with a role in mRNA export, Mlp1p/2p/TPR interact not only with the mRNA export adapters Nab2p and Yra1p but also Npl3p and the TREX-2 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Ashkenazy-Titelman et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Fasken et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Green et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Vinciguerra et al., 2005</xref>). However, Mlp1p/TPR may not play a general role in mRNA export, because in budding yeast <italic>MLP1</italic> is not essential for growth or mRNA export (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bangs et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Green et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Kosova et al., 2000</xref>), and in mammals TPR is only required to export a subset of poly(A)+ mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Umlauf et al., 2013</xref>) that are short, intron poor, or GC poor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Lee et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Zuckerman et al., 2020</xref>). The lack of a general role for Mlp1p and Mlp2p in mRNA export has suggested a broader role for Mlp1p and its orthologs in nuclear retention of immature substrates, but the role of Mlp1p in both export and retention remains under investigation.</p>
<p>In this work, we have gained a unique perspective into the role of Mlp1p in mRNA export and quality control through an investigation of the export pathway for discarded lariat intermediates, in budding yeast where export studies are not complicated by open mitosis. We found that, like the export of mRNA, the export of discarded, lariat intermediates require the export receptor Mex67p and three of its adapters, Yra1p, Nab2p, and Npl3p. Unlike mRNA export, lariat intermediate export requires Mlp1p and an interaction between Mlp1p and Nab2p. Further, lariat intermediate export required, even at permissive temperature, Tom1p-mediated ubiquitylation of Yra1p. Unexpectedly, our data argue against a general role for Mlp1p in quality control through nuclear retention of immature RNAs and instead highlight a role for Mlp1p in exporting immature RNAs. Specifically, our data suggest a model in which the export of lariat intermediates first requires docking onto the nuclear basket and then undocking to permit transit through the nuclear pore, a pathway that likely also operates in the case of mRNA export but in a manner that is normally masked by redundant pathways.</p>

<title>Export of lariat intermediates requires the mRNA export factor Mex67p</title>
<p>To investigate the mechanism of lariat intermediate export in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, we tested whether the canonical mRNA export factor Mex67p is required, given that the association of its adapters on a transcript initiates co-transcriptionally. First, to observe the subcellular localization of lariat intermediates, we utilized a <italic>lacZ</italic>-expressing <italic>ACT1</italic> export reporter that includes a branch site (br) A-to-G mutation and thus accumulates lariat intermediates that localize to the cytoplasm, based on indirect assays (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A, B</xref></bold>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Mayas et al., 2010</xref>). To define the subcellular localization of reporters directly, we targeted the <italic>lacZ</italic> gene in the 3’ exon of the derived reporter, named brG, and the wild-type control, named brA, for smRNA FISH. To resolve individual foci and thereby allow accurate, subcellular RNA counting, we modified the reporter by replacing its strong promoter with the weak <italic>pSTE5</italic> promoter. Consistent with previous indirect assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Mayas et al., 2010</xref>), in a wild-type strain at 30 °C the vast majority of the brG reporter localized to the cytoplasm, as for the brA reporter, with only a minor fraction in the nucleus (17% ±1% (SEM) and 17% ±1%, respectively; <bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref></bold>). By primer extension analysis, the brG mutation increases lariat intermediate levels by 7-fold (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref></bold>); although the mutation also increases pre-mRNA levels by 2-fold, the pre-mRNA represents only 33% of all brG species (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref></bold>), which is insufficient to account for the magnitude of the cytoplasmic signal from the brG reporter (83%), and a different reporter that accumulates lariat intermediate exclusively also localizes to the cytoplasm by smRNA FISH (see below). These data provide direct evidence for the nuclear export of lariat intermediates.</p>

<p>Next, we used smRNA FISH and RNA FISH to examine whether the export of lariat intermediates required Mex67p. Indeed, in a temperature-sensitive <italic>mex67-5</italic> mutant that blocks mRNA export at the non-permissive temperature of 37 °C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Segref et al., 1997</xref>), both the brG and brA reporters accumulated in the nucleus after a temperature shift to 37 °C (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>; <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1A, B</xref></bold>). Specifically, by smRNA FISH, the localization of the brG reporter in the nuclei of <italic>mex67-5</italic> cells increased 3.9-fold from 19% ±1% to 74% ±2%, paralleling a 4.0-fold increase in brA-derived mRNAs from 18% ±1% to 71% ±3% (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref></bold>); by RNA FISH, the localization of the brG reporter, like poly(A)+ RNA, increased similarly in nuclei (<bold><xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1B</xref></bold>). In contrast, a shift of wild-type <italic>MEX67</italic> cells did not significantly increase localization of the brG reporter in the nucleus (16% ±1% at 37 °C compared to 17% ±1% at 30 °C), as for brA-derived mRNA and poly(A)+ RNA (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>; <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1B</xref></bold>). In contrast with the <italic>mex67-5</italic> mutant, the tRNA export mutant <italic>los1Δ</italic> did not affect the cytoplasmic localization of the brG reporter, indicating that the export of lariat intermediates is not promiscuous and requires a specific export pathway (<bold><xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1C</xref></bold>). Together, our results indicate that the export of lariat intermediates requires the general mRNA export factor Mex67p.</p>
<p>To test whether Mex67p interacts with lariat intermediates directly, we assayed for the interaction of Mex67p with lariat intermediates <italic>in vivo</italic>. We performed RNA co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) from extracts of <italic>MEX67-GFP</italic> cells expressing the brG reporter and found that Mex67p-GFP did co-immunoprecipitate lariat intermediates (<bold><xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1D</xref></bold>). To rule out that the interaction formed <italic>in vitro</italic>, we pre-mixed untagged <italic>MEX67</italic> cells and TAP-tagged <italic>MEX67</italic> cells, lysed the cell mixture, and then performed RNA co-IP. When we expressed the reporter in the tagged cells, we again observed co-immunoprecipitation of lariat intermediates with tagged <italic>MEX67</italic>, but when we expressed the brG reporter in the untagged cells, we did not observe co-immunoprecipitation (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref></bold>); by contrast, endogenous <italic>RPL21a</italic> mRNA co-immunoprecipitated with tagged <italic>MEX67</italic> in either condition. These data verify that Mex67p interacts with lariat intermediates <italic>in vivo</italic> and support a direct role for Mex67p in lariat intermediate export.</p>

<title>Export of lariat intermediates requires Mex67p export adaptors</title>
<p>In budding yeast, Mex67p is recruited to mRNA transcripts by three different export adaptors, Yra1p, Nab2p, and/or Npl3p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Gilbert and Guthrie, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Hurt et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Iglesias et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Zenklusen et al., 2001</xref>). Therefore, we tested whether any of these adaptors is required for the export of lariat intermediates. First, to test for the requirement of Yra1p in the export of lariat intermediates, we tested whether the temperature-sensitive <italic>GFP-yra1-8</italic> mutant, which blocks mRNA export at 37 °C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Zenklusen et al., 2002</xref>), disrupts the export of lariat intermediates at 37 °C. Specifically, we transformed the brG and brA reporters into <italic>GFP-yra1-8</italic> cells, shifted the cells to 37 °C, and then assessed the cellular localization of the reporters by smRNA FISH. As for the nuclear levels of the brA reporter, the nuclear levels of the brG reporter did not increase in the control, wild-type <italic>YRA1</italic> cells, but they did increase 2.6-fold in the <italic>GFP-yra1-8</italic> cells, from 28% ±1% to 72% ±4% (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A, B</xref></bold>), thereby establishing evidence that the export of lariat intermediates requires Yra1p. To test whether lariat intermediates interact directly with Yra1p, we expressed the brG reporter in <italic>HA-YRA1</italic> cells, formaldehyde crosslinked the cells, performed denaturing RNA co-IP from extracts, and then assayed for RNA by RT-qPCR using primers specifically targeting lariat intermediates. Indeed, HA-Yra1p not only co-immunoprecipitated endogenous <italic>RPL21a</italic> mRNA, as expected, but also brG-derived lariat intermediates (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref></bold>). These data support a direct role for Yra1p in the export of lariat intermediates.</p>

<p>Next, to test for a requirement of Nab2p in the export of lariat intermediates, we assessed by smRNA FISH whether the export of the brG reporter was compromised in a cold-sensitive <italic>nab2-ΔN</italic> mutant, which accumulates poly(A)+ RNA in the nucleus at 16 °C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Marfatia et al., 2003</xref>). Indeed, when <italic>nab2-ΔN</italic> cells expressing the reporters were shifted to 16 °C, the nuclear levels of the brG reporter increased 1.5-fold from 35% ±4% to 52% ±3%, similar to the increase of 1.5-fold from 32% ±2% to 47% ±2% for the brA reporter (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D, E</xref></bold>), suggesting that Nab2p is also required for the export of lariat intermediates. To test whether Nab2p interacts directly with lariat intermediates, we expressed the brG reporter in HTB-tagged <italic>NAB2-HTB</italic> cells, UV-crosslinked the cells, performed denaturing RNA pull-down from extracts, and then assayed for associated RNAs by RT-qPCR. Indeed, Nab2p-HTB not only pulled down <italic>RPL21a</italic> mRNA in a UV-dependent manner, as expected, but also brG-derived lariat intermediate (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2F</xref></bold>). These data support a direct role for Nab2p in the export of lariat intermediates.</p>
<p>Finally, to examine whether Npl3p plays a role in the export of lariat intermediates, we tested whether a temperature-sensitive <italic>npl3-1</italic> mutant, which displays a strong defect in mRNA export after a shift to 37 °C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Lee et al., 1996</xref>), blocks the export of lariat intermediates. After a shift from 25 °C to 37 °C for 2 hours, the nuclear localization of the brG reporter in the <italic>npl3-1</italic> cells increased 2.6-fold from 24% ±3% to 63% ±4%, similar to the increase of 1.8-fold from 33% ±2% to 60% ±3% for the brA reporter (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2G, H</xref></bold>). Unfortunately, an Npl3-TAP co-IP was unsuccessful, so we were unable to confirm direct binding to the brG reporter. Nevertheless, these data suggest that, like Yra1p and Nab2p, Npl3p contributes to the export of lariat intermediates. Taken together, these results establish evidence that the export of lariat intermediates requires Mex67p and its adaptors and therefore the canonical mRNA export pathway.</p>

<title>Efficient export of lariat intermediates requires the nuclear basket component Mlp1p</title>
<p>Because previous studies have determined that Nab2p physically interacts with the nuclear basket factor Mlp1p and that the <italic>nab2-ΔN</italic> mutant lacks the Mlp1p-interacting domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Marfatia et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Grant et al., 2008</xref>), we hypothesized that Nab2p mediates lariat intermediate export through its interaction with Mlp1p, even though Mlp1p has been implicated as a quality-control factor that retains immature RNPs in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Bonnet and Palancade, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Galy et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Vinciguerra et al., 2005</xref>). As a first test of this hypothesis, we assayed whether the export of the brG reporter requires Mlp1p. To assay export efficiency, we used our previously described <italic>lacZ</italic>-based export reporter having an internal ribosomal entry site (IRES) in the second exon just upstream of <italic>lacZ</italic>, which enables the translation of exported species, whether a pre-mRNA, lariat intermediate, or mRNA species (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref></bold>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Mayas et al., 2010</xref>). Indeed, deletion of <italic>MLP1</italic> significantly reduced the β-galactosidase activity of the brG-IRES reporter by 50%; by contrast deletion of <italic>MLP1</italic> did not significantly affect the β-galactosidase activity of the brA-IRES reporter (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref></bold>). This reduced β-galactosidase activity in <italic>mlp1Δ</italic> cells cannot be accounted for by changes in RNA levels, which were not perturbed (<bold><xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2B, C</xref></bold>). Similarly, in <italic>mlp1Δ</italic> cells a G1a reporter that accumulates lariat intermediates showed reduced β-galactosidase activity (<bold><xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2B, C, D</xref></bold>). These data are consistent with a requirement for Mlp1p in the export of lariat intermediates (see below).</p>

<p>To determine directly whether <italic>MLP1</italic> promotes the export of the brG reporter, we used smRNA FISH to examine the cellular localization of the reporter in <italic>mlp1Δ</italic> cells. Consistent with our findings by the β-galactosidase assay, the <italic>mlp1Δ</italic> mutation decreased the cytoplasmic signal and concomitantly increased the nuclear signal of the brG reporter; the nuclear fraction increased by 1.8-fold – from 27% ±1% in wild-type <italic>MLP1</italic> cells to 50% ±2% in <italic>mlp1Δ</italic> cells (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref></bold>). By contrast, the <italic>mlp1Δ</italic> mutation did not impact the subcellular localization of the brA reporter (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref></bold>). These data verify directly that <italic>MLP1</italic> promotes the export of the brG reporter, and the data are consistent with a role for Mlp1p in the export of lariat intermediates.</p>
<p>Because the brG reporter accumulates some pre-mRNA (38%), in addition to lariat intermediate (58%; <bold><xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2B, C</xref></bold>) and the <italic>mlp1Δ</italic> mutant only partially compromised export of the brG reporter (by 50%; <bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref></bold>), we tested whether the dependence of the brG reporter on Mlp1p might reflect a dependence of the export pre-mRNA export, instead of lariat intermediate, on Mlp1p. To test this possibility, we assessed the impact of the <italic>mlp1Δ</italic> mutation on the export of an isogenic reporter having a G1c mutation at the 5’ splice site, a mutation that accumulates similar levels of pre-mRNA (2.4-fold increased, relative to wild type; <bold><xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2B, C</xref></bold>) but no lariat intermediate; in fact, the levels of lariat intermediate are even lower than for a wild-type reporter (<bold><xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2B</xref></bold>). Significantly, the <italic>mlp1Δ</italic> mutation did not reduce the levels of β-galactosidase expressed from the G1c reporter, relative to the wild-type strain (<bold><xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2E</xref>)</bold>. Similarly, in <italic>mlp1Δ</italic> cells, a brC reporter that similarly accumulates pre-mRNA but not lariat intermediate did not reduce β-galactosidase activity (<bold><xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2B, C, E</xref></bold>). These data provide strong evidence that the export of brG pre-mRNA is not dependent on Mlp1p; these data, therefore, imply that the efficient export of brG lariat intermediates is dependent on Mlp1p.</p>
<p>To test for a requirement for Mlp1p in the export of lariat intermediates explicitly, we assessed the impact of the <italic>mlp1Δ</italic> mutation on the export of an isogenic reporter having a UAc mutation at the 3’ splice site. Like the brG mutation, the UAc mutation compromises exon ligation; unlike the brG mutation, the UAc mutation does not substantially compromise the conversion of pre-mRNA to lariat intermediate, so UAc pre-mRNA levels are insignificant (e.g., <bold><xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3A</xref></bold>). However, whereas the brG lariat intermediate, having a non-consensus branch linkage, is resistant to debranching by Dbr1 and to subsequent turnover, the UAc lariat intermediate, with a consensus branch linkage, is subject to rapid debranching and turnover. Nevertheless, in a <italic>dbr1Δ</italic> strain the UAc lariat intermediate is stabilized (e.g., 4-fold in <bold><xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3A, B</xref></bold>), and this stabilized lariat intermediate is efficiently translated in the cytoplasm, as we have shown previously (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref></bold>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Mayas et al., 2010</xref>). Thus, we tested in a <italic>dbr1Δ</italic> background whether the export of the UAc lariat intermediate requires <italic>MLP1</italic> for export. Indeed, the <italic>mlp1Δ</italic> mutation compromised export; specifically, whereas the <italic>mlp1Δ</italic> mutation did not significantly reduce the β-galactosidase activity of the brA-IRES reporter, the <italic>mlp1Δ</italic> mutation reduced the β-galactosidase activity of the UAc-IRES reporter by roughly 40% (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref></bold>), similar to the brG reporter (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref></bold>). Even in the wild-type <italic>DBR1</italic> strain, where low levels of UAc-IRES lariat intermediate accumulates relative to the brA-IRES control (<bold><xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3A, B</xref>)</bold>, we detected a similar decrease in β-galactosidase activity for the UAc-but not the brA-IRES reporter (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref></bold>). These data provide compelling evidence that <italic>MLP1</italic> is required explicitly and specifically for the efficient export of lariat intermediates.</p>
<p>To test directly for a requirement for <italic>MLP1</italic> in the export of the UAc lariat intermediates, we assayed for localization of the UAc reporter in the <italic>dbr1Δ</italic> background by smRNA FISH. Whereas the <italic>mlp1Δ</italic> mutation did not impact the subcellular localization of the brA reporter, the <italic>mlp1Δ</italic> mutation did shift the localization of the UAc reporter from the cytoplasm to the nucleus; specifically, we observed a shift in the nuclear fraction from 33% ±2% to 45% ±3% (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E</xref></bold>), similar to the shift of the brG reporter in a <italic>DBR1</italic> background (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref></bold>); by contrast, the <italic>mlp1Δ</italic> mutation did not shift the localization of the brA reporter from the cytoplasm to the nucleus (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E</xref></bold>). These data provide direct evidence for a specific requirement for <italic>MLP1</italic> in efficient lariat intermediate export.</p>

<title>Export of lariat intermediates requires an interaction between Nab2p and Mlp1p</title>
<p>As a further test of our hypothesis that Nab2p mediates lariat intermediate export through its interaction with Mlp1p, we probed more deeply for a requirement for the Nab2p-Mlp1p interface in the export of lariat intermediates. First, we tested for a requirement for the Mlp1p component of the interface utilizing the <italic>mlp1-Δ1586-1768</italic> mutation, which lacks the Nab2p-interacting domain. This mutation compromised the β-galactosidase activity of the brG-IRES reporter; specifically, whereas expression of wild-type <italic>MLP1</italic> in <italic>mlp1Δ</italic> cells fully rescued the β-galactosidase activity of the brG-IRES reporter, relative to <italic>mlp1Δ</italic> cells with a vector control, expression of <italic>mlp1-Δ1586-1768</italic> failed to rescue (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref></bold>).

<p>We showed above that the cold-sensitive <italic>nab2-ΔN</italic> mutant, which lacks the Mlp1p-interacting domain, compromises the export of the brG reporter at a low temperature (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D, E</xref></bold>), but this mutant also compromised the export of the brA reporter (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D, E</xref></bold>), in addition to poly(A)+ RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Grant et al., 2008</xref>) – phenotypes that do not parallel the phenotypes of <italic>mlp1</italic> mutants, so we next assayed whether lariat intermediate export was sensitive to a subtler <italic>NAB2</italic> double mutant, <italic>nab2-F72A/F73A</italic>, that also disrupts the Nab2p-Mlp1p interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Fasken et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Grant et al., 2008</xref>) but displays no growth defect at any temperature (<bold><xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Fig. S4B</xref></bold>). Indeed, although the <italic>nab2-F72A/F73A</italic> mutation did not significantly affect the β-galactosidase activity of the brA-IRES reporter, the <italic>nab2-F72A/F73A</italic> mutation did reduce the β-galactosidase activity of the brG-IRES reporter by 60% (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref></bold>), quantitatively similar to the reduction of β-galactosidase activity observed for <italic>mlp1Δ</italic> or <italic>mlp1-Δ1586-1768</italic> mutant cells (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref></bold>; <bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref></bold>). The diminished β-galactosidase activity of the brG <italic>lacZ</italic> reporter in <italic>nab2-F72A/F73A</italic> cells did not result from changes in RNA levels, because the <italic>nab2-F72A/F73A</italic> mutant did not alter RNA levels of either reporter (<bold><xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Fig. S4C, D</xref></bold>). These data are also consistent with the hypothesis that efficient lariat intermediate export requires the interaction between Nab2p and Mlp1p.</p>

As in <italic>mlp1Δ</italic> cells (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref></bold>), in <italic>nab2-F72A/F73A</italic> cells the nuclear fraction of the brG reporter increased by 2.1-fold, from 23% ±3% in wild-type <italic>NAB2</italic> cells to 48% ±4% in <italic>nab2-F72A/F73A</italic> cells, whereas the nuclear fraction of the brA reporter did not increase significantly (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref></bold>). Together, these results establish that the export of lariat intermediates, in particular, requires the interaction between Nab2p and Mlp1p.</p>

<title>Export of lariat intermediates requires Tom1p-mediated ubiquitylation of Yra1p</title>
<p>Yra1p is ubiquitylated by the E3 ligase Tom1p, and this ubiquitylation is required for efficient poly(A)+ mRNA export at a higher temperature (37 °C; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Iglesias et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Duncan et al., 2000</xref>). Additionally, based on genetic interactions of Tom1p or Yra1p with Mlp1p or Mlp2p, Tom1p has been proposed to surveil mRNAs for maturity at the nuclear basket (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Iglesias et al., 2010</xref>). Thus, we investigated the impact of Tom1p on lariat intermediate export. First, we assayed for the consequences of deleting <italic>TOM1</italic> on the export of the brA- and brG-IRES reporters. At the permissive temperature (30 °C), whereas the <italic>tom1Δ</italic> mutation did not significantly reduce the β-galactosidase activity of the brA-IRES reporter, the deletion mutation did significantly reduce the activity of the brG-IRES reporter (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref></bold>), suggesting unexpectedly that <italic>TOM1, like MLP1,</italic> promotes, rather than antagonizes, the export of incompletely processed mRNPs; furthermore, our data imply that Tom1p, like Mlp1p and its interaction with Nab2p (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref></bold>; <bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref></bold>), is particularly important for the export of incompletely processed mRNPs.</p>

<p>Given this evidence that Tom1p is required specifically for the export of the brG-IRES reporter at the permissive temperature, we next tested whether ubiquitylation of the Tom1p target Yra1p is also required, exploiting the mutant <italic>yra1-KR-all</italic>, which mutates all potential ubiquitylation sites and precludes Tom1p-mediated ubiquitylation. At the semi-permissive temperature of 25 °C, the <italic>yra1-KR-all</italic> mutation reduced the β-galactosidase activity of the brA reporter but by a modest degree (20%; <bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref></bold>), in contrast with the <italic>mlp1Δ, nab2-F72AF73A</italic>, and <italic>tom1Δ</italic> mutants (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref></bold>; <bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B,C</xref></bold>; <bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref></bold>); this reduction may reflect the growth defect of this strain at 25 °C and/or the mutation of all lysines, which are not all functional targets for Tom1p (<bold><xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Fig. S5</xref></bold>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Iglesias et al., 2010</xref>). The <italic>yra1-KR-all</italic> mutation reduced the β-galactosidase activity of the brG-IRES reporter by a greater degree (52%; <bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref></bold>). Notably, the <italic>mlp1Δ</italic>, <italic>nab2-F72A/F73A, tom1Δ</italic>, and <italic>yra1-KR-all</italic> mutants all reduced the β-galactosidase activity of the brG-IRES reporter by a similar degree, roughly 50% (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref></bold>; <bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref></bold>; <bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A, B</xref></bold>), suggesting that Nab2p, Mlp1p, Tom1p, and Yra1p act in the same pathway.</p>
<p>Because Tom1p-mediated ubiquitylation of Yra1p promotes dissociation of Yra1p from its bound mRNPs before nuclear exit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Iglesias et al., 2010</xref>), we examined whether Yra1p ubiquitylation modulated the association of Yra1p with lariat intermediates, as documented in <bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref></bold>, at 25 °C. By formaldehyde cross-linking followed by RNA co-IP using HA-tagged Yra1p, the <italic>yra1-KR-all</italic> mutation increased binding, as expected, to a control mRNA (<italic>RPL21A</italic>) by 1.5-fold; significantly, the <italic>yra1-KR-all</italic> mutation increased binding to the brG lariat intermediate by 3.2-fold (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref></bold>). These data support a role for Tom1p-mediated ubiquitylation of Yra1p in promoting the export of lariat intermediates through dissociation of Yra1p.</p>
<p>Although Tom1p-mediated ubiquitylation of Yra1p has been found to promote its dissociation from mRNP before nuclear exit, it is still not clear whether Tom1p functions before or after mRNPs dock onto the nuclear pores. Genetic evidence has suggested that Tom1p acts after mRNPs dock to the nuclear pores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Iglesias et al., 2010</xref>). However, live tracking of newly born mRNAs from an induced reporter implied that Tom1p promotes mRNP docking, suggesting that Tom1p acts before mRNP docking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Saroufim et al., 2015</xref>). To distinguish these two models, we first examined directly the localization of lariat intermediates and mRNAs. By smRNA FISH, after a temperature shift of <italic>tom1Δ</italic> to the non-permissive temperature of 37 °C, the brG reporter, as well as the brA reporter, localized primarily to the nucleus (78% ±2% and 82% ±2%, respectively), relative to the wild-type strain (35% ±2% and 30% ±1%, respectively; <bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D</xref></bold>); similarly, after a temperature shift of the <italic>yra1-KR-all</italic> strain to 37 °C, the brG reporter, as well as the brA reporter, localized primarily to the nucleus (68% ±3% and 74% ±3%, respectively), relative to the wild-type strain (32% ±2% and 34% ±3%, respectively; <bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5E</xref></bold>). These data indicate that at a non-permissive temperature of 37 °C, Tom1p-mediated ubiquitylation of Yra1p is required for the efficient export of not just mature poly(A)+ mRNA but also an immature RNA.</p>
<p>Together with the observation that <italic>MLP1</italic> and <italic>MLP2</italic> mutations suppress <italic>TOM1</italic> and <italic>YRA1</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Iglesias et al., 2010</xref>), our smRNA FISH results suggest that both brA-derived mRNAs and brG-derived lariat intermediates in <italic>tom1Δ</italic> and <italic>yra1-KR-all</italic> mutant cells are stalled on the nuclear periphery, likely at the nuclear basket (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D, E</xref></bold>). To test this idea, we examined whether deletion of the nuclear basket in the <italic>tom1Δ</italic> strain would rescue the export defect. Consistent with the previous genetic data that deletion of <italic>MLP2</italic> rescues the temperature sensitivity of the <italic>tom1Δ</italic> strain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Iglesias et al., 2010</xref>), deletion of <italic>MLP2</italic> in the <italic>tom1Δ</italic> strain substantially rescued the export defect of the brA reporter, reducing nuclear localization from 82% ±2% to 55% ±2% and increasing cytoplasmic localization by 2.5-fold (<italic>p</italic>-value=2.2×10<sup>-16</sup>; <bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5F</xref></bold>); similarly, deletion of <italic>MLP1</italic> in the <italic>tom1Δ</italic> strain modestly but significantly reduced nuclear localization from 82% ±2% to 74% ±2% and increased cytoplasmic localization by 1.4-fold (<italic>p</italic>-value=8.6×10<sup>-4</sup>; <bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5F</xref></bold>). Interestingly, deletion of <italic>MLP2</italic> but not <italic>MLP1</italic> in the <italic>tom1Δ</italic> strain also slightly but significantly rescued the export defect of the brG reporter, reducing nuclear localization from 78% ±2% to 68% ±3% and increasing cytoplasmic localization by 1.5-fold (<italic>p</italic>-value=0.003; <bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5F</xref></bold>). The smaller increase of the brG reporter in the cytoplasm is consistent with an essential requirement of Mlp1p, if not also Mlp2p, in exporting lariat intermediates but not mRNAs. These results indicate that Mlp1p, and to a lesser degree Mlp2p, do not retain incompletely processed lariat intermediates in the nucleus but instead promote the export of such species. Indeed, together these data support a model in which Mlp1p and Mlp2p promote the export of lariat intermediates by facilitating docking at the nuclear basket and then Tom1p-mediated ubiquitylation of Yra1p promotes undocking, rather than docking, and thereby nuclear pore entry.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this work, using a combination of ensemble and single molecule approaches, we discovered that the export of spliceosome-discarded lariat intermediates requires the general export receptor Mex67p (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref></bold>) and three of its adaptors, Yra1p, Nab2p, and Npl3p (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref></bold>). These data establish that lariat intermediates utilize the same export machinery as mRNAs. Unexpectedly, we found that the purported quality control factor Mlp1p did not retain lariat intermediates in the nucleus but instead promoted the export of lariat intermediates and did so through its interaction with the export adaptor Nab2p (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref></bold>; <bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref></bold>), implying a role for the nuclear basket in recruiting lariat intermediates to the NPC. Further, the export of lariat intermediates also relies on the E3 ubiquitin ligase Tom1p and its target sites in Yra1p (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref></bold>). Importantly, our findings imply that Tom1-mediated ubiquitylation of Yra1p undocks lariat intermediates from the nuclear basket of the NPC, allowing not only lariat intermediates but also mRNAs to transit through the NPC. Together, our results challenge a general role for Mlp1p in the quality control of mRNA export and implicate novel steps of mRNA export at the nuclear basket.</p>
<p>Our results establish that the general mRNA export pathway transports discarded lariat intermediates into the cytoplasm. Given that the mRNA export machinery assembles co-transcriptionally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Wende et al., 2019</xref>), it is likely that lariat intermediates are already export-competent when they are discarded by the spliceosome and thereby export by default. Our data further implicate the mRNA export pathway as a means for turning over RNA substrates discarded by the spliceosome. Indeed, a range of suboptimal pre-mRNAs and splicing intermediates are exported to the cytoplasm for degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Harigaya and Parker, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Hilleren and Parker, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Legrain and Rosbash, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Mayas et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Sayani and Chanfreau, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Talhouarne and Gall, 2018</xref>); paralleling our own findings, the export of a fraction of pre-mRNA that accumulates upon pharmacological inhibition of the splicing factor SF3b1 requires the Yra1p human ortholog ALYREF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Carvalho et al., 2017</xref>). Such nuclear export may ensure that once substrates are discarded by the spliceosome, they are never engaged by the spliceosome again. Future work is needed to further understand the interplay between nuclear export and splicing proofreading.</p>
<p>Together with previous evidence of the export of unspliced pre-mRNAs and lariat intermediates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Carvalho et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Harigaya and Parker, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Hilleren and Parker, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Legrain and Rosbash, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Mayas et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Sayani and Chanfreau, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Talhouarne and Gall, 2018</xref>), our results presented here question a general role for Mlp1p in retaining immature mRNPs in the nucleus. Similarly, a genome-wide study assaying the export of pre-mRNA expressed from endogenous genes rather than reporters found no evidence that Mlp1p acts as a general retention factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Sayani and Chanfreau, 2012</xref>). Further, recent studies indicate a positive role for TPR in mammals in promoting the export of a subset of mature mRNAs that are short, intron poor, or GC poor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Lee et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Umlauf et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Zuckerman et al., 2020</xref>). We note that in two studies providing some evidence for a role for TPR in nuclear retention, TPR knockdown increased total RNA levels of the reporter and, where analyzed, in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Coyle et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Rajanala and Nandicoori, 2012</xref>), suggesting the possibility that TPR knockdown does not increase the export of nuclear RNAs but rather increases nuclear RNA levels and thereby indirectly leads to increased cytoplasmic levels. Indeed, TPR knockdown can impact nuclear and cytoplasmic RNA reporter levels without impacting overall, steady-state TPR levels and instead only affecting new TPR protein synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Coyle et al., 2011</xref>), and even rapid depletion of TPR impacts the transcription of genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Aksenova et al., 2020</xref>). By contrast, in our study, deletion of <italic>MLP1</italic> does not alter levels of pre-mRNA, lariat intermediate, or mRNA (<bold><xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2B, C</xref>; <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3</xref></bold>), and we provide evidence that the impact of <italic>MLP1</italic> on lariat intermediate export reflects specifically an interaction between the C-terminus of Mlp1p and the Mlp1p-interacting domain of the mRNA export adapter Nab2p (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref></bold>), together providing support for a direct role for Mlp1p in exporting lariat intermediates. Given that a <italic>pml39Δ</italic> mutant phenocopies the retention defects of an <italic>mlp1Δ</italic> mutant and that Mlp1p is required for the localization of Pml39p to the nuclear basket (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Palancade et al., 2005</xref>), it is formally possible that Pml39p instead of or in addition to Mlp1p plays a direct role in the export of lariat intermediates; however, Pml39p is also reciprocally required for the localization of Mlp1p to the nuclear basked, and Pml39p is not known to interact with Nab2p or with any other protein factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Gunkel et al., 2023</xref>).</p>
<p>While both mRNAs and lariat intermediates require the general export pathway (Mex67p and its adapters; <bold>Figs. <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></bold>), only lariat intermediates seemingly require Mlp1p (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref></bold>). These results raise two possibilities: 1) Mlp1p functions specifically in the lariat intermediate export pathway, or 2) Mlp1p functions in both pathways but its role in mRNA export is masked by functional redundancy in the mRNA export pathway. The second possibility is more consistent with previous findings, which found Mlp1p and its orthologs promote mRNA export in a number of organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Aksenova et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bae et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Lee et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Li et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Shibata et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Umlauf et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Xu et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Zuckerman et al., 2020</xref>). Considering that multiple interactions form between an exporting mRNA and the NPC, we reason that, in <italic>mlp1Δ</italic> cells, other functionally redundant factors compensate for the loss of Mlp1p to ensure mRNA export. Therefore, the loss of one interaction, such as deletion of <italic>MLP1</italic>, is unlikely to grossly affect mRNA export in budding yeast. By contrast, the lariat intermediate does not have a 5’ cap, which facilitates mRNA export (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Ashkenazy-Titelman et al., 2020</xref>), thus potentially rendering the export of this suboptimal export substrate more sensitive to disruptions, such as deletion of <italic>MLP1</italic>. Consistent with the idea that suboptimal export substrates may be more dependent on Mlp1p, the export of short, intron poor, or GC poor transcripts are dependent on TPR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Lee et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Umlauf et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Zuckerman et al., 2020</xref>). Suggesting a role for <italic>MLP1/2</italic> in docking mRNA at the nuclear basket, as well as a role for Tom1p in undocking mRNA (see below), we found that when <italic>TOM1</italic> is deleted mRNA is retained in the nucleus in an <italic>MLP1-</italic> and <italic>MLP2</italic>-dependent manner (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref></bold>; see below). Additionally, <italic>MLP1</italic> extends the residency time of mRNAs at the NPC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Saroufim et al., 2015</xref>). Further, TPR promotes engagement of mRNA with the nuclear basket (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Li et al., 2021</xref>), potentially by recruiting mRNA via the TREX-2 component GANP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Aksenova et al., 2020</xref>). Lastly, the export of Balbiani ring RNPs in <italic>Chironomus</italic> begins with engagement of the ring of the nuclear basket (Wurtz-T et al., 1996), where the C-terminus of Mlp1p, the Nab2p-interacting domain in budding yeast, resides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Akey et al., 2022</xref>).</p>
<p>Notably, an exporting mRNA first docks to the nuclear basket of the NPC in an Mlp1p/TPR-dependent manner and then somehow transitions to engage the FG-repeat containing NUP153 deeper in the nuclear basket before entering the central channel of the NPC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Li et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Saroufim et al., 2015</xref>). Our results suggest that Tom1p undocks exporting mRNAs from the Mlp1/2p and TPR components of the nuclear basket by ubiquitylating Yra1p. First, we and others have shown by RNA FISH that <italic>tom1Δ</italic> cells accumulate mRNA in the nucleus (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref></bold>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Iglesias et al., 2010</xref>). Importantly, consistent with previous genetic evidence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Iglesias et al., 2010</xref>), we show directly that deletion of <italic>MLP1</italic> or especially <italic>MLP2</italic> rescues this export defect of mRNA in <italic>tom1Δ</italic> cells (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref></bold>). Given that Mlp1p and Mlp2p are subunits of the nuclear basket, these results imply that Tom1p acts at the nuclear basket, and that deletion of <italic>MLP2</italic> in particular renders Tom1p-mediated undocking unnecessary by bypassing mRNA docking to the nuclear basket. This view of a role for Mlp1/2p in docking and a role for Tom1p in undocking, provides an alternative to the view that Mlp1/2p and TPR perform quality control functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Iglesias et al., 2010</xref>). As noted above, our data suggest that the nuclear basket can provide an essential docking role in export, as in the case of lariat intermediates, and that this role is redundant for other cargos, as in the case of our mRNA and pre-mRNA reporters; in the case of short, intron-poor, or GC-poor mRNAs, which require TPR for export (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Lee et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Umlauf et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Zuckerman et al., 2020</xref>), such redundancy may be lacking. Most importantly, whether or not docking is essential, our data suggest that once cargo is docked, undocking is essential, rationalizing nuclear accumulation of both lariat intermediate and mRNA in <italic>tom1Δ</italic> or <italic>yra1-KR-all</italic> cells (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D, E</xref></bold>). This view would indicate that previous data suggesting the popular interpretation that the nuclear basket serves as a checkpoint (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Coyle et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Galy et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Palancade et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Rajanala and Nandicoori, 2012</xref>) instead imply that unspliced pre-mRNA at the nuclear basket is simply stuck on the mRNA export pathway and unable to undergo undocking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Bonnet and Palancade, 2015</xref>), as our evidence suggests for mRNA in the <italic>tom1Δ</italic> and <italic>yra1-KR-all</italic> mutants (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D, E</xref></bold>), and that deletion of <italic>MLP1</italic> or <italic>MLP2</italic> or depletion of TPR simply bypasses the requirement for undocking, as we observe for mRNA in the <italic>mlp1Δ</italic> or <italic>mlp2Δ</italic> mutants (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5F</xref></bold>).</p>
<p>Collectively, our data suggest a model, in which lariat intermediates first dock onto the nuclear basket, requiring at least the interaction between Mlp1p and Nab2. Then, Tom1p is somehow activated to ubiquitylate Yra1 to undock lariat intermediates from the nuclear basket, allowing them to transit through the NPC, a pathway that likely also operates in mRNA export but in a manner that is normally masked by redundant pathways.</p>

<p>Yeast strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in <xref rid="tbls1" ref-type="table">table S1</xref> and <xref rid="tbls2" ref-type="table">S2</xref>. Yeast strains were constructed with exogenous copy present on a shuffle plasmid. Plasmids were made either using topo cloning and/or site-directed mutagenesis. <italic>pRS313-MLP1</italic> plasmid was generated by cloning <italic>MLP1</italic> locus (ORF with 500 bp flanking sequences) from the <italic>BY4741</italic> strain into <italic>pRS313</italic> empty vector. <italic>pRS313-mlp1-Δ1586-1768</italic> plasmid was generated by site directed mutagenesis of <italic>pRS313-MLP1</italic>. The NLS in <italic>pRS313-mlp1-Δ1586-1768</italic> is intact. GFP tagged <italic>MLP1</italic> plasmids (<italic>pRS313-MLP1-GFP</italic> and <italic>pRS313-mlp1-Δ1586-1768-GFP</italic>) were generated by inserting the enhanced monomeric GFP sequence immediately downstream of the penultimate amino acid in frame. <italic>pRS315-nab2-F72AF73A</italic> plasmid was generated by site-directed mutagenesis of <italic>pRS315-NAB2</italic> plasmid. <italic>pRS316-MEX67</italic> plasmid was generated by cloning <italic>MEX67</italic> locus (ORF with 500 bp flanking sequences) from the <italic>BY4741</italic> strain into <italic>pRS316</italic> empty vector. <italic>pRS313-MEX67</italic> was generated by subcloning <italic>MEX67</italic> from <italic>pRS316-MEX67</italic> to <italic>pRS313</italic>. <italic>mex67-5</italic> mutant was generated by site directed mutagenesis of <italic>pRS313-MEX67</italic>. Reporters used in FISH experiments were generated as followed. The <italic>lacZ</italic> reporters containing different mutations were subcloned from <italic>pRS426</italic> to <italic>pRS316</italic>. Then, the strong <italic>GPD</italic> promoter was replaced by a weak <italic>STE5</italic> promoter. <italic>MEX67</italic> strains were generated as followed. <italic>MEX67</italic> shuffle strain was generated by replacing the endogenous <italic>MEX67</italic> with <italic>HPHMX4</italic> in the <italic>BY4741</italic> strain expressing <italic>pRS316-MEX67</italic>. <italic>MEX67</italic> shuffle strain was conferred by PCR and 5-FOA selection. Afterward, <italic>pRS316-MEX67</italic> in the <italic>MEX67</italic> shuffle strain was replaced by either <italic>pRS313-MEX67</italic> or <italic>pRS313-mex67-5</italic>, generating the final <italic>MEX67</italic> strain or <italic>mex67-5</italic> strain. Similar strategy was applied to generate <italic>mlp1Δ dbr1Δ</italic> strain from <italic>dbr1Δ</italic> strain, <italic>mlp1Δ tom1Δ</italic> strain from <italic>tom1Δ</italic>, and <italic>mlp2Δ tom2Δ</italic> strain from <italic>tom1Δ</italic> strain.</p>

Cells were imaged using Olympus IX81 inverted widefield microscope equipped with Hamamatsu Orca Flash 4.0 camera with 4 megapixels and 100x 1.45NA oil objective lens. Single RNA molecule counting was conducted using custom macros in imageJ and statistical analysis was conducted in R. 10% formamide was used for smRNA FISH experiments and 40% formamide was used for RNA-FISH experiments. For smRNA FISH, probes were designed by Biosearch targeting the <italic>lacZ</italic> portion of the reporters. For RNA-FISH, a single Cy3-labeled oligo-dT(50) probe was used to target polyA+ RNAs and a single Alexa488-labeled probe was used to target the brG reporter.</p>

<title>RNA co-immunoprecipitation</title>
<p>For Mex67-GFP RNA co-IP, cell lysates were prepared from <italic>MEX67-GFP</italic> cells expressing the brG reporter (pJPS1488) and incubated with beads pre-conjugated with either anti-GFP antibody or IgG. After a 2-hour incubation at 4 °C, beads were washed five times and put through RNA extractions using phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1, v/v). To ensure Mex67 binds lariat intermediates <italic>in vivo</italic>, tagged <italic>MEX67-TAP</italic> cells expressing the empty vector were mixed with untagged <italic>MEX67</italic> cells expressing the brG reporter. In parallel, tagged <italic>MEX67-TAP</italic> cells expressing the brG reporter were mixed with untagged <italic>MEX67</italic> cells expressing the empty vector. Lysates were then prepared from these mixed cells and incubated with IgG beads at 4 °C for 2 hours. After incubation, beads were washed five times. Bound <italic>MEX67</italic> containing mRNPs were released by TEV cleavage and put through RNA extractions using phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1, v/v). For Nab2-HTB denaturing RNA co-IP and HA-Yra1 denaturing RNA co-IP, cells were grown to OD600 of 0.6-0.8, cross-linked for 10 minutes by 3.7% formaldehyde, and quenched with glycine. Then, cell lysates were prepared using glass beads. Cell lysates were incubated with either Ni-NTA beads in the case of Nab2-HTB or anti-HA beads in the case HA-Yra1 at 4 °C for 2 hours. After incubation, beads were washed five times and put through RNA extractions using phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1, v/v). Lariat intermediates were assayed using lariat specific RT-PCR. mRNA of endogenous <italic>RPL21</italic> was assay by RT-PCR as an internal control.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this manuscript, Zeng and Staley provide a valuable analysis of the molecular requirements for the export of a reporter mRNA that contains a lariat structure at its 5' end in the budding yeast S. cerevisiae. The authors provide evidence that this is regulated by the main mRNA export machinery (Yra1, Mex67, Nab2, Npl3, Tom1, and Mlp1). Of note, Mlp1 has been mainly implicated in the nuclear retention of unspliced pre-mRNA (i.e. quality control), and relatively little has been done to investigate its role in mRNA export in budding yeast.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>There is relatively little information in the current literature about the nuclear export of splicing intermediates. This paper provides one of the first analyses of this process and dissects the molecular components that promote this form of RNA export. Overall, the strength of the data presented in the manuscript is solid. The paper is well written and the message is clear and of general interest to the mRNA community.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>There are three problems with the paper, although these are not major and likely would not affect the final model as most aspects of the molecular details are confirmed by multiple complementary assays.</p>
<p>(1) The brG reporter produces both unspliced pre-mRNA and a lariat-containing intermediate RNA. Based on the primer extension assay the authors claim that only 33% of the final product is in pre-mRNA form and that this &quot;is insufficient to account for the magnitude of the cytoplasmic signal from the brG reporter (83%)&quot;. Nevertheless, it is possible that primer extension is incomplete or that the lariat-containing RNA is inaccessible for smFISH. The authors could easily perform a dual smFISH experiment (similar to Adivarahan et l., Molecular Cell 2018) where exon 1 is labelled with probes of one color, and the region that overlaps the lariat-containing intermediate is labelled with probes of a second color. If the authors are correct, then one-third of the smFISH foci should have both labels and the rest would have only the second label. This would also confirm that the latter (i.e. the lariat-containing RNAs) are exported to the cytoplasm. Using this approach, the authors could then show that MLP1-depletion (or depletion of any of the other factors) affect(s) one pool of RNAs (i.e. those that are lariat-containing) but not the other (i.e. pre-mRNA). Including these experiments would make the evidence for their model more convincing.</p>
<p>(2) In some cases, the number of smFISH foci appears to change drastically depending on the genetic background. This could either be due to the stochastic nature of mRNA expression between cells or reflect real differences between the genetic backgrounds that could alter the interpretation of the other observations.</p>
<p>(3) The authors state in the discussion that &quot;the general mRNA export pathway transports discarded lariat intermediates into the cytoplasm&quot;. Although this appears to be the case for the reporters that are investigated in this paper, I don't think that the authors should make such a broad sweeping claim. It may be that some discarded lariat intermediates are exported to the cytoplasm while others are targeted for nuclear retention and/or decay.</p>

<p>In this report, Zeng and Staley have used an elegant combination of RNA imaging approaches (single molecule FISH), RNA co-immunoprecipitations, and translation reporters to characterize the factors and pathways involved in the nuclear export of splicing intermediates in budding yeast. Their study notably involves the use of specific reporter genes, which lead to the accumulation of pre-mRNA and lariat species, in a battery of mutants impacting mRNA export and quality control.</p>
<p>The authors convincingly demonstrate that mRNA species expressed from such reporters are exported to the cytoplasm in a manner depending on the canonical mRNA export machinery (Mex67 and its adaptors) and the nuclear pore complex (NPC) basket (Mlp1). Interestingly, they provide evidence that the export of splicing intermediates requires docking and subsequent undocking at the nuclear basket, a step possibly more critical than for regular mRNAs.</p>
<p>However, their assays do not always allow us to define whether the impacted mRNA species correspond to lariats and/or pre-mRNAs. This is all the more critical since their findings apparently contradict previous reports that supported a role for the nuclear basket in pre-mRNA quality control. These earlier studies, which were similarly based on the use of dedicated yet distinct reporters, had found that the nuclear basket subunit Mlp1, together with different cofactors, prevents the export of unspliced mRNA species. It would be important to clarify experimentally and discuss the possible reasons for these discrepancies.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Zeng and Stanley show that in yeast, intron-lariat intermediates that accumulated due to defects in pre-mRNA splicing, are transported to the cytoplasm using the canonical mRNA export pathway. Moreover, they demonstrate that export requires the nuclear basket, a sub-structure of the nuclear pore complex previously implicated with the retention of immature mRNAs. These observations are important as they put into question a longstanding model that the main role of the nuclear basket is to ensure nuclear retention of immature or faulty mRNAs.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors elegantly combine genetic, biochemical, and single-molecule resolution microscopy approaches to identify the cellular pathway that mediates the cytoplasmic accumulation of lariat intermediates. Cytoplasmic accumulation of such splicing intermediates had been observed in various previous studies but how these RNAs reach the cytoplasm had not yet been investigated. By using smFISH, the authors present compelling, and, for the first time, direct evidence that these intermediates accumulate in the cytoplasm and that this requires the canonical mRNA export pathway, including the RNA export receptor Mex67 as well as various RNA-binding proteins including Yra1, Npl3 and Nab2. Moreover, they show that the export of lariat intermediates, but not mRNAs, requires the nuclear basket (Mlp1) and basket-associated proteins previously linked to the mRNP rearrangements at the nuclear pore. This is a surprising and important observation with respect to a possible function of the nuclear basket in mRNA export and quality control, as it challenges a longstanding model that the role of the basket in mRNA export is primarily to act as a gatekeeper to ensure that immature mRNAs are not exported. As discussed by the authors, their finding suggests a role for the basket in promoting the export of certain types of RNAs rather than retention, a model also supported by more recent studies in mammalian cells. Moreover, their findings also collaborate with a recent paper showing that in yeast, not all nuclear pores contain a basket (PMID: 36220102), an observation that also questioned the gatekeeper model of the basket, as it is difficult to imagine how the basket can serve as a gatekeeper if not all nuclear pore contain such a structure.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>One weakness of this study is that all their experiments rely on using synthetic splicing reporter containing a lacZ gene that produces a relatively long transcript compared to the average yeast mRNA.</p>
<p>The rationale for using a reporter containing the brG (G branch point) resulting in more stable lariat intermediates due to them being inefficient substrates for the debranching enzyme Dbr1 could be described earlier in the manuscript, as this otherwise only becomes clear towards the end, what is confusing.</p>
<p>Discussion of their observation in the context that, in yeast, not all pores contain a basket would be useful.</p>

<p>We appreciate the reviewer’s comments and suggestions. Concerning the primer extension analysis, we are considering alternative assays to quantitate the pre-mRNA and lariat intermediate levels. Concerning the accessibility of the lariat intermediate in smRNA-FISH, in a dbr1∆ strain the only major species from the UAc reporter that is detected by primer extension is the lariat intermediate (Fig. S3), and this reporter is readily detected by smRNA-FISH, indicate that the lariat intermediate is accessible to smRNA-FISH. Concerning discriminating between pre-mRNA and lariat intermediate by smRNA-FISH, we agree with the reviewer that a dual smFISH experiment would directly distinguish between the signals of these species. The brG reporter we used in most smRNA-FISH experiments has a 5’ exon that is too short for smRNA-FISH probes, as is typical of most budding yeast 5’ exons. We have tried to replace the 5’ exon with a longer sequence (GFP) to allow for smRNA-FISH; however, this substitution inhibited splicing. Therefore, to distinguish signals from pre-mRNA versus lariat intermediate, we used additional reporters: G1c and brC reporters, which accumulate pre-mRNA essentially exclusively (Fig. S2A-C), and the UAc reporter, which accumulates lariat intermediate exclusively, in a dbr1∆ strain (Fig. S3). Whereas the mlp1 deletion did not change beta-galactosidase activities of the G1c and brC pre-mRNA-accumulating reporters (Fig. S2E), the mlp1 deletion in a dbr1∆ background did reduce the beta-galactosidase activities of the UAc lariat intermediate-accumulating reporter (Fig. 3D) and did increase smRNA-FISH signal of this reporter in the nucleus (Fig. 3E). These observations corroborate our interpretation based on the brG reporter that Mlp1p is required for efficient export of lariat intermediates but not pre-mRNAs.</p>

<p>It is true that we did not assess export of all reporters in all mutant strains by smFISH; however, we did validate the key conclusion that the export of lariat intermediates requires the nuclear basket gene MLP1: the export of both the brG reporter (mostly lariat intermediate) and the UAc reporter (exclusively lariat intermediate) showed a dependence on MLP1 (Fig. 3). Further, by beta-galactosidase activity, we tested in total five separate reporters – three that accumulated lariat intermediate and two that accumulated exclusively pre-mRNA; only the three reporters accumulating lariat intermediate showed a dependence of export on MLP1 (Fig. 4B,D; Fig S2D); the reporters accumulating pre-mRNA did not show a dependence on MLP1 (Fig. S2E), further validating our main conclusion. We are considering additional experiments to validate this key conclusion even further. Also, see response to comment 1 from reviewer 1.</p>
<p>We agree that the main conclusion from this manuscript differs from earlier studies. A key difference is that prior studies monitored exclusively pre-mRNA. In our study, we monitored pre-mRNA and lariat intermediate species and in doing so revealed a role for MLP1 in the export of lariat intermediates. This study, our previous study, as well as the previous studies of others have all provided evidence for efficient export of pre-mRNA; all of these studies are in conflict with the studies purporting a general role for the nuclear basked in retaining immature mRNA. Still, these past apparently conflicting studies can be re-interpreted in the context of our model that the export of such species requires docking at the nuclear basket, followed by undocking. In a revised manuscript, we will discuss the possibility that pre-mRNA apparently “retained” by the nuclear basket are stalled in export at the undocking stage.</p>
