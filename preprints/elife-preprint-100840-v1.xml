<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Understanding brain function relies on the collective work of many labs generating reproducible results. However, reproducibility has not been systematically assessed within the context of electrophysiological recordings during cognitive behaviors. To address this, we formed a multi-lab collaboration using a shared, open-source behavioral task and experimental apparatus. Experimenters in ten laboratories repeatedly targeted Neuropixels probes to the same location (spanning secondary visual areas, hippocampus, and thalamus) in mice making decisions; this generated a total of 121 experimental replicates, a unique dataset for evaluating reproducibility of electrophysiology experiments. Despite standardizing both behavioral and electrophysiological procedures, some experimental outcomes were highly variable. A closer analysis uncovered that variability in electrode targeting hindered reproducibility, as did the limited statistical power of some routinely used electrophysiological analyses, such as single-neuron tests of modulation by task parameters. Reproducibility was enhanced by histological and electrophysiological quality-control criteria. Our observations suggest that data from systems neuroscience is vulnerable to a lack of reproducibility, but that across-lab standardization, including metrics we propose, can serve to mitigate this.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Reproducibility is a cornerstone of the scientific method: a given sequence of experimental methods should lead to comparable results if applied in different laboratories. In some areas of biological and psychological science, however, the reliable generation of reproducible results is a well-known challenge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Crabbe et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Sittig et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Baker, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Voelkl et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Li et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Errington et al., 2021</xref>). In systems neuroscience at the level of single-cell-resolution recordings, evaluating reproducibility is difficult: experimental methods are sufficiently complex that replicating experiments is technically challenging, and many experimenters feel little incentive to do such experiments since negative results can be difficult to publish. Unfortunately, variability in experimental outcomes has been well-documented on a number of occasions. These include the existence and nature of “preplay” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Dragoi and Tonegawa, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Silva et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Ólafsdóttir et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Grosmark and Buzsáki, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Liu et al., 2019</xref>), the persistence of place fields in the absence of visual inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Hafting et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Barry et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Chen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Waaga et al., 2022</xref>), and the existence of spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP) in nematodes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Zhang et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Tsui et al., 2010</xref>). In the latter example, variability in experimental results arose from whether the nematode being studied was pigmented or albino, an experimental feature that was not originally known to be relevant to STDP. This highlights that understanding the source of experimental variability can facilitate efforts to improve reproducibility.</p>
<p>For electrophysiological recordings, several efforts are currently underway to document this variability and reduce it through standardization of methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">de Vries et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Siegle et al., 2021</xref>). These efforts are promising, in that they suggest that when approaches are standardized and results undergo quality control, observations conducted within a single organization can be reassuringly reproducible. However, this leaves unanswered whether observations made in separate, individual laboratories are reproducible when they likewise use standardization and quality control. Answering this question is critical since most neuroscience data is collected within small, individual laboratories rather than large-scale organizations. A high level of reproducibility of results across laboratories when procedures are carefully matched is a prerequisite to reproducibility in the more common scenario in which two investigators approach the same high-level question with slightly different experimental protocols. Therefore, establishing the extent to which observations are replicable even under carefully controlled conditions is critical to provide an upper bound on the expected level of reproducibility of findings in the literature more generally.</p>
<p>We have previously addressed the issue of reproducibility in the context of mouse psychophysical behavior, by training 140 mice in 7 laboratories and comparing their learning rates, speed, and accuracy in a simple binary visually-driven decision task. We demonstrated that standardized protocols can lead to highly reproducible behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">The International Brain Laboratory et al., 2021</xref>). Here, we build on those results by measuring within- and across-lab variability in the context of intra-cerebral electrophysiological recordings. We repeatedly inserted Neuropixels multi-electrode probes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Jun et al., 2017</xref>) targeting the same brain regions (including secondary visual areas, hippocampus, and thalamus) in mice performing an established decision-making task (<italic>The International Brain Laboratoryetal., 2021</italic>). We gathered data across ten different labs and developed a common histological and data processing pipeline to analyze the resulting large datasets. This pipeline included stringent new histological and electrophysiological quality-control criteria (the “Recording Inclusion Guidelines for Optimizing Reproducibility”, or RIGOR) that are applicable to datasets beyond our own.</p>
<p>We define reproducibility as a lack of systematic across-lab differences: that is, the distribution of within-lab observations is comparable to the distribution of across-lab observations, and thus a data analyst would be unable to determine in which lab a particular observation was measured. This definition takes into account the natural variability in electrophysiological results. After applying the RIGOR quality control measures, we found that features such as neuronal yield, firing rate, and LFP power were reproducible across laboratories according to this definition. However, the proportions of cells modulated and the precise degree of modulation by decision-making variables (such as the sensory stimulus or the choice), while reproducible for many tests and brain regions, failed to reproduce in some regions. To interpret these potential lab-to-lab differences in reproducibility, we developed a multi-task neural network encoding model that allows nonlinear interactions between variables. We found that within-lab random effects captured by this model were comparable to between-lab random effects. Taken together, these results suggest that electrophysiology experiments are vulnerable to a lack of reproducibility, but that standardization of procedures and quality control metrics can help to mitigate this problem.</p>

<title>Neuropixels recordings during decision-making target the same brain location</title>
<p>To quantify reproducibility across electrophysiological recordings, we set out to establish standardized procedures across the International Brain Laboratory (IBL) and to test whether this standardization led to reproducible results. Ten IBL labs collected Neuropixels recordings from one repeated site, targeting the same stereotaxic coordinates, during a standardized decision-making task in which head-fixed mice reported the perceived position of a visual grating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">The International Brain Laboratory et al., 2021</xref>). The experimental pipeline was standardized across labs, including surgical methods, behavioral training, recording procedures, histology, and data processing (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1a, b</xref>); see Methods for full details. Neuropixels probes were selected as the recording device for this study due to their standardized industrial production, and their 384 dual-band, low-noise recording channels providing the ability to sample many neurons in each of multiple brain regions simultaneously. In each experiment, Neuropixels 1.0 probes were inserted, targeted at −2.0 mm AP, −2.24 mm ML, 4.0 mm DV relative to bregma; 15° angle (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1c</xref>). This site was selected because it encompasses brain regions implicated in visual decision-making, including visual area A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Najafi et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Harvey et al., 2012</xref>), dentate gyrus, CA1, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Turk-Browne, 2019</xref>), and lateral posterior (LP) and posterior (PO) thalamic nuclei (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Saalmann and Kastner, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Roth et al., 2016</xref>).</p>

<p>Once data were acquired and brains were processed, we visualized probe trajectories using the Allen Institute Common Coordinate Frame (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1d</xref>, more methodological information is below). This allowed us to associate each neuron with a particular region (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1e</xref>). To evaluate whether our data were of comparable quality to previously published datasets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Steinmetz et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Siegle et al., 2021</xref>), we compared the neuron yield. The yield of an insertion, defined as the number of quality control (QC)-passing units recovered per electrode site, is informative about the quality of both the raw recording and the spike sorting pipeline. We performed a comparative yield analysis of the repeated site insertions and the external electrophysiology datasets. Both external datasets were recorded from mice performing a visual task, and include insertions from diverse brain regions.</p>
<p>Different spike sorting algorithms detect distinct units as well as varying numbers of units, and yield is sensitive to the inclusion criteria for putative neurons. We therefore re-analyzed the two comparison datasets using IBL’s spike sorting pipeline (<italic>The International Brain Laboratory et al., 2022a</italic>). When filtered using identical quality control metrics and split by brain region, we found the yield was comparable across datasets within each region (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1f</xref>). A two-way ANOVA on the yield per insertion with dataset (IBL, Steinmetz, or Allen/Siegle) and region (Cortex, Thalamus, or Hippocampus) as categorical variables showed no significant effect of dataset origin (p=0.31), but a significant effect of brain region (<italic>p &lt;</italic> 10−17). Systematic differences between our dataset and others were likewise absent for a number of other metrics (<xref rid="fig1s4" ref-type="fig">Figure 1, supp. 4</xref>).</p>
<p>Finally, in addition to the quantitative assessment of data quality, a qualitative assessment was performed. 100 total insertions were randomly selected from the three datasets and assigned random IDs to blind the raters during manual assessment. Three raters were asked to look at snippets of raw data traces with spikes overlaid and rate the overall quality of the recording and spike detection on a scale from 1-10, taking into account the apparent noise levels, drift, artifacts, and missed spikes. We found no evidence for systematic quality differences across the datasets (<xref rid="fig1s5" ref-type="fig">Figure 1, supp. 5</xref>).</p>

<title>Stereotaxic probe placement limits resolution of probe targeting</title>
<p>As a first test of experimental reproducibility, we assessed variability in Neuropixels probe placement around the planned repeated site location. Brains were perfusion-fixed, dissected, and imaged using serial section 2-photon microscopy for 3D reconstruction of probe trajectories (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2a</xref>). Whole brain auto-fluorescence data was aligned to the Allen Common Coordinate Framework (CCF) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Wang et al., 2020</xref>) using an elastix-based pipeline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Klein et al., 2010</xref>) adapted for mouse brain registration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">West, 2021</xref>). cm-DiI labelled probe tracks were manually traced in the 3D volume (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2b</xref>; <xref rid="fig2s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2, supp. 1</xref>). Trajectories obtained from our stereotaxic system and traced histology were then compared to the planned trajectory. To measure probe track variability, each traced probe track was linearly interpolated to produce a straight line insertion in CCF space (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2c</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>We first compared the micro-manipulator brain surface coordinate to the planned trajectory to assess variance due to targeting strategies only (targeting variability, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2d</xref>). Targeting variability occurs when experimenters must move probes slightly from the planned location to avoid blood vessels or irregularities. These slight movements of the probes led to sizeable deviations from the planned insertion site (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2d</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">g</xref>, total mean displacement = 104 µm).</p>
<p>Geometrical variability, obtained by calculating the difference between planned and final identified probe position acquired from the reconstructed histology, encompasses targeting variance, anatomical differences, and errors in defining the stereotaxic coordinate system. Geometrical variability was more extensive (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2e</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">h</xref>, total mean displacement = 356.0 µm). Assessing geometrical variability for all probes with permutation testing revealed a p-value of 0.19 across laboratories (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2h</xref>), arguing that systematic lab-to-lab differences don’t account for the observed variability.</p>
<p>To determine the extent that anatomical differences drive this geometrical variability, we regressed histology-to-planned probe insertion distance at the brain surface against estimates of animal brain size. Regression against both animal body weight and estimated brain volume from histological reconstructions showed no correlation to probe displacement (R2 &lt; 0.03), suggesting differences between CCF and mouse brain sizes are not the major cause of variance. An alternative explanation is that geometrical variance in probe placement at the brain surface is driven by inaccuracies in defining the stereotaxic coordinate system, including discrepancies between skull landmarks and the underlying brain structures.</p>
<p>Accurate placement of probes in deeper brain regions is critically dependent on probe angle. We assessed probe angle variability by comparing the final histologically-reconstructed probe angle to the planned trajectory. We observed a consistent mean displacement from the planned angle in both medio-lateral (ML) and anterior-posterior (AP) angles (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2f</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">i</xref>, total mean difference in angle from planned: 7.5 degrees). Angle differences can be explained by the different orientations and geometries of the CCF and the stereotaxic coordinate systems, which we have recently resolved in a corrected atlas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Birman et al., 2023</xref>). The difference in histology angle to planned probe placement was assessed with permutation testing across labs, and shows a p-value of 0.45 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2i</xref>). This suggests that systematic lab-to-lab differences were minimal.</p>
<p>In conclusion, insertion variance, in particular geometrical variability, is sizeable enough to impact probe targeting to desired brain regions and poses a limit on the resolution of probe targeting. The histological reconstruction, fortunately, does provide an accurate reflection of the true probe trajectory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Liu et al., 2021</xref>), which is essential for interpretation of the Neuropixels recording data. We were unable to identify a prescriptive analysis to account for probe placement variance, which may reflect that the major driver of probe placement variance derives from differences in skull landmarks used for establishing the coordinate system and the underlying brain structures. Our data suggest the resolution of probe insertion targeting on the brain surface to be approximately 360 µm (based on the mean across labs, see <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2h</xref>), which Reproducibility of electrophysiological features</p>
<p>Having established that targeting of Neuropixels probes to the desired target location was a source of substantial variability, we next measured the variability and reproducibility of electrophysiological features recorded by the probes. We implemented twelve exclusion criteria. Two of these were specific to our experiments: a behavior criterion where the mouse completed at least 400 trials of the behavioral task, and a session number criterion of at least 3 sessions per lab for analyses that directly compared across labs (permutation tests; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3d</xref>, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4e</xref>, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>). The remaining ten criteria, which we collectively refer to as the “Recording Inclusion Guidelines for Optimizing Reproducibility” (RIGOR; <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), are more general and can be applied widely to electrophysiology experiments: a yield criterion, a noise criterion, LFP power criterion, qualitative criteria for visual assessment (lack of drift, epileptiform activity, noisy channels and artifacts, see <xref rid="fig1s3" ref-type="fig">Figure 1-supplement 3</xref> for examples), and single unit metrics (refractory period violation, amplitude cutoff, and median spike amplitude). These metrics could serve as a benchmark for other studies to use when reporting results, acknowledging that a subset of the metrics will be adjusted for measurements made in different animals, regions or behavioral contexts.</p>

</table-wrap>
<p>We recorded a total of 121 sessions targeted at our planned repeated site (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3a</xref>). Of these, 18 sessions were excluded due to incomplete data acquisition caused by a hardware failure during the experiment (10) or because we were unable to complete histology on the subject (8). Next, we applied exclusion criteria to the remaining complete datasets. We first applied the RIGOR standards described in <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. Upon manual inspection, we observed 1 recording fail due to drift, 10 recordings fail due to a high and unrecoverable count of noisy channels, 2 recordings fail due to artefacts, and 1 recording fail due to epileptiform activity. 1 recording failed our criterion for low yield, and 1 recording failed our criterion for noise level (both automated quality control criteria). Next, we applied criteria specific to our behavioral experiments, and found that 5 recordings failed our behavior criterion by not meeting the minimum of 400 trials completed). Some of our analysis also required further (stricter) inclusion criteria (see Methods).</p>
<p>When plotting all recordings, including those that failed to meet quality control criteria, one can observe that many discarded sessions were clear outliers (<xref rid="fig3s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 3-supplemental 1</xref>). In subsequent figures, only recordings that passed these quality control criteria were included. Overall, we analyzed data from the 82 remaining sessions recorded in ten labs to determine the reproducibility of our electrophysiological recordings. The responses of 5312 single neurons (all passing the metrics defined in (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) are analyzed below; this total reflects an average of 105 ± 53 [mean ± std] per insertion.</p>
<p>We then evaluated whether electrophysiological features of these neurons, such as firing rates and LFP power, were re-producible across laboratories. In other words, is there consistent variation across laboratories in these features that is larger than expected by chance? We first visualized LFP power, a feature used by experimenters to guide the alignment of the probe position to brain regions, for all the repeated site recordings (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3b</xref>). The dentate gyrus (DG) is characterized by high power spectral density of the LFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Penttonen et al., 1997</xref>; <italic>Braginet al., 1995</italic>; <italic>Senzaiand Buzsáki, 2017</italic>) and this feature was used to guide physiology-to-histology alignment of probe positions (<xref rid="fig3s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 3-supplementary 2</xref>). By plotting the LFP power of all recordings along the length of the probe side-by-side, aligned to the boundary between the DG and thalamus, we confirmed that this band of elevated LFP power was visible in all recordings at the same depth. The variability in the extent of the band of elevated LFP power in DG was due to the fact that the DG has variable thickness and due to targeting variability, not every insertion passed through the DG at the same point in the sagittal plane (<xref rid="fig3s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 3-supplemental 2</xref>).</p>
<p>The probe alignment allowed us to attribute the channels of each probe to their corresponding brain regions to investigate the reproducibility of electrophysiological features for each of the target regions of the repeated site. To visualize all the neuronal data, each neuron was plotted at the depth it was recorded overlaid with the position of the target brain region locations (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3c</xref>). From these visualizations it is apparent that there is recording-to-recording variability. Several trajectories, most notably from UCLA and UW, missed their targets in deeper brain regions (LP, PO), as indicated by gray blocks. These trajectories are the ones that show a large displacement from the target insertion coordinates; note that insertions from UCLA and UW are consistently placed in one quadrant relative to the target (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2f</xref>). These observations raise two questions: (1) Is the recording-to-recording variability within an animal the same or different compared to across animals? (2) Is the recording-to-recording variability lab dependent?</p>
<p>These criteria could be applied to other electrophysiology experiments to enhance reproducibility. Note that whole recording metrics are most relevant to large scale (&gt;20 channel) recordings. For those recordings, manual inspection of datasets passing these criteria will further enhance data quality.</p>
<p>To answer the first question we performed several bilateral recordings in which the same insertion was targeted in both hemispheres, as mirror images of one another. This allowed us to quantify the variability between insertions within the same animal and compare this variability to the across-animal variability (<xref rid="fig3s3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3-supplemental 3</xref>). We found that whether within- or across-animal variance was larger depended on the electrophysiological feature in question (<xref rid="fig3s3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3-supplemental 3f</xref>). For example, neuronal yield was highly variable across animals, and less so within animals. By contrast, noise (assessed as action-potential band root mean square, or AP band RMS) was more variable within the same animal than across animals, presumably because probes have noise levels which are relatively stable over time.</p>
<p>To test whether recording-to-recording variability is lab dependent, we used a permutation testing approach (Methods). The tested features were neuronal yield, firing rate, spike amplitude, LFP power, and AP band RMS. These were calculated in each brain region (<xref rid="fig3s4" ref-type="fig">Figure 3-supplemental 4</xref>). As was the case when analysing probe placement variability, the permutation test assesses whether the distribution over features varies significantly across labs. When correcting for multiple tests, we were concerned that systematic corrections (such as a Bonferroni correction) might be too lenient and could lead us to overlook failures (or at least threats) to reproducibility. We therefore opted to use a more stringent <italic>a</italic> of 0.01 when establishing significance. The permutation test revealed a significant effect for the spike amplitude in VISa/am. Otherwise, we found that all electrophysiological features were reproducible across laboratories for all regions studied (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3d</xref>).</p>
<p>The permutation testing approach evaluated the reproducibility of each electrophysiological feature separately. It could be the case, however, that some combination of these features varied systematically across laboratories. To test whether this was the case, we trained a Random Forest classifier to predict in which lab a recording was made, based on the electrophysiological markers. The decoding was performed separately for each brain region because of their distinct physiological signatures. A null distribution was generated by shuffling the lab labels and decoding again using the shuffled labels (500 iterations). The significance of the classifier was defined as the fraction of times the accuracy of the decoding of the shuffled labels was higher than the original labels. For validation, we first verified that the decoder could successfully identify brain region (instead of lab identity) from the electrophysiological features; the decoder was able to identify brain region with high accuracy (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3e</xref>, left). When decoding lab identity, the classifier had above-chance performance only on the dentate gyrus and not from any of the other regions, indicating that most electrophysiological features were reproducible across laboratories for these regions (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3e</xref>, right).</p>

<sec id="s2c">
<title>Reproducibility of functional activity depends on brain region and analysis method</title>
<p>Concerns about reproducibility extend not only to electrophysiological properties, but also functional properties. To address this, we analyzed the reproducibility of neural activity driven by perceptual decisions about the spatial location of a visual grating stimulus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">The International Brain Laboratory et al., 2021</xref>). In total, we compared the activity of 4400 neurons across all labs and regions. We focused on whether the targeted brain regions have comparable neural responses to stimuli, movements and rewards. An inspection of individual neurons revealed clear modulation by, for instance, the onset of movement to report a particular choice (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4a</xref>). Despite considerable neuron-to-neuron variability (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4b</xref>), the temporal dynamics of session-averaged neural activity were similar across labs in some regions (see VISa/am, CA1 and DG in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4d</xref>). Elsewhere, the session-averaged neural response was more variable (see LP and PO in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4c</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">d</xref>).</p>
<p>Having observed that many individual neurons are modulated by task variables during decision-making, we examined the reproducibility of the proportion of modulated neurons. Within each brain region, we compared the proportion of neurons that were modulated by stimuli, movements or rewards (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4e</xref>). We used six comparisons of task-related time windows (using Wilcoxon signed-rank tests and Wilcoxon rank-sum tests, <italic>Steinmetz et al.</italic> (<italic>2019</italic>)) to identify neurons with significantly modulated firing rates (for this, we use <italic>a</italic> = 0.05) during the task (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4e</xref>, top and <xref rid="fig4s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 4-supplemental 1</xref> specify which time windows we compared for which test on each trial, since leftwards versus rightwards choices are not paired we use Wilcoxon rank-sum tests to determine modulation for them). For most tests, the proportions of modulated neurons across sessions and across brain regions were quite variable (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4e</xref>, bottom and <xref rid="fig4s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 4-supplemental 1</xref>).</p>
<p>After determining that our measurements afforded sufficient power to detect differences across labs (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4f,g</xref>, <xref rid="fig4s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 4-supplemental 2</xref>, see Methods), we evaluated reproducibility of these proportions using permutation tests (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4h</xref>). Our tests uncovered only one region and period for which there were significant differences across labs (<italic>a</italic> = 0.01, no multiple comparisons correction, as described above): VISa/am during the stimulus onset period (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4h</xref>, top). In addition to examining the proportion of responsive neurons (a quantity often used to determine that a particular area subserves a particular function), we also compared the full distribution of firing rate modulations. Here, reproducibility was tenuous and failed in thalamic regions for some tests (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4h</xref>, bottom). Taken together, these tests uncover that some traditional metrics of neuron modulation are vulnerable to a lack of reproducibility.</p>
<p>These failures in reproducibility were driven by outlier labs; for instance, for movement-driven activity in PO, UCLA reported an average change of 0 spikes/s, while CCU reported a large and consistent change (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4d</xref>, right most panel, compare orange vs. yellow traces). Similarly, the differences in modulation in VISa/am were driven by one lab, in which all four mice had a higher percentage of modulated neurons than mice in other labs (<xref rid="fig4s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 4-supplemental 1a</xref>, purple dots at right).</p>
<p>Looking closely at the individual sessions and neuronal responses, we were unable to find a simple explanation for these outliers: they were not driven by differences in mouse behavior, wheel kinematics when reporting choices, or spatial position of neurons (examined in detail in the next section). This high variability across individual neurons meant that differences that are clear in across-lab aggregate data can be unclear within a single lab. For instance, a difference between the proportion of neurons modulated by movement initiation vs. left/right choices is clear in the aggregate data (compare panels d and f in <xref rid="fig4s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 4-supplemental 1</xref>), but much less clear in the data from any single lab (e.g., compare values for individual labs in panels d vs. f of <xref rid="fig4s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 4-supplemental 1</xref>). This is an example of a finding that might fail to reproduce across individual labs, and underscores that single-neuron analyses are susceptible to lack of reproducibility, in part due to the high variability of single neuron responses. Very large sample sizes of neurons could serve to mitigate this problem.</p>
<p>Having discovered vulnerabilities in the reproducibility of standard single-neuron tests, we tested reproducibility using an alternative approach: comparing low-dimensional summaries of activity across labs and regions. To start, we summarized the response for each neuron by computing peri-event time histograms (PETHs, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5a</xref>). Because temporal dynamics may depend on reaction time, we generated separate PETHs for fast (<italic>&lt;</italic> 0.15 s) and slow (<italic>&gt;</italic> 0.15 s) reaction times (0.15 s was the mean reaction time when considering the distribution of reaction times across all sessions). We concatenated the resulting vectors to obtain a more thorough summary of each cell’s average activity during decision-making. The results (below) did not depend strongly on the details of the trial-splitting; for example, splitting trials by “left” vs “right” behavioral choice led to similar results.</p>
<p>Next, we projected these high-dimensional summary vectors into a low-dimensional “embedding” space using principal component analysis (PCA). This embedding captures the variability of the population while still allowing for easy visualization and further analysis. Specifically, we stack each cell’s summary double-PETH vector (described above) into a matrix (containing the summary vectors for all cells across all sessions) and run PCA to obtain a low-rank approximation of this matrix (see Methods). The accuracy of reconstructions from the top two principal components (PCs) varied across cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5a</xref>); PETHs for the majority of cells could be well-reconstructed with just 2 PCs (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5b</xref>).</p>
<p>This simple embedding exposes differences in brain regions (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5c</xref>; e.g., PO and DG are segregated in the embedding space), verifying that the approach is sufficiently powerful to detect expected regional differences in response dynamics. Region-to-region differences are also visible in the region-averaged PETHs and cumulative distributions of the first PCs (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5d, e</xref>). By contrast, differences are less obvious when coloring the same embedded activity by labs (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5f, g, h</xref>), however some labs, such as CCU and CSHL(Z) are somewhat segregated. In comparison to regions, the activity point clouds overlap somewhat more homogeneously across most labs (<xref rid="fig5s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 5-supplemental 1</xref> for scatter plots, PETHs, cumulative distributions for each region separately, colored by lab).</p>
<p>We quantified this observation via two tests. First, we applied a permutation test using the first 2 PCs of all cells, computing each region’s 2D distance between its mean embedded activity and the mean across all remaining regions, then comparing these values to the null distribution of values obtained in an identical manner after shuffling the region labels. Second, we directly compared the distributions of the first PCs, applying the Kolmorogov-Smirnov (KS) test to determine whether the distribution of a subset of cells was different from that of all remaining cells, targeting either labs or regions. The KS test results were nearly identical to the 2D distance permutation test results, hence we report only the KS test results below.</p>
<p>This analysis confirmed that the neural activity in each region differs significantly (as defined above, <italic>a</italic> = 0.01, no multiple comparison correction) from the neural activity measured in the other regions (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5i</xref>, bottom row), demonstrating that neural dynamics differ from region-to-region, as expected and as suggested by <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5c-e</xref>. We also found that the neural activity from 7/10 labs differed significantly from the neural activity of all remaining labs when considering all neurons (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5i</xref>, right column). When restricting this test to single regions, significant differences were observed for 6/40 lab-region pairs (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5i</xref>, purple squares in the left columns). Note that in panels i of <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>, the row “all” indicates that all cells were used when testing if a region had a different distribution of first PCs than the remaining regions and analogously the column “all” for lab-targeted tests. Overall, these observations are in keeping with <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref> and suggest, as above, that outlier responses during decision-making can be present despite careful standardization (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5i</xref>).</p>

<title>The spatial position and spike waveforms of neurons explain minimal variability</title>
<p>In addition to lab-to-lab variability, which was low for electrophysiological features and higher for functional modulation during decision-making (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4</xref>, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>), we observed considerable variability between recording sessions and mice. Here, we examined whether this variability could be explained by either the within-region location of the Neuropixels probe or the single-unit spike waveform characteristics of the sampled neurons.</p>
<p>To investigate variability in session-averaged firing rates, we identified neurons that had firing rates different from the majority of neurons within each region (absolute deviation from the median firing rate being &gt;15% of the firing rate range). These outlier neurons, which all turned out to be high-firing, were compared against the general population of neurons in terms of five features: spatial position (x, y, z, computed as the center-of-mass of each unit’s spike template on the probe, localized to CCF coordinates in the histology pipeline) and spike waveform characteristics (amplitude, peak-to-trough duration). We observed that recordings in all areas, such as LP (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6a</xref>), indeed spanned a wide space within those areas. Interestingly, in areas other than DG, the highest firing neurons were not entirely uniformly distributed in space. For instance, in LP, high firing neurons tended to be positioned more laterally and centered on the anterior-posterior axis (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6b</xref>). In VISa/am and CA1, only the spatial position of neurons, but not differences in spike characteristics, contributed to differences in session-averaged firing rates (<xref rid="fig6s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 6-supplemental 1b</xref> and <xref rid="fig6s2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>). In contrast, high-firing neurons in LP, PO, and DG had different spike characteristics compared to other neurons in their respective regions (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figures 6b</xref> and <xref rid="fig6s3" ref-type="fig">6-supplemental 3a,c</xref>). It does not appear that high-firing neurons in any brain region belong clearly to a specific neuronal subtype (see <xref rid="fig6s5" ref-type="fig">Figure 6-supplemental 5</xref>).</p>

<p>To quantify variability in session-averaged firing rates of individual neurons that can be explained by spatial position or spike characteristics, we fit a linear regression model with these five features (x, y, z, spike amplitude, and duration of each neuron) as the inputs. For each brain region, features that had significant weights were mostly consistent with the results reported above: In VISa/am and CA1, spatial position explained part of the variance; in DG, the variance could not be explained by either spatial position or spike characteristics; in LP and PO, both spatial position and spike amplitudes explained some of the variance. In LP and PO, where the most amount of variability could be explained by this regression model (having higher <italic>R</italic>2 values), these five features still only accounted for a total of,. 5% of the firing rate variability. In VISa/am, CA1, and DG, they accounted for approximately 2%, 4%, and 2% of the variability, respectively.</p>
<p>Next, we examined whether neuronal spatial position and spike features contributed to variability in task-modulated activity. We found that brain regions other than DG had minor, yet significant, differences in spatial positions of task-modulated and non-modulated neurons (using the definition of at least of one of the six time-period comparisons in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4e</xref> and <xref rid="fig4s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 4-supplemental 1</xref>). For instance, LP neurons modulated according to the movement initiation test and the left versus right movement test tended to be more ventral (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6c-d</xref>). Other brain regions had weaker spatial differences than LP (<xref rid="fig6s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 6-supplemental 1</xref>, <xref rid="fig6s2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, <xref rid="fig6s3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Spike characteristics were significantly different between task-modulated and non-modulated neurons only for one modulation test in LP (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6d</xref>) and two tests in DG, but not in other brain regions. On the other hand, the task-aligned Fano Factors of neurons did not have any differences in spatial position except for in VISa/am, where lower Fano Factors (&lt;1) tended to be located ventrally (<xref rid="fig6s4" ref-type="fig">Figure 6-supplemental 4</xref>). Spike characteristics of neurons with lower vs. higher Fano Factors were only slightly different in VISa/am, CA1, and PO. Lastly, we trained a linear regression model to predict the 2D embedding of PETHs of each cell shown in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5c</xref> from the x, y, z coordinates and found that spatial position contains little information (<italic>R</italic>2., 5%) about the embedded PETHs of cells.</p>
<p>In summary, our results suggest that neither spatial position within a region nor waveform characteristics account for very much variability in neural activity. We examine other sources of variability in the next section.</p>

<title>A multi-task neural network accurately predicts activity and quantifies sources of neural variability</title>
<p>As discussed above, variability in neural activity between labs or between sessions can be due to many factors. These include differences in behavior between animals, differences in probe placement between sessions, and uncontrolled differences in experimental setups between labs. Simple linear regression models or generalized linear models (GLMs) are likely too inflexible to capture the nonlinear contributions that many of these variables, including lab identity and spatial positions of neurons, might make to neural activity. On the other hand, fitting a different nonlinear regression model (involving many covariates) individually to each recorded neuron would be computationally expensive and could lead to poor predictive performance due to overfitting.</p>
<p>To estimate a flexible nonlinear model given constraints on available data and computation time, we adapt an approach that has proven useful in the context of sensory neuroscience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">McIntosh et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Batty et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Cadena et al., 2019</xref>). We use a “multi-task” neural network (MTNN; <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7a</xref>) that takes as input a set of covariates (including the lab ID, the neuron’s 3D spatial position in standardized CCF coordinates, the animal’s estimated pose extracted from behavioral video monitoring, feedback times, and others; see <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> for a full list). The model learns a set of nonlinear features (shared over all recorded neurons) and fits a Poisson regression model on this shared feature space for each neuron. With this approach we effectively solve multiple nonlinear regression tasks simultaneously; hence the “multi-task” nomenclature. The model extends simpler regression approaches by allowing nonlinear interactions between covariates. In particular, previous reduced-rank regression approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Kobak et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Izenman, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Steinmetz et al., 2019</xref>) can be seen as a special case of the multi-task neural network, with a single hidden layer and linear weights in each layer.</p>

The leave-one-out analysis shows that lab/session IDs have low effect sizes on average, indicating that within and between-lab random effects are small and comparable. The “noise” covariate is a dynamic covariate (white noise randomly sampled from a Gaussian distribution) and is included as a negative control: the model correctly assigns zero effect size to this covariate. Covariates that are constant across trials (e.g., lab and session IDs, neuron’s 3D spatial location) are left out from the single-covariate analysis.</p></caption>

<p><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7b</xref> shows model predictions on held-out trials for a single neuron in VISa/am. We plot the observed and predicted peri-event time histograms and raster plots for left trials. As a visual overview of which behavioral covariates are correlated with the MTNN prediction of this neuron’s activity on each trial, the predicted raster plot and various behavioral covariates that are input into the MTNN are shown in <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7c</xref>. Overall, the MTNN approach accurately predicts the observed firing rates. When the MTNN and GLMs are trained on movement, task-related, and prior covariates, the MTNN slightly outperforms the GLMs on predicting the firing rate of held-out test trials (See <xref rid="fig7s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 7-supplemental 1b</xref>).</p>
<p>Next we use the predictive model performance to quantify the contribution of each covariate to the fraction of variance explained by the model. Following <italic>Musall et al.</italic> (<italic>2019</italic>), we run two complementary analyses to quantify these effect sizes: <italic>single-covariate fits</italic>, in which we fit the model using just one of the covariates, and <italic>leave-one-out fits</italic>, in which we train the model with one of the covariates left out and compare the predictive explained to that of the full model. As an extension of the leave-one-out analysis, we run the <italic>leave-group-out analysis</italic>, in which we quantify the contribution of each group of covariates (electrophysiological, task-related, and movement) to the model performance. Using data simulated from GLMs, we first validate that the MTNN leave-one-out analysis is able to partition and explain different sources of neural variability (See <xref rid="fig7s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 7-supplemental 2</xref>).</p>
<p>We then run single-covariate, leave-one-out, and leave-group-out analyses to quantify the contributions of the covariates listed in <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> to the predictive performance of the model on held-out test trials. The results are summarized in <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7d</xref> and <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7e</xref>, with a simulated positive control analysis in <xref rid="fig7s3" ref-type="fig">Figure 7-supplemental 3</xref>. According to the single-covariate analysis (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7d</xref>), face motion energy (derived from behavioral video), paw speed, wheel velocity, and first movement onset timing can individually explain about 5% of variance of the neurons on average, and these single-covariate effect sizes are highly correlated (<xref rid="fig7s4" ref-type="fig">Figure 7-supplemental 4</xref>). The leave-one-out analysis (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7e</xref> left) shows that most covariates have low unique contribution to the predictive power. This is because many covariates are correlated and are capable of capturing variance in the neural activity even if one of the covariates is dropped (See behavioral raster plots in <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7c</xref>). According to the leave-group-out analysis (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7e</xref> right), the “movement” covariates as a group have the highest unique contribution to the model’s performance while the task-related and electrophysiological variables have close-to-zero unique contribution. Most importantly, the leave-one-out analysis shows that lab and session IDs, conditioning on the covariates listed in <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, have close to zero effect sizes, indicating that within-lab and between-lab random effects are small and comparable.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We set out to test whether the results from an electrophysiology experiment could be reproduced across 10 geographically separated laboratories. We observed notable variability in the position of the electrodes in the brain despite efforts to target the same location (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). Fortunately, after applying stringent quality-control criteria (including the RIGOR standards, <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), we found that electrophysiological features such as neuronal yield, firing rate, and LFP power were reproducible across laboratories (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3d</xref>). The proportion of neurons with responses that were modulated, and the ways in which they were modulated by behaviorally-relevant task events was more variable: lab-to-lab differences were evident in the thalamic region PO and in the cortical region VISa/am (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4</xref>, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>) and these were not explainable by, for instance, systematic variation in the subregions that were targeted (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>). When we trained a multi-task neural network to predict neural activity, lab identity accounted for little neural variance (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>), arguing that the lab-to-lab differences we observed are driven by outlier neurons/sessions and nonlinear interactions between variables, rather than, for instance, systematic biases. This is reassuring, but points to the need for large sample sizes of neurons to overcome the inherent variability of single neuron recording. Altogether, our results suggest that standardization and quality control standards can enhance reproducibility, and that caution should be taken with regard to electrode placement and the interpretation of some standard single-neuron metrics.</p>
<p>The absence of systematic differences across labs for some metrics argues that standardization of procedures is a helpful step in generating reproducible results. Our experimental design precludes an analysis of whether the reproducibility we observed was driven by person-to-person standardization or lab-to-lab standardization. Most likely, both factors contributed: all lab personnel received standardized instructions for how to implant head bars and train animals, which likely reduced personnel-driven differences. In addition, our use of standardized instrumentation and software minimized lab-to-lab differences that might normally be present.</p>
<p>Reproducibility in our electrophysiology studies was further enhanced by rigorous quality control metrics that ultimately led us to exclude a significant fraction of datasets (retaining 82 / 121 experimental sessions). Quality control was enforced for diverse aspects of the experiments, including histology, behavior, targeting, neuronal yield, and the total number of completed sessions. A number of recordings with high noise and/or low neuronal yield were excluded. Exclusions were driven by artifacts present in the recordings, inadequate grounding, and a decline in craniotomy health; all of these can potentially be improved with experimenter experience. A few quality control metrics were specific to our experiments (and thus not listed in <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). For instance, we excluded sessions with fewer than 400 trials, which could be too stringent (or not stringent enough) for other experiments.</p>
<p>These observations suggest that future experiments would be more consistently reproducible if researchers followed, or at least reported, a number of agreed upon criteria, such as the RIGOR standards we define in <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. This approach has been successful in other fields: for instance, the neuroimaging field has agreed upon a set of guidelines for “best practices,” and has identified factors that can impede those practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Nichols et al., 2017</xref>). The genomics field likewise adopted the Minimum Information about a Microarray Experiment (MIAME) standard, designed to ensure that data from microarrays could be meaningfully interpreted and experimentally verified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Brazma et al., 2001</xref>). The autophagy community has a similar set of guidelines for experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Klionsky, 2016</xref>). Our work here suggests the creation of a similar set of standards for electrophysiology and behavioral experiments would be beneficial, at least on an “opt in” basis: for instance, manuscript authors, especially those new to electrophysiology, could state which of the metrics were adhered to, and which were not needed. The metrics might also serve as the starting point for training students how to impose inclusion criteria for electrophysiological studies. Importantly, the use of RIGOR need not prevent flexibility: studies focusing on multi-unit activity would naturally omit single unit metrics, and studies on other animals or contexts would understandably need to adjust some metrics.</p>
<p>Establishment of such standards has the potential to enhance lab-to-lab reproducibility, but experiment-to-experiment variability may not be entirely eliminated. A large-scale effort to enhance reproducibility in <italic>C. elegans</italic> aging studies successfully replicated average lifespan curves across 3 labs by standardizing experimental methods such as handling of organisms and notation of age (e.g. when egg is hatched vs laid) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Lithgow et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Lucanic et al., 2017</xref>). Still, variability in the lifespan curves of individual worms nevertheless persisted, warranting further studies to understand what molecular differences might explain this. Similarly, we observed no systematic difference across labs in some electrophysiological measures such as LFP power (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3d</xref>) or functional responses in some regions but found considerable variability across experiments in other regions (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4h</xref>, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5i</xref>).</p>
<p>We found probe targeting to be a large source of variability. One possibility is that some aspect of our approach was vulnerable to targeting errors. Another possibility is that our approach uncovered a weakness in the standard targeting methods. Our ability to detect targeting error benefited from an automated histological pipeline combined with alignment and tracing that required agreement between multiple users. This approach, which exceeds what is done in many experimental labs, revealed that much of the variance in targeting was due to the probe entry positions at the brain surface, which were randomly displaced across the dataset. The source of this variance could be due to a discrepancy in skull landmarks compared to the underlying brain anatomy. Accuracy in placing probes along a planned trajectory is therefore limited by this variability (about 400µm). Probe angle also showed a small degree of variance and a bias in both anterior-posterior and medio-lateral direction, indicating that the Allen Common Coordinate Framework (CCF) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Wang et al., 2020</xref>) and stereotaxic coordinate systems are slightly offset. Minimizing variance in probe targeting is an important element in increasing reproducibility, as slight deviations in probe entry position and angle can lead to samples from different populations of neurons. We envision three solutions to this problem: first, probe angles must be carefully computed from the CCF, as the CCF and stereotaxic coordinate systems do not define the same coronal plane angle. Second, collecting structural MRI data in advance of implantation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Browning et al., 2023</xref>) could reduce targeting error, although this is infeasible for most labs. A third solution is to rely on stereotaxic coordinates and account for the inevitable off-target measurements by increasing cohort sizes. Experimenters are often reluctant to exclude subjects, but our analysis demonstrates that targeting error can lead to missed targets with non-negligible frequency. Indeed, small differences in probe location may be responsible for other studies arriving at different conclusions, highlighting the need for agreed upon methods for targeting specific areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Rajasethupathy et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Andrianova et al., 2022</xref>).</p>
<p>Our results also highlight the critical importance of reproducible histological processing and subsequent probe alignment. Specifically, we used a centralized histology and registration pipeline to assign each recording site on each probe to a particular anatomical location, based on registration of the histological probe trajectories to the CCF and the electrophysiological features recorded at each site. This differs from previous approaches, in which stereotaxic coordinates alone were used to target an area of interest and exclusion criteria were not specified; see e.g. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Harvey et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Raposo et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Erlich et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Goard et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Najafi et al., 2020</xref>). The reliance on stereotaxic coordinates for localization, instead of standardized histological registration, is a possible explanation for conflicting results across laboratories in previous literature. Our results speak to the importance of adopting standardized procedures more broadly across laboratories.</p>
<p>A major contribution of our work is open-source data and code: we share our full dataset (see Data Availability) and suite of analysis tools for quantifying reproducibility (see Code Availability) and computing the RIGOR standards. The analyses here required significant improvements in data architecture, visualization, spike sorting, histology image analysis, and video analysis. Our analyses uncovered major gaps and issues in the existing toolsets that required improvements (see Methods and <italic>The International Brain Laboratory et al.</italic> (<italic>2022b</italic>,a) for full details). For example, we improved existing spike sorting pipelines with regard to scalability, reproducibility, and stability. These improvements contribute towards advancing automated spike sorting, and move beyond subjective manual curation, which scales poorly and limits reproducibility. We anticipate that our open-source dataset will play an important role in further improvements to these pipelines and also the development of further methods for modeling the spike trains of many simultaneously recorded neurons across multiple brain areas and experimental sessions.</p>
<p>Scientific advances rely on the reproducibility of experimental findings. The current study demonstrates that reproducibility is attainable for many features measured during a standardized perceptual decision task. We offer several recommendations to enhance reproducibility, including (1) standardized protocols for data collection and processing, (2) methods to account for variability in electrode targeting and (3) rigorous data quality metrics, such as RIGOR. These recommendations are urgently needed as neuroscience continues to move towards increasingly large and complex datasets.</p>

<title>Animals</title>
<p>Mice were housed under a 12/12 h light/dark cycle (normal or inverted depending on the laboratory) with food and water available ad libitum, except during behavioural training days. Electrophysiological recordings and behavioural training were performed during either the dark or light phase of the cycle depending on the laboratory. N=78 adult mice (C57BL/6, male and female, obtained from either Jackson Laboratory or Charles River) were used in this study. Mice were aged 111 - 442 days and weighed 16.4-34.5 g on the day of their first electrophysiology recording session in the repeated site.</p>

<title>Materials and apparatus</title>
<p>Briefly, each lab installed a standardized electrophysiological rig (named ‘ephys rig’ throughout this text), which differed slightly from the apparatus used during behavioral training (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">The International Brain Laboratory et al., 2021</xref>). The general structure of the rig was constructed from Thorlabs parts and was placed inside a custom acoustical cabinet clamped on an air table (Newport, M-VIS3036-SG2-325A). A static head bar fixation clamp and a 3D-printed mouse holder were used to hold a mouse such that its forepaws rest on the steering wheel (86652 and 32019, LEGO) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">The International Brain Laboratory et al., 2021</xref>). Silicone tubing controlled by a pinch valve (225P011-21, NResearch) was used to deliver water rewards to the mouse. The display of the visual stimuli occurred on a LCD screen (LP097Q × 1, LG). To measure the precise times of changes in the visual stimulus, a patch of pixels on the LCD screen flipped between white and black at every stimulus change, and this flip was captured with a photodiode (Bpod Frame2TTL, Sanworks). Ambient temperature, humidity, and barometric air pressure were measured with the Bpod Ambient module (Sanworks), wheel position was monitored with a rotary encoder (05.2400.1122.1024, Kubler).</p>
<p>Videos of the mouse were recorded from 3 angles (left, right and body) with USB cameras (CM3-U3-13Y3M-CS, Point Grey). The left camera acquires at 60Hz; full resolution (1280 x1024), right camera at 150Hz; half resolution (640×512), and body camera at 30Hz; half resolution (640Hzx512). A custom speaker (Hardware Team of the Champalimaud Foundation for the Unknown, V1.1) was used to play task-related sounds, and an ultrasonic microphone (Ultramic UM200K, Dodotronic) was used to record ambient noise from the rig. All task-related data was coordinated by a Bpod State Machine (Sanworks). The task logic was programmed in Python and the visual stimulus presentation and video capture were handled by Bonsai (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Lopes et al., 2015</xref>) utilizing the Bonsai package BonVision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Lopes et al., 2021</xref>).</p>
<p>All recordings were made using Neuropixels probes (Imec, 3A and 3B models), advanced in the brain using a micromanipulator (Sensapex, uMp-4) tilted by a 15 degree angle from the vertical line. The aimed electrode penetration depth was 4.0 mm. Data were acquired via an FPGA (for 3A probes) or PXI (for 3B probes, National Instrument) system and stored on a PC.</p>

<title>Headbar implant surgery</title>
<p>Mice were placed in an induction box with 3-4% isoflurane and maintained at 1.5-2% isoflurane. Saline 10mg/kg subcutaneously is given each hour. The mouse is placed in the stereotaxic frame using ear bars placed in the ridge posterior to the ear canal. The mouse is then prepped for surgery, removing hair from the scalp using epilation creme. Much of the underlying periosteum was removed and bregma and lambda were marked. Then the head was positioned such that there was a 0 degree angle between bregma and lambda in all directions. Lateral and middle tendons are removed using fine forceps. The head bar was then placed in one of three stereotactically defined locations and cemented in place These locations are: AP -6.90, ML +/- 1.25(curved headbar placed caudally onto cerebellum), AP +1.36, ML +/- 1.25 (curved headbar placed rostrally onto frontal zones), and AP -2.95, ML +/-1.25 (straight headbar placed centrally). The location of planned future craniotomies were measured using a pipette referenced to bregma, and marked on the skull using either a surgical blade or pen. A small amount of vetbond was applied to the edges of the skin wound to seal it off and create more surface area.The exposed skull was then covered with cement and clear UV curing glue, ensuring that the remaining scalp was unable to retract from the implant.</p>

<title>Behavioral training and habituation to the ephys rig</title>
<p>All recordings performed in this study were done in expert mice. To reach this status, animals were habituated for three days and trained for several days in the equal probability task version where the Gabor patch appears on the right or left side of the screen with equal probability. Animals are trained to move the visual stimulus controlled by a wheel toward the center of the screen. Animals must reach a ‘trained 1b’ status wherein each of the three consecutive sessions, the mouse completed over 400 trials and performed over 90% on the easy (contrast &gt;= 50%) trials. Additionally, the median reaction time across these sessions must be below 2 seconds for the 0% contrast. Lastly, a psychometric curve is fitted with four parameters bias, lapse right, lapse left and threshold, must meet the following criteria: the absolute bias must be below 10, the threshold below 20, and each lapse below 0.1. Once these conditions are met, animals progress to ‘biasedChoiceWorld’ in which they are first presented with an unbiased block of trials and subsequently blocks are from either of two biased blocks: Gabor patch is presented on the left and right with probabilities of 0.2 and 0.8 (20:80) respectively, and in the other block type the Gabor patch is presented on the left and right with probabilities of 0.8 and 0.2 (80:20) respectively. In summary, once mice learned the biasedChoiceWorld task (criteria ‘ready4ephysRig’ reached), they were habituated to the electrophysiology rig. Briefly, this criterion is met by performing three consecutive sessions that meet ‘trained 1b’ status. Additionally, psychometric curves (separately fit for each block type) must have bias shifts &lt; 5%, and lapse rates measured on asymmetric blocks must be below 0.1. Their first requirement was to perform one session of biasedChoiceWorld on the electrophysiology rig, with at least 400 trials and 90% correct on easy contrasts (collapsing across block types). Once this criterion was reached, time delays were introduced at the beginning of the session; these delays served to mimic the time it would take to insert electrodes in the brain. To be included in subsequent sessions, mice were required to maintain performance for 3 subsequent sessions (same criterion as ‘ready4ephysRig’), with a minimum of one session with a 15-minute pre-session delay. For the analyses in this study, only electrophysiology sessions where the mouse completed at least 400 trials were used.</p>

<title>Data acquisition</title>
<p>Briefly, upon the day of electrophysiological recording, the animal was anaesthetised using isoflurane and surgically prepared. The UV glue was removed using ethanol and a biopsy punch or a scalpel blade. The exposed skull was then checked for infection. A test was made to check whether the implant could hold liquid without leaking to ensure that the brain did not dry during the recording. Subsequently, a grounding pin was cemented to the skull using Metabond. 1-2 craniotomies (1 × 1 mm) were made over the marked locations using a biopsy punch or drill. The dura was left intact, and the brain was lubricated with ACSF. DuraGel was applied over the dura as a moisturising sealant, and covered with a layer of Kwikcast. The mouse was administered analgesics subcutaneously, and left to recover in a heating chamber until locomotor and grooming activity were fully recovered. Once the animal was recovered from the craniotomy, it was relocated to the apparatus. Once a craniotomy was made, up to 4 subsequent recording sessions were made in that same craniotomy. Up to two probes were implanted in the brain on a given session.</p>

<title>Probe track labeling</title>
<p>CM-Dil (V22888, Thermofisher) was used to label probes for subsequent histology. CM-Dil was strored in the freezer -at 20C until ready for use. On the day of recording, we thawed CM-Dil at room temperature, protecting it from light. Labeling took place under a microscope while the Neuropixels probe was secured onto a micromanipulator, electrode sites facing up. 1uL of CM-Dil was placed onto either a coverslip or parafilm. Using the micromanipulator, the probe tip was inserted into the drop of dye with care taken to not get dye onto the electrode sites. For Neuropixels probes, the tip extends about 150um from the first electrode site. The tip is kept in the dye until the drop dries out completely (approximately 30 seconds) and then the micromanipulator is slowly retracted to remove the probe).</p>

<title>Spike sorting</title>
<p>Raw electrophysiological recordings were initially saved in a flat uncompressed binary format, representing a storage of 1.3GB per minute. To save disk space and achieve better transfer speeds we utilized simple lossless compression to achieve a compression ratio between 2x and 3x. In many cases, we encounter line noise due to voltage leakage on the probe. This translates into large “stripes” of noise spanning the whole probe. To reduce the impact of these noise “stripes” we perform three main pre-processing steps including: (1) correction for “sample shift” along the length of the probe by aligning the samples with a frequency domain approach; (2) automatic detection, rejection and interpolation of failing channels; (3) application of a spatial “de-striping” filter. After these preprocessing steps, spike sorting was performed using PyKilosort 1.4.7, a Python port of the Kilosort 2.5 algorithm that includes modifications to preprocessing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Steinmetz et al., 2021</xref>). At this step, we apply registration, clustering, and spike deconvolution. We found it necessary to improve the original code in several aspects (e.g., improved modularity and documentation, and better memory handling for datasets with many spikes) and developed an open-source Python port; the code repository is here: (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">The International Brain Laboratory, 2021</xref><italic>b</italic>).

<title>Single cluster quality metrics</title>
<p>To determine whether a single cluster will be used in downstream analysis, we used three metrics (listed as part of RIGOR in <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>): the refractory period, an amplitude cut-off estimate, and the median of the amplitudes. First, we developed a metric which estimates whether a neuron is contaminated by refractory period violations (indicating potential overmerge problems in the clustering step) without assuming the length of the refractory period. For each of the many refractory period lengths, we compute the number of spikes (refractory period violations) that would correspond to some maximum acceptable amount of contamination (chosen as 10%). We then compute the likelihood of observing fewer than this number of spikes in that refractory period under the assumption of Poisson spiking. For a neuron to pass this metric, this likelihood that our neuron is less than 10% contaminated, must be larger than 90% for any one of the possible refractory period lengths.</p>
<p>Next, we compute an amplitude cut-off estimate. This metric estimates whether an amplitude distribution is cut off by thresholding in the deconvolution step (thus leading to a large fraction of missed spikes). To do so, we compare the lowest bin of the histogram (the number of neurons with the lowest amplitudes), to the bins in the highest quantile of the distribution (defined as the top 1/4 of bins higher than the peak of the distribution.) Specifically, we compute how many standard deviations the height of the low bin falls outside of the mean of the height of the bins in the high quantile. For a neuron to pass this metric, this value must be less than 5 standard deviations, and the height of the lowest bin must be less than 10% of the height of the peak histogram bin.</p>
<p>Finally, we compute the median of the amplitudes. For a neuron to pass this metric, the median of the amplitudes must be larger than 50 uV.</p>

<title>Local field potential (LFP)</title>
<p>Concurrently with the action potential band, each channel of the Neuropixel probe recorded a low-pass filtered trace at a sampling rate of 2500 Hz. A denoising was applied to the raw data, comprising four steps. First a Butterworth low-cut filter is applied on the time traces, with 2Hz corner frequency and order 3. Then a subsample shift was applied to rephase each channel according to the time-sampling difference due to sequential sampling of the hardware. Then faulty bad channels were automatically identified, removed and interpolated. Finally, the median reference is subtracted at each time sample. See <italic>The International Brain Laboratory et al.</italic> (<italic>2022a</italic>) for full details. After this processing, the power spectral density at different frequencies was estimated per channel using the Welch’s method with partly overlapping Hanning windows of 1024 samples. Power spectral density (PSD) was converted into dB as follows:

<title>Serial section two-photon imaging</title>
<p>Mice were given a terminal dose of pentobarbital intraperitoneally. The toe-pinch test was performed as confirmation that the mouse was deeply anesthetized before proceeding with the surgical procedure. Thoracic cavity was opened, the atrium was cut, and PBS followed by 4% formaldehyde solution (Thermofisher 28908) in 0.1M PB pH 7.4 were perfused through the left ventricle. The whole mouse brain was dissected and post-fixed in the same fixative for a minimum of 24 hours at room temperature. Tissues were washed and stored for up to 2-3 weeks in PBS at 4C, prior to shipment to the Sainsbury Wellcome Centre for image acquisition.</p>
<p>The brains were embedded in agarose and imaged in a water bath filled with 50 mM PB using a 4 kHz resonant scanning serial section two-photon microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Ragan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Economo et al., 2016</xref>). The microscope was controlled with ScanImage Basic (Vidrio Technologies, USA), and BakingTray, a custom software wrapper for setting up the imaging parameters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Campbell, 2020</xref>). Image tiles were assembled into 2D planes using StitchIt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Campbell, 2021</xref>). Whole brain coronal image stacks were acquired at a resolution of 4.4 x 4.4 x 25.0 µm in XYZ (Nikon 16x NA 0.8), with a two-photon laser wavelength of 920 nm, and approximately 150 mW at the sample. The microscope cut 50 µm sections using a vibratome (Leica VT1000) but imaged two optical planes within each slice at depths of about 30 µm and 55 µm from the tissue surface using a PIFOC. Two channels of image data were acquired simultaneously using Hamamatsu R10699 multialkali PMTs: ‘Green’ at 525 nm ±25 nm (Crhoma ET525/50m); ‘Red’ at 570 nm low pass (Chroma ET570lp).</p>
<p>Whole brain images were downsampled to 25 µm isotropic voxels and registered to the adult mouse Allen common coordinate framework (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Wang et al., 2020</xref>) using BrainRegister (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">West, 2021</xref>), an elastix-based (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Klein et al., 2010</xref>) registration pipeline with optimised parameters for mouse brain registration.

<title>Probe track tracing and alignment</title>
<p>Tracing of Neuropixels electrode tracks was performed on registered image stacks. This is performed by the experimenter and an additional member. Neuropixels probe tracks were manually traced to yield a probe trajectory using Lasagna (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Campbell et al., 2020</xref>), a Python-based image viewer equipped with a plugin tailored for this task. Tracing was performed on the merged images on the green (auto-fluorescence) and red (CM-Dil labeling) channels, using both coronal and sagittal views. Traced probe track data was uploaded to an Alyx server (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Rossant et al., 2021</xref>); a database designed for experimental neuroscience laboratories. Neu-ropixels channels were then manually aligned to anatomical features along the trajectory using electrophysiological landmarks with a custom electrophysiology alignment tool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Faulkner, 2020</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Liu et al., 2021</xref>).</p>

<title>Permutation tests and power analysis</title>
<p>We use permutation tests to study the reproducibility of neural features across laboratories. To this end, we first defined a test statistic that is sensitive to systematic deviations in the distributions of features between laboratories: the maximum absolute difference between the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of a neural feature within one lab and the CDF across all other labs (similar to the test statistic used for a Kolmogorov–Smirnov test). For the CDF, each mouse might contribute just a single value (e.g. in the case of the deviations from the target region), or a number for every neuron in that mouse (e.g. in the case of comparing firing rate differences during specific time-periods). The deviations between CDFs from all the individual labs are then reduced into one number by considering only the deviation of the lab with the strongest such deviation, giving us a metric that quantifies the difference between lab distributions. The null hypothesis is that there is no difference between the different laboratory distributions, i.e. the assignment of mice to laboratories is completely random. We sampled from the corresponding null distribution by permuting the assignments between laboratories and mice randomly 50,000 times (leaving the relative numbers of mice in laboratories intact) and computing the test statistic on these randomised samples. Given this sampled null distribution, the p-value of the permutation test is the proportion of the null distribution that has more extreme values than the test statistic that was computed on the real data.</p>
<p>For the power analysis (<xref rid="fig4s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 4, Supp. Fig 2</xref>), the goal was to find how much each value (firing rate modulations or Fano factors) would need to shift within the individual labs to create a significant p-value for any given test. This grants us a better understanding of the workings and limits of our test. As we chose an <italic>a</italic> level of 0.01, we needed to find the perturbations that gave a p-value <italic>&lt;</italic> 0.01. To achieve this for a given test and a given lab, we took the values of every neuron within that lab, and shifted them all up or down by a certain amount. We used binary search to find the exact points at which such an up- or down-shift caused the test to become significant. This analysis tells us exactly at which points our test becomes significant, and importantly, ensures that our permutation test is sensitive enough to detect deviations of a given magnitudes. It may seem counter intuitive that some tests allow for larger deviations than others, or that even within the same test some labs have a different range of possible perturbations than others. This is because the test considers the entire distribution of values, resulting in possibly complex interactions between the labs. Precisely because of these interactions of the data with the test, we performed a thorough power analysis to ensure that our procedure is sufficiently sensitive to across-lab variations. The bottom row of <xref rid="fig4s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 4, Supp. Fig 2</xref> shows the overall distribution of permissible shifts, the large majority of which is below one standard deviation of the corresponding lab distribution.</p>

<title>Dimensionality reduction of PETHs via principal component analysis</title>
<p>The analyses in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref> rely on principal component analysis (PCA) to embed PETHs into a two-dimensional feature space. Our overall approach is to compute PETHs, split into fast-reaction-time and slow-reaction-time trials, then concatenate these PETH vectors for each cell to obtain a summary of each cell’s activity. Next we stack these double PETHs from all labs into a single matrix. Finally, we used PCA to obtain a low-rank approximation of this PETH matrix.</p>
<p>In detail, the two PETHs consist of one averaging fast reaction time (<italic>&lt;</italic> 0.15<italic>sec</italic>, 0.15<italic>sec</italic> being the mean reaction time when considering the distribution of reaction times across all sessions) trials and the other slow reaction time (<italic>&gt;</italic> 0.15<italic>sec</italic>) trials, each of length <italic>T</italic> time steps. We used 20 ms bins, from −0.5 sec to 1.5 sec relative to motion onset, so <italic>T</italic> = 100. We also performed a simple normalization on each PETH, subtracting baseline activity and then dividing the firing rates by the baseline firing rate (prior to motion onset) of each cell plus a small positive offset term (to avoid amplifying noise in very low-firing cells), following <italic>Steinmetz et al.</italic> (<italic>2019</italic>).</p>
<p>Let the stack of these double PETH vectors be <italic>Y</italic>, being a <italic>N</italic> × 2<italic>T</italic> matrix, where <italic>N</italic> is the total number of neurons recorded across 5 brain regions and labs. Running principal components analysis (PCA) on <italic>Y</italic> (singular value decomposition) is used to obtain the low-rank approximation <italic>UV</italic> ≅ <italic>Y</italic>. This provides a simple low-d embedding of each cell: <italic>U</italic> is <italic>N</italic> × <italic>k</italic>, with each row of <italic>U</italic> representing a <italic>k</italic>-dimensional embedding of a cell that can be visualized easily across labs and brain regions. <italic>V</italic> is <italic>k</italic> × 2<italic>T</italic> and corresponds to the <italic>k</italic> temporal basis functions that PCA learns to best approximate <italic>Y</italic>. <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5a</xref> shows the responses of two cells of <italic>Y</italic> (black traces) and the corresponding PCA approximation from <italic>UV</italic> (red traces).</p>

<title>Linear regression model to quantify the contribution of spatial and spike features to variability</title>
<p>To fit a linear regression model to the session-averaged firing rate of neurons, for each brain region, we used a Nx5 predictor matrix where N is the number of recorded neurons within the region. The five columns contain the following five covariates for each neuron: x, y, z position, spike amplitude, and spike peak-to-trough duration. The Nx1 observation matrix consisted of the average firing rate for each neuron throughout the entire recording period. The linear model was fit using ordinary least-squares without regularization. The unadjusted coefficient of determination (<italic>R</italic>2) was used to report the level of variability in neuronal firing rates explained by the model.</p>

<title>Video analysis</title>
<p>In the recording rigs, we used three cameras, one called ‘left’ at full resolution (1280×1024) and 60 Hz filming the mouse from one side, one called ‘right’ at half resolution (640×512) and 150 Hz, filming the mouse symmetrically from the other side, and one called ‘body’ filming the trunk of the mouse from above. Several quality control metrics were developed to detect video issues such as poor illumination or accidental misplacement of the cameras.</p>
<p>We used DeepLabCut (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Mathis et al., 2018</xref>) to track various body parts such as the paws, nose, tongue, and pupil. The pipeline first detects 4 regions of interest (ROI) in each frame, crops these ROIs using ffmpeg (<italic>Tomar, 2006</italic>) and applies a separate network for each ROI to track features. For each side video we track the following points:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>ROI eye:</p></list-item>
</list>
‘pupil_top_r’, ‘pupil_right_r’, ‘pupil_bottom_r’, ‘pupil_left_r’
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>ROI mouth:</p></list-item>

‘tongue_end_r’, ‘tongue_end_l’
<list list-type="bullet">

</list>
‘nose_tip’
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>ROI paws:</p></list-item>
</list>
‘paw_r’, ‘paw_l’</p>
<p>The right side video was flipped and spatially up-sampled to look like the left side video, such that we could apply the same DeepLabCut networks. The code is available here: (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">The International Brain Laboratory, 2021</xref><italic>a</italic>).</p>
<p>Extensive curating of the training set of images for each network was required to obtain reliable tracking across animals and laboratories. We annotated in total more than 10K frames, across several iterations, using a semi-automated tracking failure detection approach, which found frames with temporal jumps, three-dimensional re-projection errors when combining both side views, and heuristic measures of spatial violations. These selected ‘bad’ frames were then annotated and the network re-trained. To find further raw video and DeepLabCut issues, we inspected trial-averaged behaviors obtained from the tracked features, such as licking aligned to feedback time, paw speed aligned to stimulus onset and scatter plots of animal body parts across a session superimposed onto example video frames. See <italic>The International Brain Laboratory</italic> (<italic>2021a</italic>) for full details.</p>
<p>Despite the large labeled dataset and multiple network retraining iterations described above, DeepLabCut was not able to achieve sufficiently reliable tracking of the paws or pupils. Therefore we used an improved tracking method, Lightning Pose, for these body parts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Biderman et al., 2023</xref>). Lightning Pose models were trained on the same final labeled dataset used to train DeepLabCut. We then applied the Ensemble Kalman Smoother (EKS) post-processor introduced in <italic>Biderman et al.</italic> (<italic>2023</italic>), which incorporates information across multiple networks trained on different train/validation splits of the data. For the paw data, we used a version of EKS that further incorporates information across the left and right camera views in order to resolve occlusions.

<title>Data preprocessing</title>
<p>For the multi-task neural network (MTNN) analysis, we used data from 32 sessions recorded in SWC, CCU, CSHL (C), UCL, Berkeley, NYU, UCLA, and UW. We filtered out the sessions with unreliable behavioral traces from video analysis and selected labs with at least 4 sessions for the MTNN analysis. For the labs with more than 4 sessions, we selected sessions with more recorded neurons across all repeated sites. We included various covariates in our feature set (e.g. go-cue signals, stimulus/reward type, DeepLabCut/Lightning Pose behavioral outputs). For the “decision strategy” covariate, we used the posterior estimated state probabilities of the 4-state GLM-HMMs trained on the sessions used for the MTNN analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Ashwood et al., 2021</xref>). Both biased and unbiased data were used when training the 4-state model. For each session, we first filtered out the trials where no choice is made. We then selected the trials whose stimulus onset time is no more than 0.4 seconds before the first movement onset time and feedback time is no more than 0.9 seconds after the first movement onset time. Finally, we selected responsive neurons whose mean firing rate is greater than 5 spikes/second for further analyses.</p>
<p>The lab IDs and session IDs were each encoded in a “one-hot” format (i.e., each lab is encoded as a length 8 one-hot vector). For the leave-one-out effect size of the session IDs, we compared the model trained with all of the covariates in <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> against the model trained without the session IDs. For the leave-one-out effect size of the lab IDs, we compared the model trained without the lab IDs against the model trained without both the lab and session IDs. We prevented the lab and session IDs from containing overlapping information with this encoding scheme, where the lab IDs cannot be predicted from the session IDs, and vice versa, during the leave-one-out analysis.</p>

<title>Model training</title>
<p>The model was implemented in PyTorch and trained on a single GPU. The training was performed using Stochastic Gradient Descent on the Poisson negative loglikelihood (Poisson NLL) loss with learning rate set to 0.1, momentum set to 0.9, and weight decay set to 10−15. We used a learning rate scheduler such that the learning rate for the <italic>i</italic>-th epoch is 0.1 × 0.95<italic>i</italic>, and the dropout rate was set to 0.15. We also experimented with mean squared error (MSE) loss instead of Poisson NLL loss, and the results were similar. The batch size was set to 1024.</p>
<p>The dataset consists of 32 sessions, 1133 neurons and 11490 active trials in total. For each session, 20% of the trials are used as the test data and the remaining trials are split 20:80 for the validation and training sets. During training, the performance on the held-out validation set is checked after every 3 passes through the training data. The model is trained for 100 epochs, and the model parameters with the best performance on the held-out validation set are saved and used for predictions on the test data.</p>

<title>Simulated experiments</title>
<p>For the simulated experiment in <xref rid="fig7s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 7-supplemental 2</xref>, we first trained GLMs on the same set of 1133 responsive neurons from 32 sessions used for the analysis in <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7d</xref> and <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7e</xref>, with a reduced set of covariates consisting of stimulus timing, stimulus side and contrast, first movement onset timing, feedback type and timing, wheel velocity, and mouse’s priors for the current and previous trials. The kernels of the trained GLMs show the contribution of each of the covariates to the firing rates of each neuron. For each simulated neuron, we used these kernels of the trained GLM to simulate its firing rates for 500 randomly initialized trials. The random trials were 1.5 seconds long with 50 ms bin width. For all trials, the first movement onset timing was set to 0.5 second after the start of the trial, and the stimulus contrast, side, onset timing and feedback type, timing were randomly sampled. We used wheel velocity traces and mouse’s priors from real data for simulation. We finally ran the leave-one-out analyses with GLMs/MTNN on the simulated data and compared the effect sizes estimated by GLMs and MTNN.</p>

<caption><title>Neuronal subtypes and firing rates.</title>
<p>High-firing neurons do not belong to a specific cell subtype. To identify putative Fast-Spiking (FS) and Regular-Spiking (RS) neuronal populations, we examined spike peak-to-trough durations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Jia et al., 2019</xref>). This distribution was bimodal in Visa/am, CA1, and DG, but not LP and PO (as expected from <italic>Jia et al.</italic> (<italic>2019</italic>)). This bimodality (indicated with the black and blue boxes) suggests distinct populations of FS and RS neurons only in cortical and hippocampal regions, which should have narrow (black) and wide (blue) spike widths, respectively. To confirm the distinct populations of FS and RS neurons, we next plotted the cumulative probability of firing rate for these two putative neuronal categories. Indeed, in cortex and hippocampus, neurons with narrow spikes tend to have higher firing rates (in black) while neurons with wider spikes have lower firing rates (in blue). In contrast, in LP and PO, we did not identify specific populations of neuronal subtypes using the spike waveform (to our knowledge, this has not been done in previous work either). Importantly, even in cortex/hippocampus where putative RS and FS neurons are distinguishable, there is still a large firing rate overlap between these two groups, especially for firing rates above 11-19 sp/s (the firing rate thresholds from <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref> and supplemental figures). Hence, high-firing neurons do not seem to belong to only a specific neuronal subtype.</p></caption>

First, given an MTNN model trained with the full set of covariates listed in <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, we created four different MTNN models by perturbing the weights for the lab IDs. One is a model with the originally learned weights for the lab IDs (”Original lab weights”). The other three models have (randomly sampled) orthogonal weights for the lab IDs, where the l2 norms of the weights for the first and last labs (i.e., the labs with lab IDs 1 and 8) are set to <italic>a</italic> and <italic>b</italic>, respectively (”Perturbed lab weights, Varying l2 norm: <italic>a</italic>-<italic>b</italic>”). The l2 norms of the weights for the labs in between (i.e., the labs with lab IDs from 2 to 7) are set to values equally spaced between <italic>a</italic> and <italic>b</italic>. We then generated four different sets of datasets by running the models forward with the original features that are used to train, validate and test the model. Finally, we reran the MTNN leave-one-out analysis for the lab IDs with each simulated dataset. Each dot in each column represents the change in prediction quality (measured by <italic>R</italic>2) for each neuron in the dataset, when the lab IDs are left out from the set of covariates.</p></caption>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors explore a large-scale electrophysiological dataset collected in 10 labs while mice performed the same behavioral task, and aim to establish guidelines to aid reproducibility of results collected across labs. They introduce a series of metrics for quality control of electrophysiological data and show that histological verification of recording sites is important for interpreting findings across labs and should be reported in addition to planned coordinates. Furthermore, the authors suggest that although basic electrophysiology features were comparable across labs, task modulation of single neurons can be variable, particularly for some brain regions. The authors then use a multi-task neural network model to examine how neural dynamics relate to multiple interacting task- and experimenter-related variables, and find that lab-specific differences contribute little to the variance observed. Therefore, analysis approaches that account for correlated behavioral variables are important for establishing reproducible results when working with electrophysiological data from animals performing decision-making tasks. This paper is very well-motivated and needed. However, what is missing is a direct comparison of task modulation of neurons across labs using standard analysis practice in the fields, such as generalized linear model (GLM). This can potentially clarify how much behavioral variance contributes to the neural variance across labs; and more accurately estimate the scale of the issues of reproducibility in behavioral systems neuroscience, where conclusions often depend on these standard analysis methods.</p>
<p>Strength:</p>
<p>(1) This is a well-motivated paper that addresses the critical question of reproducibility in behavioural systems neuroscience. The authors should be commended for their efforts.</p>
<p>(2) A key strength of this study comes from the large dataset collected in collaboration across ten labs. This allows the authors to assess lab-to-lab reproducibility of electrophysiological data in mice performing the same decision-making task.</p>
<p>(3) The authors' attempt to streamline preprocessing pipelines and quality metrics is highly relevant in a field that is collecting increasingly large-scale datasets where automation of these steps is increasingly needed.</p>
<p>(4) Another major strength is the release of code repositories to streamline preprocessing pipelines across labs collecting electrophysiological data.</p>
<p>(5) Finally, the application of MTNN for characterizing functional modulation of neurons, although not yet widely used in systems neuroscience, seems to have several advantages over traditional methods.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) In several places the assumptions about standard practices in the field, including preprocessing and analyses of electrophysiology data, seem to be inaccurately presented:</p>
<p>a) The estimation of how much the histologically verified recording location differs from the intended recording location is valuable information. Importantly, this paper provides citable evidence for why that is important. However, histological verification of recording sites is standard practice in the field, even if not all studies report them. Although we appreciate the authors' effort to further motivate this practice, the current description in the paper may give readers outside the field a false impression of the level of rigor in the field.</p>
<p>b) When identifying which and how neurons encode particular aspects of stimuli or behaviour in behaving animals (when variables are correlated by the nature of the animals behaviour), it has become the standard in behavioral systems neuroscience to use GLMs - indeed many labs participating in the IBL also has a long history of doing this (e.g., Steinmetz et al., 2019; Musall et al., 2023; Orsolic et al., 2021; Park et al., 2014). The reproducibility of results when using GLMs is never explicitly shown, but the supplementary figures to Figure 7 indicate that results may be reproducible across labs when using GLMs (as it has similar prediction performance to the MTNN). This should be introduced as the first analysis method used in a new dedicated figure (i.e., following Figure 3 and showing results of analyses similar to what was shown for the MTNN in Figure 7). This will help put into perspective the degree of reproducibility issues the field is facing when analyzing with appropriate and common methods. The authors can then go on to show how simpler approaches (currently in Figures 4 and 5) - not accounting for a lot of uncontrolled variabilities when working with behaving animals - may cause reproducibility issues.</p>
<p>When the authors introduce a neural network approach (i.e. MTNN) as an alternative to the analyses in Figures 4 and 5, they suggest: 'generalized linear models (GLMs) are likely too inflexible to capture the nonlinear contributions that many of these variables, including lab identity and spatial positions of neurons, might make to neural activity'). This is despite the comparison between MTNN and GLM prediction performance (Supplement 1 to Figure 7) showing that the MTNN is only slightly better at predicting neural activity compared to standard GLMs. The introduction of new models to capture neural variability is always welcome, but the conclusion that standard analyses in the field are not reproducible can be unfair unless directly compared to GLMs.</p>
<p>In essence, it is really useful to demonstrate how different analysis methods and preprocessing approaches affect reproducibility. But the authors should highlight what is actually standard in the field, and then provide suggestions to improve from there.</p>
<p>(2) The authors attempt to establish a series of new quality control metrics for the inclusion of recordings and single units. This is much needed, with the goal to standardize unit inclusion across labs that bypasses the manual process while keeping the nuances from manual curation. However, the authors should benchmark these metrics to other automated metrics and to manual curation, which is still a gold standard in the field. The authors did this for whole-session assessment but not for individual clusters. If the authors can find metrics that capture agreed-upon manual cluster labels, without the need for manual intervention, that would be extremely helpful for the field.</p>
<p>(3) With the goal of improving reproducibility and providing new guidelines for standard practice for data analysis, the authors should report of n of cells, sessions, and animals used in plots and analyses throughout the paper to aid both understanding of the variability in the plots - but also to set a good example.</p>
<p>Other general comments:</p>
<p>(1) In the discussion (line 383) the authors conclude: 'This is reassuring, but points to the need for large sample sizes of neurons to overcome the inherent variability of single neuron recording'. - Based on what is presented in this paper we would rather say that their results suggest that appropriate analytical choices are needed to ensure reproducibility, rather than large datasets - and they need to show whether using standard GLMs actually allows for reproducible results.</p>
<p>(2) A general assumption in the across-lab reproducibility questions in the paper relies on intralab variability vs across-lab variability. An alternative measure that may better reflect experimental noise is across-researcher variability, as well as the amount of experimenter experience (if the latter is a factor, it could suggest researchers may need more training before collecting data for publication). The authors state in the discussion that this is not possible. But maybe certain measures can be used to assess this (e.g. years of conducting surgeries/ephys recordings etc)?</p>
<p>(3) Figure 3b and c: Are these plots before or after the probe depth has been adjusted based on physiological features such as the LFP power? In other words, is the IBL electrophysiological alignment toolbox used here and is the reliability of location before using physiological criteria or after? Beyond clarification, showing both before and after would help the readers to understand how much the additional alignment based on electrophysiological features adjusts probe location. It would also be informative if they sorted these penetrations by which penetrations were closest to the planned trajectory after histological verification.</p>
<p>(4) In Figures 4 and 6: If the authors use a 0.05 threshold (alpha) and a cell simply has to be significant on 1/6 tests to be considered task modulated, that means that they have a false positive rate of ~30% (0.05*6=0.3). We ran a simple simulation looking for significant units (from random null distribution) from these criteria which shows that out of 100.000 units, 26500 units would come out significant (false error rate: 26.5%). That is very high (and unlikely to be accepted in most papers), and therefore not surprising that the fraction of task-modulated units across labs is highly variable. This high false error rate may also have implications for the investigation of the spatial position of task-modulated units (as effects of the spatial position may drown in falsely labelled 'task-modulated' cells).</p>
<p>(5) The authors state from Figure 5b that the majority of cells could be well described by 2 PCs. The distribution of R2 across neurons is almost uniform, so depending on what R2 value one considers a 'good' description, that is the fraction of 'good' cells. Furthermore, movement onset has now been well-established to be affecting cells widely and in large fractions, so while this analysis may work for something with global influence - like movement - more sparsely encoded variables (as many are in the brain) may not be well approximated with this suggestion. The authors could expand this analysis into other epochs like activity around stimulus presentation, to better understand how this type of analysis reproduces across labs for features that have a less global influence.</p>
<p>(6) Additionally, in Figure 5i: could the finding that one can only distinguish labs when taking cells from all regions, simply be a result of a different number of cells recorded in each region for each lab? It makes more sense to focus on the lab/area pairing as the authors also do, but not to make their main conclusion from it. If the authors wish to do the comparison across regions, they will need to correct for the number of cells recorded in each region for each lab. In general, it was a struggle to fully understand the purpose of Figure 5. While population analysis and dimensionality reduction are commonplace, this seems to be a very unusual use of it.</p>
<p>(7) In the discussion the authors state: &quot;This approach, which exceeds what is done in many experimental labs&quot;. Indeed this approach is a more effective and streamlined way of doing it, but it is questionable whether it 'exceeds' what is done in many labs. Classically, scientists trace each probe manually with light microscopy and designate each area based on anatomical landmarks identified with nissl or dapi stains together with gross landmarks. When not automated with 2-PI serial tomography and anatomically aligned to a standard atlas, this is a less effective process, but it is not clear that it is less precise, especially in studies before neuropixels where active electrodes were located in a much smaller area. While more effective, transforming into a common atlas does make additional assumptions about warping the brain into the standard atlas - especially in cases where the brain has been damaged/lesioned. Readers can appreciate the effectiveness and streamlining provided by these new tools without the need to invalidate previous approaches.</p>
<p>(8) What about across-lab population-level representation of task variables, such as in the coding direction for stimulus or choice? Is the general decodability of task variables from the population comparable across labs?</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors sought to evaluate whether observations made in separate individual laboratories are reproducible when they use standardized procedures and quality control measures. This is a key question for the field. If ten systems neuroscience labs try very hard to do the exact same experiment and analyses, do they get the same core results? If the answer is no, this is very bad news for everyone else! Fortunately, they were able to reproduce most of their experimental findings across all labs. Despite attempting to target the same brain areas in each recording, variability in electrode targeting was a source of some differences between datasets.</p>
<p>Major Comments:</p>
<p>The paper had two principal goals:</p>
<p>
(1) to assess reproducibility between labs on a carefully coordinated experiment</p>
<p>
(2) distill the knowledge learned into a set of standards that can be applied across the field.</p>
<p>
The manuscript made progress towards both of these goals but leaves room for improvement.</p>
<p>(1) The first goal of the study was to perform exactly the same experiment and analyses across 10 different labs and see if you got the same results. The rationale for doing this was to test how reproducible large-scale rodent systems neuroscience experiments really are. In this, the study did a great job showing that when a consortium of labs went to great lengths to do everything the same, even decoding algorithms could not discern laboratory identity was not clearly from looking at the raw data. However, the amount of coordination between the labs was so great that these findings are hard to generalize to the situation where similar (or conflicting!) results are generated by two labs working independently.</p>
<p>Importantly, the study found that electrode placement (and thus likely also errors inherent to the electrode placement reconstruction pipeline) was a key source of variability between datasets. To remedy this, they implemented a very sophisticated electrode reconstruction pipeline (involving two-photon tomography and multiple blinded data validators) in just one lab-and all brains were sliced and reconstructed in this one location. This is a fantastic approach for ensuring similar results within the IBL collaboration, but makes it unclear how much variance would have been observed if each lab had attempted to reconstruct their probe trajectories themselves using a mix of histology techniques from conventional brain slicing, to light sheet microscopy, to MRI imaging.</p>
<p>This approach also raises a few questions. The use of standard procedures, pipelines, etc. is a great goal, but most labs are trying to do something unique with their setup. Bigger picture, shouldn't highly &quot;significant&quot; biological findings akin to the discovery of place cells or grid cells, be so clear and robust that they can be identified with different recording modalities and analysis pipelines?</p>
<p>Related to this, how many labs outside of the IBL collaboration have implemented the IBL pipeline for their own purposes? In what aspects do these other labs find it challenging to reproduce the approaches presented in the paper? If labs were supposed to perform this same experiment, but without coordinating directly, how much more variance between labs would have been seen? Obviously investigating these topics is beyond the scope of this paper. The current manuscript is well-written and clear as is, and I think it is a valuable contribution to the field. However, some additional discussion of these issues would be helpful.</p>
<p>(2) The second goal of the study was to present a set of data curation standards (RIGOR) that could be applied widely across the field. This is a great idea, but its implementation needs to be improved if adoption outside of the IBL is to be expected. Here are three issues:</p>
<p>(a) The GitHub repo for this project (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/int-brain-lab/paper-reproducible-ephys/">https://github.com/int-brain-lab/paper-reproducible-ephys/</ext-link>) is nicely documented if the reader's goal is to reproduce the figures in the manuscript. Consequently, the code for producing the RIGOR statistics seems mostly designed for re-computing statistics on the existing IBL-formatted datasets. There doesn't appear to be any clear documentation about how to run it on arbitrary outputs from a spike sorter (i.e. the inputs to Phy).</p>
<p>(b) Other sets of spike sorting metrics that are more easily computed for labs that are not using the IBL pipeline already exist (e.g. &quot;quality_metrics&quot; from the Allen Institute ecephys pipeline [<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/AllenInstitute/ecephys_spike_sorting/blob/main/ecephys_spike_sorting/modules/quality_metrics/README.md">https://github.com/AllenInstitute/ecephys_spike_sorting/blob/main/ecephys_spike_sorting/modules/quality_metrics/README.md</ext-link>] and the similar module in the Spike Interface package [<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://spikeinterface.readthedocs.io/en/latest/modules/qualitymetrics.html]">https://spikeinterface.readthedocs.io/en/latest/modules/qualitymetrics.html]</ext-link>). The manuscript does not compare these approaches to those proposed here, but some of the same statistics already exist (amplitude cutoff, median spike amplitude, refractory period violation).</p>
<p>(c) Some of the RIGOR criteria are qualitative and must be visually assessed manually. Conceptually, these features make sense to include as metrics to examine, but would ideally be applied in a standardized way across the field. The manuscript doesn't appear to contain a detailed protocol for how to assess these features. A procedure for how to apply these criteria for curating non-IBL data (or for implementing an automated classifier) would be helpful.</p>
<p>Other Comments:</p>
<p>(1) How did the authors select the metrics they would use to evaluate reproducibility? Was this selection made before doing the study?</p>
<p>(2) Was reproducibility within-lab dependent on experimenter identity?</p>
<p>(3) They note that UCLA and UW datasets tended to miss deeper brain region targets (lines 185-188) - they do not speculate why these labs show systematic differences. Were they not following standardized procedures?</p>
<p>(4) The authors suggest that geometrical variance (difference between planned and final identified probe position acquired from reconstructed histology) in probe placement at the brain surface is driven by inaccuracies in defining the stereotaxic coordinate system, including discrepancies between skull landmarks and the underlying brain structures. In this case, the use of skull landmarks (e.g. bregma) to determine locations of brain structures might be unreliable and provide an error of ~360 microns. While it is known that there is indeed variance in the position between skull landmarks and brain areas in different animals, the quantification of this error is a useful value for the field.</p>
<p>(5) Why are the thalamic recording results particularly hard to reproduce? Does the anatomy of the thalamus simply make it more sensitive to small errors in probe positioning relative to the other recorded areas?</p>
