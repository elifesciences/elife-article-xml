<title>Abstract</title><p>Mammalian mRNAs possess an N7-methylguanosine (m7G) cap and 2’O methylation of the initiating nucleotide at their 5’ end, whereas certain viral RNAs lack these characteristic features. The human antiviral restriction factor IFIT1 recognizes and binds to specific viral RNAs that lack the 5’ features of host mRNAs, resulting in targeted suppression of viral RNA translation. This interaction imposes significant host-driven evolutionary pressures on viruses, and many viruses have evolved mechanisms to evade the antiviral action of human IFIT1. However, little is known about the virus-driven pressures that may have shaped the antiviral activity of IFIT1 genes across mammals. Here, we take an evolution-guided approach to show that the IFIT1 gene is rapidly evolving in multiple mammalian clades, with positive selection acting upon several residues in distinct regions of the protein. In functional assays with 39 IFIT1s spanning diverse mammals, we demonstrate that IFIT1 exhibits a range of antiviral phenotypes, with many orthologs lacking antiviral activity against viruses that are strongly suppressed by other IFIT1s. We further show that IFIT1s from human and a bat, the black flying fox, inhibit Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV) and strongly bind to Cap0 RNAs. Unexpectedly, chimpanzee IFIT1, which differs from human IFIT1 by only 8 amino acids, does not inhibit VEEV infection and exhibits minimal Cap0 RNA-binding. In mutagenesis studies, we determine that amino acids 364 and 366, with the latter undergoing positive selection, are sufficient to confer the differential anti-VEEV activity between human and chimpanzee IFIT1. These data suggest that virus-host genetic conflicts have influenced the antiviral specificity of IFIT1 across diverse mammalian orders.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p><underline>I</underline>nter<underline>f</underline>eron-<underline>i</underline>nduced protein with <underline>t</underline>etratricopeptide repeats <underline>1</underline> (IFIT1) is an interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) that is capable of distinguishing between self and non-self RNA. Mammalian mRNAs possess an N7-methylguanosine (m7G) cap and 2′O methylation of the initiating nucleotide at their 5’ end. Many viral RNAs, however, lack these characteristic features. IFIT1 is able to recognize and bind viral RNAs that lack a m7G cap, including 5’ triphosphate (5’-ppp-RNA) or viral RNAs that possess a m7G cap but lack 2′O methylation of the initiating nucleotide (Cap0 RNA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>). Crystal structures of human IFIT1 bound to both 5’-ppp-RNA and Cap0 RNA have helped uncover biochemical and structural determinants of IFIT1 antiviral activity, including residues that confer RNA-binding properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>). IFIT1 binding to viral RNA subsequently inhibits infection by decreasing the amount of accessible RNA from the pool of replicating viral RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>) and by interacting with eIF proteins required for translation of viral proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>).</p>
<p>Viral restriction via IFIT1 binding to non-self RNAs imposes a host-driven evolutionary pressure for viruses to evade the antiviral function of IFIT1, as many viruses have evolved various mechanisms to elude IFIT1 binding and viral suppression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>). This includes viruses encoding their own capping and 2’O methyltransferase enzymes, using internal ribosome entry sites (IRES) to allow cap-independent translation of viral proteins, using host mRNA caps through cap-snatching, or hindering IFIT1 binding with RNA structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>). For the alphavirus Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV), which has a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA (+ssRNA) genome, a secondary RNA structure in the 5’ UTR of the pathogenic Trinidad strain occludes IFIT1 binding to viral RNA, whereas the IFIT1-sensitive TC-83 strain has a point mutation that destabilizes this RNA structure. This allows IFIT1 to bind viral RNA and inhibit viral infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>). VEEV TC83 can be inhibited by both human IFIT1 and mouse Ifit1B, suggesting similar mechanisms have been at least partially evolutionarily conserved to restrict viral infection by IFIT proteins. However, as viruses have evolved mechanisms to evade IFIT1 antiviral activity, IFIT1 may also experience evolutionary pressure to overcome viral evasion. We know little about how such virus-imposed constraints may have influenced <italic>IFIT1</italic> evolution across mammals, broadly.</p>
<p>Pathogenic viruses can cause severe disease or death in mammals, imposing a major selective pressure on their mammalian hosts to evolve mechanisms that restrict viral infection. In turn, there is pressure on viruses to evade host defenses. These “molecular arms races” of host-pathogen co-evolution are evident as many genes involved in antiviral immunity exhibit signatures of positive selection or rapid evolution. Computational evolutionary analyses of antiviral ISGs have revealed specific domains and residues that are rapidly evolving (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>). Identifying these signatures of positive selection has uncovered functional determinants of antiviral function in antiviral effectors such as MX1 and TRIM5α (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>). In addition to evolutionary pressure from host-pathogen molecular arms races, IFIT1 may have also been influenced by gene recombination occurring between <italic>IFIT1</italic> and the <italic>IFIT1B</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>). <italic>IFIT1</italic> genes have undergone duplication, gene loss, and recombination with <italic>IFIT1B</italic> in mammals, resulting in genes that exhibit differential antiviral activity However, this was only assessed in a few species, and the extent of differential antiviral activity of IFIT1 across Mammalia remains unknown. Recently, in a screen for antiviral ISGs from bats, we found that IFIT1 from the black flying fox displays particularly strong suppression of VEEV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>).</p>
<p>Together, these studies led us to hypothesize that evolution may have resulted in “species-specific” antiviral ability of IFIT1 orthologs. While previous studies have provided considerable insight into the antiviral mechanism and structure of some mammalian IFIT1 proteins, a comprehensive study into the antiviral specificity of IFIT1 orthologs remains lacking. Accordingly, we sought to use evolutionary and functional methods to interrogate differences in antiviral activity and biochemical properties of mammalian IFIT1.</p>

<title>IFIT1 is rapidly evolving in mammals</title>
<p>Many antiviral effectors exhibit signatures of positive selection, as restriction factors and the viruses they suppress are often engaged in “molecular arms races (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>).” Therefore, we hypothesized IFIT1 may be rapidly evolving, as IFIT1 is a potent antiviral effector that many viruses have evolved mechanisms to evade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>). To test this, we used established computational methods to determine if the <italic>IFIT1</italic> gene is rapidly evolving across diverse clades of mammals. Using <underline>P</underline>hylogenetic <underline>A</underline>nalysis using <underline>M</underline>aximum <underline>L</underline>ikelihood (PAML) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>), we determined that <italic>IFIT1</italic> exhibits signatures of rapid evolution in all clades tested (primates, bats, carnivores, and ungulates) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>). Rodents were not included in this analysis, as a genetic ortholog of IFIT1 has been lost in many rodent species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>). While all lineages showed signs of rapid evolution, carnivore IFIT1s exhibited the least significant likelihood of pervasive positive selection. However, all mammalian lineages were also determined to have at least 2 sites of statistically significant positive selection (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>). Detection of positive selection in certain domains or at specific sites of restriction factors has been utilized to uncover genetic determinants of antiviral function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>). Therefore, we sought to potentially uncover other sites in IFIT1 that may be engaged in host-pathogen conflicts using complementary methods to PAML. We next used <underline>F</underline>ast <underline>U</underline>nconstrained <underline>B</underline>ayesian <underline>A</underline>pp<underline>R</underline>oximation (FUBAR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>), another approach that had been used to identify rapidly evolving sites of restriction factors. Using FUBAR analysis, we further identified at least one site predicted to be undergoing significant rapid evolution for all clades except carnivores (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref>). Another complementary analysis, <underline>M</underline>ixed <underline>E</underline>ffects <underline>M</underline>odel of <underline>E</underline>volution (MEME) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>), identified several sites of positive selection for all linages of tested mammals (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1C</xref>). To our knowledge, these signatures of positive selection in <italic>IFIT1</italic> have not previously been reported and suggest that evolutionary pressure has acted on multiple regions of IFIT1.</p>

<title>Human IFIT1 residue 193 exhibits mutational resiliency</title>
<p>We next focused on three codons in primate IFIT1 – encoding V170, L193, and L366 in the human ortholog – that were determined by at least two models to be evolving under positive selection (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1D</xref>). We examined the location of each in solved IFIT1 structures for potential importance in RNA-binding. None of these residues had previously been reported to be involved in IFIT1 RNA-binding or antiviral function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>). While crystal structures of human IFIT1 bound to RNA indicate that residues V170 and L366 are not near the RNA-binding region, L193 is part of the TPR4 loop which has been reported to act as a lid over the 3’ exit of the RNA-binding tunnel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A, 2B</xref>). The TPR4 loop, located between α-helices 9 and 10, also has been suggested to play a role in mediating contacts between subdomain II and subdomain III (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>). Specifically, L193 in human IFIT1 protrudes into the exit of the RNA-binding tunnel and comes into close contact with RNA (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2C</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>). In addition, L193 is in close proximity to R187, which is required for IFIT1 RNA binding and antiviral function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>). Therefore, we sought to test the importance of L193 in the antiviral function of IFIT1. Our general strategy was to use CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing to silence endogenous IFIT1 in human cells, and then reconstitute expression by ectopic expression of IFIT1 193 mutants. We performed site-directed mutagenesis to generate point mutations in a CRISPR-resistant human IFIT1 clone that correspond to every possible amino acid at residue 193. Huh7.5 cells that were CRISPR-targeted for endogenous IFIT1 were transduced with lentiviral pseudoparticles to express each of the 193 mutant IFIT1s or appropriate controls. Cells expressing the IFIT1 point mutants were then challenged with VEEV encoding a GFP reporter, and infection was quantified by flow cytometry (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2D</xref>). We observed that most amino acid substitutions at residue 193 were tolerated by human IFIT1 with respect to antiviral function. In addition, western blotting determined that all IFIT1 point mutants were expressed to appreciable levels (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2D</xref>, Bottom). Indeed, all mutants at position 193, whether hydrophobic or positively charged, inhibited VEEV similarly to the wild-type (193L) IFIT1 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2D</xref>). Polar amino acids introduced at position 193 also retained antiviral function (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2D</xref>). Severe loss of function in anti-VEEV activity of IFIT1 was only notable with glycine or proline (~50% loss of antiviral function) or with negatively charged residues (~75-100% loss of antiviral function) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2D</xref>). This experiment demonstrated the resiliency of IFIT1 antiviral function despite introduction of mutations in rapidly evolving site 193 within the TPR4 loop.</p>

<title>IFIT1 orthologs from diverse mammals demonstrate species-specific antiviral activity</title>
<p>To better understand the consequences of the evolutionary pressures on IFIT1, we sought to test the antiviral activity of diverse mammalian IFIT1 orthologs against RNA viruses. To accomplish this, we cloned IFIT1 protein-coding sequences from 38 species (including 2 predicted IFIT1 sequences from horse) of mammals into lentiviral expression vectors. The chosen orthologs ranged from 60% to over 98% identical to human IFIT1 in protein coding sequence and encompassed 11 taxonomic orders (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3A, Fig 3B</xref>, Supp Table 1) within the superorders Euarchontoglires, Laurasiatheria, Afrotheria, and Xenartha, thus representing extensive diversity in both sequence and evolutionary distance relative to human IFIT1. All IFIT1 orthologs were also N-terminally HA-tagged to allow for detection by western blot. After generating lentivirus pseudoparticles, we transduced human Huh7.5 cells with these 39 IFIT1 orthologs or appropriate controls and challenged IFIT1-expressing cells with two different RNA viruses encoding a GFP reporter, VEEV and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV). These viruses were chosen because of reported suppression by human IFIT1 through distinct mechanisms. VSV is a rhabdovirus with a negative sense single-stranded RNA genome. IFIT1 inhibits VSV by binding to viral RNA ending in a triphosphate (5’-ppp-N), sequestering viral RNA from the replicating RNA pool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>). VEEV (TC-83 strain) is an alphavirus with a positive-sense single-stranded RNA genome and is restricted by IFIT1 due to the binding and translation inhibition of viral Cap0 RNA (m7G-ppp-N). This viral RNA possesses the canonical m7G cap but lacks 2’O methylation of the initialing nucleotide of the viral 5’ UTR, allowing recognition and binding by human IFIT1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>). IFIT1-expressing cells were challenged with an MOI of 1 for both VSV-GFP and VEEV-GFP, and infection was quantified by flow cytometry (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3C</xref>). IFIT1 orthologs capable of potently restricting VSV or VEEV infection, defined by inhibition of 70% or greater relative to control cells, were considered hits in this screen. VEEV infection was potently suppressed by eleven IFIT1 orthologs (African savannah elephant, Chinese pangolin, sheep, white-tailed deer, black flying fox, dromedary camel, orca, Angola colobus, big brown bat, human, and large flying fox) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3C</xref>). Five IFIT1 orthologs (orca, cape elephant shrew, dolphin, European rabbit, and nine-banded armadillo) inhibited VSV infection by at least 70% compared to control cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3D</xref>). We were surprised that hits for each virus spanned such diverse mammalian clades, and that there was little overlap in orthologs that inhibit VEEV and VSV. Also unexpected, many IFIT1 orthologs exhibited no antiviral activity against these two viruses, as only 10 of the 39 tested orthologs met our threshold to be considered hits. Western blotting determined that IFIT1 expression was not uniform during the ortholog screen (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Supp Fig 1</xref>), suggesting that low expression of certain orthologs may have contributed to lack of antiviral function. Expression of certain IFIT1 orthologs (e.g. orca and European rabbit) was much higher than others, and some IFIT1 orthologs were expressed at very low levels (e.g. African green monkey and greater horseshoe bat) (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Supp Fig 1</xref>). In addition, black-capped squirrel monkey IFIT1 was observed to run at a lower-than-expected molecular weight, suggesting a truncation or cleavage of the protein product (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Supp Fig 1</xref>). However, it was noted that many IFIT1 orthologs were hits in the screens despite low expression, and only orca IFIT1 was a hit in both VSV and VEEV screens despite very high expression by multiple orthologs. These data suggest that IFIT1 orthologs may exhibit species-specific antiviral functions independent of differences in protein expression.</p>

<p>Since expression of IFIT1 from distinct species was not equal during the ortholog screen, we sought to validate the antiviral phenotypes of a subset of orthologs with more comparable expression. We selected 9 orthologs for follow-up based on protein expression, evolutionary diversity, and variable phenotypes exhibited in the ortholog screen. Those chosen for validation and follow-up included IFIT1 from Chinese pangolin (hereafter referred to as pangolin), orca, sheep, black flying fox, big brown bat, chinchilla, human, chimpanzee, and cape elephant shrew (hereafter referred to as shrew) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4A</xref>). Human Huh7.5 cells were transduced with differing doses of lentivirus pseudoparticles to normalize IFIT1 expression between this subset of orthologs. After puromycin selection, western blot analysis revealed that the expression of IFIT1 orthologs was relatively uniform, except for the higher expression of orca IFIT1 and notably lower expression of pangolin IFIT1 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4B</xref>). IFIT1-expressing cells were then challenged with VEEV (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4C</xref>) and VSV (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4D</xref>) at an MOI of 2 to validate results from the original IFIT1 ortholog overexpression screen. VSV was potently inhibited by orca and shrew IFIT1, while no other tested orthologs significantly suppressed infection. Thus, VSV may evade suppression by many mammalian IFIT1s. VEEV was potently inhibited by pangolin, sheep, black flying fox, big brown bat, and human IFIT1, while orca IFIT1 modestly inhibited VEEV. Strikingly, VEEV was not significantly inhibited by chimpanzee IFIT1 but was largely suppressed by human IFIT1. This was of keen interest as human and chimpanzee IFIT1 differ in protein sequence by only 8 amino acids, and one of these (residue 366) was identified as rapidly evolving by both FUBAR and MEME (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1D</xref>). Together, these validation experiments demonstrate that mammalian IFIT1 species-specific differences in viral suppression are largely independent of expression differences. This is exemplified by potent restriction of VEEV by pangolin and big brown bat IFIT1 despite low expression (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4B</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4C</xref>). Furthermore, high-expressing sheep IFIT1 only restricted VEEV infection, but not VSV, and orca IFIT1 only modestly reduced VEEV infection despite much higher expression than all other IFIT1s (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4B-D</xref>).</p>

<p>We further tested the ability of this subset of 9 IFIT1 orthologs to inhibit human parainfluenza virus type 3 (PIV3) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4E</xref>). PIV3 is a paramyxovirus with a negative sense, single-stranded RNA (−ssRNA) genome that is not previously reported to be inhibited by IFIT1. However, PIV3 was chosen for follow-up because human IFIT1 is a dominant antiviral effector towards the related human parainfluenza virus type 5 (PIV5) acting through an unknown mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>). PIV3 was significantly restricted by shrew, pangolin, chinchilla, black flying fox, and big brown bat IFIT1 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4E</xref>). This was notable as human IFIT1 exhibited no antiviral activity towards PIV3, whereas it is a key component of IFN-mediated restriction of the related PIV5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>). Chinchilla IFIT1 also exhibited disparate activities, as it did not inhibit VEEV (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4C</xref>) or VSV (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4D</xref>), yet significantly protected cells from PIV3 infection (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4E</xref>). We then tested cells expressing the 9 selected IFIT1 orthologs for the ability to suppress another alphavirus related to VEEV, Sindbis virus (SINV) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4E</xref>). SINV was largely resistant to most mammalian IFIT1s, consistent with previous human IFIT1 studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>). However, SINV was potently suppressed by orca IFIT1, and modestly suppressed by pangolin, sheep, and chinchilla IFIT1 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4E</xref>), highlighting a pattern of suppression that was distinct across the 9 orthologs relative to the alphavirus VEEV. Together, these data demonstrate that IFIT1 orthologs exhibit broad antiviral phenotypes towards a panel of viruses with both +ssRNA and −ssRNA genomes (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4G</xref>), largely independent of differences in protein expression.</p>

<title>Human, black flying fox, and chimpanzee IFIT1 protein exhibit species-specific RNA binding</title>
<p>As previously highlighted, human and black flying fox IFIT1 significantly protected cells from VEEV infection compared to a control, while chimpanzee IFIT1 did not (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4C</xref>). The black flying fox (<italic>Pteropus alecto</italic>), is a model megabat species that is a reservoir for zoonotic viruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>) and expresses restriction factors with unique antiviral activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>). While human and black flying fox IFIT1 share only 69% identity, human and chimpanzee IFIT1 are over 98% identical (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3B</xref>, Supp Table 1). Therefore, IFIT1 from these three species were of particular interest for functional studies. Accordingly, we sought to determine if this variability in restricting VEEV was due to differences in Cap0 RNA-binding ability of IFIT1 orthologs.</p>
<p>To perform <italic>in vitro</italic> RNA-binding assays, recombinant IFIT1 proteins were generated (<xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Supp Fig 2</xref>). We then performed an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) to investigate the RNA-binding properties of three mammalian IFIT1 orthologs. RNA probes matching the first 41 nucleotides of the VEEV 5’ UTR were generated for EMSA by <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription. Probes were capped by the faustovirus capping enzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>) to generate 5’ ends that resemble physiological Cap0 VEEV RNAs. After incubation of IFIT1 protein with Cap0 RNA probes, protein:RNA complexes were run on native gels, which were stained with a nucleic acid dye to visualize band shifts (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5A</xref>). Quantification of band shift intensity and area under the curve analysis revealed that black flying fox IFIT1 exhibited the strongest RNA binding activity (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5B, 5C</xref>). Human IFIT1 also bound VEEV RNA, but to a lesser extent than black flying fox IFIT1. Little binding was observed by chimpanzee IFIT1, as band shift intensity was barely above that of a human RNA-binding deficient control (human IFIT1-R187H) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5B, 5C</xref>). These biochemical data are consistent with viral phenotypes (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4C</xref>), suggesting that species-specific antiviral activities of IFIT1s can be partly explained by RNA binding potential.</p>

<title>Mutagenesis of primate IFIT1 reveals genetic determinants of IFIT1 antiviral function</title>
<p>While human IFIT1 exhibited potent VEEV restriction and significant VEEV Cap0 RNA binding, chimpanzee IFIT1 lacked these properties. Chimpanzee and human IFIT1 differ by only 8 amino acids (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6A</xref>), prompting us to examine which residues underlie the phenotypic differences. We performed site-directed mutagenesis to generate point mutations in both human and chimpanzee IFIT1 that correspond to the divergent residues between the two proteins (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6A</xref>). As 3 of the 8 residues, 362, 364, and 366, are in close proximity (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6A</xref>), we also generated a triple mutant IFIT1 that has these residues swapped between chimpanzee and human IFIT1 (hereafter referred to as the 362/4/6 triple mut). Notably, one of these three sites, L366 in humans and M366 in chimpanzee, was determined to be rapidly evolving in 2 of the tested computational models (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1D</xref>).</p>

<p>We transduced Huh7.5 cells with lentiviruses expressing wild type (WT), single point mutant IFIT1s, or 362/4/6 triple mut IFIT1. After selection of transduced cells with puromycin, stable cells were challenged with VEEV-GFP at an MOI of 2 and infectivity was quantified by flow cytometry (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6B</xref>). Western blotting demonstrated near uniform expression of all human and chimpanzee IFIT1 mutants (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6B</xref>). Cells expressing wild-type chimpanzee IFIT1 were infected by VEEV at a rate of about 50%, similar to the approximately 60% infection rate observed in control cells. WT human IFIT1-expressing cells were infected at a rate of less than 10%, demonstrating significant VEEV suppression. Interestingly, the only point mutation in human IFIT1 that resulted in a significant loss of antiviral activity was L366M. Cells expressing human IFIT1 with the L366M point mutant were infected at a rate roughly 4-fold higher than cells expressing WT human IFIT1 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6B</xref>). Introduction of a Q364R mutation in human IFIT1 also resulted in a partial loss of antiviral function, although this was not statistically significant. Furthermore, the 362/4/6 triple mut introduced into human IFIT1 resulted in a near complete loss of anti-VEEV function of human IFIT1(<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6B</xref>). The reciprocal was true for chimpanzee IFIT1, which significantly gained antiviral function when the M366L mutation was introduced. Cells expressing chimpanzee IFIT1 M366L were roughly half as likely to be infected as cells expressing the WT chimpanzee IFIT1 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6B</xref>). In addition, R364Q mutant chimpanzee IFIT1 resulted in a moderate increase in antiviral activity; however, this was not statistically significant compared to wild-type chimpanzee IFIT1. Furthermore, the 362/4/6 triple mut chimpanzee IFIT1 potently suppressed VEEV infection at a nearly identical level to that of WT human IFIT1. Together, we show that residues N362, Q364, and L366 in human IFIT1 are necessary for viral suppression of VEEV. In addition, the mutations of S362N, R364Q, and M366L in combination are sufficient for chimpanzee IFIT1 to gain potent antiviral function.</p>
<p>Amino acids 362, 364, and 366 are generally conserved across IFIT1 from 20 different primate species (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6C</xref>). Specifically, residue 366 is typically a hydrophobic amino acid, with 5 out of the 20 primate sequences analyzed having either a valine or methionine, as seen in chimpanzee IFIT1, instead of a leucine, which is present in human IFIT1 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6C</xref>). This suggests that leucine at position 366 might be important for robust antiviral function in primate IFIT1, although further experiments are necessary to confirm this role. Additional support for the importance of L366 comes from our findings that the only primate IFIT1, besides those of chimpanzees and humans, which was expressed at appreciable levels during the screen was that of the Angola colobus. This IFIT1 variant also potently inhibited VEEV infection and notably contains a leucine at residue 366, similar to human IFIT1 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3C</xref>, <xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Supp Fig 1</xref>). Glutamine is conserved at site 364 in all primate species aligned except chimpanzee which encodes an arginine (Q364R), introducing a positive charge. Point mutants of residue 364 in chimpanzee and human IFIT1 exhibited moderate alterations in anti-VEEV function, though not statistically significant, suggesting that this amino acid may have a minor role in antiviral restriction that synergizes with L366.</p>
<p>To test if residues 364 and 366 synergize to confer antiviral specificity between human and chimpanzee IFIT1, 364 and 366 double mutants (referred to as 364/6 double mut) were generated for both chimpanzee and human IFIT1. Huh7.5 cells expressing to express wild-type (WT), 364/6 double mut, or 362/4/6 triple mut IFIT1s of both chimpanzee and human IFIT1 were then challenged with VEEV-GFP at an MOI of 2 and infection was quantified by flow cytometry (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6D</xref>). Western blotting demonstrated uniform expression of all human and chimpanzee IFIT1 mutants (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6D</xref>). As in previous experiments, wild-type human IFIT1 strongly suppressed VEEV infection while wild-type chimpanzee IFIT1 did not (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6D</xref>). However, the 364/6 double mut and 362/4/6 triple mut of human IFIT1 both had a near complete loss of antiviral capacity, resulting in cells being infected at a similar rate as cells expressing the wild-type chimpanzee IFIT1 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6D</xref>). These results suggest that residues 364 and 366, but not residue 362, in human IFIT1 are necessary to confer anti-VEEV function. In contrast, cells expressing the 364/6 double mutant or the 362/4/6 triple mutant of chimpanzee IFIT1 potently suppressed VEEV infection at rates similar to those observed in cells expressing wild-type human IFIT1. No difference in antiviral potency was observed between chimpanzee IFIT1 with the 364/6 double mut or 362/4/6 triple mut, suggesting again that residue 362 does not play a key role in the differential antiviral properties of human and chimpanzee IFIT1. Together, these data indicate that out of 8 amino acids that differ between human and chimpanzee IFIT1, sites 364 and 366, in combination, comprise the underlying differences in anti-VEEV function.</p>
<p>We next examined the location of amino acids 364 and 366 in the solved crystal structure of human IFIT1 bound to RNA and in the chimpanzee IFIT1 structure predicted by AlphaFold. Residues 364 and 366 are located within the α-helix 18 within TPR7 of IFIT1 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6A, 6E</xref>). They are not predicted to contact RNA and are not located in direct proximity of the RNA-binding pocket (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6E, 6F</xref>), suggesting they may regulate IFIT1 function in an allosteric manner.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Here, combining evolutionary and functional data, we conclude that mammalian IFIT1s are rapidly evolving viral restriction factors that exhibit species-specific antiviral activity. Furthermore, differences between the ability of human and chimpanzee IFIT1 to restrict VEEV led to the unexpected discovery that 2 residues in α-helices 18 within the TPR7 domain of IFIT1 may partially determine primate IFIT1 antiviral capacity. Swapping amino acids 364 and 366 of the IFIT1 protein sequence between human and chimpanzee IFIT1, in combination, resulted in reciprocal antiviral phenotypes (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6B, 6D</xref>). The structures of human and chimp IFIT1 suggest that these amino acids are not directly involved in RNA binding. Thus, they may be involved in conformational changes of IFIT1 during RNA-binding or other allosteric effects, though additional studies are needed to test this.</p>
<p>Our data also support a hypothesis in which the breadth of IFIT1 antiviral phenotypes may be, at least partially, explained by differences in RNA-binding ability. VEEV infection was most potently suppressed by black flying fox IFIT1, significantly inhibited by human IFIT1, and unaffected by chimpanzee IFIT1 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4C</xref>). This trend was similarly observed in RNA binding assays with a sequence identical to that of the Cap0 VEEV 5’ UTR by EMSA (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5</xref>). Black flying fox IFIT1 exhibited the strongest binding of VEEV Cap0 RNA, pronounced binding was observed by human IFIT1, with minimal VEEV Cap0 RNA binding by chimpanzee IFIT1 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5</xref>). These data are consistent with previous studies showing that the ability of IFIT1 to bind viral RNA is required for its antiviral function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>).</p>
<p>The differential antiviral activity between IFIT1B and IFIT1 across several mammals was previously demonstrated by Daugherty et al.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>). This study used phylogenetic approaches to show that gene birth, gene loss and gene conversion occurred throughout vertebrate <italic>IFIT</italic> genes, resulting in extensive genetic diversity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>). Furthermore, through viral infection assays and a yeast growth assay, the authors suggest different RNA-binding properties and disparate antiviral functions between primate IFIT1s and mouse Ifit1b (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>). Our studies significantly expand the diversity of mammalian IFIT1s interrogated for antiviral function. Notably, based on our studies, IFIT1s across <italic>Mammalia</italic> are not universally antiviral against VEEV and VSV. In fact, antiviral specificity of IFIT1 orthologs is possibly quite narrow and highly dependent on which virus is being evaluated.</p>
<p>We additionally provide new data to support a model in which mammalian IFIT1s spanning diverse orders are rapidly evolving, and that in primates, this is occurring at functionally relevant sites that are not directly implicated in RNA binding. Our computational studies also identified amino acid 193 as rapidly evolving and a mutational scanning determined that this residue is mutationally resilient. This was similarly observed for TRIM5α, in which most mutations within the v1 loop did not affect antiviral potency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>). In addition, alteration of charge within the v1 loop of TRIM5α played a significant role in determining the antiviral outcome of TRIM5α mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>). We similarly observed that introduction of negatively charged residues at position 193 within the TPR4 loop of human IFIT1 ablated antiviral activity (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2D</xref>). Therefore, mutational resiliency within a rapidly evolving residue of primate IFIT1 suggests that alteration of a single amino acid within restriction factor IFIT1 may not result in major gain or loss antiviral function. This may maximize the potential for adaptation during evolutionary arms races with viruses. However, we cannot rule out the potential major role of mutations at position 193 in combination with other mutations in IFIT1. Together, our data suggest that positions 193 is rapidly evolving in primates and may accommodate many different amino acids while retaining antiviral function.</p>
<p>Our study does have several limitations, however. All IFIT1 ortholog screens were performed by expressing IFIT1 from distinct species in human cells, which may potentially affect natural antiviral function. For example, some IFIT1 orthologs may bind viral RNA, but not interface with human proteins to effectively suppress translation, resulting in no antiviral activity when expressed in human cells. Furthermore, our biochemical assays focus on IFIT1 binding to Cap0 RNA only. This is due to comparative studies that have demonstrated IFIT1 has the strongest affinity for Cap0 RNA when compared to other RNAs, such as ppp-RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>). This allowed us to use human IFIT1 as a positive control for Cap0 RNA-binding with a strong signal-to-noise for comparative RNA binding assays between IFIT1 orthologs that were successfully purified. However, it is possible that differences in ppp-RNA binding may underlie differences in the antiviral potency of IFIT1 towards viruses such as VSV and PIV3. This study also does not address the possibility that differential viral evasion of IFIT1 proteins contributes to species-specific antiviral activity. Furthermore, we have only provided genetic, but not biochemical or structural evidence for underlying differences in chimpanzee and human IFIT1 RNA-binding and antiviral activity. By mutagenesis assays we demonstrate that 2 amino acid changes confer antiviral activity between chimpanzee and human IFIT1. Additional insight into the role of these residues might be gained from molecular dynamics simulations using the crystal structure of human IFIT1 bound to Cap0 RNA as a template. Comparisons with the 364/366 double mutant might determine whether these substitutions alter conformational dynamics in a manner that disfavors RNA binding.</p>
<p>Summarily, our findings underscore the notion that unbiased screening, investigations of restriction factors from non-model mammalian species, and evolutionary-guided approaches may uncover novel findings in host-pathogen interactions.</p>

Transfection complexes were then added to 293T cells in 1mL of DMEM supplemented with 3% FBS dropwise. After 6 h of incubation, media was changed to 1.5 mL of DMEM supplemented with 3% FBS. Supernatants containing lentiviral pseudoparticles were harvested at 48 and 72 h post-transfection. Lentiviral pseudoparticles were then processed by adding 4µg/mL Polybrene (Sigma), 20mM HEPES, centrifuging at 1500rpm for 5min to remove cell debris, and storing at −80°C until transductions.</p>
<p>Lentivirus transductions were performed in 6-well plates after plating 350,000 cells (Huh7.5). Final volume of transductions was either 1mL or 1.5mL of lentivirus mixed with “pseudoparticle” DMEM (DMEM supplemented with 3% FBS, 4µg/mL Polybrene, and 20mM HEPES) After a 6 h incubation at 37°C, 2mL of complete DMEM was added to all transductions. Transduced cells were split into selection media 48h post-transduction and passaged for a minimum of three passages in selection media.</p>

<title>Protein Purification</title>
<p>IFIT1 protein coding sequences that were codon-optimized for bacterial expression were cloned into a modified pET28a bacterial expression vector, containing an N-terminal 6X-His tag followed by the yeast Sumo (smt3). Plasmids were transformed into Rosetta DE3 cells. Transformants were grown in Terrific Broth (TB) with 50 mg/L Kanamycin and 34 mg/L of Chloramphenicol and Antifoam B at 37 °C. At the OD<sub>600</sub> of 0.4, the temperature was lowered to 18 °C. Protein expression was induced at OD<sub>600</sub>=3 by addition of IPTG to 0.4 mM final concentration. Cells were harvested after an overnight incubation by centrifugation (OD<sub>600</sub>=~8.5) and lysed in the lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8, 500 mM NaCl, 15 mM Imidazole, 1 mM PMSF, 4 mM β-ME) by sonication. Cell lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 35,000 x g for 30 minutes. The cleared lysate was applied onto a gravity column with pre-washed Ni-NTA resin. Resin was washed with 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8, 1 M NaCl, 30 mM Imidazole, 4 mM β-ME. Proteins were eluted with 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8, 300 mM NaCl, 300 mM Imidazole, 2 mM DTT. Proteins were treated with Ulp1 protease overnight to remove the Sumo tag and passed over a size-exclusion column (HiLoad 16/600 Superdex 200 pg), equilibrated with 50 mM Tris 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT. Peak fractions were pooled, concentrated by ultrafiltration, and stored at −80 °C until use. For SDS-PAGE gels of purified IFIT1 protein, 500nM of human, black flying fox, chimpanzee, and human R187H mutant IFIT1 were boiled in 4X Laemmli Sample Buffer (BioRad) with 1.25% BME and loaded into a 4-20% Mini-PROTEAN® TGX™ Precast Protein Gel (BioRad). Gels were run and subsequently incubated in Coomassie stain (40% ethanol, 10% glacial acetic acid, 0.1% Coomassie R-250) for 1 hour and destained overnight (10% ethanol, 7.5% glacial acetic acid). Gels were imaged with the ChemiDoc Imaging System (BioRad).</p>

<title>RNA Electrophoretic mobility shift assay</title>
<p>Protein stock concentration of IFIT1 orthologs was determined by diluting protein 1:5 in 1x TBE and measuring A280. Extinction coefficient was determined by ProtParam tool (Expasy), and subsequently used to calculate and normalize protein concentrations between stocks.</p>
<p>Before loading, native gels (10% 19:1 Acrylamide: Bis-acrylamide, 25mM NaCl, 1x TBE, 0.0005% APS, 0.001% TEMED) were pre-run with 1x TBE in a cold room for at least 2.5 h. While gels were pre-running, binding reactions were set up at room temperature after thawing and keeping both RNA and protein stocks on ice. All dilutions of protein and RNA were in 1x reaction buffer (50nM TRIS pH 8.0, 100mM NaCl, 1mM EDTA, 0.01mg/mL Heparin sodium sulfate, 2.5% Glycerol). For binding reactions, 50nM of Cap0 RNA was mixed 1:1 with 0, 80, 160, 240, 320, and 400nM of purified IFIT1 protein in a final volume of 20µL and incubated at room temperature for 20 min.</p>
<p>18 µL of RNA:Protein complexes were then run on pre-run native gels for 2.5 h at 100V in 1x TBE in a cold room. Gels were then stained with 1x SYBR Gold stain (ThermoFisher Scientific) diluted in 1x TBE for 20 min rocking at room temperature and imaged on a ChemiDoc Imaging System (BioRad) with UV transillumination. Band intensity was subsequently analyzed using ImageLab software (BioRad).</p>

<title>In vitro transcription and 5’ capping of RNA probes</title>
<p>Uncapped RNA probes were generated using the T7 RiboMAX™ Express Large Scale RNA Production System (Promega). Manufacturer instructions were modified for generating short RNA probes. Briefly, 10µM of DNA oligos corresponding to the T7φ2.5 promoter sequence and the complementary T7φ2.5 promoter sequence followed by the first 41nt of the VEEV TC-83 strain 5’ UTR sequence. Oligos were boiled at 95°C for 2-3 min and then slow cooled to room temperature to allow annealing. 1 µM of the annealed DNA oligos served as the template per 20µL T7 transcription reaction. RNA was purified according to manufacturer instructions using phenol:chloroform nucleic acid extraction (Promega).</p>
<p>To generate Cap0 RNA, purified uncapped RNA probes were modified using the Faustovirus Capping Enzyme (FCE) (NEB) using modified manufacturer instructions. Briefly, 100µL reactions were composed of 20µL of uncapped RNA purified after T7 transcription (described above), 0.2mM SAM, 1mM GTP, 7500U of FCE, 1x FCE reaction buffer, 80U RNasin® Plus Ribonuclease Inhibitor (Promega), and nuclease-free water up to 100µL. Reactions were incubated at 42°C for 4.5 h and then another 0.5 h at 50°C. Cap0 RNA was then purified using the same phenol:chloroform nucleic acid extraction as performed after the T7 transcription reaction (Promega). Cap0 RNA was determined to be at least 95% Cap0 RNA (m7GpppA) by targeted LC/MS after Nuclease P1 (NEB) digestion at 37°C for 30 min followed by inactivation of enzyme at 95°C for 2 min. LC/MS was performed by the UT Southwestern Preclinical Pharmacology Core Facility.</p>

To perform PAML analysis, we used default settings with the F3x4 codon frequency table within CodeML. Likelihood ratio tests were performed to compare model 7 versus model 8 and model 8 versus model 8a to determine the presence of positive selection. Bayes empirical Bayes testing was performed to determine specific residues that are adaptively evolving. Species trees were generated using the TimeTree database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>). FigTree software was then used to make trees shown in figures. Alignments and determination of amino acid identity to human IFIT1 was performed using ClustalOmega (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>).

<p>This <bold>valuable</bold> report describes the changing antiviral activity of IFIT1 across mammals and in response to distinct viruses, likely as a result of past arms races. One of the main strengths of the manuscript is the breadth of mammalian IFIT1 orthologs and viruses that were tested. Overall the evidence is <bold>solid</bold>, but the analysis of positive selection could benefit from more thorough validation with complementary selection tests and also from assessing or more extended discussion of the impact of recombination and/or physical interactions with other IFITs.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>McDougal et al. aimed to characterize the antiviral activity of mammalian IFIT1 orthologs. They first performed three different evolutionary selection analyses within each major mammalian clade and identified some overlapping positive selection sites in IFIT1. They found that one site that is positively selected in primates is in the RNA-binding exit tunnel of IFIT1 and is tolerant of mutations to amino acids with similar biochemical properties. They then tested 9 diverse mammalian IFIT1 proteins against VEEV, VSV, PIV3, and SINV and found that each ortholog has distinct antiviral activities. Lastly, they compared human and chimpanzee IFIT1 and found that the determinant of their differential anti-VEEV activity may be partly attributed to their ability to bind Cap0 RNA.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The study is one of the first to test the antiviral activity of IFIT1 from diverse mammalian clades against VEEV, VSV, PIV3, and SINV. Cloning and expressing these 39 IFIT1 orthologs in addition to single and combinatorial mutants is not a trivial task. The positive connection between anti-VEEV activity and Cap0 RNA binding is interesting, suggesting that differences in RNA binding may explain differences in antiviral activity.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The evolutionary selection analyses yielded interesting results, but were not used to inform follow-up studies except for a positively selected site identified in primates. Since positive selection is one of the two major angles the authors proposed to investigate mammalian IFIT1 orthologs with, they should integrate the positive selection results with the rest of the paper more seamlessly, such as discussing the positive selection results and their implications, rather than just pointing out that positively selected sites were identified. The paper should elaborate on how the positive selection analyses PAML, FUBAR, and MEME complement one another to explain why the tests gave them different results. Interestingly, MEME which usually provides more sites did not identify site 193 in primates that was identified by both PAML and FUBAR. The authors should also provide the rationale for choosing to focus on the 3 sites identified in primates only. One of those sites, 193, was also found to be positively selected in bats, although the authors did not discuss or integrate that finding into the study. In Figure 1A, they also showed a dN/dS &lt; 1 from PAML, which is confusing and would suggest negative selection instead of positive selection. Importantly, since the authors focused on the rapidly evolving site 193 in primates, they should test the IFIT1 orthologs against viruses that are known to infect primates to directly investigate the impact of the evolutionary arms race at this site on IFIT1 function.</p>
<p>Some of the data interpretation is not accurate. For example:</p>
<p>(1) Lines 232-234: &quot;...western blot analysis revealed that the expression of IFIT1 orthologs was relatively uniform, except for the higher expression of orca IFIT1 and notably lower expression of pangolin IFIT1 (Figure 4B).&quot; In fact, most of the orthologs are not expressed in a &quot;relatively uniform&quot; manner e.g. big brown bat vs. shrew are quite different.</p>
<p>(2) Line 245: &quot;...mammalian IFIT1 species-specific differences in viral suppression are largely independent of expression differences.&quot; While it is true that there is no correlation between protein expression and antiviral activity in each species, the authors cannot definitively conclude that the species-specific differences are independent of expression differences. Since the orthologs are clearly not expressed in the same amounts, it is impossible to fully assess their true antiviral activity. At the very least, the authors should acknowledge that the protein expression can affect antiviral activity. They should also consider quantifying the IFIT1 protein bands and normalizing each to GAPDH for readers to better compare protein expression and antiviral activity. The same issue is in Line 267.</p>
<p>(3) Line 263: &quot;SINV... was modestly suppressed by pangolin, sheep, and chinchilla IFIT1 (Figure 4E)...&quot; The term &quot;modestly suppressed&quot; does not seem fitting if there is 60-70% infection in cells expressing pangolin and chinchilla IFIT1.</p>
<p>(4) The study can be significantly improved if the authors can find a thread to connect each piece of data together, so the readers can form a cohesive story about mammalian IFIT1.</p>

<p>McDougal et al. describe the surprising finding that IFIT1 proteins from different mammalian species inhibit the replication of different viruses, indicating that the evolution of IFIT1 across mammals has resulted in host species-specific antiviral specificity. Before this work, research into the antiviral activity and specificity of IFIT1 had mostly focused on the human ortholog, which was described to inhibit viruses including vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) and Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV) but not other viruses including Sindbis virus (SINV) and parainfluenza virus type 3 (PIV3). In the current work, the authors first perform evolutionary analyses on IFIT1 genes across a wide range of mammalian species and reveal that IFIT1 genes have evolved under positive selection in primates, bats, carnivores, and ungulates. Based on these data, they hypothesize that IFIT1 proteins from these diverse mammalian groups may show distinct antiviral specificities against a panel of viruses. By generating human cells that express IFIT1 proteins from different mammalian species, the authors show a wide range of antiviral activities of mammalian IFIT1s. Most strikingly, they find several IFIT1 proteins that have completely different antiviral specificities relative to human IFIT1, including IFIT1s that fail to inhibit VSV or VEEV, but strongly inhibit PIV3 or SINV. These results indicate that there is potential for IFIT1 to inhibit a much wider range of viruses than human IFIT1 inhibits. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) suggest that some of these changes in antiviral specificity can be ascribed to changes in the direct binding of viral RNAs. Interestingly, they also find that chimpanzee IFIT1, which is &gt;98% identical to human IFIT1, fails to inhibit any tested virus. Replacing three residues from chimpanzee IFIT1 with those from human IFIT1, one of which has evolved under positive selection in primates, restores activity to chimpanzee IFIT1. Together, these data reveal a vast diversity of IFIT1 antiviral specificity encoded by mammals, consistent with an IFIT1-virus evolutionary &quot;arms race&quot;.</p>
<p>Overall, this is a very interesting and well-written manuscript that combines evolutionary and functional approaches to provide new insight into IFIT1 antiviral activity and species-specific antiviral immunity. The conclusion that IFIT1 genes in several mammalian lineages are evolving under positive selection is supported by the data, although there are some important analyses that need to be done to remove any confounding effects from gene recombination that has previously been described between IFIT1 and its paralog IFIT1B. The virology results, which convincingly show that IFIT1s from different species have distinct antiviral specificity, are the most surprising and exciting part of the paper. As such, this paper will be interesting for researchers studying mechanisms of innate antiviral immunity, as well as those interested in species-specific antiviral immunity. Moreover, it may prompt others to test a wide range of orthologs of antiviral factors beyond those from humans or mice, which could further the concept of host-specific innate antiviral specificity. Additional areas for improvement, which are mostly to clarify the presentation of data and conclusions, are described below.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) This paper is a very strong demonstration of the concept that orthologous innate immune proteins can evolve distinct antiviral specificities. Specifically, the authors show that IFIT1 proteins from different mammalian species are able to inhibit the replication of distinct groups of viruses, which is most clearly illustrated in Figure 4G. This is an unexpected finding, as the mechanism by which IFIT1 inhibits viral replication was assumed to be similar across orthologs. While the molecular basis for these differences remains unresolved, this is a clear indication that IFIT1 evolution functionally impacts host-specific antiviral immunity and that IFIT1 has the potential to inhibit a much wider range of viruses than previously described.</p>
<p>(2) By revealing these differences in antiviral specificity across IFIT1 orthologs, the authors highlight the importance of sampling antiviral proteins from different mammalian species to understand what functions are conserved and what functions are lineage- or species-specific. These results might therefore prompt similar investigations with other antiviral proteins, which could reveal a previously undiscovered diversity of specificities for other antiviral immunity proteins.</p>
<p>(3) The authors also surprisingly reveal that chimpanzee IFIT1 shows no antiviral activity against any tested virus despite only differing from human IFIT1 by eight amino acids. By mapping this loss of function to three residues on one helix of the protein, the authors shed new light on a region of the protein with no previously known function.</p>
<p>(4) Combined with evolutionary analyses that indicate that IFIT1 genes are evolving under positive selection in several mammalian groups, these functional data indicate that IFIT1 is engaged in an evolutionary &quot;arms race&quot; with viruses, which results in distinct antiviral specificities of IFIT1 proteins from different species.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) The evolutionary analyses the authors perform appear to indicate that IFIT1 genes in several mammalian groups have evolved under positive selection. However, IFIT1 has previously been shown to have undergone recurrent instances of recombination with the paralogous IFIT1B, which can confound positive selection analyses such as the ones the authors perform. The authors should analyze their alignments for evidence of recombination using a tool such as GARD (in the same HyPhy package along with MEME and FUBAR). Detection of recombination in these alignments would invalidate their positive selection inferences, in which case the authors need to either analyze individual non-recombining domains or limit the number of species to those that are not undergoing recombination. While it is likely that these analyses will still reveal a signature of positive selection, this step is necessary to ensure that the signatures of selection and sites of positive selection are accurate.</p>
<p>(2) The choice of IFIT1 homologs chosen for study needs to be described in more detail. Many mammalian species encode IFIT1 and IFIT1B proteins, which have been shown to have different antiviral specificity, and the evolutionary relationship between IFIT1 and IFIT1B paralogs is complicated by recombination. As such, the assertion that the proteins studied in this manuscript are IFIT1 orthologs requires additional support than the percent identity plot shown in Figure 3B.</p>
<p>(3) Some of the results and discussion text could be more focused on the model of evolution-driven changes in IFIT1 specificity. In particular, the chimpanzee data are interesting, but it would appear that this protein has lost all antiviral function, rather than changing its antiviral specificity like some other examples in this paper. As such, the connection between the functional mapping of individual residues with the positive selection analysis is somewhat confusing. It would be more clear to discuss this as a natural loss of function of this IFIT1, which has occurred elsewhere repeatedly across the mammalian tree.</p>
<p>(4) In other places in the manuscript, the strength of the differences in antiviral specificity could be highlighted to a greater degree. Specifically, the text describes a number of interesting examples of differences in inhibition of VSV versus VEEV from Figure 3C and 3D, but it is difficult for a reader to assess this as most of the dots are unlabeled and the primary data are not uploaded. A few potential suggestions would be to have a table of each ortholog with % infection by VSV and % infection by VEEV. Another possibility would be to plot these data as an XY scatter plot. This would highlight any species that deviate from the expected linear relationship between the inhibition of these two viruses, which would provide a larger panel of interesting IFIT1 antiviral specificities than the smaller number of species shown in Figure 4.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This manuscript by McDougal et al, demonstrates species-specific activities of diverse IFIT1 orthologs and seeks to utilize evolutionary analysis to identify key amino acids under positive selection that contribute to the antiviral activity of this host factor. While the authors identify amino acid residues as important for the antiviral activity of some orthologs and propose a possible mechanism by which these residues may function, the significance or applicability of these findings to other orthologs is unclear. However, the subject matter is of interest to the field, and these findings could be significantly strengthened with additional data.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Assessment of multiple IFIT1 orthologs shows the wide variety of antiviral activity of IFIT1, and identification of residues outside of the known RNA binding pocket in the protein suggests additional novel mechanisms that may regulate IFIT1 activity.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Consideration of alternative hypotheses that might explain the variable and seemingly inconsistent antiviral activity of IFIT1 orthologs was not really considered. For example, studies show that IFIT1 activity may be regulated by interaction with other IFIT proteins but was not assessed in this study.</p>
<p>Given that there appears to be very little overlap observed in orthologs that inhibited the viruses tested, it's possible that other amino acids may be key drivers of antiviral activity in these other orthologs. Thus, it's difficult to conclude whether the findings that residues 362/4/6 are important for IFIT1 activity can be broadly applied to other orthologs, or whether these are unique to human and chimpanzee IFIT1. Similarly, while the hypothesis that these residues impact IFIT1 activity in an allosteric manner is an attractive one, there is no data to support this.</p>

<p>We are grateful to the reviewers for their thoughtful and constructive feedback on our manuscript. Based on the Public Reviews, we will address the concerns raised by each reviewer through a combination of new analyses, clarifications, and expanded discussion as outlined below:</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #1:</bold></p>
<p>(1) Integration of Positive Selection Results:</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We will enhance the integration of positive selection analyses throughout the manuscript. Specifically, we will discuss how the positively selected sites in primates, including site 193, inform IFIT1 function. We will expand the discussion to explain how PAML, FUBAR, and MEME complement each other and why MEME did not detect site 193 in primates. Additionally, we will provide a rationale for focusing on the three sites identified in primates and address the overlap with bat orthologs.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) Expression Levels and Antiviral Activity:</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We acknowledge the variability in IFIT1 ortholog expression levels. To address this, we will quantify and normalize protein expression to GAPDH across all orthologs, allowing for a more accurate comparison of antiviral activity. We will revise the text to clarify that species-specific diVerences in viral suppression may be influenced by expression levels.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) Clarification of Terminology and Data Interpretation:</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We will refine our description of the antiviral eVects observed for SINV in Figure 4E. We will also revise statements related to protein expression in the relevant sections to improve accuracy.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) Cohesion of Data:</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We will work to more tightly connect the evolutionary analysis with the functional virology data, framing the manuscript around how positive selection shapes IFIT1 function across species.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #2:</bold></p>
<p>(1) Recombination Analysis of IFIT1:</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We will conduct a recombination analysis using GARD from the HyPhy package to ensure that the signatures of positive selection are not confounded by recombination between IFIT1 and IFIT1B.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) Clarification of IFIT1 Homologs Studied:</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We will provide additional details on how IFIT1 orthologs were selected, including addressing the relationship between IFIT1 and IFIT1B. We will support this by presenting additional sequence comparisons to demonstrate the orthology of the proteins studied.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) Chimpanzee IFIT1 Loss of Function:</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We will revise the discussion of chimpanzee IFIT1 to better reflect the data.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) Presentation of Antiviral Specificity Data:</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We will include a supplementary table listing the percentage of infection normalized to control by VSV and VEEV for each ortholog to allow for clearer comparisons.</p>
<p>Additionally, we will provide an alternative visualization to better compare the data sets.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #3:</bold></p>
<p>(1) Alternative Hypotheses for IFIT1 Antiviral Activity such as IFIT1-IFIT interactions:</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We will expand the discussion to consider alternative hypotheses, including the potential for IFIT1 activity to be regulated through interactions with other IFIT family members. Therefore, we will address how IFIT1-IFIT interactions may be broadly applicable to our findings with IFIT1 orthologs. In addition, we will clarify that we do not conclude that residues 362/4/6 are the sole drivers of antiviral specificity across the orthologs tested in this study.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) Generalization of Findings Across Orthologs:</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We acknowledge that the functional importance of residues 362/4/6 may not be generalizable across all orthologs. We will discuss this limitation more explicitly in the manuscript, while also expanding on how these findings apply specifically to primate IFIT1 orthologs.</p>
<p>We believe that these revisions will address the key concerns raised by the reviewers and strengthen the manuscript. We look forward to submitting the revised version for further consideration.</p>
