<title>Abstract</title><p>Despite the central role of T cells in tumor immunity, attempts to harness their cytotoxic capacity as a therapy have met limited efficacy, partially as a result of the suppressive microenvironment which limits their migration and activation. In contrast, myeloid cells massively infiltrate tumors and are well adapted to survive in these harsh conditions. While they are equipped with cell-killing abilities, they often adapt an immunosuppressive phenotype upon migration to tumors. Therefore, the questions of how to modify their activation programing against cancer, and what signaling cascades should be activated in myeloid cells to elicit their cytotoxicity has remained unclear.</p>
<p>Here, we found that activation of IgM-induced signaling in myeloid cells results in secretion of lytic granules and massive tumor cell death. These findings open venues for designing novel immunotherapy by equipping monocytes with chimeric receptors that target tumor antigens and consequently, signal through IgM receptor. Nonetheless, we found that myeloid cells do not express the antibody-derived portion used to recognize the tumor antigen due to induction of an ER stress response. To overcome this limitation, we designed chimeric receptors that are based on the high affinity FcγRI for IgG. Incubation of macrophages transfected with these receptors along with tumor-binding IgG induced massive tumor cell killing and secretion of reactive oxygen species and Granzyme B.</p>
<p>Overall, this work highlights the challenges involved in genetically reprograming the signaling in myeloid cells and provides a framework for endowing myeloid cells with antigen-specific cytotoxicity.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Clinical and experimental data have highlighted the important role of the immune cell function and composition in determining tumor progression or eradication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>). While high prevalence of tumor-infiltrating T cells is associated with improved prognosis and survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>), infiltration of myeloid cells is often associated with poor prognosis and tumor refractory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>). Based on these findings, vast scientific effort is executed to increase the host’s T cell response to cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>). In most cases however, tumor reactive T cells generated spontaneously by the host bear low to moderate affinity (10<sup>-4</sup>M-10<sup>-6</sup>M) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>), which is below the activation threshold needed for therapeutic effect, and attempts to increase TCR affinity using genetical engineering are often limited by induction of cross reactivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>).</p>
<p>To overcome these limitations, T cells can be genetically modified to express Chimeric Antigen receptor (CAR) consisting of Single Chain Fragment Variable (scFv) for tumor antigen recognition fused to T cell signaling domains (e.g. CD3ζ, CD28) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>). Engineered cells are reinfused into the patient, providing the host’s immune system with T cells capable of specifically recognizing tumor antigens in an MHC-independent fashion. Indeed, this strategy benefits from overcoming the complex, multistep and highly regulated activation process of T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>) and has been proven remarkably successful in treating liquid tumors.</p>
<p>However, the harsh microenvironment characterizing solid tumors manifests a major limitation to T cell-based treatments. Hypoxic and acidic conditions at tumor sites, along with immunosuppressive capacity of tumor cells limit T cell infiltration, survival, and cytotoxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>). In contrast to T cells, myeloid cells migrate efficiently into the tumor mass and are well adapted to survive and function under this harsh environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>). However, while myeloid cells are potentially able to produce cytotoxic compounds, they acquire an immunosuppressive phenotype once in the vicinity of the tumor cells and promote tumor growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>). Hence, equipping myeloid cells with means to release cytotoxic compounds following recognition of tumor-antigens may provide a new therapeutic strategy. While recognition of tumors can be facilitated through scFv, which signaling chains should be fused are not clear. Early attempts to generate CAR myeloid cells have fused to CD3 zetta chain, which may function in these cells as Fc gamma chain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>). Yet, what signaling cascades should be induced in myeloid cells to elicit their cytotoxicity has remained unclear.</p>
<p>Here, we found that activation of the IgM receptor signaling in myeloid cells, induce massive killing of tumor cells. However, we found that in contrast to lymphoid cells, which can ectopically express scFv, myeloid cells identify it as a misfolded protein and rapidly degrade it. Instead, we modified the high affinity FcγRI, which normally bind IgG, to transmit IgM receptor-driven signals, while recognition of tumor antigens is mediated by IgG tumor-binding antibodies. Indeed, incubation of mRNA-engineered myeloid cells with tumor cells resulted in massive tumor cell killing only in the presence of IgG tumor-binding antibodies. Overall, this work suggests a novel mean to endow myeloid cells with antigen-specific killing abilities and harness their capacity to migrate and survive in the harsh conditions at the tumor microenvironment.</p>

<title>IgM-induced signaling elicits cytotoxic response in macrophages and can be integrated to a CAR design</title>
<p>We have previously demonstrated that MHC-matched allogenic tumors, which spontaneously regressed, are coated with IgG and IgM antibodies soon after tumor initiation and are found in proximity to tumor-infiltrating myeloid cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>). While we characterized the therapeutic role of tumor-binding IgG and their interactions with dendritic cells (DC)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>), the role of IgM in facilitating DC-mediated immunity has remained unclear. To address that, we initially compared their capacity to induce tumor immunity in a prophylactic tumor immunization assay. To this end, we incubated monocyte-derived dendritic cells (MoDC) with immune complexes (IC) composed of B16F10 tumor cells coated with allogenic IgG or IgM and injected them subcutaneously (s.c) to syngeneic mice (illustrated in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). After two rounds of immunization, five days apart, mice were challenged with B16F10 cells and tumor size was monitored over time. We found that incubation of MoDC with IgG-IC, but not with IgM-IC, induced T cell immunity and prevented tumor growth (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>). We noticed however, that incubation <italic>in vitro</italic> of MoDC with tumor cells coated with allogenic IgM but not with IgG, resulted in a massive killing of the tumor cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>). To assess the underlying killing mechanisms, we measured the levels of nitric oxide (NO) and granzyme B (GrB) in the supernatants of overnight cultures. Consistent with their killing rates, significantly higher levels of both GrB and NO were detected upon incubation with allogenic IgM-IC (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>), indicating that both secretion of reactive oxygen species and lysosome deposition are involved in the killing. To further assess what signaling cascade is induced by IgM-IC, we tested the levels of major inflammatory cytokines and phosphorylated enzymes. Activation with IgG-IC induced classical singling through Fcγ receptors, characterized by high levels of TNFα and IL12, and activation of enzymes in the MAP kinase pathway (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>-<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1F</xref>). The phenotype of IgM-IC activated MoDC was more complicated and characterized in low levels of TNFα and high IL-12, suggesting that Akt was only partially phosphorylated. Flow cytometric analysis indicated only neglectable levels of Akt phosphorylation, while ERK and p38 phosphorylation was comparable to that induced by IgG-IC along with higher levels of phospho-JNK (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>-<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1F</xref>). This somewhat unique signaling cascade most likely indicates a combination of several signaling chains recruited by IgM, including Fcγ and C1q receptors.</p>

<p>To harness this signaling cascades to induce tumor cytotoxicity, we designed Chimeric Antigen Receptors (CAR) in which the antigen recognition region, a single chain fragment variable (scFv) derived from TA99 antibody, targets the melanoma antigen gp75, as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>). The scFv, consisting of Variable light (V<sub>L</sub>) and variable heavy (V<sub>H</sub>) chains was attached to a spacer region of Constant Heavy subunits 1-3 (CH<sub>1-3</sub>). These subunits were fused to several potential IgM signaling chains in the transmembrane and intracellular regions and fused to a fluorescence tag to aid detection of expression (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1G</xref>). Next, we transfected HEK 293FT cells with the CAR constructs to test their expressions and cellular localization using confocal microscopy and flow cytometry. Indeed, all constructs were expressed on cell membrane within 24 hours (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1H</xref>-<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1I</xref>).</p>

<p>Next, we sought to test the constructs expressions and functionality in myeloid cells. To this end, we transfected two established murine cell lines of dendritic cells (DC2.4) and macrophages (RAW 2.64) with our three constructs and with mCherry as a control plasmid. In both cell lines about 30 percent of the cells expressed mCherry. In sharp contrast, however, we were unable to detect any construct expression in myeloid cells by either confocal microscopy or flow cytometric analysis (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>-<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2C</xref> and Supplementary Fig. S1A). To test if this phenomenon would also occur in human cells, we transfected THP1 monocyte cell line in comparison to Jurkat T cell line. Consistent with our results using mouse cells, we could not detect any CAR expression in THP1 cells, while in Jurakt cells their expression was comparable to mCherry transfection rates (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>-<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2E</xref>).</p>

<p>Since we could not detect expression of our constructs in myeloid cells, we sought to characterize the subunit leading to inhibition of expression by generating various constructs, in which different segments of CAR are omitted. Since myeloid cells were reported to express TRM21 E3 ligases that bind C<sub>H</sub>1 and C<sub>H</sub>2 fragments of internalized IgG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>), we next generated a CAR construct with a minimal spacer region by elimination of Constant Heavy domain 1 and 2 (C<sub>H</sub>1, C<sub>H</sub>2) and tested the expression of these constructs in DC2.4 cell line. However, consistent with our previous results, we were unable to detect any protein expression (Supplementary Fig. S1B-S1C). We then removed the rest of the spacers, generating a construct consisting only of the scFv region and an intracellular signaling domain. As with our previous finding, no expression in myeloid cell lines was detected (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2F</xref>-<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2G</xref>). Similarly, removal of the intracellular portion did not alter the expression patterns of TA99-derived scFv, suggesting that the scFv domains may be the element that prevents its expression (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2G</xref>-<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2H</xref>). To verify that these expression patterns do not stem from the use of mCherry, we have also fused these constructs to GFP. Nonetheless, in both cases the presence of scFv prevented protein expression in macrophages and DC (Supplementary Fig. S1C).</p>
<p>To test if this phenomenon is restricted to TA99 CAR or reflects a broader phenomenon, we sought to compare TA99 CAR to a well-established anti-CD19-derived scFv. Towards this end, we generated a plasmid that contains the CD8 signal peptide followed by αCD19-derived scFv and fused to CD8a spacer and transmembrane portion, and an identical one that lack the scFv part (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2H</xref>). Interestingly, while we detected low levels of αCD19-derived ScFv, they were localized in intracellular compartments and not on the cell membrane (supplementary Fig. S1D). Removal of scFv domain enabled expression of the inserted protein in the Golgi and cell membrane of both macrophages and DC cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2H-2I</xref> and Supplementary Fig. S1E).</p>

<title>Both VH and VL domains prevent expression of scFv in myeloid cells</title>
<p>We next aimed to test which portion of scFv prevents its membranal expression. Initially, we designed two plasmids in which all other signaling subunits were removed, leaving only the TA99- or αCD19-derived scFv fragment. As with our previous findings, here too we were not able to detect intracellular TA99-nor αCD19-derived scFv expression (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A-3B</xref>). To test the possibility that the location of the fluorescent tag inhibits scFv expression, we transfected DC2.4 with a GFP is fused to the C-terminus of αCD19-derived scFv. Similarly, this protein did not lead to scFv expression (Supplementary Fig. S2A). Next, we generated plasmids consisting of minimal subunits, consisting of only the variable light or variable heavy domains of TA99 and αCD19. While expression levels were somewhat higher in these constructs, compared to the full length of scFv, they were still benign and significantly lower compared to GFP only (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C-3E</xref>).</p>

<p>As a result, we sought to further investigate whether the primary proteins structure of amino acid sequence or the tertiary immunoglobulin structure of the scFv subunits prevent the expression. To this end we inserted point mutations that switched cysteine amino acids to glycine, creating a linear protein by preventing disulfide bonds. Interestingly, linearization of αCD19 variable light chain (or heavy chain) had only marginal effect of its expression patterns and resulted in reduced and compartmentalized expressions (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3F-3H</xref>). In addition, we generated a plasmid that consisted of the first and last 15 amino acids of variable light chain which includes the cysteine amino acids for di-sulfide bond formation. This fragment was almost inert, and its expression patterns were comparable to that of GFP only (Supplementary Fig. S2B). We also tested whether specific fragments within the variable light chain sequence prevented its expression. Dividing the light chains of αCD19 scFv to three sequences resulted in a high expression in myeloid cells, albeit tending to induce different expression patterns of cellular compartmentalization (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3G-3H</xref>). Taken jointly, our results suggest that the linear form of either the variable light or the heavy chain of antibodies results in a poor and compartmentalized protein expression compared to the full length of ScFv to a lesser extent</p>

<title>scFv induce ER stress in myeloid cells</title>
<p>To elucidate the level at which scFv constructs are silenced, we sought to transfect cells of myeloid lineage with mRNA composed of αCD19 scFv fused to a green fluorescent protein tag. Nonetheless, this form of transfection did not lead to expression of scFv in myeloid cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4A</xref>). Additionally, we measured the mRNA levels of GFP mRNA in mouse myeloid cells following transfection with αCD19 scFv-GFP vectors, in comparison to GFP only or to Fc receptor fused to GFP (which are robustly expressed in these cells). Similar levels of GFP mRNA were detected in all transfected cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4B</xref>.). Based on these findings we speculate that the negative regulation on scFv expression is not evident at the mRNA level.</p>

<p>To further assess this possibility, we utilized 2A ribosomal skipping peptide in order to test if scFv is regulated at the post translational level. Hence, we generated plasmids containing GFP fluorescence tag followed by T2A skipping peptide, succeeded with TA99 scFv fused to mCherry, all in one reading frame. This design allowed us to test if the GFP and scFv expression are coupled, thus indicating that the regulation is made on the mRNA transcript and prior to protein translation. Alternatively, expression of one fluorescent tag would indicate that the regulation is made at the protein level following translation. While we detected both tags (GFP, mCherry) in HEK293 cells, only GFP was expressed in myeloid cells, but not the mCherry which was fused to scFv (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>). Eliminating the T2A skipping peptide from this construct, generating a plasmid containing GFP tag fused to TA99 scFv succeeded by mCherry, resulted in abrogated and reduced expression levels of both fluorescent tags in myeloid cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref>). These results therefore suggest that scFv expression is regulated on the protein level.</p>
<p>Consistent with this notion, we found that scFv is expressed in myeloid cell at earlier time points, starting at four hours post transfection and peaking at about 6 hours (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E</xref>). In order to determine the mechanism through which scFv is degraded, we next performed proteomics of immunoprecipitated scFv. Hence, macrophages were transfected with GFP only, or GFP fused to αCD19 scFv. After 6 hours, GFP-expressing cells were sorted and lysed, and associated proteins were pulled down using anti-GFP conjugated beads. Eluted proteins were then sent to analyses by mass spectrometry (illustrated in Supplementary Fig.S3A). Analysis of protein interactors with scFv in myeloid cells indicated that scFv fraction was statistically enriched with proteins associated with ER stress that could promote scFv degradation (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4F</xref>). To further corroborate that possibility, we assessed the co-localization scFv with key proteins in this pathway. Confocal microscopy corroborated that the majority of αCD19 scFv were localized at the endoplasmic reticulum (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4G</xref>) and co-localized with BIP (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4H</xref>) and G3BP1(Supplementary Fig.S3B), which are master regulators of ER stress. Lastly, flow cytometric analysis indicated higher levels of phospho-JNK (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4I</xref>).</p>

<p>Consequently, we sought to characterize the effect of tumor-binding antibodies on macrophage cytotoxic activity. To this end, we co-incubated tdTomato-labeled 4T1 tumor cell lines expressing human HER2<sup>+</sup> with RAW264.7 cells that constitutively express the chimeric receptors with and without the anti-HER2<sup>+</sup> antibody <italic>trastuzumab</italic>. Confocal microscopy indicated that RAW264.7 alone had no cytotoxic activity following a 24h incubation. In contrast, the addition of <italic>trastuzumab</italic> induced a polarized accumulation of GrB in the synapse between macrophages and tumor cells. Significantly higher levels of GrB in the immune synapse were counted in cells expressing C5aR chimeric receptor (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5F</xref>-<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5G</xref> and Supplementary Fig. S4A). To quantify the killing capacity of this construct, we next transfected RAW26.4 macrophages with mRNA which encode these modified receptors and incubated them with fluorescently labeled HER2<sup>+</sup> expressing 4T1 tumor cells under IncuCyte. Consistent with GrB polarization, transfect macrophages alone were almost completely inert whereas addition of <italic>trastuzumab</italic> promoted tumor cells killing (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5H</xref>). Importantly, while killing rates of macrophages expressing C5aR chimeric receptor were higher, they were also induced by free and irrelevant antibody (e.g. rituximab) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5H</xref>).</p>
<p>To assess the underlying mechanism, we analyzed the transfected RAW264.7 cells under high-resolution microscopy. In steady state, cells transfected with the native FcγRI had a clear separation between the alpha chain (antibody binding chain) and their signaling gamma chain. The addition of free trastuzumab did not alter their membranal architecture. Incubation with plastic-immobilized <italic>trastuzumab</italic> resulted in polarization of the alpha chain toward the plastic and co-localization with the gamma chain. The architecture of C5aR chimeric receptor completely abrogated the membrane organization of the signaling chains, as the two co-localized even under steady state (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5I</xref> and Supplementary Fig. S4B). We then speculated that the fusion of such signaling chain to the alpha chain could mitigate the effects of tonic signaling by attaching IgM receptor signaling chain, instead of the gamma chain, to the transmembrane domain (illustrated in Supplementary Fig. 4C). Indeed, this architecture can be highly expressed in macrophage membrane and did not recruit or abrogated the gamma chain upon addition of antibodies, while maintaining alpha chain clustering to immobilized <italic>trastuzumab</italic> (Supplementary Fig. S4D-S4F). Lastly, this construct promotes polarized expression of GrB at the immunological synapse and induces an antibody-specific tumor cell lysis (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5J</xref>-<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5K</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The microenvironment of most solid tumors is often enriched with myeloid cells at different stages of maturity and polarization and the general notion suggests that they often adapt a suppressive phenotype which support tumor progression and escape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>). The inherent plasticity of these cells, however, enables them to change their phenotype upon injection of adjuvant or immune-stimulatory agents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>). Countless experimental and clinical data have been tested for their capacity to convert tumor-infiltrating myeloid cells phenotype to an anti-tumor, including TLR agonists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>), immune complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>), immune checkpoints (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>) and co-stimulatory antibodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>). While they showed improved T cell infiltration and overall lower tumor burden, they did not meet the expectations. It is noteworthy that most of these attempts are based on the notion that CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells are the main effector arm against cancer and that the purpose of myeloid cell activation is to support T cell mediated killing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>). Nonetheless, myeloid cells are highly equipped with cell killing mechanisms, including ADCC, and secretion of reactive oxygen species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>). Here, we demonstrated that activating the IgM-receptor signaling in myeloid cells using tumor-binding IgG induces oxidative burst, Granzyme release, and massive tumor cell lysis.</p>
<p>While genetic engineering of immune cells to treat cancer has proven to be successful in lymphoid cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>), cells of the myeloid lineage resist gene modification. Noteworthily, these cells are traditionally thought to be programmed to respond to foreign genetic materials. Early attempts to overcome this inherent barrier were achieved by Biglari et al. using adenoviral vectors. They demonstrated that the fusion of scFv against CEA to FcγR can be expressed in monocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>). Although this construct leads to granzyme release in T cells, its function in monocytes remained obscure. Further attempts to equip macrophages with specific tumor antigen recognition were done by Morrissey et al. They fused scFv derived from αCD19 antibody to different signaling chains that facilitate phagocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>). Interestingly, most of these receptors do not appear to be expressed on the cell membrane. Moreover, CAR-merTK, which appears on the cell membrane, was functionally inert and did not induce phagocytosis.</p>
<p>Recently, Klichinsky et al. have also attempted to genetically modify macrophages using an adenoviral vector expressing αCD19 and αHER2 Chimeric Antigen Receptor fused to CD3ζ − CD28 signaling domains. They suggested that this strategy can be applied to kill HER2-expressing tumor cells through phagocytosis. While the authors demonstrated expression by flow cytometry, they did not attempt to identify the membranous localization in macrophages. It may also be that use of Adeno-associated viruses (AAV) as transduction vector enable to overcome the inflammatory cascade induced in myeloid cells as a result of liposome-based transfection or lentiviral transduction, thus enabling expression. With that being said, the authors concluded that the improved survival induced in mice was due to M1-like phenotype induce in transduced macrophages by the virus, rather than the CAR construct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>).</p>
<p>Why scFv induces ER-stress specifically in myeloid cells remains unclear. Activation of ER stress by misfolded proteins in macrophages plays a dominant role in many human pathologies, yet it also occurs in other cell types. One possible explanation is that these cells lack the machinery needed for successful folding of antibody-like structures. Along these lines, many non-immune cells such as HeLa or HEK293 cells initiate ER-stress response upon transfection of fragments derived from immune-associated receptors such as the alpha chain of the T cell receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>).</p>
<p>Overall, this work highlights the challenges involved in genetically reprograming the signaling in myeloid cells and the need for new genetic scaffolds other than scFv. Instead, we suggest FcγRI as a new genetic scaffold for modulating myeloid cells signaling as a therapeutic strategy against solid cancer.</p>

<p>The significance of this work is <bold>important</bold> in that the authors propose a novel method to therapeutically harness myeloid cells which can be otherwise immunosuppressive and hamper T cell and immunotherapy responses. The strength of evidence is <bold>convincing</bold> but requires critical pieces of in vivo work to validate the therapeutic efficacy of this approach.</p>

<p>Farhat-Younis and colleagues demonstrate tumor-specific IgM's capacity to induce tumor cell death in monocyte-derived dendritic cell cultures. They subsequently designed a chimeric receptor based on high-affinity FcRI. However, the authors found that the transfection process was more efficient when either the variable light or heavy chain was transfected individually rather than the entire scFv. This scFv construct led to an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response and scFv degradation. A considerable portion of the manuscript is dedicated to the negative scFv expression results. The authors pivoted to a modified FcgRI capable of transmitting IgM signals. This represents a tremendous amount of work in the development of this chimeric receptor, the critical experiment showing efficacy in vivo was not presented, and instead various in vitro assays are shown. Thus, this manuscript will markedly benefit from showing improved responses to tumors in vivo when macrophages express FcgRI-IgM.</p>
<p>1. In a mouse tumor model, the authors demonstrated that monocyte-derived dendritic cells (MoDCs) treated with IgG immune complexes (ICs) were more effective at preventing tumor growth compared to those treated with IgM ICs (as shown in Figure 1B). In Figure 1C, their in vitro experiments revealed that IgM resulted in tumor cell death, as well as increased production of nitric oxide (NO) and granzyme B.</p>
<p>
How do the authors reconcile IgG IC-treated MoDCs performing better in preventing tumors in vivo than IgM IC-treated MoDCs, despite the in vitro results with IgM-ICs. The authors speculate that IgG IC-treated MoDCs might trigger T cell immunity but do not show T cell involvement.</p>
<p>2. The authors report distinct functional consequences of MoDCs incubated with tumor-IgG complexes and tumor IgM complexes. Tumor growth was inhibited and T cell immunity induced with the former. The latter, however, elicited robust anti-tumor killing. What happens if MoDCs are incubated with both IgG and IgM complexes? If this combined treatment induces effective killing and T cell memory, would this impact the design of the chimeric receptor to include IgG responsiveness as well?</p>
<p>3. In Figure 5H, the authors demonstrate the ability of the chimeric receptor construct to deplete tumor cells in vitro. The ms would improve if the authors could show the chimeric receptor construct results in tumor cell death and/or prevention in an in vivo model. Similarly, if combined stimulation with IgG and IgM complexes enhances tumor response, this should be incorporated into the therapeutic strategy.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>While a significant portion of immunotherapy research has focused on the pivotal role of T cells in tumor immunity, their effectiveness may be limited by the suppressive nature of the tumor environment. On the other hand, myeloid cells are commonly found within tumors and can withstand these adverse conditions. However, these cells often adopt an immunosuppressive phenotype when infiltrating tumors. Therefore, manipulating myeloid cells could potentially enhance the anti-tumor potential of immunotherapy.</p>
<p>In this manuscript, Farhat-Younes and colleagues have demonstrated that activating the IgM receptor signaling in myeloid cells induces an oxygen burst, the secretion of Granzyme B, and the lysis of adjacent tumor cells. Furthermore, they have outlined a strategy to utilize these features to generate CAR macrophages. However, they have identified a limitation: the expression of scFv in myeloid cells induces ER stress and the degradation of misfolded proteins. To address this issue, chimeric receptors were designed based on the high-affinity FcγRI for IgG. When macrophages transfected with these receptors were exposed to tumor-binding IgG, extensive tumor cell killing, and the release of reactive oxygen species and Granzyme B were observed.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
In general, I consider this work to be significant, and the results are compelling. It emphasizes the specific considerations and requirements for successful manipulation in myeloid cells, which could further advance the field of cellular engineering for the benefit of immunotherapy</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Nevertheless, there are several minor issues that should be addressed:</p>
<p>1- TCR fragments are commonly used to induce ER stress in non-immune cells. Therefore, it would be interesting to investigate whether TCR fragments can be expressed in myeloid cells and if they induce ER stress. Addressing this issue would support the notion that these cells lack the ER chaperones required for folding immunoglobulin variable chains.</p>
<p>
2- It would be valuable to determine whether, after the degradation of scFv fragments by myeloid cells, they are presented on MHC-I and MHC-II.</p>
<p>
3- Some methodological details, such as the vaccination protocol and high-resolution microscopy procedures, are missing from the text.</p>
