<title>Abstract</title>
<p>New experimental findings continue to challenge our understanding of protein allostery. Recent deep mutational scanning study showed that allosteric hotspots in the tetracycline repressor (TetR) and its homologous transcriptional factors are broadly distributed rather than spanning well-defined structural pathways as often assumed. Moreover, hotspot mutation-induced allostery loss was rescued by distributed additional mutations in a degenerate fashion. Here, we develop a two-domain thermodynamic model for TetR, which readily rationalizes these intriguing observations. The model accurately captures the in vivo activities of various mutants with changes in physically transparent parameters, allowing the data-based quantification of mutational effects using statistical inference. Our analysis reveals the intrinsic connection of intra- and inter-domain properties for allosteric regulation and illustrate epistatic interactions that are consistent with structural features of the protein. The insights gained from this study into the nature of two-domain allostery are expected to have broader implications for other multidomain allosteric proteins.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Allostery, a fundamental regulatory mechanism of biomolecular functions, is prevalent in life processes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Bacon (1965)</xref>; Koshland Jr et al. (1966); <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Changeux and Edelstein (2005)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Cui and Karplus (2008)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Motlagh et al.

The long-range signaling of allostery makes it a fascinating phenomenon, in which binding of an effector molecule (ligand) at the allosteric site alters the function of a distal active site <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Dokholyan (2016)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Leander et al.

Current descriptions of allostery can be largely cast into two categories: one adopts a mechanical view, focusing on the propagation of conformational distortions from the allosteric site to the active site <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Wang et al. (2020)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Lockless and Ranganathan (1999)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Daily and Gray (2009)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Rodriguez et al. (2010)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Lee et al. (2008)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Walker et al. (2020)</xref>; the other emphasizes the thermodynamic aspect of the problem, high-lighting the effect of ligand binding on shifting the protein population among pre-existing conformational states characterized by different ligand binding affinities and active site properties (e.g., the classic MWC model) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Bacon (1965)</xref>; Koshland Jr et al. (1966); <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Changeux and Edelstein (2005)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Cui and Karplus (2008)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Sevvana et al. (2012)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Takeuchi et al. (2019)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Marzen et al. (2013)</xref>. Models based on both perspectives have provided insights into the function of prototypical allosteric systems thanks to decades of combined efforts of experiment, computation and theory <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Cui and Karplus (2008)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Motlagh et al. (2014)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Dokholyan (2016)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Marzen et al.

(2009)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Xu et al. (2003)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Nierzwicki et al. (2021)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">East et al. (2019)</xref>. Of note, these two perspectives of allostery are complementary rather than contradictory to each other <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Liu and Nussinov (2016)</xref>. The conformational coupling between spatially distant functional sites (allosteric site and active site) plays a vital role in regulating allosteric function, allowing for the transmission of signals from one site to the other Zhang et al. (2020). While the mechanical view primarily seeks to identify the structural basis for signal transduction, it is implicitly assumed within the population shift perspective, which offers a comprehensive and quantitative description of allostery <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Szabo and Karplus (1972)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Viappiani et al. (2014)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Henry et al. (2020)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Eaton (2022)</xref>.</p>
<p>In recent years, a thermodynamic model referred to as the ensemble allosteric model (EAM) has been applied to conceptualize protein allostery in terms of intra- and inter-domain properties, with the latter explicitly quantifying the energetic coupling between distant functional sites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Motlagh et al. (2014)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Wodak et al. (2019)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Hilser et al. (2012)</xref>. This framework is consistent with the observation that allosteric proteins often partition different activities into distinct domains, such as the ligand- and DNA-binding domains in transcription factors and the effector-binding and catalytic domains in enzymes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Ramos et al. (2005)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Tzeng and Kalodimos (2012)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Velyvis et al. (2007)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Lipscomb and Kantrowitz (2012)</xref>. Such thermodynamic approach finds broad applicability across proteins in general, as it has been proposed that all proteins are potentially allosteric Zhang et al. (2020); <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Gunasekaran et al. (2004)</xref>. Consequently, this raises intriguing questions about the nature of allostery. For instance, do intrinsic connections exist between the intra- and inter-domain properties of a protein, given the highly cooperative nature of allosteric networks? What roles do sequence and structure play in synergistically determining these properties? Furthermore, what are the parameters within the model that are most essential to the accurate description of realistic allosteric systems, especially prediction of activity upon multiple mutations? To answer these questions and deepen our understanding of allosteric regulation, it is essential to parameterize and test the thermodynamic model using comprehensive mutational data, a topic that still requires further exploration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Leander et al. (2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">2022</xref>).</p>
<p>A critical test of any thermodynamic model is whether it can explain the effect of mutations on allosteric signaling. Deep mutational scanning (DMS) analysis has emerged as a powerful function-centric approach over the past decade, which measures the impact of all possible single mutations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Fowler et al. (2010)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Fowler and Fields (2014)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Sarkisyan et al. (2016)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Flynn et al. (2019)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Starr et al. (2020)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Huss et al. (2021)</xref>. The methodology provides an unbiased way of identifying critical residues for protein allostery and generates extensive data for validating existing computational and theoretical models. Along this line, recent DMS study of four homologous bacterial transcription factors (TFs) in the TetR family (TetR, TtgR, MphR and RolR) revealed that the residues critical for allosteric signaling (hotspots) in these TFs are broadly distributed with no apparent structural link to either the allosteric or the active site <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Leander et al. (2022)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Tack et al. (2021)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Faure et al. (2022)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Jones et al. (2020)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">McCormick et al. (2021)</xref>. This contrasts the commonly held view that hotspot residues tend to form well-defined pathways linking the two sites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Süel et al. (2003)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Ota and Agard (2005)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Strickland et al. (2008)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Reynolds et al. (2011)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Amor et al. (2016)</xref>; the observations also hinted at common molecular rules of allostery in the TetR family of TFs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Cuthbertson and Nodwell (2013)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Fukami-Kobayashi et al. (2003)</xref>. Moreover, systematic analysis of higher order TetR mutants in the background of five noninducible (“dead”) mutants revealed remarkable functional plasticity in allosteric regulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Leander et al. (2020)</xref>. Specifically, the loss of inducibility due to the mutations of allostery hotspots could be rescued (restored wildtype-like inducibility) by additional mutations, and different dead mutations exhibit varying numbers of rescuing mutations, which are usually distal and lacking any obvious structural rationale.</p>
<p>While the identification of broadly distributed dead and rescuing mutations in these studies is exciting, such qualitative activity characterization of mutants (inducible and noninducible at a given ligand concentration) prevents a deeper mechanistic understanding of the observation. In fact, mutations exert a graded impact on the allosteric signaling of the TFs; i.e., the expression level of the regulated gene varies among both inducible and noninducible mutants in a continuous, ligand-concentration dependent manner. The nuanced mutational effect on allosteric regulation is linked apparently to the equilibria among different conformational and binding states of the mutant TF, which are determined by the allosteric parameters (intra- and inter-domain properties). Therefore, mapping the mutants onto the parameter space of a biophysical model by exploiting additional experimental data (see below) is crucial for elucidating the observed allosteric phenomena in a comprehensive and physically transparent manner.</p>
<p>In this study, we develop a two-domain statistical thermodynamic model for TetR, in which the protein is generically divided into ligand- and DNA-binding domains (LBD and DBD). Our model incorporates three essential biophysical parameters that capture the intra- and inter-domain properties of the protein, as elaborated in the subsequent section. The model readily rationalizes the myriad ways that mutations can perturb allostery as observed in the aforementioned DMS measurements, by revealing that mutations perturbing intra- and inter-domain properties can lead to similar TF inducibilities at a single ligand concentration. Moreover, the model elucidates the distinct influences of these parameters on the complete induction curve, serving as a diagnostic tool for dissecting the intricate allosteric effects of mutations. We validate the model by accurately describing the induction curves of a comprehensive set of TetR mutants, thereby enabling the quantification of mutational effects and epistatic interactions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Daber et al. (2011)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Chure et al. (2019)</xref>. The insights from this combined theoretical and experimental investigation of TetR allostery are expected to generally apply to other two-domain allosteric systems, such as transcription factors like catabolite activator protein (CAP) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Tzeng and Kalodimos (2012)</xref>, receptors like pentameric ligand-gated ion channels (pLGICs) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Sauguet et al. (2015)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Hu et al.

<title>Overview of the two-domain thermodynamic model of allostery</title>
<p>As shown in <bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 1A and B</italic></xref></bold>, TetR can be generically divided into a LBD and a DBD, disregarding its homodimeric nature <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Leander et al. (2020)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Takeuchi et al. (2019)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Reichheld et al. (2009)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Leander et al. (2022)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Yuan et al. (2022)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Scholz et al. (2004)</xref>. In the same vein of the classic allostery models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Bacon (1965)</xref>; Koshland Jr et al. (1966), each domain features two (the relaxed/inactive and tense/active) conformations that differ in free energies and binding affinities. For the simplicity and mechanistic clarity of the model, we assume negligible binding affinity of the LBD to the lig- and and the DBD to DNA in their inactive conformations and consider competent binding only for the active ones. Each domain must overcome a free energy increase to transition from the inactive to the active conformation (ɛ<sub>L</sub> for LBD and ɛ<sub>D</sub> for DBD). Importantly, the two domains are allosterically coupled, in that there is a free energy penalty γ when both domains adopt the active conformations simultaneously. For example, when the ligand binds to the LBD, selecting its active conformation, it discourages the active conformation of the DBD and therefore DNA binding. This anti-cooperativity establishes the foundation for allosteric regulation in TetR.</p>

<p>Accordingly, there are four possible conformational states of TetR, namely L<sub>I</sub> D<sub>I</sub>, L<sub>A</sub> D<sub>I</sub>, L<sub>I</sub> D<sub>A</sub> and L<sub>A</sub> D<sub>A</sub>, with L/D and I/A denoting LBD/DBD and inactive/active conformation, respectively (see <bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 1B</italic></xref></bold> and the upper four states of <bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 1D</italic></xref></bold>). Binding of ligand/operator to the active LBD/DBD further lowers the free energy of the corresponding state in a concentration dependent manner following the standard formulation of binding equilibrium (see the lower three states of <bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 1D</italic></xref></bold>). The regulatory mechanism of TetR allostery can then be qualitatively explained by the schematics in <bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 1C and D</italic></xref></bold>. Without the ligand, wildtype (WT) repressor predominantly binds to the operator sequence, which obstructs the binding of RNA polymerase (RNAP) to the adjacent promoter of the regulated gene (<bold><xref rid="figs2_1" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 2—figure Supplement 1A</italic></xref></bold>). In the presence of ligand (inducer) at a sufficiently high concentration, the ligand-bound L<sub>A</sub> D<sub>I</sub> state (L-L<sub>A</sub> D<sub>I</sub>) has the lowest free energy compared with other possible (DNA-bound) states, thus the repressor predominantly releases the operator upon ligand binding, enabling the expression of downstream genes (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 1C</italic></xref></bold> and <bold><xref rid="figs2_1" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 2—figure Supplement 1A</italic></xref></bold>).</p>

<p>Mutations perturb the three biophysical parameters (ɛ<sub>D</sub>, ɛ<sub>L</sub> and γ) and hence the free energy landscape (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 1</italic></xref></bold>D), leading to changes in TetR function. The three limiting scenarios are depicted in <bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 1</italic></xref></bold>D: 1. when a mutation significantly increases ɛ<sub>L</sub>, it raises the free energy of the L-L<sub>A</sub> D<sub>I</sub> state relative to the DNA-bound state L<sub>I</sub> D<sub>A</sub> -D, which results in a dead (noninducible) phenotype; 2. when a mutation substantially decreases ɛ<sub>D</sub>, it raises the free energy of the L-L<sub>A</sub> D<sub>I</sub> state relative to both DNA-bound states (L<sub>I</sub> D<sub>A</sub> -D and L-L<sub>A</sub> D<sub>A</sub> -D), also leading to a dead mutant; 3. mutations that decrease γ greatly lower the free energy of the double-bound state (L-L<sub>A</sub> D<sub>A</sub> -D) relative to L-L<sub>A</sub> D<sub>I</sub>, again leading to the suppression of induction. Therefore, these schemes highlight that hotspot mutations can disrupt allostery by perturbing either intra- (ɛ<sub>D</sub>, ɛ<sub>L</sub>) or inter-domain (γ) properties. Functional readouts like DMS can help distinguish these mechanistic differences at the biophysical level. Notably, mutations mainly perturbing ɛ<sub>D</sub> or ɛ<sub>L</sub> do not have to lie on the structural pathways linking the allosteric and active sites, which explains the broad hotspot distributions observed in the DMS measurement <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Leander et al. (2020)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Reichheld et al. (2009)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Leander et al. (2022)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Scholz et al. (2004)</xref>. In general, a dead mutation is likely of mixed nature, as long as its effect on the free energy landscape promotes the dominance of the DNA-bound states. Likewise, rescuing mutations may restore WT-like inducibility by modifying intra- and inter-domain energetics in various ways, as far as the dominance of the L-L<sub>A</sub> D<sub>I</sub> state is re-established, rationalizing the broad rescuing mutation distributions. Naturally, the rescuability of a dead mutation depends on which biophysical parameters it perturbs and by how much. At a qualitative level, the distributed nature of dead and rescuing mutations observed in the DMS measurement emerges naturally from the two-domain model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Leander et al. (2020)</xref>.</p>
<p>In summary, the interplay of intra- and inter-domain properties that govern the free energy landscape of TetR’s conformational and binding states, as elucidated by the two-domain model, aligns well with the unexpected DMS results on a qualitative level. To gain deeper insight into TetR allostery and the model itself, we aim to establish a quantitative framework with the model that accurately captures mutant induction curves in the next section.</p>

<title>System-level ramifications of the two-domain model</title>
<p>The discussions in the previous section and <bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 1</italic></xref></bold> are primarily meant to give an intuitive and qualitative understanding of the two-domain model and rationalization of recent DMS measurements <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Leander et al.

In this section, we further establish a quantitative connection between the model and the induction curves of TetR variants, leveraging the recent success of linking sequence-level perturbations to system-level responses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Daber et al.

(2017)</xref>. An induction curve describes the in vivo expression level of the TetR-regulated gene as a function of inducer concentration.</p>
<p>As described in the last section, the intra-domain parameters (ɛ<sub>D</sub>, ɛ<sub>L</sub>) and inter-domain parameter (γ) of the two-domain model collectively determine the free energy landscape of TetR (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 1</italic></xref></bold>). Consequently, a degenerate relationship arises between combinations of parameter values and the induction level at a specific ligand concentration as measured in the DMS study. To tease apart the allosteric effects of different parameters, we aim to formulate their connection to the full induction curve, which is characterized by (1) the expression level of the TF-regulated gene without ligand (leakiness), (2) gene expression level at saturating ligand concentration (saturation) and (3) the ligand concentration required for half-maximal expression (EC<sub>50</sub>). As revealed in previous studies, these induction curve properties encode information for the key parameters of an allosteric regulation system, for example, the TF binding affinity to ligand and operator, equilibrium between different conformational states of the TF and the abundance of various essential molecules within the system. The establishment of a quantitative connection between the MWC model and the induction curve has yielded valuable insights into several allosteric systems <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Eaton (2022)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Daber et al. (2011)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Chure et al. (2019)</xref>. However, the analogous aspects within a multi-domain thermodynamic model for allostery require further investigation.</p>
<p>Inspired by the pioneering works on transcription with MWC models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Daber et al. (2011)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Chure et al. (2019)</xref>, we derived a quantitative relation between the gene expression level in cells and the three biophysical parameters of the two-domain model (<bold><xref rid="eqn1" ref-type="disp-formula"><italic>Equation 1</italic></xref></bold>). Briefly, the ratio of the expression level of a TF-regulated gene to that of an unregulated gene, termed fold change (F C) and bound between 0 and 1, is used to quantify gene expression. The gene expression level on the other hand, is assumed to be proportional to the probability that a promoter in the system is bound by RNA polymerase, p(RNAP). Thus, F C is evaluated as the ratio of p(RNAP) in the presence of the TF to that in the absence of the TF. Intuitively, p(RNAP) can be calculated based on the equilibria among different binding and conformational states of the TF (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 2</italic></xref></bold>—figure Supplement 1 and <bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 2</italic></xref></bold>—figure Supplement 2), which are determined by the allosteric properties (ɛ<sub>D</sub>, ɛ<sub>L</sub> and γ) and several other parameters. Therefore, F C can be expressed as a function of these parameters, which under the assumption that intra- and inter-domain energetics adopt typical values of several <italic>k</italic><sub>B</sub> <italic>T</italic>, is simplified to <bold><xref rid="eqn1" ref-type="disp-formula"><italic>Equation 1</italic></xref></bold>.

Here, <italic>R</italic><sup>∗</sup> is the rescaled TF copy number in the cell; <italic>c</italic> is ligand concentration, and <italic>K</italic> is the dissociation constant of ligand to the repressor with an active LBD. As we focus on understanding how sequence level perturbations are manifested in the allosteric properties of the protein (depicted by ɛ<sub>D</sub>, ɛ<sub>L</sub> and γ), the residues we choose for mutational study here are mostly not in direct contact with either the ligand or the operator (see supplementary file for more discussions). Thus, <italic>K</italic> and <italic>R</italic><sup>∗</sup>, which is determined by the TF copy number in the cell and the affinity of the operator to the repressor with an active DBD, are taken to be constants across mutations in all subsequent discussions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Chure et al. (2019)</xref>. Detailed derivations of <bold><xref rid="eqn1" ref-type="disp-formula"><italic>Equation 1</italic></xref></bold> are provided in the supplementary file.</p>
<p>Despite the considerable degeneracy in the activity (inducible and noninducible) within the parameter space of the two-domain model (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 1</italic></xref></bold>D), <bold><xref rid="eqn1" ref-type="disp-formula"><italic>Equation 1</italic></xref></bold> demonstrates that mutations affecting distinct biophysical parameters can be discerned based on their characteristic effects on the induction curve.</p>
<p>First, as ɛ<sub>L</sub> and γ have no effect on the leakiness of the induction curve, only mutations that modify ɛ<sub>D</sub> can lead to its changes (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 2</italic></xref></bold> and Supplementary file for additional discussions). In addition, these mutations also change the level of saturation (F C value where the induction curve plateaus at large <italic>c</italic>). Thus, dead mutations that disrupt allostery by decreasing ɛ<sub>D</sub> alone will uniquely feature a noticeably lower leakiness and a lower level of saturation compared with the WT (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 1</italic></xref></bold>D and <bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 2</italic></xref></bold>, see also Supplementary file and <bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 2</italic></xref></bold>—figure Supplement 3 for more discussions). Second, mutations that solely perturb the other intra-domain property ɛ<sub>L</sub>, a crucial determinant of TetR’s ligand detection limit, primarily shift the EC<sub>50</sub> of the induction curve (see <bold><xref rid="eqn1" ref-type="disp-formula"><italic>Equation 1</italic></xref></bold>). As ɛ<sub>L</sub> increases/decreases from the WT value, the induction curve is right/left shifted with leakiness and the level of saturation remaining unchanged (see the blue and red curves of <bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 2</italic></xref></bold>A). However, when ɛ<sub>L</sub> further increases, the induction curve loses the sigmoidal shape, with its sharply varying tail region being the characteristic of a dead mutation that disrupts allostery mainly by increasing ɛ<sub>L</sub> (purple curve of <bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 2</italic></xref></bold>A, see Supplementary file and <bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 2</italic></xref></bold>—figure Supplement 3 for more discussions).</p>
<p>Finally, in the high concentration limit, <bold><xref rid="eqn1" ref-type="disp-formula"><italic>Equation 1</italic></xref></bold> converges to a constant value (see Equation 2).
<disp-formula id="eqn2">
<graphic xlink:href="552196v3_eqn2.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
Hence, mutations affecting γ alone will tune the saturation of a sigmoidal induction curve, which increases/decreases as γ increases/decreases (see red and purple curves of <bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 2</italic></xref></bold>C). Therefore, in contrast to the two aforementioned scenarios, dead mutations that disrupt allostery through decreasing γ alone will feature a full sigmoidal induction curve with a low level of saturation and unchanged leakiness compared with the WT (with γ &gt; 0, see the purple curve of <bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 2</italic></xref></bold>C). Furthermore, as γ dictates the inter-domain cooperativity, it thereby controls the sign of the monotonicity of F C as a function of <italic>c</italic> (see Supplementary file for detailed proof). Specifically, when γ/0, there is negative/positive cooperativity between ligand and operator binding, and F C increases/decreases monotonically with <italic>c</italic> (see <bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 2</italic></xref></bold>C). When γ = 0, however, the bindings of ligand and operator become independent of each other, and <italic>c</italic> no longer affects F C (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 2</italic></xref></bold>—figure Supplement 3).</p>
<p>The distinctive roles of the three biophysical parameter on the induction curve as stipulated in <bold><xref rid="eqn1" ref-type="disp-formula"><italic>Equation 1</italic></xref></bold> could be understood in an intuitive manner as well. First, the value of ɛ<sub>D</sub> controls the intrinsic strength of binding of TetR to the operator, or the intrinsic difficulty for ligand to induce their separation. Therefore, it controls how tightly the downstream gene is regulated by TetR without ligands (reflected in leakiness) and affects the performance limit of ligands (reflected in saturation). Second, the value of ɛ<sub>L</sub> controls how favorable ligand binding is in free energy. When ɛ<sub>L</sub> increases, the binding of ligand at low concentrations become unfavorable, where the ligands cannot effectively bind to TetR to induce its separation from the operator. Therefore, the fold-change as a function of ligand concentration only starts to noticeably increase at higher ligand concentrations, resulting in larger EC<sub>50</sub>. Third, as discussed above, γ controls the level of anti-cooperativity between the ligand and operator binding of TetR, which is the basis of its allosteric regulation. In other words, γ controls how strongly ligand binding is incompatible with operator binding for TetR, hence it controls the performance limit of ligand (reflected in saturation).</p>
<p>Having identified the distinctive impacts of the different allosteric parameters of the two-domain model on the induction curve, as outlined in <bold><xref rid="eqn1" ref-type="disp-formula"><italic>Equation 1</italic></xref></bold>, we next apply the model to analyze actual experimental induction curves of TetR mutants. The analysis enables us to uncover the underlying biophysical factors contributing to diverse mutational effects. Additionally, it allows us to evaluate the model’s validity in capturing TetR allostery by assessing its accuracy in reproducing the experimental data.</p>

<title>Extensive induction curves fitting of TetR mutants</title>
<p>With the diagnostic tools established, we mapped mutants to the parameter space of the two-domain model through fitting of their induction curves. We choose 15 mutants for analysis in this section, which contain mutations that span different regions in the sequence and structure of TetR (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 3</italic></xref></bold>—figure Supplement 1 and <bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 3</italic></xref></bold>—figure Supplement 9).

Briefly, given ɛ<sub>D</sub> calculated in the first step, we select a set of ɛ<sub>L</sub> and γ values from physical ranges of the parameters, based on the probability of observing the induction curve with the parameter values using Monte Carlo sampling. The medians of the selected sets of ɛ<sub>L</sub> and γ values, which are known as posterior distributions, are reported as the inferred parameter values, and error bars show the 95% credible regions of the posterior distributions (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 3</italic></xref></bold>B and <bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 4</italic></xref></bold>—figure Supplement 2B).

<p>As shown in <bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 3</italic></xref></bold>A, the fitted curves accurately capture the induction data of all the mutants studied here, enabling the quantification of their biophysical parameters with little uncertainty (see <bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 3</italic></xref></bold>B and <bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 3</italic></xref></bold>—figure Supplement 10). These results support the general applicability of the two-domain model to describing TetR allostery, as these 15 mutants vary significantly in terms of location of mutations and phenotype. They are one to four mutations away from the WT, and the sites of mutations are distributed across LBD, DBD and the domain interface (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 3</italic></xref></bold>—figure Supplement 1). In terms of the phenotype, they fall into different classes as characterized by the F C value at <italic>c</italic> = 1000 nM (F C<sup>1000</sup>), including dead (F C<sup>1000</sup> &lt; 0.1), enhanced induction (F C<sup>1000</sup> &gt; F C<sup>1000</sup>) and neutral activity (the rest).</p>
<p>Besides inspecting the goodness of fit, a closer examination of the induction curves and the Bayesian inference results reveal additional features of the two-domain model of TetR allostery. First, the apparent binding affinity of TetR to the ligand (anhydrotetracycline; aTC) and operator (<italic>tet02</italic>) used in our experiments are estimated to be about 17.4 <italic>k</italic><sub>B</sub> <italic>T</italic> and 16.4 <italic>k</italic><sub>B</sub> <italic>T</italic>, respectively, based on the parameter values inferred for the WT (see Supplementary file for detailed calculations); these agree well with the range of reported experimental values <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Scholz et al. (2000)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Schubert et al. (2004)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Kędracka-Krok and Wasylewski (1999)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Kamionka et al. (2004)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bolintineanu et al. (2014)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Normanno et al. (2015)</xref>. Second, as shown in <bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 3</italic></xref></bold>B, the perturbations in ɛ<sub>D</sub> are generally small in magnitude (&lt; 1 <italic>k</italic><sub>B</sub> <italic>T</italic>) among the dead mutants, while substantially larger perturbations (up to ∼ 5 <italic>k</italic><sub>B</sub> <italic>T</italic>) are observed for ɛ<sub>L</sub> and γ. The latter observation is in line with the predictions of the model (see the previous section) that two types of qualitatively different induction curves are expected for partially dead mutants (see the first and second rows of <bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 3</italic></xref></bold>A). Specifically, the induction curve of P176N-I174K-F177S (PIF) loses the sigmoidal shape, with its sharply varying tail region suggesting a significant increase of ɛ<sub>L</sub>. This is confirmed by the parameter fitting result, which shows that the triple mutations of PIF, located in the core region of LBD (Supplementary file and <bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 3</italic></xref></bold>—figure Supplement 1), lead to the largest increase of ɛ<sub>L</sub> among all mutants (4.5 <italic>k</italic><sub>B</sub> <italic>T</italic> higher than the WT, see <bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 3</italic></xref></bold>B). The induction curves of the other four dead mutants (R49G, D53H, P105M and G143M), however, maintain the sigmoidal shape yet with low levels of saturation. As they all exhibit a higher ɛ<sub>D</sub> (leakiness) than the WT, the low levels of saturation have to result solely from weakened inter-domain couplings (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 3</italic></xref></bold>). In other words, these four dead mutations, located mostly at the domain interface (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 3</italic></xref></bold>—figure Supplement 1), disrupt allostery primarily through decreasing γ. Indeed, when the γ of these mutants is set to the WT value but keeping their respective ɛ<sub>D</sub> and ɛ<sub>L</sub> parameters unchanged, higher F C<sup>1000</sup> values than the WT are obtained instead (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 3</italic></xref></bold>—figure Supplement 7).</p>
<p>Despite the discussion of two limiting types of changes in the induction curves, it is interesting to observe in <bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 3</italic></xref></bold>B that the three biophysical parameters, especially ɛ<sub>L</sub> and γ, are often perturbed together in the mutants. Indeed, although the three parameters are theoretically independent of each other, at the structural level, it is less likely to have a scenario where a mutation perturbs inter-domain coupling (γ) but leaves intra-domain properties unchanged. Lastly, while quantification of G102D from its flat induction curve incurs large uncertainties, (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 2</italic></xref></bold>—figure Supplement 3), the diversities of the induction curves and the biophysical parameters of the G102D-rescuing mutants (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 3</italic></xref></bold>B) provide clear support for the qualitative anticipation from the previous section; i.e., rescuing mutations of a dead mutant may restore inducibility through different combinations of tuning ɛ<sub>D</sub>, ɛ<sub>L</sub> and γ. For example, while Y42M-I57N and K98Q both rescue G102D to achieve similar F C<sup>1000</sup>, they exert distinct influences on ɛ<sub>D</sub> and ɛ<sub>L</sub>, as reflected in the variations of leakiness and EC<sub>50</sub> between the corresponding induction curves. In another case, while the induction curves of G102D-T26A and G102D-L146A show comparable values of saturation and leakiness, their different EC<sub>50</sub> values suggest the different effects of the two rescuing mutations on ɛ<sub>L</sub>, further quantified by the inferred parameter values. The diverse mechanistic origins of the rescuing mutations revealed here provide a rational basis for the broad distributions of such mutations.

<title>Exploring epistasis between mutations</title>
<p>With the 15 mutants mapped to the parameter space of the two-domain model, we now explore the epistatic interactions between the relevant mutations. To do so, we start by assuming additivity in the perturbation of all three biophysical parameters (see <bold><xref rid="eqn4" ref-type="disp-formula"><italic>Equation 4</italic></xref></bold> and <bold><xref rid="eqn5" ref-type="disp-formula"><italic>Equation 5</italic></xref></bold>, where <italic>p</italic> represents any one of ɛ<sub>D</sub>, ɛ<sub>L</sub> and γ).

</disp-formula>
</p>
<disp-formula id="eqn5">
<graphic xlink:href="552196v3_eqn5.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
<p>We then evaluate how the induction curves generated by this additive model (α<sub>1,<italic>p</italic></sub> = α<sub>2,<italic>p</italic></sub> = 1) deviate from the corresponding experimental results, and the magnitude of deviation quantifies the significance of epistasis. Eight mutation combinations were chosen for the analysis, where we pair up C203V and Y132A, the two single mutations that enhance the level of induction relative to the WT, with mutations from different structural regions of TetR (see Supplementary file section 7 for more discussions).</p>
<p>Although predictions from the additive model are qualitatively correct for 5 of the 8 mutation combinations on phenotypic effects, none of them captures the corresponding induction curve accurately (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 4</italic></xref></bold>—figure Supplement 1). This again highlights the parameter space degeneracy of the phenotypes, and that mechanistic specificity is required of a model for making reliable predictions on combined mutants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Li and Lehner (2020)</xref>. For a deeper understanding of epistatic interactions between the mutations queried here, we next directly fit for the three biophysical parameters of the combined mutants using their induction curves, which are then compared with those obtained from the additive model.</p>
<p>As shown in <bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 4</italic></xref></bold>—figure Supplement 2A, the induction data of all eight combined mutants are well captured by the fitted curves, which reaffirms the applicability of the two-domain model. Interestingly, despite the discrepancy between the experimental induction curves and those predicted by the additive model, the fitted parameters of the combined mutants are comparable to those from the additive model in many cases (see <bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 4</italic></xref></bold>—figure Supplement 2B). In this regard, one noticeable example is the mutant C203V-G102D-L146A, for which the result of direct fitting is close to the additive model in terms of both ɛ<sub>L</sub> and γ (with a difference of ⩽ 0.5 <italic>k</italic><sub>B</sub> <italic>T</italic>), while they differ more in ɛ<sub>D</sub> (1.6 <italic>k</italic><sub>B</sub> <italic>T</italic>). Inspired by such observations, we then seek the minimal modifications to the additive model that can account for epistasis. As C203 is one of the most distant residues from DBD in TetR, we reason that its effect on ɛ<sub>D</sub> may get dominated by mutations much closer to the DNA binding residues like G102D and L146A (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 3</italic></xref></bold>—figure Supplement 1 and <bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 3</italic></xref></bold>—figure Supplement 9). Remarkably, when we quench C203V’s contribution to ɛ<sub>D</sub> in the additive model of C203V-G102D-L146A (α<sub>C203V,ɛ</sub> = 0, see <bold><xref rid="eqn4" ref-type="disp-formula"><italic>Equation 4</italic></xref></bold>), the predicted induction curve well recapitulates the experimental data (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 4</italic></xref></bold><italic>G</italic>). In another example, when C203V is combined with the triple mutations PIF, which are much closer to the DBD, the fitted parameters of the combined mutant also align well with the additive model except only for ɛ<sub>D</sub>. Here, quenching C203V’s contribution to ɛ<sub>D</sub> again leads to good agreement between the additive model and experiment in terms of the induction curve (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 4</italic></xref></bold>H).</p>
<p>The epistatic effects in other C203V-containing combined mutants can be largely accounted for by modifying the additive model following the same physical reasoning as above. For instance, mutation D53H is near the DNA-binding residues and located at the domain interface, which suggests its dominant role in defining the DBD energetics and inter-domain cooperativity when paired up with C203V <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Scholz et al. (2004)</xref>. Accordingly, quenching C203V’s effect on both ɛ<sub>D</sub> and γ in the additive model for mutant C203V-D53H leads to dramatic improvement in the induction curve prediction (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 4</italic></xref></bold>—figure Supplement 1F and <bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 4</italic></xref></bold>F). Along this line, success is also observed when accounting for the epistasis between C203V and R49G by the same approach (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 4</italic></xref></bold>E). These examples might also explain why C203V, although being able to enhance the induction of TetR, fails to rescue a range of dead mutations including R49A, D53V, G102D, N129D and G196D <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Leander et al. (2020)</xref>. More broadly, these observations together indicate that epistasis in combined mutants (e.g., those containing C203V) can be captured by the additive two-domain model with modifications based on physical reasoning.</p>
<p>The epistasis in combined mutants containing Y132A can be understood in a similar manner. Noticeably, the fitted parameter values of Y132A-C203V agree very well with the additive model for ɛ<sub>D</sub> and γ (within a difference of 0.4 <italic>k</italic><sub>B</sub> <italic>T</italic>), while they differ in ɛ<sub>L</sub> by 3.8 <italic>k</italic><sub>B</sub> <italic>T</italic>. Interestingly, such discrepancy in ɛ<sub>L</sub> values can be essentially resolved by quenching Y132A’s contribution in the additive model (reduced to 0.4 <italic>k</italic><sub>B</sub> <italic>T</italic>). This likely suggests that the effect of Y132A on ɛ<sub>L</sub> tends to be compromised when combined with other mutations that perturb ɛ<sub>L</sub>. Indeed, for most of the Y132A containing mutants investigated here (Y132A-C203V/PIF/R49G), the accuracy of induction curve prediction by the additive model improves greatly when α<sub>Y132A,ɛ</sub> is tuned down (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 4</italic></xref></bold>B − D, see Supplementary file for more discussions).</p>
<p>The only exception to this trend is the mutant Y132A-G102D-T26A, for which we observe strong epistasis between Y132A and the dead-rescue mutation pair G102D-T26A. Although both mutations Y132A and G102D-T26A enhance the allosteric response of TetR (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 3</italic></xref></bold>), their combined effects radically change the sign of cooperativity between the two domains (γ), turning the ligand (aTC) from an inducer into a corepressor (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 4</italic></xref></bold>A and <bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 4</italic></xref></bold>—figure Supplement 2B). Here, large disparity exists between the additive model and the direct fitting result in all three biophysical parameters, which cannot be explained by simple modifications of the additive model.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Allostery, a major regulatory mechanism in biology, has attracted intense research interest in the past few decades due to its complexity and implications in biomedicine and protein engineering. A central goal is to develop a quantitative understanding of the phenomena through a physical model that can be tested by comprehensive data. Along this line, one of us has in recent years advanced a function-centric approach to studying protein allostery with DMS, which provides a comprehensive and most direct test of our mechanistic understandings. Specifically, we have shown in an unbiased way that allostery hotspots and dead-rescue mutation pairs in four TetR family TFs are distributed across the protein structures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Leander et al. (2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">2022</xref>). This highlights that modifying the propagation of conformational distortions between the effector and active sites is not the only way to tune allosteric regulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Leander et al. (2020)</xref>.</p>
<p>The rich and surprising observations for the TetR family TFs call for a physical understanding of the underlying allostery mechanism, for which we resort to statistical thermodynamic models. Statistical thermodynamic models have played a central role in shaping our understanding of allostery <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Bacon (1965)</xref>; Koshland Jr et al. (1966). In particular, Chure et al. have developed the methodology of fitting the MWC model to the induction data of LacI repressors using Bayesian inference <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Chure et al. (2019)</xref>. This established the connection between sequence-level perturbations to system-level responses, which enables the exploration of mutational effects on transcription within the framework of biophysical models. However, as pointed out in several previous studies, the MWC model is not consistent with the observation that effector-bound TetR crystal structures are closer to the DNA-bound form compared to the apo crystal structures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Motlagh et al. (2014)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Reichheld et al. (2009)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Hilser et al. (2012)</xref>. Hence, it’s at least difficult to provide a complete picture of TetR allostery with the MWC model. The ensemble allosteric model (EAM) on the other hand, presents a more flexible and detailed domain-specific view of allostery, which can be applied to more complex allosteric systems (e.g., allostery with intrinsically disordered proteins) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Motlagh et al. (2014)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Hilser et al. (2012)</xref>.</p>
<p>Inspired by these pioneering developments and our DMS results, in this work, we propose a two-domain statistical thermodynamic model, the parameter-activity degeneracy of which readily elucidates the distributed allosteric network observed in the DMS result of TetR (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 1</italic></xref></bold>). On the other hand, the functional form derived in <bold><xref rid="eqn1" ref-type="disp-formula"><italic>Equation 1</italic></xref></bold> establishes the qualitative differences in the impacts of various model parameters on the characteristics of the induction curve (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 2</italic></xref></bold>); for example, dead mutations perturbing inter- and intra-domain properties are predicted to cause induction curves with and without a saturating plateau, which are both observed experimentally (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 3</italic></xref></bold>). Moreover, <bold><xref rid="eqn1" ref-type="disp-formula"><italic>Equation 1</italic></xref></bold> accurately captures the induction data of a diverse set of TetR mutants (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 3</italic></xref></bold>, <bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 3</italic></xref></bold>—figure Supplement 1 and <bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 4</italic></xref></bold>—figure Supplement 2) in a quantitative manner, enabling their mapping to the model parameter space with high precision. It’s noted that the homodimeric nature of TetR is ignored in the current two-domain model to minimize the number of parameters, and additional experimental data could necessitate a more complex model for TetR allostery in the future (see Supplementary file section 8 for more discussions).</p>
<p>The success of <bold><xref rid="eqn1" ref-type="disp-formula"><italic>Equation 1</italic></xref></bold> allows for a quantitative investigation of epistasis between the characterized mutations. In a previous study of another TF, LacI, using the MWC model, no epistasis was observed between mutations of ligand-binding and DNA-binding residues analyzed therein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Chure et al. (2019)</xref>. In the present analysis of TetR, epistasis is observed in all eight queried mutation combinations, which can be largely rationalized through physical reasoning. For example, our results intuitively indicate that the effect of a distant mutation like C203V on DBD energetics and inter-domain coupling tend to be dominated by mutations much closer to these regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and <bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 4</italic></xref></bold>—figure Supplement 1). Such phenomena suggest that these mutations affect allosteric regulation by influencing not only the relative populations of conformations in different ligation states, but also through shifting the dominant conformations themselves Zhang et al. (2020). On the other hand, epistasis involving Y132A is more complex. For instance, we observe that Y132A’s influence on ɛ<sub>L</sub> is diminished when paired up with other mutations in most cases. Further mechanistic understanding, likely from a biochemical perspective, is required to fully explain this phenomenon. Nonetheless, these observations provide a plausible explanation for why C203V and Y132A, although being able to enhance the induction response of TetR individually, could not rescue a range of dead mutations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Leander et al. (2020)</xref>.</p>
<p>Our results reveal additional insights into the nature of two-domain allostery as well. Although our model assumes no a <italic>priori</italic> correlation between the intra- and inter-domain properties of the TF, we find that they are always modified together by mutations (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 3</italic></xref></bold> and <bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 4</italic></xref></bold>—figure Supplement 2). This immediately points to the interconnectivity of allosteric networks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Takeuchi et al. (2019)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Reichheld et al. (2009)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Scholz et al. (2004)</xref>. That is, when a residue is involved in the conformational rearrangements induced by both effector and operator binding, it functions as a bridge through which the two events are coupled. Within such a conceptual framework, it is highly unlikely to observe a mutation that changes γ alone without perturbing the intra-domain energetics.</p>
<p>This point is explicitly illustrated in <bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 5</italic></xref></bold>, which summarizes the locations of all the characterized 23 mutants in the two-dimensional space of ɛ<sub>L</sub> and γ. Here, the color of the contour plot encodes the F C<sup>1000</sup> value calculated for each (ɛ<sub>L</sub>, γ) combination together with the WT ɛ<sub>D</sub> value, while the color of the specific mutant data points is based on the true F C<sup>1000</sup> value. Thus, the color of a data point reflects the ɛ<sub>D</sub> of the corresponding mutant relative to the WT; i.e., a brighter/darker color than the surrounding indicates that the mutant features a higher/lower ɛ<sub>D</sub> value than the WT. Since the variations of ɛ<sub>D</sub> among the investigated mutants are modest compared with ɛ<sub>L</sub> and γ (see <bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 3</italic></xref></bold>B), we’ll primarily focus on the latter two in the discussion. Evidently, mutants with the strongest allosteric responses feature small ɛ<sub>L</sub> and large γ, which correspond to the upper left region of <bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 5</italic></xref></bold>. Additional mutations in the background of these mutants lead to weaker allosteric response, moving the mutants to the darker regions of the plot. The interconnected nature of allosteric networks described by the two-domain model, however, dictates that such shifts would take place along the diagonal of the ɛ<sub>L</sub> -γ plane, which describe mutations that modify intra- and inter-domain properties simultaneously. This feature potentially offers a functional advantage of preventing mutants from regions of low allosteric response (corresponding to upper right and lower left of <bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 5</italic></xref></bold>), facilitating efficient adaptation to new effectors during evolution. In the future, it is of interest to examine whether such a negative correlation between ɛ<sub>L</sub> and γ is a generic feature of two-domain allostery.</p>

</fig>
<p>Our results establish the two-domain model as a flexible and quantitative platform for investigating TetR allostery, adding to the value of statistical thermodynamic models as advocated by the seminal works on MWC molecules <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Daber et al. (2011)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Chure et al. (2019)</xref>. We note, however, that the two-domain model is a more generic description of allostery compared with the MWC model.</p>
<p>First, although our model identifies the importance of intra-domain energetics in tuning the free energies of different TF states, it points out the more fundamental role of inter-domain coupling in defining allosteric response (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 2</italic></xref></bold> and Supplementary file). A large inter-domain coupling is assumed to be obligatory in the MWC model and required to create the two pre-existing conformations of different ligand and operator affinities in the first place. Various experimental studies as well as our own data reveal that the inter-domain coupling of TetR is amenable to tuning, especially by mutations of residues at the domain interface <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Reichheld et al. (2009)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Scholz et al. (2004)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Müller et al. (1995)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Hecht et al. (1993)</xref>. In some cases, even single mutations can reverse the sign of cooperativity between LBD and DBD, indicating that the dead mutational effects observed in the DMS experiments and elsewhere could well originate from diminishing γ. These considerations necessitate an explicit treatment of γ in a physical model of TetR allostery.</p>
<p>Second, the MWC model, when applied to two-domain systems, contains at least four biophysical parameters <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Daber et al. (2011)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Chure et al. (2019)</xref>, is thus more complex than our two-domain model, which requires only three. The simplicity of our model reduces its parameter space degeneracy, enabling high precision in fitting while being able to accurately describe a broad set of induction data. The three parameters also offer an interpretable mechanistic picture of TetR allostery in a physically transparent fashion.</p>
<p>We have focused our experimental and theoretical analyses on the TetR-family TFs, which represent important systems for building allosteric models, due to their broad involvement in many aspects of cell physiology <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Ramos et al. (2005)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Cuthbertson and Nodwell (2013)</xref>. Along this line, a natural extension of the current study is to use the two-domain model as a platform for comparing allostery in different TetR homologs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Leander et al. (2022)</xref>. For example, coupling the model with systematic dose-response study of hotspot mutations could reveal the roles of different allosteric hotspots (whether they dictate intra- or inter-domain properties or both). The similarity in key structural features among TetR homologs then enables the comparison of the nature of hotspots at similar structural locations. This could potentially lead to novel insights into the different roles that sequence and structure play in defining the allostery of a system, which is a fundamental question to address in rational engineering of allosteric proteins.</p>
<p>Although our two-domain model is inspired by and established with the data of TetR family TFs, the mechanistic and modelling insights gained here should be generally applicable to other allosteric systems sharing the two-domain architecture. This includes other transcription factors like catabolite activator protein (CAP), a homodimeric TF with a cyclic AMP (effector) binding domain and a DNA binding domain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Tzeng and Kalodimos (2012)</xref>; receptors like pentameric ligand-gated ion channels (pLGICs), which allosterically translate the binding of neurotransmitters to their extra-cellular domains into the activation of ionotropic pores located in their transmembrane domains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Sauguet et al. (2015)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Hu et al. (2020)</xref>; and allosteric enzymes like aspartate transcarbamoylase (AT-Case), in which binding of effector like ATP to the regulatory domain allosterically alters the catalytic activity of the functional domain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Velyvis et al. (2007)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Lipscomb and Kantrowitz (2012)</xref>.

<title>Library synthesis</title>
<p>A comprehensive single-mutant TetR library was generated by replacing wildtype residues at positions 2–207 of TetR to all other 19 canonical amino acids (3,914 total mutant sequences). Oligonucleotides encoding each single-point mutation were synthesized as single-stranded Oligo Pools from Twist Bioscience and organized into 6 subpools, spanning six segments of the <italic>tetRd</italic> gene, corresponding to residues 2–39, 40–77, 78–115, 116–153, 154–191, and 192–207 of TetR(B) respectively. Additional sequence diversity was observed in the library due to error rates in the synthesis of single-stranded Oligo Pools, leading to the downstream identification of some double and triple mutant TetR variants. Oligo pools were encoded as a concatemer of the forward priming sequence, a BasI restriction site (5<sup>′</sup>-GGTCTC), six-base upstream constant region, TetR mutant sequence, six-base downstream constant region, a BsaI site (5<sup>′</sup>-GAGACC), and the reverse priming sequence. Subpools were resuspended in double-distilled water (ddH<sub>2</sub> 0) to a final molal concentration of 25 ng/μL and amplified using primers specific to each oligonucleotide subpool with KAPA SYBR FAST qPCR (KAPA Biosystems; 1-ng template). A second PCR amplification was performed with KAPA HiFi (KAPA Biosystems; 1-μL qPCR template, 15 cycles maximum). We amplified corresponding regions of pSC101_TetR_specR with primers that linearized the backbone, added a BsaI restriction site, and removed the replaced wildtype sequence. Vector backbones were further digested with DpnI, BsaI, and Antarctic phosphatase before library assembly.</p>
<p>We assembled mutant libraries by combining the linearized sensor backbone with each oligo subpool at a molar ratio of 1:5 using Golden Gate Assembly Kit (New England Biolabs; 37 <sup>◦</sup>C for 5 min and 60 <sup>◦</sup>C for 5 min, repeated 30 times). Reactions were dialyzed with water on silica membranes (0.025-μm pores) for 1 h before transformed into DH10B cells (New England Biolabs). Library sizes of at least 100,000 colony-forming units (cfu) were considered successful. DH10B cells containing the reporter pColE1_sfGFP_RFP_kanR were transformed with extracted plasmids to obtain cultures of at least 100,000 cfu. Following co-transformation, the cultures for each subpool were stored as glycerol stocks and kept at -80 <sup>◦</sup>C.</p>

<title>Fluorescence-activated cell sorting</title>
<p>The subpool library cultures were seeded from glycerol stocks into 3 mL lysogeny broth (LB) containing 50 μg/mL kanamycin (kan) and 50 μg/mL spectinomycin (spec) and grown for 16 h at 37 <sup>◦</sup>C. Each culture was then back-diluted into two wells of a 96-well plate containing LB kan/spec media using a dilution factor of 1:50 and grown for a period of 5 hours at 37 <sup>◦</sup>C. Following incubation, each well containing saturated library culture was diluted 1:75 into 1× phosphate saline buffer (PBS), and fluorescence intensity was measured on a SH800S Cell Sorter (Sony). We first gated cells to remove debris and doublets and selected for variants constitutively expressing RFP. Using this filter, we then proceeded to draw an additional gate to select for mutants that displayed low fluorescence intensities in the absence of anhydrotetracycline (aTC). This gate allowed us to select for mutants which retained the ability to repress GFP expression in the presence of an inducer, using prior measurements of WT TetR(B) as a reference for selecting repression competent mutants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Leander et al.

<p>Following overnight growth, each culture was back diluted into two wells of a 96-well plate containing LB kan/spec media using a 1:50 dilution factor.

Cells were then incubated for another 4-hour growth period at 37 <sup>◦</sup>C before being diluted into 1x PBS using a dilution factor of 1:75, and fluorescence intensity was measured on a SH800S Cell Sorter.</p>
<p>We first gated cells to remove debris and doublets and selected for variants constitutively expressing RFP before obtaining the distribution of fluorescence intensities (FITC-A) across the uninduced and induced populations of each of the 6 subpools (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 3</italic></xref></bold>—figure Supplement 8). Using the uninduced control population of each subpool as a reference, gates were drawn to capture mutants which displayed no response to the presence of aTC in the induced populations. Using these gates, 500,000 events were sorted from the induced populations of each subpool and cells were subsequently recovered at 37 <sup>◦</sup>C using 5 mL of LB media before being plated onto LB agar plates containing 50 μg/mL kan and spec.</p>

<title>Clonal screening of dead mutants</title>
<p>To screen for functionally deficient variants of TetR, 100 individual colonies were picked from each subpool and grown to saturation in a 96-well plate for 6 hours. Saturated cultures were then diluted 1:50 in LB-kan/spec media and grown in the presence and absence of 1 μM aTC for 6 hours before OD600 and GFP fluorescence (Gain: 40; Excitation: 488/20; Emission: 525/20) were read on a multiplate reader (Synergy HTX, BioTek). Fluorescence was normalized to OD600, and the fold inductions of each clone were calculated by dividing its normalized fluorescence in the presence of inducer by the normalized fluorescence in the absence of inducer. The fold-induction of WT TetR was tested in parallel with these screens to serve as a benchmark for function, and clones which displayed &lt; 50% activity to WT were replated and validated in triplicate before being sent for sanger sequencing (Functional Biosciences).</p>

<title>aTC dose response measurements</title>
<p>TetR mutants identified during clonal screening were reinoculated into 3 mL of LB Kan/Spec media and grown overnight. After an overnight growth period, each culture was added to 4 rows of 12 wells in a 96-well plate containing LB Kan/Spec media using a dilution factor of 1:50. Each mutant was tested across 12 different concentrations of aTC in quadruplicate fashion, with each row having an identical concentration gradient across the 12 wells. The aTC concentration gradient across the 12 wells were 0 nM, 10 nM, 20 nM, 40 nM, 60 nM, 80 nM, 100 nM, 150 nM, 250 nM, 500 nM, 750 nM, and 1μM aTC.</p>
<p>Following reinoculation into 96-well plates, selected mutants were placed on a plate shaker set to 900 RPM and incubated at 37 <sup>◦</sup>C for 5 hours. Following this 5-hour growth period, the plates were removed from the plate shaker and the OD600 and GFP fluorescence (Gain: 40; Excitation: 488/20; Emission: 525/20) of each well was read using a multiplate reader (Synergy HTX, BioTek). Fluorescence was normalized to OD600 for each well. The normalized fluorescence at each concentration was measured for 4 replicates of each mutant (unless otherwise stated). The fluorescence of GFP reporter-only control (no TetR), grown under identical conditions, was measured in the same way. This reporter-only control served as an upper bound to the fluorescence that could be measured in the experiment and was accompanied by a WT TetR-GFP reporter control, used to certify the precision of measurements made at different times.</p>

<title>Synthesis of combined TetR mutants</title>
<p>To assess the predictive capability of the additive model, eight combined mutants were selected to undergo aTC dose response characterization. These combined mutants were synthesized using clonal DNA fragments from Twist Biosciences coding for the amino acid sequence of each of the selected combined mutants. The gene fragments were individually cloned into sensor plasmid backbones identical to those used in the previous identification of non-functional TetR(B) mutants following the manufacturers protocol for Gibson Assembly (New England Biolabs). The newly constructed plasmids carrying each of the combined mutants were then transformed into E. coli (DH10B) cells containing a GFP reporter plasmid identical to that used in the previous characterization of non-functional TetR(B) mutants. After a 1-hour recovery period, 100 μL of recovered cells were plated onto LB kan/spec agar plates for each of the combination mutants and incubated for 16 hours at 37 <sup>◦</sup>C.</p>
<p>Following overnight growth, individual colonies were picked and inoculated into 3 mL of LB kan/spec media to be grown overnight at 37 <sup>◦</sup>C. Following overnight growth, samples from each culture were submitted for sanger sequencing to confirm the identity of each of the synthesized combined mutants. Following sequence verification, the aTC dose-response behavior of each combined mutant was characterized using an experimental setup consistent with dose-response measurements made for the previously identified TetR(B) mutants.</p>

<title>Model parameter estimation</title>
<p>As described above, the estimation of the three biophysical parameters (ɛ<sub>D</sub>, ɛ<sub>L</sub> and γ) for each mutant is divided into two steps. Firstly, as ɛ<sub>L</sub> and γ do not affect F C at <italic>c</italic> = 0 (<bold><xref rid="eqn1" ref-type="disp-formula"><italic>Equation 1</italic></xref></bold>), we directly calculate the value of ɛ<sub>D</sub> from the leakiness of an induction curve, which is measured with high precision in our experiments. With the calculated ɛ<sub>D</sub> (ɛ<sub>D</sub> <sup>w<italic>T</italic></sup> is set to 0 as reference), we then fit the full induction curve to obtain the values of ɛ<sub>L</sub> and γ using the method of Bayesian inference. Here, we first construct the statistical model that describes the data generating process based on <bold><xref rid="eqn1" ref-type="disp-formula"><italic>Equation 1</italic></xref></bold>, and specify the prior distributions of the relevant parameters. This enables the derivation of the conditional probability of the parameter values of a mutant given its induction data, known as the posterior distribution. The posterior distribution is then sampled using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), from which we infer the values of ɛ<sub>L</sub> and γ directly. The validity of the statistical model and computational algorithm is fully tested with several metrics, and all details regarding the parameter estimation process briefed here are provided in the Supplementary file.</p>

The four colored curves show that a flat induction curve can result from tuning each one of the three main biophysical parameters of the two-domain model alone (by decreasing ɛ<sub>D</sub> or increasing ɛ<sub>L</sub> from the WT value, or by setting γ to 0). The white points show the experimental induction data for the mutant G102D (measurements of 4 biological replicates at each ligand concentration). Note that the colored curves in the figure are generated for better visualization of the model parameters’ effect on the induction curve and not to be compared with the experimental data of G102D.

Now the authors develop a two-domain thermodynamic model for TetR that explains these compelling data.

<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The only minor weakness I found was that I still don’t have a better sense into (a) intuition and (b) mathematical derivation of Equation 1, which is so central to the work. I would recommend that the authors provide this early on in the main text.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for the suggestion. The full mathematical derivation of Equation 1 is given in the first section of the supplementary file. Given the length of the derivation, we think it’s better to keep it in the supplementary file rather than the main text. In the main text, the first subsection (overview of the two-domain thermodynamic model of allostery) of the Results section and the paragraph right before Equation 1 are meant for providing intuitive understandings of the two-domain model and the derivation of Equation 1, respectively.</p>
<p>We would also like to point the reviewer to Figure 2-figure supplement 2 and Equations (12) to (18) in the supplementary file for an alternative derivation. They show that the equilibria among all molecular species containing the operator are dictated by the binding free energies, the ligand concentration, and the allosteric parameters. The probability of an unbound operator (proportional to the probability that the promoter is bound by a RNA polymerase, or the gene expression level) can thus be calculated using Equation (12), which then leads to main text Equation 1 following the derivation given there.</p>
<p>Additionally, we’ve added a paragraph to the main text (line 248-260) to aid an intuitive understanding of Equation 1.</p>
<p>“The distinctive roles of the three biophysical parameter on the induction curve as stipulated in Equation 1 could be understood in an intuitive manner as well. First, the value of εD controls the intrinsic strength of binding of TetR to the operator, or the intrinsic difficulty for ligand to induce their separation. Therefore, it controls how tightly the downstream gene is regulated by TetR without ligands (reflected in leakiness) and affects the performance limit of ligands (reflected in saturation). Second, the value of εL controls how favorable ligand binding is in free energy. When εL increases, the binding of ligand at low concentrations become unfavorable, where the ligands cannot effectively bind to TetR to induce its separation from the operator. Therefore, the fold-change as a function of ligand concentration only starts to noticeably increase at higher ligand concentrations, resulting in larger EC50. Third, as discussed above, γ controls the level of anti-cooperativity between the ligand and operator binding of TetR, which is the basis of its allosteric regulation. In other words, γ controls how strongly ligand binding is incompatible with operator binding for TetR, hence it controls the performance limit of ligand (reflected in saturation).”</p>
<p>We hope that the reviewer will find this explanation helpful.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Allosteric regulations are complicated in multi-domain proteins and many large-scale mutational data cannot be explained by current theoretical models, especially for those that are neither in the functional/allosteric sites nor on the allosteric pathways. This work provides a statistical thermodynamic model for a two-domain protein, in which one domain contains an effector binding site and the other domain contains a functional site. The authors build the model to explain the mutational experimental data of TetR, a transcriptional repress protein that contains a ligand and a DNA-binding domain. They incorporate three basic parameters, the energy change of the ligand and DNA binding domains before and after binding, and the coupling between the two domains to explain the free energy landscape of TetR’s conformational and binding states. They go further to quantitatively explain the in vivo expression level of the TetR-regulated gene by fitting into the induction curves of TetR mutants. The effects of most of the mutants studied could be well explained by the model. This approach can be extended to understand the allosteric regulation of other two-domain proteins, especially to explain the effects of widespread mutants not on the allosteric pathways. Strengths: The effects of mutations that are neither in the functional or allosteric sites nor in the allosteric pathways are difficult to explain and quantify. This work develops a statistical thermodynamic model to explain these complicated effects. For simple two-domain proteins, the model is quite clean and theoretically solid. For the real TetR protein that forms a dimeric structure containing two chains with each of them composed of two domains, the model can explain many of the experimental observations. The model separates intra and inter-domain influences that provide a novel angle to analyse allosteric effects in multi-domain proteins.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for the supportive comments.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>As mentioned above, the TetR protein is not a simple two-main protein, but forms a dimeric structure in which the DNA binding domain in each chain forms contacts with the ligand-binding domain in the other chain. In addition, the two ligand-binding domains have strong interactions. Without considering these interactions, especially those mutants that are on these interfaces, the model may be oversimplified for TetR.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for this valid concern and acknowledge that TetR is a homodimer. However, we’ve deliberately chosen to simplify this complexity in our model for the following reasons.</p>
<p>(1) In this work, we aim to build a minimalist model for two-domain allostery withonly the most essential parameters for capturing experimental data. The simplicity of the model helps promote its mechanistic clarity and potential transferability to other allosteric systems.</p>
<p>(2) Fewer parameters are needed in a simpler model. Our two-domain modelcurrently uses only three biophysical parameters, which are all demonstrated to have distinct influences on the induction curve (see the main text section “System-level ramifications of the two-domain model”). This enables the inference of parameters with high precision for the mutants, and the quantification of the most essential mechanistic effects of their mutations, provided that the model is shown to accurately recapitulate the comprehensive dataset. Thus, we found it was unnecessary to add another parameter for explicitly describing inter-chain coupling, which would likely incur uncertainty in the inference of parameters due to the redundancy of their effects on induction data, and prevent the model from making faithful predictions.</p>
<p>(3) From a more biological point of view, TetR is an obligate dimer, meaning thatthe two chains must synchronize for function, supporting the two-domain simplification of TetR for binding concerns.</p>
<p>Additionally, as shown in the subsection “Inclusion of single-ligand-bound state of repressor” of section 1 of the supplementary file, incorporating the dimeric nature of TetR in our model by allowing partial ligand binding does not change the functional form of main text equation 1 in any practical sense. Therefore, considering all the factors stated above, we think that increasing the complexity of the two-domain model will only be necessary if additional data emerge to suggest the limitation of our model.</p>

<p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>This is an excellent work. I have only one suggestion for the authors. Interestingly, the authors also note that the epistatic interactions that they obtain are consistent with the structural features of the protein, which is not surprising. Within this framework, have the authors considered rescue mutations? Please see for example PMID: 18195360 and PMID: 15683227. If I understand right, this might further extend the applicability of their model. If so, the authors may want to add a comment to that effect.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for the supportive comments and for pointing us to the useful references. We have added some comments to the main text regarding this point in line 332-336: “The diverse mechanistic origins of the rescuing mutations revealed here provide a rational basis for the broad distributions of such mutations. Integrating such thermodynamic analysis with structural and dynamic assessment of allosteric proteins for efficient and quantitative rescuing mutation design could present an interesting avenue for future research, particularly in the context of biomedical applications (PMID: 18195360, PMID: 15683227).”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>The authors should try to build a more realistic dimeric model for TetR to see if it could better explain experimental data. If it were too complicated for a revision, more discussions on the weakness of the current model should be given.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for this valid concern and for the suggestion. The reasons for refraining from increasing the complexity of the model are fully discussed in our response to the reviewer’s public review given above. Primarily, we think that the value of a simple physical model is two-fold (e.g., the paradigm Ising model in statistical physics and the classic MWC model), first, its mechanistic clarity and potential transferability makes it a useful conceptual framework for understanding complex systems and establishing universal rules by comparing seemingly unrelated phenomena; second, it provides useful insights and design principles of specific systems if it can quantitatively capture the corresponding experimental data. Thus, given the current experimental data set, we believe it is justified to keep the two-domain model in its current form, while additional experimental data could necessitate a more complex model for TetR allostery in the future. Relevant discussions are added to the main text (line 443-446) and section 8 of the supplementary file.</p>
<p>“It’s noted that the homodimeric nature of TetR is ignored in the current two-domain model to minimize the number of parameters, and additional experimental data could necessitate a more complex model for TetR allostery in the future (see supplementary file section 8 for more discussions).”</p>

<p>(2) The criteria for the selection of mutants for analysis should be clearly given. Apart from deleting mutants that are in direct contact with the ligand of DNA, how many mutants are left, and how far are they are from the two sites? In line 257, what are the criteria for selecting these 15 mutants? Similarly, in line 332, what are the criteria for selecting these 8 mutants?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for this comment. The data selection criteria are now added in section 7 of the supplementary file. The distances to the DNA operator and ligand of the 21 residues under mutational study are now added in Table 1 (Figure 3-figure supplement 9). The added materials are referenced in the main text where relevant.</p>
<p>“7. Mutation selection for two-domain model analysis</p>
<p>In this work, there are 24 mutants studied in total including the WT, and they contain mutations at 21 WT residues. We did not perform model parameter inference for the mutant G102D because of its flat induction curve (see the second subsection of section 2 and main text Figure 2—figure Supplement 3). Therefore, there are 23 mutants analyzed in main text Figure 5.</p>
<p>Measuring the induction curve of a mutant involves a significant amount of experimental effort, which therefore is hard to be extended to a large number of mutants. Nonetheless, we aim to compose a set of comprehensive induction data here for validating our two-domain model for TetR allostery. To this end, we picked 15 individual mutants in the first round of induction curve measurements, which contains mutations spanning different regions in the sequence and structure of TetR (main text Figure 3—figure Supplement 1). Such broad distribution of mutations across LBD, DBD and the domain interface could potentially lead to diverse induction curve shapes and mutant phenotypes for validating the two-domain model. Indeed, as discussed in the main text section &quot;Extensive induction curves fitting of TetR mutants&quot;, the diverse effects on induction curve from mutations perturbing different allosteric parameters predicted by the model, are successfully observed in these 15 experimental induction curves. Additionally, 5 of the 15 mutants contain a dead-rescue mutation pair, which helps us validate the model prediction that a dead mutation could be rescued by rescuing mutations that perturb the allosteric parameters in various ways.</p>
<p>Eight mutation combinations were chosen for the second round of induction curve measurement for studying epistasis, where we paired up C203V and Y132A with mutations from different regions of the TetR structure. Such choice is largely based on two considerations. 1. As both C203V and Y132A greatly enhance the allosteric response of TetR, we want to probe why they cannot rescue a range of dead mutations as observed previously (PMID: 32999067). 2. C203V and Y132A are the only two mutants that show enhanced allosteric response in the first round of analysis. Combining detrimental mutations of allostery in a combined mutant could potentially lead to near flat induction curve, which is less useful for inference (see the second subsection of section 2).”</p>

<p>Since the number of hotspots identified by DMS is not very large, why not analyze them all?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for this comment. There are 41 hotspot residues in TetR
(PMID: 36226916), which have 41*19=779 possible single mutations. It’s unfeasible to perform induction curve measurements for all of these 779 mutants in our current experiment. However, we agree that it would be helpful if we can obtain such a dataset in an efficient way.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>In line 257, there are 15 mutants mentioned, while in Figure 5, there are 23 mutants mentioned, in Figure 3-figure supplement 1, there are 21 mutants mentioned, and in line 226 of the supplementary file, there are 24 mutants mentioned, which is very confusing. Therefore, the data selection criteria used in this article should be given.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for this comment. The data selection criteria are now given in section 7 of the supplementary file, which should clarify this confusion.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) In Figure 4 of the Exploring epistasis between mutations section, the 6 weights of the additive models corresponding to each mutation combination are different. On one hand, it seems that there are no universal laws in these experimental data. On the other hand, unique parameters of a single mutation combination were not validated in other mutation combinations, which somewhat weakened the conclusions about the potential physical significance of these additive weights.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for this comment. We admit that a quantitative universal law for tuning the 6 weights of the additive model does not manifest in our data, which indicates the mutation-specific nature of epistatic interactions in TetR as hinted in the different rescuing mutation distributions of different dead mutations (PMCID: PMC7568325). However, clear common trends in the weight tuning of combined mutants that contain common mutations do emerge, which comply with the structural features of the protein and provide explanations as to why C203V and Y132A don’t rescue a range of dead mutations (main text section “Exploring epistasis between mutations”). Additionally, the lack of a quantitative universal rule for tuning the 6 weights in our simple model doesn’t exclude the possibility of the existence of universal law for epistasis in TetR in another functional form, a point that could be explored in the future with more extensive joint experimental and computational investigations.</p>

(27) in the supplementary file, the prior of γ is chosen to serve as a soft constraint on its possible values based on the consideration that 1. inter-domain energetics for a TetR-like protein should be on the order of a few kBT; and 2. the prior distribution should reflect the experimental observation in the literature that γ has a small probability of adopting negative values upon mutations. Given our thorough validation of the statistical model and computational algorithm (see section 3 of the supplementary file), and the high precision in the parameter fitting results using experimental data (Figure 3 and Figure 4-figure supplement 2), we conclude that 1. the physical range of parameters encoded in their chosen prior distributions agrees well with the value reflected in the experimental data; 2. the inference results are predominantly informed by the data. Thus, changing the mean of the prior distribution of γ should not affect the inference results significantly given that it remains in the physical range.</p>
<p>This point is explicitly shown in the added Table 2 (Figure 3-figure supplement 10), where we compare the current Bayesian inference results with those obtained after increasing the standard deviation of the Gaussian prior of γ from 2.5 to 5 kBT. As shown in the table, most inference results stay virtually unchanged at the use of this less informative prior, which confirms that they are predominantly informed by the data. The only exceptions are the slight increase of the inferred γ values for C203V, C203V-Y132A and C203V-G102D-L146A, reflecting the intrinsic difficulty of precise inference of large γ values with our model, as is already discussed in the second subsection of section 3 of the supplementary file. However, such observations comply with the common trend of epistatic interactions involving C203V presented in the main text and don’t compromise the ability of our model to accurately capture the induction curves of mutants. Relevant discussions are now added to the second subsection of section 3 of the supplementary file (line 368-385).</p>
<p>“In our experimental dataset, such inference difficulty is only observed in the case of C203V, Y132A-C203V and C203V-G102D-L146A due to their large γ and γ + εL values (see main text Figure 3, Figure 3—figure Supplement 10 and Figure 4). As shown in main text Figure 3—figure Supplement 10, the inference results for the other 20 mutants stay highly precise and virtually unchanged after increasing the standard deviation of the Gaussian prior of γ (gstdγ ) from 2.5 to 5 kBT. This demonstrates that the inference results for these mutants are strongly informed by the induction data and there is no difficulty in the precise inference of the parameter values. On the other hand, the inferred γ values (especially the upper bound of the 95% credible region) for C203V, Y132A-C203V and C203V-G102D-L146A increased with gstdγ . This is because the induction curves in these cases are not sensitive to the value of γ given that it’s large enough as discussed above. Hence, when unphysically large γ values are permitted by the prior distribution, they could enter the posterior distribution as well. Such difficulty in the precise inference of γ values for these three mutants however, doesn’t compromise the ability of our model in accurately capturing the comprehensive set of induction data (see part iv below). Additionally, the increase of the inferred γ value of C203V at the use of larger gstdγ complies with the results presented in main text Figure 4, which show that the effect of C203V on γ tends to be compromised when combined with mutations closer to the domain interface.&quot;</p>
