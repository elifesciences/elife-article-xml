<title>Abstract</title><p>When observing others’ behaviors, we continuously integrate their movements with the corresponding sounds to enhance perception and develop adaptive responses. However, how the human brain integrates these complex audiovisual cues based on their natural temporal correspondence remains unclear. Using electroencephalogram (EEG), we demonstrated that rhythmic cortical activity tracked the hierarchical rhythmic structures in audiovisually congruent human walking movements and footstep sounds. Remarkably, the cortical tracking effects exhibit distinct multisensory integration modes at two temporal scales: an additive mode in a lower-order, narrower temporal integration window (step-cycle) and a super-additive enhancement in a higher-order, broader temporal window (gait-cycle). Furthermore, while neural responses at the lower-order timescale reflect a domain-general audiovisual integration process, cortical tracking at the higher-order timescale is exclusively engaged in the integration of biological motion cues. In addition, only this higher-order, domain-specific cortical tracking effect correlates with individuals’ autistic traits, highlighting its potential as a neural marker for autism spectrum disorder. These findings unveil the multifaceted mechanism whereby rhythmic cortical activity supports the multisensory integration of human motion, shedding light on how neural coding of hierarchical temporal structures orchestrates the processing of complex, natural stimuli across multiple timescales.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The perception of biological motion (BM), the movements of living creatures, is a fundamental ability of the human visual system. Extensive evidence shows that humans can readily perceive BM from a visual display depicting just a handful of light dots attached to the head and major joints of a moving person (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Blake &amp; Shiffrar, 2007</xref>). Nevertheless, in real life, BM perception often occurs in multisensory contexts. For instance, one may simultaneously hear footstep sounds while seeing others walking. The integration of these visual and auditory BM cues facilitates the detection, discrimination, and attentional processing of BM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Mendonça et al., 2011</xref>; Shen, Lu, Wang, et al., 2023; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Thomas &amp; Shiffrar, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">van der Zwan et al., 2009</xref>). Notably, such benefits are diminished when the visual BM is deprived of characteristic kinematic cues but not low-level motion attributes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Brooks et al., 2007</xref>; Shen, Lu, Wang, et al., 2023; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Thomas &amp; Shiffrar, 2010</xref>), and the temporal windows of perceptual audiovisual synchrony are different between BM and non-BM stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Arrighi et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Saygin et al., 2008</xref>), highlighting the specificity of audiovisual BM processing. This specificity may relate to the evolutionary significance of BM and its pivotal role in social situations. In particular, integrating multisensory BM cues is foundational for perceiving and attending to other people and developing further social interaction. Such ability is usually compromised in people with social deficits, such as individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Falck-Ytter et al., 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Feldman et al., 2018</xref>). These findings underline the unique contribution of multisensory BM processing to human perception and social cognition. However, despite the behavioral evidence, the neural coding of audiovisual BM cues and its possible link with individuals’ social cognitive capability remains largely unexplored.</p>
<p>An intrinsic property of human movements (such as walking and running) is that they are rhythmic and accompanied by frequency-congruent sounds. The audiovisual integration (AVI) of such rhythmic stimuli may involve a process that brain activity aligning with and tracking external rhythms, revealed by increased power or phase coherence of neural oscillations at corresponding frequencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bauer et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Ding et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Obleser &amp; Kayser, 2019</xref>). Studies based on simple or discrete stimuli show that temporal congruency in auditory and visual rhythms significantly enhances the cortical tracking of rhythmic stimulations in both modalities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Covic et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Keitel &amp; Müller, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Nozaradan et al., 2012b</xref>). Unlike these stimuli, BM conveys complex hierarchical rhythmic structures corresponding to integration windows at multiple temporal scales. For example, the human locomotion movement has a narrower integration window consisting of each step (i.e., step cycle) and a broader integration window incorporating the opponent motion of the two feet (i.e., gait cycle). A recent study suggests that neural tracking of these nested kinematic structures contributes to the spatiotemporal integration of visual BM cues in different manners (Shen, Lu, Yuan, et al., 2023). However, it remains open whether and how the cortical tracking of hierarchical rhythmic structures underpins the AVI of BM information.</p>
<p>To tackle this issue, we recorded electroencephalogram (EEG) signals from participants who viewed rhythmic point-light walkers or/and listened to the corresponding footstep sounds under visual (V), auditory (A), and audiovisual (AV) conditions in Experiments 1a &amp; 1b (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). An enhanced cortical tracking effect in the AV condition compared to each unisensory condition will indicate significant multisensory gains. Moreover, we adopted an additive model to classify multisensory integration based on the AV vs A+V comparison. This model assumes independence between inputs from each sensory modality and distinguishes among sub-additive (AV &lt; A+V), additive (AV = A+V), and super-additive (AV &gt; A+V) response modes (see a review by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Stevenson et al., 2014</xref>). The additive mode represents a linear combination between two modalities. In contrast, the super-additive and sub-additive modes indicate non-linear interaction processing, either with potentiated neural activation to facilitate the perception or detection of near-threshold signals (super-additive) or a deactivation mechanism to minimize the processing of redundant information cross-modally (sub-additive) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Laurienti et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Metzger et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Stanford et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Wright et al., 2003</xref>). Distinguishing among these integration modes may help elucidate the neural mechanism underlying AVI in specific contexts.</p>

The color of the visual stimuli changed one or two times within 6 s in the catch trials but did not change in the experimental trials. Participants were required to report the number of changes when the point-light stimulus was replaced by a red fixation. In Experiment 1, participants viewed rhythmic point-light walkers or/and listened to the corresponding footstep sounds under visual (V), auditory (A), and audiovisual (AV) conditions. The visual stimulus was the BM sequence in the V and AV conditions but a static frame from the sequence in the A condition. Experiment 2 included only the AV condition with different stimulus orientations (upright vs. inverted) and audiovisual congruency (congruent vs. incongruent).</p></caption>

</fig>
<p>Experiment 2 examined to what extent the AVI effect was specific to the multisensory processing of BM by using non-BM (inverted visual stimuli) as a control. Inversion disrupts the unique, gravity-compatible kinematic features of BM but not the rhythmic signals generated by low-level motion cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Ma et al., 2022</xref>; Shen, Lu, Yuan, et al., 2023; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Simion et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Troje &amp; Westhoff, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Wang et al., 2022</xref>), thus is expected to interfere with the BM-specific neural processing. Participants perceived visual BM stimuli accompanied by temporally congruent or incongruent BM sounds.</p>
<p>Comparing the congruency effect in neural responses between the upright and inverted conditions allowed us to verify whether the AVI of BM involves a mechanism distinct from that underlies the AVI of non-BM. In addition, we further explored the possible linkage between the BM-specific neural tracking effect and observers’ autistic traits. Previous behavioral studies found reduced orienting to audiovisually synchronized BM stimuli in ASD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Falck-Ytter et al., 2018</xref>). Since individuals with varying social cognitive abilities lie on a continuum extending from clinical to nonclinical populations with different levels of autistic traits, we investigated whether cortical tracking of audiovisual BM correlates with individuals’ autistic traits, as measured by the Autism-Spectrum Quotient (AQ) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Baron-Cohen et al., 2001</xref>).</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>In all experiments, 17%–23% of the trials were randomly selected as catch trials, in which the color of the walker changed one or two times throughout the trial, and there was no color change in other trials. Participants were required to detect the color change of visual stimuli (0-2 times during one trial) to maintain attention. Behavioral analysis on all trials showed that their performances for the task were generally high and equally well in all conditions of Experiment 1a (mean accuracy &gt; 98%; <italic>F</italic> (2, 46) = 0.814, <italic>p</italic> = .450, <italic>ƞ</italic><sub><italic>p</italic></sub><sup>2</sup> = 0.034), Experiment 1b (mean accuracy &gt; 98%; <italic>F</italic> (2, 46) = 0.615, <italic>p</italic> = .545, <italic>ƞ</italic><sub><italic>p</italic></sub><sup>2</sup> = 0.026), and Experiment 2 (mean accuracy &gt; 98%; <italic>F</italic> (3, 69) = 0.493, <italic>p</italic> = .688, <italic>ƞ</italic><sub><italic>p</italic></sub><sup>2</sup> = 0.021), indicating comparable attention state across conditions. The catch trials were excluded from the following EEG analysis.</p>

<title>Cortical tracking of rhythmic structures in audiovisual BM reveals AVI</title>
<sec id="s2a1">
<title>Experiment 1a</title>
<p>In Experiment 1a, we examined the cortical tracking of rhythmic BM information under V, A, and AV conditions (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>). We were interested in two critical rhythmic structures in the walking motion sequence, i.e., the gait cycle and the step cycle (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref><bold> &amp; 1b</bold>). During walking, each step of the left or right foot occurs alternatively to form a step cycle, and the antiphase oscillations of limbs during two steps characterize a gait cycle (Shen, Lu, Yuan, et al., 2023). In Experiment 1a, the frequency of a full gait cycle is 1 Hz, and the step-cycle frequency is 2 Hz. The strength of the cortical tracking effect was quantified by the amplitude peaks emerging from the EEG spectra at these frequencies.</p>
<p>As shown in the grand average amplitude spectra (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>), both the responses in three conditions showed clear peaks at step-cycle frequency (2 Hz; V: <italic>t</italic> (23) = 6.963, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001; A: <italic>t</italic> (23) = 6.073, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001; AV: <italic>t</italic> (23) = 7.054, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001; FDR corrected). In contrast, at gait-cycle frequency (1 Hz), only the response to AV stimulation showed significant peaks (V: t (23) = -2.072, <italic>p</italic> = 0.975; A: t (23) = -0.054, <italic>p</italic> = 0.521; AV: t (23) = 4.059, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001; FDR corrected). Besides, we also observed significant peaks at 4 Hz in all three conditions (<italic>p</italic>s &lt; 0.001, FDR corrected), which showed a similar audiovisual integration mode as 2 Hz (see more details in Supplementary Information).</p>

<p>Furthermore, we directly compared the cortical tracking effects between different conditions via a two-tailed paired t-test. At both 1 Hz (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref>) and 2 Hz (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref>), the amplitude in the AV condition was greater than that in the V condition (1 Hz: <italic>t</italic> (23) = 4.664, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001, Cohen’s <italic>d</italic> = 0.952; 2 Hz: <italic>t</italic> (23) = 5.132, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001, Cohen’s <italic>d</italic> = 1.048) and the A condition (1 Hz: <italic>t</italic> (23) = 2.391, <italic>p</italic> = 0.025, Cohen’s <italic>d</italic> = 0.488; 2 Hz: <italic>t</italic> (23) = 3.808, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001, Cohen’s <italic>d</italic> = 0.777), respectively, suggesting multisensory gains.

<title>Experiment 1b</title>
<p>To further test whether such cortical tracking effect can apply to stimuli with a different speed, Experiment 1b altered the frequencies of the gait cycle and the corresponding step cycle to 0.83 Hz and 1.67 Hz while adopting the same paradigm as Experiment 1a. Consistent with Experiment 1a, the frequency-domain analysis revealed significant cortical tracking of the audiovisual stimuli at the new speeds. As shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d</xref>, both the responses to V, A, and AV stimuli showed clear peaks at step-cycle frequency (1.67 Hz; V: <italic>t</italic> (23) = 3.473, <italic>p</italic> = .001; A: <italic>t</italic> (23) = 9.194, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001; AV: <italic>t</italic> (23) = 8.756, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001; FDR corrected) and its harmonics (3.33 Hz, <italic>p</italic>s &lt; .001, FDR corrected).

<p>In summary, results from Experiments 1a &amp; 1b consistently showed that the cortical tracking of the audiovisual signals at different temporal scales exhibit distinct audiovisual integration modes, i.e., the super-additive effect at gait-cycle frequency and the additive effect at step-cycle frequency, indicating that the cortical tracking effects at the two temporal scales might be driven by functionally dissociable mechanisms.</p>

<title>Cortical tracking of higher-order rhythmic structure contributes to the AVI of BM</title>
<p>To further explore whether and how the cortical tracking of rhythmic structures contributes to the specialized audiovisual processing of BM, both upright and inverted BM stimuli were adopted in Experiment 2. The task and the frequencies of visual stimuli in Experiment 2 were same as Experiment 1a. Specifically, participants were required to perform the change detection task when perceiving upright and inverted visual BM sequences (1 Hz for gait-cycle frequency and 2 Hz for step-cycle frequency) accompanied by frequency congruent (1 Hz) or incongruent (0.6 Hz and 1.4 Hz) footstep sounds (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>). The audiovisual congruency effect, characterized by stronger neural responses in the audiovisual congruent condition compared with the incongruent condition, can be taken as an index of AVI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Fleming et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Maddox et al., 2015</xref>; Wuerger, Crocker-Buque, et al., 2012). A stronger congruency effect in the upright condition relative to the inverted condition characterizes an AVI process specific to BM information.</p>
<p>We contrasted the congruency effect between the upright and inverted conditions to search for clusters showing a significant difference, which equaled identifying an interaction effect, using a cluster-based permutation test over all electrodes (<italic>n</italic> = 1000, <italic>alpha</italic> = 0.05; see <italic>Methods</italic>). At 1 Hz, the congruency effect in the upright condition was significantly stronger than that in the inverted condition in a cluster at the right hemisphere (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>, lower panel, <italic>p</italic> = 0.029; C2, CPz, CP2, CP4, CP6, Pz, P2, P4, P6). Then, we averaged the amplitude of electrodes within the significant cluster and performed two-tailed paired t-tests to examine whether the congruency was significant in the upright and the inverted conditions, respectively. Results showed that (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref>) audiovisual congruency enhanced the oscillatory amplitude only for upright BM (<italic>t</italic> (23) = 4.632, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001, Cohen’s <italic>d</italic> = 0.945) but not when visual BM was inverted (<italic>t</italic> (23) = 0.480, <italic>p</italic> = 0.635, Cohen’s <italic>d</italic> = 0.098). Together, these findings suggest that cortical tracking of the high-order gait cycles involves a domain-specific process exclusively engaged in the AVI of BM.</p>

<p>In contrast, at 2 Hz, no cluster showed a significantly different congruency effect between the upright and inverted conditions (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3d</xref>). We then conducted further analysis based on the electrodes yielded by 1 Hz as marked in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>.

<title>BM-specific cortical tracking correlates with autistic traits</title>
<p>Furthermore, we examined the link between individuals’ autistic traits and the neural responses underpinning the AVI of BM, measured by the difference of congruency effect between the upright and the inverted BM conditions, using Pearson correlation analysis. After removing one outlier (whose neural response exceeded 3 SD from the group mean), we observed an evident negative correlation between individuals’ AQ scores and their neural responses at 1 Hz (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3c</xref>, <italic>r</italic> = -0.493, <italic>p</italic> = 0.017) but not at 2 Hz (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3f</xref>, <italic>r</italic> = -0.158, <italic>p</italic> = .460). The lack of significant results at 2 Hz was not attributable to electrode selection bias based on the significant cluster at 1 Hz, as similar results were observed when we performed the analysis on clusters showing non-selective significant congruency effects at 2 Hz (see the control analysis in Supplementary Information for details). Besides, we split the participants based on their median AQ score and found that, compared with the high AQ group, the low AQ group showed a greater BM-specific cortical tracking effect at 1 Hz but not at 2 Hz. These findings provide further support to the possible linkage between social cognition and cortical tracking of biological motion as well as its dissociation at the two temporal scales (see more details in Supplementary Information).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The current study investigated the neural implementation for the AVI of human BM information. We found that, even under a motion-irrelevant color detection task, observers’ neural activity tracked the temporally corresponding audiovisual BM signals at the frequencies of two rhythmic structures, i.e., the higher-order structure of gait cycle at a larger integration window and the basic-level structure of step cycle at a smaller integration window. The strength of these cortical tracking effects was enhanced under the audiovisual condition than in the visual-only or auditory-only condition, indicating multisensory gains. More crucially, although the cortical tracking of both gait-cycle and step-cycle gain benefits from multisensory correspondence, the mechanisms underlying these two processes appear to be different. At step-cycle frequency, the cortical tracking effect in the AV condition equaled the additive sum of the unisensory conditions. Such linear integration may result from concurrent, independent processing of unisensory inputs without additional interaction of them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Stein et al., 2009</xref>). In contrast, at gait-cycle frequency, the congruent audiovisual signals led to a super-additive multisensory enhancement over the linear combination of auditory and visual conditions (AV &gt; A+V), despite that there was no evident cortical tracking effect in the visual condition, different from previous findings obtained with a motion-relevant change detection task (Shen, Lu, Yuan, et al., 2023). This super-additive multisensory enhancement may bring about decreased thresholds of detection and identification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Stanford et al., 2005</xref>), allowing us to achieve a more clear and stable perception of the external environment and detect weak stimulus changes in time and respond adaptively.</p>
<p>Furthermore, results from Experiment 2 demonstrated that the cortical tracking of rhythmic structure corresponding to the gait cycle rather than the step cycle underlies the specialized processing of audiovisual BM information. In particular, the AVI effect at step-cycle frequency was significant for both upright and inverted BM signals and comparable between the two conditions, while the AVI effect at gait-cycle frequency was only significant in the upright condition and was greater than that in the inverted condition. The inversion effect has long been regarded as a marker of the specificity of BM processing in numerous behavioral and neuroimaging studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Grossman &amp; Blake, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Ma et al., 2022</xref>; Shen, Lu, Yuan, et al., 2023; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Simion et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Troje &amp; Westhoff, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Vallortigara &amp; Regolin, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Wang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Wang &amp; Jiang, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Wang et al., 2022</xref>). Our current findings of the inversion effect in the cortical tracking of audiovisual BM at the gait-cycle frequency suggest that the neural encoding of the higher-order rhythmic structure reflects the AVI of BM and contributes to the specialized processing of BM information. In contrast, the cortical tracking of the step-cycle may reflect the integration of basic motion signals and corresponding sounds. Together, these results reveal that the neural tracking of rhythmic structures at different temporal scales plays distinct roles in the AVI of BM, which may result from the interplay of stimulus-driven and domain-specific mechanisms.</p>
<p>Besides the temporal dynamics of neural activity revealed by the cortical tracking process, we found that the BM-specific AVI effect was associated with neural activity in the right temporoparietal electrodes. This finding likely relates to the activation of the right posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS), a region responding to both auditory and visual BM information and being causally involved in BM perception (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Bidet-Caulet et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Grossman et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Wang et al., 2022</xref>). While previous fMRI studies have observed STS activation when processing spatial or semantic correspondence between audiovisual BM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Meyer et al., 2011</xref>; Wuerger, Parkes, et al., 2012), whether this region also engages in the audiovisual processing of BM signals based on temporal correspondence remains unknown. The current study provides preliminary evidence for such a possibility, inviting future research to localize the exact source of the multisensory integration processes based on imaging data with high spatial and temporal resolutions, such as MEG.</p>
<p>Cortical tracking of external rhythms is also described as cortical entrainment in a broad sense (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Ding et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Obleser &amp; Kayser, 2019</xref>). Controversy remains regarding the involvements of endogenous neural oscillations and stimulus-evoked responses in these processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Duecker et al., 2024</xref>), as it is challenging to fully dissociate these components due to their intricate interplay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Herrmann et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Hosseinian et al., 2021</xref>). Despite the complexity of the neuronal mechanisms, previous research suggests that cortical tracking or entrainment plays a role in the multisensory processing of simple or discrete rhythmic signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Covic et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Keitel &amp; Müller, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Nozaradan et al., 2012b</xref>). These findings may partially explain the non-selective AVI effect at the step-cycle in the current study. However, we found that the cortical tracking of the higher-order rhythmic structure formed by spatiotemporal integration of meaningful BM information (i.e., the gait cycle of upright walkers rather than inverted walkers) is selectively engaged in the AVI of BM, suggesting that the multisensory processing of natural continuous stimuli may involve unique mechanisms besides the purely stimulus-driven AVI process. These findings advance our understanding of the recently proposed view that multi-timescale neural processes coordinate multisensory integration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Senkowski &amp; Engel, 2024</xref>), especially from the perspective of natural stimuli processing. Similar to BM, other natural rhythmic stimuli, like speech and music, also convey hierarchical structures that can entrain neural oscillations at different temporal scales, both in unisensory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Ding et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Doelling &amp; Poeppel, 2015</xref>) and multisensory contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Biau et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Crosse et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Nozaradan et al., 2016</xref>). Possibly, the audiovisual processing of these stimuli engages multi-scale neural coding mechanisms that play distinct functions in perception. Investigating this issue and comparing the results with BM studies will help complete the picture of how the human brain integrates complex, rhythmic information sampled from different sensory modalities to orchestrate perception in natural scenarios.</p>
<p>Since the scope of the current study mainly focused on the neural processing of BM, the task we employed was unrelated to audiovisual correspondence and not for establishing a direct link between neural responses and behavior. This is a limitation of the current study. A recent study demonstrated that listening to frequency-congruent footstep sounds, compared with incongruent sounds, enhanced the visual search for human walkers but not for non-BM stimuli containing the same rhythmic signals, indicating that audiovisual correspondence specifically enhances the perceptual and attentional processing of BM (Shen, Lu, Wang, et al., 2023). Future research could examine whether the cortical tracking of rhythmic structures plays a functional role in such behaviorally relevant tasks. They could also apply advanced neuromodulation techniques to elucidate the causal relevance of the cortical tracking effect to BM perception (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Kösem et al., 2018</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">2020</xref>).</p>
<p>Last but not least, our study demonstrated that the selective cortical tracking of higher-level rhythmic structure in audiovisually congruent BM signals negatively correlated with individual autistic traits. This finding highlights the critical role of the neural tracking of audiovisual BM signals in social cognition. It also offers the first evidence that differences in audiovisual BM processing are already present in nonclinical individuals at the neural level and associated with their autistic traits, extending previous behavioral evidence for atypical audiovisual BM processing in ASD populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Falck-Ytter et al., 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Klin et al., 2009</xref>). Meanwhile, given that impaired audiovisual BM processing at the early stage may influence social development and result in cascading consequences for lifetime impairments in social interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Falck-Ytter et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Klin et al., 2005</xref>), it is worth exploring neural tracking of audiovisual BM signals in children, which may pave the way for utilizing it as a potential early neural marker for ASD.</p>

<title>Visual stimuli</title>
<p>The visual stimuli (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>, left panel) consisted of 13 point-light dots attached to the head and major joints of a human walker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Vanrie &amp; Verfaillie, 2004</xref>). The point-light walker was presented at the center of the screen without translational motion. It conveys rhythmic structures specified by recurrent forward motions of bilateral limbs (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>, right panel). Each step, regardless of left or right foot, occurs recurrently to form a step cycle. The antiphase oscillations of limbs during two steps characterize a gait cycle (Shen, Lu, Yuan, et al., 2023). In Experiment 1a, a full gait cycle took 1 second and was repeated 6 times to form a 6-second walking sequence. That is, the gait-cycle frequency is 1 Hz and the step-cycle frequency is 2 Hz. In Experiment 1b, the gait-cycle frequency was 0.83 Hz and the step-cycle frequency was 1.67 Hz. The gait cycle was repeated 6 times to form a 7.2-second walking sequence.</p>
<p>The stimuli in Experiment 2 were the same as that in Experiment 1a. Meanwhile, the point-light BM was flipped vertically to generate inverted BM (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>, left panel), which preserves the temporal structure of the stimuli but distorts its distinctive kinematic features, such as movement that is compatible with the effect of gravity (Shen, Lu, Yuan, et al., 2023; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Troje &amp; Westhoff, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Wang et al., 2022</xref>).</p>

<p>The experiment was conducted in an acoustically dampened and electromagnetically shielded chamber. Participants completed the task under three conditions (Visual: V; Auditory: A; Audiovisual: AV) with the same procedure (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>) except for the stimuli. In the V condition, each trial began with a white fixation cross (0.42° × 0.42°) displayed at the center of a gray background for a random duration (0.8 s to 1 s). Subsequently, a 6-s point-light walker (3.05°×5.47°) walked toward the left or right at a constant walking cycle frequency (1 Hz). To maintain observers’ attention, 17%–23% of the trials were randomly selected as catch trials, in which the color of the walker changed (the RGB values changed from [255 255 255] to [207 207 207]) one or two times throughout the trial. Each change lasted 0.5 s. Observers were required to report the number of changes (0, 1, or 2) via keypresses as accurately as possible after the point-light display was replaced by a red fixation. The next trial started 2–3 s after the response. In the A condition, the 6 s-stimuli were replaced by a visually static BM figure accompanied by continuous footstep sounds. The frequency of footstep sounds was congruent with the frequency of visual BM in the V condition. In the AV condition, the stimuli were temporally congruent visual BM sequences (as in the V condition) and footstep sounds (as in the A condition). Three conditions were conducted in separate blocks. V condition was performed in the middle of A and AV conditions. The order of A and AV conditions was counterbalanced across participants. Each participant completed 40 experimental trials without changes and 10-15 catch trials in each condition, resulting in a total of 150-165 trials. In each condition, participants completed a practice session with 3 trials to get familiar with the task before the formal EEG experiment.</p>

<title>Experiment 1b</title>
<p>The procedure of Experiment 1b was the same as that for Experiment 1a but with two exceptions. First, to test if the cortical tracking effect can apply to stimuli with a different speed, we altered the frequencies of gait and step cycles to 0.83 Hz and 1.67 Hz. Second, we presented the 3 conditions (V, A, and AV) in a completely random order to eliminate the influence of presentation order. To minimize the potential influence of condition switch, we increased the trial number in the practice session from 3 to 14 for each condition.</p>

<title>Experiment 2</title>
<p>The procedure in Experiment 2 was similar to the AV condition in Experiment 1a, except that the visually displayed BM was accompanied by frequency congruent (1 Hz) or incongruent (0.6 or 1.4 Hz) footstep sounds. Each participant completed a total of 76 experiment trials, consisting of 36 congruent-trials, 20 incongruent-trials with faster sounds (1.4 Hz), and 20 incongruent-trials with slower sounds (0.6 Hz). These trials were assigned to 3 blocks based on the frequency of the footstep sounds, with the order of the three frequencies balanced across participants. Besides, an inverted BM was used as a control to investigate whether there is a specialized mechanism tuned to the AVI of life motion signals. The order of upright and inverted conditions was balanced across participants. Meanwhile, we measured the participants’ autistic traits by using the Autism-Spectrum Quotient, or AQ questionnaire (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Baron-Cohen et al., 2001</xref>).

EEG recordings were pass-filtered between 0.1 and 30 Hz, and down-sampled to 100 Hz. Then the continuous EEG data were cut into epochs ranging from -1s to 6 gait cycles (7.2 s in Experiment 1b and 6 s in other experiments) time-locked to the onset of the visual point-light stimuli. The epochs were visually inspected, and trials contaminated with excessive noise were excluded from the analysis.

<p>A Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) with zero padding (1200) was used to convert the averaged EEG signals from the temporal domain to the spectral domain, resulting in a frequency resolution of 0.083 Hz, i.e., 1/12 Hz, which is sufficient for observing neural responses around the frequency of the rhythmic BM structures in all experiments. When performing FFT, a Hanning window was adopted to minimize spectral leakage. Then, to remove the 1/f trend of the response amplitude spectrum and identify spectral peaks, the response amplitude at each frequency was normalized by subtracting the average amplitude measured at the neighboring frequency bins (two bins on each side) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Nozaradan et al., 2012a</xref>). We calculated the normalized amplitude separately for each electrode (except for electrooculogram electrodes, CB1, and CB2), participant, and condition.</p>
<p>In Experiment 1, the normalized amplitude in all electrodes was averaged and a right-tailed one-sample t-test against zero was performed on the grand average amplitude to test whether the neural response in each frequency bin showed a significant tracking effect or spectral peak. This test was applied to all frequency bins below 5.33 Hz and multiple comparisons were controlled by false discovery rate (FDR) correction at p &lt; 0.05 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Benjamini &amp; Hochberg, 1995</xref>). In Experiment 2, to further identify the BM-specific AVI process, the audiovisual congruency effect was compared between the upright and inverted conditions using a cluster-based permutation test over all electrodes (1000 iterations, requiring a cluster size of at least 2 significant neighbors, a two-sided t-test at p &lt; 0.05 on the clustered data) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Oostenveld et al., 2011</xref>; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://fieldtriptoolbox.org">http://fieldtriptoolbox.org</ext-link>). This allowed us to identify the spatial distribution of the BM-specific congruency effect.</p>

<title>Results on other peaks in Experiment 1</title>
<p>As shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref><bold>&amp;d</bold>, the audiovisual BM signals induced significant amplitude peaks at 1f (1/0.83 Hz), 2f (2/1.67 Hz), and 4f (4/3.33 Hz) relative to the gait cycle frequency (<italic>p</italic>s &lt; .001; FDR corrected). To further test the roles of the neural activity at different frequencies, we analyzed the audiovisual integration modes at each frequency, by comparing the neural responses in the AV condition with the sum of those in the A and V conditions. Given that Experiments 1a &amp; 1b yielded similar results, we collapsed the data and presented the results as follows.</p>
<p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Fig.S1</xref>, at 4f, the amplitude of neural responses showed significant peaks in all three conditions (V: <italic>t</italic> (47) = 6.869, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001; A: <italic>t</italic> (47) = 7.938, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001; AV: <italic>t</italic> (47) = 8.303, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001). Moreover, the amplitude in the AV condition was larger than that in the V condition (<italic>t</italic> (47) = 4.855, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, Cohen’s <italic>d</italic> = 0.701;) and the A condition (<italic>t</italic> (47) = 3.080, <italic>p</italic> = .003, Cohen’s <italic>d</italic> = 0.445), respectively, suggesting multisensory gains. In addition, the amplitude in the AV condition was comparable to the unisensory sum (<italic>t</italic> (47) = -1.049, <italic>p</italic> = .300, Cohen’s <italic>d</italic> = -0.151), indicating linear audiovisual integration. These results were similar to those observed at 2f but different from those at 1f, as reported in the main text. Together, these results show a similar additive audiovisual integration mode at 2f and 4f and a super-additive integration mode only at 1f, suggesting that the cortical tracking effects at 2f and 4f may be functionally linked but independent of that at 1f.</p>

<title>Control analysis of correlation in Experiment 2</title>
<p>The control analysis mainly aims to eliminate the potential bias due to electrode selection. As reported in the main text, both correlation analyses at 1 Hz and 2 Hz were performed based on electrodes in the significant cluster observed at 1 Hz because there was no significant cluster at 2 Hz (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref><bold>&amp;d</bold>, lower panel<bold>)</bold>. There is a possibility that these electrodes did not show a significant congruency effect at 2 Hz, either in the upright or the inverted condition, thus were not able to capture the correlation between the variance in neural responses and that in autistic traits. To rule out such a possibility, we conducted a control analysis based on electrodes showing a significant congruency effect at 2 Hz, for the upright (<italic>p</italic> = .004, cluster-based permutation test) and inverted (<italic>p</italic> = .002, cluster-based permutation test) conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Fig. S2a</xref>), respectively. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Fig. S2a</xref>, both upright and inverted stimuli induced a significant congruency effect at 2 Hz (Upright: t (23) = 4.217, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001, Cohen’s d = 0.861; Inverted: t (23) = 5.072, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001, Cohen’s d = 1.035). The difference of congruency effect between upright and inverted conditions is still not significant in the group level (t (23) = -0.689, <italic>p</italic> = 498, Cohen’s d = -0.141), while it shows individual variance (SD = 0.079, range: [-0.173 0.153]) larger than that for the 1 Hz condition (SD = 0.041, range: [-0.023 0.135]), which allows us to identify a correlation if existing. Analysis of these data showed a non-significant correlation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Fig. S2b</xref>, r = -0.091, <italic>p</italic> = .674), similar to the results illustrated in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3f</xref>.</p>

<title>Additional analysis in Experiment 2</title>
<p>To further examine the linkage between autistic traits and the BM-specific cortical tracking effect, we split the participants into high (above 20) and low (below or equal to 20) AQ groups by the median AQ score (20) of this sample. Similar to correlation analysis, one outlier, whose BM-specific audiovisual congruency effect (Upright – Inverted) in neural responses at 1 Hz exceeds 3 SD from the group mean, was removed from the following analysis. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">Fig.S3</xref>, at 1 Hz, participants with low AQ showed a greater cortical tracking effect compared with high AQ participants (<italic>t</italic> (21) = 2.127, <italic>p</italic> = 0.045). At 2 Hz, low and high AQ participants showed comparable neural responses (<italic>t</italic> (22) = 0.946, <italic>p</italic> = 0.354). These results are in line with the correlation analysis, providing further support to the relevance between social cognition and cortical tracking of biological motion as well as its dissociation at the two temporal scales.</p>

<p><bold>Public Reviews:</bold></p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Shen et al. conducted three experiments to study the cortical tracking of the natural rhythms involved in biological motion (BM), and whether these involve audiovisual integration (AVI). They presented participants with visual (dot) motion and/or the sound of a walking person. They found that EEG activity tracks the step rhythm, as well as the gait (2-step cycle) rhythm. The gait rhythm specifically is tracked superadditively (power for A+V condition is higher than the sum of the A-only and V-only condition,</p>
<p>Experiments 1a/b), which is independent of the specific step frequency (Experiment 1b). Furthermore, audiovisual integration during tracking of gait was specific to BM, as it was absent (that is, the audiovisual congruency effect) when the walking dot motion was vertically inverted (Experiment 2). Finally, the study shows that an individual's autistic traits are negatively correlated with the BM-AVI congruency effect.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The three experiments are well designed and the various conditions are well controlled. The rationale of the study is clear, and the manuscript is pleasant to read. The analysis choices are easy to follow, and mostly appropriate.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>On revision, the authors are careful not to overinterpret an analysis where the statistical test is not independent from the data (channel) selection criterion.</p>

<p>Thanks for the suggestion and we have done this according to your recommendations below.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p>
<p>Re: the double-dipping concern: I appreciate the revision. Just to clarify: my concern rests with the selection of *electrodes* based on the interaction test for the 1Hz condition. The 2Hz condition analogous test yields no significant electrodes. You perform subsequent tests (t-tests and 3-way interaction) on the data averaged across the electrodes that were significant for the 1Hz condition. Therefore, these tests will be biased to find a pattern reflecting an interaction at 1Hz, while no similar bias exists for an effect at 2Hz. Therefore, there is a bias to observe a 3-way interaction, and simple effects compatible with a 2-way interaction only for 1Hz, not for 2Hz (which is exactly what you found). There is no good statistical alternative here, I appreciate that, but the bias exists nonetheless. I think the wording is improved in this revision, and the evidence is convincing even in light of this bias.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We are grateful for your thoughtful comments on the analytical methods. We appreciate your concerns regarding the potential bias of examining 3-way interaction based on electrodes yielding a 2-way interaction effect. To address this issue, we have conducted a bias-free analysis based on electrodes across the whole brain. The results showed a similar pattern of 3-way interaction as previously reported (p = 0.051), suggesting that the previous findings might not be caused by electrode selection. Given that the main results of Experiment 2 were not based on whole-brain analysis, we did not involve this analysis in the main text, and we have removed the three-way interaction results based on selected electrodes from the manuscript to reduce potential concerns. It is also noteworthy that, when performing analyses based on channels independent of the interaction effect at 1 Hz (i.e., significant congruency effects in the upright and inverted conditions, respectively, at 2Hz), we got similar results as reported in the main text (i.e., non-significant interaction and correlation at 2 Hz). These results were presented in the supplementary file in previous versions and mentioned in the correlation part of the Results section (see Fig. S2). Once again, we sincerely appreciate your careful review of our research. We hope the abovementioned points adequately address your concern.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors evaluate spectral changes in electroencephalography (EEG) data as a function of the congruency of audio and visual information associated with biological motion (BM) or non-biological motion. The results show supra-additive power gains in the neural response to gait dynamics, with trials in which audio and visual information was presented simultaneously producing higher average amplitude than the combined average power for auditory and visual conditions alone. Further analyses suggest that such supra-additivity is specific to BM and emerges from temporoparietal areas. The authors also find that the BM-specific supra-additivity is negatively correlated with autism traits.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The manuscript is well-written, with a concise and clear writing style. The visual presentation is largely clear. The study involves multiple experiments with different participant groups. Each experiment involves specific considered changes to the experimental paradigm that both replicate the previous experiment's finding yet extend it in a relevant manner.</p>
<p>In the first revisions of the paper, the manuscript better relays the results and anticipates analyses, and this version adequately resolves some concerns I had about analysis details. In a further revision, it is clarified better how the results relate to the various competing hypotheses on how biological motion is processed.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Still, it is my view that the findings of the study are basic neural correlate results that offer only minimal constraint towards the question of how the brain realizes the integration of multisensory information in the service of biological motion perception, and the data do not address the causal relevance of observed neural effects towards behavior and cognition. The presence of an inversion effect suggests that the supraadditivity is related to cognition, but that leaves open whether any detected neural pattern is actually consequential for multi-sensory integration (i.e., correlation is not causation). In other words, the fact that frequency-specific neural responses to the [audio &amp; visual] condition are stronger than those to [audio] and [visual] combined does not mean this has implications for behavioral performance. While the correlation to autism traits could suggest some relation to behavior and is interesting in its own right, this correlation is a highly indirect way of assessing behavioral relevance. It would be helpful to test the relevance of supra-additive cortical tracking on a behavioral task directly related to the processing of biological motion to justify the claim that inputs are being integrated in the service of behavior. Under either framework, cortical tracking or entrainment, the causal relevance of neural findings toward cognition is lacking.</p>
<p>Overall, I believe this study finds neural correlates of biological motion that offer some constraint toward mechanism, and it is possible that the effects are behaviorally relevant, but based on the current task and associated analyses this has not been shown (or could not have been, given the paradigm).</p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p>
<p>Thank you for your revisions; I have updated the Strengths section, and reworded the weaknesses section. I now concede that the neural effects observed offer some constraint towards what the neural mechanisms for AV integration for BM are, whereas in my previous review, I said too strongly that these results do not offer any information about mechanism.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you again for your insightful thoughts and comments on our research. They have contributed greatly to enhancing the discussion of the article and provided valuable inspiration for future exploration of causal mechanisms.</p>
