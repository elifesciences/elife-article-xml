<title>Abstract</title><p>Next-generation influenza vaccines aim to elicit cross-reactive humoral responses to multiple influenza subtypes. Such increased breadth would not only improve seasonal vaccines but may afford ‘universal’ protection against influenza subtypes including those with pandemic potential. Here, we describe a “beads-on-a-string” (BOAS) immunogen, that tandemly links up to eight distinct hemagglutinin (HA) head domains from circulating and non-circulating influenzas. These BOAS are immunogenic in the murine model and elicit comparable serum responses to each individual component. Notably, we also find that BOAS elicit cross-reactive, and neutralizing responses to influenza subtypes not included in the immunizing immunogen. Furthermore, BOAS conjugation to protein-based ferritin nanoparticles does not significantly augment serum responses suggesting that our BOAS platform is sufficient for eliciting cross-reactive responses without off-target effects induced by the nanoparticle scaffold. This mix-and-match immunogen design strategy is a robust platform for eliciting responses to multiple influenza subtypes via a single immunogen, and a potential platform for other viral glycoproteins.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Influenza viruses, despite continuous surveillance and annual vaccination, are a significant public health problem resulting in ∼500,000 deaths per year<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. This is largely a consequence of viral evolution as it circulates within animal reservoirs (<italic>e.g.,</italic> avian, swine) and humans and ultimately impacts vaccine effectiveness. To combat this, global surveillance is necessary to inform re-formulation of influenza vaccines to match circulating strains. However, long lead times for vaccine preparation in eggs and mutations acquired during that process<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup> can lead to vaccine mismatch and subsequent ineffectiveness. The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has additionally underscored the need for pandemic preparedness as humans increasingly come into contact with animal reservoirs. Indeed, several avian influenzas, such as H5N1, H7N9 and H9N2, are currently being monitored for their pandemic potential. Thus, there is an urgent need to develop so-called “universal” influenza vaccines that provide protection against both currently circulating (<italic>e.g.,</italic> H1N1s, H3N2s, and Bs) and potentially pandemic viruses.</p>
<p>Several approaches have been taken to improve upon current influenza vaccines, largely focused on the influenza surface glycoprotein, hemagglutinin (HA). A major goal of immunogen design efforts is to elicit antibodies toward conserved epitopes on HA, including the receptor binding site (RBS)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>, trimer interface<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>, and stem<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>; antibodies targeting such epitopes are often broadly protective. Indeed, RBS-directed antibodies often are potently neutralizing, as they directly inhibit HA engagement with host cell sialic acid, while interface- and stem-directed antibodies generally protect via Fc-dependent mechanisms (<italic>e.g.,</italic> ADCC, ADCP). Several rational immunogen design approaches<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup> such as epitope removal<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>, domain chimeras<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>, computational sequence optimization (COBRAs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>, epitope resurfacing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup> and hyperglycosylation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup> attempt to focus to these epitopes.</p>
<p>An additional strategy to enrich for cross-reactive antibodies includes increasing antigen valency by displaying multiple antigens on a scaffold, such as a nanoparticle<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>. Such multivalency is thought to enhance immunogenicity and antigenicity by spacing antigens near one another in order to effectively cross-link B cell receptors (BCRs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>. Ferritin, which can display 24 antigens at its 8 three-fold axes, has been used for influenza, Epstein-Barr virus, coronavirus, and HIV glycoproteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>. For influenza, following immunization with a mixture of homotypic full-length seasonal H1, H3, and influenza B HA trimers displayed on ferritin nanoparticles, mice elicited responses with enhanced potency and breadth relative to the trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (TIV) standard<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>. Based on this success, they then designed “mosaic” ferritin nanoparticles that displayed up to eight antigenically distinct H1 subtype HA receptor binding domains (RBDs) on a single particle, which outperformed admixtures of homotypic nanoparticles and elicited cross-reactive H1 broadly neutralizing antibodies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>. Further iterations of nanoparticle immunogens have co-displayed multiple full-length HA antigens on virus-like particles (VLPs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup> and <italic>de novo</italic> designed particles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup>, and the latter is currently in clinical trials<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>An alternative approach for multivalent display involves tandemly linking antigens into a single polypeptide. This method may alleviate manufacturing challenges related to preparing multiple individual components for mosaic nanoparticles while still increasing size and valency of antigens. For example, using domain III from the dengue envelope surface glycoprotein, a bivalent<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup> or quadrivalent<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup> tandemly linked immunogen elicited neutralizing antibody responses to all four dengue serotypes and provided protection upon challenge. An analogous approach tandemly linked four different coronavirus RBDs into a single immunogen<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup>. These “quartets” elicited responses to each individual components similar to a “mosaic-4” nanoparticle that displayed monomeric RBDs on the surface of a virus like particle (VLP) nanoparticle<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup>; these approaches were then combined and quartets displaying four or eight unique RBDs were multivalently displayed on VLP nanoparticles. This combinatorial approach augmented both neutralization titers and cross-reactive responses.</p>
<p>Here, we tandemly linked multiple HA subtypes into a single immunogen via short, flexible linkers in a “plug and play” platform we call “beads-on-a-string” or BOAS. These recombinantly produced, protein-based immunogens have between three and eight unique HA heads including circulating and non-circulating A and B influenzas. Mice immunized with either 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8mer BOAS elicited responses to matched and mismatched HA components and could neutralize subsequent replication-restricted reporter (R3) viruses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></sup>. To further enhance valency, we generated two 4mer BOAS that included 8 different HA heads, conjugated both to ferritin nanoparticles using SpyTag-SpyCatcher<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref></sup>, and showed that the serum responses elicited similar responses to the 8mer. Collectively, these BOAS immunogens could serve as a means to elicit responses to multiple HA subtypes as a single immunogen and represents a general approach for multivalent display of other viral antigens.</p>

<title>Design and characterization of beads-on-a-string (BOAS)</title>
<p>Monomeric hemagglutinin (HA) heads representing antigenically distinct subtypes were tandemly linked together as a single linear construct, separated by a short, flexible glycine-serine-serine (GSS) linker, which we termed beads-on-a-string (BOAS) immunogens. Eight unique HA subtypes spanning group 1 and 2 influenza A viruses, as well as an influenza B virus, from seasonal, circulating, and non-circulating influenzas were selected to understand the permissibility of the platform to express different HAs (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 1A</bold></xref>). We found that monomeric HA head domains varied in expression levels depending on the boundaries selected: H1, H5, and H7 HA monomers spanned residues 57-261 (H3 numbering), whereas H2, H3, H4, H9, and B HA monomers spanned residues 37-316 (H3 numbering) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 1B</bold></xref>). We then asked whether we could tandemly link multiple HA heads together as a single construct. Using linkers with either two, three, or four GSS repeats, we tandemly linked representative H1, H3, and B HAs (<bold>Supplemental Figure 1A</bold>) together for recombinant expression in mammalian cells. Each construct, regardless of linker length expressed to similar levels (<bold>Supplemental Figure 1B</bold>) and each individual HA component could be detected with a conformation specific and subtype specific monoclonal antibody (mAb) (<bold>Supplemental Figure 1C</bold>). We next assessed whether order of the HA heads adversely affected expression or accessibility to the conformation-specific mAb. Using H5, H7, and H9 HA heads we created two constructs 1) H5-H9-H7 and 2) H9-H5-H7 each with a four GSS linker. Each construct had comparable levels of expression and reactivity to the respective mAbs (<bold>Supplemental Figure 2</bold>).</p>

<p>Based on these initial data, we next designed six constructs with three to eight individual HA head components from representative H1, H2, H3, H4, H5, H7, H9, and B influenzas; to maximize spacing between each HA component we used the 4x GSS linker. Each BOAS was cloned into a single polypeptide chain with a protease-cleavable C-terminal purification tag (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 1C</bold></xref>). We synthesized six different BOAS, and define each construct as 3mer, 4mer, etc., referencing the number of HA components (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 1D</bold></xref>). Each BOAS construct could be purified to homogeneity as assayed by SDS-PAGE after immobilized metal affinity chromatography (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 2A</bold></xref>) and correspond to the expected molecular weight following proteolytic cleavage of native glycans with PNGase-F (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 2B</bold></xref>). After size-exclusion chromatography (SEC), the non-PNGase-treated BOAS were monodispersed (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 2C</bold></xref>).</p>

<graphic xlink:href="566478v1_fig2.tif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/>
</fig>
<p>We then analyzed the BOAS using negative stain electron microscopy (NS-EM). Individual HAs were readily discernable and equal to the number of components in the respective BOAS (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2E</xref></bold>); we observed that the 3mer could adopt both extended and collapsed, triangular-like conformations (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 2D</bold></xref>), whereas longer BOAS, such as the 8mer, adopted a rosette-like conformation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 2E</bold></xref>). This is likely a consequence of the flexible GSS linker separating the individual HA head components.</p>
<p>To assess conformational integrity and ensure that each HA present was properly folded, we assembled a panel of conformation- and subtype-specific mAbs to assay each individual component. This included mAb S5V2-29<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup> a broadly-reactive interface-directed positive control antibody and mAbs 5J8<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>, 2G1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>, K03.12<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref></sup>, P2-D9 (<bold>Supplemental Figure 3</bold>), H5.3<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref></sup>, H7.167<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref></sup>, and H1209<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref></sup> which are specific to H1, H2, H3, H5, H5, H7 and B subtypes, respectively; an H9 conformation-specific mAb was not available. Each individual HA component was detected using subtype-specific mAb in ELISA, and overall affinity for each component was comparable regardless of BOAS length (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 2F</bold></xref>). Collectively, these data support a plug-and-play platform that can readily exchange HA components while retaining conformational integrity.</p>

<title>Immunogenicity of BOAS</title>
<p>To determine immunogenicity of each BOAS, we performed a prime-boost-boost vaccination regimen in C5BL/6 mice at two-week intervals (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 3A</bold></xref>) and tested serum reactivity to both BOAS immunogen as well as individual full-length HA trimers of each component. Serum titers against the immunogen were detectable after a single prime, and increased following a boost, and stayed relatively level until day 42 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 3B</bold></xref>). Serum responses varied for differing BOAS lengths, with the 4mer and 5mer BOAS being the most immunogenic (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 3C</bold></xref>). BOAS-elicited serum, regardless of its length, reacted to full-length HAs representing individual components (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 3D</bold></xref>). For example, the 6mer, which contains heads of H1, H2, H3, H4, H5, and H7, showed reactivity to full length matched HAs. Interestingly, some BOAS elicited cross-reactivity to mis-matched components not present in the immunogen. For example, the 3mer, which contained H1, H2, and H3 HA heads, elicited detectable titers to an H4 HA, and the 5mer, which contained H1, H2, H3, H4, and H5 HA heads, had detectable titers to H7 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 3D</bold></xref>).</p>

<title>Cross-reactivity of immune responses</title>
<p>To understand potential cross-reactivity observed in the serum analyses, across we used a Consurf-like<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref></sup> method to assess sequence conservation across the eight HA components in the BOAS. Each component of the BOAS was aligned structurally to the H2 head domain and scored at each position for their amino acid conservation at each position on a scale of 1 to 9. These were then pseudo-colored on the structure to visualize conserved and variable epitopes across the head domain surface (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 4A</bold></xref>). We observed regions of both significant variability as well as conservation, notably the trimer interface (TI), as well as the core sialic acid interacting residues in the receptor binding site (RBS), the latter which remained nearly 100% conserved in all BOAS (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 4A</bold></xref>). This was quantitated by taking the average amino acid (AA) conservation score across both the RBS and interface epitopes as well as the entire sequence, and we see that these epitopes retain higher conservation relative to the overall sequence as BOAS length increases. We then determined approximate degrees of focusing to the TI and RBS via a serum competition ELISA using mAbs. All the BOAS maintained, approximately, between 15-35% focusing to the TI epitope, whereas focusing the RBS was more variable (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 4C</bold></xref>). Both RBS focusing (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 4D</bold></xref>) and TI focusing (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 4E</bold></xref>) trended similarly with homology scores for each epitope, indicating epitope conservation may be influencing immune focusing to particular epitopes.</p>

Of the mismatched viruses, only the 5mer also strongly neutralized H7 virus. Finally, we tested neutralization titers to H5N1 virus. However, only the BOAS-NP serum neutralized this virus, despite the component being present in the other BOAS tested. Serum from the BOAS-conjugated nanoparticle group elicited neutralization titers to all four viruses though at varying degrees relative to the BOAS alone.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Here we engineered “beads-on-a-string” (BOAS) that included tandemly linked, antigenically distinct HA heads as a single construct. This platform allows a mixing-and-matching of up to eight distinct HA heads from both influenza A and B viruses. Furthermore, we showed that the order and number of HA heads can vary without losing reactivity to conformation-specific mAbs <italic>in vitro</italic>, highlighting the flexibility of this platform. Mice immunized with BOAS had comparable serum reactivity to each individual component; though relative binding and neutralization titers varied between immunogens; this is likely a consequence of length and/or composition. Further oligomerization for increased multivalent display was accomplished by conjugating two 4mer BOAS inclusive of eight distinct HA heads to a ferritin nanoparticle via SpyTag/SpyCatcher ligation. Similar to the BOAS, these conjugated nanoparticles elicited similar titers to all eight HA components and could neutralize matched viruses.</p>
<p>Thus, tandemly linking HA heads is a robust method for displaying multiple influenza subtypes in a single protein-based immunogen. Binding titers were elicited to all components present in the immunogen, and there was no significant correlation between HA position within the BOAS (<italic>i.e.,</italic> terminal or internal) and immunogenicity. However, relative immunogenicities of each HA varied despite the guaranteed equimolar display of each subtype. There were qualitatively immunodominant HAs, notably H4 and H9, and these were relatively consistent across BOAS in which they were a component. Further studies using the modularity of the BOAS could further deconvolute relative immunodominances of HA subtypes.</p>
<p>Despite similar binding titers across multiple BOAS lengths, expression levels and neutralization titers were quite variable. While all 3mer to 8mer BOAS could be overexpressed, expression inversely correlated with overall length. To mitigate this, multiple BOAS (<italic>e.g.,</italic> two 4mers) or conjugation to protein-based nanoparticles, as was done here, could be used to ensure coverage of each desired HA subtype. Furthermore, neutralization titers were quite variable across different BOAS lengths despite similar binding titers. This may be related to multiple factors including homology, stability, and accessibility of neutralizing epitopes for different BOAS lengths. Studies manipulating BOAS composition at intermediate lengths could optimize neutralizing responses to particular influenzas of interest.</p>
<p>Based on the immunogenicity of the various BOAS and their ability to elicit neutralizing responses, it may not be necessary to maximize the number of HA heads into a single immunogen. Indeed, it qualitatively appears that the 4mer and 5mer BOAS were the most immunogenic and this length may be sufficient to effectively engage and crosslink BCR for potent stimulation. Furthermore, the 5mer elicited cross-reactive and neutralizing responses to an H7 HA, a mis-matched HA that was not present in the immunogen. Similarly, the 3mer BOAS, which does not contain an H4 component, also elicited detectable titers to the H4 HA. This observed cross-reactivity is likely due to sequence conservation between the HAs, as H3 and H4 share ∼51% sequence identity (<bold>Supplemental Figure 5</bold>). However, total sequence homology alone is not sufficient to explain this phenomena, as the 3mer elicited low titers to H5 despite sharing ∼46% and ∼62% overall sequence identity with H1 and H2, respectively.</p>
<p>Potential enrichment of antibodies targeting the conserved RBS and trimer interface epitopes may also be contributing to observed cross-reactivity. Both epitopes are relatively conserved across all BOAS lengths (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 4C</bold></xref>), and the two BOAS showing the most cross-reactivity, the 3mer and 5mer, elicit a significant portion of the serum response toward both RBS and interface epitopes as determined via a serum competition assay with available epitope-directed antibodies (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 4B</bold></xref>). Isolated interface-directed antibodies, in particular, can engage more than nine unique subtypes across both group 1 and 2 influenzas<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>, and our monomeric head-based BOAS immunogens, have the otherwise occluded trimer interface epitope exposed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. Furthermore, we have previously shown that this trimer interface epitope, when exposed, is immunodominant in the murine model<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>. Further studies with different combinations of HAs could aid in understanding how length and composition influences epitope focusing. Combining the BOAS platform with other immune-focusing approaches<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup> such as hyperglycosylation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref></sup> or resurfacing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref></sup> could enhance cross-reactive responses Additionally, modifying linker spacing and rigidity can also be used as a mechanism to enhance BCR cross-linking and thus enhance cross-reactive B cell activation and elicitation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>BOAS can be further multimerized via conjugation to a surface of a nanoparticle. Interestingly, this only had a marginal effect on immunogenicity. The BOAS conjugated-nanoparticle elicited titers of ∼10<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 6B</bold></xref>), whereas the best BOAS alone reached an order of magnitude greater (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig"><bold>Fig 3C</bold></xref>). This appears in contrast with other studies where attaching an antigen to a nanoparticle scaffold enhanced immunogenicity and neutralization potency. One recent example designed quartets of antigenically distinct SARS-like betacoronavirus RBDs coupled to an mi3-VLP scaffold via a similar SpyCatchter/SpyTag system and showed increased binding and neutralization titers following conjugation to the NP compared to quartet alone. This discrepancy may be in part due to the larger mi3 nanoparticle which displays 60 copies of the antigen rather than the 24 copies displayed on the ferritin nanoparticle used in this study. Nevertheless, HA-specific responses were similar whether the BOAS were conjugated to the nanoparticle or not, indicating that HA proximity to the NP surface did not impact responses to each component. This observation is consistent with betacoronavirus quartet nanoparticles as well. Additionally, BOAS conjugation to the nanoparticle significantly reduced the scaffold-directed response to near baseline. The addition of the large BOAS projections to the surface of the nanoparticle likely masked the immunogenic scaffold epitopes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Collectively, this study demonstrates the versatility of the BOAS platform to present multiple HA subtypes as a single immunogen. This “plug-and-play” approach can readily exchange HAs to elicit desired immune responses. BOAS are potentially advantageous over other multivalent display platforms such as protein-based nanoparticles, which can produce off-target responses due to their inherent immunogenicity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>. Furthermore, when genetic fusions of the antigen to nanoparticles is not possible, SpyCatcher/SpyTag (or another suitable conjugation approach) must be used, further contributing to scaffold-specific responses as well as additional multi-step manufacturing and purification challenges. Not only does our BOAS platform circumvent these potential caveats, but because this is a single polypeptide chain, this immunogen could readily be formulated as an mRNA lipid nanoparticle (LNP)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref></sup>. The BOAS platform forms the basis for next-generation influenza vaccines and can more broadly be readily adapted to other viral antigens.</p>

<title>Homology Analyses</title>
<p>Homology analyses on HA BOAS was conducted using a manual method analogous to Consurf<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref></sup>. HA head domain structures (or closely related variants) were aligned in Pymol to the H2 JP-57 structure (PDB: 2WRE). Structures used for alignments were as follows: H1 (PDB: 6XGC), H3 (PDB: 4O5N), H4 (PDB: 5XL3), H5 (PDB: 6CFG), H7 (PDB: 6FYU), H9 (PDB: 1JSI), B (PDB: 4FQJ). Any mis-matches in specific amino acids were adjusted using the mutagenesis wizard in Pymol. Following structural alignment, each position on the HA head domain was scored for % aa identity at each position on a scale of 1-9, where 1 = 10-19% identical, 2 = 20-29% identical … to 9 = 90-100% identical, which we refer to as a “conservation score”. This was repeated for each composition of BOAS (i.e. 3mer, 4mer, 5mer, … 8mer). Each position on the H2 structure was then pseudo colored based on the conservation score. Average amino acid conservation scores were defined as the average of conservation score over the whole sequence (overall), or of amino acids within a given epitope. Interface epitope amino acids were defined as residues 60, 86-106, and 212-232 (H1 numbering), and RBS epitope amino acids were defined as residues 94-96, 128-146, 153-161, 182-194, and 222-229 (H1 numbering).</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this manuscript by Thronlow Lamson et al., the authors develop a &quot;beads-on-a-string&quot; or BOAS strategy to link diverse hemagglutinin head domains, to elicit broadly protective antibody responses. The authors are able to generate varying formulations and lengths of the BOAS and immunization of mice shows induction of antibodies against a broad range of influenza subtypes. However, several major concerns are raised, including the stability of the BOAS, that only 3 mice were used for most immunization experiments, and that important controls and analyses related to how the BOAS alone, and not the inclusion of diverse heads, impacts humoral immunity.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Vaccine strategy is new and exciting.</p>
<p>Analyses were performed to support conclusions and improve paper quality.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Controls for how different hemagglutinin heads impact immunity versus the multivalency of the BOAS.</p>
<p>Only 3 mice were used for most experiments.</p>
<p>There were limited details on size exclusion data.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors describe a &quot;beads-on-a-string&quot; (BOAS) immunogen, where they link, using a non-flexible glycine linker, up to eight distinct hemagglutinin (HA) head domains from circulating and non-circulating influenzas and assess their immunogenicity. They also display some of their immunogens on ferritin NP and compare the immunogenicity. They conclude that this new platform can be useful to elicit robust immune responses to multiple influenza subtypes using one immunogen and that it can also be used for other viral proteins.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The paper is clearly written. While the use of flexible linkers has been used many times, this particular approach (linking different HA subtypes in the same construct resembling adding beads on a string, as the authors describe their display platform) is novel and could be of interest.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The authors did not compare to individuals HA ionized as cocktails and did not compare to other mosaic NP published earlier. It is thus difficult to assess how their BOAS compare.</p>
<p>Other weaknesses include the rationale as to why these subtypes were chosen and also an explanation of why there are different sizes of the HA1 construct (apart from expression). Have the authors tried other lengths? Have they expressed all of them as FL HA1?</p>

<p>This work describes the tandem linkage of influenza hemagglutinin (HA) receptor binding domains of diverse subtypes to create 'beads on a string' (BOAS) immunogens. They show that these immunogens elicit ELISA binding titers against full-length HA trimers in mice, as well as varying degrees of vaccine mismatched responses and neutralization titers. They also compare these to BOAS conjugated on ferritin nanoparticles and find that this did not largely improve immune responses. This work offers a new type of vaccine platform for influenza vaccines, and this could be useful for further studies on the effects of conformation and immunodominance on the resulting immune response.</p>
<p>Overall, the central claims of immunogenicity in a murine model of the BOAS immunogens described here are supported by the data.</p>
<p>Strengths included the adaptability of the approach to include several, diverse subtypes of HAs. The determination of the optimal composition of strains in the 5-BOAS that overall yielded the best immune responses was an interesting finding and one that could also be adapted to other vaccine platforms. Lastly, as the authors discuss, the ease of translation to an mRNA vaccine is indeed a strength of this platform.</p>
<p>One interesting and counter-intuitive result is the high levels of neutralization titers seen in vaccine-mismatched, group 2 H7 in the 5-BOAS group that differs from the 4-BOAS with the addition of a group 1 H5 RBD. At the same time, no H5 neutralization titers were observed for any of the BOAS immunogens, yet they were seen for the BOAS-NP. Uncovering where these immune responses are being directed and why these discrepancies are being observed would constitute informative future work.</p>
<p>There are a few caveats in the data that should be noted:</p>
<p>(1) 20 ug is a pretty high dose for a mouse and the majority of the serology presented is after 3 doses at 20 ug. By comparison, 0.5-5 ug is a more typical range (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6380945/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6380945/</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9980174/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9980174/</ext-link>). Also, the authors state that 20 ug per immunogen was used, including for the BOAS-NP group, which would mean that the BOAS-NP group was given a lower gram dose of HA RBD relative to the BOAS groups.</p>
<p>(2) Serum was pooled from all animals per group for neutralization assays, instead of testing individual animals. This could mean that a single animal with higher immune responses than the rest in the group could dominate the signal and potentially skew the interpretation of this data.</p>
<p>(3) In Figure S2, it looks like an apparent increase in MW by changing the order of strains here, which may be due to differences in glycosylation. Further analysis would be needed to determine if there are discrepancies in glycosylation amongst the BOAS immunogens and how those differ from native HAs.</p>
