<title>Abstract</title>
<p>G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are integral membrane proteins which closely interact with their plasma membrane lipid microenvironment. Cholesterol is a plasma membrane enriched lipid with pivotal roles in the control of membrane fluidity and maintenance of membrane microarchitecture, directly impacting on GPCR stability, dynamics and function. Cholesterol extraction from pancreatic beta cells has previously been shown to disrupt the internalisation, clustering and cAMP responses of the glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R), a class B1 GPCR with key roles in the control of blood glucose levels via the potentiation of insulin secretion in beta cells and weight reduction via the modulation of brain appetite control centres. Here, we unveil the detrimental effect of a high cholesterol diet on GLP-1R-dependent glucoregulation <italic>in vivo</italic>, and the improvement in GLP-1R function that a reduction in cholesterol synthesis using simvastatin exerts in pancreatic islets. We next identify and map sites of cholesterol high occupancy and residence time on active <italic>versus</italic> inactive GLP-1Rs using coarse-grained molecular dynamics (cgMD) simulations, followed by a screen of key residues selected from these sites and detailed analyses of the effects of mutating one of these residues, Val229, to alanine on GLP-1R interactions with cholesterol, plasma membrane behaviours, clustering, trafficking and signalling in pancreatic beta cells and primary islets, unveiling an improved insulin secretion profile for the V229A mutant receptor. This study 1) highlights the role of cholesterol in regulating GLP-1R responses <italic>in vivo</italic>; 2) provides a detailed map of GLP-1R - cholesterol binding sites in model membranes; 3) validates their functional relevance in beta cells; and 4) highlights their potential as locations for the rational design of novel allosteric modulators with the capacity to fine-tune GLP-1R responses.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R), expressed in pancreatic beta cells amongst other tissues including brain, lung, stomach, and heart, is activated by the incretin peptide hormone GLP-1, secreted from enteroendocrine L-cells after food intake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>), to regulate postprandial glucose levels via the potentiation of glucose-dependent insulin secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>). Activation of GLP-1R also promotes beta cell survival, inhibits gastric emptying, regulates food intake and reduces appetite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>), making it a key pharmacological target for various metabolic disorders including type 2 diabetes (T2D) and obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>). Circulation of active GLP-1(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>) hormone is short-lived due to its rapid cleavage into inactive GLP-1(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>) by dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>); peptide analogues of GLP-1 have therefore been developed and successfully used clinically for the treatment of T2D and obesity, including exendin-4, liraglutide, and semaglutide, amongst others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>). Despite their success, access to incretin peptide analogues is challenging for most individuals that require these therapies due to their high cost and complex manufacturing process leading to supply shortages, as well as requirement for refrigeration and administration by injection, together with notable side effects including gastrointestinal disturbances, prompting further research into the development of a new wave of small molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>), including those targeting the receptor as allosteric or ago-allosteric modulators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>).</p>
<p>The GLP-1R is part of the glucagon family of receptors, including the glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide receptor (GIPR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>), the glucagon receptor (GCGR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>), and the glucagon-like peptide-2 receptor (GLP-2R) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>), which are class B1/secretin-like G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) with a typical structure of seven transmembrane domains (7-TMD), a C-terminal tail, and a large N-terminal extracellular domain (ECD) important for peptide agonist binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>). GPCRs transmit extracellular signals via coupling to heterotrimeric G proteins and interactions with β-arrestins, leading to activation of various intracellular signalling cascades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>); the GLP-1R in particular signals preferentially via Gα<sub>s</sub> coupling and adenylate cyclase activation, leading to cAMP accumulation and downstream signal transduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>). Their 7-TMD structure involves intimate interactions with plasma membrane lipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>), known to be non-homogeneously distributed but rather organised in regions known as lipid nanodomains or lipid rafts, enriched in lipid species including sphingolipids and cholesterol, as well as in integral membrane proteins serving as scaffolds for signal transduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>), and GPCR trafficking and sorting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>).</p>
<p>Cholesterol, in particular, has been identified as an allosteric modulator for certain GPCRs, due to its direct binding to (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>) and modulation of GPCR activation, trafficking, and signalling patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>). A previous study from our laboratory established that the GLP-1R function in pancreatic beta cells is also modulated by cholesterol. Specifically, we showed that GLP-1R activation leads to receptor segregation into flotillin-positive lipid nanodomains and that disruption of the plasma membrane architecture by cholesterol extraction with methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MβCD) significantly reduces exendin-4-mediated receptor clustering, internalisation, and cAMP accumulation in beta cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>). Here, we focus on identifying the effect of more nuanced changes in cholesterol content on exendin-4-mediated GLP-1R function in primary islets and <italic>in vivo</italic>, followed by mapping of cholesterol binding sites for both apo-state and active receptor structures using coarse-grained molecular dynamics (cgMD) simulations tailored to identify lipid-receptor interactions, and functional validation of a prominent site for its effects on cholesterol binding, plasma membrane behaviours and exendin-4-mediated GLP-1R function in beta cells and primary islets. Our investigation identifies new potentially druggable locations in the receptor, expanding the existing repertoire of functionally relevant sites for the rational design of novel GLP-1R allosteric modulators based on the modulation of receptor-cholesterol interactions.</p>

<title>Changes in cholesterol content modulate exendin-4-induced GLP-1R behaviours in primary islets and in vivo</title>
<p>To determine the effect of increased cholesterol levels on GLP-1R function, we fed mice a standard chow diet supplemented or not with cholesterol for 5 weeks. We then performed intraperitoneal glucose tolerance tests (IPGTTs) post-administration of vehicle or 1 nmol/kg exendin-4 to determine the glucose lowering effect of pharmacologically targeting the receptor under these conditions. Mice on either diet had similar glucose responses under vehicle conditions; however, those on high cholesterol diet presented worse glucose lowering responses to exendin-4 <italic>versus</italic> chow-fed mice (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>, B), an effect that was maintained when normalised to the corresponding vehicle control (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). Moreover, islets extracted from high cholesterol-fed mice showed decreased exendin-4-induced cAMP responses <italic>ex vivo</italic> (Supplementary Figure 1A), suggesting a direct impact of increased cholesterol levels on GLP-1R signalling.</p>

</fig>
<p>To further evaluate the effect of increased islet cholesterol content on GLP-1R function, islets isolated from wildtype (WT) mice were loaded with MβCD saturated with cholesterol, which led to a significant increase in cholesterol content (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>). Under these conditions, we measured a decrease in insulin secretion in response to exendin-4 <italic>versus</italic> vehicle conditions, primarily due to elevated basal secretion levels at 11 mM glucose (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E, F</xref>), confirming that increased cholesterol levels reduce the GLP-1R glucoregulatory potential by decreasing its capacity to potentiate islet insulin secretion.</p>
<p>We next performed the reverse experiment by decreasing islet cholesterol levels with simvastatin, a long-established hydroxy-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMGCR) inhibitor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>). Filipin staining confirmed decreased islet cholesterol content (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G</xref>), which correlated with increased exendin-4-induced cAMP responses (Supplementary Figure 1B), and exendin-4-induced insulin secretion (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1H, I</xref>) in simvastatin-exposed islets. These effects were accompanied by decreased GLP-1R plasma membrane diffusion under vehicle conditions, measured by Raster Image Correlation Spectroscopy (RICS) in rat insulinoma INS-1 832/3 cells with endogenous GLP-1R deleted [INS-1 832/3 GLP-1R KO cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>)] stably expressing SNAP/FLAG-tagged human GLP-1R (SNAP/FLAG-hGLP-1R), an effect that is normally triggered by agonist binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>), as also observed here (Supplementary Figure 1C, D). Taken together, these results demonstrate that changes in cholesterol levels have specific effects on beta cell GLP-1R behaviours, indicating the potential existence of direct interactions between the receptor and this plasma membrane-enriched lipid.</p>

<title>Coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations reveal GLP-1R cholesterol binding sites and state-dependent cholesterol binding modes</title>
<p>To gain insights into the precise location of cholesterol interactions with the GLP-1R, cgMD simulations were employed to study both active (corresponding to agonist bound) and inactive (apo-) states of GLP-1R in a model mammalian plasma membrane using the latest Martini 3 forcefield and cholesterol parameters (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). The PyLipID package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>) was employed to characterise cholesterol interactions for each receptor state. Two key parameters were measured: occupancy, defined as the percentage of frames in the trajectory where any cholesterol molecule is within the cutoff distance from the receptor, and interaction residence time, defined as the time that a cholesterol molecule remains in the binding site, providing information about the strength of the interaction (full data included in Supplementary Tables 1 and 2). Occupancy values for each receptor residue in both states were calculated and displayed as heatmaps, with the top 10 residues per state indicated in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>. The receptor active and inactive states exhibited similar top occupancy residues, with hydrophobic residues such as Phe, Leu, Ile, and Val enriched in both states. A generally similar profile was observed for the top 30 highest occupancy residues in active <italic>versus</italic> inactive states, with some subtle differences noted in the receptor transmembrane domains TM2 and TM6 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>The top three cholesterol binding sites, displaying the highest cholesterol residence times for both states, were calculated using the PyLipID package (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D, E</xref>). Interestingly, notable differences were observed in these sites between the two receptor states: for the active state, site I (purple) was located in the upper TM1 and TM7 region, while in the inactive state, site I (cyan) was found in the lower TM5 and TM6 region, an area which undergoes key structural changes upon G protein engagement and GLP-1R activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>) and might therefore represent a state-specific cholesterol binding site. Site II (orange) was similar for both states but presented subtle differences, with an additional cholesterol pocket involving the Trp in extracellular loop 2 (ECL2) being more pronounced in the inactive <italic>versus</italic> the active state. Site III (green) showed some degree of variation between the two states; in the inactive state, two TM5 residues (Val319 and Phe315) formed an additional cholesterol pocket with TM4, presenting the highest average residence time (186 ns) across all sites, while, in the active state, the cholesterol pocket was located closer to the bottom of TM3 and TM4, involving Leu260 in ECL2.</p>
<p>To evaluate the functional relevance of the GLP-1R cholesterol binding sites identified during the cgMD simulations, 12 residues were selected within or at the periphery of these sites and mutated to alanine by site-directed mutagenesis (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>). Alanine mutations for four of the selected residues (Ile323, Val160, Gly151, and His363) were predicted to cause changes in the GLP-1R structure in the active state by altering the cavity or causing changes in exposed residues and breakages in salt bridges between residues, while a further three alanine mutated residues (Val229, Gly151, and His363) were predicted to cause changes in the inactive GLP-1R structure (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2G</xref>). SNAP/FLAG-tagged human GLP-1Rs (SNAP/FLAG-hGLP-1Rs) with single alanine substitutions for each selected residue were successfully expressed in INS-1 832/3 GLP-1R KO cells with no significant differences detected in cell surface expression levels <italic>versus</italic> WT GLP-1R (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2H</xref>, top graph). Mutant receptors were then screened for their capacity to undergo exendin-4-induced internalisation, as this GLP-1R property is severely inhibited following cholesterol extraction with MβCD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>). Four alanine mutated residues, V229A, V160A, I165A, and L401A, caused a significant decrease in GLP-1R internalisation <italic>versus</italic> WT receptor, with GLP-1R V229A and V160A causing a ∼40%, and I165A and L401A a ∼30% decrease in internalisation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2H</xref>, bottom graph). GLP-1R V229A was selected for further detailed analysis of the effects of modifying a GLP-1R-cholesterol binding site residue on GLP-1R beta cell behaviours.</p>

<title>GLP-1R V229A substitution affects GLP-1R-cholesterol interactions and plasma membrane behaviours in pancreatic beta cells</title>
<p>We next generated INS-1 832/3 GLP-1R KO sublines stably expressing SNAP/FLAG-hGLP-1R WT or V229A. As expected, no difference in surface expression was detected between WT and V229A receptors (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A, B</xref>). To determine the effect of the V229A substitution on the overall GLP-1R binding to cholesterol in active <italic>versus</italic> inactive conditions, cells from both sublines were labelled with PhotoClick cholesterol and exposed to UV light prior to SNAP/FLAG-hGLP-1R purification by anti-FLAG immunoprecipitation and click chemistry to fluorescently label covalently bound PhotoClick cholesterol (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>). Resulting samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and gels imaged under fluorescence followed by anti-SNAP Western blotting (Supplementary Figure 2A). Quantification of GLP-1R-bound cholesterol in both WT and V229A receptors following vehicle <italic>versus</italic> acute (2 minute) exendin-4 stimulation showed a significant decrease in cholesterol binding to GLP-1R V229A in vehicle conditions without modifying cholesterol binding after agonist stimulation compared to GLP-1R WT (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>). Co-localisation of SNAP/FLAG-hGLP-1R with cholesterol in the same cells using the fluorescent D4H*-mCherry probe to label plasma membrane cholesterol at the cytosolic leaflet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>) corroborated our previous results as we measured a significant decrease in co-localisation between GLP-1R V229A and cholesterol under vehicle conditions compared to WT GLP-1R (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E-G</xref>).</p>

<p>While we could not measure any changes in receptor conformational shift following exendin-4 binding between GLP-1R WT and V229A (Supplementary Figure 2B, C), quantification of GLP-1R plasma membrane diffusion coefficients using RICS in INS-1 832/3 SNAP/FLAG-hGLP-1R WT <italic>versus</italic> V229A cells revealed a pronounced reduction in GLP-1R V229A plasma membrane diffusion compared to WT GLP-1R under vehicle conditions (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A, B</xref>), to a similar extent to the reduction caused by exendin-4 binding to GLP-1R WT, as observed here and previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>), and recapitulating the effect triggered by reduced cholesterol levels following simvastatin exposure (Supplementary Figure 1C, D). Single particle tracking (SPT) of human GLP-1R fused to monoclonal EGFP (hGLP-1R-mEGFP) WT <italic>versus</italic> V229A imaged by total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy also showed reduced total displacement and speed (displacement over time) of V229A <italic>versus</italic> WT receptors under vehicle conditions, with these parameters also decreased following WT GLP-1R stimulation with exendin-4 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>). Finally, exendin-4-induced activation of both WT and V229A GLP-1R tended to reduce the diffusion of lipids at the plasma membrane labelled with the environmentally sensitive Laurdan probe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>), with no differences in Laurdan lateral diffusion between WT and V229A. RICCS cross-correlation analysis of Laurdan-labelled lipid co-diffusion with GLP-1R WT <italic>versus</italic> V229A demonstrated a reduction in the movement of the GLP-1R-lipid complex for WT receptors after exendin-4 stimulation, with a tendency for V229A receptors to exhibit the same effect under vehicle conditions, resulting in no significant change for GLP-1R V229A-lipid complex diffusion between vehicle and exendin-4-stimulated conditions (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>, Supplementary Figure 2D).</p>

<p>Number and Brightness (N&amp;B) analysis of the RICCS cross-correlation data was then used to determine the effect of the V229A substitution on receptor oligomerisation before and after exendin-4 stimulation (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). Both WT and V229A receptors existed predominantly as monomers or dimers at a proportion of ∼60 to 80% of total receptors, a percentage that was reduced for the WT receptor at later acquisition times under vehicle conditions, but with otherwise few changes following exendin-4 stimulation. Around 30% of inactive WT or V229A receptors existed as dimers to hexamers or hexamers to decamers, with a tendency for the dimer to hexamer population to reduce and the hexamer to decamer population to increase after exendin-4 stimulation, and for GLP-1R V229A to have a higher proportion of hexamers to decamers under vehicle conditions <italic>versus</italic> WT receptors. A smaller proportion of receptors existed as higher order oligomers, with a significant increase measured for the WT GLP-1R after stimulation with exendin-4. For the GLP-1R V229A, however, we observed a higher proportion of receptors pre-existing as higher order oligomers under vehicle conditions, with no further increases after exendin-4 stimulation, indicating that the mutant receptor has a higher clustering propensity in the inactive state. Consistent with this finding, GLP-1R V229A also presented with significantly increased levels of receptors segregated to lipid rafts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>) prior to exendin-4 stimulation <italic>versus</italic> GLP-1R WT (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>).</p>

<p>To determine if the V229A substitution affected receptor recruitment to clathrin-coated pits (CCPs) after agonist stimulation, TIRF images were acquired of both unstimulated and exendin-4-stimulated INS-1 832/3 SNAP/FLAG-hGLP-1R WT <italic>versus</italic> V229A cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>). Before agonist addition, the SNAP/FLAG-hGLP-1R signal was distributed across the plasma membrane and only weakly associated with clathrin-positive regions (ΔF/S = 0.03 ± 0.003 and 0.04 ± 0.006 for WT and V229A, respectively), with no differences between WT and V229A receptors. However, after exendin-4 stimulation, the receptor association with clathrin-positive regions increased, an effect that correlates with the known rapid GLP-1R internalisation triggered by exendin-4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>), with this increase however significantly less pronounced for the GLP-1R V229A compared to WT (ΔF/S = 0.16 ± 0.006 and 0.10 ± 0.004 for WT <italic>versus</italic> V229A, respectively), in agreement with the reduced internalisation propensity displayed by this mutant receptor (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2H</xref>).</p>

<title>GLP-1R V229A substitution affects receptor trafficking, activation and signalling in pancreatic beta cells</title>

<p>Next, we performed NanoBiT complementation assays to determine the effect of the GLP-1R V229A substitution on receptor coupling to G proteins and β-arrestins, assessing mini-G<sup>s</sup>, mini-G<sub>q</sub>, and β-arrestin 2 recruitment dose response curves to WT <italic>versus</italic> V229A receptors after stimulation with a range of exendin-4 doses.

<p>To determine differences between GLP-1R WT and V229A beta cell downstream signalling, cAMP and insulin secretion responses to exendin-4 were investigated in INS-1 832/3 SNAP/FLAG-hGLP-1R WT and V229A. GLP-1R V229A displayed a tendency for increased exendin-4-induced cAMP AUC, with kinetic responses that appeared delayed but reached significantly higher maximal cAMP peak levels (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8A, B</xref>). Compared to WT receptor, GLP-1R V229A caused a significant decrease in basal insulin secretion under vehicle (11 mM glucose alone) conditions (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8C</xref>), which resulted in significantly increased insulin secretion fold-responses to exendin-4 (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8D</xref>). We then determined the effect of GLP-1R V229A in primary mouse islets. To this end, SNAP/FLAG-hGLP-1R WT or V229A-expressing adenoviruses were transduced into islets extracted from mice lacking endogenous GLP-1R expression (GLP-1R KO, generated <italic>in house</italic>). Similarly to the stable INS-1 832/3 sublines, there was no difference in surface expression of GLP-1R WT <italic>versus</italic> V229A in these islets (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8E</xref>, top row and <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">F</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we have focused on assessing the potential for modulation of cholesterol interactions as a strategy to control GLP-1R responses in pancreatic beta cells. We have first shown that exogenous cholesterol increases via prolonged dietary changes lead to a decrease in the capacity of the GLP-1R for <italic>in vivo</italic> glucoregulation, without affecting glucose levels under vehicle conditions. Further investigations showed that GLP-1R-mediated cAMP responses were reduced in islets extracted from these mice, suggesting that a high cholesterol diet specifically impacts on beta cell GLP-1R activity. Similarly, acute cholesterol increases in mouse islets exposed to cholesterol-loaded MβCD decreased the GLP-1R capacity to potentiate insulin secretion, validating our observed <italic>in vivo</italic> effects. In agreement with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>), acute (1 hour) beta cell exposure to high cholesterol leads to increased insulin secretion under 11 mM glucose conditions, but the GLP-1R is unable to further potentiate secretion to the same extent than with unmodified cholesterol levels.</p>
<p>While we have observed a direct detrimental effect of a cholesterol-enriched diet on islet GLP-1R cAMP outputs, we cannot rule out that the reduced receptor capacity to lower blood glucose levels following cholesterol loading might encompass further negative effects of high cholesterol on GLP-1R downstream signalling. Persistently elevated mouse islet cholesterol levels have been shown to cause a decrease in the expression of cholesterol synthesis genes (<italic>Hmgcr</italic>) and increased expression of steroidogenic acute and regulatory protein (StAR), while also decreasing glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>). StAR is a steroid biogenesis factor involved in cholesterol transport from the outer to the inner mitochondrial membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>) expressed at low levels in beta cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>), with increased StAR expression linked to reduced beta cell mitochondrial function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>). We (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>), and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>), have shown that the GLP-1R plays an important role in the control of beta cell mitochondrial function, a key process for optimal insulin secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>), with our recent interactome results unveiling direct interactions between GLP-1R and cholesterol biosynthesis and metabolism factors located at ER-mitochondria membrane contact sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>). It is therefore possible that high cholesterol might impact on the capacity of the GLP-1R to regulate mitochondrial and beta cell function via altered expression and interaction with cholesterol regulatory enzymes, hindering the insulin secretion potentiation effect of the receptor.</p>
<p>Conversely, in this study we also found that a reduction in mouse islet cholesterol levels with simvastatin, which disrupts ER cholesterol synthesis by inhibiting HMGCR enzymatic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>), increased exendin-4-mediated cAMP and insulin secretion responses. While this partial reduction in cholesterol levels appears beneficial for beta cell GLP-1R function, we previously observed that a much more drastic cholesterol extraction using MβCD leads to the opposite effect, inhibiting agonist-induced GLP-1R cAMP responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>), a result that we hypothesise is linked to the profound disruption of plasma membrane architecture caused by MβCD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>). The use of statins at higher concentrations than in the present study has been previously associated with varying effects on insulin secretion: simvastatin was shown to reduce, while pravastatin increased insulin secretion in response to glucose, with GLP-1 or exendin-4 exposure restoring secretory responses from statin-treated cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>). Statin use has been associated with increased risk of T2D by poorly understood mechanisms involving both reduced insulin sensitivity and impaired beta cell insulin secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>), the latter ameliorated by GLP-1R agonist exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>). Considering our results as well as previous literature, we speculate that patients with increased cholesterol levels might also exhibit reduced beta cell responses to incretin therapies unless dyslipidaemia is subsequently ameliorated following weight loss. In addition, patients taking cholesterol modifying drugs like statins are particularly good candidates for incretin use as they might present with improved incretin responses that would also help prevent a potentially increased risk of developing T2D in this patient subset.</p>
<p>The GLP-1R, as an integral membrane protein and 7-TMD GPCR, tightly interacts with its lipid-rich plasma membrane microenvironment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>) and is also known to segregate to cholesterol-rich flotillin-positive lipid nanodomains upon activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>). It is therefore plausible that direct interaction of cholesterol molecules with specific binding pockets in the GLP-1R might at least be partially responsible for cholesterol modulation of GLP-1R function. To test this possibility, we performed cgMD simulations of GLP-1R in active <italic>versus</italic> inactive conformations in a model mammalian plasma membrane using the latest Martini 3 forcefield and cholesterol parameters, identifying specific receptor sites with high cholesterol occupancies and residence times. The fact that the highest cholesterol occupancy residues identified correspond to either ring-containing (Phe) or branched (Val, Leu, Ile) amino acids suggests that these residue types might play important roles in cholesterol stabilisation at GLP-1R binding pockets. Importantly, the GLP-1R-cholesterol binding sites identified here do not overlap with previously predicted cholesterol consensus motifs (CCM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>) or Cholesterol Recognition Amino Acid Consensus (CRAC) motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>) identified for other GPCRs, confirming the theory that GPCRs lack predictable primary sequence consensus motifs for cholesterol binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>). The GLP-1R-cholesterol binding sites also presented notable differences between active and inactive receptor conformations, suggesting that cholesterol binding is regulated by agonist binding and receptor activation. GLP-1R in its inactive apo-state is constantly moving but prefers to adopt a closed ECD conformation in absence of peptide binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>). Active, peptide-bound receptors, on the other hand, adopt a more open conformation resulting from the peptide agonist interacting with the ECD, leading to prominent changes at TMD regions which stabilise G protein binding and activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>). The conformational shift between the receptor in active and inactive states is therefore predicted to affect GLP-1R-cholesterol interactions, thereby leading to distinct active <italic>versus</italic> inactive cholesterol binding sites. Interestingly, one of the most prominent GLP-1R-cholesterol binding sites identified here lies within the functionally important TM5-TM6 region required for G protein signal transduction, indicating the potential impact of cholesterol binding on GLP-1R activation and downstream signalling.</p>
<p>To investigate the importance of direct cholesterol interactions in modulating beta cell GLP-1R function, we have screened 12 residues selected from the cholesterol binding sites identified in our cgMD simulations, covering a wide range of occupancy, residence time, ability to tolerate the planned mutation, and varied locations within binding sites in active <italic>versus</italic> inactive states. Interestingly, the residues that had significant effects on GLP-1R internalisation while mutated to alanine were all non-polar branched amino acids, with some of these also predicted to cause changes in the cavity in which they reside. Specifically, changing the Val229 residue to alanine, selected in this study for further investigation, was predicted to trigger a change in the cavity and a buried exposure switch at the inactive receptor, thereby potentially modifying the interactions between itself and other pocket residues with cholesterol.</p>
<p>Further detailed investigations of GLP-1R V229A behaviours in beta cells revealed an overall reduction in cholesterol binding under vehicle conditions, which correlated with reduced lateral diffusion, average displacement, and speed of movement across the plasma membrane of the V229A receptor under these conditions. Detailed examination of the receptor oligomerisation state using N&amp;B also demonstrated a greater population of higher order oligomers under vehicle conditions for the V229A <italic>versus</italic> WT GLP-1R. RICS lateral diffusion takes into consideration the movement of molecules in regions of interest within cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>); the reduced lateral diffusion of GLP-1R V229A could therefore be due to the mutant receptor existing as a subpopulation of pre-clustered, higher order oligomeric assemblies in absence of agonist stimulation, predicted to cause a decrease in the movement of these clusters and potentially hinder cholesterol binding. Interestingly, GLP-1R V229A also presented with a higher tendency to segregate to cholesterol- and sphingolipid-rich flotillin-positive lipid nanodomains, or lipid rafts, in the apo-state, so that the increased clustering of GLP-1R V229A could potentially be triggered by increased mutant receptor partitioning to these lipid nanodomains. This observation also highlights the complexity that modifying a residue within a cholesterol binding site might have on the overall pattern of receptor interactions with cholesterol and other plasma membrane lipids, as increased segregation to cholesterol-rich lipid rafts occurs despite an overall reduction in total cholesterol binding under vehicle conditions observed for the V229A mutant receptor.</p>
<p>GLP-1R V229A receptor pre-clustering under vehicle conditions did not however trigger any measurable changes in the lateral diffusion of the lipid dye Laurdan, which allows for the detection of different plasma membrane organisation states as either liquid ordered or disordered nanodomains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>). Laurdan is a non-species-specific lipid probe that cannot discriminate between different lipids at the plasma membrane so that its lateral diffusion would represent the movement of other lipids besides cholesterol, hence potentially explaining the lack of effect on its lateral diffusion by expression of the mutant <italic>versus</italic> WT receptors. We nevertheless observed, by RICCS analysis, a tendency for reduced co-diffusion of Laurdan with GLP-1R V229A under vehicle conditions, an effect normally only present in stimulated conditions for WT receptor, with no further change after agonist stimulation observed for the V229A mutant, suggesting a different pattern of interaction of V229A <italic>versus</italic> WT GLP-1R with plasma membrane lipids.</p>
<p>Underscoring the importance that direct cholesterol engagement has in the modulation of GLP-1R function, the changes in cholesterol binding and plasma membrane behaviours introduced by the V229A substitution led to significant effects on GLP-1R trafficking and signalling in beta cells: V229A caused a decrease in GLP-1R recruitment to CCPs and receptor internalisation, accompanied by an increase in Gα<sub>s</sub> (measured with mini-G<sub>s</sub>) and β-arrestin 2 engagement, as well as increased plasma membrane recycling following exendin-4 stimulation. Overall, the V229A receptor presented with biased signalling favouring Gα<sub>s</sub> coupling over β-arrestin 2 recruitment and receptor localisation and activation at the plasma membrane. GLP-1R biased signalling also occurs in WT receptors following activation with modified peptide agonists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>). For example, biased GLP-1R signalling is observed following stimulation with exendin-phe1, which carries a phenylalanine substitution at position 1 of exendin-4, causing a similar reduction in receptor internalisation and increased plasma membrane recycling to GLP-1R V229A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>). In contrast, however, exendin-phe1 triggers essentially no β-arrestin 2 recruitment to the receptor, as well as prolonged GLP-1R-induced cAMP and insulin secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>), together with reduced GLP-1R clustering and lipid raft recruitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>), while GLP-1R V229A presents with increased oligomerisation at vehicle conditions and acute effects on beta cell function (summarised in <xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9</xref> and <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Some of these effects are in fact analogous to those previously observed by reducing beta cell/islet cholesterol with simvastatin: for example, both manipulations led to a reduction in GLP-1R plasma membrane lateral diffusion under vehicle conditions, as well as acute increases in GLP-1R-induced cAMP and islet insulin secretion responses. Taken together, these results indicate that modulation of direct GLP-1R-cholesterol interactions is a valid strategy to fine-tune beta cell incretin receptor responses, providing a new avenue for further investigation of novel ways to improve GLP-1R signalling outputs.</p>

<p>The phenomenon of cholesterol modification of GPCR outputs by direct receptor binding has been previously demonstrated for other GPCR classes, especially class A GPCRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref>). For example, cholesterol binding sites were identified in the adenosine A<sub>2A</sub> receptor; mutation of residues within the predicted receptor-cholesterol binding sites caused changes in basal receptor activity, ligand binding, G protein coupling and cAMP responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>). Receptor-cholesterol interactions were also affected by either agonist or antagonist binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>). Similarly, determining the effect that different agonists and/or antagonists might have on GLP-1R-cholesterol interactions might also provide further valuable insights into their specific mechanisms of action.</p>
<p>Our results serve as a first for a class B1 GPCR, highlighting the importance of GPCR-lipid interactions on receptor function and dynamics for this receptor class. It further confirms cholesterol binding pockets as high value sites for GLP-1R allosteric modulation, with the capacity to fine-tune GLP-1R trafficking, signalling and functional outputs. Further investigations to fully elucidate the effect of the V229A substitution on GLP-1R-cholesterol interactions might include detailed atomistic MD simulations of WT <italic>versus</italic> V229A receptors, as well as resolving cryo-EM structures of mutant and WT receptors in nanodiscs containing relevant lipid compositions to preserve receptor-lipid interactions in their native environment. Large cgMD simulations including increased numbers of WT or mutant receptors in a membrane environment with varying cholesterol levels could also be performed to determine the effect of cholesterol on GLP-1R oligomerisation. Finally, further high-throughput investigations to evaluate all other key residues involved in GLP-1R-cholesterol binding will generate high value data for the future development of novel GLP-1R allosteric modulators with improved signalling properties for the treatment of T2D and obesity.</p>

Urea buffer (2X) was added in a 1:1 ratio and samples incubated for 10 minutes at 37°C prior to 10% SDS-PAGE gel separation and imaging using a ChemiDoc MP imaging system to detect fluorescently labelled cholesterol. The proteins were then transferred onto a PVDF membrane and corresponding SNAP/FLAG-hGLP-1R levels detected by Western blotting with an anti-SNAP antibody (P9310S, New England Biolabs). Data was represented as amount of bound Photo-Click cholesterol relative to SNAP/FLAG-hGLP-1R.</p>

<p>pGEX-KG-D4H*-mCherry plasmid (Addgene #134604) was used to purify D4H*-mCherry as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>). Briefly, a plasmid colony was grown in 5 mL LB broth overnight at 37°C. Culture was scaled up into a 1 L flask and grown for a further 4 hours, and protein production induced with 0.5 mM IPTG for 4 hours. Bacterial culture was pelleted at 2,500 rpm for 30 minutes and resuspended in lysis buffer (0.1 M NaCl, 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mM DTT, 1X protease inhibitor cocktail) and 0.35 mg/mL lysozyme added for 30 minutes on ice. Samples were sonicated at 50% Amp for 10 seconds and 10 seconds break for a total of 4 minutes. 1% Triton X-100 was added, and samples rocked at 4°C for 30 minutes before centrifugation and incubation of supernatants with glutathione beads (GE17-0756-01, Sigma Aldrich) for 2 hours rocking at room temperature to capture the GST-D4H*-mCherry protein. D4H*-mCherry protein was eluted in elution buffer (25 mM L-glutathione, 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.8, 200 mM NaCl), filtered through a 30 kDa centrifugal filter unit (UFC203024, Thermo Fisher Scientific) and stored at -80°C.</p>

Cells were washed with PBS and imaged in RMPI 1640 medium without phenol red using the confocal settings of a Leica Stellaris 8 STED FALCON in an 86X objective and a 10% power 405 nm excitation laser and emission ranges of 415-465 nm and 470-520 nm for Laurdan, plus a 5% power 647 nm excitation laser for SNAP-Surface Alexa Fluor 647. Two hundred consecutive frames were captured for 2.45 minutes at a pixel size of 80 nm and a format size of 256×256pixels. Cells were imaged under vehicle conditions and after stimulation with 100 nM exendin-4.

<p>INS-1 832/3 SNAP/FLAG-hGLP-1R WT or V229A cells were transfected with clathrin light chain (CLC)-GFP and plated onto poly-L-lysine-coated glass coverslips. Prior to imaging, cells were labelled at 37°C with 5 μM SNAP-Surface 549 probe for 30 minutes in full media and washed. Microscopy was performed on a custom-built TIRF microscope based on a Zeiss Axiovert 135 with DPSS lasers at 405, 491 and 561 nm, 100X/1.45 NA objective. Colour channels were split using a Dualview (Optical Insights) and projected side by side onto an EMCCD camera (QuantEM:512SC, Photometrics). Still images were acquired by sequential excitation with the 473 and 561 nm lasers. During the experiments, cells were incubated in an imaging solution containing 138 mM NaCl, 5.6 mM KCl, 2.6 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1.2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 3 mM glucose and 5 mM HEPES, pH 7.4 at ∼35°C. Exendin-4 (100 nM) was added for at least 10 minutes to trigger receptor endocytosis. Calibration and alignment were performed using 100 nm polystyrene beads (Molecular Probes). To quantify SNAP/FLAG-hGLP-1R association with clathrin, circular ROIs surrounding individual well defined puncta of fluorescence (5-50 per cell) were selected on CLC-GFP images and transferred to the corresponding SNAP ones using a Fiji macro and average fluorescence per pixel was measured in a central circle (c) of diameter 5 pixels (0.55 µm) at each puncta location, in a surrounding annulus (a) with an outer diameter of 7 pixels (0.77 µm), and in an area not containing any cell as background (bg). The specific cluster-associated fluorescence ΔF was calculated by subtracting the annulus value from that of the circle (ΔF = c-a). Local fluorescence from CLC-GFP molecules not associated with the cluster site was calculated by subtracting the background from the annulus value (S = a-bg) and used to normalize ΔF to the expression level of the tested protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">90</xref>).

Surface receptor probe was cleaved by incubation in 100 mM 2-mercaptoethane-sulfonic acid sodium salt (Mesna) in 1X TAE buffer, pH 8.6 or incubated 1X TAE buffer alone for 5 minutes and then washed and imaged in HBSS using a custom-written high content analysis software in Micro-Manager in a Cairn Research widefield microscope with Nikon Ti2, CoolLED light source and 20X phase contrast objective for both epifluorescence and transmitted phase contrast with 9 ROI acquired per well. Phase contrast images, analysed using PHANTAST in Fiji, were used to determine the cell containing region, and BaSiC was used for illumination correction of fluorescent images. Mean intensity for the cell containing region was determined using a custom macro by Steven Rothery, Imperial College London FILM Facility. SNAP/FLAG-hGLP-1R internalisation was calculated by first subtracting non-specific signal of wells treated with Mesna without agonist from all the other wells, then normalising to signal of cells with no Mesna exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c92">92</xref>).</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors demonstrate impairments induced by a high cholesterol diet on GLP-1R dependent glucoregulation in vivo as well as an improvement after reduction in cholesterol synthesis with simvastatin in pancreatic islets. They also map sites of cholesterol high occupancy and residence time on active versus inactive GLP-1Rs using coarse-grained molecular dynamics (cgMD) simulations and screened for key residues selected from these sites and performed detailed analyses of the effects of mutating one of these residues, Val229, to alanine on GLP-1R interactions with cholesterol, plasma membrane behaviour, clustering, trafficking and signalling in pancreatic beta cells and primary islets, and describe an improved insulin secretion profile for the V229A mutant receptor.</p>
<p>These are extensive and very impressive studies indeed. I am impressed with the tireless effort exerted to understand the details of molecular mechanisms involved in the effects of cholesterol for GLP-1 activation of its receptor. In general the study is convincing, the manuscript well written and the data well presented. Some of the changes are small and insignificant which makes one wonder how important the observations are. For instance in figure 2 E (which is difficult to interpret anyway because the data are presented in percent, conveniently hiding the absolute results) does not show a significant result of the cyclodextrin except for insignificant increases in basal secretion. That is not identical to impairment of GLP-1 receptor signaling!</p>
<p>To me the most important experiment of them all is the simvastatin experiment, but the results rest on very few numbers and there is a large variation. Apparently, in a previous study using more extensive reduction in cholesterol the opposite response was detected casting doubt on the significance of the current observation. I agree with the authors that the use of cyclodextrin may have been associated with other changes in plasma membrane structure than cholesterol depletion at the GLP-1 receptor. The entire discussion regarding he importance of cholesterol would benefit tremendously from studies of GLP-1 induced insulin secretion in people with different cholesterol levels before and after treatment with cholesterol-lowering agents. I suspect that such a study would not reveal major differences.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this manuscript the authors provided a proof of concept that they can identify and mutate a cholesterol-binding site of a high-interest class B receptor, the GLP-1R, and functionally characterize the impact of this mutation on receptor behavior in the membrane and downstream signaling with the intent that similar methods can be useful to optimize small molecules that as ligands or allosteric modulators of GLP-1R can improve the therapeutic tools targeting this signaling system.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The majority of results on receptor behavior are elucidated in INS-1 cells expressing the wt or mutant GLP-1R, with one experiment translating the findings to primary mouse beta-cells. I think this paper lays a very strong foundation to characterize this mutation and does a good job discussing how complex cholesterol-receptor interactions can be (ie lower cholesterol binding to V229A GLP-1R, yet increased segregation to lipid rafts). Table 1 and Figure 9 are very beneficial to summarize the findings. The lower interaction with cholesterol and lower membrane diffusion in V229A GLP-1R resembles the reduced diffusion of wt GLP-1R with simv-induced cholesterol reductions, although by presumably decreasing the cholesterol available to interact with wt GLP-1R. This could be interesting to see if lowering cholesterol alters other behaviors of wt GLP-1R that look similar to V229A GLP-1R. I further wonder if the authors expect that increased cholesterol content of islets (with loading of MβCD saturated with cholesterol or high-cholesterol diets) would elevate baseline GLP-1R membrane diffusion, and if a more broad relationship can be drawn between GLP-1R membrane movement and downstream signaling.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>I think there are no obvious weaknesses in this manuscript and overall, I believe the authors achieved their aims and have demonstrated the importance of cholesterol interactions on GLP-1R functioning in beta-cells. I think this paper will be of interest to many physiologists who may not be familiar with many of the techniques used in this paper and the authors largely do a good job explaining the goals of using each method in the results section. The intent of some methods, for example the Laurdan probe studies, are better expanded in the discussion. I found it unclear what exactly was being measured to assess 'receptor activity' in Fig 7E and F.</p>
<p>Certainly many follow-up experiments are possible from these initial findings and of primary interest is how this mutation affects insulin homeostasis in vivo under different physiological conditions. One of the biggest pathologies in insulin homeostasis in obesity/t2d is an elevation of baseline insulin release (as modeled in Fig 1E) that renders the fold-change in glucose stimulated insulin levels lower and physiologically less effective. No difference in primary mouse islet baseline insulin secretion was seen here but I wonder if this mutation would ameliorate diet-induced baseline hyperinsulinemia.</p>
<p>I would have liked to see the actual islet cholesterol content after 5wks high-cholesterol diet measured to correlate increased cholesterol load with diminished glucose-stimulated inulin. While not necessary for this paper, a comparison of islet cholesterol content after this cholesterol diet vs the more typical 60% HFD used in obesity research would be beneficial for GLP-1 physiology research broadly to take these findings into consideration with model choice.</p>
<p>Another area to further investigate is does this mutation alter ex4 interaction/affinity/time of binding to GLP-1 or are all of the described findings due to changes in behavior and function of the receptor?</p>
<p>Lastly, I wonder if V229A would have the same impact in a different cell type, especially in neurons? How similar are the cholesterol profiles of beta-cells and neurons? How this mutation (and future developed small molecules) may affect satiation, gut motility, and especially nausea, are of high translational interest. The comparison is drawn in the discussion between this mutation and ex4-phe1 to have biased agonism towards Gs over beta-arrestin signaling. Ex4-phe1 lowered pica behavior (a proxy for nausea) in the authors previously co-authored paper on ex4-phe1 (PMID 29686402) and I think drawing a parallel for this mutation or modification of cholesterol binding to potentially mitigate nausea is worth highlighting.</p>

<p>We assume that the reviewer refers to Fig. 1E, where we show the percentage of insulin secretion in response to 11 mM glucose +/- exendin-4 stimulation in mouse islets pretreated with vehicle or MβCD loaded with 20 mM cholesterol. While we concur with the reviewer that the effect in this case is triggered by increased basal insulin secretion at 11 mM glucose, exendin-4 can no longer compensate for this increase by proportionally amplifying insulin responses in cholesterol-loaded islets, leading to a significantly decreased exendin-4-induced insulin secretion fold increase under these circumstances, as shown in Fig. 1F. We interpret these results as a defect in the GLP-1R capacity to amplify insulin secretion beyond the basal level to the same extent as in vehicle conditions. An alternative explanation is that there is a maximum level of insulin secretion in our cells, and 11 mM glucose + exendin-4 stimulation gets close to that value. With the increasing effect of cholesterol-loaded MβCD on basal secretion at 11 mM glucose, exendin-4 stimulation appears as working less well. A simple experiment to rule out this possibility would be to test insulin secretion following KCl stimulation under these conditions to determine if maximal stimulation has been reached or not. We will perform this control experiment in the revised manuscript to clarify this point. We will also include absolute insulin results as well as percentages of secretion to improve the completeness of the report.</p>

<p>We agree with the reviewer that the insulin secretion results in vehicle <italic>versus</italic> LPDS/simvastatin treated mouse islets (Fig. 1H, I) are relatively variable and we therefore plan to perform further biological repeats of this experiment for the paper revision to consolidate our current findings.</p>

<p>We agree with the reviewer that such study would be highly relevant. While this falls outside the scope of the present paper, we encourage other researchers with access to clinical data on GLP-1RA responses in individuals taking cholesterol lowering agents to share their results with the scientific community. We will highlight this point in the paper discussion to emphasise the importance of more research in this area.</p>

<p>Membrane diffusion experiments are difficult to perform in intact islets as our method requires cell monolayers for RICS analysis. We do however agree that it would be interesting to perform further RICS analysis in INS-1 832/3 SNAP/FLAG-hGLP-1R cells pretreated with vehicle or MβCD loaded with 20 mM cholesterol, and we will therefore add this experiment to the paper revisions.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>To clarify the intent of the Laurdan experiments early in the manuscript, we will add the following text to the methods section in the paper revisions: “Laurdan, 6-dodecanoyl-2-dimethylaminonaphthalene (product D250) was purchased from ThermoFisher.  Laurdan (40 μM) was excited using a 405 nm solid state laser and SNAP/FLAG-hGLP-1R labelled with SNAP-Surface Alexa Fluor 647 with a pulsed (80 MHz) super-continuum white light laser at 647 nm. Laurdan emission was recorded in the ranges of 420–460 nm (IB) and 470–510 nm (IR), and the general polarisation (GP) formula (GP = IB-IR/IB+IR) used to retrieve the relative lateral packing order of lipids at the plasma membrane. Values of GP vary from 1 to −1, where higher numbers reflect lower fluidity or higher lateral lipid order, whereas lower numbers indicate increasing fluidity.”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>I found it unclear what exactly was being measured to assess 'receptor activity' in Fig 7E and F.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Figs. 7E and F refer to bystander complementation assays measuring the recruitment of nanobody 37 (Nb37)-SmBiT, which binds to active Gas, to either the plasma membrane (labelled with KRAS CAAX motif-LgBiT), or to endosomes (labelled with Endofin FYVE domain-LgBiT) in response to GLP-1R stimulation with exendin-4. This assay therefore measures GLP-1R activation specifically at each of these two subcellular locations. We will add a schematic of this assay to the methods section in the paper revisions to clarify the aim of these experiments.</p>
