<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Diverse chemical modifications fine-tune the function and metabolism of tRNA. Although tRNA modification is universal in all kingdoms of life, profiles of modifications, their functions, and physiological roles have not been elucidated in most organisms including the human pathogen, <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (<italic>Mtb</italic>), the causative agent of tuberculosis. To identify physiologically important modifications, we surveyed the tRNA of <italic>Mtb</italic>, using tRNA sequencing (tRNA-seq) and genome-mining. Homology searches identified 18 candidate tRNA modifying enzymes that are predicted to create 13 tRNA modifications across all tRNA species. Reverse transcription-derived error signatures in tRNA-seq predicted the sites and presence of 9 modifications. Several chemical treatments prior to tRNA-seq expanded the number of predictable modifications. Deletion of <italic>Mtb</italic> genes encoding two modifying enzymes, TruB and MnmA, eliminated their respective tRNA modifications, validating the presence of modified sites in tRNA species. Furthermore, the absence of <italic>mnmA</italic> attenuated <italic>Mtb</italic> growth in macrophages, suggesting that MnmA-dependent tRNA uridine sulfation contributes to <italic>Mtb</italic> intracellular growth. Our results lay the foundation for unveiling the roles of tRNA modifications in <italic>Mtb</italic> pathogenesis and developing new therapeutics against tuberculosis.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>tRNA is an adaptor molecule that enables protein synthesis by converting the triplet genetic code in mRNA into amino acids. The fidelity of base paring between mRNA codons and tRNA anticodons is monitored within ribosomes and is critical for properly incorporating the amino acids bound to the 3’ ends of tRNAs into growing polypeptides. For optimal translation, the abundances, and properties of tRNA isoacceptors are fine-tuned by diverse mechanisms, including chemical modifications[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>] Dysregulation of tRNA abundance and/or structure leads to defective decoding and results in ribosome pausing and collisions, protein misfolding, stress responses and can have detrimental or lethal effects on the cell[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>].</p>
<p>Chemical modifications of tRNA (tRNA modifications) are found in all kingdoms of life and fine-tune tRNA properties including mRNA decoding efficiency, recognition by aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, half-life and structural stability[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>]. Modifications are prevalent in the anticodon loop, particularly at the first letter of the anticodon. Modifications of the anticodon loop directly modulate codon recognition, whereas modifications in the tRNA body region primarily stabilize tRNA tertiary structure, protecting them from degradation in the cell. tRNA modifications are generated by dedicated site-specific enzymes referred to as tRNA modifying enzymes. tRNA modifications have been extensively characterized in a few model organisms[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>], but their profiles, regulation, and functions in non-model organisms, including bacterial pathogens, are understudied[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>]</p>
<p>tRNA sequencing (tRNA-seq) allows for the rapid and systematic prediction of many tRNA modification sites[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>]. We recently developed a comparative tRNA-seq protocol to profile tRNA modifications in organisms with uncharted tRNA modification profiles; in <italic>Vibrio cholerae</italic>, this approach led to the discovery of a new RNA modification and RNA editing process[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>]. tRNA-seq enables rapid prediction of modified sites through detection of reverse transcription-derived signatures, such as nucleotide misincorporation and early termination, both of which occur more frequently at modified sites. Furthermore, several chemical treatments of tRNA can convert modifications that are not recognizable as reverse transcription-derived signatures into detectable signals, expanding the repertoire of modifications that can be distinguished by tRNA-seq[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>].</p>
<p><italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (<italic>Mtb</italic>), the agent of tuberculosis (TB), is a global pathogen that caused &gt;10.5 million cases and over 1.5 million deaths worldwide in 2020[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>]. Several studies have uncovered roles for non-<italic>Mtb</italic> mycobacterial tRNA modifications in stress responses, adaptation to environmental changes, and persister formation[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>]. <italic>Mycobacterium bovis</italic> BCG, an organism closely related to <italic>Mtb</italic>, responds to hypoxia by reprogramming 40 ribonucleoside modifications in tRNA to facilitate translation of a subset of proteins that promote survival in hypoxic conditions[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>]. To date, studies of the profiles and functions of <italic>Mtb</italic> tRNA modifications have been limited.</p>
<p>Here, we conducted tRNA-seq in <italic>Mtb</italic>. We assigned modifications to many of the reverse transcription-derived signatures identified, using information on the presence of homologs of known modifying enzymes in <italic>Mtb</italic>. Chemical treatments of tRNAs carried out prior to tRNA-seq increased the detectability of certain modifications. We constructed two <italic>Mtb</italic> deletion mutant strains, with deletions of <italic>mnmA</italic> and <italic>truB</italic>, and confirmed that the absence of these modification enzymes eliminated the predicted signals in tRNA-seq data. Furthermore, while deletion of <italic>mnmA</italic> in <italic>Mtb</italic> did not affect the pathogen’s growth in <italic>in vitro</italic> laboratory growth conditions, the <italic>mnmA</italic> knockout strain’s growth was attenuated in a macrophage infection model. Our findings suggest that tRNA modifications warrant further study as we unravel the complexity of <italic>Mtb</italic> infections, as they may serve as targets for new therapeutics.</p>

<title><italic>In silico</italic> prediction of <italic>Mtb</italic> tRNA modifying enzymes</title>
<p>To predict tRNA modifications in <italic>Mtb</italic>, we used Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>] to identify homologues of all tRNA modification enzymes registered in Modomics in the <italic>Mtb</italic> genome[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>]. With a stringent threshold (E-value &lt;1×10<sup>−10</sup>), 20 <italic>Mtb</italic> genes homologous to genes encoding known RNA modification enzymes were identified. 18 of these genes are predicted to synthesize 13 tRNA modifications in <italic>Mtb</italic> (Supplementary Table 1), including <italic>miaA</italic> and <italic>miaB</italic> for 2-methylthio-6-isopentenyl-adenosine (ms<sup>2</sup>i<sup>6</sup>A), <italic>tsaD, tsaB, tsaE</italic>, and <italic>sua5</italic> for <italic>N</italic><sup>6</sup> threonylcarbamoyladenosine (t<sup>6</sup>A), <italic>mnmA</italic> for 2-thiouridine (s<sup>2</sup>U), <italic>truB, truA</italic>, and <italic>pus9</italic> for pseudouridine (Ψ), <italic>trmD</italic> for 1-methylguanosine (m <sup>1</sup>G), <italic>trmI</italic> for 1-methyladenosine (m<sup>1</sup>A), <italic>trmL</italic> for 2’-<italic>O</italic>-methylcytidine (Cm) or 2’-<italic>O</italic>-methyluridine (Um), <italic>trmB</italic> for 7-methylguanosine (m<sup>7</sup>G), <italic>trmH</italic> for 2’-<italic>O</italic>-methylguanosine (Gm), <italic>dusB</italic> for dihydrouridine (D), <italic>tadA</italic> for inosine (I), and <italic>tilS</italic> for lysidine (k<sup>2</sup>C). While two additional genes, Rv1713 and Rv2338c, met the threshold for homology to modification enzymes, they exhibited greater similarity to a ribosome associated GTPase (Der) and a molybdopterin biosynthesis protein (MoeW) respectively, and likely do not correspond to tRNA modification enzymes.</p>
<p>We mined data from genome-wide Tn-seq and CRISPRi screens[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>] to assess the impacts of <italic>Mtb</italic> tRNA modifications on its growth. Five genes encoding <italic>Mtb</italic> tRNA modifying enzymes, <italic>trmD, tilS, tadA, sua5</italic>, and <italic>miaA</italic>, were reported to be essential for <italic>Mtb</italic> growth in both Tn-seq[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>] and CRISPRi screens[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>] (Supplementary Table 1), suggesting that the modifications they produce are critical for tRNA functions. Indeed, <italic>E. coli trmD, tilS, tadA, and sua5</italic> are also essential for growth and critical for codon decoding, aminoacylation, and reading frame maintenance[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>]. The <italic>Mtb</italic> modifications synthesized by these enzymes likely have similar impacts on tRNA functions. Unexpectedly, one modifying enzyme, MiaA, is non-essential in <italic>E. coli</italic>, but apparently essential in <italic>Mtb</italic>, suggesting that i<sup>6</sup>A, the modification introduced by MiaA, may have more profound roles in <italic>Mtb</italic> translation than in <italic>E. coli</italic>.</p>
<p>Several of the putative <italic>Mtb</italic> tRNA modifying enzymes are conserved across all three domains of life (e.g., TruB and TsaD) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). By contrast, some enzymes were limited to bacterial species closely related to <italic>Mtb</italic>, possibly suggesting their species-specific physiological roles, including pathogenesis. For example, TrmI (Rv2118c) homologs are widely present in Archaea and Eukaryotes, but are sparsely distributed in bacteria, where they are primarily limited to Actinomycetia, including <italic>Mtb</italic>, and several thermophilic bacterial species (e.g., <italic>Thermus thermophilus</italic>). TrmI synthesizes m<sup>1</sup>A at position 58 in eukaryotes[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>] and at position 57/58 in archaea[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>]; indeed, TrmI in <italic>Mtb</italic> has been proven to generate m<sup>1</sup>A at position 58[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>]. Pus9 (Rv3300c) has many homologs exhibiting weak similarity across eukaryotes and bacteria. However, some species, including <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Neisseria gonorrhoeae</italic>, and several species of Actinomycetia, encode proteins showing strong homology to <italic>Mtb</italic> Pus9, suggesting that this set of pseudouridylases have a distinctive property such as substrate specificity.</p>

<title>Profiling <italic>Mtb</italic> tRNA modification sites by tRNA sequencing</title>
<p>To begin profiling detectable <italic>Mtb</italic> tRNA modifications, we sequenced tRNAs isolated from wild type <italic>Mtb</italic> strain H37Rv grown in 7H9 medium. In this protocol, tRNAs are first reversed transcribed to cDNA[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>]. During cDNA synthesis, chemical modifications on tRNA nucleotides disrupt Watson-Crick base pairing and increase the frequency of reverse transcriptase errors, leading to incorporation of the incorrect nucleotide or early termination of cDNA synthesis[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>]. These reverse transcription derived ‘signatures’ typically correspond to modified sites[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>] and are depicted in the heat map in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>.</p>

</fig>
<p>Comparison of the reverse transcription derived signatures observed in <italic>Mtb</italic> to <italic>E. coli</italic>, in which tRNA modifications are previously well characterized[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>] enables the prediction of the presence of common modifications, including ms<sup>2</sup>i<sup>6</sup>A, m<sup>1</sup>G, I, and k<sup>2</sup>C (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>). These predictions are strongly supported by the set of tRNA modification enzymes identified in the <italic>Mtb</italic> genome (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> and Supplementary Table 1), including <italic>miaA</italic> and <italic>miaB</italic> (ms<sup>2</sup>i<sup>6</sup>A), <italic>trmD</italic> (m<sup>1</sup>G), <italic>tadA</italic> (I), and <italic>tilS</italic> (k<sup>2</sup>C). Some tRNA modifications were observed in <italic>Mtb</italic> but are not present in <italic>E. coli</italic>. In other actinobacteria, A58 and A59 are likely modified to m<sup>1</sup>A[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>], and since <italic>trmI</italic>, the methylase that generates this modification is present in <italic>Mtb</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>], most <italic>Mtb</italic> tRNAs likely contain this modification as well. Nucleoside variation in the sequence of tRNA genes can account for some of the variations in modified sites between <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>Mtb</italic>. For example, in <italic>Mtb</italic>, termination signatures derived from G at position 37 were detected in tRNA-Arg2, -Gln1, and -Gln2, whereas this position in these tRNAs in <italic>E. coli</italic> are modified A, such as m<sup>2</sup>A and m<sup>6</sup>A, which are silent in tRNA-seq. Since m<sup>1</sup>G induces strong termination during reverse transcription, these positions are likely modified to m<sup>1</sup>G, as observed in the <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> tRNA-Arg2 gene position 37 G[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>].</p>
<p>tRNA samples were also treated with several chemical treatments prior to sequencing, to expand the set of tRNA modifications detectable by tRNAseq. These treatments included iodoacetamide (IAA), for detection of sulfur modifications,1-cyclohexyl-(2-morpholinoethyl) carbodiimide (CMC) for detection of Ψ, and alkali for detection of D and m<sup>7</sup>G. The chemical treatment protocols were first carried out with <italic>E. coli</italic>, to validate the methods.</p>
<p>IAA is a thiol-reactive compound that covalently attaches carboxyamidomethyl to thiolated uridines via nucleophilic substitution[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>] and modified s<sup>4</sup>U is detected as C instead of U. In IAA-treated samples, position 8 and 9, corresponding to s<sup>4</sup>U in many tRNA species, had high misincorporation frequencies, confirming that IAA treatment modifies s<sup>4</sup>U, leading to elevated misincorporation (Supplementary Fig. 1). Furthermore, we observed higher misincorporation and termination signals at the positions corresponding to other sulfur modification, s<sup>2</sup>C, s<sup>2</sup>U and their derivatives, such as position 32 in tRNA-Arg3, -Arg5, -Ser3, and Arg4, and 34 in tRNA-Glu, -Gln1, and -Lys (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> and Supplementary Fig. 1), revealing that IAA treatment facilitates the detection of not only s<sup>4</sup>U but also additional sulfur modifications, which are weakly detected without the IAA treatment.</p>

<p>Next, we applied IAA treatment to <italic>Mtb</italic> tRNA-seq. IAA treatment increased termination signals from position 34 in tRNA-Glu1, -Gln1, and -Lys, which contain s<sup>2</sup>U derivatives in <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>). The 2-thiouridine modification is carried out by MnmA in <italic>E. coli</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>], and a homolog, <italic>Rv3024c</italic>, of this enzyme was identified in the <italic>Mtb</italic> genome (Supplementary Table 1)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>]. We used double stranded DNA-based recombineering to delete Rv3024c in <italic>Mtb</italic>, yielding strain <italic>MtbΔmnmA</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>]. Sequencing of tRNA isolated from <italic>MtbΔmnmA</italic> with prior IAA treatment showed reduced termination signals from position 34 in tRNA-Glu1, -Gln1, and -Lys in treated samples, indicating that Rv3024c plays a critical role in the modification responsible for increased termination frequency derived from position 34 in these tRNAs (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). Together, these observations strongly suggest that Rv3024c encodes an MnmA-like enzyme that sulfurates position 34 uridines in three <italic>Mtb</italic> tRNA isoacceptors.</p>

<p>As shown previously[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>], CMC treatment increased both misincorporation and termination signatures at a subset of Ψs in <italic>E. coli</italic> tRNAs (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5</xref>, and Supplementary Fig. 2 and 3). In addition, CMC-treated samples showed increased frequencies of both misincorporation and termination at position 16, 17, 20, and 20A corresponding to D, and m<sup>7</sup>G at position 46. Both modifications are known to undergo base elimination in mild alkali conditions[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>]. Since these signals were also observed in the reaction condition in which CMC was not added, these signals are likely attributable to the alkali treatment that is common to both conditions.</p>

<p>Reverse transcription-derived signatures derived from alkali-treated D showed a distinctive pattern. With this treatment, when two Ds are at consecutive positions, e.g., D16 and D17, termination signals were elevated at the following position (Supplementary Fig. 2 and 4). Furthermore, alkali treatment also led to higher misincorporation frequencies at singlet Ds (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> and Supplementary Fig. 4). Thus, termination and misincorporation signatures enabled the prediction of known <italic>E. coli</italic> tRNA sites modified to D.</p>
<p>CMC/alkali treatment facilitated the identification of additional modifications in <italic>Mtb</italic> tRNAs. Regardless of CMC treatment, alkali treated samples showed increased misincorporation and termination frequencies derived from U located at position 16, 17, 20, and 20A (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref> and Supplementary Fig. 5). As observed in <italic>E. coli</italic>, termination signals at position 18 and 21 likely correspond to consecutive Ds at position 16 and 17, and 20 and 20A, respectively. <italic>Mtb</italic> Rv0823c is a homolog of dihydrouridylase DusB (Supplementary Table 1), which likely accounts for the synthesis of D at these positions. Furthermore, alkali treatment increased the misincorporation frequencies at G at position 46 (Supplementary Fig. 6). Since Rv0208c is a homolog of TrmB, which synthesizes m<sup>7</sup>G at position 46 in <italic>E. coli</italic>, multiple <italic>Mtb</italic> tRNA species likely contain m<sup>7</sup>G at position 46 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref> and Supplementary Fig. 6).</p>

<p>CMC treatment also increased the termination frequency at several sites. Termination signatures derived from position 55 increased in most tRNA species, suggesting that <italic>Mtb</italic> tRNAs contain pseudouridines at this position[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>]. Rv2793c is an <italic>Mtb</italic> homologue of <italic>E. coli</italic> TruB and deletion of Rv2793c reduced the termination frequencies at this position in tRNAs isolated from <italic>MtbΔtruB</italic> (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref> and Supplementary Fig. 7)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>]. Together, these observations suggest that Rv2793c encodes a TruB-like enzyme that modifies position 55 uridines to Ψ across tRNA species. Furthermore, the presence of a TruA homolog in <italic>Mtb</italic> (Rv3455c) suggests that in multiple tRNA species U at positions 38-40 can be modified to Ψ. Indeed, the termination signatures derived from positions 38 and 39 increased depending on CMC treatment, strongly suggesting that these positions are modified to Ψ (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref> and Supplementary Fig. 7).</p>
<p>In total, among 13 tRNA <italic>Mtb</italic> tRNA modifications predicted by the presence of tRNA modifying enzymes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref> and Supplementary Table 1), 9 species of modifications were detected based on reverse-transcription derived signatures (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>).</p>

<title>Growth of <italic>Mtb</italic>Δ<italic>mnmA</italic> is attenuated in a macrophage infection model</title>
<p>To address whether <italic>Mtb</italic> tRNA modifications impact the pathogen’s growth in the host environment, we used the MtbTnDB transposon insertion sequencing (Tn-seq) database[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>] to determine if transposon insertions in genes encoding tRNA modifying enzymes have been associated with <italic>in vivo</italic> growth defects.

We found that the growth of WT and <italic>MtbΔmnmA</italic> were similar in 7H9 medium (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>), suggesting the absence of s<sup>2</sup>U modification at position 34 does not impair <italic>Mtb</italic> growth in culture.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Here, we profiled <italic>Mtb</italic> tRNA modifications with tRNA sequencing to provide the first maps of the tRNA modification landscape in this global pathogen. In total, nine modifications, including six modifications without chemical treatment, were identified based on reverse transcription derived signatures. CMC/alkali treatment and IAA treatment further identified Ψ and m<sup>7</sup>G and sulfur modifications, respectively. Although we did not chemically validate the modifications predicted by tRNA-seq with mass spectrometry, the identification of <italic>Mtb</italic> homologs of tRNA modifying enzymes strongly bolsters the RT-signature-based predictions. Furthermore, the deletion of <italic>truB</italic> and <italic>mnmA</italic> genes in <italic>Mtb</italic> eliminated the respective modification signatures of pseudouridine and s<sup>2</sup>U, validating that the enzymes encoded by these genes synthesize these modifications. Finally, the growth defect of the Δ<italic>mnmA</italic> strain within macrophages but not in a nutrient-rich medium suggests that s<sup>2</sup>U tRNA modification facilitates <italic>Mtb</italic> adaptation to the host intracellular environment.</p>
<p>IAA treatment was developed for detecting s<sup>4</sup>U modification in pulse-chase experiments to measure RNA turnover[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>]. We found that this treatment enhances the RT-signatures of additional sulfur modifications as well, including s<sup>2</sup>C and s<sup>2</sup>U, indicating that IAA should have general utility in tRNA-seq-based profiling of sulfur modifications, including in studies tracking changes in tRNA sulfuration[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>].</p>
<p>Multiple modifications do not cause reverse transcriptase errors. Although tRNA-seq provides a simple and rapid method for profiling the landscape of modifications in all tRNA species, this approach does not enable comprehensive identification of modifications. Here, several modifications, including t<sup>6</sup>A, Cm, Um, and Gm, predicted by the presence of <italic>Mtb</italic> homolog of tRNA modifying enzymes, such as Sua5, TsaB, TsaD, TsaE, TrmL, and TrmH, were not detected in tRNA-seq. Mapping and further analysis of these modifications will require different approaches such as tRNA purification and RNA mass spectrometric analysis.</p>
<p>Several strong signatures were detected in <italic>Mtb</italic> tRNAs but not in <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>), including G45 in tRNA-Gly2. Most of these signals are strict misincorporations of C or T at A or G position, respectively. Since modifications at a purine position, e.g., m<sup>1</sup>G and m <sup>1</sup>A, generally cause random misincorporation of the other three nucleosides, strong <italic>Mtb</italic>-specific misincorporation signatures are not likely to be derived from modification. Further mass spectrometric analysis of purified tRNAs will be necessary to assess whether these signals are derived from <italic>Mtb</italic>-specific modifications.</p>
<p>The role of s<sup>2</sup>U in <italic>Mtb</italic> appears to be unusual. s<sup>2</sup>U is a universally conserved modification observed in all three domains of life at the wobble position in the anticodon. This modification enhances the stacking of s<sup>2</sup>U with U35 to stabilize the anticodon structure, facilitating codon-anticodon interactions. s<sup>2</sup>U is also recognized by multiple aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases for efficient amino acylation[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>]. Although elimination of this sulfur modification causes severe growth phenotypes in most organisms[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>], unexpectedly, the deletion of <italic>mnmA</italic> in <italic>Mtb</italic> did not attenuate growth of the pathogen <italic>in vitro</italic>, suggesting that the <italic>Mtb</italic> requirement for s<sup>2</sup>U modification differs from other organisms. The marked growth retardation of Δ<italic>mnmA</italic> strain within macrophages indicates the specific requirement of this modification within host cells. This modification may be necessary for maintaining general translation efficiency inside host cells and/or facilitate the expression of specific genes that are necessary for survival within macrophages.</p>
<p>In most organisms, s<sup>2</sup>U is further modified into derivatives containing an additional chemical moiety at position 5[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>]. However, <italic>Mtb</italic> does not contain apparent homologs of the tRNA modifying enzymes that introduce the additional modifications to s<sup>2</sup>U. Thus, <italic>Mtb</italic> may contain s<sup>2</sup>U or s<sup>2</sup>U derivatives synthesized by other types of enzymes. Additional analyses to elucidate the structures of modified s<sup>2</sup>U in <italic>Mtb</italic> are warranted.</p>
<p>Our findings serve as a valuable starting point for the research community to continue characterizing the physiological roles and mechanisms of <italic>Mtb</italic> tRNA modifications. Since tRNA-seq offers an efficient and scalable platform for surveying changes in tRNA modifications, this approach will be valuable across growth conditions, and may be extended to growth inside host cells. Finally, further studies elucidating the mechanisms by which tRNA modifications facilitate <italic>Mtb</italic> growth in host cells should be valuable for designing new therapeutics for tuberculosis.</p>

<p>This is a <bold>valuable</bold> addition to the literature as it helps us understand the role of tRNA modifying enzymes in Mycobacterium tuberculosis. By knocking out one of the enzymes, the authors <bold>convincingly</bold> demonstrate the importance of tRNA-modifying enzymes for intra-host growth of tubercle bacteria. Some of the claims regarding modification as well as the role in virulence could be strengthened through further bioinformatics and phylogenetic analyses as well as experimental approaches. The work will be of interest to microbiologists.</p>

<p>Tomasi et al. performed a combination of bioinformatic, next-generation tRNA sequencing experiments to predict the set of tRNA modifications and their corresponding genes in the tRNAs of the pathogenic bacteria Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Long known to be important for translation accuracy and efficiency, tRNA modifications are now emerging as having regulatory roles. However, the basic knowledge of the position and nature of the modifications present in a given organism is very sparse beyond a handful of model organisms. Studies that can generate the tRNA modification maps in different organisms along the tree of life are good starting points for further studies. The focus here on a major human pathogen that is studied by a large community raises the general interest of the study. Finally, deletion of the gene mnmA responsible for the insertion of s2U at position 34 revealed defects in in growth in macrophage but in test tubes suggesting regulatory roles that will warrant further studies. The conclusions of the paper are mostly supported by the data but the partial nature of the bioinformatic analysis and absence of Mass-Spectrometry data make it incomplete. The authors do not take advantage of the Mass spec data that is published for Mycobacterium bovis (PMID: 27834374) to discuss what they find.</p>
<p>Important points to be considered:</p>
<p>1. The authors say they took a list of proteins involved in tRNA modifications from Modomics and added manually a few but we do not know the exact set of proteins that were used to search the M. mycobacterium genome.</p>
<p>2. The absence of mnmGE genes in TB suggested that the xcm5U derivatives are absent. These are present in M. bovis (PMID: 27834374). Are the MnmEG gene found in M. bovis? If yes, then the authors should perform a phylogenetic distribution analysis in the Mycobacterial clade to see when they disappeared. If they are not present in M. bovis then maybe a non-orthologous set of enzymes do the same reaction and then the authors really do not know what modification is present or not at U34 without LC-MS. The exact same argument can be given for the xmo5U derivatives that are also found in M.bovis but not predicted by the authors in M. tuberculosis.</p>
<p>3. Why is the Psi32 predicted by the authors because of the presence of the Rv3300c/Psu9 gene not detected by CMC-treated tRNA seq while the other Psi residues are? Members of this family can modify both rRNA and tRNA. So the presence of the gene does not guarantee the presence of the modification in tRNAs</p>
<p>4. What are tsaBED not essential but tsaC (called sua5 by the authors) essential?</p>

<p>In this study, Tomasi et al identify a series of tRNA modifying enzymes from Mtb, show their function in the relevant tRNA modifications and by using at least one deleted strain for MnmA, they show the relevance of tRNA modification in intra-host survival and postulate their potential role in pathogenesis.</p>
<p>Conceptually it is a wonderful study, given that tRNA modifications are so fundamental to all life forms, showing their role in Mtb growth in the host is significant. However, the authors have not thoroughly analyzed the phenotype. The growth defect aspect or impact on pathogenesis needs to be adequately addressed.</p>
<p>- The authors show that ΔmnmA grows equally well in the in vitro cultures as the WT. However, they show attenuated growth in the macrophages. Is it because Glu1_TTC and Gln1-TTG tRNAs are not the preferred tRNAs for incorporation of Glu and Gln, respectively? And for some reason, they get preferred over the alternate tRNAs during infection? What dictates this selectivity?</p>
<p>- As such the growth defect shown in macrophages would be more convincing if the authors also show the phenotype of complementation with WT mnmA.</p>
<p>An important consideration here is the universal nature of these modifications across the life forms. Any strategy to utilize these enzymes as the potential therapeutic candidate would have to factor in this important aspect.</p>

<p>The work presented in the manuscript tries to identify tRNA modifications present in Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) using reverse transcription-derived error signatures with tRNA-seq. The study identified enzyme homologs and correlates them with presence of respective tRNA modifications in Mtb. The study used several chemical treatments (IAA and alkali treatment) to further enhance the reverse transcription signals and confirms the presence of modifications in the bases. tRNA modifications by two enzymes TruB and MnmA were established by doing tRNA-seq of respective deletion mutants. Ultimately, authors show that MnmA-dependent tRNA modification is important for intracellular growth of Mtb. Overall, this report identifies multiple tRNA modifications and discuss their implication in Mtb infection.</p>
<p>Important points to be considered:</p>
<p>- The presence of tRNA-based modifications is well characterised across life forms including genus Mycobacterium (Mycobacterium tuberculosis: Varshney et al, NAR, 2004; Mycobacterium bovis: Chionh et al, Nat Commun, 2016; Mycobacterium abscessus: Thomas et al, NAR, 2020). These modifications are shown to be essential for pathogenesis of multiple organisms. A comparison of tRNA modification and their respective enzymes with host organism as well as other mycobacterium strains is required. This can be discussed in detail to understand the role of common as well as specific tRNA modifications implicated in pathogenesis.</p>
<p>- Authors state in line 293 &quot;Several strong signatures were detected in Mtb tRNAs but not in E. coli&quot;. Authors can elaborate more on the unique features identified and their relevance in Mtb infection in the discussion or result section.</p>
<p>- Deletion of MnmA is shown to be essential for E. coli growth under oxidative stress (Zhao et al, NAR, 2021). In similar lines, MnmA deleted Mtb suffers to grow in macrophage. Is oxidative stress in macrophage responsible for slow Mtb growth?</p>
<p>- Authors state in line 311-312 &quot;Mtb does not contain apparent homologs of the tRNA modifying enzymes that introduce the additional modifications to s2U&quot;. This can be characterised further to rule out the possibility of other enzyme specifically employed by Mtb to introduce additional modification.</p>

<p>The reviewer raises a valid point. In M. bovis mnm5U and cmo5U derivatives were observed in LC-MS analysis. However, we did not identify candidate genes known to be involved in the biogenesis of mnm5U and cmo5U in the Mycobacteriaceae, including M. bovis and Mtb, suggesting that if these modifications are indeed present, they are not synthesized through a canonical biogenesis pathways in this family. There are several examples where the same modification is generated by distinct modification enzymes (Kimura, 2021). These observations raise the interesting possibility that in the Mycobacteriaceae and most species in actinomycetota (except for Bifidobacterium, Corynebacterium and Rhodococcus species), major wobble modifications are generated by biosynthesis pathways that are distinct from those employed by well-characterized organisms. Future studies will examine this hypothesis.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you very much for the careful read. We did not include RluA in the list of query proteins because it is not classified as a tRNA modification enzyme in Modomics. Additionally, the CMC-coupled tRNA-seq is imperfect for detection of all pseudouridylated positions. Due to this limitation, we only assigned modifications that are both predicted by the presence of putative biosynthetic enzymes and RT-derived signatures. As the reviewer points out, we cannot rule out that this homolog targets only rRNAs. We will clarify this possibility in the revised manuscript. Also, RluA will be added to the query and the name of Rv3300c will be changed to RluA in the text and related figures.</p>

<p>1. What are tsaBED not essential but tsaC (called sua5 by the authors) essential?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for pointing out this interesting observation. We are also curious about differences in the essentiality among t6A biogenesis genes. We speculate that TsaC potentially has critical roles in cell viability other than t6A synthesis. TsaC synthesizes a compound, threonylcarbamoyl-AMP, as an intermediate for t6A biogenesis. Thus, it is possible that this intermediate has a role in other essential cellular activities besides t6A biogenesis. Further study of these factors in Mtb could reveal interesting crosstalk between modification synthesis and other cellular activities.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you very much for raising this excellent point. As the reviewer suggests, the attenuation of DmnmA Mtb growth inside of macrophages could be caused by disparate codon usage between genes required for in vitro growth and intracellular growth. Among multiple codons encoding Glu, Gln, or Lys, s2U modification-dependent codons might be preferentially distributed in genes associated with intracellular growth. For example, Mtb has two tRNA isoacceptors, Glu1_TTC and Glu2_CTC, to decipher two Glu codons, i.e., GAA and GAG. According to the wobble pairing rule, GAA is only decoded by Glu1_TTC, whereas GAG is decoded by both Glu1_TTC and Glu2_CTC; i.e., GAG can be deciphered by an s2U-independent tRNA. Thus, genes required for intracellular growth might be enriched with GAA, an s2U-dependent codon. The same thing can happen to other Gln and Lys codons deciphered by s2U-containing tRNAs. In the revised manuscript, we will include the perspective of codon usage for explaining the intracellular fitness defect of the ΔmnmA Mtb mutant.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>- As such the growth defect shown in macrophages would be more convincing if the authors also show the phenotype of complementation with WT mnmA.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The reviewer raises a valid point. We note however, that Rv3023c, a putative transposase, is downstream of MnmA and unlike MnmA, Rv3023c appears to be dispensable for in vivo growth, according to the Tn-seq database. Therefore, it is likely that the intracellular growth defect is caused by loss of mnmA.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>An important consideration here is the universal nature of these modifications across the life forms. Any strategy to utilize these enzymes as the potential therapeutic candidate would have to factor in this important aspect.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This is a valid point. Targeting a pathogen-specific system enables avoidance of the adverse side effects caused by many therapeutic reagents. There are a couple of Mtb modification enzymes that are specific to bacteria and critical for Mtb fitness (e.g., TilS). These enzymes represent ideal potential therapeutic targets to suppress Mtb intracellular growth.</p>

<p>The reviewer raises a fair point. However, with the exception of Chionh et al., the other studies cited here are not genome-wide characterization of tRNA modification. We will add a discussion of the distribution of tRNA modification enzymes across multiple mycobacterium species and the implications of this distribution for pathogenesis to the revised manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">

<p>Thank you for the suggestion. We will lengthen the discussion of the RT-derived signatures observed in Mtb but not in E. coli but the relevance of these modifications for Mtb pathogenicity remains speculative at this point.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>The reviewer raises a valid point. As discussed above (Reviewer #1, pt 2), Mtb may employ distinct enzymes to generate certain tRNA modifications. Future mass spec-based analyses of Mtb tRNAs will be carried out to identify the precise chemical structure of the sulfurated uridine, and subsequent studies will attempt to determine the enzymes that account for the biogenesis of these modifications.</p>
