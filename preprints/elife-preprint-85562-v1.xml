<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Cancer treatments such as chemotherapy can have gonadotoxic effects. In order to preserve and restore the fertility of prepubertal patients with cancer, testicular biopsies are frozen and could theoretically be later matured <italic>in vitro</italic> to produce spermatozoa for assisted reproductive technology. A complete <italic>in vitro</italic> spermatogenesis has been obtained from prepubertal testicular tissue in the mouse model, although the sperm yield was low. Since steroid hormones play an essential role in spermatogenesis, it appears necessary to ensure that their synthesis and mechanisms of action are not altered in <italic>in vitro</italic> cultured tissues. The aim of this study was therefore to investigate steroidogenesis as well as androgen and estrogen signaling during <italic>in vitro</italic> maturation of mouse prepubertal testicular tissues.</p><p>Histological, RT-qPCR, Western blot analyses, measurements of cholesterol, steroid hormones levels and aromatase activity were performed on fresh or frozen/thawed <italic>in vitro</italic> cultured mouse testicular tissues from 6.5 days <italic>postpartum</italic> (d<italic>pp</italic>) mice as well as on age-matched <italic>in vivo</italic> controls.</p><p>A similar density of Leydig cells (LC) was found after 30 days of organotypic culture (D30) and at 36.5 d<italic>pp</italic>, the corresponding <italic>in vivo</italic> time point. However, LC were partially mature after <italic>in vitro</italic> culture, with decreased <italic>Sult1e1</italic> and <italic>Insl3</italic> mRNA levels (adult LC markers). Moreover, the transcript levels of <italic>Cyp11a1</italic>, <italic>Cyp17a1</italic> and <italic>Hsd17b3</italic> encoding steroidogenic enzymes were decreased <italic>in vitro</italic>. Increased amounts of progesterone and estradiol and reduced androstenedione intratesticular levels were observed at D30. Furthermore, androgen signaling was altered at D30, with decreased transcript levels of androgen target genes (<italic>Rhox5</italic>, <italic>Septin12</italic>). Moreover, the expression and activity of aromatase and estrogen signaling were impaired at D30. The addition of hCG to the organotypic culture medium induced an elevation in androgen production but did not improve sperm yield.</p><p>In conclusion, this study reports partial LC maturation, disturbed steroidogenic activity of LC, abnormal steroid hormone content as well as altered androgen and estrogen signaling in cultures of fresh and frozen/thawed prepubertal mouse testicular tissues. The organotypic culture system will need to be further improved to increase the efficiency of <italic>in vitro</italic> spermatogenesis and allow a clinical application.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Pediatric cancer treatments such as chemotherapy have recognized toxicity on germline stem cells, which could lead to infertility at adulthood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>]. In order to preserve and restore male fertility, fragments of prepubertal testicular tissue are frozen and could theoretically be later matured to produce spermatozoa for assisted reproductive technology procedures. So far, fertility restoration approaches have not been clinically validated. <italic>In vitro</italic> maturation strategies are currently being developed and optimized in animal models. <italic>In vitro</italic> spermatogenesis could indeed be proposed to patients with testicular localization of residual tumor cells, for whom testicular tissue autografting is not indicated (about 30% of patients with acute leukemia). The organotypic culture procedure, which preserves testicular tissue architecture, microenvironment and cell interactions, has been used successfully to obtain spermatozoa from fresh or frozen/thawed mouse prepubertal testicular tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>]. In addition, viable and fertile mice have been obtained from <italic>in vitro</italic> produced spermatozoa by oocyte microinjection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>].</p>
<p>It has been previously shown that supplementing organotypic culture media with 1 μM retinol improves the <italic>in vitro</italic> production of spermatids and spermatozoa in prepubertal mouse testicular tissues cultured at a gas-liquid interphase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>]. However, <italic>in vitro</italic> sperm production still remains a rare event. A decreased expression of the androgen receptor (AR)-regulated gene <italic>Rhox5</italic> at the end of the culture period was evidenced, suggesting that testosterone production by Leydig cells (LC) and/or AR transcriptional activity could be impaired in organotypic cultures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>]. A decline in intratesticular testosterone levels has been highlighted during the first wave of mouse <italic>in vitro</italic> spermatogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>]. Apart from that, whether LC maturation and functionality are affected in organotypic cultures has been poorly explored so far.</p>
<p>LC populations that differentiate during the prenatal and postnatal period are identified as Fetal Leydig cells (FLC) and Adult Leydig cells (ALC), respectively. Although FLC and ALC commonly express the majority of steroidogenic proteins required for androgen production, such as steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR), P450 side chain cleavage (CYP11A1), 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3β-HSD) and P450 17α-hydroxylase/C17-20 lyase (CYP17A1), several genes are differentially expressed in the two LC populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>]. Notably, 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 3 (17β-HSD3), an enzyme involved in the last step of testosterone biosynthesis, is expressed only by ALC, and not by FLC. Consequently, the major androgens produced in FLC and ALC are androstenedione and testosterone, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>].</p>
<p>In rodents, the ALC lineage can be divided into four distinct stages: stem, progenitor, immature and adult [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>]. Stem Leydig cells (SLC) express stem cell markers but do not express the LC lineage biomarkers, such as LHCGR, StAR or 3β-HSD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>]. Progenitor Leydig cells (PLC) are morphologically similar to the undifferentiated SLC but express LC markers, such as the steroidogenic enzymes CYP11A1 and CYP17A1 and do not express 17β-HSD3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>]. However, PLC express high levels of androgen metabolizing enzymes, 5α-reductase 1 (SRD5A1) and 3α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3α-HSD) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>]. The differentiation of SLC into PLC is induced by the pituitary gonadotropin LH (Luteinizing Hormone) and by IGF1 (Insulin-like Growth Factor 1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>]. Then, the activities of CYP11A1, 3β-HSD, and CYP17A1 increase in immature Leydig cells (ILC) as they mature from PLC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>]. ILC begin to express 17β-HSD3 and therefore can synthetize testosterone from androstenedione [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>]. However, ILC still have high levels of SRD5A1 and 3α-HSD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>]. Adult Leydig cells (ALC) have increased expression of CYP11A1, 3β-HSD, CYP17A1, and 17β-HSD3. At this stage, SRD5A1 and 3α-HSD expression being silenced [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>], testosterone is the major androgen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>]. ALC also express and secrete high levels of INSL3 under the regulation of AR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>]. Furthermore, ALC express specifically SULT1E1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>], which protects LC and seminiferous tubules against estrogen overstimulation by catalyzing the sulfoconjugation and inactivation of estrogens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>]. The proliferation and differentiation of the LC lineage are regulated by different factors, such as DHH and IGF1. DHH is required for both proliferation and differentiation of SLC into ALC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>]. IGF1 stimulates the proliferation of PLC and ILC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>] and promotes the maturation of ILC into ALC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>].</p>
<p>The steroid hormones produced by LC are essential for the progression of spermatogenesis. Testosterone, synthesized under the control of LH, is involved in spermatogonial proliferation and differentiation, meiotic progression, spermiogenesis and germ cell survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>]. Androgen-binding protein (ABP), produced by Sertoli cells under the regulation of FSH, increases the accumulation of androgens in the seminiferous epithelium and makes them available for binding to intracellular AR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>]. Estrogens, derived from the aromatization of androgens by CYP19A1 (aromatase) in somatic and germ cells, regulate spermatogonial proliferation as well as spermatocyte and spermatid apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>]. The expression of aromatase is age-dependent, being mostly in Sertoli cells in immature rodent testes and then in LC during adulthood. In mouse, aromatase is also present within seminiferous tubules, mainly in spermatids. The expression of this enzyme is enhanced by the pituitary gonadotropins FSH and LH and its activity is stimulated by LH and its homologue hCG (human Chorionic Gonadotropin) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>].</p>
<p>Androgens and estrogens act locally on somatic and/or germ cells expressing their receptors (AR and ERα, ERβ, GPER, respectively) to regulate the expression of target genes. <italic>Septin12</italic>, encoding a filament forming protein present in the acrosome, is a direct target gene of testosterone in post-meiotic germ cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>], but also of estrogens, with 2 ERα and 1 AR binding sites in its promoter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>]. <italic>Rhox5</italic>, encoding a transcription factor involved in germ cell survival, and <italic>Eppin</italic>, encoding a serine protease inhibitor, are two other target genes of testosterone in Sertoli cells, with androgen response elements (ARE) in their promoters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>]. <italic>Faah</italic>, encoding a hydrolase that protects Sertoli cells from apoptosis, is a direct target gene of estrogens in mature Sertoli cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>]. Its promoter activity engages ERβ and the histone demethylase LSD1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>].</p>
<p>Since steroid hormones play an essential role in the progression of spermatogenesis, it appears necessary to ensure that their syntheses and mechanisms of action are not altered in <italic>in vitro</italic> cultured testicular tissues. The aim of the present work was therefore to study LC maturation, steroidogenesis and androgen/estrogen signaling in a comprehensive manner during the <italic>in vitro</italic> maturation of mouse prepubertal testicular tissues.</p>

<title>Mice and testis collection</title>
<p>CD-1 mice (Charles River Laboratories, L’Arbresle, France) were housed in a temperature-controlled room (22–23°C) under a 12-h light/dark cycle. Prepubertal 6.5-day <italic>postpartum</italic> (d<italic>pp</italic>) male mice were euthanized by decapitation and underwent a bilateral orchidectomy. Testes were transferred to Petri dishes containing α-MEM without phenol red (Gibco by Life Technologies, Saint-Aubin, France) and the complete removal of the tunica albuginea was performed with two needles under a binocular magnifier (S8AP0, Leica Microsystems GmbH, Wetzlar, Germany). Testes were then either cultured immediately (culture from fresh tissues), or after a freezing/thawing cycle (<bold>S1 Fig</bold>). Moreover, mice aged 22.5 and 36.5 d<italic>pp</italic> were euthanized by CO<sub>2</sub> asphyxiation and their testes were used as <italic>in vivo</italic> controls for 16 and 30 days of culture, respectively (<bold>S1 Fig</bold>).</p>

<sec id="s2c">
<title>Controlled slow freezing (CSF) and thawing of testicular tissues</title>
<sec id="s2c1">
<title>Freezing procedure</title>
<p>Testes were placed into cryovials (Dominique Dutscher, Brumath, France) containing 1.5 mL of the following cryoprotective medium: Leibovitz L15 medium (Eurobio, Courtabœuf, France) supplemented with 1.5 M dimethylsulfoxyde (DMSO, Sigma-Aldrich, Saint-Quentin Fallavier, France), 0.05 M sucrose (Sigma-Aldrich), 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum (FCS, Life Technologies) and 3.4 mM vitamin E (Sigma-Aldrich) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>]. After a 30-min equilibration at 4°C, samples were frozen in a programmable freezer (Nano Digitcool, CryoBioSystem, L’Aigle, France) with a CSF protocol: start at 5°C, then −2°C/min until reaching −9°C, stabilization at −9°C for 7 min, then −0.3°C/min until −40°C and −10°C/min down to −140°C. Testicular tissues were then plunged and stored in liquid nitrogen.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2c2">
<title>Thawing procedure</title>
<p>Cryotubes were warmed for 1 min at room temperature (RT) and then for 3 min in a water bath at 30°C. They were then successively incubated at 4°C in solutions containing decreasing concentrations of cryoprotectants for 5 min each [solution 1: 1 M DMSO, 0.05 M sucrose, 10% FCS, 3.4 mM vitamin E, Leibovitz L15; solution 2: 0.5 M DMSO, 0.05 M sucrose, 10% FCS, 3.4 mM vitamin E, Leibovitz L15; solution 3: 0.05 M sucrose, 10% FCS, 3.4 mM vitamin E, Leibovitz L15; solution 4: 10% FCS, 3.4 mM vitamin E, Leibovitz L15].</p>

<title>Organotypic cultures at a gas–liquid interphase</title>
<p><italic>In vitro</italic> tissue cultures were performed as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>]. Briefly, prepubertal 6.5-day old mouse testes, which contain spermatogonia as the most advanced type of germ cells, were first cut into four fragments. They were placed on top of two 1.5% (w/v) agarose Type I gels (Sigma-Aldrich) half-soaked in medium. Testicular tissues were then cultured under 5% CO<sub>2</sub> at 34°C for 16 days (D16), which corresponds to the end of meiosis and the appearance of the first round spermatids, or 30 days (D30) to explore the end of the first spermatogenic wave. The basal medium (BM) contained α-MEM without phenol red, 10% KSR (KnockOut Serum Replacement, Gibco by Life Technologies), 0.1 mg/mL streptomycin and 100 UI/mL penicillin (Sigma-Aldrich). The medium was chosen without phenol red because of its estrogen activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>]. Retinol (10<sup>−6</sup> M, Sigma-Aldrich) is added in all organotypic cultures from D2 and then every 8 days in order to respect the meiosis entry cycle of spermatogonia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>]. Furthermore, the basal medium was supplemented or not with 1 nM hCG (MSD France, Courbevoie, France) from D16 in order to assess LC functionality. Media were prepared just before use and were replaced twice a week.</p>

<sec id="s2e">
<title>Histological analyses</title>
<sec id="s2e1">
<title>Tissue fixation, processing and sectioning</title>
<p>Testicular tissues were fixed with Bouin’s solution (Sigma-Aldrich) or 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA, Sigma-Aldrich) for 2 h at room temperature. They were then dehydrated in ethanol in the Citadel 2000 tissue processor (Shandon, Cheshire, UK) and embedded in paraffin. Tissue sections (3 μm thick) were prepared with the RM2125 RTS microtome (Leica) and were mounted on Polysine slides (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2e2">

<title>LC-MS/MS</title>
<p>The standards for androstenedione, testosterone, dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and their stable labeled isotopes were obtained from Merck. Working solutions were prepared in methanol. Serial dilutions from working solutions were used to prepare seven-point calibration curves and 3 quality control levels for all analytes. For the final calibration and quality control solutions, PBS was used for testicular fragments and α-MEM for medium. The linearity ranges were from 0.05 to 10 ng/mL for androstenedione and testosterone, and from 1 to 200 ng/mL for DHEA. A simple deproteinization was carried out by automated sample preparation system, the CLAM-2030 (Shimadzu Corporation, Marne-la-Vallée, France) coupled to a 2D-UHPLC-MS/MS system. Once the sample on board, 30 μL was automatically pipetted in a pre-conditioned tube containing a filter, in which reagents were added, then mixed and filtered. Briefly, the polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) filter vial (0.45 μm pore size) was previously conditioned with 20 μL of methanol (Carlo Erba, Val-de-Reuil, France). Successively, 30 μL of sample and 60 μL of a mixture of isotopically labeled internal standards in acetonitrile were added. The mixture was agitated for 120 s (1900 rpm), then filtered by application of vacuum pressure (−60 to −65 kPa) for 120 s into a collection vial. Finally, 30 μL of the extract was injected in the 2D-UHPLC-MS/MS system.</p>
<p>Analysis was performed on a two dimensions ultra-performance liquid chromatograph-tandem mass spectrometer (2D-UHPLC-MS/MS) consisting of the following Shimadzu® modules (Shimadzu Corporation): an isocratic pump LC20AD SP, for pre-treatment mode, a binary pump consisting of coupling two isocratic pumps Nexera LC30AD for the analytical mode, an automated sampler SIL-30AC, a column oven CTO-20AC and a triple-quadrupole mass spectrometer LCMS-8060. The assay was broken down into two stages. The first was the pre-treatment where the sample was loaded on the perfusion column. The second step was the elution of the compounds of interest to the analytical column. The deproteinized extract performed by the CLAM-2030 was automatically transferred to the automated sampler, where 30 μL was directly analyzed into the chromatographic system. The LC-integrated online sample clean-up was performed using a perfusion column Shimadzu® MAYI-ODS (5 mm L × 2 mm I.D.). The first step consisted of loading the extract on the perfusion column with a mobile phase composed of 10 mM ammonium formate in water (Carlo Erba) at a flow rate of 0.5 mL/min during 2 min. Then the system switched to the analytical step to elute the analytes from the perfusion column to the analytical column to achieve chromatographic separation. During this step, the loading line was washed with propan-2-ol (Carlo Erba) during 3 min. Chromatographic separation was achieved on a Restek<sup>®</sup> Raptor Biphenyl (50 mm L × 3 mm I.D., 2.7 μm) maintained at 40 °C and a gradient of (A) 1 mM ammonium fluoride buffer in water (Carlo Erba) and (B) methanol (Carlo Erba) at a flow rate of 0.675 mL/min as follows: 0.0–2.10 min, 5% (B); 2.1–3.0 min, 5 to 65% (B); 3.0–4.75 min, 65% (B); 4.75–5.0 min, 65 to 70% (B); 5.0–6.6 min, 70% (B); 6.6–8.0, 70 to 75% (B); 8.0–8.5 min, 75 to 100% (B); 8.50–9.5 min, 100% (B); 9.5–9.6 min, 100% to 5% (B); 9.6–12.0 min, 5% (B). Detection and quantification were performed by scheduled-Multiple Reaction Monitoring (MRM) using 1 ms pause time and 50 ms dwell times to achieve sufficient points per peak. The interface parameters and common settings were as follows: interface voltage: 1 kV; nebulizing gas flow: 3 L/min; heating gas flow: 10 L/min; drying gas flow: 10 L/min; interface temperature: 400 °C; desolvation line (DL) temperature: 150 °C; heat block temperature: 500 °C; collision gas pressure 300 kPa.

DHEA was below the detection limit (&lt;1 ng/mL) in all the samples examined (data not shown). The intratesticular concentrations of progesterone were significantly increased at D16 and D30 in both FT and CSF tissues compared to their respective <italic>in vivo</italic> controls (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3A</xref></bold>). In contrast, the intratesticular concentrations of androstenedione were significantly decreased at D16 in both FT and CSF tissues and at D30 in FT tissues compared to <italic>in vivo</italic> controls (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3B</xref></bold>). The intratesticular concentrations of testosterone were however not different in <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> matured tissues at both time points (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3C</xref></bold>). In addition, the intratesticular concentrations of estradiol were significantly higher at D16 and D30 in FT and CSF tissues than in their respective <italic>in vivo</italic> controls (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3D</xref></bold>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The present study shows for the first time and in a comprehensive manner that LC maturation and functionality as well as steroid hormone signaling are impaired in cultures of fresh and frozen/thawed immature mouse testes. Only few differences were found between fresh and frozen/thawed <italic>in vitro</italic> matured tissues.</p>
<p>A similar density of LC was found in organotypic cultures and in corresponding <italic>in vivo</italic> controls. However, LC only partially matured <italic>in vitro</italic>. At D16, the expression of the LC differentiation factors <italic>Igf1</italic> and <italic>Dhh</italic> was unaffected. At D30, the proliferation/apoptosis balance was undisturbed in LC while the expression of <italic>Insl3</italic> was faint, as well as that of <italic>Sult1e1</italic>, another LC maturity marker. The deficient LC maturation observed at D30 could be related to the decreased levels of <italic>Igf1</italic>, which encodes insulin-like growth factor 1 known to promote the maturation of ILC into ALC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>]. Indeed, the labeling index of ILC and ALC was previously found to be reduced in <italic>Igf1</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mouse testes between 21 and 56 d<italic>pp</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>].</p>
<p>LC functionality was also altered in organotypic cultures. Indeed, the expression of several genes encoding steroidogenic enzymes (<italic>Cyp11a1</italic>, <italic>Cyp17a1</italic>, <italic>Hsd17b3</italic>, <italic>Hsd17b2</italic>) was downregulated in these cells at D30 (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig 7</xref></bold>). Decreased <italic>Cyp11a1</italic> and <italic>Cyp17a1</italic> transcript levels were also previously reported in <italic>Igf1</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice, together with decreased intratesticular testosterone levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>]. Furthermore, deficiency in insulin-like growth factors signaling in <italic>Insr</italic><sup>−/−</sup>/<italic>Igf1r</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mouse LC was shown to impair testicular steroidogenesis (decreased <italic>Lhcgr</italic>, <italic>Star</italic>, <italic>Cyp11a1</italic>, <italic>Cyp17a1</italic>, <italic>Hsd17b3</italic>, <italic>Srd5a1</italic> and <italic>Insl3</italic> mRNA levels) and increase estradiol production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>]. Here, we report for the first time an accumulation of estradiol in <italic>in vitro</italic> cultured tissues, which could be deleterious for sperm production. To promote LC maturation and lower intratesticular estradiol levels <italic>in vitro</italic>, supplementation of culture medium with IGF1 could thus be later envisaged, and even more so since this factor has been shown to increase, although modestly, the percentages of round and elongated spermatids in cultured mouse testicular fragments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>]. To reduce estrogen levels and increase sperm production, supplementation of the organotypic culture medium with selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) such as tamoxifen or with aromatase inhibitors such as letrozole could also be considered in future studies. These molecules have indeed proven to be effective in increasing sperm concentration in infertile men [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>].</p>

<caption><title>Altered steroidogenesis and androgen/estrogen signaling pathways in <italic>in vitro</italic> matured testicular tissues of prepubertal mice</title>
<p>A similar density of Leydig cells (LC) is found after 30 days of organotypic culture (D30) and at 36.5 days <italic>postpartum</italic>, the corresponding <italic>in vivo</italic> time point. However, LC are partially mature <italic>in vitro</italic> with a decrease in <italic>Sult1e1</italic> and <italic>Insl3</italic> mRNA levels (adult LC markers). The mRNA levels of <italic>Cyp11a1</italic>, <italic>Cyp17a1</italic> and <italic>Hsd17b3</italic> encoding steroidogenic enzymes and the protein levels of CYP17A1 are decreased <italic>in vitro</italic>. Increased amounts of cholesterol, progesterone and estradiol and decreased androstenedione intratesticular levels are observed at D30. Furthermore, despite testosterone levels similar to <italic>in vivo</italic>, the expression of the androgen receptor (AR) and of the androgen binding protein (<italic>Abp</italic>), androgen signaling is altered at D30, with decreased transcript levels of androgen target genes (<italic>Rhox5</italic>, <italic>Septin12</italic>). Moreover, with severely decreased expression and activity of aromatase and decreased estrogen receptor expression, estrogen signaling is impaired at D30, leading to decreased transcript and protein levels of the estrogen target gene <italic>Faah</italic>.</p></caption>
<graphic xlink:href="517042v1_fig7.tif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/>
</fig>
<p>Our work also revealed an elevation in progesterone and a reduction in androstenedione in <italic>in vitro</italic> matured tissues (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig 7</xref></bold>), which could arise from the collapsed expression of <italic>Cyp17a1</italic>. A greater sperm production has been highlighted in PRKO mice (lacking the progesterone receptor), thereby showing the inhibitory action of progesterone on spermatogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>]. Furthermore, progesterone alone or in combination with estradiol can have inhibitory effects on spermatogenesis in rats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>]. The cumulative excess of progesterone and estradiol in cultured testicular tissues may therefore slow the progression of <italic>in vitro</italic> spermatogenesis and lead to a poor sperm yield.</p>
<p>Despite the disturbed steroidogenic activity of LC <italic>in vitro</italic>, the accumulation of estradiol and progesterone, the decrease in androstenedione, and in contradiction with a previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>], intratesticular testosterone levels in cultured tissues were not significantly different from <italic>in vivo</italic>. Moreover, a complete <italic>in vitro</italic> spermatogenesis was achieved, albeit with a low efficiency as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>]. We also found that the percentage of LC expressing AR was unchanged under <italic>in vitro</italic> conditions. The increased AR protein levels at D30 could thus be the result of the higher number of Sertoli cells within seminiferous tubules. Intriguingly, common points can be observed in our organotypic cultures and in LCARKO (LC-specific <italic>Ar</italic><sup>−/−</sup>) mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>]: decreased <italic>Insl3</italic>, <italic>Cyp17a1</italic> and <italic>Hsd17b3</italic> mRNA levels, increased intratesticular progesterone levels and unchanged intratesticular testosterone levels compared to <italic>in vivo</italic> controls. This could suggest that AR signaling is dysfunctional in LC <italic>in vitro</italic>. The downregulation of <italic>Rhox5</italic> expression (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig 7</xref></bold>), which confirms our previous findings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>], further suggests that AR signaling may also be impaired in Sertoli cells. Recently, in a mouse model with disrupted dimerization of the AR ligand-binding-domain, a decreased expression of <italic>Hsd17b3</italic> and of AR-regulated genes, such as <italic>Rhox5</italic> and <italic>Insl3</italic>, a higher percentage of Sertoli cells and a decreased production of round and elongated spermatids were found [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>], which further supports our hypothesis that AR signaling may be defective in organotypic cultures. In the SPARKI (SPecificity-affecting AR KnockIn)-AR mouse model, which has a defect in binding to AR-specific DNA motifs while displaying normal interaction with the classical androgen response elements (AREs), it has been shown that <italic>Rhox5</italic> expression is regulated by an AR-selective ARE, while <italic>Eppin</italic> expression is regulated by a classical, nonselective ARE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>]. The differential regulation of these two androgen-responsive genes could explain why <italic>Rhox5</italic> mRNA levels were downregulated while <italic>Eppin</italic> mRNA levels were upregulated in our cultures. We also report here that the transcript levels of <italic>Septin12</italic>, another androgen target gene, was reduced <italic>in vitro</italic> (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig 7</xref></bold>). As <italic>Septin12</italic> is expressed by post-meiotic germ cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>], the decrease of its expression may be the result of their low numbers in cultures.</p>
<p>Additionally, estrogen signaling was impaired in organotypic cultures, with a low expression of the estrogen-synthesizing enzyme aromatase, of estrogen receptors and of the estrogen target gene <italic>Faah</italic> (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig 7</xref></bold>). Since the expression of <italic>Cyp19a1</italic>, <italic>Esr1</italic> and <italic>Esr2</italic> (encoding aromatase, ERα and ERβ, respectively) can be downregulated by estradiol in the rat testis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>], we hypothesize that the transcription of these genes may be negatively controlled by elevated estradiol levels in our tissue cultures. <italic>Faah</italic>, whose promoter activity engages ERβ and the histone demethylase LSD1, is a direct target gene of estrogens in Sertoli cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>]. The <italic>Faah</italic> proximal promoter is not regulated by estrogen in immature Sertoli cells, as they express ERβ at the same level as mature cells but do not express LSD1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>]. Thus, the decreased <italic>Faah</italic> transcript levels in organotypic cultures could be the consequence of the downregulated ERβ expression and/or of the immaturity of Sertoli cells. Whether Sertoli cells in organotypic cultures are as mature as <italic>in vivo</italic> is unknown and will be the focus of future studies. The transcription of <italic>Insl3</italic>, which is repressed by estradiol in a MA-10 Leydig cell line model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>], could also be inhibited by the excess of estradiol in our tissue cultures. Interestingly, our <italic>in vitro</italic> cultured testes exhibit common features with the testes of <italic>Sult1e1</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice lacking estrogen sulfotransferase, an enzyme that catalyzes the sulfoconjugation and inactivation of estrogens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>]: decreased <italic>Cyp17a1</italic> expression as well as increased progesterone levels and local estrogen activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>]. The remaining question in our case is whether estrogen excess is the cause or the consequence of low <italic>Sult1e1</italic> expression.</p>
<p>Finally, as previously reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>], the presence of LH or its homologue hCG was not necessary to reconstitute a full first spermatogenic wave <italic>in vitro</italic>. However, plasma LH concentration is known to rise <italic>in vivo</italic> from 21-28 d<italic>pp</italic> in the mouse model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>]. We previously showed that the addition of 0.075 nM (50 IU/L) hCG together with FSH from D7 onwards modestly increased the number of spermatozoa produced in organotypic cultures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>]. To mimic as closely as possible the physiological conditions, 1 nM hCG was added in the culture medium from D16 onwards. Even though LC responded to this stimulation by synthesizing and secreting more androgens, supplementation of the culture medium with 1 nM hCG alone was not sufficient to increase the yield of <italic>in vitro</italic> spermatogenesis.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the present study shows the partial maturation and the disturbed steroidogenic activity of LC, the abnormal steroid hormone content as well as the altered androgen and estrogen signaling in organotypic cultures of fresh and frozen/thawed prepubertal mouse testicular tissues. Altogether, these defects could contribute to the low efficiency of <italic>in vitro</italic> spermatogenesis. Before clinical applications can be envisaged, the organotypic culture system will therefore have to be further optimized.</p>

<p>In this manuscript, the authors aimed to compare, from testis tissues at different ages from mice in vivo and after culture, multiple aspects of Leydig cells. These aspects included mRNA levels, proliferation, apoptosis, steroid levels, protein levels, etc. A lot of work was put into this manuscript in terms of experiments, systems, and approaches. However, as written the manuscript is incredibly difficult to follow. The Introduction and Results sections contain rather loosely organized lists of information that were altogether confusing. At the end of reading these sections, it was unclear what advance was provided by this work. The technical aspects of this work may be of interest to labs working on the specific topics of in vitro spermatogenesis for fertility preservation but fail to appeal to a broader readership.

<p>Preserving and restoring the fertility of prepubertal patients undergoing gonadotoxic treatments involves freezing testicular fragments and waking them up in a culture in the context of medically assisted procreation. This implies that spermatogenesis must be fully reproduced ex vivo. The parameters of this type of culture must be validated using non-human models. In this article, the authors make an extensive study of the quality of the organotypic culture of neonatal mouse testes, paying particular attention to the differentiation and endocrine function of Leydig cells. They show that fetal Leydig cells present at the start of culture fail to complete the differentiation process into adult Leydig cells, which has an impact on the nature of the steroids produced and even on the signaling of these hormones.</p>
<p>The authors make an extensive study of the different populations of Leydig cells which are supposed to succeed each other during the first month of life of the mouse to end up with a population of adult and fully functional cells. The authors combine quantitative in situ studies with more global analyzes (RT-QtPCR Western blot, hormonal assays), which range from gene to hormone. This study is well written and illustrated, the description of the methods is honest, the analyses systematic, and are accompanied by multiple relevant control conditions.</p>
<p>Since the aim of the study was to study Leydig cell differentiation in neonatal mouse testis cultures, the study is well conceived, the results answer the initial question and are not over-interpreted.</p>
<p>My main concern is to understand why the authors have undertaken so much work when they mention RNA extractions and western blot, that the necrotic central part had to be carefully removed. There is no information on how this parameter was considered for immunohistochemistry and steroid measurements. The authors describe the initial material as a quarter testis, but they don't mention the resulting size of the fragment. A brief review of the literature shows that if often the culture medium is crucial for the quality of the culture (and in particular the supplementations as discussed by the authors here), the size of the fragments is also a determining factor, especially for long cultures. The main limitation of the study is therefore that the authors cannot exclude that central necrosis can have harmful effects on the survival and/or the growth and/or the differentiation of the testis in culture. In this sense, the general interpretation that the authors make of their work is correct, the culture conditions are not optimized.</p>
<p>Organotypic culture is currently trying to cross the doors of academic research laboratories to become a clinical tool, but it requires many adjustments and many quality controls. This study shows a perfect example of the pitfall often associated with this approach. The road is still long, but every piece of information is useful.</p>

<p>Moutard, Laura, et al. investigated the gene expression and functional aspects of Leydig cells in a cryopreservation/long-term culture system. The authors found that critical genetic markers for Leydig cells were diminished when compared to the in-vivo testis. The testis also showed less androgen production and androgen responsiveness. Although they did not produce normal testosterone concentrations in basal media conditions, the cultured testis still remained highly responsive to gonadotrophin exposure, exhibiting a large increase in androgen production. Even after the hCG-dependent increase in testosterone, genetic markers of Leydig cells remained low, which means there is still a missing factor in the culture media that facilitates proper Leydig cell differentiation. Optimizing this testis culture protocol to help maintain proper Leydig cell differentiation could be useful for future human testis biopsy cultures, which will help preserve fertility and child cancer patients.</p>
<p>Methods: In line 226, there is mention that the central necrotic area was carefully removed before RNA extraction. This is particularly problematic for the inference of these results, especially for the RT-qPCR data. Was the central necrotic area consistent between all samples and variables (16 and 30FT)? How big was the area? This makes the in-vivo testis not a proper control for all comparisons. Leydig cells are not evenly distributed throughout the testis. A lot of Leydig cells can be found toward the center of the gonad, so the results might be driven by the loss of this region of the testis.</p>
<p>What did the morphology of the testis look like after culturing for 16 and 30 days? These images will help confirm that the culturing method is like the Nature paper Sato et al. 2011 and also give a sense of how big the necrotic region was and how it varied with culturing time.</p>
<p>There are multiple comparisons being made. Bonferroni corrections on p-value should be done.</p>
<p>Results: In the discussion, it is mentioned that IGF1 may be a missing factor in the media that could help Leydig cell differentiation. Have the authors tried this experiment? Improving this existing culturing method will be highly valuable.</p>
<p>Add p-values and SEM for qPCR data. This was done for hormones, should be the same way for other results.</p>
<p>Regarding all RT-qPCR data-There is a switch between 3bHSD and Actb/Gapdh as housekeeping genes. There does not seem to be as some have 3bHSD and others do not. Why do Igf1 and Dhh not use 3bHSD for housekeeping? If this is the method to be used, then 3bHSD should be used as housekeeping for the protein data, instead of ACTB. Also, based on Figure 1B and Figure 2A (Hsd3b1) there does not seem to be a strong correlation between Leydig cell # and the gene expression of Hsd3b1. If Hsd3b1 is to be used as a housekeeper and a proxy for Leydig cell number a correlation between these two measurements is necessary. If there is no correlation a housekeeping gene that is stable among all samples should be used. Sorting Leydig cells and then conducting qPCR would be optimal for these experiments.</p>
<p>Figure 2A (CYP17a1): It is surprising that the CYP17a1 gene and protein expression is very different between D30FT and 36.5dpp, however, the immunostaining looks identical between all groups. Why is this? A lower magnification image of the testis might make it easier to see the differences in Cyp17a1 expression. Leydig cells commonly have autofluorescence and need a background quencher (TrueBlack) to visualize the true signal in Leydig cells. This might reveal the true differences in Cyp17a1.</p>
<p>Figure 3D: there are large differences in estradiol concentration in the testis. Could it be that the testis is becoming more female-like? Leydig and Sertoli cells with more granulosa and theca cell features? Were any female markers investigated?</p>
<p>Figure 3D and Figure 5A: It is hard to imagine that intratesticular estradiol is maintained for 16-30 days without sufficient CYP19 activity or substrate (testosterone). 6.5 dpp was the last day with abundant CYP19 expression, so is most of the estrogen synthesized on this first day and it sticks around? Are there differences in estradiol metabolizing enzymes? Is there an alternative mechanism for E production?</p>

<p>As explained below, we will rework and reorganize the manuscript to make it clearer, more meaningful and more precise. We believe that this work may be of interest to a broader readership. Indeed, the development of a model of <italic>in vitro</italic> spermatogenesis could be of interest for labs working on the specific period of puberty initiation, on germ and somatic cell maturation and on steroidogenesis during this period, and could even be useful for testing the toxicity of cancer therapies, drugs, chemicals and environmental agents (e.g. endocrine disruptors) on the developing testis.</p>

<p>Preserving and restoring the fertility of prepubertal patients undergoing gonadotoxic treatments involves freezing testicular fragments and waking them up in a culture in the context of medically assisted procreation. This implies that spermatogenesis must be fully reproduced ex vivo. The parameters of this type of culture must be validated using non-human models. In this article, the authors make an extensive study of the quality of the organotypic culture of neonatal mouse testes, paying particular attention to the differentiation and endocrine function of Leydig cells. They show that fetal Leydig cells present at the start of culture fail to complete the differentiation process into adult Leydig cells, which has an impact on the nature of the steroids produced and even on the signaling of these hormones.</p>
<p>The authors make an extensive study of the different populations of Leydig cells which are supposed to succeed each other during the first month of life of the mouse to end up with a population of adult and fully functional cells. The authors combine quantitative in situ studies with more global analyzes (RT-QtPCR Western blot, hormonal assays), which range from gene to hormone. This study is well written and illustrated, the description of the methods is honest, the analyses systematic, and are accompanied by multiple relevant control conditions.</p>
<p>Since the aim of the study was to study Leydig cell differentiation in neonatal mouse testis cultures, the study is well conceived, the results answer the initial question and are not over-interpreted.</p>
<p>My main concern is to understand why the authors have undertaken so much work when they mention RNA extractions and western blot, that the necrotic central part had to be carefully removed. There is no information on how this parameter was considered for immunohistochemistry and steroid measurements. The authors describe the initial material as a quarter testis, but they don't mention the resulting size of the fragment. A brief review of the literature shows that if often the culture medium is crucial for the quality of the culture (and in particular the supplementations as discussed by the authors here), the size of the fragments is also a determining factor, especially for long cultures. The main limitation of the study is therefore that the authors cannot exclude that central necrosis can have harmful effects on the survival and/or the growth and/or the differentiation of the testis in culture. In this sense, the general interpretation that the authors make of their work is correct, the culture conditions are not optimized.</p>

<p>When using the organotypic culture system at a gas-liquid interphase, the central part of the testicular tissue becomes necrotic. As previously reported (Komeya <italic>et al</italic>., 2016), the central region receives insufficient nutrients and oxygen. <italic>In vitro</italic> spermatogenesis therefore only occurs in the seminiferous tubules present in the peripheral region. As in our previous publications and recent RNA-seq analyses (Dumont <italic>et al</italic>., 2023), the central necrotic area was removed so that transcript and protein levels in the healthy part of the samples (i.e. where <italic>in vitro</italic> spermatogenesis occurs) could be measured and compared with <italic>in vivo</italic> controls. For histochemical and immunohistochemical analyses, only seminiferous tubules located at the periphery of the cultured fragments (outside of the necrotic region) were analyzed. Steroid measurements were performed on the entire fragments.</p>
<p>The initial material was indeed a quarter testis, which represents approximately 0.75 mm3. No growth of the fragments was observed during the organotypic culture period. We agree with the reviewer that the composition of the culture medium is not the only parameter to be considered for the quality of the culture and that the size of the fragments is also a determining factor. We do not exclude that central necrosis can have harmful effects on the survival and/or the growth and/or the differentiation of the testis in culture. Optimization of the culture medium and culture design (so that the tissue center receives sufficient nutrients and oxygen) will be necessary to increase the yield of <italic>in vitro</italic> spermatogenesis.</p>

<p>Organotypic culture is currently trying to cross the doors of academic research laboratories to become a clinical tool, but it requires many adjustments and many quality controls. This study shows a perfect example of the pitfall often associated with this approach. The road is still long, but every piece of information is useful.</p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Moutard, Laura, et al. investigated the gene expression and functional aspects of Leydig cells in a cryopreservation/long-term culture system. The authors found that critical genetic markers for Leydig cells were diminished when compared to the in-vivo testis. The testis also showed less androgen production and androgen responsiveness. Although they did not produce normal testosterone concentrations in basal media conditions, the cultured testis still remained highly responsive to gonadotrophin exposure, exhibiting a large increase in androgen production. Even after the hCG-dependent increase in testosterone, genetic markers of Leydig cells remained low, which means there is still a missing factor in the culture media that facilitates proper Leydig cell differentiation. Optimizing this testis culture protocol to help maintain proper Leydig cell differentiation could be useful for future human testis biopsy cultures, which will help preserve fertility and child cancer patients.</p>
<p>Methods: In line 226, there is mention that the central necrotic area was carefully removed before RNA extraction. This is particularly problematic for the inference of these results, especially for the RT-qPCR data. Was the central necrotic area consistent between all samples and variables (16 and 30FT)? How big was the area? This makes the in-vivo testis not a proper control for all comparisons. Leydig cells are not evenly distributed throughout the testis. A lot of Leydig cells can be found toward the center of the gonad, so the results might be driven by the loss of this region of the testis.</p>

<p>The central necrotic area was consistent between all samples and variables: it represents on average 16-27% of the explants.</p>
<p>Moreover, we would like to point out that the gonads were cut into four fragments before <italic>in vitro</italic> cultures. It is therefore the central part of these explants that was removed and not the central part of the gonads. The central part of the gonads was thus included in our analyses.</p>

<p>What did the morphology of the testis look like after culturing for 16 and 30 days? These images will help confirm that the culturing method is like the Nature paper Sato et al. 2011 and also give a sense of how big the necrotic region was and how it varied with culturing time.</p>

<p>Results: In the discussion, it is mentioned that IGF1 may be a missing factor in the media that could help Leydig cell differentiation. Have the authors tried this experiment? Improving this existing culturing method will be highly valuable.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The decreased <italic>Igf1</italic> mRNA levels found in the present study are in line with the RNA-seq data of Yao <italic>et al</italic>., 2017. As mentioned in the Discussion section, the addition of IGF1 in the culture medium led to a modest increase in the percentages of round and elongated spermatids in cultured mouse testicular fragments (Yao <italic>et al</italic>., 2017). However, the effect of IGF1 supplementation on Leydig cell differentiation was not investigated. The supplementation of organotypic culture medium with IGF1 is currently being tested in our research team.</p>

<p>Add p-values and SEM for qPCR data. This was done for hormones, should be the same way for other results.</p>

<p>p-values and SEM are shown for both qPCR and hormone data.</p>

<p>Regarding all RT-qPCR data-There is a switch between 3bHSD and Actb/Gapdh as housekeeping genes. There does not seem to be as some have 3bHSD and others do not. Why do Igf1 and Dhh not use 3bHSD for housekeeping? If this is the method to be used, then 3bHSD should be used as housekeeping for the protein data, instead of ACTB. Also, based on Figure 1B and Figure 2A (Hsd3b1) there does not seem to be a strong correlation between Leydig cell # and the gene expression of Hsd3b1. If Hsd3b1 is to be used as a housekeeper and a proxy for Leydig cell number a correlation between these two measurements is necessary. If there is no correlation a housekeeping gene that is stable among all samples should be used. Sorting Leydig cells and then conducting qPCR would be optimal for these experiments.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p><italic>Hsd3b1</italic> was used as a housekeeping gene only to normalize the mRNA levels of Leydig cell-specific genes. Therefore, <italic>Igf1</italic> and <italic>Dhh</italic> transcript levels were not normalized with <italic>Hsd3b1</italic> since <italic>Igf1</italic> is expressed by several cell types in the testis (Leydig cells, Sertoli cells, peritubular myoid cells) and <italic>Dhh</italic> is expressed by Sertoli cells.</p>
<p>Regarding western blots, the expression of AR, CYP19 and FAAH could not be normalized with 3bHSD since AR is expressed by Leydig cells, Sertoli cells and peritubular myoid cells, CYP19 is expressed by Leydig cells and germ cells and FAAH is expressed by Sertoli cells. We will review the western blot results for CYP17A1.</p>
<p>As shown in Figure 1B, the number of Leydig cells per cm2 of testicular tissue is not significantly different between the different time points <italic>in vivo</italic> (6 d_pp_, 22 d_pp_ and 36 d_pp_), <italic>in vitro</italic> (D16 FT and D30 FT) and between the <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> conditions (22 d_pp_ versus D16 FT, 36 d_pp_ versus D30 FT). Similarly, our data in Figure 2A show that <italic>Hsd3b1</italic> mRNA levels are not significantly different between the different time points <italic>in vivo</italic> (6 d_pp_, 22 d_pp_ and 36 d_pp_), <italic>in vitro</italic> (D16 FT and D30 FT) and between 22 d_pp_ and D16 FT. However, <italic>Hsd3b1_mRNA levels were significantly lower in D30 FT tissues compared to 36 d_pp</italic>. We will measure the correlation between the number of Leydig cells per cm2 of testicular tissue and <italic>Hsd3b1</italic> mRNA levels, as suggested by the reviewer.</p>

<p>Figure 2A (CYP17a1): It is surprising that the CYP17a1 gene and protein expression is very different between D30FT and 36.5dpp, however, the immunostaining looks identical between all groups. Why is this? A lower magnification image of the testis might make it easier to see the differences in Cyp17a1 expression. Leydig cells commonly have autofluorescence and need a background quencher (TrueBlack) to visualize the true signal in Leydig cells. This might reveal the true differences in Cyp17a1.</p>

<p>Figure 3D: there are large differences in estradiol concentration in the testis. Could it be that the testis is becoming more female-like? Leydig and Sertoli cells with more granulosa and theca cell features? Were any female markers investigated?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We show in the present study that the expression level of the Sertoli cell-specific gene <italic>Dhh</italic> is not reduced in organotypic cultures. We also previously found that the expression level of the Sertoli-cell specific gene <italic>Amh</italic> was not reduced in <italic>in vitro</italic> matured testicular tissues (Rondanino <italic>et al</italic>., 2017). Moreover, our recent unpublished data show that Sox9, a testis-specific transcription factor, is expressed in Sertoli cells in organotypic cultures. These results suggest that Sertoli cells are not becoming granulosa-like cells and that the testis is not becoming more female-like. Markers of granulosa and theca cells were not investigated.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Figure 3D and Figure 5A: It is hard to imagine that intratesticular estradiol is maintained for 16-30 days without sufficient CYP19 activity or substrate (testosterone). 6.5 dpp was the last day with abundant CYP19 expression, so is most of the estrogen synthesized on this first day and it sticks around? Are there differences in estradiol metabolizing enzymes? Is there an alternative mechanism for E production?</p>
