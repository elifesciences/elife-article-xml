<title>Abstract</title><p>The coordination of cell cycle progression and flagellar synthesis is a complex process in motile bacteria. In γ-proteobacteria, the localization of the flagellum to the cell pole is mediated by the SRP-type GTPase FlhF. However, the mechanism of action of FlhF, and its relationship with the cell pole landmark protein HubP remain unclear. In this study, we discovered a novel protein called FipA that is required for normal FlhF activity and function in polar flagellar synthesis. We demonstrated that membrane-localized FipA interacts with FlhF and is required for normal flagellar synthesis in <italic>Vibrio parahaemolyticus</italic>, <italic>Pseudomonas putida</italic>, and <italic>Shewanella putrefaciens</italic>, and it does so independently of the polar localization mediated by HubP. FipA exhibits a dynamic localization pattern and is present at the designated pole before flagellar synthesis begins, suggesting its role in licensing flagellar formation. This discovery provides insight into a new pathway for regulating flagellum synthesis and coordinating cellular organization in bacteria that rely on polar flagellation and FlhF-dependent localization.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Many cellular processes depend on a specific spatiotemporal organization of its components. The DNA replication machinery, cell division proteins and motility structures are some examples of elements that need to be positioned at a particular site during the cell cycle in a coordinated manner to ensure adequate cell division or proper function of the structures. To carry out this task, many cellular components of bacteria have a polar organization, <italic>i. e.</italic> they are asymmetrically positioned inside the cell, which is particularly apparent in monopolarly flagellated bacteria. In the marine bacteria <italic>Vibrio</italic>, which constitutively express a single polar flagellum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">McCarter 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Kim and McCarter 2000</xref>), it is crucial to coordinate the localization and timing of flagellar components, in order to guarantee that newly born cells only produce a flagellum in timing with cell division. This process is coordinated with the chromosome replication and the chemotaxis clusters through a supramolecular hub that is tethered at the old cell pole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Takekawa et al. 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Yamaichi et al. 2012</xref>). This organization depends on ATPases of the ParA/MinD family, which regulate the migration of the hub components to the new cell pole as the cell cycle progresses. In this way, the new cell has a copy of the chromosome and a set of chemotaxis clusters positioned next to what will be the site for the new flagellum. Central to this process is the protein HubP, which recruits to the pole the three ATPases responsible for the localization of these organelles: ParA1 for the chromosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Fogel and Waldor 2006</xref>), ParC for the chemotaxis clusters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Ringgaard et al. 2011</xref>) and FlhG for the flagellum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Correa, Peng, and Klose 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Arroyo-Pérez and Ringgaard 2021</xref>). Homologs of HubP occur in several species, e.g., <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> (where it is called FimV), <italic>Shewanella</italic> or <italic>Legionella</italic>, where they similarly act as organizers (hubs) of the cell pole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Wehbi et al. 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Rossmann et al. 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Coil and Anné 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>The bacterial flagellum is a highly intricate and complex subcellular structure. It is composed of around 25 different proteins, which have to be assembled in different stoichiometries in a spatiotemporally coordinated manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Macnab 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Chevance and Hughes, 2008</xref>). Although there may be significant differences among species, flagella in general are composed of a motor attached to the cytoplasmic membrane, a rod connecting it to the extracellular space, a hook and a filament. The basal body is composed of a cytoplasmic C-ring or switch complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Francis et al. 1994</xref>), which receives the signal from the chemotaxis proteins via binding to phosphorylated CheY. The C-ring is connected to the MS-ring, which is embedded in the cytoplasmic membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Homma et al. 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Ueno, Oosawa, and Aizawa 1992</xref>). Attached to it, on the cytoplasmic side, is the export apparatus, which allows secretion of rod, hook and filament components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Minamino 2014</xref>). Flagella can also be sheathed, if an extension of the outer membrane covers the filament, as is the case in many <italic>Vibrio</italic> species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Chen et al. 2017</xref>).</p>
<p>The positioning of the flagella and control of flagellar numbers per cell are mediated in many bacteria by the interplay between two flagellar regulators, FlhF and FlhG. Studies in a wide variety of proteobacteria indicate that FlhG is a negative regulator that restricts the number of flagella that are synthesized. In organisms such as strains of <italic>Vibrio</italic>, <italic>Shewanella putrefaciens</italic> and <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>, the absence of MinD-like ATPase FlhG results in hyper-flagellated cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Kusumoto et al. 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Arroyo-Pérez and Ringgaard 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Schuhmacher et al. 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Blagotinsek et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Campos-García et al. 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Murray and Kazmierczak 2006</xref>). In contrast, in polarly flagellated species such as <italic>Campylobacter jejuni, Vibrio cholerae, Vibrio parahaemolyticus</italic>, <italic>P. aeruginosa, S. putrefaciens</italic> and <italic>Shewanella oneidensis</italic>, the SRP-type GTPase FlhF is a positive regulator of flagellum synthesis and necessary for proper localization. A deletion of <italic>flhF</italic> results in reduced number and mis-localization of flagella (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Hendrixson and Dirita 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Correa, Peng, and Klose 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Arroyo-Pérez and Ringgaard 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Pandza et al. 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Rossmann et al. 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Gao et al. 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Navarrete et al, 2019</xref>).</p>
<p>The current model predicts that GTP-bound dimeric FlhF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bange et al. 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Kondo et al. 2018</xref>) localizes to the cell pole to where it recruits the initial flagellar building blocks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Green et al., 2009</xref>). A long-standing question is how FlhF recognizes and localizes to the designated cell pole. In <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> and <italic>V. alginolyticus</italic> it was demonstrated that FlhF localized polarly upon ectopic production in the absence of the flagellar master regulator FlrA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Green et al. 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Kondo, Homma, and Kojima 2017</xref>). It was therefore speculated that FlhF assumes its polar localization in the absence of other flagellar proteins or even without any further additional protein factors. The underlying mechanism, however, remains enigmatic, given that neither in its monomeric nor its dimeric form, FlhF possesses any regions that would indicate a membrane association. In a recent study it was shown that in the polarly flagellated gammaproteobacterium <italic>Shewanella putrefaciens</italic> FlhF binds the C-ring protein FliG via a specific region at the very N-terminus of FlhF. The FlhF-FliG complex is then recruited to the designated cell pole by HubP, where FlhF-bound FliG captures the transmembrane protein FliF and promotes formation of the MS-ring. This forms the scaffold from where further flagellar synthesis can occur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Dornes et al, 2024</xref>). However, in the absence of HubP, the majority of cells still forms normal polar flagella, indicating that HubP is not the only polarity factor in this process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Rossmann et al, 2015</xref>).</p>
<p>Here, we provide evidence demonstrating that FlhF does not localize independently. Instead, we show that FipA, a small integral membrane protein with a domain of unknown function, facilitates the recruitment of FlhF to the membrane at the cell pole and, at least in some species, it acts in concert with the polar landmark protein HubP/FimV. Using <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> and two additional polarly flagellated γ-proteobacteria, the monopolarly flagellated <italic>S. putrefaciens</italic> and the lophotrichous <italic>P. putida</italic>, we show that FipA universally mediates recruitment of FlhF to the designated cell pole. The spatiotemporal localization behavior of FipA as well as its relationship to FlhF, support its role as a licensing protein that enables flagellum synthesis.</p>

<title>Identification of an FlhF protein interaction partner: FipA</title>
<p>In order to identify potential factors required for FlhF function and its recruitment to the cell pole, we performed affinity purification of a superfolder green fluorescent protein (sfGFP)-tagged FlhF (FlhF-sfGFP) ectopically expressed in wild-type <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> cells followed by shotgun proteomics using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis (LC-MS/MS). Among the proteins that were significantly enriched in FlhF-sfGFP purifications, eight were structural components of the flagellum (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>; Supplementary Table S1), but also a non-flagellar protein, VP2224, was significantly co-purified with FlhF (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>; Supplementary Table S1). The homologue of VP2224 in <italic>V. cholerae</italic>, there named FlrD, was previously shown to exert the same activating role on flagellar gene regulation as FlhF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Moisi et al. 2009</xref>), suggesting a function related to FlhF. Notably, FlhF was also significantly co-purified in the reciprocal co-IP-MS/MS experiment using VP2224-sfGFP as bait (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>), suggesting a direct or indirect interaction of VP2224 and FlhF. To further investigate the co-purification data, bacterial two-hybrid (BACTH) assays in the heterologous host <italic>E. coli</italic> were carried out and suggested a direct interaction between FlhF and VP2224. FlhF and VP2224 were also found to self-interact (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>). Additionally, these data indicated that FlhF and VP2224 form an interaction complex in both the native and a heterologous host organism. Thus, we identified VP2224 as a novel interaction partner of FlhF and named it FipA for Flh<bold><underline>F I</underline></bold>nteraction <bold><underline>P</underline></bold>artner <bold><underline>A</underline></bold>.</p>

<title>FipA constitutes a new family of FlhF interaction partners</title>
<p>The gene encoding FipA is located immediately downstream of the flagellar operon that encodes FlhA, FlhF, FlhG, FliA and the chemotaxis proteins (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>). In <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic>, FipA consists of 163 amino acids with a molecular mass of 18.4 kDa. <italic>In silico</italic> analysis and membrane topology mapping predicted that FipA consists of a short periplasmic N-terminal part, consisting of amino acids 1-5, followed by a transmembrane region (6-28), a cytoplasmic part harboring a coiled region (amino acids 31-58) and a domain of unknown function, DUF2802, positioned in the C-terminal half of the protein (from amino acids 68-135) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>; Supplementary Fig. S1).</p>
<p>InterPro database analyzes found that FipA homologues (<italic>i. e.</italic> membrane proteins consisting of a single cytoplasmic DUF2802 repeat) are widespread among γ-proteobacteria. Exceptions are the <italic>Enterobacteriaceae</italic>, which do not possess any copies of either <italic>fipA</italic> nor of <italic>flhF</italic> and <italic>flhG</italic>. Actually, FipA is only present in genomes that also encode FlhF and FlhG (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F</xref>), which prompted the question of whether FipA is involved in regulating the flagellation pattern in concert with the FlhF-FlhG system. By including in our analysis the flagellation pattern reported in the literature, we found that the species that encode FipA are all polar flagellates, either monotrichous or lophotrichous (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F</xref>). FipA homologues are absent from bacteria that use the FlhF-FlhG system to produce different flagellation patterns, like the peritrichous <italic>Bacillus</italic>, the amphitrichous ε-Proteobacteria or Spirochetes (Supplementary Table S2). In the α-Proteobacteria, where FlhF homologues are only present in a few species, FipA is absent as well (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F</xref>). Based on these analyzes, we hypothesized that FipA represents a new family of FlhF interaction partners important for the γ-proteobacteria. To test this hypothesis, we decided to analyze FipA-FlhF interaction in addition in the distantly related and lophotrichously flagellated <italic>Pseudomonas putida</italic> and the monotrichous <italic>Shewanella putrefaciens</italic>. BACTH analysis showed that the FipA orthologue from both <italic>P. putida</italic> (<italic>Pp</italic>FipA, PP_4331) and <italic>S. putrefaciens</italic> (<italic>Sp</italic>FipA, SputCN32_2550) interact with FlhF of their respective species and that they self-interact (Supplementary Fig. S2) – a result similar to that of FipA from <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> (<italic>Vp</italic>FipA). This supported our hypothesis and indicated that FipA has a general function as an FlhF interaction partner, thus constituting a new class of FlhF interaction partners.</p>

<sec id="s2c">
<title>FipA is required for proper swimming motility and flagellum formation</title>
<p>To explore the role of FipA with respect to flagellation, we generated mutant strains with individual deletions of the <italic>fipA</italic> and <italic>flhF</italic> genes. Strikingly, absence of FipA in <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> completely abolished swimming motility in soft-agar medium to the same degree as cells lacking FlhF (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). Furthermore, single-cell tracking of planktonic <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> cells confirmed that cells lacking FipA were completely non-motile and behaved identical to cells lacking FlhF (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>). Importantly, ectopic expression of FipA in the <italic>ΔfipA</italic> strain restored the strain’s swimming ability to wild-type levels (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>), further supporting that it is the deletion of <italic>fipA</italic> that results in the phenotype and not polar effects resulting from the <italic>fipA</italic> deletion. The C-terminal FipA-sfGFP fusion used throughout this paper also restored the phenotype (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>), indicating that the fusion protein is fully functional. The swimming phenotypes in the absence of FipA could result from defects in either flagellum assembly or in the flagellar motor performance. To differentiate between these possibilities, we examined <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D, E</xref>). Planktonic cells lacking either FlhF or FipA, showed a complete absence of flagella on the bacterial surface, while a single polar flagellum was observed in ∼50 % of wild-type cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D, E</xref>).</p>

<title>FipA and HubP ensure proper localization of FlhF to the cell pole</title>
<p>As our previous results showed an interaction between FipA and FlhF, we analyzed if the intracellular localization of FlhF was influenced by FipA. In this regard, we used functional translational fusions of FlhF to fluorescent proteins expressed from its native site on the chromosome in <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> (Supplementary Figs. S4 and S5; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Arroyo-Pérez and Ringgaard 2021</xref>).</p>
<p>We observed that FlhF localized either diffusely in the cytoplasm or to the cell pole as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Arroyo-Pérez and Ringgaard 2021</xref>). However, a significant delocalization of FlhF from the cell pole occurred in the absence of FipA (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A-C</xref>; Supplementary Fig. 6). Particularly, FlhF was diffusely localized in ∼37% of cells or localized to the cell pole in a uni- and bi-polar manner in ∼45% and ∼19%, respectively, compared to wild-type cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>). Absence of FipA significantly reduced localization of FlhF to the cell pole with a concomitant increase in diffusely localized FlhF (70%; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A-C</xref>, Supplementary Fig. 6). Furthermore, the foci of FlhF at the cell pole in the absence of FipA were significantly dimmer compared to wild-type FlhF foci (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>), indicating that the amount of FlhF localized to the cell pole is lower in the absence of FipA. Importantly, even though FlhF was still able to localize to the cell pole in a certain number of cells lacking FipA, no flagellum was formed in this background (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D-E</xref>), thus indicating that FipA not only is required for proper polar recruitment of FlhF, but also for the stimulation of flagellum formation.</p>

<p>Given the role of HubP in cell pole organization and its reported interaction with FlhF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Yamaichi et al, 2012</xref>), we also analyzed the localization of FlhF in the absence of HubP. As for FipA mutants, recruitment of FlhF to the cell pole was reduced in the absence of HubP (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A-C</xref>, Supplementary Fig. 6). Strikingly, in the double deletion strain <italic>ΔfipA ΔhubP</italic>, FlhF did not localize as foci at the cell pole at all but was instead localized diffusely in the cytoplasm in 100% of cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A-C</xref>, Supplementary Fig. 6). Immunoblot analysis showed that the difference in localization of FlhF-sfGFP was not due to differences in expression levels or protein stability (Supplementary Fig. S5).</p>
<p>Altogether, these data suggest that both FipA and HubP work together to promote normal polar localization of FlhF.</p>

<title>The transmembrane and conserved cytoplasmic domains of FipA is required for its function in regulating flagellum formation and proper FlhF localization</title>
<p>In order to identify the regions of FipA mediating its role in flagellum regulation, we next analyzed the N-terminal transmembrane domain for FipA membrane anchoring and its function in mediating proper flagellum production. When expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic>, a C-terminally GFP-tagged version of FipA (<italic>Vp</italic>FipA-sfGFP) showed a clear membrane localization, while a FipA variant deleted for the predicted transmembrane (TM) domain between residues 7-27 (FipAΔTM), was diffusely localized in the cytoplasm (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>). These observations show that FipA is indeed a membrane protein anchored by the predicted transmembrane domain. To then study the function of FipA membrane localization, the native <italic>fipA</italic> locus was replaced by a gene encoding a FipA variant lacking the N-terminal TM domain, and the resulting strain (<italic>fipA ΔTM</italic>) was analyzed for flagellum production.

<p>After validating an essential role for membrane anchoring of FipA, we analyzed in more detail the cytoplasmic DUF2802 domain. By aligning various FipA homologs, we identified a motif of conserved amino acids, and three of them (G110, E126 and L129 of <italic>Vp</italic>FipA) were 100% conserved among FipA homologues (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>). Therefore, we chose these amino acids for mutagenesis. Alanine substitutions of residues G110 and L129 abolished the interaction between <italic>Vp</italic>FipA and <italic>Vp</italic>FlhF in BACTH analysis, while the E126A substitution did not affect the interaction (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>). All these variants were, however, still able to self-interact with wild-type <italic>Vp</italic>FipA (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>). Altogether, these results suggest that conserved residues in the DUF2802 domain support the interaction between FipA and FlhF, and that the self-interaction is mediated by a different region.</p>

<p>We proceeded to evaluate the role of these residues <italic>in vivo</italic>.

Thus, it seems that the DUF2802 domain of FipA is responsible for the effect of FipA on motility, and that its effects occur primarily through the interaction with FlhF.

<title>Cell cycle-dependent polar localization of FipA</title>
<p>Given FipA’s function in regulating correct recruitment of FlhF to the cell pole, we next analyzed the intracellular localization of FipA. To this end, a hybrid gene bearing a fusion of <italic>fipA</italic> to <italic>sfgfp</italic> was used to replace native <italic>fipA</italic>, resulting in stable and functional production of FipA C-terminally tagged with sfGFP (Supplementary Fig. 11). In wild-type strains, FipA localization remained diffuse in half of the population (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>, Supplementary Fig. 12). In the other half of the population, FipA formed distinct foci at the cell pole, either uni- or bi-polarly (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figs. 6A</xref>, Supplementary Fig. 12). No delocalized foci were ever observed. The FipA localization behavior was explored further by following the protein through the cell cycle. We observed that FipA foci disappear frequently (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C</xref>; 14’). A new focus appears at the opposite pole, sometimes before cell division (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C</xref>; 56’), sometimes after (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C</xref><bold>; 42’</bold>). On rare cases, the first focus persists until after the second focus appears, resulting in bipolar foci (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C</xref>; 70’). These results are consistent with a protein that is recruited to the cell pole right before the start of the flagellum assembly after cell division, albeit the timing may vary between different species.</p>

<title>Functional conservation of FipA in <italic>S. putrefaciens</italic> and <italic>P. putida</italic></title>
<p>Our FipA homology analyses (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F</xref>) indicated that the protein is widely conserved in species also possessing FlhF and FlhG. Accordingly, as in <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic>, FipA interacted with FlhF in the polarly flagellated gammaproteobacteria <italic>S. putrefaciens</italic>, which is monopolarly flagellated and <italic>P. putida</italic>, which is lophotrichously flagellated (Supplementary Fig. 2). We therefore asked to what extent the role of FipA is conserved for flagellation in these two species. To avoid interference with the secondary non-polar flagellar system of <italic>S. putrefaciens</italic>, we used a strain that is unable to form the secondary flagella (<italic>ΔflaAB<sub>2</sub></italic>). Determination of the flagellation state was carried out by fluorescence labeling of the flagellar filament(s) in both species.</p>
<sec id="s2h1">
<title>Spreading</title>
<p>As observed for <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic>, loss of FlhF and FipA negatively affected flagella-mediated spreading in soft agar and flagellation of <italic>P. putida</italic> and <italic>S. putrefaciens</italic>. However, for both species, the phenotype was not as severe as in <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic>: We observed about 40% and 50% in soft-agar spreading of <italic>ΔflhF</italic> mutants and about 25% and 90% spreading of <italic>ΔfipA</italic> mutants in <italic>P. putida</italic> and <italic>S. putrefaciens</italic>, respectively (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A, 2C</xref>; Supplementary Fig. 3).

<sec id="s2i">
<title>Localization of FlhF</title>
<p>We then determined the localization of FlhF in mutants of FipA and HubP or FimV (the HubP homolog in <italic>P. putida</italic>) by using translational fusions of FlhF to fluorescent proteins expressed from the native site on the chromosome in <italic>P. putida</italic> and <italic>S. putrefaciens</italic> (Supplementary Figs. 4 and 5; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Rossmann et al. 2015</xref>).

In contrast, FlhF localization was not affected in a <italic>ΔhubP</italic> background in <italic>S. putrefaciens</italic> (Supplementary Fig. S8; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Rossmann et al, 2015</xref>). However, in a <italic>S. putrefaciens</italic> mutant lacking <italic>fipA</italic>, monopolar localization of FlhF-mVenus decreased significantly (Supplementary Fig. S8). When both <italic>hubP</italic> and <italic>fipA</italic> were deleted in this species, only weak polar localization remained in a minority of cells. Frequently, polar fluorescence was completely lost and FlhF-mVenus was distributed in the cytoplasm. The differences in localization were not due to differences in abundance of FlhF (Supplementary Fig. 5)</p>
<p>The results showed that the function of FipA for flagellation and FlhF localization is generally conserved within the three different species. However, the polar landmark HubP appears to be involved in localizing FlhF, in particular in <italic>S. putrefaciens</italic>, where both HubP and FipA need to be deleted to delocalize FlhF from the cell pole.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2j">
<title>FipA localization pattern</title>
<p>As the next step, we determined the conservation of FipA domains’ function and localization. We found that, as observed in <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic>, loss of the FipA transmembrane region (<italic>fipA ΔTM</italic>) phenocopied a <italic>ΔfipA</italic> mutant in <italic>P. putida</italic> and <italic>S. putrefaciens</italic> (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>, Supplementary Figs. S3A). Furthermore, substitution of the conserved residues within the FipA DUF domain (G104A and L123A in <italic>P. putida</italic> FipA; G106A and L118A in <italic>S. putrefaciens</italic> FipA) decreased or abolished the interaction with FlhF but not FipA self-interaction (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C, G</xref>; Supplementary Fig. S10).</p>
<p>In <italic>P. putida</italic>, similar to <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic>, FipA formed distinct foci at the cell pole, either uni- or bi-polarly (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figs. 6A, B</xref>; Supplementary Fig. 12). A remarkable difference between <italic>P. putida</italic> and <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> is that in <italic>P. putida,</italic> FipA occurred as foci in virtually all cells (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref>), whereas in <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic>, FipA remained diffuse in half of the population (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>). The ratio of bi-polar to uni-polar foci was also greater in <italic>P. putida</italic> (∼1:2) than in <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> (∼1:5). Furthermore, in <italic>P. putida</italic>, the FipA foci were more stable, and foci at both poles often persisted until cell division. In fact, appearance of the second focus at the new pole frequently occurred right after cell division (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6D</xref>; 50’), explaining the greater bi-polar to uni-polar ratio of FipA foci in this organism.</p>
<p>Finally, in <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic>, the localization but not the stability of FipA is dependent on the interaction with FlhF (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>, Supplementary Fig. 11). This was similarly observed for <italic>P. putida</italic>, as the FipA L123A variant, which is unable to interact with FlhF (Fig. S2A), was also mostly distributed in the cytoplasm, whereas the variant FipA G104A did exhibit some polar localization, although reduced (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7E, F</xref>; Supplementary Fig. 14). This is the variant that did show some interaction with <italic>Pp</italic>FlhF (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>). These results suggest that, in <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> and <italic>P. putida</italic>, a direct interaction with FlhF, mediated by the residues in the DUF2802, is responsible for recruiting FipA to the pole.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, in <italic>S. putrefaciens</italic> mutants deleted in <italic>flhF</italic>, FipA displayed only a slight difference in polar localization (Supplementary Fig. 15). However, a <italic>Sp</italic>FipA G106A substitution reduced the protein’s localization (to ∼50% cells with foci). It is likely that in <italic>S. putrefaciens</italic>, HubP is (co-)mediating the localization of FipA, as in the absence of HubP, FipA-sfGFP localization at the cell pole drastically decreases (Supplementary Fig. 15). As observed for <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> and <italic>P. putida</italic>, the stability of FipA was not dependent on the presence of FlhF or FipA in <italic>S. putrefaciens</italic> (Supplementary Fig. S5).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In bacteria, numerous processes are localized to specific cellular compartments. This is particularly evident in polarly flagellated bacteria, where the intricate flagellar multicomplex needs to be synthesized in a spatiotemporally regulated fashion. Flagellar synthesis is initiated by the assembly of the first flagellar building blocks within the cytoplasmic membrane, which in polar flagellates is targeted to the designated cell pole. In a wide range of bacterial species, the SRP-type GTPase FlhF and its antagonistic counterpart, the MinD-like ATPase FlhG, regulate flagellar positioning and number (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Kazmierczak and Hendrixson 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Schuhmacher, Thormann, and Bange 2015</xref>). In particular, FlhF has been shown to function as a positive regulator and a major localization factor for the initial flagellar building blocks of polar flagella. Upon production, GTP-bound dimeric FlhF localizes to the cell pole, but the mechanism by which the protein assumes its designated position at the cell pole remained elusive. One candidate protein, the polar landmark HubP (FimV in <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> sp.) had been identified earlier and was shown to interact with FlhF in <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Yamaichi et al, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Dornes et al, 2024</xref>). Accordingly, polar localization of FlhF is decreased in mutants lacking <italic>hubP</italic> (this study; Rossmann, Brenzinger et al, 2015), however, in a number of cells FlhF localized normally and the cells showed normal flagellation. This was indicative that HubP does play a role in functionally recruiting FlhF, but that another factor was still missing. In this study we identified the protein FipA as a second polarity factor for FlhF.</p>
<p>FipA consists of an N-terminal transmembrane domain and a cytoplasmic region with a conserved domain of unknown function (DUF2802). The corresponding gene is located immediately downstream of the motility operon that includes <italic>flhF</italic> and <italic>flhG</italic>. Notably, FipA is highly conserved among bacteria that use the FlhF/FlhG system to position the flagella, strongly suggesting that FipA has evolved together with FlhF and FlhG to regulate the flagellation pattern. In this study, we therefore investigated three distantly related γ-proteobacteria including one lophotrichous species, <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic>, <italic>P. putida</italic> and <italic>S. putrefaciens</italic>, in more detail. We found that FipA is conserved as a regulatory factor of FlhF and that its functions rely on similar features in all three species.</p>
<p>FipA is essential for normal flagellum synthesis, however, the severity of a <italic>fipA</italic> deletion differed among the three species studied. In <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic>, a <italic>fipA</italic> deletion phenocopies the loss of <italic>flhF</italic>, and cells no longer synthesize flagella. Notably, in the absence of FipA in <italic>V. parahaemolyticus,</italic> FlhF is still localized at the pole in about a third of the cells. Despite this, these cells were still unable to form flagella, strongly suggesting that occurrence of FlhF at the pole alone is not sufficient to trigger flagellum synthesis in the absence of FipA.</p>
<p>This strict requirement for FlhF has been reported in the closely related <italic>V. alginolyticus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Kusumoto et al, 2009</xref>). On the other hand, in <italic>V. cholerae,</italic> the requirement for FlhF on flagellation is less strict (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Green et al, 2009</xref>), and in <italic>P. putida</italic> and <italic>S. putrefaciens</italic> even less so: mutants deleted in <italic>flhF</italic> or <italic>fipA</italic> of both species can generally still produce flagella and swim (this work; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Rossmann et al, 2015</xref>). In <italic>P. putida,</italic> a Δ<italic>fipA</italic> mutant has a phenotype reminiscent of a Δ<italic>flhF</italic> mutant as both drastically decrease the number of flagella, which may also be delocalized in <italic>flhF</italic> mutants (Pandza et al, 2003). In <italic>S. putrefaciens</italic>, deletion of <italic>fipA</italic> decreases the number of flagella to a similar extent as a <italic>flhF</italic> mutation, however, while in the latter case the flagella are frequently delocalized, the flagella remain at a polar postion, when <italic>fipA</italic> is missing. Taken together, these results strongly suggest that FipA does not act as a general polarity factor for the full flagellar machinery, but rather it stimulates the activity of FlhF to initiate polar flagellation.</p>
<sec id="s3a">
<title>FipA and HubP affect polarity of FlhF through different mechanisms</title>
<p>In all three species, FipA directly interacts with FlhF as demonstrated by reciprocal co-immuno precipitations and by bacterial two-hybrid assays. These experiments suggest that FipA is able to dimerize (or oligomerize) and that the FlhF-FipA interaction is dependent on conserved residues in the DUF2802 domain. Furthermore, these residues are not required for the ability of FipA to interact with itself, suggesting that the two processes occur independently and at different protein interfaces. Microscopic and physiological assays showed that direct interaction between FlhF and FipA is required for FlhF targeting and function. In addition, a FipA mutant lacking its N-terminal transmembrane domain was non-functional, indicating that interaction of FlhF and FipA has to take place at the membrane.</p>
<p>In the absence of FipA, polar localization of FlhF was significantly decreased in all three species and almost completely diminished when <italic>hubP</italic> or <italic>fimV</italic> was deleted together with <italic>fipA</italic>. Removing HubP/FimV alone had a similar effect as removing FipA on the localization of FlhF, although to a lesser extent, as more cells still had polar FlhF in the Δ<italic>hubP/fimV</italic> mutant than in the Δ<italic>fipA</italic> mutant. Furthermore, the unipolar to bipolar ratio of FlhF foci increased in the Δ<italic>hubP</italic> mutant compared to the wild-type or the Δ<italic>fipA</italic> background. While the deletion of <italic>fipA</italic> increases the number of cells with diffuse localization, it does not affect the time frame in the cell cycle at which FlhF shifts from unipolar to bipolar in <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic>. In contrast, deleting <italic>hubP</italic> delays the time frame in which FlhF assumes a bipolar position. This indicates that HubP and FipA represent two different pathways that stimulate polar localization of FlhF, and that both are required to bring sufficient (active) FlhF molecules to trigger MS-ring formation and start flagellum assembly.</p>

<sec id="s3b">
<title>Localization of FipA</title>
<p>A notable feature of FipA is its dynamic localization pattern within the cell over the cell cycle in all three species studied, the nature of which is unclear so far. Foci of FipA may appear mono- or bipolarly and frequently, but not necessarily, disappear once the flagellar apparatus, or the flagellar bundle in the case of <italic>P. putida</italic>, is established. It remains to be shown whether the FipA protein is actively moving from one pole to another or if newly formed FipA is recruited to the opposite pole while being degraded at the old position. Notably, in <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> and <italic>P. putida</italic> FipA does not localize polarly in the absence of interaction with FlhF, suggesting that both proteins are recruited as a complex.</p>
<p>In contrast, in <italic>S. putrefaciens,</italic> FipA still localizes to the cell pole also in the absence of FlhF as long as the polar landmark HubP is present. This is indicating a more important role for HubP in this species. Accordingly, it has been shown recently that in <italic>S. putrefaciens</italic> HubP directly interacts with HubP via its NG domain to recruit the initial flagellar building blocks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Dornes et al, 2024</xref>. However, also in <italic>S. putrefaciens</italic> active FlhF localizes to the cell pole and flagella are formed in the absence of HubP. The nature of the polar marker that recruits or guides FipA or a FipA/FlhF to the designated pole is still elusive. The discovery of FipA provides a new point where spatiotemporal organization is coordinated. However, it remains to be explored if the complex is anchored through yet another protein, such as the TonB<sub>m</sub>-PocA-PocB complex in <italic>P. putida</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Ainsaar et al, 2019</xref>) or through an intrinsic feature of the cell envelope or cytoplasm during cell division.</p>

<title>How does FipA upgrade the current model of polar flagellar synthesis?</title>
<p>Based on the findings in different species, our current model of FlhF/FlhG-mediated polar flagellar synthesis predicts, that upon production, GTP-bound dimeric FlhF is localizing or being recruited to the cell pole to where it recruits the first flagellar components to initiate the assembly. The monomeric form of the ATPase FlhG, the FlhF antagonist, is binding to the flagellar C-ring building block FliM and is transferred to the nascent flagellar structure, where it is released and dimerizes upon ATP binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Schuhmacher et al, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Blagotinsek et al, 2020</xref>). The ATP-bound FlhG dimer can associate with the membrane and interact with the GTP-bound FlhF dimer, thereby stimulating its GTPase activity. This leads to monomerization of FlhF and loss of polar localization (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Kojima, Terashima, and Homma 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Schuhmacher et al., 2015</xref>). Dimeric FlhG does also interact with the master regulator of flagella synthesis, FlrA (or FleQ in <italic>Pseudomonas</italic>) and prevents the synthesis of further early flagellar building blocks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Dasgupta &amp; Ramphal, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Blagotinsek et al, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Chanchal et al, 2021</xref>). By this, FlhG links flagella synthesis with transcription regulation and effectively restricts to number of polar flagella that are formed. Based on this model, FipA may recruit FlhF to the membrane and stimulate or stabilize GTP binding and dimerization of FlhF to promote polar localization and initiation of flagella synthesis. Thus, the role of FipA is to shift the equilibrium to the active state of FlhF in order to start assembly of the MS ring. Accordingly, current studies address the structural basis of the FipA-FlhF interaction, the potential effect of FipA on GTP-binding and dimerization of FlhF, and the role of the polar marker HubP in this process. In addition, <italic>fipA</italic> expression is independent of the rest of the flagellar genes in other species of <italic>Vibrio</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Moisi et al. 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Petersen et al. 2021</xref>) and <italic>S. putrefaciens</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Schwan et al, 2022</xref>). Thus, <italic>fipA</italic> transcription could provide another regulatory point to lead to the synthesis of a flagellum. Thus, the discovery of FipA opens several novel open questions in the field of flagellum regulation.</p>

<title>Mapping interaction partners using co-immunoaffinity purification and mass spectrometry (co-IP-MS)</title>
<p>For sample preparation of the IP-MS experiments we were using a modified version of the protocol presented by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Turriziani et al, 2014</xref>. Cells were centrifuged and cell pellets were washed with cold PBS. Cell pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl, 0.5 % NP50, 5 mM EDTA, compete mini protease inhibitors (Complete Mini (Roche)). Cell lysis was performed by repetitive sonication. After removing cell debris by centrifugation 10ul GFP-trap Sepharose (Chromotek) slurry was added to the lysate and incubation was carried out for 1.5 hours on a rotating shaker at 4 °C. Then the beads were pelleted, the supernatant removed and the beads washed 4x with 100 mM NH<sub>4</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> to remove remaining protease inhibitors and detergents. 200 µl elution buffer (1 M urea, 100 mM NH<sub>4</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>, 1 µg Trypsin (Promega)) was added to the beads and incubated at 1000 rpm on a thermomixer at 27°C for 45min. Beads were centrifuged and supernatant was collected. In order to increase peptide recovery 2 washing steps with 100µl elution buffer 2 (1 M urea, 100 mM NH<sub>4</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>, 5 mM Tris(2-caboxyethyl)phosphine)) was performed and the individual bead supernatants were collected into one tube. Tryptic digestion was carried out overnight at 30 °C. After digest alkylation was performed with 10 mM iodoacetamide at 25 °C (in the dark). Then the samples were acidified (1 % trifluoroacetic acid (TFA)) and C18 Microspin column (Harvard Apparatus) was carried out according to the manufactureŕs instruction. The samples were dried and recovered in 0.1 % TFA and applied to liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) analysis.</p>
<p>LC-MS analysis of digested lysates was performed on a Thermo QExactive Plus mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific), which was connected to an electrospray ionsource (Thermo Scientific). Peptide separation was carried out using an Ultimate 3000 RSLCnano with Proflow upgrade (Thermo Scientific) equipped with a RP-HPLC column (75 μm x 42 cm) packed in-house with C18 resin (2.4 μm; Dr. Maisch) on an in-house designed column heater. The following separating gradient was used: 98 % solvent A (0.15 % formic acid) and 2 % solvent B (99.85 % acetonitrile, 0.15 % formic acid) to 35 % solvent B over 90 at a flow rate of 300 nl/min. The data acquisition mode was set to obtain one high resolution MS scan at a resolution of 70,000 full width at half maximum (at m/z 200) followed by MS/MS scans of the 10 most intense ions. To increase the efficiency of MS/MS attempts, the charged state screening modus was enabled to exclude unassigned and singly charged ions. The dynamic exclusion duration was set to 30 sec. The ion accumulation time was set to 50 ms (MS) and 50 ms at 17,500 resolution (MS/MS). The automatic gain control (AGC) was set to 3×10<sup>6</sup> for MS survey scan and 1×10<sup>5</sup> for MS/MS scans.</p>
<p>MS raw data was then analyzed with MaxQuant (Version 1.6.3.4) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.1511">https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.1511</ext-link>) using a <italic>V.parahaemolyticus</italic> RIMD 2210633 uniprot database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.uniprot.org">www.uniprot.org</ext-link>). MaxQuant was executed in standard settings with activated “match between runs” option. The search criteria were set as follows: full tryptic specificity was required (cleavage after lysine or arginine residues); two missed cleavages were allowed; carbamidomethylation (C) was set as fixed modification; oxidation (M) and deamidation (N,Q) as variable modification. For further data analysis the MaxQuant LFQ values were loaded into Perseus (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nmeth.3901">https://www.nature.com/articles/nmeth.3901</ext-link>) and a Student’s T-test was performed on LFQ values with false discovery rate 0.01 and S0: 0.1 as significance cut-off.</p>
<p>The mass spectrometry proteomics data have been deposited to the ProteomeXchange Consortium via the PRIDE (PubMed ID: 34723319) partner repository with the dataset identifier PXD045379 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride">http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride</ext-link>).</p>

<title>Membrane topology mapping of FipA</title>
<p>We experimentally determined the membrane orientation of FipA in the membrane using the dual pho-lac reporter system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Karimova et al, 2009</xref>), which consists of a translational fusion of the <italic>E. coli</italic> alkaline phosphatase fragment PhoA22-472 and the α-peptide of <italic>E. coli</italic> β-galactosidase, LacZ4-60. A periplasmic localization of the reporter leads to high alkaline phosphatase activity and low β-galactosidase activity, whereas a cytosolic location of the reporter results in high β-galactosidase activity and low alkaline phosphatase activity. Pho-Lac-FipA and FipA-Pho-Lac fusion proteins were ectopically expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic> DH5α grown on a dual-indicator LB medium containing a blue indicator for phosphatase activity (X-Phos) and red indicator for β-galactosidase activity (Red-Gal) (see Supplementary Figure S1).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4m">
<title>Bioinformatic analysis</title>
<p>Homologues of FipA were searched using BLAST against the KEGG database, with the sequence of the <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> protein. All homologues containing a DUF2802 were included. The search was later expanded to species known to encode a FlhF homologue (defined as the highest scoring result from a BLAST search using FlhF of <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> as a query, that was also encoded upstream of an FlhG homologue). The flagellation phenotype was later corroborated in the description registered at the List of Prokaryotic names with Standing in Nomenclature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Parte et al. 2020</xref>).</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Bacteria exhibit species-specific numbers and localization patterns of flagella. How specificity in number and pattern is achieved is poorly understood but often depends on a soluble GTPase called FlhF. Here the authors take an unbiased protein-pulldown approach to identify a protein FipA in V. parahaemolyticus that interacts with FlhF. They show that FipA co-occurs with FlhF in the genomes of bacteria with polarly-localized flagella and study the role of FipA in three different bacteria: V. parahaemolyticus, S. purtefaciens, and P. putida. In each case, they show that FipA contributes to FlhF polar localization, flagellar assembly, flagellar patterning, and motility to different species-specific extents.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors perform a comprehensive analysis of FipA, including phenotyping of mutants, protein localization, localization dependence, and domains of FipA necessary for each. Moreover, they perform a time-series analysis indicating that FipA localizes to the cell pole likely prior to, or at least coincident with, flagellar assembly. They also show that the role of FipA appears to differ between organisms in detail but the overarching idea that it is a flagellar assembly/localization factor remains convincing.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>For me the comparative analysis in the different organism was on balance, a weakness. By mixing the data for each of the organisms together, I found it difficult to read, and take away key points from the results. In its current form, the individual details seem to crowd out the model.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors identify a novel protein, FipA, which facilitates recruitment of FlhF to the membrane at the cell pole together with the known recruitment factor HupB. This finding is key to understanding the mechanism of polar localization. By comparing the role of FipA in polar flagellum assembly in three different species from Vibrio, Shewanella and Pseudomonas, they discover that, while FipA is required in all three systems, evolution has brought different nuances that open avenues for further discoveries.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The discovery of a novel factor for polar flagellum development. A significant contribution to our understanding of flagellar evolution. The solid nature and flow of the experimental work.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>All my concerns have been addressed. I find no weaknesses. A nice, solid piece of work.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors investigate how polar flagellation is achieved in gamma-proteobacteria. By probing for proteins that interact with the known flagellar placement factor FlhF, they uncover a new regulator (FipA) for flagellar assembly and polar positioning in three flagellated gamma-proteobacteria. They convincingly demonstrate that FipA interacts genetically and biochemically with previously known spatial regulators HubP and FlhF. FipA is a membrane protein with a cytoplasmic DUF2802 and it co-localizes to the flagellated pole with HubP and FlhF. The DUF2802 mediates the interaction between FipA and FlhF and this interaction is required for FipA function. FipA localization depends on HubP and FlhF.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The work is throughly executed, relying on bacterial genetics, cell biology and protein interaction studies. The analysis is deep, beginning with the discovery af a new and conserved factor, to the molecular dissection of the protein and probing localisation and interaction determinants. Finally, they show that these determinants are important for function and they perform these studies in parallel in three model systems.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Because some of the phenotypes and localisation dependencies differ somewhat between model systems, the comparison is challenging to the reader because it is sometimes not obvious what these differences mean and why they arise.</p>

<p>This important research uses an elegant combination of protein-protein biochemistry, genetics, and microscopy to demonstrate that the novel bacterial protein FipA is required for polar flagella synthesis and binds to FlhF in multiple bacterial species. This manuscript is convincing, providing evidence for the early stages of flagellar synthesis at a cell pole; however, the protein biochemistry is incomplete and would benefit from additional rigorous experiments. This paper could be of significant interest to microbiologists studying bacterial motility, appendages, and cellular biology.</p>

<p><bold>Joint Public Review:</bold></p>
<p>Bacteria exhibit species-specific numbers and localization patterns of flagella. How specificity in number and pattern is achieved in Gamma-proteobacteria needs to be better understood but often depends on a soluble GTPase called FlhF. Here, the authors take an unbiased protein-pulldown approach with FlhF, resulting in identifying the protein FipA in <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic>. They convincingly demonstrate that FipA interacts genetically and biochemically with previously known spatial regulators HubP and FlhF. FipA is a membrane protein with a cytoplasmic DUF2802; it co-localizes to the flagellated pole with HubP and FlhF. The DUF2802 mediates the interaction between FipA and FlhF, and this interaction is required for FipA function. Altogether, the authors show that FipA likely facilitates the recruitment of FlhF to the membrane at the cell pole together with the known recruitment factor HupB. This finding is crucial in understanding the mechanism of polar localization. The authors show that FipA co-occurs with FlhF in the genomes of bacteria with polarly-localized flagella and study the role of FipA in three of these organisms: V. parahaemolyticus, S. purtefaciens, and P. putida. In each case, they show that FipA contributes to FlhF polar localization, flagellar assembly, flagellar patterning, and motility, though the details differ among the species. By comparing the role of FipA in polar flagellum assembly in three different species, they discover that, while FipA is required in all three systems, evolution has brought different nuances that open avenues for further discoveries.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The discovery of a novel factor for polar flagellum development. The solid nature and flow of the experimental work.</p>
<p>The authors perform a comprehensive analysis of FipA, including phenotyping of mutants, protein localization, localization dependence, and domains of FipA necessary for each. Moreover, they perform a time-series analysis indicating that FipA localizes to the cell pole likely before, or at least coincident with, flagellar assembly. They also show that the role of FipA appears to differ between organisms in detail, but the overarching idea that it is a flagellar assembly/localization factor remains convincing.</p>
<p>The work is well-executed, relying on bacterial genetics, cell biology, and protein interaction studies. The analysis is deep, beginning with discovering a new and conserved factor, then the molecular dissection of the protein, and finally, probing localization and interaction determinants. Finally, the authors show that these determinants are important for function; they perform these studies in parallel in three model systems.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The comparative analysis in the different organisms was on balance, a weakness. Mixing the data for the organisms together made the text difficult to read and took away key points from the results. The individual details crowded out the model in its current form. Indeed, because some of the phenotypes and localization dependencies differ between model systems, the comparison is challenging to the reader. The authors could more clearly state what these differences mean, why they arise, and (in the discussion) how they might relate to the organism's lifestyle.</p>
<p>More experiments would be needed to fully analyze the effects of interacting proteins on individual protein stability; this absence slightly detracted from the conclusions.</p>

<p>I think there is value to the comparative analysis but how to present it in such a way that the key similarities and differences stand out is the challenge. Perhaps a table that compares the three datasets is sufficient. Or tell the story of <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> first to establish the model, followed by comparative analysis of the other two organisms highlighting differences and relegating similarities to supplemental?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree that the our previous presentation of our comparative analysis made it very hard to follow the major findings and the general role(s) of FipA, and we are very grateful for the suggestions on how to improve this. We have decided to change the presentation as the reviewer recommended. We used <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> as a ‚lead model‘ to describe the role of FipA, and we then compared the major findings to the other two species. We hope that the story is now easier to follow.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>This is not something that needs to be addressed in the text but I wanted to bring the protein SwrB to the authors' attention which may further expand FipA relevance. Bacillus subtilis uses FlhFG to somehow pattern flagella in a peritrichous arrangement and there are a number of striking similarities, in my opinion, between FipA and SwrB. The two proteins have very similar domain architecture/topology, both proteins promote flagellar assembly, and the genetic neighborhood/operon organization is uncannily similar. There are other more minor similarities dependent on the organism in this paper.</p>

<p>We thank this reviewer for pointing out these intriguing similarities. For this study we have decided to exclusively concentrate on polarly flagellated bacteria. FlhF und FlhG are also present in <italic>B. subtilis</italic> where they play a role in organizing flagellation, but we feel that this would be out of scope for this manuscript.</p>

<p>We would like to thank this reviewer for the very positive evaluation and for pointing out several issues to strengthen the story.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Figure 3A data are problematic since everything is too small to visualize. Since these are functional GFP fusions (or mCherry for 2E data), why are they not presented in color?</p>
<p>Again - why are color figures not used to help the reader in Fig 4A and 5F &amp; 5G to confirm what is asserted?</p>
<p>Again, it is difficult to see the images presented. It is asserted that FipA is recruited to the cell pole after cell division and before flagellum assembly, but one has to take their word for it.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We fully agree that in some case the localization pattern is hard to see on the micrographs presented. We have, therefore, provided enlarged micrographs in the supplemental part which allow to better see the fluorescent foci within the cells. With respect to presentations in color – we found that this did not improve the visibility of localizations and therefore have decided to use the grayscale images.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Here, what is missing are turnover assays. Do FipA, FlhF, and HubP all co-localize as complex or is the absence of one leading to the protein turnover of other partners? I think this needs to be sorted out before final conclusions can be made.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks for pointing out this important point. We have now provided western analysis which demonstrate that FipA and FlhF are produced and stable in the absence of the other partners (see Supplemental Figure 5). Stability of HubP as a general polar marker not only required for flagellation was not determined.</p>

<p>Minor comments:</p>
<p>Line 58: change &quot;around&quot; to &quot;in timing with&quot;</p>
<p>Line 79: what &quot;signal&quot; is transferred from the C-ring to the MS-ring. Are they not fully connected such that rotation is the entire structure - C-ring-MS-ring-Rod-Hook-Filament. Is it not the change in the relationship to the stator complex where the signal is transferred?</p>
<p>Line 85: change &quot;counting&quot; to &quot;control of flagellar numbers per cell&quot;</p>
<p>Line 110: change &quot;is (co-)responsible for recruiting&quot; to &quot;facilitates recruitment of&quot;</p>

<p>Thanks for pointing this out. We have adjusted the wording according to the reviewer’s suggestions.</p>

<p>Given that motility phenotypes vary on individual plates (volumes and dryness vary), why in Figure 2C are the motility assays for fipA and flhF mutants of <italic>P. putida</italic> done on different plates?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>For better visualisation, we have rearranged the spreading halos for the figure. All strain spreading comparisons on soft agar were always conducted on the same plate due to the reasons this reviewer mentioned.</p>

<p>One possibility is to describe first all the results relating to FipA in Vibrio and then add the result sections at the end to illustrate the differences between Vibrio and Shewanella, and then Vibrio and Pseudomonas. This may make it easier to follow for the reader.</p>

<p>We agree that the our previous presentation of our comparative analysis made it very hard to follow the major findings and the general role(s) of FipA, and we are very grateful for the suggestions on how to improve this.

<p>I would have liked to see some TEM analysis of flagella in <italic>fipA</italic>/<italic>hubP</italic> double mutants strains and was also wondering if FipA/FlhF/HubP colocalization had been studied in <italic>E. coli</italic> when all proteins are expressed together, at least with two bearing fluorescent tags.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks for these great suggestions. In this study, we have concentrated on the localization of FlhF by FipA and HubP. HubP has multiple functions in the cell and may also affect flagellar synthesis to some extent in a species-specific fashion. Therefore, any findings would have to be discussed very carefully, so we have decided to leave that out for the time being.</p>
<p>With respect to the FipA/HubP/FlhF production in a heterologous host such as <italic>E. coli</italic>, this has been partly done (without FipA) in a second parallel story (see reference to Dornes et al (2024) in this manuscript). Rebuilding larger parts of the system in a heterologous host is currently done in an independent study. Therefore, we have decided not to include this already here.</p>

<p>The microscopy was inconsistent (DIC versus phase) for unclear reasons. Did using different microscopes impact the ability to acquire low-intensity fluorescence signals? Please add a sentence in the Methods section to clarify.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We are sorry for this inconsistency. As the imaging was carried out by different labs (to some part before the projects were joined), the corresponding preferred microscopy settings were used. We have added an explaining sentence to the Methods section.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Also, some subcellular fluorescence localizations were not visible in the selected images (e.g., Figures 3 and 5). The reader had to rely on the authors' statements and analyses. The conclusions could be more robust with fluorescence measurements across the cell body for a subset of cells. The authors could provide this data analysis in the Supplemental; this measurement would more clearly show an accumulation of fluorescence at the cell pole, particularly in low-intensity images.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We fully agree that in some case the localization pattern is hard to see on the micrographs presented. Unfortunately, often the signal is not sufficiently strong to provied proper demographs. We have, therefore, provided enlarged micrographs in the supplemental part, which allow to better see the fluorescent foci within the cells.</p>
