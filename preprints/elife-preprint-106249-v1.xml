<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Tumors with low expression of Interferon-Stimulated Genes (ISG) and Antigen Presentation (AP) genes respond relatively poorly to current immunotherapies. One of the early hallmarks of cancer is DNA hypomethylation in genomic repeat regions, resulting in the expression of normally silenced endogenous “viral” elements. Such epigenetic changes have the potential to augment anti-tumor immune responses as well as reduce tumor cell fitness through the generation of aberrant nucleic acid species (NAS) and consequent activation of NAS-sensing pathways. Therefore, tumor evolution should favor additional selective events that suppress NAS generation, possibly yielding specific therapeutic vulnerabilities. Here, we show that the Lysine Demethylase 5 (KDM5) family of epigenetic regulatory enzymes suppress R-loop formation in genomic repeat regions in cancer cells. We find that KDM5 inhibition in luminal breast cancer cells results in R-loop-mediated DNA damage, reduced cell fitness and an increase in ISG and AP signatures as well as cell surface Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) class I, mediated by RNA:DNA hybrid activation of the CGAS/STING pathway. KDM5 inhibition does not result in DNA damage or activation of the CGAS/STING pathway in normal breast epithelial cells, suggesting that KDM5 inhibitors may enable a wide therapeutic window in this setting, as compared to STING agonists or Type I Interferons. These findings provide new insights into the interplay between epigenetic regulation of genomic repeats, R-loop formation, innate immunity, and cell fitness in the context of cancer evolution and therapeutic vulnerability.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Cancer treatments have evolved along three main paradigms; cytotoxic chemotherapy, rationally-targeted agents and immune-based therapies. Still, innate and acquired drug resistance remain key limitations to improving outcomes in advanced cancer patients. With immune-based therapies, it is well documented that responses depend on an appropriate tumor microenvironment (TME). In recent years it has been shown that tumor-intrinsic expression of endogenous, virus-like elements can affect tumor cell viability and the TME by mimicking viral infection and activating pattern recognition receptors (PRR) such as TMEM173/STING and melanoma differentiation associated protein 5 (MDA5) – a process coined “viral mimicry” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>). Suppression of the expression of these repeat elements and viral mimicry may also mediate drug resistance to other therapies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>).</p>
<p>Throughout evolution, the human genome has been modified by waves of viral insertions, and a large fraction of the human genome is therefore composed of repetitive elements and retrotransposons, including interspersed long-terminal repeat (LTR)-based endogenous retroviruses (HERVs), non-LTR-based Short- and Long-Interspersed Nuclear Elements (SINEs and LINEs), as well as centromeric, telomeric and satellite repeats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>). HERV, LINE and SINE elements are mostly silenced in healthy somatic cells but can be deregulated in cancer cells due to DNA hypomethylation in regions containing such elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>). Notably, aberrant expression of these elements is increasingly recognized as playing important roles, not only in cancer evolution and drug resistance but also in the development of other diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>).</p>
<p>Mechanistically, it has been shown that expression of HERVs, LINEs and SINEs can cause cells to appear virally-infected to the immune system (termed “viral mimicry”), in part through the formation of double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs) that are detected by MDA5, thereby triggering a Type I Interferon (IFN-I) response that can decrease tumor cell fitness and increase immunogenicity. Consequently, during tumor evolution such a response may need to be blunted by the acquisition of mutations in genes that promote IFN-I signaling, or by the possible deployment of viral restriction factors or compensatory epigenetic repressive mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>). Interestingly, the latter two non-mutational mechanisms may serendipitously present unique tumor-specific therapeutic opportunities. For example, it has been shown that the A-to-I-editing viral restriction factor ADAR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>) destabilizes inverted repeat SINE elements (IR-Alus) and prevents their detection by MDA5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>). As a result, tumors that harbor increased expression of SINE elements (and consequently ISGs) are highly sensitive to ADAR loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>). Notably, ADAR disruption has also been shown to lead to both intrinsic anti-tumor activity and enhanced immunotherapy response in preclinical mouse models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>) and <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2a</xref>). Previous studies have also demonstrated that regulators of DNA methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>), as well as inhibitors of other epigenetic regulators such as histone methyltransferases (HMTs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>) and histone lysine demethylases (KDMs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>), can induce viral mimicry by reactivating repeat elements and increasing ISG signatures beyond a threshold level of tolerance--thereby affecting cell survival.</p>
<p>Notably, suppression of repeat transcription may also be responsible for the low levels of MHC class I on the surface of tumor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>). Reduced surface MHC I on tumor cells will decrease their intrinsic immunity but also limit responsiveness to therapies such as adoptive T cell therapies. In addition, peptides derived from the repeat genome have also been shown to be presented by tumor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>).</p>
<p>In addition to dsRNA activation of MDA5, viral mimicry can also be mediated through the CGAS/STING pathway, which is initiated by the sensing of DNA or RNA:DNA hybrid species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>). Agonists of the STING pathway are currently being evaluated in clinical trials. The lysine demethylase 5 family (KDM5A-D), which removes histone 3 lysine 4 (H3K4) di- and tri-methyl modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>), has been suggested to blunt viral mimicry in tumor cells through the repression of STING expression or modification of signaling components downstream of STING (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>). Here, we demonstrate that disruption of KDM5 activates viral mimicry in luminal breast cancer cell lines that are responsive to STING agonism. We also show that KDM5 inhibition specifically promotes viral mimicry in tumor cells and not in normal primary breast epithelial cells.</p>
<p>Mechanistically, we demonstrate that inhibition of KDM5 and the resulting increase in H3K4 tri-methylation in repeat regions lead to an increase in R-loop formation. R-loops are three-stranded nucleic acid structures that naturally form during cellular processes such as transcription, replication, and DNA repair when a nascent RNA transcript hybridizes to its DNA template, leaving a loop of single-stranded DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>). Although R- loops are crucial intermediates in normal cellular processes, if not properly regulated, they can also compromise genomic stability, induce DNA damage and trigger inflammatory responses through upregulation of interferon signaling. As such, dysregulation of R-loops and the cGAS-STING pathway have been implicated in both cancer and autoimmune diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>). As an example, it has recently been demonstrated that disruption of the RNA:DNA helicase Senataxin (SETX), which can resolve R-loops, in cancer cells results in accumulation of R-loop-derived cytoplasmic RNA:DNA hybrids that can activate an innate immune response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>). Increases in transcription-replication conflicts (TRCs) and subsequent R-loop formation have also been linked to DNA damage and heightened sensitivity to PARP inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>). Here, we show that KDM5 disruption not only stimulates STING-mediated ISG and AP signatures as well as MHC class I presentation, but also induces a DNA damage response that is independent of the cGAS-STING-Type I IFN axis. In summary, our studies suggest that KDM5 inhibitors hold promise as stand-alone cancer therapies or in combination with immune or DNA damaging cancer therapies.</p>

<title>Luminal breast cancer cell lines display features of “cold” tumors, but viral mimicry can be induced through the STING, MAVS and IFN I pathways</title>
<p>Immune-directed therapies can produce significant clinical benefit for some, but not all, cancer patients. Breast cancers are among the tumor types that are least responsive to immune-based therapies and display low ISG and AP gene expression signatures compared to tumor types that respond well. Among the breast cancer molecular subtypes, luminal breast cancers not only display the lowest ISG and AP gene signatures (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1 a-c</xref>, <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1a-b</xref> and table 1) but also exhibit a lower number of MHC class I molecules on their surface in comparison to triple negative breast cancer cell lines (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1d</xref>) and tumor types that are more immunogenic (data not shown). Collectively, these features are indicative of “cold” tumors and most likely contribute to the poor response to immune-based therapies seen for this breast cancer subtype.</p>

<p>As mentioned above, loss of DNA methylation in genomic repeat regions of cancer cells is an early event in tumor development that potentially contributes to mutations, translocations and expression of oncogenes. However, de-repression of LINE, SINEs, HERVs and other repeat elements also promotes viral mimicry: generation of cytoplasmic NAS and activation of PRRs and IFN-I signaling pathways. Therefore, during tumor evolution various mechanisms can be engaged to counter the negative effects of viral mimicry and create an equilibrium that favors the tumor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>). To better understand the viral mimicry state in luminal breast cancer cells, we first examined a panel of cell lines for their ability to respond to PRR agonists or to IFN-I stimulation (see <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">figure 1e</xref> for a simplified schematic). Using MHC class I surface levels as well as activation of an integrated Interferon-Stimulated Response Element (ISRE) reporter as read-outs, these studies showed that all tested luminal breast tumor cell lines respond to IFNβ (a type I IFN) to varying degrees (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1f</xref>, upper panels and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1g</xref>, left panel, as well as <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">S1c</xref>, left panel and <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">S1e</xref>, upper panel). Most of the luminal lines also respond to MDA5/RIGI agonists, such as Poly-IC, or an <italic>in vitro</italic> transcribed inverted repeat SINE element (IR- Alu) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1f</xref>, lower panel and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1g</xref>, right panel as well as <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">S1d</xref>, right panel and <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">S1e</xref>, bottom 2 panels), but demonstrate a varied response to the STING agonist di-ABZI (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1f</xref>, middle panel and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1g</xref>, middle panel, as well as <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">S1c</xref>, right panel and <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">S1e</xref>, 2nd panel). Collectively, these data show that most of the luminal breast tumor cell lines in this panel have intact signaling pathways downstream of PRRs, suggesting that PRR agonists could be used to increase the ISG and AP signatures and decrease cell fitness in luminal breast cancer cells. However, like Type I IFNs, PRR agonists are likely to indiscriminately induce such phenotypes in both tumor and normal epithelial cells, thereby limiting the therapeutic window for such agents. This is exemplified by an increase in MHC class I surface expression on both tumor cells and normal human mammary epithelial cells (HMECs) in response to STING or RIGI/MDA5 agonists as well as to Type I IFN (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1H</xref>).</p>
<p>Next, we evaluated factors implicated in upstream suppression of STING or MAVS signaling in human tumor cell lines or in suppression of tumor immune responses in mouse models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>), <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2a</xref> for summary). These included the A-to-I editing enzyme ADAR and the histone demethylase KDM5, shown to suppress signaling through MDA5/MAVS and STING, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>). The HCC1428 luminal breast cancer cell line was chosen as a model for most of these studies because it responds well to STING and MDA5 agonists as well as to IFN-I (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1f-h</xref> and <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">S1c-e</xref>). Consistent with the effects of MDA5 agonists, CRISPR-mediated disruption of ADAR in HCC1428 cells (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">figure S2b</xref>) results in an increase in both ISRE-reporter activity (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2a</xref>, upper panel) and surface presentation of MHC class I molecules (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2a</xref>, lower panel). Similar results were also observed in T47D and MCF7 luminal breast cancer lines (data not shown). Likewise, the KDM5-specific inhibitor C48 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>) increases ISRE reporter expression (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2b</xref>, upper panel) as well as ISG and AP signatures (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2c</xref>) in HCC1428 cells. MHC class I surface expression is also increased following C48 exposure in HCC1428 cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">figure 2b</xref> lower panel) and other luminal breast lines (data not shown). As previously shown in other cell lines, inhibition of KDM5 results in viral mimicry mediated through the CGAS/STING pathway (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2d-e</xref> and <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">S2c-e</xref>). Consistent with other studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>), KDM5-dependent effects on viral mimicry in HCC1428 cells is primarily mediated by KDM5C (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figures S2f</xref>- and <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">h</xref>). We also observe that the effect on surface levels of MHC class I is mostly mediated by the KDM5C paralog in the HCC1428 cell line model (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2g</xref>).</p>

<p>To evaluate whether viral mimicry activation and the subsequent increase in surface MHC class I can affect TCR-driven T cell activation, we developed a MCF7:Jurkat T cell co-culture system (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2f</xref>). Briefly, luminal MCF7 breast cancer cells engineered to over-express the NY-ESO1 antigen were cultured with Jurkat cells expressing a NY-ESO1- specific T-cell receptor (TCR) and a luciferase reporter under control of the Nuclear Factor of Activated T cells (NFAT) promoter that is activated upon TCR activation. Using this system, we demonstrated that disruption of ADAR in MCF7:NY-ESO1 cells results in robust activation of the NFAT reporter in co-cultured Jurkat:NY-ESO1 TCR cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2g</xref>). Treatment with the KDM5 inhibitor C48 prior to mixing these cells with NY-ESO1 TCR Jurkat cells results in a dose-dependent increase in NFAT reporter activity (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2h</xref>), which is reversed upon CGAS or STING depletion in MCF7:NYESO1 cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2i</xref>). Similarly to the effects on ISG and AP signatures, induction of the Jurkat NFAT reporter is largely dependent on the disruption of the KDM5B and C paralogs in the MCF7:NY- ESO1 cell line (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2j</xref> and <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">S2f</xref>). Together, these experiments demonstrate that PRR and IFN-I signaling can be augmented in luminal breast cancer cells by direct agonists or by the disruption or inhibition of factors that may repress these pathways upstream.</p>

<title>The effect of KDM5i on cell fitness is not mediated through activation of CGAS/STING or Type I IFN signaling</title>
<p>In addition to increasing the immunogenicity of tumor cells, viral mimicry can also reduce cell fitness. This relationship is well-documented in the MDA5/MAVS dsRNA-sensing pathway. In brief, MDA5/MAVS activation by dsRNA induces Type I IFN signaling through the JAK/STAT pathway, resulting in ISG induction. This includes an increase in Protein Kinase R (PKR), which binds dsRNA and signals through eIF2α to attenuate global translation and drive apoptosis (see <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2i</xref> for model). Consistent with this mechanism of action, treatment with Ruxolitinib, a Janus Kinase (JAK) inhibitor that blocks the IFN-I response, rescues the effects of ADAR disruption not only on ISG induction, MHC Class I presentation, but also overall cell fitness (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2k-l</xref> and <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">S2j</xref>). This direct relationship between ADAR, dsRNA levels, IFN signaling and cell fitness is further illustrated by the observation that cancer cell dependencies on ADAR, as reported in DepMap, correlate strongly with baseline ISG and AP signatures (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">figure S2k</xref> for summary) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>).</p>
<p>In contrast, Ruxolitinib treatment does not reverse KDM5 inhibitor-mediated loss of cell fitness (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2o</xref>) despite blunting induction of ISG/AP signatures and activation of the NFAT reporter in the MCF7:NYESO1/Jurkat co-culture system (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2m-n</xref>; <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">S2l-m</xref>). Similarly, genetic disruption of CGAS or STING upstream of Type I IFN signaling does not reverse C48-mediated cell fitness loss in HCC1428 cells (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2n</xref>) but does abrogate ISG induction (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2d</xref> and <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">S2c-e</xref>). In summary, these data demonstrate that KDM5, unlike ADAR, regulates cancer cell fitness and viral mimicry through distinct mechanisms.</p>

<title>KDM5 inhibition induces viral mimicry and a type I IFN response in luminal breast cancer cells, but not in normal breast epithelial cells</title>
<p>Upstream regulators of PRRs may more selectively affect tumor cells compared to direct PRR agonists. For example, sensitivity to ADAR disruption is observed in tumors that exhibit relatively high ISG signatures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>) and <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2k</xref>), yielding a therapeutic window. To investigate whether KDM5 inhibition would provide a larger therapeutic window than STING agonists, we compared the effect of C48 on ISG and AP signatures as well as cell fitness phenotypes in breast tumor cells and normal breast epithelial cells (HMECs). Although KDM5 inhibition increases H3K4me3 and CGAS/STING levels in both HCC1428 tumor cells and HMECs (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3a</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">b</xref>, <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">S3a</xref>), treatment of HMECs with increasing concentrations of C48 did not induce a dose-dependent increase of MHC class I surface expression in HMECs as compared to luminal breast tumor lines (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3c</xref>, <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figure S3b</xref> and <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">c</xref>).

<p>The STING-independent, adverse effects of KDM5 disruption on cell fitness is also specific to tumor cells and is largely dependent on KDM5C (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3e</xref>, <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">S3f-i</xref> and data not shown). KDM5s have been suggested to play a role in DNA damage and repair (DDR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>). To investigate whether a DDR phenotype contributed to the reduced cell fitness phenotype seen following KDM5 inhibition, we used gamma (γ)-H2AX as a measure of DNA damage. These experiments showed that γ-H2AX staining increases in the HCC1428 tumor cells, but not in HMECs, following exposure to C48 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3f</xref>). Taken together with the data presented in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">figure 2</xref> suggesting that the effect of KDM5 inhibition on cell fitness is independent of STING and IFN-I, these data suggest that the cell fitness phenotype is driven by DNA damage rather than an IFN-I response. Collectively, these data also show that disruption of upstream regulators of PRR signaling, such as KDM5, selectively affects tumor cells, and as such provides a therapeutic window for cancer treatment.</p>

<title>KDM5 inhibition induces R-loop formation in areas of the repetitive genome that harbor increases in H3K4me3</title>
<p>As mentioned, previous studies have suggested that disruption of KDM5 family members activates the STING pathway partially by upregulating the expression of STING itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>). However, our experiments show that STING levels are induced by KDM5 inhibition in both normal and tumor cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">figure 3b</xref>), suggesting that increased levels of STING cannot be the only mechanism by which KDM5 disruption results in induction of innate immune phenotypes. Furthermore, our experiments also suggest that the effect of KDM5 on cell fitness is not mediated through STING or type I IFN (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2o</xref>, <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2n</xref>), but rather through a more complex mechanism involving DDR.</p>
<p>De-regulated control of genomic R-loops (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>) has been shown to result in DNA damage and stimulation of the cGAS-STING pathway via excised RNA:DNA hybrids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>) <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4a</xref> for schematic). While R-loops are crucial regulators of specific biological processes, if not properly regulated, they can also pose a threat to genomic integrity, contributing to cancer progression and chemotherapy resistance; thus, R-loops represent a potential target for novel cancer therapeutics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>). In order to evaluate whether accumulation of R-loops can explain the phenotypes observed following KDM5 disruption in luminal breast cancer cells, we first stained control or C48 treated cells with GFP- tagged RNaseH1 protein, which selectively binds RNA:DNA hybrids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>). These experiments show that KDM5 inhibition results in an increase of GFP+ cells, indicative of increased RNA:DNA hybrid formation in HCC1428 cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4b</xref> for representative images and quantification). This increase is not observed in HMEC cells (data not shown). Furthermore, a partial depletion of XPF, an endonuclease involved in nucleotide excision repair that facilitate the excision of RNA:DNA hybrids from R-loops (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>), attenuates C48- mediated induction of viral mimicry, as measured by ISRE-GFP reporter activity and ISG mRNA expression in HCC1428 cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4c-e</xref> and <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">S4a</xref> left panel). Partial loss of XPF also attenuates the dose-dependent increase of MHCI component mRNA expression and surface levels induced by C48 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4d</xref>, right panel, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4f</xref>, and <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">S4a</xref> right panel). Collectively, these data suggest that the viral mimicry phenotypes induced by KDM5 inhibition in sensitive breast cancer cell lines are initiated by an increase in the generation of R-loop-derived RNA:DNA hybrid species.</p>

<p>Transcription replication conflicts (TRCs), often magnified in cancer, occur when the processes of DNA replication and transcription co-occur on the same DNA template and are intricately linked to the initiation/persistence of R loops (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>). Transcriptional output is linked to epigenetic modifications, and it has previously been shown that the <italic>de novo</italic> DNA methyltransferase DNMT3b and other epigenetic regulators may mechanistically restrict R-loop mediated DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>). Increases in H3K4 methylation is linked to increases in transcriptional output (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>), possibly creating an epigenetic environment conducive to an increase in R-loops in tumor cells that already display an increase in TRC. To explore a possible relationship between C48-induced increases in H3K4 trimethylation and genomic R-loops, we first performed Cleavage Under Targets and Tagmentation (CUT-and-Tag) experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>) using an H3K4me3-specific antibody. This method combines antibody-targeted cleavage by Tn5 transposase with parallel DNA sequencing to evaluate regions in the genome that display changes as detected by the antibody used. KDM5 inhibition induces global changes in H3K4me3; therefore, we added equal numbers of <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> spike-in nuclei to both DMSO and C48- treated samples to enable downstream normalization (see <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figure S4b</xref> for experimental set-up). Indeed, mapping reads to the <italic>Drosophila</italic> genome reveals that C48-treated samples consistently harbor less <italic>Drosophila</italic> reads as compared to DMSO-treated samples, instead of the expected equal counts (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figure S4c</xref>); therefore, H3K4me3 peaks would be undercounted in C48-treated samples without spike-in normalization (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figure S4d</xref> and <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">e</xref> as examples). Therefore, peak counts were normalized by the spike-in reads prior to differential peak calling. As expected, we observed an increase in H3K4me3 in promoter regions upon C48 treatment of HCC1428 cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4g</xref> and <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">S4e</xref>, yellow bar). Additionally, we observed an increase in H3K4me3 in intergenic and intronic regions, which often harbor insertions of repetitive elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>), in C48-treated HCC1428 samples (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4g</xref> and s4e, blue and orange bars). Given that R-loop generation has been described in telomeric, centromeric and other repeats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>), we expanded the analysis of H3K4 trimethylation to repeat regions. This analysis revealed increased H3K4me3 reads mapping to both sub-telomeric and centromeric regions following C48 treatment of HCC1428 and other luminal breast cancer cell lines (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4h-i</xref> and data not shown). Interestingly, KDM5 has previously been identified as a telomere-associated protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>).</p>
<p>In addition to observing C48-mediated increases of H3K4me3 specifically in telomeric repeats, when subdividing the genome into annotated repetitive regions and non-repeat regions, we observed that there was a significant increase in H3K4me3 reads mapping to repeat regions in general in HCC1428 cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4j</xref>). The results of these CUT-and-Tag experiments are consistent with those derived from the analysis of H3K4me3 reads from chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIPseq) experiments (data not shown). We subsequently separated the analysis by repeat classes present in the human genome, and observed that SINE elements exhibited the highest coverage of H3K4me3 in C48- treated HCC1428 samples and were significantly increased in comparison to untreated samples (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4k</xref> and <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">S4f</xref>, pink, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4l</xref>). We also observed increases in H3K4me3 in other genomic repeats such as LINEs and LTRs in HCC1428 cells treated with C48 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4k</xref> and <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">S4f</xref>, yellow and dark blue respectively, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4l</xref>) and in other luminal breast cancer cell lines following C48 treatment (data not shown). Further analysis distillation of repeat classes into SINE, LINE and LTR subfamilies revealed that KDM5 inhibition results in increased H3K4me3 mainly in the AluY subfamily, as well as LINE1/LINE2 subfamilies and a few LTR subfamilies (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Fig S4g</xref>).</p>
<p>To investigate a possible relationship between genomic regions that harbor increased H3K4me3 upon KDM5 inhibition and R-loop prevalence, we performed CUT-and-Tag experiments using an antibody (S9.6) that detects RNA:DNA hybrids in the genome. As in the H3K4me3 CUT-and-Tag experiments, <italic>Drosophila</italic> “spike-ins” were added and used for normalization of the data (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figure S4b</xref> for outline). Similar to what was observed for H3K4me3, KDM5 inhibition increases S9.6 reads mapping to telomeric and centromeric repeats in HCC1428 cells (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figure S4h</xref>). Since we also observed H3K4me3 increases mapping to other repeat classes following KDM5 inhibitor exposure, we expanded the S9.6 CUT-and-Tag analysis to the rest of the repeat genome. As a group, repeats that harbor increased H3K4me3 also display a significant increase in S9.6 reads upon C48 treatment (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figure S4i</xref>, middle panel) and this increase is greater than what is observed in repeats that do not display increases in H3K4me3 (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figure S4i</xref>, left panel). Collectively, these data suggest that KDM5 inhibition increases R-loop formation in repetitive regions of breast cancer genomes. Repeats that harbor KDM5 inhibitor-mediated increases in both H3K4me3 and S9.6 reads traverse multiple repeat classes, including SINEs, LINEs and LTRs (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4m</xref>). Additional analysis of RNA sequencing data also suggest that the most significant increases of S9.6 reads are observed in repeat classes that not only display elevated H3K4me3 levels, but also exhibit higher transcriptional activity following KDM5 inhibition (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figure S4i</xref>, right panel). Together, these analyses demonstrate that KDM5 inhibition and subsequent increases in H3K4me3 correlate with an increased prevalence of R-loops in genomic repeats in tumor cells.</p>
<p>Collectively, we show that the KDM5 demethylases regulate viral mimicry and DNA damage in luminal breast cancer cells. Mechanistically, KDM5 inhibition increases R-loop prevalence in repetitive genomic regions, triggering activation of the CGAS/STING pathway and consequent upregulation of ISGs and MHC class I surface expression. KDM5 inhibitors also reduce cell fitness, not mediated through induction of type I IFN signaling, but rather because of R-loop-generated DNA damage (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>). As mentioned above, R-loops can form during transcription and have the potential to impede replication fork progression, leading to replication stress. This interference can result in DNA damage, necessitating repair mechanisms to maintain genomic integrity. Conversely, replication stress itself might induce conditions conducive to R-loop formation, suggesting a bidirectional relationship. The study of chromatin dynamics and its impact on DNA damage and repair mechanisms has garnered significant attention in recent years. Several studies have implicated KDM5 demethylases in DDR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>) and a recent study revealed a potential role for KDM5 in maintaining the delicate balance between transcriptional regulation and replication to preserve DNA integrity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>). Collectively, such observations suggest that KDM5 inhibitors, or other factors whose disruption or inhibition results in tumor-specific increases in R-loops, could pair well with PARP inhibitors and other DNA damage-promoting drugs.</p>

<caption><title>Model. The KDM5 family of epigenetic regulatory enzymes reduces R-loop formation in genomic repeat regions in luminal breast cancer cells.</title>
<p>Genetic disruption or chemical inhibition of KDM5 causes R-loop-mediated DNA damage in luminal breast cancer cells. R-loop generated RNA:DNA hybrids also result in the activation of the CGAS/STING pathway, increasing ISG and AP signatures as well as cell surface MHCI, which may enhance interactions with the TME. Importantly, KDM5 inhibition does not result in DNA damage or activation of the CGAS/STING pathway in normal breast epithelial cells, suggesting that KDM5 inhibitors present a wider therapeutic window in this setting than STING agonists or type I Interferons.

<p>Importantly, we also show that KDM5 inhibition selectively affects cell fitness and immunogenicity phenotypes of cancer cells without having similar effects in primary breast epithelial cells, potentially resulting in a therapeutic window for KDM5 inhibitors or degraders as single agents. Our data also show that KDM5 disruption or inhibition can activate T cells in a co-culture system. Important for possible combinations with TME enhancers, preliminary data suggest that there are no major negative effects of KDM5 inhibitors on primary T cells or macrophages (data not shown). The STING-independent KDM5 inhibitor effect on cell fitness in luminal breast cancer cells and previous observations that KDM5 disruption affects the survival of drug-tolerant persister cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>) suggest that there could be combinatorial potential, not only with agents that affect the TME, but also with other standard-of-care agents. Future studies will have to explore the relevance of these findings in other cancer subtypes. Preliminary studies suggest that hematologic cancer cells that are sensitive to KDM5 inhibitors also display markers of type I IFN signaling activation (data not shown). Collectively, these findings expand on KDM5 inhibitors or degraders as promising candidates for single-agent cancer therapy, with further potential to enhance the efficacy of immunotherapies as well as DNA damaging agents.</p>

<p>This study presents a <bold>valuable</bold> finding that KDM5 inhibition activates the interferon response and antigen presentation genes in breast cancer cells through R-loops. The evidence supporting the claims of the authors is <bold>solid</bold>, although the inclusion of further in vivo studies displaying the effects of KDM5 inhibitors on the immunotherapy responses of breast tumors would have strengthened the study. The work will be of interest to scientists working in the field of breast cancer immunotherapy.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this manuscript, Lau et al reported that KDM5 inhibition in luminal breast cancer cells results in R-loop-mediated DNA damage, reduced cell fitness and an increase in ISG and AP signatures as well as cell surface Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) class I, mediated by RNA:DNA hybrid activation of the CGAS/STING pathway.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>More importantly, they have shown that KDM5 inhibition does not result in DNA damage or activation of the CGAS/STING pathway in normal breast epithelial cells. This suggests that KDM5 inhibitors may enable a wide therapeutic window in this setting, as compared to STING agonists or Type I Interferons. Their findings provide new insights into the interplay between epigenetic regulation of genomic repeats, R-loop formation, innate immunity, and cell fitness in the context of cancer evolution and therapeutic vulnerability.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>More thorough analyses would be appreciated.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this manuscript, the authors investigated how the type-I interferon response (ISG) and antigen presentation (AP) pathways are repressed in luminal breast cancer cells and how this repression can be overcome. They found that a STING agonist can reactivate these pathways in breast cancer cells, but it also does so in normal cells, suggesting that this is not a good way to create a therapeutic window. Depletion of ADAR and inhibition of KDM5 also activate ISG and AP genes. The activation of ISG and AP genes is dependent on cGAS/STING and the JAK kinase. Interestingly, although both ADAR depletion and KDM5 inhibition activate ISG and AP genes, their effects on cell fitness are different. Furthermore, KDM5 inhibitor selectively activates ISG and AP genes in tumor cells but not normal cells, arguing that it may create a larger therapeutic window than the STING agonist. These results also suggest that KDM5 inhibition may activate ISG and AP genes in a way different from ADAR loss, and this process may affect tumor cell fitness independently of the activation of ISG and AP genes.</p>
<p>The authors further showed that KDM5 inhibition increases R-loops and DNA damage in tumor cells, and XPF, a nuclease that cuts R-loops, is required for the activation of ISG and AP genes. Using H3K4me3 CUT&amp;RUN, they found that KMD5 inhibition results in increased H3K4me3 not only at genes, but also at repetitive elements including SINE, LINE, LTR, telomeres, and centromeres. Using S9.6 CUT&amp;TAG, they confirmed that R-loops are increased at SINE, LINE, and LTR repeated with increased H3K4me3. Together, the results of this study suggest that KMD5 inhibition leads to H3K4me3 and R-loop accumulation in repetitive elements, which induces DNA damage and cGAS/STING activation and subsequently activates AP genes. This provides an exciting approach to stimulate the anti-tumor immunity against breast tumors.</p>
<p>KDM5 inhibition activates interferon and antigen presentation genes through R-loops.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Overall, this study was carefully designed and executed. This is a new approach to make breast tumors &quot;hot&quot; for anti-tumor immunity.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Future in vivo studies are needed to show the effects of KDM5 inhibitors on the immunotherapy responses of breast tumors.</p>
