<title>Abstract</title><p>The survival of hosts during infections relies on their ability to mount effective molecular and behavioral immune responses. Despite extensive research on these defense strategies in various species, including the model organism <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, the neural mechanisms underlying their interaction remain poorly understood. Previous studies have highlighted the role of neural G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) in regulating both immunity and pathogen avoidance, which is particularly dependent on aerotaxis. To address this knowledge gap, we conducted a screen of mutants in neuropeptide receptor family genes. We found that loss-of-function mutations in <italic>npr-15</italic> activated immunity while suppressing pathogen avoidance behavior. Through further analysis, NPR-15 was found to regulate immunity by modulating the activity of key transcription factors, namely GATA/ELT-2 and TFEB/HLH-30. Surprisingly, the lack of pathogen avoidance of <italic>npr-15</italic> mutant animals was not influenced by oxygen levels. Moreover, our studies revealed that the amphid sensory neuron ASJ is involved in mediating the immune and behavioral responses orchestrated by NPR-15. Additionally, NPR-15 was found to regulate avoidance behavior via the TRPM gene, GON-2, which may sense the intestinal distension caused by bacterial colonization to elicit pathogen avoidance. Our study contributes to a broader understanding of host defense strategies and mechanisms underlining the interaction between molecular and behavioral immune responses.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Hosts employ multiple defense mechanisms to combat infections, including molecular immune defenses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>) and behavioral defense responses to invading pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>). Overall, these strategies are conserved across species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>), but their relationship and mechanistic interplay are not yet fully elucidated. While the immunological defense response is effective, it is metabolically costly and may lead to inflammatory damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>). On the other hand, the avoidance behavioral response serves as a crucial first line of defense, enabling hosts to prevent or minimize contact with pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>). Although both immune and behavioral responses to pathogen infection are well documented in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>), the relationship between these survival strategies remains poorly understood.</p>
<p><italic>C. elegans</italic> is a valuable model organism for studying the genetic mechanisms that control host immune and behavioral responses to pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>). Although <italic>C. elegans</italic> lacks adaptive immunity, part of its innate immune response comprises evolutionarily conserved pathways and immune effectors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>). <italic>C. elegans</italic> has been widely used in research studies to investigate these pathways due to its well-defined nervous system and genetic tractability, making it an ideal model organism to explore pathways that are critical to immunity and avoidance behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>). Notably, intestinal changes triggered by bacterial pathogen colonization activate the DAF-7/TGF-β pathway and the G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) NPR-1 pathway, which also regulates aerotaxis behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>).</p>
<p>To uncover mechanisms that control immune and behavioral responses to invading pathogens independently of aerotaxis, we focused on studying mutants in <italic>npr</italic> genes that have not been previously linked to either host strategy against pathogen infection. Our investigation revealed that loss-of-function mutations in the NPR-15 encoding genes enhanced pathogen resistance when infected by Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacterial pathogens. Intriguingly, <italic>npr-15</italic> mutants exhibited a lack of pathogen avoidance behavior that was found to be independent of oxygen sensation. These findings point towards the involvement of a novel mechanism in the regulation of immune response and avoidance behavior.</p>
<p>Further analysis unveiled that the resistance to pathogen infection in <italic>npr-15</italic> mutants is mediated by the transcription factors GATA/ELT-2 and TFEB/HLH-30. These evolutionarily conserved transcription factors play vital roles in regulating immunity in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>). Additionally, we discovered that NPR-15 controls avoidance behavior through the intestinal-expressed transient receptor potential melastatin (TRPM) ion channel, GON-2, which has recently been demonstrated to modulate avoidance behavior in Gram-positive bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>). Moreover, our results indicate that the amphid sensory neuron, ASJ, plays a crucial role in the interplay between immune response and avoidance behavior. These findings provide insights into the neural mechanisms that control immunity against bacterial infections and pathogen avoidance behavior.</p>

<title>NPR-15 loss-of-function enhances pathogen resistance and inhibits avoidance behavior independently of aerotaxis</title>
<p>Out of 34 mutants in <italic>npr</italic> genes that were not previously linked to the control immunity (Table S1A), only animals lacking NPR-15 [<italic>npr-15(tm12539)</italic> and <italic>npr-15(ok1626)</italic> null animals] exhibited enhanced survival against <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa-</italic>mediated killing compared to wild-type (WT) animals (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>, S1A and Table S1B). Furthermore, we found that the <italic>npr-15(tm12539)</italic> animals exhibited less visible bacterial colonization and significantly reduced colony-forming units compared to WT animals (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B-C</xref>). The enhanced resistance to pathogen of <italic>npr-15(ok1626)</italic> animals appears to be universal, as the mutants were also found to be resistant to additional human pathogens, including Gram-negative <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> strain 1344 and Gram-positive <italic>Enterococcus faecalis</italic> strain OG1RF and <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> strain NCTCB325 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D-F</xref>), suggesting that NPR-15 suppresses defense against bacterial pathogens in general. When exposed to live <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, the primary food source of <italic>C. elegans</italic> in the laboratory, <italic>npr-15(tm12539)</italic> animals exhibited increased lifespan compared to WT animals (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G</xref>). However, there were no significant differences in longevity between <italic>npr-15(tm12539)</italic> and WT animals when they were exposed to lawns of <italic>E. coli</italic> that were rendered non-proliferating by ultraviolet light (UV) treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1H</xref>). Expression of <italic>npr-15</italic> under the control of its own promoter rescued the enhanced survival of <italic>npr-15(tm12539)</italic> animals to different bacterial pathogens (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1A-G</xref>), indicating that the functional loss of NPR-15 enhanced the animal’s survival against live bacteria.</p>

<p>Considering that <italic>C. elegans</italic> exhibits avoidance behavior when encountering certain pathogenic bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>), we examined the lawn occupancy of <italic>npr-15(tm12539)</italic> and WT animals on the partial lawn of <italic>S. aureus</italic> cultured in the center of an agar plate (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1I</xref>). Unexpectedly, we found that <italic>npr-15(tm12539)</italic> exhibited significantly reduced pathogen avoidance when exposed to <italic>S. aureus</italic> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1J</xref>). We also compared the re-occupancy of the lawn exhibited by WT and <italic>npr-15(tm12539)</italic> animals and found no differences in their re-occupancy (Figure S1B). Interestingly, we noticed that the variation in lawn occupancy is greater in WT than in <italic>npr-15(tm12539)</italic> animals across experiments (Table S2), which suggests that the strong lack of avoidance of <italic>npr-15(tm12539)</italic> somehow counteracts the experimental variation. We also found that <italic>npr-15(tm12539)</italic> exhibited reduced learned avoidance compared to WT animals (Figure S1C).</p>
<p>To investigate whether aerotaxis played a role in the lack of avoidance of <italic>S. aureus</italic> exhibited by <italic>npr-15(tm12539)</italic>, we studied lawn occupancy in the presence of 8% oxygen. As shown in Figure S1D, exposure to 8% oxygen to <italic>npr-15(tm12539)</italic> animals did not rescue the lack of avoidance to <italic>S. aureus</italic>, although it did rescue the lack of avoidance of <italic>npr-1</italic> mutants. Moreover, the survival of <italic>npr-15(tm12539)</italic> animals on full-lawn assays, where agar plates were completely covered by pathogenic bacteria to eliminate the possibility of pathogen avoidance, was significantly higher than that of WT animals (Figure S1E-F). These findings suggest that NPR-15 suppresses pathogen resistance and enhances avoidance behavior in response to pathogen infection, independently of oxygen concentrations.</p>
<p>Because <italic>C. elegans</italic> pharyngeal pumping directly affects bacterial intake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>), we asked whether the resistance to infections and reduced pathogen avoidance behavior in <italic>npr-15(tm12539)</italic> animals could be attributed to a decrease in pathogen intake. We found that <italic>npr-15(tm12539)</italic> animals exhibited pumping rates comparable to that of WT animals (Figure S1G), indicating that the dose of pathogens is similar in both cases. Moreover, it has recently been demonstrated that bacterial accumulation in animals defective in the defecation motor program (DMP) causes intestinal distension that elicits a robust immune response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>) and modulates pathogen avoidance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>). However, we found that the defecation cycle of <italic>npr-15(tm12539)</italic> animals is indistinguishable from that of WT animals (Figure S1H). Taken together, our results show that NPR-15 loss-of-function enhances pathogen resistance and inhibits avoidance behavior, suggesting NPR-15 suppresses molecular immunity while activating behavioral immunity.</p>

<title>The loss of NPR-15 leads to the upregulated immune and neuropeptide genes</title>
<p>To understand the immune mechanisms controlled by NPR-15 in defense against pathogen exposure, we conducted transcriptomic analyses to identify dysregulated genes in <italic>npr-15(tm12539)</italic> compared to WT animals (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref> and Table S3). To identify gene groups that were controlled by NPR-15, we performed an unbiased gene enrichment analysis using a WormBase enrichment analysis tool (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://wormbase.org/tools/enrichment/tea/tea.cgi">https://wormbase.org/tools/enrichment/tea/tea.cgi</ext-link>) that is specific for <italic>C. elegans</italic> gene data analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>). The study revealed 10 ontology clusters with high enrichment scores of vital biological functions for upregulated and downregulated genes in <italic>npr-15(tm12539)</italic> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>, S2). Overall, the gene expression data showed significant upregulation of immune/defense response and neuropeptide signaling pathway genes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). Genes associated with synaptic signaling, ligand-gated channel activity, lipid metabolism, and response to biotic stimuli were also upregulated in <italic>npr-15(tm12539)</italic> animals.</p>

Our analysis revealed a high enrichment of pathways crucial for <italic>C. elegans</italic> defense against bacterial infections, including the ELT-2, HLH-30, PMK-1, and DAF-2/DAF-16 insulin pathways (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref> and Table S4) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>). Notably, we observed that several of the PMK-1, HLH-30, and DAF-16-dependent genes were also controlled by ELT-2 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>), suggesting a potentially major role of ELT-2-dependent genes in the enhanced resistance to the pathogen phenotype of <italic>npr-15(tm12539)</italic> animals. To validate these findings, we performed Quantitative PCR (qPCR) and confirmed the upregulation of ELT-2-dependent immune genes such as <italic>dct-17</italic>, C29F3.7, T19D12.4, C32H11.4, C34H4.1 and <italic>clec-86</italic> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>).

These transcriptomic and gene analyses indicate that NPR-15 primarily regulates <italic>C. elegans</italic> defense against bacterial infections by inhibiting immune genes, several of which are controlled by ELT-2, HLH-30, and PMK-1.</p>

<p>To investigate whether the enhanced resistance to pathogen infection of <italic>npr-15(tm12539)</italic> animals is due to the upregulation of immune genes, we examined the role of RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated suppression of the immune pathways shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>.

Partial suppression of pathogen resistance in <italic>npr-15(tm12539)</italic> animals was observed with <italic>hlh-30</italic> RNAi (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). Furthermore, when both <italic>hlh-30</italic> and <italic>elt-2</italic> were inactivated in <italic>npr-15(tm12539)</italic> animals and were exposed to <italic>S. aureus</italic>, their susceptibility to infection was comparable to that of <italic>elt-2</italic> RNAi animals (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>). However, <italic>pmk-1</italic>, <italic>daf-16</italic> RNAi failed to suppress the pathogen resistance of <italic>npr-15(tm12539)</italic> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D-E</xref>). To confirm these findings, we crossed mutants in the aforementioned immune regulators to <italic>npr-15(tm12539)</italic> animals and exposed them to <italic>S. aureus</italic> (Figure S3A-C). We also studied the aforementioned immune pathways in the response of <italic>npr-15(tm12539)</italic> animals to <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> (Figure S3D-F).

<p>Because NPR-15 is expressed in six sensory neuronal cells (ASG, ASI, ASJ, ASE, AFD, and AWC) as well as an interneuron, AVK (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>), we studied whether the NPR-15-expressing cells could control the defense response against pathogen infection. Firstly, we examined the neuronal connectome and communication between the NPR-15-expressing cell and found well-established synaptic connections between all the sensory neurons (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). Next, we asked if NPR-15 could be acting in a neuron-intrinsic manner to control immune response. To address this question, we specifically inactivated <italic>npr</italic>-15 in neurons and the intestine using tissue-specific RNAi strains and assessed the survival of the animals after <italic>S. aureus</italic> infection. Unlike intestine-specific RNAi (strain MGH171) (Figure S4A), neural-specific RNAi (strain TU3401) of NPR-15 resulted in a pathogen resistance phenotype similar to that of <italic>npr-15(tm12539)</italic> animals (Figure S4B). This finding was further supported by rescuing NPR-15 under the control of a pan-neuronal promoter and exposing the animals to <italic>S. aureus</italic>. The results demonstrated that pan-neuronal promoter-driven expression of NPR-15 rescued the enhanced survival phenotype of <italic>npr-15(tm12539)</italic> animals (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>). These results suggest that NPR-15 suppresses immunity through the nervous system. We next studied the specific NPR-15-expressing neuronal cells (ASG, ASI, ASJ, ASE, AFD, AWC) that could control the defense response against pathogen infection. To identify the neuronal cells responsible for the NPR-15-mediated immune control, we crossed strains lacking the neurons with <italic>npr-15(tm12539)</italic> animals and studied their effect on defense against pathogen infection (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C-E</xref> and S4C-E). We found that ASJ(-) animals exhibited resistance to pathogen-mediated killing similar to that of <italic>npr-15(tm12539)</italic> animals (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>). Although the ASG(-) and ASE(-) neuron-ablated strains demonstrated pathogen resistance phenotype, there is a significant difference compared to that of <italic>npr-15(tm12539)</italic> animals (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D-E</xref>). Hence, we further confirmed the role of NPR-15/ASJ neurons in suppressing immunity by rescuing NPR-15 on ASJ unique promoter and performing survival experiments with the rescued strain. Results showed that the ASJ-specific rescue of NPR-15 successfully blocked the enhanced survival of <italic>npr-15(tm12539)</italic> animals (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>). We also quantified the expression of immune genes and found that they were upregulated in ASJ(-) animals (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4G</xref>). Collectively, these findings suggest that NPR-15 controls immunity in a manner similar to that of ASJ neurons.</p>

<title>The lack of avoidance behavior by NPR-15 loss-of-function is independent of immunity and neuropeptide genes</title>
<p>Having established the upregulation of immune genes in <italic>npr-15(tm12539)</italic> animals compared to WT animals (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B-F</xref> and Table S4), we determine whether the reduced pathogen avoidance of <italic>npr-15(tm12539)</italic> animals could be attributed to the upregulation of immune pathways. To investigate this, we employed RNAi to suppress immune transcription factors/regulators and evaluated their impact on pathogen avoidance behavior in both WT and <italic>npr-15(tm12539)</italic> animals. Our results indicate that none of the tested immune regulators (<italic>elt-2, pmk-1, daf-16,</italic> and <italic>hlh-30</italic>) were able to suppress the lack of pathogen avoidance behavior observed in response to <italic>S. aureus</italic> (Figure S5A-D). Furthermore, we inactivated immune genes that are not controlled by the immune regulators tested above, but none of them were able to suppress the lack of avoidance behavior in the <italic>npr-15(tm12539</italic>) animals (Table S5). Given the possibility of functional redundancy among these genes, we cannot rule out the possibility that different combinations may play a role in controlling avoidance behavior. These findings indicate that the avoidance behavior observed in <italic>npr-15(tm12539)</italic> is independent of individual immune genes upregulated in <italic>npr-15(tm12539</italic>) animals.</p>
<p>Additionally, previous studies have shown that neuropeptides expressed in the intestine can modulate avoidance behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>), and we found that neuropeptides are among the most highly upregulated genes in <italic>npr-15(tm12539)</italic> animals (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref> and Table S6). To study whether an intestinal signal may act through NPR-15 to regulate avoidance, we inactivated the upregulated intestinal neuropeptide genes in <italic>npr-15(tm12539)</italic> animals. Our experiments revealed that none of the inactivated intestinal-expressed neuropeptides were able to suppress the lack of avoidance behavior of <italic>npr-15(tm12539)</italic> animals in response to <italic>S. aureus</italic> (Figure S5E and Table S5). Therefore, it can be concluded that the absence of avoidance behavior by loss of NPR-15 function is independent of both immune and intestinal neuropeptide signaling pathways.</p>

<p>Having demonstrated that NPR-15 controls immune response via sensory neurons, ASJ (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>, 4F-G), we sought to identify the neurons involved in the lack of avoidance behavior to <italic>S. aureus</italic> observed in <italic>npr-15(tm12539)</italic> animals.

<p>Because transient receptor potential melastatin (TRPM) ion channels, GON-2 and GTL-2, are required for pathogen avoidance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>), we studied whether they may be part of the NPR-15 pathway that controls pathogen avoidance. We inactivated <italic>gon-2</italic> and <italic>gtl-2</italic> in <italic>npr-15(tm12539)</italic> animals and WT animals. Our findings showed that only <italic>gon-2</italic> null animals, but not <italic>gtl-2</italic>, exhibited pathogen avoidance behavior similar to that of <italic>npr-15(tm12539)</italic> animals (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5H-I</xref>). This suggests that both NPR-15 and GON-2 may function in a shared pathway to regulated pathogen avoidance behavior. As it has been previously demonstrated that GON-2 modulates avoidance behavior through the intestine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>), we confirmed the role of intestinal-expressed GON-2 in pathogen avoidance by inactivating <italic>gon-2</italic> in an RNAi intestine-specific strain (MGH171), as well as in an RNAi neuron-specific strain TU3401) that was used as a control. These animals were exposed to <italic>S. aureus</italic> to study their lawn occupancy. Our results showed that the inactivation of <italic>gon-2</italic> in MGH171 and MGH171;<italic>npr-15(tm12539)</italic> (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5J</xref>), but not in TU3401 (Figure S6), exhibited comparable avoidance behaviors to that of <italic>npr-15(tm12539)</italic> animals. These results suggest that NPR-15 acts through the intestinal TRPM channel GON-2 to control pathogen avoidance behavior. Since we have previously shown that only ASJ(-) animals among other neuron-ablated strains exhibit a similar avoidance behavior to <italic>npr-15(tm12539</italic>) animals (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B, 5D-G</xref>), we investigated whether NPR-15 control of avoidance behavior towards <italic>S. aureus</italic> in a GON-2-dependent manner involves ASJ. We used RNAi to inactivate <italic>gon-2</italic> in ASJ(-), ASJ(-);<italic>npr-15(tm152799)</italic>, <italic>npr-15(tm12539)</italic>, and WT animals before exposing them to <italic>S. aureus</italic> to assay their lawn occupancy. Our results showed that the avoidance behavior of ASJ(-);<italic>gon-2</italic> is comparable to that of ASJ(-), ASJ(-);<italic>npr-15(tm12539)</italic>, and <italic>gon-2</italic> null animals when exposed to <italic>S. aureus</italic> (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5K</xref>). These results suggest that NPR-15 controls <italic>S. aureus</italic> avoidance in a GON-2-dependent manner via the ASJ neuron. In summary, the neuronal GPCR/NPR-15 plays a dual role: suppressing the immune response and enhancing avoidance behavior towards <italic>S. aureus</italic> through sensory neurons, specifically ASJ. The control of immunity against the pathogen <italic>S. aureus</italic> is dependent on the ELT-2 and HLH-30 transcription factors, while the control of avoidance behavior is GON-2-dependent and mediated through the intestine (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>GPCRs play a crucial role in neuronal and non-neuronal tissues in shaping both immune and avoidance behavioral responses toward invading pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>). In this study, we investigated the dual functionality of GPCR/NPR-15 in regulating molecular innate immunity and pathogen avoidance behavior independently of aerotaxis. Additionally, we aimed to understand the mechanism by which the nervous system controls the interplay between these crucial survival strategies in response to pathogenic threats. Our findings indicate that NPR-15 suppresses immune responses against different pathogen infections by inhibiting the activity of the GATA/ELT-2 and HLH-30 immune transcription regulators. Moreover, we found that the control of the pathogen avoidance behavior by NPR-15 is independent of aerotaxis and dependent on intestinal GON-2. Furthermore, we demonstrated that NPR-15 controls the immunity-behavioral response via an amphid sensory neuron, ASJ, in response to <italic>S. aureus</italic> infection.</p>
<p>ASJ neurons are known to regulate different biological functions such as lifespan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>), dauer activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>), head-directed light avoidance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>), and food search (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>). We show here that ASJ neurons play a role in the control of immune and behavioral responses against pathogen infection through GPCR/NPR-15. Our research additionally indicates that the regulation of NPR-15-mediated avoidance is not influenced by intestinal immune and neuropeptide genes. Given the potential for functional redundancy and our focus on genes upregulated in the absence of NPR-15, we cannot entirely rule out the possibility that unexamined immune effectors or neuropeptides, not transcriptionally controlled by NPR-15, might be involved. Different intestinal signals may also participate in the NPR-15 pathway that controls pathogen avoidance.</p>
<p>Other neural GPCRs have also been linked to the control of innate immunity in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>). For example, the octopamine receptor OCTR-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>), the olfactory learning receptor OLRN-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>), and the D1-like dopamine receptor DOP-4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>) function in ASH/ASI, AWC, and ASG neurons, respectively. GPCRs that are neuropeptide receptors, such as NPR-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>), NPR-9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>), and NPR-8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>), also function in neurons to control immunity. In common, these GPCRs regulate innate immunity via the p38/PMK-1 MAPK pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>). In contrast, NPR-15 functions in ASJ neurons to suppress immune defense against bacterial infections by inhibiting the transcriptional activity of ELT-2 and HLH-30. Two of these GPCRs, NPR-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>) and PCDR-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>), also play a role in mediating pathogen avoidance. While OCTR-1-expressing neurons ASI play a role in avoidance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>), the specific role of OCTR-1 in ASH and ASI neurons remains unclear.</p>
<p>Our findings shed light on the role of NPR-15 in the control of the immune response. NPR-15 seems to suppress specific immune genes while activating pathogen avoidance behavior to minimize potential tissue damage and the metabolic energy cost associated with activating the molecular immune response against pathogen infections. Overall, the control of immune activation is essential for maintaining homeostasis and preventing excessive tissue damage caused by an overly aggressive and energy-costly response against pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref>).</p>

The host relies on behavioral responses to minimize or completely avoid pathogen exposure, effectively preventing the activation of the immune pathways and production of immune effector molecules, which can be metabolically costly. Moreover, the sustained and prolonged activation of the molecular immune system can have detrimental effects on the host. Understanding the organismal control of molecular and behavioral immune responses to pathogens can provide valuable insights into universal mechanisms used across species to maintain homeostasis during infections.</p>

<title>Generation of transgenic <italic>C. elegans</italic></title>
<p>To generate <italic>npr-15</italic> rescue animals, the DNA <italic>npr-</italic>15 alongside its promoter was amplified from the genomic DNA of Bristol N2 <italic>C. elegans</italic> adult worms. Plasmid pPD95_77_<italic>Pnpr-15_npr-15</italic> was constructed by linearization of plasmid pPD95_77 using HindIII and SalI restriction digestion enzymes. The amplified <italic>Pnpr-15::npr-15</italic> DNA was cloned behind its native promoter in the plasmid pPD95_77, between HindIII and SalI sites. For the neuronal rescue strain, the plasmid pPD95_77_<italic>Prab-3_npr-15</italic> was constructed by cloning amplified <italic>npr-15</italic> DNA into BamHI/KpnI digested pPD95_77_<italic>Prab-3</italic> under the promoter of <italic>rab-3</italic>.

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Otarigho et al. presented a convincing study revealing that in C. elegans, the neuropeptide Y receptor GPCR/NPR-15 mediates both molecular and behavioral immune responses to pathogen attack. Previously, three npr genes were found to be involved in worm defense. In this study, the authors screened mutants in the remaining npr genes against P. aeruginosa-mediated killing and found that npr-15 loss-of-function improved worm survival. npr-15 mutants also exhibited enhanced resistance to other pathogenic bacteria but displayed significantly reduced avoidance to S. aureus, independent of aerotaxis, pathogen intake and defecation. The enhanced resistance in npr-15 mutant worms was attributed to upregulation of immune and neuropeptide genes, many of which were controlled by the transcription factors ELT-2 and HLH-30. The authors found that NPR-15 regulates avoidance behavior via the TRPM gene, GON-2, which has a known role in modulating avoidance behavior through the intestine. The authors further showed that both NPR-15-dependent immune and behavioral responses to pathogen attack were mediated by the NPR-15-expressing neurons ASJ. Overall, the authors discovered that the NPR-15/ASJ neural circuit may regulate distinct defense mechanisms against pathogens under different circumstances. This study provides novel and useful information to researchers in the fields of neuroimmunology and C. elegans research.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>1. This study uncovered specific molecules and neuronal cells that regulate both molecular immune defense and behavior defense against pathogen attack and indicate that the same neural circuit may regulate distinct defense mechanisms under different circumstances. This discovery is significant because it not only reveals regulatory mechanisms of different defense strategies but also suggests how C. elegans utilize its limited neural resources to accomplish complex regulatory tasks.</p>
<p>2. The conclusions in this study are supported by solid evidence, which are often derived from multiple approaches and/or experiments. Multiple pathogenic bacteria were tested to examine the effect of NPR-15 loss-of-function on immunity; the impacts of pharyngeal pumping and defecation on bacterial accumulation were ruled out when evaluating defense; RNA-seq and qPCR were used to measure gene expression; gene inactivation was done in multiple strains to assess gene function.</p>
<p>3. Gene differential expression, gene ontology and pathway analyses were performed to demonstrate that NPR-15 controls immunity through regulating immune pathways.</p>
<p>4. Elegant approaches were employed to examine avoidance behavior (partial lawn, full lawn, and lawn occupancy) and the involvement of neurons in regulating immunity and avoidance (the use of a diverse array of mutant strains).</p>
<p>5. Statistical analyses were appropriate and adequate.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
The authors are studying the behavioral response to pathogen exposure. They and others have previously describe the role that the G-protein coupled receptors in the nervous system plays in detecting pathogens, and initiating behavioral patterns (e.g. avoidance/learned avoidance) that minimize contact. The authors study this problem in C. elegans, which is amenable to genetic and cellular manipulations and allow the authors to define cellular and signaling mechanisms. This paper extends the original idea to now implicate signaling and transcriptional pathways within a particular neuron (ASJ) and the gut in mediating avoidance behaviour.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
The work is rigorous and elegant and the data are convincing. The authors make superb use of mutant strains in C. elegans, as well tissue specific gene inactivation and expression and genetic methods of cell ablation. to demonstrate how a gene, NPR15 controls behavioral changes in pathogen infection. The results suggest that ASJ neurons and the gut mediate such effects. I expect the paper will constitute an important contribution to our understanding of how the nervous system coordinates immune and behavioral responses to infection.</p>
