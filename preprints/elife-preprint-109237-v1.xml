<abstract><p>The intestine integrates food-derived cues to coordinate organismal physiology, yet the molecular specialization of discrete regions along the intestinal epithelium remains unclear. Here, we generate cell type-specific translatomes of the <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> intestine during fasting and refeeding using discrete promoters for the anterior quartet of intestinal cells (INT1) and the remaining 8 pairs of intestinal cells (INT2-9). We found that the anterior-most INT1 cells are a translationally distinct intestinal sub-compartment that is particularly enriched for immune- and stress-response genes. Functional assays using novel INT1-specific genes emerging from this study reveal that these specialized cells play a previously unappreciated role in pathogen avoidance and organismal survival. A second critical function of INT1 cells is their role in sensing and responding to the contents of the gut lumen. We show that luminal pyruvate is the key signal linking bacterial nutrients in the gut, to secretion of the gut insulin antagonist INS-7. These findings establish INT1 as sentinel enteroendocrine cells that integrate metabolic and immune cues to couple food status with immune and endocrine responses. Our studies also provide a rich resource for dissecting segment-specific intestinal biology, an overlooked and fertile area for future research.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The intestine is a critical organ for food digestion and nutrient absorption in animals. <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, as a bacterivore, constantly ingests a variety of bacteria with an intestinal transit time as short as two minutes in adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>]. This rapid process implies the existence of food-sensing mechanisms within the intestine that can continuously monitor and respond to the acute fluctuation in food availability. When food is absent, a transcriptional metabolic response is evoked via the induction of the fasting response genes including lipases, peroxisomal and mitochondrial β-oxidation genes and some fatty acid desaturases in the intestine to maintain energy homeostasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>]. However, it has been unclear whether discrete segments within the intestine have specific food-sensing capabilities or exhibit different responses to fasting in comparison to the organ as a whole. To our knowledge, no studies to date have addressed this question with high spatial and temporal resolution. The <italic>C. elegans</italic> intestine is comprised of 20 cells designated INT1-INT9 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>]. The anterior ring comprises 4 cells called INT1, which are the most proximal intestinal cells adjacent to the pharynx and represent the initial location of contact with ingested food, which for <italic>C. elegans</italic> is digested bacterial components. The remaining 16 cells are arranged in pairs to form the latter 8 posterior rings (INT2-9) arranged in a stereotypical structure. A number of years ago <italic>Sulston et al.</italic> had observed that the microvilli of INT1 cells are shorter than those in the rest of the intestine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>], which implies that INT1 cells may not have the same food absorption capacity that INT2-9 cells have.</p>
<p>In addition to the morphological differences, we recently reported that INT1 functions as an enteroendocrine cell, and secretes the gut peptide INS-7 shortly after food withdrawal. INS-7 secretion levels increase over the duration of fasting, which are reset by the re-introduction of food. Gut INS-7 acts in the nervous system to suppress the fat loss-stimulating peptide FLP-7, functional ortholog of the <italic>C. elegans</italic> tachykinin peptide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>]. This mechanism allows the stimulation of fat loss to be regulated, in part, by incoming food signals from the gut. Furthermore, <italic>Quintin et al.</italic> showed that worms treated with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> have an induction of the antioxidant enzyme PRDX-2 specifically in INT1 cells, suggesting that INT1 cells may have additional oxidative stress-sensing functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>]. Although these lines of evidence have suggested that INT1 cells may be a group of specialized intestinal cells that sense the quality of the ingested food and have distinct fasting responses, many questions remain. First, the molecular features of INT1 cells and the molecular distinctions between INT1 and the rest of the intestine (INT2-9) have not been defined. Second, the role of INT1 cells in modulating physiological responses to changes in food availability remains undetermined. Finally, the differential effects of metabolic challenge via fasting and re-feeding in the subsets of intestinal cells are unclear.</p>
<p>In this study, we aim to address these questions using spatial translatomics. In short, the approach is as follows: actively translating mRNAs are bound to clusters of ribosomes, referred to as polysomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>]. Translating ribosome affinity purification (TRAP) was developed to isolate cell type-specific polysome-mRNA complexes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>], allowing quantitative analysis of translational regulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>]. Here, we performed TRAP-Seq using a modified protocol based on <italic>McLachlan et al.</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>], in which RPL-22 was tagged with HA to enable affinity purification of polysome-mRNA complexes, which is followed by RNA sequencing. This approach provided a comprehensive spatially distinct translatomic profile of actively translating mRNAs in INT1 and INT2-9 cells. To discern novel temporal features in response to metabolic challenge, we examined the translational responses of these intestinal subsets to acute and chronic fasting and refeeding paradigms. Our datasets reveal that INT1 cells exhibit a distinct molecular identity, characterized by the enrichment of immune- and stress-responsive genes. Furthermore, fasting and refeeding elicit divergent regulatory programs in INT1 and INT2-9 cells. To our knowledge, this represents the first study to determine the molecular identities of discrete intestinal cell subsets in response to fasting and refeeding in <italic>C. elegans</italic>.</p>

<title>Isolation and sequencing of translating RNA from INT1 and INT2-9 cells</title>
<p>To identify the molecular differences between INT1 and INT2-9 cells in fed, fasted and refed states, we employed translating ribosome affinity purification (TRAP) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>] to isolate polysomal RNA from INT1 and INT2-9 cells followed by RNA sequencing. This approach captures actively translating mRNAs, thereby providing a cell type-specific snapshot of the translational landscape under fasting and refeeding conditions. To selectively target INT1 and INT2-9 cells, we expressed the HA-tagged ribosomal protein (RPL-22-3xHA) under the control of the <italic>Pges-1ΔB</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>] and <italic>Ppho-1</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>] promoters, respectively. As published [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>], we noted that <italic>Pges-1ΔB</italic> is strictly expressed in INT1 cells, whereas <italic>Ppho-1</italic> is expressed in INT2-9 cells with detectable, albeit lower expression in INT2 cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>).</p>

<p>We operationally defined the ‘acute’ conditions at 30 min fasting followed by 30 min refeeding, because under these conditions, intestinal fat content remains unchanged (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1C</xref>). However, INS-7 secretion was induced within the 30 min acute fasting period and restored to baseline levels within 30 min upon refeeding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>] , indicating that intestinal responses to food withdrawal can occur before detectable changes in lipid stores. Chronic conditions were established as 3 hr fasting followed by 90 min refeeding. In this paradigm, animals lost approximately half of intestinal lipid stores after chronic fasting, which were subsequently replenished upon refeeding for 90 min (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1D</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1E</xref>). Thus, chronic conditions represent a more pronounced metabolic challenge. For TRAP-Seq sample preparation, we cultured 100,000 <italic>INT1::TRAP</italic> or <italic>INT2-9::TRAP</italic> animals to the Day 1 adult stage, subjected them to acute or chronic conditions (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1F</xref>), and performed RNA isolation following a modified TRAP protocol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>]. These experiments were conducted 3 times.</p>

<title>Stress response genes distinguish INT1 from INT2-9 translatomes across acute and chronic conditions</title>
<p>Principal component analysis (PCA) of all TRAP-Seq datasets revealed clearly distinct clustering by promoter identity, indicating that INT1 and INT2-9 cells maintain fundamentally different molecular identities independent of any and all acute or chronic conditions (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A</xref>). To systematically define these differences, we performed weighted correlation network analysis (WGCNA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>], which unbiasedly identified 12 gene modules associated with condition-specific responses across the INT1 and INT2-9 datasets (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2B</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">S1A Fig</xref>). Notably, the expression of genes in module red was positively correlated to all INT1 conditions but negatively correlated to all INT2-9 conditions, suggesting a transcriptional program preferentially translated in INT1 cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">S1A Fig</xref>). Examination of normalized counts confirmed uniformly higher expression of module red genes across all INT1 conditions compared with INT2-9 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2D</xref>). To identify the categories and functions of module red genes, we used WormCat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>], an annotation and category enrichment tool with near-complete annotation of the <italic>C. elegans</italic> genome. Among the 100 genes from module red, we found genes involved in “Stress Response” including C-type lectin, pathogen and heat categories (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2E</xref>). In addition, Gene Ontology (GO) term enrichment analysis of module red genes further highlighted the enrichment for the terms “Immune system process” and “Response to biotic stimulus” (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">S1B Fig</xref>).</p>

<p>Recently, <italic>Ghaddar et al.</italic> presented a gene expression atlas of adult <italic>C. elegans</italic> with single-cell RNA sequencing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>]. They categorized the intestinal cells into three subtypes: intestine anterior, intestine middle and intestine posterior. To place our findings in the context of previously defined intestinal cell subtypes, we compared our datasets to theirs. Genes annotated as ‘intestine anterior’ were upregulated in INT1 cells, whereas ‘intestine posterior’ genes were downregulated in INT1 relative to INT2-9, supporting our conclusion that INT1 represents a translationally distinct intestinal subset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">S1C-E Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>Next, we decided to comprehensively characterize the translatomic differences between INT1 and INT2-9 cells under each acute and chronic condition. We began with the differentially expressed genes in INT1 cells relative to INT2-9 cells in the fed state. There were 153 upregulated and 58 downregulated genes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2F</xref>), and we found <italic>ins-7</italic> among the upregulated genes, consistent with our prior report of its restricted expression in INT1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>]. To identify the categories of the differentially expressed genes in INT1 cells under the fed condition, we performed WormCat category enrichment analysis and also used ShinyGO [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>] to conduct Gene Ontology (GO) term enrichment analysis with a hierarchical clustering tree, allowing us to visualize the overlapping relationships among enriched GO terms. In the upregulated genes with WormCat analysis, we found genes involved in “Stress Response” including pathogen, C-type lectin, and heat-shock categories (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2G</xref>). Further, the results from ShinyGO demonstrated a cluster of GO terms related to “Immune Response” and “Unfolded Protein Response” (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2H</xref>). In contrast, no functional enrichment was detected among the INT1-downregulated genes. Together, these findings show that INT1 cells are characterized by a stress-and immune-responsive translational program in the fed state, marking a strong and clear distinction from the rest of the intestine.</p>

<sec id="s2c">
<title>C-type lectins and ShKT domain-containing proteins are enriched in INT1 cells</title>
<p>We noticed that many INT1-differentially expressed genes were not assigned to a category by WormCat or annotated by ShinyGO. To further explore their molecular functions, we used the InterPro database to annotate the protein domains for each gene and assign the domains into several main categories, such as “Enzyme”, “Membrane Protein”, and “Transcription Factor”. Genes encoding domains that did not fall into these categories, as well as those lacking identifiable domains, were grouped as “Genes with Unknown Functions” (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">S2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">S2B Fig</xref>). Among the 149 upregulated genes in INT1, we found 11 encoding C-type lectins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">S2A Fig</xref>). C-type-lectin-domain-containing proteins are notable for pathogen recognition and the initiation of immune responses in vertebrates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>]. In <italic>C. elegans,</italic> the expression of many distinct C-type lectins has previously been found to be induced in a pathogen-specific exposure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>].</p>
<p>In addition, we discovered a subset of INT1 upregulated genes encoding ShKT domains within the genes with unknown functions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">S2A Fig</xref>). The ShK toxin (ShKT) is a potassium (K<sup>+</sup>) channel blocker originally isolated from the sea anemone <italic>Stichodactyla helianthus</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>]. ShKT domain-containing proteins have been reported in parasitic nematode secretomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>] and shown to modulate the activity of human effector memory T cells by blocking voltage-gated potassium channels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>]. Their biological functions in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, however, remain unclear. Our findings that specific ShKT domain-containing proteins are specifically expressed in INT1 cells are intriguing. Notably, several INT1-upregulated ShKT proteins, including F01D5.1, F01D5.5 and SYSM-1, were previously found to be upregulated by PMK-1 (p38 MAPK) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>], a key regulator of pathogen-induced immune responses in <italic>C. elegans</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>], suggesting that these ShKT proteins may contribute to intestinal immune functions.</p>
<p>To validate our TRAP-Seq findings and define the spatial expression of INT1-enriched genes, we chose key candidate genes with high fold change and low adjusted p-value (therefore, the most significantly altered genes, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2I</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">S1F-J Fig</xref>) to generate transcriptional reporters using their endogenous promoters and 3’UTRs. We started with <italic>B0024.4</italic>, a membrane raft protein-coding gene with the lowest adjusted p-value in the INT1-enriched genes, which revealed tight expression restricted to INT1 cells. We next decided to examine reporters for two C-type lectin genes, <italic>clec-86</italic> and <italic>clec-160</italic>, and two ShKT protein-coding genes, <italic>F01D5.1</italic> and <italic>F01D5.5.</italic> Reporters for <italic>clec-86, clec-160 and F01D5.5</italic> also exhibited highly specific expression in INT1, whereas <italic>F01D5.1</italic> was expressed in both INT1 and INT2. Out of curiosity, we also generated a reporter line for the most highly downregulated gene <italic>npr-28</italic> in INT1, and interestingly, found that it was restricted to the posterior intestinal cells INT7-9, with no expression in the anterior intestine (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2J</xref>). Collectively, these analyses corroborate the spatial restriction of our TRAP-Seq method and demonstrate that INT1-upregulated and INT1-downregulated genes exhibit distinct spatial expression patterns along the intestine.</p>

<title>Comparisons of enriched categories under acute and chronic conditions identify ShKT domain-containing proteins as stable INT1-specific markers</title>
<p>We next wished to evaluate whether there are specific differences between INT1 and INT2-9 cells under acute fasting and refeeding. In the acute fasted state, INT1 displayed 90 upregulated and 12 downregulated genes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3A</xref>). WormCat analysis of upregulated genes revealed those involved in “Stress Response” including C-type lectin and pathogen categories (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3B</xref>), while ShinyGO identified a cluster of GO terms related to “Defense Response” (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3C</xref>). In the acute refed state, we observed 52 INT1-upregulated and 35 INT1-downregulated genes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3D</xref>). Enriched categories of the upregulated genes again included “Stress Response”, particularly pathogen and C-type lectins by WormCat (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3E</xref>), with GO terms related to “Defense Response” and “Immune Response” by ShinyGO (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3F</xref>). InterPro annotations of INT1-upregulated genes revealed consistent representation of “Enzyme”, “C-type Lectin” and “Membrane Protein” categories across fed, acute fasted, and acute refed states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">S3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">S3C Fig</xref>). Although enriched functional categories were similar between the 2 intestinal sub-compartments, a Venn diagram analysis of the “Stress Response” genes demonstrated only partial overlap across states (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>), suggesting that translational differences between INT1 and INT2-9 vary depending on physiological states.</p>

<p>To further test this possibility, we compared gene lists from 4 major InterPro categories (“Enzyme”, “Membrane Protein”, “C-type Lectin” and “ShKT Protein”) across fed, acute fasted and acute refed states (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4B-H</xref>). While “Enzyme”, “Membrane Protein”, and “C-type Lectin” categories exhibited only partial overlap, the “ShKT Protein” category showed near-complete overlap across conditions (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4E</xref>), suggesting that ShKT proteins represent stable INT1-specific markers under acute conditions.</p>
<p>We next extended our analysis to chronic fasting and refeeding, which elicit more pronounced metabolic shifts in the intestine. In the chronic fasted state, INT1 exhibited 111 upregulated and 77 downregulated genes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3G</xref>). WormCat analysis of the upregulated genes again identified enrichment for “Stress Response” categories, including C-type lectins and pathogen-related genes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3H</xref>), while ShinyGO revealed a cluster of GO terms related to “Immune Response” (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3I</xref>). Similar enrichments were observed in the chronic refed state (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3K</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3L</xref>). InterPro annotations of INT1 upregulated genes revealed categories consistent with acute conditions, including “Enzyme”, “Membrane Protein” and “C-type Lectin” (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4">S4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4">S4C Fig</xref>). Comparison of gene lists demonstrated partial overlap within these categories (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4J-L, 4N-P</xref>). Strikingly, however, upregulated ShKT genes showed near-complete overlap across chronic conditions (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4M</xref>).</p>
<p>Finally, we compared the INT1-upregulated ShKT genes across both acute and chronic conditions. Venn diagram analysis revealed complete overlap, with the same set of 11 ShKT genes consistently upregulated in all conditions (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4R</xref>). These findings demonstrate that ShKT domain-containing proteins represent robust INT1-specific markers, stable across both acute and chronic states. Thus, pathogen-sensing, detoxification and mounting an organismal response to incoming information from the gut lumen are the principal functions of INT1.</p>

<title>INT1 and INT2-9 cells exhibit distinct fasting and refeeding responses under acute and chronic conditions</title>
<p>Given the fundamentally distinct translatomes of the INT1 and INT2-9 cells, we next investigated whether these differences extend to their responses to fasting and refeeding. Specifically, we sought to determine if the translatomic profiles of INT1 and INT2-9 cells exhibit distinct regulatory patterns in response to metabolic shifts induced by fasting and subsequent refeeding. Looking at the concordance of differentially expressed genes during chronic and acute fasting between INT1 and INT2-9 cells, we identified fasting-response genes with opposing regulation between the two intestinal subsets (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5A</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5B</xref>). For instance, 270 genes were upregulated in INT1 following acute fasting but downregulated in INT2-9 under the same condition (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5A</xref>), indicating divergent translational responses to metabolic shifts.</p>

<p>We next listed all differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in INT1 and INT2-9 under acute and chronic conditions. Overall, INT1 exhibited fewer DEGs than INT2-9 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5C</xref>). To rule out the possibility that INT1 DEGs represented a subset of INT2-9 DEGs, we used Venn diagrams to compare all the INT1 and INT2-9 DEGs from both acute and chronic conditions (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5D</xref>). We found two major features of these fasting and refeeding response genes. Notably, INT1 DEGs were not a subset of INT2-9 DEGs regardless of acute or chronic conditions, but rather represented distinct gene sets (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5D</xref>). Another key distinction is that for both INT1 and INT2-9, the acute response genes did not overlap substantially with chronic response genes, indicating that distinct translational programs are engaged during acute versus chronic conditions (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5D</xref>).</p>
<p>To identify the enriched categories of these INT1 and INT2-9 DEGs under each condition, we performed WormCat analysis and found that INT1 datasets generally had fewer enriched categories than INT2-9 datasets under each condition. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs5">S5A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs5">S5B Fig</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs6">S6A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs6">S6B Fig</xref>). In the acute fasted state, upregulated genes in both INT1 and INT2-9 were enriched for “Metabolism”, whereas categories including “Stress Response”, “Transcription Factor”, and “Lysosome” were specific to INT2-9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs5">S5A Fig</xref>). Among the downregulated genes in both cell types in the acute fasted state, we found genes involved in “Ribosome”, including ribosomal subunit genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs5">S5B Fig</xref>). Interestingly, in the acute refed state, genes involved in “Ribosome” were upregulated in INT2-9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs5">S5C Fig</xref>), suggesting the sensitivity of ribosomal gene expression to acute fasting and refeeding. Additional categories, such as “Transcription Factor” and “Proteolysis Proteasome”, were enriched exclusively among INT2-9 downregulated genes in the acute refed state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs5">S5D Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>Further, we observed that chronic conditions elicited broader and more diverse enrichment patterns than acute states in both INT1 and INT2-9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs5">S5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs6">S6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs7">S7 Figs</xref>). Although this is an expected result, the category term “Stress Response” was surprisingly enriched only among INT1-upregulated genes in the chronic fasted state (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5E</xref>), whereas “Pathogen” was uniquely enriched among INT1-upregulated genes in the chronic refed state (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5F</xref>), underscoring an important potential specialization of INT1 in stress and immune responses.</p>
<p>Conversely, both INT1 and INT2-9 datasets shared enrichment for “Ribosome” and “Metabolism” among downregulated genes in the chronic fasted state and upregulated genes in the chronic refed state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs6">S6B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs7">S7A Figs</xref>), suggesting that protein translation and metabolic regulation are highly responsive to chronic fasting and refeeding.</p>
<p>Taken together, these results demonstrate that INT1 and INT2-9 cells engage distinct translational programs during fasting and refeeding. The divergence is particularly evident under chronic conditions, where INT1 uniquely activates stress- and pathogen-related programs, suggesting specialized roles for INT1 in maintaining homeostasis under chronic conditions. However, because a large portion of the INT1 DEGs remain unassigned by WormCat, the full extent of INT1-specific regulatory programs may not be fully captured by gene set enrichment analyses.</p>

<title>INT1 cells modulate pathogen avoidance, survival, and peptide secretion</title>
<p>To begin to annotate and assign functions to the genes emerging from our datasets, we examined the pathogen response and peptide secretion functions of the INT1 cells, and the roles of the most highly regulated genes therein. To study pathogen response, we noted that previous studies had implicated INT1-enriched genes in immune responses. For example, expression of <italic>B0024.4</italic> is induced upon exposure to pathogenic <italic>S. maltophilia</italic> JV3 strain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>], and <italic>clec-42,</italic> one of our INT1-upregulated genes, is exclusively expressed in INT1 at all larval stages and mediates resistance to pathogen Bt247 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>]. To test whether INT1-upregulated genes contribute to immune responses, we performed the PA14 avoidance- and PA14 slow-killing assays [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>] following INT1-specific RNAi knockdown of <italic>clec-86</italic> and <italic>clec-160</italic> RNAi. Interestingly, animals with INT1-specific knockdown of either gene exhibited impaired PA14 avoidance (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6A</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6B</xref>) and significantly increased survival on PA14 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6C</xref>). These findings suggest that INT1 cells execute specialized, gene-dependent immune functions during pathogen exposure.</p>

<p>From the WGCNA, we noted that some modules (brown, magenta, turquoise) contained genes with an undulating change in expression levels in response to fasting and refeeding under both acute and chronic conditions (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6D-F</xref>). These genes could be classified as “fasted up/refed down” or “fasted down/refed up”. WormCat analysis of brown module genes identified enrichment for “Ribosome” and “Metabolism”, consistent with categories previously linked to ribosomal subunit genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs6">S6B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs7">S7A</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs8">S8A Figs</xref>). Notably, modules magenta and turquoise contained “fasted up/refed down” genes, but the induction in INT2-9 cells after acute fasting was weaker in the turquoise module, suggesting these undulating genes were more INT1-specific (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6E</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6F</xref>).</p>
<p>Given our prior finding that the gut peptide INS-7 is secreted from INT1 cells in response to acute fasting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>], we next investigated whether INT1-specific undulating genes could modulate this response. Using a strain enabling INT1-specific RNAi (<italic>sid-1;Pges-1ΔB::sid-1</italic>) crossed into an INS-7 secretion reporter, we confirmed that vector RNAi-treated animals displayed the expected undulating INS-7 secretion levels upon acute fasting and refeeding (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6G</xref>), as previously described REF. We next targeted two INT1-specific undulating genes, <italic>aakg-4</italic> and <italic>fmo-2</italic>, which showed the largest absolute fold changes across acute fasting and refeeding for INT1-specific RNAi (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6H</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6J</xref>). <italic>aakg-4</italic> is the gene encoding one of the five γ subunits of the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) in <italic>C. elegans</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>]. However, the physiological role of <italic>aakg-4</italic> in the intestine is unknown. Remarkably, INT1-specific <italic>aakg-4</italic> knockdown prevented INS-7 secretion from returning to basal levels after refeeding, indicating a requirement for <italic>aakg-4</italic> in resetting INS-7 secretion and suggesting that INS-7 release from INT1 cells is subject to energy-dependent regulation, consistent with its modulation by fasting and refeeding (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6I</xref>). The second gene <italic>fmo-2</italic>, encoding flavin-containing monooxygenase-2, is known to promote longevity under hypoxia and dietary restriction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>]. FMOs contain the prosthetic group that binds FAD<sup>+</sup> and utilize the cofactor NADPH together with O<sub>2</sub> to catalyze substrate oxygenation, generating NADP<sup>+</sup> as a by-product [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>]. Animals subjected to INT1-specific <italic>fmo-2</italic> knockdown displayed a normal fasting-induced INS-7 secretion, but exhibited reduced basal INS-7 secretion and impaired refeeding response (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6K</xref>). Given that NADPH/NADP<sup>+</sup> ratio is a central determinant of cellular redox state and energy metabolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>], this result further supports the notion that regulation of INS-7 secretion in INT1 cells is coupled to energy-sensing metabolic pathways.</p>
<p>Together, these results demonstrate that INT1 cells integrate immune and metabolic cues. By regulating pathogen avoidance and survival through lectin genes and modulating INS-7 secretion via energy-responsive genes such as <italic>aakg-4</italic> and <italic>fmo-2,</italic> INT1 cells function as a specialized intestinal subset that senses energy states and coordinates gut peptide secretion to maintain organismal homeostasis.</p>

<title>Pyruvate is crucial for regulating INS-7 peptide secretion from INT1 cells</title>
<p>We were intrigued by the findings with <italic>aakg-4</italic> and <italic>fmo-2</italic>, which suggested that cellular energy status may govern the refeeding response of INS-7 secretion. Notably, the effect does not appear to be mediated by changes in intestinal fat content, as lipid levels remain unaltered during acute fasting and refeeding (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1C</xref>). These observations led us to hypothesize that INT1 cells may integrate specific sensory cues to reset INS-7 secretion in response to food availability. To explore this possibility, we first evaluated the contribution of mechanosensory inputs. Fasted worms refed with 0.5 μm latex beads, comparable in size to <italic>E. coli</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>], failed to restore INS-7 secretion to basal levels, whereas refeeding with OP50 fully normalized INS-7 secretion (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig 7A</xref>), suggesting that mechano-stimulus alone was not sufficient to induce the refeeding response of INS-7 secretion. Because <italic>C. elegans</italic> can detect secreted molecules from bacteria and trigger a stress response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>], we next exposed fasted animals to cell-free OP50 culture supernatant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>]. Supernatant alone likewise failed to reset INS-7 secretion (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig 7A</xref>). A combination of beads and supernatant was similarly ineffective (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig 7A</xref>). In contrast, UV-killed OP50 completely reinstated basal INS-7 secretion (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig 7A</xref>), indicating that chemicals or nutrients from bacteria, rather than mechano-stimulus or secreted molecules, mediate the refeeding response.</p>

</fig>
<p>Next, we set out to pinpoint the bacterial nutrient or chemical most critical for regulating INS-7 secretion during refeeding. Based on the requirement of <italic>aakg-4</italic> and <italic>fmo-2</italic> for INS-7 secretion dynamics, we tested whether restoring cellular energy states after fasting could return INS-7 secretion to baseline. Glucose serves as a primary cellular energy source, undergoing glycolysis to generate pyruvate, which in turn fuels downstream metabolic pathways to produce energy. However, refeeding fasted worms with 2% glucose, a concentration considered a high-glucose diet for <italic>C. elegans</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>], failed to normalize INS-7 secretion, which remained elevated (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig 7B</xref>). In contrast, remarkably, refeeding with 100 mM pyruvate, a dose effective in prior studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>], fully recapitulated the refeeding response observed with OP50 (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig 7B</xref>). This effect was dose-dependent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs9">S9A Fig</xref>). Thus, pyruvate, a key molecule derived from glycolysis and a precursor metabolite for numerous biochemical processes, is sufficient to substitute for bacterial food in restoring INS-7 secretion to baseline after fasting.</p>
<p>After entering the cell, pyruvate can be converted to lactate or alanine in the cytosol or transported into the mitochondrial matrix via the mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>] to enter the citric acid cycle, which generates energy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>]. INT1-specific RNAi of the two <italic>C. elegans</italic> MPC genes (<italic>mpc-1</italic> and <italic>mpc-2</italic>) abolished the pyruvate-induced restoration of INS-7 secretion (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig 7C</xref> and <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7D</xref>), demonstrating that mitochondrial import of pyruvate is required. Within the matrix, pyruvate is converted to acetyl-CoA by pyruvate dehydrogenase (<italic>pdha-1</italic> and <italic>pdhb-1</italic> in <italic>C. elegans</italic>) or to oxaloacetate by pyruvate carboxylase (<italic>pyc-1</italic> in <italic>C. elegans</italic>). INT1-specific knockdown of either pathway suppressed fasting-induced INS-7 secretion and abolished secretion dynamics (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig 7E</xref> and <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7F</xref>). Since chronic <italic>pdha-1</italic> and <italic>pdhb-1</italic> knockdown lowered basal INS-7 secretion level, we acutely inhibited pyruvate dehydrogenase during refeeding with the specific inhibitor 3-fluropyruvate (3-FP); this intervention prevented normalization of INS-7 secretion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs9">S9B Fig</xref>), suggesting that the conversion of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA is required for the refeeding response of INS-7 secretion.</p>
<p>If intracellular pyruvate is the crucial determinant of INS-7 secretion, we predicted that maintaining pyruvate levels in the INT1 cells during fasting should suppress the fasting-induced INS-7 secretion. Indeed, worms fasted on NGM agar supplemented with 100 mM pyruvate showed no induction of INS-7 secretion (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig 7G</xref>), suggesting pyruvate alone is sufficient to suppress fasting-induced INS-7 secretion. Collectively, these findings identify mitochondrial pyruvate metabolism as the key signal sensed by INT1 enteroendocrine cells to couple nutritional availability with the fluctuation in INS-7 peptide secretion during fasting and refeeding.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In the human intestine, both epithelial and immune cell compositions shift dramatically along the anterior-posterior axis, with region-specific cellular neighborhoods for epithelial, stromal, and immune cells contributing to distinct physiological functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>]. In contrast, the <italic>C. elegans</italic> intestine comprises only 20 epithelial cells and lacks resident immune cells, raising the question of whether spatially defined molecular and functional heterogeneity also exists in this simplified but powerful model system. Our findings, together with prior observations, support the view that <italic>C. elegans</italic> intestinal subsets are molecularly and functionally distinct.</p>
<p>In the present study, we utilized INT1-and INT2-9-specific promoters to perform TRAP-Seq analyses under fasting and refeeding conditions. While comparisons between INT1 and INT2-9 cells revealed marked differences, this approach likely underrepresents heterogeneity among the INT2-9 cells themselves. Prior studies demonstrated that posterior intestinal cells initiate the rhythmic defecation motor program [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>], and our dataset identified <italic>npr-28</italic>, which is specifically expressed in the posterior intestinal cells INT7-9 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2J</xref>), further underscoring molecular diversity across intestinal segments. Future identification of promoters with more restricted expression within the INT2-9 subset will be crucial for functionally resolving the spatial map of the <italic>C. elegans</italic> intestine.</p>
<p>We previously identified INT1 as enteroendocrine cells that secrete the gut peptide INS-7 preferentially during acute food withdrawal to suppress neuronally stimulated fat loss [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>]. Additional lines of evidence also point to the specialization of the anterior-most INT1 cells. First, acid phosphatase staining for intestinal brush border could not be detected in INT1 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>]. Second, Methyl red staining showed strong red staining of acidic vacuoles in INT1 cells. From INT2 to INT9 cells, vacuoles were stained gradually from orange-yellow (neutral-alkaline) to yellow (alkaline) with methyl red [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>], suggesting the pH of intracellular vacuoles is lower in INT1 cells. Third, ultrastructural analysis highlighted enrichment of rough ER, Golgi, and mitochondria in INT1, consistent with a secretory function, whereas INT2-9 cells preferentially accumulate yolk and lipid vacuoles for storage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>]. Fourth, components of a cullin-RING ubiquitin ligase complex critical for thermotolerance and the intracellular pathogen response (IPR), including CUL-6 and SKR-5, were found to be specifically expressed in INT1 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>], suggesting that INT1 cells may play an integral role in proteostasis responses to intracellular pathogen infection. Collectively, these findings establish INT1 as a specialized cell-type that integrates endocrine, stress, and immune functions within the <italic>C. elegans</italic> intestine.</p>
<p>We uncovered pyruvate as a crucial metabolite that functions as a true surrogate for bacterial food to regulate the secretion of the endogenous insulin antagonist INS-7 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>]. Pyruvate must enter the TCA cycle to elicit this effect, suggesting that either actual metabolism of pyruvate is required, or that downstream metabolites may also act as mediators of this process. In other systems, TCA cycle intermediates such as acetyl-CoA, itaconate, and L-2-hydroxyglutarate (L-2-HG) modulate immune responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>], while succinate and fumarate regulate hypoxia sensing upon cytosolic release [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>]. A similar mechanism may underpin the communication between mitochondria and the nucleus in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, exemplified by the translocation of ATFS-1 during the activation of the mitochondrial unfolded protein response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>]. Thus, pyruvate metabolism may provide a metabolic checkpoint that couples nutrient availability to enteroendocrine signaling.</p>
<p>Many bacterial species including <italic>Y. enterocolitica</italic>, <italic>C. freundii</italic>, <italic>E. aerogenes</italic> and <italic>E. coli</italic> excrete pyruvate into the extracellular environment during nutrient-replete conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>] and reabsorb extracellular pyruvate during nutrient insufficiency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>]. Thus, the presence of extracellular pyruvate may serve as an indicator of the nutrient abundance in bacterial environments, a sensing mechanism that <italic>C. elegans</italic> may have co-evolved by leveraging the INT1 cells to couple environmental conditions with host physiology. It was reported that <italic>C. elegans</italic> exhibits chemotaxis to volatile pyruvic acid via AWC neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>]. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying both INT1 and neuronal sensing of pyruvate remain uncharacterized. Thus both intracellular and extracellular bacterial pyruvate appear to regulate the metabolism or behavior of <italic>C. elegans</italic>, indicating that pyruvate is a crucial signaling molecule.</p>
<p>In summary, we expect our TRAP-Seq datasets presented here to provide the scientific community with valuable resources for investigating the dynamic translatomes of specific subsets of intestinal cells in response to fasting and refeeding. More broadly, the discovery of cell-type heterogeneity within the <italic>C. elegans</italic> intestine highlights the evolutionary conservation of spatially organized intestinal biology and lays a foundation for future mechanistic studies of metabolic and immune regulation in the intestine.</p>

<title>Limitations of the TRAP-Seq in the current study</title>
<p>Not all previous studies have demonstrated a strong correlation between mRNA expression levels and protein abundance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>]. TRAP-Seq provides a more precise assessment of gene expression by detecting actively translating mRNAs. Specifically, TRAP-Seq better reflects the translational responses under various conditions, such as temperature fluctuations or fasting. Moreover, by employing tagged ribosomal proteins, TRAP-Seq enables the selective purification of polysomes without the need for cell dissociation or sorting, thereby reducing RNA contamination from neighboring cells or tissues.</p>
<p>To obtain sufficient ribosome-mRNA complexes for RNA sequencing, we generated strains with an integrated extrachromosomal array expressing HA-tagged RPL22 in either INT1 or INT2-9 cells. While this strategy enables robust affinity purification, the elevated expression of HA-tagged RPL22 in this system could potentially introduce unanticipated effects on transcript utilization or translational bias. Nevertheless, because all analyses rely on internal referencing, the differential gene expression signatures remain valid. In addition, the random integration of multi-copy transgenes into unknown genomic loci may alter the expression of adjacent genes, leading to additional variability. Importantly, we did not observe any changes in growth rate, fertility or fecundity in the TRAP-seq transgenic lines, suggesting that potential confounding effects are minimal.</p>
<p>TRAP has traditionally tagged proteins of the 60S large ribosomal subunit, including RPL10A [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref>] and RPL22 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref>], to enable tissue-or cell type-specific capture of polysome-mRNA complexes followed by RNA sequencing. A key distinction among previous studies lies in the choice of ribosomal protein for tagging. Both RPL10A and RPL22 are evolutionarily conserved ribosomal proteins. In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, RPL10A [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref>] and RPL22 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref>] have been successfully used for tagging in TRAP-Seq experiments, yielding robust results. However, recent findings in mammalian systems indicate that RPL10A is significantly sub-stoichiometric in polysomes of mouse embryonic stem cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref>], suggesting it is not associated with all actively translating mRNAs. Similarly, in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, RPL10A shows limited expression in the germline and weak association with ribosomes, impairing the co-purification of translating mRNAs from the germline [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref>]. These observations suggest that tagging RPL10A in TRAP experiments may not capture the complete translatome in specific cell types or tissues.</p>
<p>Further, <italic>Nousch et al.</italic> recently demonstrated that RPL-4 and RPL-9 are more effective than RPL10A and RPL22 for purifying polysome-mRNA complexes from germ cells in <italic>C. elegans</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref>], suggesting that the choice of ribosomal proteins for tagging in TRAP-Seq experiments may vary depending on the tissue of interest. Specifically, certain ribosomal proteins may offer improved specificity and efficiency for isolating tissue-specific mRNAs. Importantly, the RPL22-based TRAP in our experiments achieved robust immunoprecipitation efficiency (about 40% of input) for intestinal polysomal mRNAs (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbls1">S4 table</xref>), thereby validating our approach. Future studies may further investigate whether alternative ribosomal proteins could provide enhanced isolation of translating mRNAs in different tissues including the intestine.</p>

<p>Summary</p>
<p>In this study, the authors have performed tissue-specific ribosome pulldown to identify gene expression (translatome) differences in the anterior vs posterior cells of the C. elegans intestine. They have performed this analysis in fed and fasted states of the animal. The data generated will be very useful to the C. elegans community, and the role of pyruvate shown in this study will result in interesting follow-up investigations.</p>
<p>However, several strong claims made in the study are solely based on in silico predictions and are not supported by experimental evidence.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Several studies in the past have predicted different functions of the anterior (INT1) vs posterior (INT2-9) epithelial cells of the C. elegans intestine based on their anatomy and ultrastructure, but detailed characterization of differences in gene expression between these cell types (and whether indeed these are different 'cell types') was lacking prior to this study. The genes and drivers identified to be exclusively expressed in the anterior vs posterior segments of the intestine will be very helpful to selectively modulate different parts of the C. elegans intestine in future studies.</p>
<p>Another strength of this study is the careful experimental design to test how the anterior vs posterior cell types of the intestine respond differently to food deprivation and recovery after return to food. These comparisons between 'states' of a cell in different physiological conditions are difficult to pick up in single-cell analyses due to low sequencing depth, which can fail to identify subtle modulation of gene expression.</p>
<p>The TRAP-associated bulk RNA-seq approach used in this study is more suitable for such comparisons and provides additional information on post-transcriptional regulation during metabolic stress.</p>
<p>A key finding of this study is that pyruvate levels modulate the translation state of anterior intestinal cells during fasting. Characterization of pyruvate metabolism genes, especially of the enzymes involved in its mitochondrial breakdown, provides novel insights into how gut epithelial cells respond to the acute absence of food.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Unlike previous TRAP-seq studies (PMID: 30580965, 36044259, 36977417) that reported sequencing data for both input and IP samples, this study only reports the sequencing data for IP samples. Since biochemical pulldowns are variable across replicates, it is difficult to know if the observed differences between different conditions are due to biological factors or differences in IP efficiency. More importantly, since two different TRAP lines were utilized in this study and a large proportion of the results focus on the differences between the translational profiles of INT1 vs INT2-9 cells, it is essential to know if the IP worked with similar efficiency for both TRAP strains that likely have different expression levels of the HA-tagged ribosomal protein. One way to estimate this would be to perform qRT-PCR of genes that are known to be enriched in all intestinal cells and determine whether their fold-enrichment over housekeeping genes (normalized to input) is similar in INT1 vs INT2-9 TRAP strains and across the fed vs fasted conditions. The authors, in fact, mention variability across biological replicates, due to which certain replicates were excluded from their WGCNA analysis.</p>
<p>It appears that GFP expression is also detectable in INT2 (in addition to strong expression in INT1 in Fig.1A). Compared to INT3-9, which looks red, INT2 cells appear yellow, suggesting that the expression patterns of the two TRAP drivers are not mutually exclusive, which changes the interpretation of many of the results described in the study.</p>
<p>Some parts of the study overemphasize the differences between the INT1 vs INT2-9 cell types, which is a biased representation of the results. For example, the authors specifically point out that 270 genes are differentially expressed in opposite directions in INT1 vs INT2-9 cell types during acute (30 min) fasting without mentioning the 1,268 genes that are differentially expressed in the same direction. They also do not mention here that 96% of the genes are differentially expressed in the same direction in INT1 and INT2-9 cell types after prolonged (180 min) fasting, suggesting that the divergent translational responses of these cell types are only observed in the first 30 minutes of food deprivation. Similar results have also been reported for the effect of fasting on locomotory and feeding behaviors, where 30 min of fasting produces more variable effects, which become more consistent after longer periods of fasting (PMID: 36083280). Hence, the effects of brief food deprivation should be interpreted with caution.</p>
<p>Many of the interpretations of this study primarily rely on pathway enrichment analyses, which are based on the known function of genes. The function of uncharacterized genes that were found to be differentially expressed in INT1 vs INT2-9 cell types, e.g., the ShKT proteins, was not explored in this study. In addition, overreliance on pathway enrichment tools (instead of functional validation) has resulted in several conflicting findings. For example, one of the main messages of this study is that INT1 cells specialize in immune and stress response in response to fasting, which relies on pathway analysis in Figs 5E and 5F. However, pathway analysis at a different time point (shown in Figure S5A) indicates that INT2-9 cells show a much stronger increase in translation of stress and pathogen-responsive genes compared to INT1 cells. Hence, some of the results should be interpreted as different translational effects in INT1 vs INT2-9 cells after different lengths of food deprivation, without making broad claims about selective pathways being affected only in specific cell types.</p>
<p>The authors have compared their TRAP-seq results with genes enriched in the anterior and posterior intestine clusters from a previously published whole-animal adult scRNA dataset (PMID: 37352352). They claim that their TRAP-seq results are in agreement with the findings of the scRNA study. However, among the 10 genes from the 'posterior intestine' scRNA cluster in Fig.S1E, six are downregulated in the INT1 vs INT2-9 comparison, while four are upregulated. Hence, there is no clear agreement between the two studies in terms of the top enriched genes in the anterior vs posterior intestine, which should be considered for cross-study comparisons in the future.</p>
<p>The authors describe in the manuscript that they have performed INT1-specific RNAi for two C-type lectin genes that are upregulated during fasting. Due to a recent expansion of C-type lectin genes in C. elegans, there is a high chance of off-target effects of RNAi that is designed for members of this gene family. More trustworthy results could have been obtained using CRISPR-based loss-of-function alleles for these genes, one of which is publicly available. Also, the authors do not provide any explanation for why knockdown of these stress-response genes, which are activated in INT1 cells in response to food deprivation, results in improved resistance to pathogens. This, in fact, suggests a role of INT1 cells in increasing pathogen susceptibility, and not pathogen resistance, during food deprivation.</p>
<p>Many of the studies in this field (e.g., references 2-4 in this article) have investigated the effects of food deprivation ranging from 4 hr to 24 hr, which results in activation of starvation responses in C. elegans. In contrast, the authors have used shorter time periods of fasting (30 min and 180 min), and most of their follow-up experiments have used 30 min of food deprivation. Previous work has shown that the effects of food deprivation can either accumulate over time (i.e., the effect gets stronger with longer food deprivation) or can be transient (i.e., only observed briefly after removal of food and not observed during long-term food deprivation). Starvation-induced transcription factors such as DAF-16/FoxO and HLH-30 show strong translocation to the nucleus only after 30 min of fasting. Though gene expression changes in all stages of food deprivation are of biological relevance, the authors have missed the opportunity to explore whether increased INS-7 secretion from the anterior intestine is dependent on these starvation-induced transcription factors (which can be easily tested using loss-of-function alleles) or is due to other fast-acting regulatory mechanisms induced due to the absence of food contents in the gut lumen. A previous study (PMID: 40991693) has shown that DAF-16 activation during prolonged starvation shuts down insulin peptide secretion from the intestinal epithelial cells. Hence, it is not clear if increased INS-7 secretion is only a feature of short-term food deprivation or is also a signature of long-term starvation (e.g., at 8 hr or 16 hr timepoints). Since most of the INS-7 secretion data in this study are for 30 min of fasting, it remains unknown whether the discovered regulators of INS-7 secretion can be generalized for extended food deprivation that triggers major metabolic changes, such as fat loss (e.g., conditions shown in Figure 1D).</p>
<p>Two previous studies (PMID: 18025456, 40991693) have shown a strong reduction in the expression of ins-7 in the anterior intestine using GFP-based reporters (both promoter fusions and endogenous CRISPR-generated) and in whole-animal RNA-seq data from starved animals. These results are in contrast to the increased INS-7 secretion from INT1 cells during fasting that is reported in this study. The authors here have reported that INS-7 translation is higher in INT1 compared to INT2-9 during fed, acute fasted, and chronic fasted conditions, but they have not shown whether INS-7 translation is upregulated during acute and chronic fasting in INT1 cells in their TRAP-seq analysis. Knowing whether increased INS-7 secretion during acute fasting is due to increased transcription, translation, or secretion of INS-7 is crucial to resolve the discrepancy between these studies.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this study, the authors set out to understand whether the discrete segments of the C.elegans intestine were specialized to carry out distinct functions during an animal's exposure and adaptation to a fast-changing nutrient environment. To achieve this, the authors used a method called Translating ribosome affinity purification (TRAP), which provides a snapshot of what genes are being translated into proteins (and therefore functionally prioritized by the animal) under different fasting and re-feeding conditions. By expressing the TRAP constructs in two distinct segments of the intestine (INT1) and (INT2-9), the authors were able to identify how these segments responded to changing nutrient availability.</p>
<p>Already under steady state nutrient conditions, the authors found that INT1 and INT2-9 appeared to have different 'tasks', with INT1 expressing more immune- and stress-response related genes. Exposing animals to different regimens of starvation and refeeding also showed marked differences between the intestinal segments, and the gene expression patterns in INT1 were consistent with INT1 cells playing an integrative role in linking nutrient cues to the secretion of insulin molecules that regulate fat metabolism with food intake. In summary, the data presented catalogue, for the first time, gene expression differences between two areas of the intestine, suspected to play different roles, and through clever experiments, links these gene expression changes to responses to nutrient availability.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The data presented catalogue - for the first time and in a careful manner - gene expression differences between two areas of the intestine. They strongly support the presence of intriguing differences between two areas of the intestine in immune, metabolic, and stress-response regulation, and link these gene expression changes to the responses of these regions to nutrient availability.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The conclusions of this paper are mostly well-supported by data, but the relevance of the changing gene expression patterns could be better clarified and extended in the discussion.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this study, Liu and colleagues utilize TRAP-seq to profile the repertoire of actively translated mRNAs in different intestinal cell types (anterior INT1 vs. posterior INT2-9 cells) in C. elegans. A key goal of this study was to identify transcripts differentially expressed/translated between these intestinal cell subtypes in the context of animals being well fed or subjected to acute (30 minutes) or chronic (3 hours) starvation, followed by refeeding.</p>
<p>The authors identify a number of differentially expressed genes across all of the conditions tested. They then provide an initial survey of the landscape of translatome changes through Weighted Gene Network Correlation Analysis (WGNA), and some high-level functional surveys via Gene Ontology (GO) term analysis and protein domain analysis. The authors validate the enriched expression patterns of some of their identified candidate genes using fluorescent promoter fusion reporters, confirming INT1-specific expression. The authors further implicate the role of several other candidate genes in pathogen avoidance and in response to nutritional cues by knocking them down specifically in INT1 cells by RNAi. Finally, the authors identify pyruvate as a major nutrient signal coming from the bacterial diet that suppresses the release of a key insulin peptide (INS-7), and identify some of the genes expressed in INT1 that are required for this response.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) Good use of and justification for TRAP-seq, because scRNA-seq would be difficult under the varied conditions used (starvation, refeeding).</p>
<p>(2) The manuscript is generally clear to read, and the data are generally well-presented with good supporting data that includes replicates, sample sizes, error measurements, and associated statistics.</p>
<p>(3) The dataset will be an interesting resource to mine for future studies focusing on mechanisms of how particular intestinal cell types respond to different environmental signals.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) A limitation of TRAP-seq, although powerful, is that only relative comparisons can be made between genotypes/conditions to identify differentially-expressed genes, rather than assessing whether a given gene is expressed at a certain level in a cell type under a certain condition. This limitation is due to the non-specific association of sticky RNA species with the beads during the immunoprecipitation step. This is a minor point, however, and the authors do a nice job of focusing their analysis on differentially expressed transcripts in the current study.</p>
<p>(2) Another limitation of the current study is that the experiments testing the role of candidate genes identified by their profiling experiments do not delve a bit deeper into providing a mechanistic understanding of the phenotypes being studied. At present, the results are thus viewed more as a genomics-based screen with some limited follow-up on interesting hits. However, this reviewer appreciates that when placed in the context of the work presented, a presentation of the profiling data along with some validation is an excellent starting point for future mechanistic studies elaborating on these interesting candidates.</p>
<p>Appraisal of whether the authors achieved their aims, and whether the results support their conclusions:</p>
<p>The main goal of the study was to survey the dynamic responses at the level of actively translated mRNAs of the INT1 vs INT2-9 cells in response to metabolic challenge.</p>
<p>Overall, the authors use established methods to perform their genome-wide analysis, and the set of differentially regulated genes is enriched for expected molecular functions and forms coherent networks in anticipated pathways.</p>
<p>The validation experiments (promoter::GFP fusion reporters, INT1-specific knockdowns of highly regulated genes) further corroborate the quality of the TRAP-seq datasets generated.</p>
<p>I have a few points for the authors that would further strengthen this work:</p>
<p>(1) The authors rightfully focus on the top differentially-regulated candidates, but it's unclear at present how far down their fold change list would lead to expression pattern validations. It would be useful to test a few more promoter::GFP fusion reporters at different enrichment/fold-change/statistical cutoffs.</p>
<p>(2) Although the INT1-specific RNAi provides a convenient strategy for rapidly perturbing and testing genes of interest for phenotypes, independently validating the knockdowns with genetic mutants, or alternatively (if genes are essential), degron alleles.</p>
<p>Impact:</p>
<p>The TRAP-seq data and list of differentially-expressed candidate genes will form an interesting set of high-priority candidates to study for their role in the reception and transduction of nutritional cues in response to food status and pathogens. This data will thus benefit the C. elegans community of researchers studying the mechanisms governing these phenomena.</p>
