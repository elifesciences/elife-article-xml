<abstract>
<title>Abstract</title><p>Medulloblastoma (MB) is the most common malignant brain tumour in children. The Sonic Hedgehog (SHH)-medulloblastoma subtype arises from the cerebellar granule neuron lineage. Terminally differentiated neurons are incapable of undergoing further cell division, so an effective treatment for this tumour could be to force neuronal differentiation. Differentiation therapy provides a potential alternative for patients with medulloblastoma who harbor mutations that impair cell death pathways (TP53), which is associated a with high mortality. To this end, our goal was to explore epigenetic regulation of cerebellar granule neuron differentiation in medulloblastoma cells. Key regulators were discovered using chromatin immunoprecipitation with high-throughput sequencing. DNA-bound protein and chromatin protein modifications were investigated across all genes. We discovered that Ezh2-mediated tri-methylation of the H3 histone (H3K27me3), occurred on more than half of the 787 genes whose transcription normally increases as granule neurons terminally differentiate. Conditional knockout of <italic>Ezh2</italic> led to early initiation of differentiation in granule neuron precursors (GNPs), but only after cell cycle exit had occurred. Similarly, in MB cells, neuronal differentiation could be induced by preventing H3K27me3 modifications using an Ezh2 inhibitor (UNC1999), but only when UNC1999 was combined with forced cell cycle exit driven by a CDK4/6 inhibitor (Palbociclib). Ezh2 emerges as a powerful restraint upon post-mitotic differentiation during normal GNP development and combination of Ezh2 inhibition with cell cycle exit leads to MB cell differentiation.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The Hedgehog (Hh) pathway is one of the major regulators of cerebellar granule neuron precursor (GNP) proliferation. Sonic hedgehog (Shh) protein secreted from Purkinje neurons drives proliferation of GNPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>) through transcriptional regulation of <italic>Cyclin D1</italic> and <italic>N-myc</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>) among other targets. Despite ongoing exposure to Shh, GNPs leave the cell cycle and undergo timed and reliable differentiation, a switch that occurs correctly about 50 billion times in the developing human brain. When differentiation and neurogenesis fail, for example due to Shh pathway mutations that lead to unrestrained Shh target gene activation, GNPs continue to proliferate and may form medulloblastomas (MBs). Yet even in genetic models of MB that are 100% penetrant, where Shh target genes are dramatically activated, the vast majority of GNPs still differentiate into functional granule neurons (GNs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>). Thus, regulation that promotes differentiation has the potential to overcome a potent mitogenic signal.</p>
<p>GNPs are the cell type of origin for the Shh subtype of MBs, which make up a quarter to a third of MBs. Children with Shh MB are treated intensively with surgical resection followed by craniospinal radiation, one year of multi-drug chemotherapy, and targeted inhibition of the Hh pathway using Smo inhibitors. Unfortunately, in patients with germline Hh pathway mutations, or intratumoral mutations in <italic>P53</italic>, the five-year overall survival is halved, from 81% to 41% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>). Making matters worse, patients with <italic>P53</italic> mutations often have amplifications in downstream targets like <italic>GLI2</italic> and <italic>NMYC</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>), meaning that they will not respond to inhibitors that target the SMO protein.</p>
<p>An alternative therapeutic approach is to force tumor cells into terminal differentiation, which can be less toxic than alkylating chemotherapy or radiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>) and does not rely on apoptosis or other cell death machinery. The optimal procedure for inducing terminal differentiation is likely to vary from cell type to cell type, since differentiation of neurons depends on different genes than, for example, differentiating blood cells. Neuronal differentiation of MB does occur spontaneously, as it has been commonly observed in human MB pathology specimens for over 30 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>). BMP4 induces differentiation of MB cells, reflecting its normal effect on GNPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>). Unfortunately, no pharmaceutical BMP agonist currently exists. Developmental regulation of cerebellar granule neurons potentially provides us with blueprints for engineering a differentiation therapy that is specific to Shh-subtype MB differentiation.</p>
<p>GNPs undergo approximately eight symmetric divisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>), during transit amplification in the external granule layer (EGL) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>). As GNPs divide they travel inward from the pial surface, eventually exiting the cell cycle. GNP movement, morphogenesis, and synapse formation lasts for about 10 days after cell cycle exit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>). Following the last mitosis the cells remain in the inner EGL (iEGL) for approximately 48 hours. While in the iEGL the GNs begin to extend two lateral processes, then a deep process (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref>). Each GN nucleus migrates inward through the deep process, along Bergmann glia and past the Purkinje cell layer, into the Internal Granule Layer (IGL). The final shape of a GN is a T, with most of the cell’s three processes located in the molecular layer and the nucleus in the IGL. For each step of GNP differentiation, positive and negative regulators have been discovered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>). The extensive movement and morphological changes involve the changing expression of hundreds of genes, as shown by recent transcriptional profiling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>).</p>

<p>We set out to explore epigenetic regulation of genes whose expression increases during differentiation. Many genes whose transcription change during differentiation encode chromatin-remodeling complexes, implying coordination at the level of transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>). In addition, SHH MB harbor somatic mutations in genes which impact a number chromatin modifying complexes including genes that impact H3 methylation at K27 and K4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>). A mechanism that represses pro-differentiation genes potentially could be inhibited by an anti-cancer drug and would potentially stimulate differentiation of MBs.</p>
<p>Our plan was to comprehensively describe histone modifications and critical transcription factors at promoters and enhancers of genes that become active during GNP development, to discover inhibitors of differentiation. We found that more than half of the GNP differentiation genes are associated with histones modified to be H3K27me3 and H3K4me3. H3K27 methylation is carried out by the Enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) histone methyltransferase, a component of one of the Polycomb Repressive Complexes (PRC2) that were discovered in Drosophila (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>). H3K4me3 is formed by the MLL complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>) and was not further investigated in our studies. The frequency of H3K27 modifications suggested that inhibition or mutation of EZH2 could lead to premature differentiation, and perhaps to differentiation and growth cessation by MB cells. In <italic>Ezh2</italic> mouse mutants we observed accelerated differentiation of GNPs that had exited the cell cycle. We were able to induce differentiation of MB cells by combining an EZH2 inhibitor with a CDK4/6 inhibitor that arrested cells in G0.</p>

<title>Identification of genes activated at the onset of GNP differentiation</title>
<p>We used Percoll fractionation to enrich for GNPs from wild-type mouse cerebella at three key stages, proliferation initiation (P1), peak proliferation (P7), and the onset of differentiation (P14), and then extracted RNA (Materials and Methods; the RNA preparations used are diagrammed in blue in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>). We purified earlier-stage GNPs from E15.5 mouse embryos; these had seen little or no Shh (Materials and Methods). E15.5-stage GNPs were also isolated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) from E15.5 mice harboring a <italic>Math1-GFP</italic> reporter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>). <italic>Math1-GFP</italic> is expressed in neural progenitor cells from the dorsal neural tube, adjacent to the roof plate, that are committed to a GNP lineage. The reporter remains active until GNPs complete their final mitosis.</p>
<p>Data for GNPs from stages later than P14 were obtained using the Translating Ribosome Affinity Purification (TRAP) dataset made available by the Hatten lab (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>). TRAP data were obtained by purifying mRNA from post-proliferative stages of GNP differentiation (P18, P28) in cells expressing <italic>NeuroD1,</italic> which is transcribed as GNs exit from the cell cycle. TRAP has the benefit of allowing detection and quantification of RNA in the delicate granule neuron processes which are otherwise lost when cerebellar tissue is broken up. <italic>NeuroD1</italic> is not expressed at E15, so earlier time points were not accessible using TRAP. Our RNAseq data were combined with the NeuroD1-TRAP data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>) to achieve a picture of transcription from the earliest stages of GNP formation at E15 to their terminal state at P56.</p>
<p>To identify genes that increase transcription during differentiation we followed a multistep process (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>). First, genes were excluded if their transcript level was below a cutoff, established using the maximum expression time point of each dataset in both our RNAseq and the Hatten lab TRAP data, and fitting a mixture of two probability distributions to the bimodal data (expressed and unexpressed). Next, we excluded genes that were potentially contaminants from other cell types. Percoll-fractionated samples from P7 mouse cerebellum typically contain about 95% GNPs and 5% contaminating cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>, blue v. gray). Genes that are highly expressed in non-GNP cerebellar cells, and scarcely expressed in GNPs, were identified and excluded based upon single-cell RNAseq (scRNAseq) of the developing mouse cerebellum from E10 to P14 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>). 1874 genes that were represented by transcripts in bulk cerebellar RNA were determined to be likely contaminants based upon the results of the scRNAseq. Third, genes that vary substantially during the cell cycle were removed as well.</p>
<p>GNP differentiation genes were grouped according to when during development they had maximum transcript abundance. Genes whose transcript levels changed less than 2-fold between developmental stages were categorized as unchanged.</p>
<p>2050 genes were most highly represented in RNA between P14 and P56 and were categorized as differentiation genes. Some peaked early in differentiation, and some peaked during maximal GNP proliferation from P1 to P7. We used the time at which a gene’s transcript reached 50% of its maximum (t50) to describe when genes were undergoing the most transcriptional changes (Fig S1A-C). If a gene reached 50% of its maximum transcript level before P0 it was set aside. Our focus on differentiation therapy means we are primarily interested in genes that increase after the period of peak proliferation, as this is most similar to MB.</p>
<p>787 genes increased 4-fold to 12.4 fold at or after P14, comparing the lowest to highest contiguous time points, and were categorized as differentiation genes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1C</xref> and Supplemental Table 1). Many of the differentiation genes are involved in neuronal function with 181 genes impacting membrane potential or synaptic signalling, which includes 45 ion channels and 45 transporters. Genes involved in cell morphogenesis make up another 57 genes including cell adhesion proteins and another 28 proteins involved in the cytoskeleton. In addition to these terminal effectors of building a functional neuron we also see an increase in 50 transcription factors, which could have extensive downstream impact on transcription (Supplemental Table 2).</p>
<p>Transcripts of a different set of 440 genes were highest (&gt;= 4 fold) during proliferative stages P0-P7. As expected, these proliferation genes included <italic>Gli1,</italic> a direct transcriptional target of the Shh signal transduction pathway that drives GNP proliferation, as well as cell cycle regulators including the G1/S phase cyclin <italic>Ccnd1.</italic> The majority of the genes that have <italic>lower</italic> RNA abundance as GNPs approach cell cycle exit are known regulators or components of the cell cycle such as components of the E2f-Rb complex which controls expression of S-phase cell cycle related genes. Transcript levels for a third set of 783 genes were highest (&gt;= 4-fold change) in the E15 pre-Shh GNPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>).</p>
<p>We checked a putative differentiation gene to see if its protein abundance reflected the observed changes in RNA levels. P7 cerebellar sections (Fig S1E) and GNPs differentiated <italic>in vitro</italic> (Fig S1F,G) had changes in protein abundance that agree with the RNASeq results. <italic>Cbx7</italic> was among the differentiation genes that had increased transcripts at P14 compared to P7. Levels of Cbx7 proteins increase in the inner EGL and further in the IGL (Fig S1E), where GNPs have recently exited the cell cycle and initiated the first stages of differentiation.</p>
<p>GNP division, differentiation, and migration can occur during a wide developmental window, from P3 to P10 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>). The densely packed nuclei within the EGL and IGL preclude accurate quantification of protein levels. To avoid these problems we used GNP culture, which permits accurate and automated single-cell quantification. The murine <italic>Math1</italic> bHLH transcription factor was used to distinguish dividing from non-dividing cultured GNPs. <italic>Math1</italic> expression stops when the GNPs stop dividing. <italic>Math-1</italic> reporter GFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>) fluorescence allows classification of GNPs as differentiated or proliferating. To estimate the changes in Cbx7 during differentiation in culture we compared 6h Atoh1 high cells (dividing GNPs) to 48 h Atoh1 low cells (differentiated GNs). Cbx7 was 3.3 times higher in the differentiated GNs then the dividing GNPs (Fig S1 D-G).</p>
<p>The transcription of the 787 differentiation genes varies in the exact timing of transcription activation, as reflected in Fig S1A. A regulator of a set of differentiation genes, among the 787, might be a good target for therapeutic manipulation to force MB cells to differentiate. Based upon gene expression patterns, SHH-subgroup MB cells are highly similar to Shh-exposed dividing P7 GNPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>). Both cell types rely on Hh signaling as a mitogen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>). Mutations of Hh components in the GNP lineage are adequate to induce medulloblastomas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>). Further experiments examining epigenetic regulators therefore focused on P7 GNPs.</p>

<title>The chromatin repression modification H3K27me3 is present in P7 GNPs on half the 787 differentiation genes, and correlates with H3K4me3 and poised RNA Pol2</title>
<p>To gain insight into the transcriptional regulation of differentiation genes, we investigated the chromatin state of P7 GNPs. The positions and abundance of six histone modifications and two chromatin-associated proteins were measured using ChIP-Seq: H3K27me3, H3K27ac, H3K36me3, H3K4me3, H3K4me1, H2Aubi119, Ring1b, and Pol2S5. We selected the histone modifications and known chromatin bound proteins for ChIP based on known markers of promoters, enhancers, and to broadly assess transcriptional repression.</p>
<p>Modifications associated with Polycomb-mediated transcriptional repression were mapped, including H3K27me3, which is produced by the PRC2 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>), H2Aubi119, which is produced by the PRC1 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>), and Ring1b, which is a core component of the PRC1 complex and is the ubiquitin ligase that catalyzes H2Aubi119 modifications.</p>
<p>Another form of transcriptional repression employs CpG island DNA methylation. DNA methylation was measured using methylated-CpG island recovery assay (MIRA), which uses recombinant MBD protein to bind double-stranded methylated DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>).</p>
<p>Protein modifications at active promoter regions were assessed, including H3K4me3, S5-phosphorylated RNA polymerase 2 (Pol2S5), (which labels paused RNA polymerase), H3K4me1 (which is associated with active enhancer regions), and H3K27ac (which is found at active promoters and enhancers) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>). DNA accessibility was assessed by ATAC-Seq, which is based upon the bias for Tn5 transposition towards open chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>). To quantify the amount of a histone modification at a given gene we quantified the number of reads within 250 BP of the transcriptional start site (TSS). Several of the histone modifications, including the transcriptionally repressive modifications accumulate at the TSS and extend towards the gene body and upstream (Fig S2C,D). This extension of the histone modifications has been shown to be biologically relevant for H3K27ac at super-enhancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>) and for H3K27me3 at permanently repressed genes like Hox genes. To better separate strongly marked genes from moderately marked genes we extended the quantified region to include significantly bound DNA regions farther from the TSS (Materials &amp; Methods).</p>
<p>Of all the histone modifications and histone-associated proteins assessed for selective presence with the differentiation genes, the frequent presence of H3K27me3 was most striking. Of the 787 differentiation genes 447 (57%) had H3K27me3 within 250 BP of the TSS (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2B</xref>). To identify important modifications we calculated enrichment, meaning the amount of a modification in the 787 differentiation genes compared to the amount in either all genes or in expressed genes during the GNP time-course. H3K27me3 was 2.3 times more frequent near differentiation genes compared to all expressed genes at P7 (p-val 7.54×10<sup>-147</sup>, hypergeometric BH adjusted) and 2.7 times more frequent compared to all genes (p-val 7.14×10<sup>-198</sup>, hypergeometric BH adjusted) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). H2Aubi119, a repressive modification made by Ring1b, a component of the PRC1 complex, was also more frequent at the differentiation gene set with 2.17 enrichment over all genes (p-val 1.15×10<sup>-245</sup>, hypergeometric BH adjusted) and 1.89 over all expressed genes at P7 (p-val 3.71×10<sup>-156</sup>, hypergeometric BH adjusted).</p>

</fig>
<p>The frequent presence of H3K27me3 modifications suggests that PRC2 may repress differentiation genes during GNP transit amplification. The PRC2 complex contains the methyltransferase EZH2, which carries out H3K27 methylation. From past studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>) we know that PRC2 is present at specific chromatin regions, where it functions as a transcriptional repressor. The amount of H3K27me3 present regulates whether repression is temporary (moderate levels) or permanent (high levels) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>). The differentiation genes have a moderate amount of H3K27me3 (Fig S2A-C). Only three differentiation genes had high levels of H3K27me3. The other, non-differentiation, genes within the high H3K27me3 group included Hox cluster and transcription factors associated with alternative fates or earlier lineages. As an example, <italic>Cbx7</italic>, a differentiation gene, has moderate K27me3 while Lhx9 and Hoxa10 have high K27me3 (Fig SC). Very highly H3K27me3-modified genes are thought to be permanently repressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>).</p>
<p>In addition to the amount of H3K27me3, whether PRC2 repression is transient or long-lived depends on its association with other histone marks or protein complexes. For example, H3K27 methylation may occur in association with active-gene modifications such as H3K4me4 and/or poised RNA polymerase II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>). This kind of arrangement is known as a bivalent promoter, transcriptionally repressed but poised for increased transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>). In contrast, PRC2 can establish more permanent repression when associated with certain PRC1 variants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>). However, these are heterogeneous complexes, and changing select PRC1 subunits allows the association with bivalent promoters as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>). H3K27me3 can recruit the machinery for DNA methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>), driving permanent repression.</p>
<p>To distinguish possible roles of PRC2 in GNPs we examined the relationship between H3K27me3 and H2Aubi119 (a marker of PRC1 complex) or H3K4me4 (a marker of active promoters) at differentiation genes that have H3K27me3. H3K27me3-marked differentiation genes have both H3K4me3 and PRC1 complex (H2Aubi119). DNA methylation was detected in only 4 percent of differentiation genes, indicating that this form of repression is mostly not active there.</p>
<p>The association of H3K27me3 with other modifications at differentiation genes is represented as a chart (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2B</xref>). Each modification is represented by a column that shows the numbers of modified and unmodified genes. The columns are organized from left to right according to the number of genes that are also marked by H3K27me3. The red band shows genes containing H3K27me3 which share other modifications. Of the 447 H3K27me3-marked differentiation genes, 87 % also had H3K4me3 and 84.3% had paused RNA polymerase. PRC1 occupancy on the H3K27me3-bound differentiation genes was frequent: 89 % of the 447 genes had significant H2Aubi119. The frequent associations between H3K27me3 and H2Aubi119 or H3K4me3 are also seen with a scatter plot (Fig S2 D,E), where 373 (83%) of the differentiation genes bear all three modifications.</p>
<p>Thus at P7 many of the 447 differentiation genes had nearby PRC2 complexes, PRC1 complexes, and markers of active promotors such as H3K4me3 and RNA Pol2Ser5P (paused RNA polymerase 2). These results suggest that about half of the differentiation genes have bivalent or poised promoters containing both PRC2 and PRC1. Removal of these modifications in the normal course of development, or engineered removal in MB cells, may cause de-repression of these genes and early differentiation.</p>

<title>Ezh2-mediated H3K27 methylation delays differentiation of GNPs</title>
<p>The H3K27me3 histone modification, associated with gene repression, is enzymatically carried out by the protein complex PRC2. The presence of H3K27me3 modifications at 447 GN differentiation genes at the P7 stage suggests that PRC2 may be blocking differentiation. In that case differentiation of GNs, or perhaps MBs, would require relief from PRC2 repression. We tested this hypothesis using mice carrying a mutation in <italic>Ezh2</italic>, which is the enzymatic component of PRC2 that catalyzes formation of H3K27me3. Homozygous <italic>Ezh2</italic> knockout mice die as embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>), so studying postnatal cerebellar development required conditional knockout mice. Mice with LoxP sites flanking the DNA encoding the SET domain of <italic>Ezh2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>) were crossed with <italic>Math1-Cre</italic> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>). The SET domain is required for Ezh2 to function as a methyltransferase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>) and maternal depletion of the SET domain in mice causes significant growth retardation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>).</p>
<p>As a consequence of crossing the <italic>Ezh2</italic> Lox-P mice with the <italic>Math1-Cre</italic> mice, H3K27me3 is reduced in the granule neurons (Fig S3 A-C). <italic>Ezh1</italic>, a paralog of <italic>Ezh2</italic> that is present throughout GN development is a weaker methyltransferase than <italic>Ezh2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>). Even with <italic>Ezh1</italic> functioning, conditional loss of <italic>Ezh2</italic> led to dramatic loss of H3K27me3 from GNPs and GNs, as shown in P7 cerebellar slices (Fig S3 A panel II vs VI, yellow arrow) and cultured GNPs (Fig S3 C panel II vs IV, yellow arrow).</p>
<p>The most notable phenotype of the <italic>Ezh2</italic> cKO mice is a blurring of the boundary between the inner external granular layer (iEGL) and the molecular layer (ML; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3B-C</xref>, magenta and cyan arrow). GNs within the inner EGL (iEGL) permanently exit the cell cycle and remain there as they extend parallel fibers. GNs within the iEGL express the cell cycle inhibitor p27. In the <italic>Ezh2</italic> cKO the iEGL is more diffuse and blends into the ML (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3A</xref> compare cyan arrows). To facilitate quantification of the EGL blurring we collapsed 2D fluorescent images into line segments (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3D</xref>). P7 cerebellar slices were stained with anti-p27 to label post-mitotic EGL cells, NeuN antibody to identify the IGL, and DAPI to mark all nuclei. For each channel, measurements were made along a line from the pial border on the outside to the IGL. The 581 lines (266 WT and 315 <italic>Ezh2</italic> cKO) were aligned and averaged, in sets according to genotype (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3E</xref>). The normalized p27 intensities show a spreading of iEGL, blurring the boundaries with the IGL and ML. The ML blurring, was quantified as an increase in the p27 at the junction of the iEGL and ML in the <italic>Ezh2</italic> cKO (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3D</xref>; compare the cyan arrows). To quantify across replicates, we compared <italic>Ezh2</italic> cKO and WT at a point within the ML where the <italic>Ezh2</italic> cKO had the highest relative p27 fluorescence (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3E</xref>).</p>

<p>The sizes of the layers of the cerebellum are largely unaffected by <italic>Ezh2</italic> cKO (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3G,H</xref>). <bold>T</bold>he different layers of the cerebellum were measured in slices stained with anti-p27, NeuN antibody, and DAPI (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3F</xref>). No significant differences were observed in the thicknesses of the oEGL, iEGL, ML, or IGL (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3G,H</xref>). Due to the diffuse EGL/IGL-ML boundary in the cKO, p27 fluorescence intensities within the iEGL (where GNPs begin differentiation) and IGL (where post-mitotic GNs reside) were reduced 25% and 23% (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3I</xref>). These findings are consistent with the loss of <italic>Ezh2</italic> function not altering the overall structure of the cerebellum, but instead specifically affecting GN differentiation.</p>
<p><italic>Ezh2 cKO<sup>-</sup></italic> GNPs labeled with a 48 h EDU pulse migrated from the EGL prematurely (Fig. S3 D-F). To distinguish early migration out of the oEGL from stalled GN migration within the ML, GNPs going through S-phase were labeled with EDU and harvested 48 hours later. In WT mice there is dense EDU labeling of the iEGL, and GNs lining up along the border with the ML (Fig S3 D, panel III versus VIII, yellow arrows). In the <italic>Ezh2</italic> cKO, EDU<bold>-</bold>labeled cells are within the diffuse iEGL and within the ML (p-val 0.024), mirroring what was seen with p27 immunofluorescence (Fig S3E,F). We conclude that, in <italic>Ezh2</italic> mutant mice, GNs prematurely exit from the EGL into the ML, a movement typical of wild-type GNs that have stopped dividing.</p>
<p>The hypothesis that PRC2 blocks cell differentiation is consistent with the <italic>Ezh2</italic> mutant results, because early de-repression of differentiation genes would cause premature EGL cell migration.</p>
<p>GNPs cultured from <italic>Ezh2</italic> cKO mice, compared to normal, had more differentiated cells but the same fraction of dividing cells. That fits with the idea that loss of <italic>Ezh2</italic> allows premature activation of differentiation genes. To further test the impact of <italic>Ezh2</italic> cKO on differentiation, we cultured GNPs with Shh and monitored <italic>Map2</italic> (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A,C</xref>), a marker for process extension, and <italic>NeuN</italic>, a marker of differentiated GNs. Process extension was measured using Neuroncyto 2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>), which reveals cell processes and assigns them to a cell body (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B,D</xref>). <italic>Ezh2</italic> cKO GNPs had a 37.6% increase (p-val 0.007) in average process length compared to control (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4E</xref>).</p>

<p>Next, we separated the cells into groups based upon process length (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4F</xref>). WT cells had a 19.2 % higher proportion of cells with no process (49.2 % WT vs. 30% in <italic>Ezh2</italic> cKO; p-val 0.019) or a process less than 5 pixels long (p-val 0.0047). <italic>Ezh2</italic> cKO cells had processes 10 pixels and longer 20.1% more often (39.3 WT versus 59.4 <italic>Ezh2</italic> cKO). Thus loss of <italic>Ezh2</italic> led to more of the longer processes, an indicator of differentiation, in cultured GNPs.</p>
<p>Cell cycle stage and differentiation were quantified using staining for DAPI (to show all nuclei), Ki67 (to show dividing cells), and NeuN (to show post-mitotic neurons) (Fig S4A). The fraction of total cells that were NeuN-positive in <italic>Ezh2</italic> cKO cultures was 13.9 % compared to 9.8 % in WT (p-val 0.008) (Fig S4C). The amount of NeuN fluorescence increases on the per-cell histogram (Fig S4B). No significant change in the number of cells that were in G1 (p-val 0.107) or G2 (p-val 0.087) occurred, with cells more often being in G1 in <italic>Ezh2</italic> cKO and in G2 in WT (Fig. S4C). <italic>Ezh2</italic> appears to be a cell-intrinsic regulator of differentiation timing; its loss hastens process extension and nuclear migration out of the EGL.</p>

<title>During normal development, <italic>Ezh2</italic> transcript and protein levels decrease as GNPs differentiate</title>

<p>In MB cells, as in dividing GNPs, repressive chromatin regulators may prevent expression of GN differentiation genes to maintain a pro-proliferative state.

As expected, MB transcripts correlated most with transcripts from rapidly dividing P7 GNPs (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.79) compared to P1 (R<sup>2</sup> = 073, Fig S6 B) or P14 (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.52, Fig S6 C).</p>

Cycling MB cells have high Atoh1 and low p27 if in G1/S/G2 (green in Fig. S8A) or high p27 if in G0 (yellow in Figure S8A).

<p>Untreated MB cultures had 70.2/43.6% (pRb high / Atoh1 high p27 low) dividing cells and 2.0/14.2% (NeuN high / Atoh1 low p27 high) differentiating cells. Cultures treated with Ezh2 inhibitor (5 uM UNC1999) had 50.4/18.6% (pRB high /Atoh high p27 high) dividing cells and 4.6/ 35.2% (NeuN high / Atoh1 low p27 high) differentiating cells (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig 8B</xref>, Fig S8B). Ezh2 inhibition caused a 21 % increase in the fraction of differentiated cells, based upon measuring Atoh1 and p27 (p-val &lt; 0.001) and a 2.6 % increase in NeuN positive cells (p-val &lt; 0.001). For UNC1999, previous studies of cultured cells showed that a dose of 1 to 5 uM caused substantial reduction in H3K27me3 activity without substantial toxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref>). Thus induction of differentiation genes using Ezh2 inhibitor reduced but did not stop MB cell growth, in keeping with a lack of effect on MB frequency due to genetic removal of Ezh2 function. <italic>Ptch1<sup>+/-</sup></italic> mice were crossed with <italic>Ezh2<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic>Math1-Cre mice. About 15% of the <italic>Ptch1<sup>+/-</sup></italic> mice develop MBs. <italic>Ezh2</italic> cKO did not affect the rate of MB formation in <italic>Ptch1<sup>+/-</sup></italic> mice. MB formation occurred in 14.86% (n = 74) who were Cre<sup>+/-</sup> and 14.28 % (n = 84) in Cre<sup>-/-</sup> animals.</p>
<p>Normal development may be informative about how to stop MB cells from growing. During normal differentiation, GNPs would first enter G0 arrest, then GNP differentiation genes would be de-repressed as Ezh2 is reduced. To stop MB cell proliferation, the same two steps might be required: going into G0 arrest and then differentiating. MB cultures treated with CDK4/6 inhibitor (1 uM Palbociclib) to drive them into G0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref>), had 18.1/15.4% (pRb high / Atoh high p27 low) dividing cells and 15.9/26.0 % differentiating cells (NeuN high / Atoh1 low p27 high). Thus an inhibitor that pushes MB cells toward G0 is does increase rates differentiation more than the Ezh2 inhibitors alone but still at relatively low rates (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig 8B</xref>, Fig S8B).</p>
<p>Dual treatment with Ezh2 inhibitor and CDK4/6 inhibitor produced the highest percentage of terminally differentiating MB cells 22.8/43.0 % (NeuN high / Atoh1 low p27 high) with only 9/6.8 % (pRb high / Atoh1 high p27 low) percent of cells dividing (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig 8B</xref>, Fig S8B). The combination of Ezh2 inhibitors and CDK4/6 inhibitors increased the rate of differentiation by 7% for NeuN positive cells (p-val 0.004) and 17% for low of Atoh1 with high p27 (p-val &lt; 0.001). MB cells treated with both 5uM UNC1999 and 1um Palbociclib developed thin neuron-like processes, that contain the F-actin stain phalloidin (Fig S8B xiii). In contrast, after treatment with CDK4/6 inhibitor alone, no such processes were observed and the cells appeared similar to dividing MB cells (Fig S8B x). It should be noted that differentiated GN require changes to the media for long term survival which could limit the time an MB cell could survive late into neuronal differentiation.</p>
<p>Combining a CDK4/6 inhibitor with an Ezh2 inhibitor could be toxic to dividing cells. The increase in percentage of differentiated cells would then reflect more robust survival of differentiated cells vs proliferating cells. If selective survival explained the results, then the absolute number of differentiated cells should be similar in untreated and doubly treated cells. Instead, combining 5uM UNC1999 and 1 uM Palbociclib produced 2.2 to 4.68 times more differentiated cells compared to control cells not treated with any drug (Fig S8C). This suggests that combining Ezh2 and CDK4/6 inhibitors drove conversion of dividing cells into differentiated cells, rather than causing selective death of dividing cells.</p>
<p>A key advantage of differentiation therapy over anti-proliferative approaches is that terminally differentiated neurons should not re-enter the cell cycle even after the treatment is terminated. MB cells in culture were treated with 1 uM of the CDK4/6 inhibitor alone or in the presence of various doses of Ezh2 inhibitor. After 72 hrs, all drugs were washed out and the cells cultured for an additional 24 h (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8C</xref>). As previously, cells were labeled using anti-pRb (Ser807/811) and NeuN (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8D</xref>). When CDK4/6 inhibitor was used alone, following drug wash out 40.8 % of MB cells re-entered the cell cycle (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig 8E</xref>). Thus, with only CDK4/6 inhibition, MB cells can rapidly re-enter the cell cycle. Only 14.2 % of cells treated with both inhibitors re-entered G1/2. Again, we saw an increase fraction of differentiated from 14.5 % of cells to 21.9% (p-val 0.006) (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig 8E</xref>) and in the total number of differentiated cells by 1.68 times (p-val 0.016) comparing dual Ezh2 and CDK4/6 inhibitors compared to CDK4/6 inhibitors alone (Fig S8D). The combination of Ezh2 inhibitors with CDK4/6 mediated cell cycle arrest achieves the most important therapeutic goal, to irreversibly prevent cell cycle re-entry.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The parallels between early cerebellar development and MB formation provide an opportunity to study key regulators of normal development in the context of tumor cells, with the goal of stopping tumor growth. During normal cerebellar development, GNPs proliferate under the mitogenic effect of the Sonic hedgehog pathway. Following a period of transit amplification, GNPs exit the cell cycle and terminally differentiate into granule neurons, the most abundant neuron in the brain (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>). In MBs, the SHH pathway is aberrantly activated through mutations that inactivate inhibitory elements of the pathway (eg Patched or Sufu) or through amplification of activating elements (eg <italic>Gli2</italic> amplification). As a result, cells fail to exit the cell cycle and can ultimately give rise to a tumor. A large body of evidence describes the morphological (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref>), transcriptional (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref>), and post-translational modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref>) similarities between transit-amplifying GNPs and medulloblastomas.</p>

<title>Ezh2-mediated H3K27me3 broadly represses differentiation genes in GNPS and MBs</title>
<p>Here we undertook a genome-wide identification of the epigenetic regulators and transcriptional changes that occur during the initiation of proliferation, peak proliferation, and early stages of differentiation in GNPs. In agreement with other groups, we find that many genes whose transcription increases as GNPs differentiate have bivalent promoters, with H3K27me3 and H3K4me3 modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref>). Our study also shows PRC1 occupancy at the majority of the H3K27me3-marked differentiation genes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>). Most PRC1 complex variants and the PRC2 complexes are involved in transcriptional repression, which allows a transient repression of genes required during differentiation.

<title>Bivalent H3K27me3 and H3K4me3 modifications delay transcription of specific gene sets during GNP cell cycle exit</title>
<p>For a cell with complex cytoarchitecture like a neuron, it is important to turn on the correct genes during differentiation and to have those genes turn on at the correct time. Ezh2 is transcriptionally activated by the pRb/E2f1 complex during S-phase expression(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">75</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">76</xref>). In GNPs the bivalent H3K27me3 and H3K4me3 modifications mark a subset of genes that appear to be sensitive to the drop in Ezh2 function. The subsequent transcriptional activation of genes associated with neuronal differentiation, like ion channels, can in this way be reliably linked to cell cycle exit. The reduction of Ezh2 protein (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5</xref>) that occurs as GNPs complete their cell division stage is likely to promote terminal cell cycle exit by allowing de-repression of differentiation genes.</p>
<p>What determines the exact timing of transcriptional activation for a given differentiation gene is likely multifactorial. Kdm6b, an enzyme that removes H3K27me3 methylations, significantly influences timing during GNP differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">77</xref>). The abundance of Kdm6b across the H3K27me3 marked differentiation genes may be non-uniform, activating some genes earlier than others. The PRC1 complex has numerous variants, which could fine tune the required delays in GNP differentiation gene expression timing. Another path of H3K27me3 elimination can be replicative dilution, where H3K27me3 modifications are depleted by ongoing cell division following Ezh2 activity reduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>). In GNPs, the drop in <italic>Ezh2</italic> expression happens as cells exit the cell cycle, so replicative dilution does not seem to be an important factor.</p>

<p><italic>Ezh2</italic> cKO allowed early differentiation of GNPs but did not have an impact on transit-amplifying GNPs. During GNP cell division, Ezh2 is highly expressed.

<title>H3K27me3-marked differentiation genes have known GN differentiation phenotypes</title>
<p>Many H3K27me3-marked differentiation genes have known neuronal differentiation phenotypes in cerebellar GNs. One important example is the voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel genes, which have been linked to GN migration. Of the six channel genes that increase transcription during differentiation, five are modified by H3K27me3. Loss of function of these genes impairs normal GN differentiation. Knockout of <italic>Cacna1a</italic> which codes for Cav2.1 showed clear migration defect in the EGL, with persistence of the EGL at P21 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">79</xref>). Another potent regulator of Ca<sup>2+</sup> that is critical to GN migration is the NMDA receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">80</xref>), which is a ligand-gated glutamate channel. The genes for all four NMDA subunits that transcriptionally increase (NR2BA-D), are modified by H3K27me3. Functional NMDA receptors form when the radially migrating GNs start migrating into the ML (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">81</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">82</xref>). NMDA receptors undergo subunit switching between migrating and post migratory receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">83</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">84</xref>). Genetically altering subunit composition leads to an increased rate in migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">85</xref>) and persistent EGL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">86</xref>), while blocking NMDA receptors reduces migration(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">87</xref>). The targets of Ezh2 have developmental phenotypes, and the timing of their production matters.</p>
<p>Bdnf and multiple CAMK components that transduce its signal are also H3K27me3-modified. BDNF signaling is a well-established regulator of GN radial migration. The knockout of <italic>Bdnf</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">88</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">89</xref>) or of its downstream pathway components <italic>CaMKKII</italic> or <italic>CaMKIV</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">90</xref>) all cause GN migration defects. The opposite phenotype occurs in response to over-activation of the Bdnf pathway, decreasing the time to differentiation. Transfection of GNPs with a constitutively active CREB, the terminal transcriptional activator of BDNF signaling, accelerated terminal differentiation of GNPs in culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">91</xref>).</p>
<p>From a differentiation therapy perspective, not all differentiation genes are equal. The greatest interest lies with genes that could be activated to prevent subsequent re-entry into the cell cycle. Attempted cell division in differentiated neurons typically leads to cell death as seen with neurodegenerative disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c92">92</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c95">95</xref>) or to binucleated cells as seen with gangliogliomas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c96">96</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c97">97</xref>). Our present results suggest several candidate differentiation genes, but another approach is to manipulate Ezh2 directly and thereby control many of these genes simultaneously.</p>

<title>Ezh2 inhibitors as a potential differentiation therapy</title>
<p>EZH2 inhibitors have been tested in SHH-subtype MB cells and have caused decreased cell viability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c98">98</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c99">99</xref>) and increased rates of differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c100">100</xref>).

<p>Our data provide genome-wide context for the previous work by identifying the large number of H3K27me3-modified genes during development and in MB cells.

<title>Combined Ezh2 inhibition and cell cycle arrest as a differentiation therapy</title>
<p>A prevailing hope is that properly stimulated differentiation can override tumor cell proliferation, for MB and other cancer types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c101">101</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c103">103</xref>).

Given its transformative effect in AML, RA was trialed for patients diagnosed with MB in hopes of similarly driving differentiation and long-term regression. Unfortunately, RA did not prove effective in MB and phase 2 trials were ultimately halted. RA does cause growth arrest of MB tumous (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c108">108</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c109">109</xref>), but through apoptosis rather than induced differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c110">110</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c111">111</xref>).</p>
<p>Our work suggests a nuanced relationship between proliferation and differentiation in GNPs and MB cells. Ezh2 appears to have a significant role in delaying activation of differentiation genes but <italic>Ezh2</italic> loss or inhibition is not capable overriding the cell cycle. <italic>Ezh2</italic> cKO did not reduce GNP proliferation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref>) and there was only a marginal increase in differentiation with Ezh2 inhibition alone (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig 8</xref>). Neuronal differentiation is a complex process and understanding where and how a given regulator fits into that process is critical to maximizing its use as a clinical differentiation therapy.</p>
<p>Additional observations raise concerns about using EZH2 inhibitors as a solo differentiation therapy. First, <italic>Ezh2</italic> cKO did not prevent MB formation in mouse models of MB. SmoM2 mice, who develop MB from unrestrained Hh signalling were crossed with Math1-Cre / Ezh2fl/fl developed MB at 100% penetrance as in normal SmoM2 control mice. The MBs from the <italic>Ezh2</italic> cKO mice were more aggressive than control SmoM2 with intact <italic>Ezh2</italic>, leading to early death of the mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">78</xref>). <italic>Ezh2</italic> cKO, in Ptch1<sup>+/-</sup> mice also showed no impact on the rate of MB formation. The reduction in H3K27me3 with <italic>Ezh2</italic> cKO is substantial, exceeding what is possible with an Ezh2 inhibitor, so using Ezh2 inhibitors alone is unlikely to yield differentiation rates high enough to reduce cancer progression. Another concern is that <italic>Ezh2</italic> cKO has no apparent effect on proliferating GNPs. If anything, there were increased numbers of GNPs in G1 in <italic>Ezh2</italic> cKO mice compared to WT mice, indicating that GNPs will not cease dividing when H3K27me3 is strongly depleted. Because MB cells are dividing too, Ezh2 inhibition alone will probably not drive a high rate of differentiation.</p>
<p>With regards to forced G0 arrest in MB cells, our observations parallel long term animal experiments, where CDK4/6 inhibitors were used with xenografts of human MB cells. The tumors dramatically regressed when mice were treated with inhibitor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c112">112</xref>), but three-quarters of the tumors recurred within 60 days of drug removal. This suggests that forced exit of the cell cycle is not sufficient to drive terminal differentiation of MB cells. In our experiments, wash-out of Ezh2 and CDK4/6 inhibitors resulted in cell-cycle re-entry of MB cells within 24 hours (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig 8</xref>). When developmental regulation was closely recapitulated using dual inhibitors, driving both exit from the cell cycle and inhibition of Ezh2, we observed significantly higher levels of terminal differentiation without re-entry into the cell cycle following drug wash out.</p>

<title>Barriers to clinical differentiation therapy</title>
<p>Our results suggest two critically important ideas for designing a differentiation therapy for MB. First, our evidence supports the use of Ezh2 inhibition as a strategy for the differentiation of Shh-subgroup medulloblastoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c100">100</xref>). The second is that premature transcriptional de-repression by Ezh2 inhibition is not sufficient to cause differentiation in a dividing MB cell. Prior to larger scale testing in animals, more extensive work needs to be done to optimize the duration of cell cycle arrest. A phase I trial of Palbociclib for pediatric brain tumours was recently completed which showed bone marrow suppression at higher doses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c113">113</xref>). One advantage of differentiation therapy is that the cells may not need to be G0 arrested for more than 72 hours to get induction of differentiation, which means the CDK4/6 inhibitor could be delivered in short pulses. As bone marrow suppression took weeks to months to develop these short pulses will prevent accumulated toxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c114">114</xref>). Continuous administration of an Ezh2 inhibitor would be supplemented with 72 hour cyclic period of CDK4/6 inhibition.</p>

<title>Crosslinking Chromatin immunoprecipiation (ChIP)</title>
<p>The ChIP protocol was adapted from an existing protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c115">115</xref>). Briefly, a single cell suspension of GNPs or MB cells were crosslinked with 1% formaldehyde for 10 min, then quenched with 2.5 M Glycine.

<p>Following sonication the insoluble material was pelleted. Antibodies were added to the sheared chromatin as indicated by <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">table 1</xref> to 750 ul of chromatin and incubated at 4 C overnight. For each ChIP-seq experiment 3 technical replicates of the immunoprecipitation were performed and pooled after DNA isolation. Protein G agarose beads (Roche) were used to precipitate the antibody bound protein and 4 sequential washes were done with the buffers described in the original paper (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c115">115</xref>). Protein was eluted of beads with 10 mM EDTA and 1% SDS and the DNA was liberated from protein using Proteinase K (Roche).

<title>Native ChIP</title>
<p>The crosslinking protocol described above was performed for all antibodies in <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, except the H2Aubi119 antibody where native ChIP was used. The protocol for native ChIP has previously been described (Hasegawa et al., 2016). In brief, cell lysate from fresh frozen GNPs or MB was incubated in MNase for 20 min at 4°C and stopped by adding 1/25 0.5 M EDTA. The amount of MNase used for each reaction was batch adjusted to obtain mono-nucleosomes after a 20 min digestion. After centrifugation at 13000 rpm for 15 min at 4C, the supernatant containing the mononucleosome fraction was collected. Protein was precipitated using Protein G Dynabeads (Invitrogen), with rabbit anti-IgM IgG linker antibodies for the H2Aubi119 ChIP. The beads were washed 3 times using buffers described in Hasegawa et al (2016). DNA was eluted, freed from protein using Proteinase K (Roche), and purified using phenol chloroform extraction. Preparation of ChIP-seq libraries was performed as described for crosslinking ChIP.</p>

<title>ChIP-seq data processing</title>
<p>Reads were adaptor filtered, trimmed, mapped to mm9 using Bowtie2. From the mapped reads duplicates and reads with a mapping quality below 20 were discarded. Quantification of a region around the TSS which were defined in the previous section proceeded with the following steps. Peaks in aligned reads for histone modifications were called using EPIC (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/biocore-ntnu/epic">https://github.com/biocore-ntnu/epic</ext-link><underline>)</underline>, which is a more computationally efficient version of SICER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c116">116</xref>). Macs2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c117">117</xref>) was used to call peaks for the ATAC-seq data as no input sequencing was done. Many of the histone modifications would vary substantially in terms of both the number of reads in a set genomic region but also in terms of the width of the marked area. To capture the variation in with the promoter modifications were quantified, for each of the annotated transcriptional start sites (TSSs) with a window of 250 base pairs flanking the site was quantified and extended to include overlapping peaks. All quantified promoter features underwent a regularized log transform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c118">118</xref>) and were scaled 0 to 1.</p>
<p>For RNAseq and H3K36me3 we altered our quantification strategy. H3K36me3 is a histone modification associated with an elongating RNA polymerase II seem during active expression, which is absent over the promoter. The H3K36me3 ChIP-seq was quantified across the entire gene body and then divided by the length of the gene. The P7 RNAseq data was quantified across all exons and divided by the total length of the exons. Both RNAseq and H3K36me3 were then scaled between 0 and 1.</p>
<p>To calculate the enrichment of chromatin modifications, epigenetic features were separated based upon the distribution of the quantified modifications. The normalized data show a clearly bimodal distribution or a distribution with a large upper tail. Marked or bound versus unmarked or unbound genes could be distinguished by fitting two normal distributions. First long upper tails were removed by calculating the first order derivative of the smoothed ranked data similar to how super enhancers are identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>). We set the threshold for the long upper tails at 0.0004 pragmatically. The remainder of the datapoints for each tracks were split using a mixture of Gaussian distributions using mixtools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c119">119</xref>). Each data set were split into marked/unmarked/tail for the enrichment calculation and for plotting.</p>

<title>Generating cell type-specific transcript models</title>
<p>Since we were attempting to identify epigenetic regulatory features by looking for common signatures present in a large number of genes, it was important that each protein coding gene would be counted roughly equally. Some genes have numerous annotated TSS while others only have one and the discrepancy could bias the downstream analysis. We wanted to represent each protein coding gene with at least one TSS and one transcript model but permitted a gene to have multiple TSS and associated transcript models if there was evidence in the ChIP-seq data of an additional TSS. We used both the Ensembl mouse 67 annotation system as well as the UCSC mm9 knownGene annotation to generate a robust list of baseline TSSs and transcript models. The TSS in the reference annotation was quantified using both the GNP H3K4me3 data and the adult cerebellum H3K4me3 data from the Encode project (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c120">120</xref>).</p>
<p>For genes with clear H3K4me3 binding we selected transcripts with the strongest H3K4me3 at the TSS or within 500 BP of the optimal TSS. For genes without clear H3K4me3 over any transcript we took the maximum of all of the other modifications annotated over potential TSS. To identify the best transcript model for each gene from the numerous in the reference transcriptome we performed de-novo transcript assembly from 1 replicate in each of the time points in the RNA-seq data using Stringtie (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c121">121</xref>). The time point transcript assemblies were then merged using Stringtie merge without the reference annotation. Both selecting a TSS and transcript model using only de novo assembly is complicated by a number of issues. The PolyA selection is 3’ biased, which will bias the de novo transcript models towards TSS which occur in the 3’ direction in a manner that is worse for low expressed genes. We calculated an overlap for each transcript between the reference transcript library (UCSC and ensemble) and the Stringtie models using Bedtools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c122">122</xref>). We then selected a transcript model from the reference with the highest overlap to the Stringtie models for each gene.</p>

<p>The scRNAseq data from the Taylor lab was obtained from GEO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>) and the reads were processed using the DropletUtils package from Bioconductor. We used the annotated cluster to cell tables provided in the supplementary data to reconstruct the data. The granule neuron lineages were separated from other cell types like Purkinje cells, astrocytes. In order to eliminate genes from the bulk RNAseq that were likely arising from non-granule neuron lineage we used the existing cell type clustering analysis done by the Taylor lab using Seurat. The cell types were separated into granule neuron lineage and non GN lineage. For each gene, across the cell types, the highest expression in GN lineage and the non GN lineage cells was calculated. By comparing the maximum GN expression to non GN expression we excluded genes with the following 3 criteria. We excluded genes that were expressed in alternative lineages when not expressed at all in the GN lineage cells, genes that were 2 fold higher in non GN or when they were significantly higher expressed in non GN lineage by the Taylor lab Seurat analysis.</p>

<title>Differentiation gene classification</title>
<p>Expression cutoffs for transcriptional time course data were established using the distribution of the maximal values from the time course. For each dataset the average maximum of the 3 highest expressed timepoints/replicates were taken. Based upon the distribution we created a mixture model to estimate the point at which the probability of the expressed versus unexpressed distribution was equal to .50. For the Scott lab RNAseq dataset the count data was highly zero weighted, so we utilized a mixture of 2 gamma distributions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c124">124</xref>). The Hatten lab TRAP data was modeled using 2 normal distributions. The transcriptional profiles were merged by interpolating the overlapping time points. We then calculated the timepoint that had the maximum and minimum RNA using the combined dataset. Using the maximum and minimum values we calculated a fold change using both datasets. We also estimated the developing time point at which the gene reached 50% of its maximum transcript abundance (t50). In order to be accepted as a significant changer p-values were calculated based upon each dataset individually, using DEseq2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c118">118</xref>) for the RNAseq dataset and limma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c125">125</xref>) for the TRAP data.</p>

<p>To segment the cerebellum into outer EGL, inner EGL, ML, IGL and deep white matter we generated panoramic tiled immunofluorescence images of the P7 cerebellum, with DAPI, NeuN (Alexa 488) and p27 (Alexa 647). The images were then background corrected and stitched in Fiji (Image J) using Grid/Collection with 20% overlap. A custom MATLAB script was then used to perform the segmentation. The first pass performed preprocessing on the image and coarsely identified each layer using a combination or ratio of the individual channels. The IGL was defined as NeuN high, the inner EGL as p27 high, and the outer EGL as DAPI high. Each layer of the cerebellum borders the following layer, allowing previously established layers to serve as guides for the development of following layers. Beginning from the inner most layer, through to the outermost, dilations were used to define and fill out the regions of interest. The pixels of each region were filtered and smoothed to promote clear boundaries between the layers. A composite image was then produced containing all the regions. With each region clearly defined, calculations for segmented pixel area and region measurements for NeuN, P27, and DAPI fluorescence intensity for each layer could be determined.</p>

The individual line segments were then aligned using cross-correlation from the Stats package in R. After alignment the symmetric line segment was split by calculating the local minimum near the center of the dataset for an average p27 intensity of the entire dataset. The center was set to 0 on the x-axis which allowed us to split each line segment into 2 moving from 0 the pial boundary to the IGL at the highest values. There was variability in the distance from the center point to the pial boundary where the EGL starts caused by a gap in the arachnoid along the invagination of the folia. The pial boundary was determined as a drop off in the immunofluorescence background. To find this boundary we identified the peak change in the product of NeuN and p27 values.</p>

<p>Using an unbiased approach, this <bold>important</bold> study discovered a role of Ezh2 in the differentiation of granule neuron precursors, the cell of origin for Shh group of medulloblastoma. Furthermore, the authors also provided <bold>solid</bold> evidence that combined inhibition of Ezh2 and CDK4/6 likely represents a promising strategy for the treatment of this subgroup of MB. Validation of these findings using the FDA-approved Ezh2 inhibitor is needed to further strengthen this preclinical study.</p>

<p>In this manuscript, Purzner and colleagues examine the role of Ezh2 in cerebellar development and tumorigenesis using animal models of SHH medulloblastoma (MB). While Ezh2 plays a relatively minor role in granule neuron development and SHH MB, the authors demonstrate that Ezh2 inhibition, when combined with enforced cell cycle exit, promotes MB cell differentiation and potentially reduces malignancy. Overall, this study is solid and provides valuable insights into Ezh2 regulation in cerebellar development and SHH-MB tumorigenesis.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors investigate the role of Ezh2 in granule neuronal differentiation during cerebellar development and medulloblastoma (MB) progression, integrating multi-omics for a comprehensive epigenetic analysis. The use of Ezh2 conditional knockout (cKO) mice and combination therapy with Ezh2 and CDK4/6 inhibitors shows a promising strategy to induce terminal differentiation in MB cells, with potential therapeutic implications. Additionally, analysis of human SHH-MB samples reveals that higher EZH2 expression correlates with worse survival, indicating the clinical relevance.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The study does not fully explore compensatory mechanisms of PRC2 given that the phenotype of Ezh2 conditional knockout (cKO) in GNP development and MB tumor formation is relatively mild.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This study used an unbiased approach to evaluate epigenetic dynamics during the differentiation of granule neuron precursors, the cell of origin for Shh-MB. These profiling findings led to the focus on H3K27me3 dynamics, which correlate with the remodeling of epigenetic landscape associated with neuronal differentiation gene activation.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Depletion of EZH2, an enzymatic subunit of PRC2, resulted in premature neuronal differentiation in the developing cerebellum.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Little information is shown about the specific genetic programs disrupted by EZH2 depletion. This is a crucial weakness as existing PRC2 inhibitors do not effectively cross the blood-brain barrier. Further studies are necessary to identify downstream targets of PRC2 that could be targeted to induce neuronal differentiation in MB cells.</p>
