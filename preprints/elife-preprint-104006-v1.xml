<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Psilocybin is studied as innovative medication in anxiety, substance abuse and treatment-resistant depression. Animal studies show that psychedelics promote neuronal plasticity by strengthening synaptic responses and protein synthesis. However, the exact molecular and cellular changes induced by psilocybin in the human brain are not known. Here, we treated human cortical neurons derived from induced pluripotent stem cells with the 5-HT2A receptor agonist psilocin - the psychoactive metabolite of psilocybin. We analyzed how exposure to psilocin affects 5-HT2A receptor localization, gene expression, neuronal morphology, synaptic markers and neuronal function. Upon exposure of human neurons to psilocin, we observed a decrease of cell surface-located 5-HT2A receptors first in the axonal-followed by the somatodendritic-compartment. Psilocin further provoked a 5-HT2A-R-mediated augmentation of BDNF abundance. Transcriptomic profiling identified gene expression signatures priming neurons to neuroplasticity. On a morphological level, psilocin induced enhanced neuronal complexity and increased expression of synaptic proteins, in particular in the postsynaptic-compartment. Consistently, we observed an increased excitability and enhanced synaptic network activity in neurons treated with psilocin. In conclusion, exposure of human neurons to psilocin might induces a state of enhanced neuronal plasticity which could explain why psilocin is beneficial in the treatment of neuropsychiatrie disorders where synaptic dysfunctions are discussed.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Since the 90’s the mind-altering psychedelics have become again the subject of an intriguing stream of research in psychiatric disorders<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. Particularly, in times where the development and the approval of new medications is decreasing and the number of patients suffering from psychiatric disorders is rising there is a huge need for new therapeutical interventions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>. Compared to classical drugs the broad therapeutical effect of psychedelics is rapid, robust and can be long-lasting even after single administration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. In particular, the 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 2A (5-HT2A-R) targeting psilocybin, the compound of the so-called “magic mushrooms”, is discussed as fast-acting and long-lasting antidepressant in treatment-resistant depression (TRD), anxiety, obsessive-compulsive disorder and addiction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. Not surprisingly psilocybin is stated as “breakthrough therapy” by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the treatment of depression since 2019. While we know that 5-HT2A-R activation plays a principal role in serotonergic psychedelic-mediated behavioral and cellular response<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup> the molecular and cellular changes induced in the brain - on a single cell and network level are barley understood. The recent demonstration of intracellular 5-HT2A-Rs additionally increased the complexity of psychedelic actions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>. The administration of psychedelics may enable brain network resetting<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup> by generating a plastic cellular state in which synaptic remodeling and augmentation of neuroplasticity-associated proteins and genes are likely<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>. Indeed, biological evidence for the “resetting” hypothesis comes from a pioneering study by Olson and colleagues in 2018 which showed that the treatment with serotonergic psychedelics increases the synthesis of synaptic proteins, strengthens synaptic responses, and fosters neurito- and synaptogenesis in rat cortical neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>. The group therefore introduced the term “psychoplastogen” (greek: psych- (mind), - plast (molded), - gen (producing) for underlining their plasticity-promoting properties. Moreover, serotonergic psychedelics already have been shown to promote the 5-HT2A-R-mediated growth of dendritic spines and modulate neurotransmission<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>. As molecular and cellular psychedelic research is recently based nearly exclusively on animal studies, the question emerged whether those insights can be translated to the human brain. Psychiatric disorders and psychedelic effects are complex, multisymptomatic and therefore often difficult to study in non-human model organisms. Most importantly, drugs that are efficiently tested in psychiatric animal models might not be necessarily transferable to the human system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>. In that context, induced human pluripotent stem cells (IPSC) have emerged as a powerful tool to generate neurons and neuronal circuitries, model brain disorders and identity the molecular mechanisms of drug interventions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Here, we explored the molecular, transcriptional, morphometric and functional consequences of the psychoactive 5-HT2A receptor agonist psilocin, the active metabolite of psilocybin in human iPSC-derived cortical neurons. We demonstrate that psilocin leads to a set of molecular, morphological and functional changes that start shortly after administration and manifest in time. These include an increase in brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression and an activation of gene expression programs associated with neuromodulation and plasticity resulting in increased neuronal complexity, synaptogenesis and changes in neuronal network function. Thus, our study provides first evidence that the 5TH2A receptor agonist psilocybin activates widespread neuroplastic programs in human neurons.</p>

<title>Psilocin causes 5-HT2A receptor internalization and redistribution in human cortical neurons</title>
<p>As an experimental model to study the effects of psilocin in human neurons and neuronal networks we differentiated human iPSCs (expressing the pluripotency-associated transcription factors 0CT4 and S0X2) into neural progenitor cells which we further differentiated into neurons of mainly dorsal forebrain identity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. S1A-B</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>. Neural progenitor cells express typical neural stem <italic>I</italic> progenitor cell markers such as NESTIN or S0X2 as well as the dorsal forebrain-associated transcription factors PAX6 and are negative for F0XA2, as floorplate/ midbrain marker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. S1B</xref>). Neurons differentiated from these progenitors for &gt;5 weeks express the neuronal antigen NeuN, the dendritic marker MAP2, and the axonal marker TAU. Most neurons express TBR1 and <italic>I</italic> or CTIP2, transcription factors typically found in Layer 5/6 neurons of the human cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1A</xref>). Neuronal activity in mature neurons is indicated by expression of the activity-dependent immediate early gene cFOS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1A</xref>). Astrocytes expressing glial fibrillary acid protein (GFAP) were found occasionally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1A</xref>). These represent the only contamination in the otherwise purely neuronal culture, which contains no residual progenitors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. S1C</xref>). 5-HT2A-R expression was confirmed by PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. S1D</xref>) and by immunocytochemistry targeting an extracellular epitope which showed presentation of the receptor in the somatodendritic and axonal compartment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1B</xref>, upper row). 5-HT2A-R agonists such as psilocin are hypothesized to cause immediate (within minutes) internalization of the 5-HT2A-R <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> and are described to cause desensitization by reduced receptor abundance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>. We thus analyzed the effects of psilocin on the 5-HT2A-R in human neurons 10 minutes (min) and 24 hours (hrs) following exposure to psilocin. By 10 min, 5-HT2A-R expression at the neuronal surface significantly decreased in the axonal compartment (Tau-positive; from MCtrl = 0.4 ± 0.3; M10min = 0.3 ± 0.3), but not in the somatodendritic compartment (MAP2-positive; measured as 5-HT2A-R particles per μm; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1B-C, F</xref>).</p>

<caption><title>Validation of mature cortical neuron properties and effect of psilocin on cell surface-located 5-HT2A receptor presentation.</title>
    <p>(A) hiPSCs were differentiated <italic>in-vitro</italic> into glutamatergic cortical neurons over a neuronal progenitor step since the cerebral cortex is a key region for psychedelic effects and psychiatric disorders. Mature 40-day old cortical neurons were glutamatergic (vGLUT2 expression) and expressed cortical layer markers like TBR1, CTIP2 and the neuronal markers NeuN, MAP2 and TAU. cFOS expression is a sign for neuronal activity. GFAP expression indicated a low amount of astrocytes. Scale bar: 50 μm, for GFAP staining 100 μm. (B) Cortical neurons expressed the cell surface-located 5-HT2A receptor (ex5-HT2A-R) validated by immunofluorescence. (B – C) Representative ex5-HT2A-R staining showed decrease in TAU<sup>+</sup> axonal receptor presentation 10 minutes after 10 μM psilocin trigger (10 min Psi) compared to the untreated condition (Ctrl), that may indicate receptor complex formation or internalization. (B) Scale bar: 50 μm (C), close up scale bar: 10 μm. (D) Representative ex5-HT2A-R staining. After 24 hrs, both the axonal and dendritic receptor density was significantly decreased, speaking for a subacute down-regulation of the receptor, scale bar: 50 μm (E) close up scale bar: 5 μm. (F) Decrease in TALT axonal receptor localization 10 minutes after 10 μM psilocin trigger compared to the control condition was significant. After 24 hrs, both the axonal and dendritic receptor density was significantly decreased, speaking for a down-regulation of the receptor. For Ctrl <italic>N</italic> = 180 neurites, for 10 min <italic>N</italic> = 180 neurites, for 24 hrs <italic>N</italic> = 135 – 140 neurites were calculated. Two control cell lines each with two biological batches for MAP2<sup>+</sup> and TAU<sup>+</sup> ex5-HT2A-R were included (except of 24hrs for Ctrl 3 with one biological batch). Kruskal-Wallis-Test for independent samples was calculated. Significance levels against the respective control and for multiple group comparisons.

<p>The decrease in cell surface-located receptor signals was largely prevented by inhibiting clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) using dynamin inhibitor dynasore, indicating that this acute down regulation is at least in part mediated by receptor internalization. Dynasore-mediated internalization of 5-HT2A-R resulted in accumulation of receptor-dependent fluorescence signals in roundish aggregates along the axonal compartment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. S1E-F</xref>). At 24 hrs, both, receptor densities on axons (from MCtrl = 0.4 ± 0.3; M24hrs = 0.1 ± 0.2) and dendrites (from MCtrl = 0.6 ± 0.4; M24hrs = 0.2 ± 0.2) were significantly decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1D-E, F</xref>), suggesting a subacute downregulation and/or internalization of the receptor also in the somatodendritic compartment. Thus, psilocin treatment induces a two-phasic decrease of cell-surface located 5-HTR2A-R abundance, first in axons and then in the somatodendritic compartment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1G</xref>).</p>

<sec id="s2-2">
<title>Psilocin induces BDNF expression and downstream signaling in human neurons</title>
<p>Psychedelics have been shown to efficiently increase levels of neurotrophic factors, such as BDNF<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>. We thus addressed BDNF expression in human neurons following exposure to psilocin. We analyzed the effect of different psilocin concentrations (ranging from 10 nM to 10μM) exposed for 10 min and also at 24 hrs following exposure. We observed a dosage-dependent increase in the abundance of BDNF-positive particles (quantified as particles per μm neurite length) which reached significance at a concentration of 10 μM psilocin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. S2A-B</xref>). A longer treatment (6 hrs instead of 10 min) with a lower concentration (100 nM instead of 10 μM) of psilocin also induced BDNF abundance significantly, but less strikingly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. S2C-D</xref>). We thus continued to use 10 μM psilocin in the following experiments. The clear induction of BDNF particle density was reproduced in four biological independent control cell lines and several differentiation batches for each line (from MCtrl = 1.5 ± 1.2; MPsi = 2.6 ± 1.9) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2A-C</xref>). When comparing BDNF densities independently in dendrites (MAP2-positive) and axons (Tau-positive), the significant increase in BDNF could be assigned to both neuronal compartments to a comparable extent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. S2E-F</xref>). Also, at 48 hrs following the exposure to psilocin, a significant increase of BDNF particles was observed compared to the untreated condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. S2G</xref>). The increase in BDNF abundance was 5-HT2A-R-mediated as treatment of the neurons with the specific 5-HTR2A-R antagonist ketanserin prevented BDNF upregulation by psilocin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2D-E</xref>) (from MCtrl = 2.5 ± 1.4; MPsi = 4 ± 2.3; MPsi + Ket = 2.1 ±1.4; MKet = 1.4 ± 1.2). Upregulation of BDNF could also be prevented by blocking CME with dynasore or protein kinase C (PKC) with the PKC inhibitor chelerythrine, indicating that CME and PKC activation are critically involved in this process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2F-G</xref>) (from MCtrl= 3.1 ± 1.5 to MPsi = 4.6 ± 2.4; MPsi + Chel = 3 ± 1.7; MPsi + D = 3.4 ± 1). Upregulation of BDNF was also validated by Western immunoblot where we observed an increase in the levels of pro-BDNF and were able to detect mature BDNF at approximately 14 kDa, which, under baseline conditions, was below the detection level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. S2H</xref>). Increased BDNF signaling in psilocin-treated neurons is indicated by an increase in the phosphorylation of the BDNF receptor TrkB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. S2H</xref>). Furthermore, as a downstream target of BDNF signaling we observed an increase of the phosphorylation of AKT at Ser 473 1 day (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. S2I</xref>) and 3 days after psilocin exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2H-I</xref>) which was reversed by ketanserin treatment (from MCtrl = 0.8 ± 0.2; MPsi = 1.3 ± 0.2; MKet = 0.9 ± 0.2).</p>

<title>Psilocin induces gene expression changes associated with axonal and synaptic plasticity</title>
<p>To analyze the influence of psilocin on global gene expression in cortical neurons, we performed whole transcriptome sequencing one day and three days following a single 10 min administration with 10 μM psilocin in neurons from two independent genetic backgrounds. GO enrichment and KEGG pathway analysis comparing cells one day and three days after psilocin administration with the respective controls revealed an enrichment of significantly affected genes in many ontologies and pathways associated with axonal growth and synaptic remodeling, plasticity and learning, memory and cognition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">S3A</xref>). Most significant changes occurred within the first 24 hrs which is reflected when plotting the significantly changed genes only for selected GO term enriched at both time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">S3B</xref>). When looking at a more global gene expression level of all genes included in the respective GOs, gene expression of GOs associated with axonal outgrowth show a generally higher expression at day 1 which is further increased at day 3. In contrast genes associated to synaptic organization, plasticity and learning, memory and cognition show a trend towards decreased expression at day 1 and a generally stronger increase at day 3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">S3C</xref>). The overlapping assignment of significant differentially expressed genes to the aforementioned GOs underlines their importance in long-term plasticity (e.g., <italic>CDK5, CAMK),</italic> synapse formation (e.g., <italic>SYN1)</italic> and axonal and neurite growth (e.g., <italic>GAP43)</italic> and neuronal structure marker (e.g., <italic>MAPT)</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3D</xref>). The latter constent with increasing staining intensity for TAU (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2</xref>).

<p>We observed an increase of primary neurites at 25 μm (significant at 48 hrs and a trend at 24 hrs from MCtrl = 4.1 ± 2.1; M24hrs = 5.4 ± 3.7; M48hrs = 5.5 ± 2.4) and of intersections at 50 μm (significantly increased at 24 and 48 hrs post treatment from MCtrl = 2.7 ± 1.4; M24hrs = 4 ± 2.3 to M48hrs = 3.9 ± 1.8; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4B</xref>).

<title>Psilocin increases synaptic strength and synaptogenesis</title>
<p>To address changes on neuronal function, we exposed neuronal cultures 10 min or 24 h to 10 μM psilocin and performed whole-cell patch-clamp experiments one week later. Following the 10 min exposure, we observed a increasing trend in the number of evoked action potentials (APs), having amplitudes of around 100 mV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5A</xref>). Extended exposure of the cultures to psilocin (24h) increased this effect reaching significance (total number of APs from MCtrl = 20.1 ± 12; MPsi 10min; day 7 = 28.9 ± 16.9; MPsi 24hrs; day 7 = 30 ± 14.5; AP amplitude from MCtrl = 101.1 ± 13.3; MPsi 10min; day 7 = 101.1 ± 13.2; MPsi 24hrs; day 7 = 101.3 ± 16.7). To find out whether the increase in AP firing enhanced synaptic network activity, we recorded spontaneous AP-dependent excitatory postsynaptic currents (sEPSCs). Indeed, the frequency of sEPSCs increased in both psilocin-treated conditions to some extent (MCtrl = 0.6 ± 0.7; MPsi 10min; day 7 = 1.0 ± 1.3; MPsi 24hrs; day 7 = 1.1 ±1.2; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5B</xref>). And, we observed a slight increase in sEPSC amplitude (MCtrl = 14.2 ± 4.7; MPsi 10min; day 7 = 16.7 ± 5.1; MPsi 24hrs; day 7 = 15.5 ± 5.3; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5B</xref>), consistent with the observed <italic>GRIA</italic> upregulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3E</xref>). The latter amplitude increase was next examined on AP-independent miniature EPSCs (mEPSCs) which are generally caused by the spontaneous release of single vesicles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figs. 5C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">S4A</xref>). The amplitudes of mEPSCs increased 7 days after the start of 24 hrs psilocin administration consistently for two cell lines (MCtrl = 11.1 ± 2.2; MPsi 24hrs; day 7 = 12.8 ± 4.2, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5C</xref>; MCtrl = 9.3 ± 2.8; MPsi 24hrs; day 7 = 11.2 ± 3.7, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Fig. S4A</xref>), whereas the frequencies of the mEPSCs were rather stable (MCtrl = 0.8 ± 0.5; MPsi 24hrs; day 7 = 0.9 ± 0.6, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5C</xref>; MCtrl = 0.9 ± 0.7; MPsi 24hrs; day 7 = 0.7 ± 0.5, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Fig. S4A</xref>). When examining mEPSCs from separately differentiated neurons exposed to psilocin for 24 hrs and analyzed at day 11, the increase in mEPSC amplitude was somewhat attenuated compared with 7 days (MCtrl = 11.7 ± 4.3; MPsi 24hrs; day 11 = 12.4 ± 3.6; frequency from MCtrl = 0.8 ± 0.8; MPsi 24hrs; day 11 =0.5 ± 0.3, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5C</xref>).

We therefore hypothesized that extended psilocin administration fosters synaptic network activity and synaptogenesis and thus examined effects of a 96 hrs exposure. In line with the above-mentioned hypothesis, the amplitudes of the sEPSCs increased significantly in two lines (MCtrl = 22.5 ± 6.5; MPsi 96hrs; day 10 = 30.7 ± 4.8, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5D</xref>; MCtrl = 15.9 ± 4.5 ; MPsi 96hrs; day 10 = 27.6 ± 10, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Fig. S4B</xref>), and the frequencies showed a trend to increase similar to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5B</xref>, reflecting enhanced network activity (MCtrl = 1.0 ± 1.0; MPsi 96hrs; day 10 = 1.5 ± 1.0, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5E</xref>; MCtrl = 1.5 ± 1.7; MPsi 96hrs; day 10 = 1.0 ± 0.7, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Fig. S4B</xref>).</p>

<p>This enhanced synaptic network activity should affect the abundance of either the presynaptic marker synapsin and/or the postsynaptic marker PSD-95 and may even affect their co-localization at day 4 and at day 10 following 4 day permanent 10 μM psilocin administration. In line with above electrophysiological results for the 10 day psilocin exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5D</xref>) and the gene expression data, which indicated changes associated with synaptogenesis and synaptic plasticity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3</xref>) we observed for the pre-synaptic marker synapsin, a trend towards an increase of the density (particles per neurite length) (from MCtrl = 0.25 ± 0.2; M4days = 0.28 ± 0.2; MIOdays = 0.29 ± 0.2) and intensity (mean fluorescence intensity of the particles) (from MCtrl = 21 ± 13.3; M4days = 24.1± 15; MIOdays = 19.8 ±10.9) at both time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5E-H</xref>). In line with the gene expression data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3A</xref>, postsynaptic density), we observed a significant increase in the density of the postsynaptic marker PSD-95 (from MCtrl = 1.1 ± 0.5; M4days = 1.4 ± 0.6; MIOdays = 1.3 ± 0.5) and in its intensity (from MCtrl = 31.8 ± 12,9; M4days = 36.8 ± 15.6; MIOdays = 38 ± 16.4) for both time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5I-J</xref>).

Together, these experiments indicate that psilocin augments synaptic strength primarily via an increase in the postsynaptic receptor density, which lasts at least for 6 days from the start of psilocin withdrawal and that extended exposure of neurons to psilocin pronounces the effects on synaptic strength.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The neuroplasticity-promoting psychoplastogen<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup> psilocybin is currently developed as a new medication in the treatment of psychiatric disorders<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>. “Brain network resetting”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup> by psilocybin , i.e. the restoration of neuronal and synaptic dysfunction associated with the pathophysiology of mental disorders<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup>, could be achieved by stimulating signaling pathways associated with neuroplasticity and BDNF signaling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>. So far, experimental evidence for this hypothesis is based on data from non-human model organisms. In our experimental setting, human neurons exposed to psilocin present with a biphasic downregulation of cell surface-located 5-HT2A-Rs, which starts in the axonal compartment and expands to the dendritic compartment. Stimulation of 5-HT2A-Rs can lead to different adaptive processes including internalization, downregulation and recycling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>. Interestingly, pychedelics have been already shown to reduce 5-HT2A-R density in animal models<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup> We see a decrease in receptor surface density, prevented by inhibiting the GTPase dynamin arguing that clathrin-mediated endocytosis is involved in this process, which suggests internalization of cell surface-located 5-HT2A-R. Given the potential of psychedelics to diffuse across cell membranes and to activate intracellular pathways<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>, enhanced internalization of 5-HT2A-R may result in stronger intracellular signaling processes caused by the combination of retrograde trafficking and the activation of internally residing receptors adding both to serotonin-independent and psychedelic-dependent signaling strength<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>We also observed a pronounced psilocin-induced BDNF upregulation in human cortical neurons and show that PKC activation and endocytosis, two mechanisms contributing to 5-HT2A-R internalization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup>, are involved as chelerythrine and dynasore inhibited BDNF augmentation. BDNF plays an important role in neurogenesis, synaptogenesis, and the formation of synaptic interactions. Particularly the mature BDNF/phosphorylated-TrkB receptor complex is involved in multiple pathways linked to prosurvival and synaptic plasticity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup>. Recently it was shown that psychedelics also directly bind to the BDNF TrKB receptor, thereby affecting TrkB dimerization and facilitating the effect of endogenous BDNF, which underlines the importance of the BDNF system for the action of psychedelics<sup>72</sup>. In keeping with this, we show that psilocin leads to a fast and enduring upregulation of proteins and genes linked to neuronal complexity, synaptogenesis and synaptic transmission, as also demonstrated in psychedelic-mediated plasticity in animal studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup>. Of note, BDNF upregulation and changes in gene expression where reversed by ketanserin confirming that these effects are medated by 5-HT2A-Rs.</p>
<p>In our model, augmentation of neuronal complexity is an outcome which can be detected as early as 24 hrs after psilocin administration. In rodents, serotonergic psychedelics also foster synaptogenesis and spinogenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup>. In line with this we show that psilocin also promotes synaptogenesis, measured by the increase in PSD-95, synapsin and their colocalization. As a result, we observe changes in intrinsic neuronal properties and network function. More specifically, we see an increased excitability and an increase in postsynaptic current frequency but in particular amplitude. The higher number of action potentials generated by current injections could be due to increased dendritic excitability as reviewed by Kwan and colleagues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>. The increase in synaptic strength lasted at least 6 days and is in agreement with frequency and amplitude increases of miniature and spontaneous synaptic currents observed in acute brain slices of mice after administering psilocybin or DMT <italic>in</italic> v/vo<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>. These drugs may increase extracellular glutamate levels, similar to ketamine, LSD and DOI administration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref></sup>. To close the circle, 5-HT2A-R stimulation, subsequent glutamate release and AMPA receptor activation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup> activates the BDNF-associated TrkB and mTORCI pathway which promotes BDNF expression itself<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref></sup>. Of note, PSD-95, the postsynaptic marker that we found to be upregulated, controls activity-dependent AMPA receptor incorporation in the postsynapse<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref></sup> which can modify the strength of excitatory synaptic transmission<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Finally, an enrichment of differentially expressed genes associated with GO terms of learning, memory and cognition suggest behavioral long-term effects of the drug which are based on the above mentioned structural and functional modifications. The effects were dependent on the duration of drug exposure suggesting that repetitive administration of psilocybin might elicit beneficial effect with respect to brain plasticity.</p>
<p>Together, our work confirms the postulation by the Olson group that psychedelics may act through an evolutionary conserved mechanism as we can replicate the results from animal studies in our human system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>. Moreover, our study highlights the importance of a human model system for understanding the mode of action of psychedelics and potentially for disease modelling.</p>

<p>After a first washing with PBS, cells were fixed in 4% PFA (Sigma-Aldrich), washed three times with PBS and blocked and/or permeabilized in blocking solution containing 10% FBS (Thermo Fisher Scientific) in PBS. Blocking was performed for one h. Dilution of primary and secondary antibodies were performed in blocking solution. Please refer to <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table S1</xref> for blocking/ permeabilization solution and dilution of primary antibodies. Primary antibodies were incubated over night at 4°C. Samples were washed three times with corresponding blocking solution.

Counterstaining of cell nuclei was carried out by using 300 nM DAPI (Biolegend, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table S3</xref>), incubated for 5 min at room temperature and washed three times in PBS and once with ddhteO. Slides were mounted with mounting solution (100 mM Tris-HCI (pH 8.5), 25% glycerol, 10% mowiol (Carl Roth), 0.6% DABCO® (Carl Roth) on glass coverslip and air-dried overnight. Cells were observed with the Inverted Leica DMIL LED Microscope. Stem cell and neural progenitor properties were imaged with the Leica DM6 B microscope with Thunder imaging software. For neuroplasticity experiments Leica confocal TCS SP5 II microscope was used. Brightfield images were made with Fluorescence Microscope Celldiscoverer 7 microscope from Zeiss. For analysis of immunofluorescence a polygon selection of ROIs was chosen. The protein density and co-localization of particles was measured with the ComDet v.0.5.3 plug-in for Imaged (National Institutes of Health (NIH), open source). A particle size (depending on experimenters’ evaluation), constant for overall experiments (5-HTR2A: 1.0; BDNF: 1.0; PSD-95: 3.0; Synapsin: 3.0) and an intensity threshold (in SD), adjusted within each experiment, was defined. For co-localization analysis the channels of proteins that have to be co-localized were merged in advance. As maximal distance between co-localized spots 4.00 pixels were stated. The number of particles was divided by the total length of the neurite in μm measured with the straight-line tool spanning the polygonal ROL Multiple ROIs were set per image. <italic>N</italic> = 1 corresponds to one neurite segment detected by one ROL</p>

For protein isolation, cells were resuspended in 150 μl of protein lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCL (pH 7.4), 150 mM NaCI, 25 mM EDTA, 1% (v/v) SDS with one protease and one phosphatase inhibitor mini tablet (Thermo Fisher Scientific) per 10 ml of protein solution) and incubated for 10 min at room temperature and then incubated 1 h on ice. To shear gDNA and reduce viscosity samples were sonicated (20% duty cycles, 50% output, five pulses) from a Branson Ultrasonics™ sonifier 250 (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Samples were centrifuged for 5 min for 5000 g at 4°C. Supernatant was transferred to a new tube. Protein concentration was measured with the BCA protein assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Samples were diluted 1:5 in ddHzO and the absorption at 562 nm was measured in a PowerWave™ XS microplate reader (BioTek). The protein concentration of samples was calculated based on the included BSA standard dilution series.</p>

<p>15 – 30 μg of protein was mixed with 6x denaturing protein sample buffer (93.75 mM Tris-HCL (pH 6.8), 6% SDS, 6% Glycerol, 9% 2-Mercaptoethanol, 0.25% Bromophenol blue) and boiled for 5 min at 95 °C. For the separation of proteins an SDS-PAGE (Bio-Rad Laboratories) was performed in a Mini-PROTEAN 2-D electrophoresis cell chamber and with the PowerPac™ Basic Power Supply. First, the polyacrylamide gel (Gel buffer for polyacrylamide gels, SDS-PAGE: 3M Tris-HCI (pH 8.5), 0.3% (w/v) SDS; SDS-Polyacrylamide, stacking gel: 24.8% (v/v) Gel buffer, SDS-PAGE, 3.84% (v/v) Bis/ acrylamide, 0.00672% (w/v) APS, 0.224% TEMED; SDS-Polyacrylamide, separating gel: 33.3% (v/v) Gel buffer, SDS-PAGE, 10% (v/v) Bis/ acrylamide, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 0.028% (w/v) APS, 0.09% (v/v) TEMED) runs for about 30 min with 30 V for stacking of proteins and then for about 1.5 – 2 hrs at 110 V. A semi-dry blotting was performed using the Trans-Blot Turbo™ transfer system (Bio-Rad Laboratories) performed with 20 V and 1 A for 30 – 60 min. A reference protein marker (PS10 plus, GeneON Bioscience) was included to determine the size of the protein bands. For blotting 0.45 μm pore size nitrocellulose blotting membrane (Sigma-Aldrich) was used. The membrane was surrounded from both sides by 6 layers of WB filter tissue (VWR). Filter tissue and membrane were wetted in transfer buffer (10% (v/v) Tris-glycine buffer, 20% (v/v) methanol, 0.08% (v/v) SDS). Membranes were blocked for 60 min in 5% BSA (Sigma-Aldrich) in TBS-T (10% (v/v) of TBS with 248 mM Tris-HCI (pH 7.4), 1.37 M NaCI, 26.8 mM KCI plus 0.1% (v/v) Tween®20 (Sigma-Aldrich)) in a 50 ml tube. Primary antibodies (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl4">Table S4</xref>) were diluted in 5% BSA in TBS-T and were incubated over night at 4°C or for 1 h at room temperature on a rolling mixer. The membrane was washed three times in TBS-T for 10 min at room temperature on the next day. 1:15,000 infrared DyLight™ IR-conjugated secondary antibodies (Cell Signaling Technologies, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl5">Table S5</xref>) in TBS-T were applied for 1 h at room temperature. Washing in TBS-T was carried out three times and once in TBS for 10 min at room temperature. Visualisation of tagged proteins was carried out with Odyssey IR WB imaging system (Li-COR). Signals were normalized by 1: 20,000 P-actin levels. Antibodies for Western blotting are listed in Supplementary <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table S2</xref>.

The neurons were identified with a Zeiss Axioskop using infrared differential interference contrast video microscopy in the recording chamber. Neurons were perfused at 2 ml/min (peristaltic pump; Ismatec GmbH) with carbogen (95% O2; 5% CO2)-saturated artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) containing 125 mM NaCI, 1 mM MgCb, 2 mM CaCb, 2.5 mM KOI, 10 mM D-glucose, 25 mM NaHCOs, 1.25 mM NaH2PO4 (pH 7.3, osmolarity 300 mOsm). Pipettes were pulled from borosilicate glass capillaries (GB150F-8P, 1.5 mm o.d., 0.86 i.d.; Science Products GmbH) with a P-97 micropipette puller (Sutter Instrument). Pipettes had resistances between 4-6 MD when filled with intracellular solution containing 115 mM K-gluconate (or cesium-gluconate), 20 mM KOI, 10 mM Na-phosphocreatine, 4 mM Mg-ATP, 0.3 mM GTP, 0.2 mM ethylene glycol tetraacetic acid (EGTA) and 10 mM HEPES (pH 7.3, osmolarity 300 mOsm). In voltage-clamp, input resistance was determined at -70 mV based on currents evoked by small voltage steps (-3 mV; 300 ms). In current-clamp, the resting membrane potential (RMP) was determined and APs were evoked with increasing current injections (10 μA; 300 ms). The amplitude of the first evoked AP was analyzed, and the number of all APs evoked by 10 depolarizing steps was summed up. sEPSCs were recorded at -70 mV with K (Fig, 7B)- or Cs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7D</xref> and Fig. S7B) -based intracellular solution.

<caption><title>Validation of iPSC and neural progenitor properties and ex5-HT2A-R expression.</title>
    <p>(A) Timeline: hiPSCs were differentiated <italic>in-vitro</italic> into glutamatergic cortical neurons over a neuronal progenitor step. Maturation of cortical neurons took about 6 weeks. Scheme generated with <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://biorender.com/v84c084">BioRender.com</ext-link>. (B) iPSCs expressed pluripotent marker S0X2 and 0CT4. Neuronal progenitors expressed S0X2, PAX6 and NESTIN and were negative for F0XA2 as a midbrain marker. Scale bar: 50 μm. (C) RT-PCR analysis revealed expression of neuronal subtype markers, neurotransmitter receptors, neuronal activity markers, neuronal markers and synapse-associated genes. (D) RT-PCR of the <italic>HTR2A</italic> gene (also expressed in commercialized samples of fetal and adult brain) confirmed expression of 5-HT2A-R. (E-F) The decrease in ex5HT2A-R expression was prevented by inhibiting CME with dynasore co-treatment and monotreatment (“Psi + D” and “D”) showing in the close-up (E) axonal ex5-HT2A-R accumulation in aggregates, scale bar: 50 μm, close up-scale bar: 5 μm.</p></caption>

<p>(A)Representative image of a neuronal network for pre-treatment condition (DMSO) and 24 hrs after a 10 min 10 nM, 100 nM, 1 μM or 10 μM trigger showed the strongest increase in BDNF density for the 10 μM treatment condition. Scale bar: 50 μm. (B) BDNF density was exclusively significantly increased 24 hrs after 10 min 10 μM Psilocin trigger (10 μM). Ctrl cell line 1 was included in the analysis, with one biological batch. (Ctrl with <italic>N</italic> = 76 neurites; 24 hrs after a 10 min 10 nM <italic>(N</italic> = 75 neurites), respectively 100 nM <italic>(N = 75</italic> neurites), respectively 1 μM <italic>(N = 75</italic> neurites), respectively 10 μM (A/= 75 neurites). (C) Representative image of a neuronal network 24 hrs after an “artificial” (10 min 10 μM) and a “physiological” (6 hrs 100nM) treatment condition. Scale bar: 50 μm. (D) BDNF density was significantly increased 24 hrs after a 10 min 10 μM psilocin trigger (10 min 10 μM) and 24 hrs after a 6 hrs 100 nM psilocin stimulation (6 hrs 100 nM). BDNF density was also significantly increased for the” artificial” compared to the “physiological” stimulation. Two Ctrl cell lines were included in the analysis, each with one biological batch.

(E) Representative image of a neuronal network of the Ctrl condition and 24 hrs after a 10 min 10 μM psilocin trigger showed an increase in axonal TALT and dendritic MAP2<sup>+</sup> BDNF density. Scale bar: 50 μm. (F) BDNF density was significantly increased for axonal TAU<sup>+</sup> and dendritic MAP2<sup>+</sup> BDNF density for the psilocin condition. One cell line (Ctrl 3) was included in the analysis, with two biological batches. (Ctrl with <italic>N</italic> = 90 neurites; Psi with <italic>N</italic> = 90 neurites). (G) BDNF density was significantly increased 24 and still 48 hrs (24 hrs; 48 hrs) after a 10 min 10 μM psilocin trigger.

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This study reports the effects of psilocin on iPSC-derived human cortical neurons.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The characterization was comprehensive, involving immunohistochemistry of various markers, 5-HT2A receptors, BDNF, and TrkB, transcriptomics analyses, morphological determination, electrophysiology, and finally synaptic protein measurements. The results are in close agreement with prior work (PMID 29898390) on rat-cultured cortical neurons. Nevertheless, there is value in confirming those earlier findings and furthermore demonstrating the effects in human neurons, which are important for translation. The genetic, proteomics, and cell structure analyses used in this paper are its major strengths. The study supports the value of using iPSC-derived human cortical neurons for drug development involving psychedelics-related compounds.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) Line 140: 5-HT2A receptor expression was found via immunocytochemistry to reside in the somatodendritic and axonal compartments. However, prior work from ex vivo tissue using electron microscopy has found predominantly 5-HT2A receptor expression in the somatodendritic compartment (PMID: 12535944). Was this antibody validated to be 5-HT2A receptor-specific? Can the authors reason why the discrepancy may arise, and if the axonal expression is specific to the cultured neurons?</p>
<p>(2) Line 143: It would be helpful to specify the dose of psilocin tested, and describe how this dose was chosen.</p>
<p>(3) Figure 1: The interpretation is that the differential internalization in the axonal and somatodendritic compartments is time-dependent. However, given that only one dose is tested, it is also possible that this reflects dose dependence, with the longer time exposure leading to higher dose exposure, so these variables are related. That is, if a higher dose is given, internalization may also be observed after 10 minutes in the dendritic compartment.</p>
<p>(4) Figure 3 &amp; 4: What is the 'control' here? A more appropriate control for the 24 hours after psilocin application would be 24 hours after vehicle application. Here the authors are looking at before and after, but the factor of time elapsed and perturbation via application is not controlled for.</p>
<p>(5) The sample size was not clearly described. In the figure legend, N = the number of neurites is provided, but it is unclear how many cells have been analyzed, and then how many of those cells belong to the same culture. These are important sample size information that should be provided. Relatedly, statistical analyses should consider that the neurites from the same cells are not independent. If the neurites indeed come from the same cells, then the sample size is much smaller and a statistical analysis considering the nested nature of the data should be used.</p>

<p>In this article, Schmidt et al use iPSC-derived human cortical neurons to test the effects the psychedelic psilocin in different models of neuroplasticity.</p>
<p>Using human iPSC-derived cortical neurons, the authors test the expression of 5-HT2A and subcellular distribution, as well as the effect of different times of exposure to psilocin on 5-HT2A expression. The authors evaluated the effect of the 5-HT2 antagonist ketanserin, as well as the inhibition of dynamin-dependent endocytic pathways with dynasore. Gene expression and plasticity (structural and functional) was also evaluated after different times of exposure to psilocin.</p>
<p>In general, results are interesting since they use the iPSC to evaluate the potentially translationally relevant effects of psilocin (the active metabolite of the psychedelic psilocybin). However, there are a few concerns that need to be addressed:</p>
<p>(1) My main critique is the lack of experimental validation of selectivity and/or specificity of the anti-5-HT2A antibody targeting the extracellular loop of the 5-HT2A receptor (Alomone labs, cat # ASR-033). Most of the primary antibodies targeting class A GPCRs (including the 5-HT2A receptor) have very limited selectivity. Without validation (using for example knockdown techniques to decrease expression of 5-HT2A in their iPSC-derived human cortical neurons), the experiments using this antibody should be excluded from the manuscript.</p>
<p>(2) Did the author evaluate whether 5-HT is present in the cell media? If it is, this may affect the functional outcomes evaluated throughout, since as the endogenous ligand it would in principle activate the 5-HT2A receptor.</p>
<p>(3) Some of the datasets are not statistically analyzed (or quantified), such as Figure S1F.</p>
<p>(4) Another important concern is the experimental design used to evaluate the effect of psilocin at different time points (24h, 4 days and 10 days). One of the unique and translationally interesting effects of psychedelics including psilocybin is that the in vivo plasticity-related effects (increased structural or synaptic plasticity for example) are observed post-acutely, or once the active compound psilocin is fully metabolized, or not present in the CNS directly targeting the 5-HT2A. Using the iPSC, it seems that the authors continuously exposed cells to psilocin (for hours or even days) at least for some of the experimental techniques. Since this is not the model of what occurs using an in vivo model (such as a single dose of psilocybin to mice, collecting frontal cortex samples 24-h after drug administration, once the active compound is fully metabolized), the authors' findings lack translational validity. Can the authors comment on this?</p>
<p>(5) In Figure 2E, it seems that ketamine by itself is reducing BDNF density. How then the authors conclude that ketamine blocks psi-induced effects? Using a more selective 5-HT2A antagonist such as M100907 could also improve the outcome (in terms of selectivity) of this experiment.</p>
<p>(6) To evaluate neurite complexity, the authors used the AAV-CamKII-mCherry viral vector, but mCherry (Fig 4A) seems to be retained in the nucleus.</p>
<p>(7) Minor: Reference 36- this is a review article that does not mention the psychedelic psilocin</p>

<p>We sincerely thank the reviewers for their thorough and constructive evaluation of our manuscript. We particularly appreciate their recognition of our comprehensive characterization approach, which integrates immunohistochemistry, transcriptomics, morphological assessments, and electrophysiology to understand psilocin's effects on human neurons. The reviewers highlighted that our findings closely align with and validate prior work on rat cortical neurons, while importantly extending these insights to human cells. We are encouraged by their acknowledgment that our study demonstrates the value of using iPSC-derived human cortical neurons for testing potentially translatable effects of psychedelic compounds. Their positive assessment of our work's implications for psychedelic drug development is particularly valuable, as it supports our goal of advancing the understanding of these compounds' therapeutic potential and their possible application in treating neuropsychiatric disorders.</p>
<p>We are also very grateful for the reviewers' constructive criticism which will help strengthen our manuscript significantly. Based on their detailed feedback, we plan to perform several additional experiments for inclusion in the revised manuscript.</p>
<p>The most important concern raised by both reviewers is about the specificity of the antibody used to detect the expression pattern and abundance of 5-HT2A receptors at the cells' surface. We acknowledge that GPCR antibodies, including those targeting 5-HT2A receptors, can be challenging in terms of specificity and reliability, particularly given the structural similarities within this receptor family. To address these concerns comprehensively, we propose the following systematic validation strategy:</p>
<p>(1) Cell-Type Specific Expression Analysis: We will systematically evaluate the antibody across different developmental stages and cell lines. The results from the stainings will be correlated with RNA sequencing data to provide quantitative validation of expression patterns. Cell types to be included will be:</p>
<p>· iPSCs (expected negative)</p>
<p>· Neural progenitors (expected positive)</p>
<p>· Mature neurons (expected positive)</p>
<p>· HEK cells (expected negative) This multi-stage analysis will allow us to track receptor expression through development and verify antibody specificity across distinct cellular contexts.</p>
<p>(2) Peptide Competition Study: We will perform blocking experiments using the specific peptide sequence against which the antibody was raised. By pre-incubating the antibody with its cognate peptide at established working concentration, followed by detailed documentation of signal reduction in peptide-blocked condition versus standard staining, we can demonstrate binding specificity. This approach will provide direct evidence of antibody selectivity for its intended target.</p>
<p>(3) Sequence Analysis and Specificity: We will perform a comprehensive protein BLAST analysis of the antigenic peptide sequence, assess potential cross-reactivity with related receptors, and evaluate species conservation and specificity. This in silico approach will complement our experimental validation and help identify any potential off-target binding sites.</p>
<p>(4) Additional Validation: While technically challenging, we will attempt knockdown studies using siRNA/shRNA approaches to provide additional validation of antibody specificity. This molecular intervention will offer another layer of validation through targeted reduction of the receptor.</p>
<p>We plan to present these results in a new supplementary figure that will provide a comprehensive overview of our validation efforts. Should we not be able to convincingly demonstrate the specificity of the antibody, we will discuss with the editors and reviewers to modify Figure 1 and exclude critical parts from the manuscript. While we find the results interesting and important to communicate, an omission would not critically impact the key message of the manuscript, which is the structural and molecular changes elicited by psilocin on human neurons. The strength of our multi-modal approach means that our core findings are supported by several independent lines of evidence beyond antibody-based detection.</p>
