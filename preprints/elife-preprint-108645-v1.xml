<abstract>
<p>In the first postnatal month, the developing mouse intestine shifts from an immature to a mature intestine that will sustain the organism throughout the lifespan. Here, we surveyed the mouse intestine in C57Bl/6 mice by RNA-Seq to evaluate the changes in gene expression over time from the day of birth through 1 month of age in both the duodenum and ileum. We analyzed gene expression for changes in gene families that correlated with the periods of NEC susceptibility or resistance. We highlight that increased expression of DNA processing genes and vacuolar structure genes, tissue development and morphogenesis genes, and cell migration genes all correlated with NEC susceptibility, while increases in immunity gene sets, intracellular transport genes, ATP production, and intracellular metabolism genes correlated with NEC resistance. Using trends identified in the RNA-Seq analyses, we further evaluated expression of cellular markers and epithelial regulators, immune cell markers, and adenosine metabolism components. We confirmed key changes with qRT-PCR and immunofluorescence. In addition, we compared some findings to humans using human intestinal biopsies and organoids. This dataset can serve as a reference for other groups considering the role of single molecules or molecular families in early intestinal and postnatal development.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The post-embryonic, developing intestine remains a dynamic organ that undergoes important molecular shifts as the crypts develop and the cellular composition matures. Exposures to the microbiome and nutrients cause additional programmatic changes. In the mouse, the postnatal period between day 0 and week 4 approximates the developmental sequence of premature human infants around 28-34 weeks’ gestation, as both species experience additional crypt-villous maturation and the development of Paneth cells during these intervals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>). While many groups have described the developmental sequence of gastrulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>) and gut tube formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>), as well as embryonic generation of the foregut (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>), midgut (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>), and hindgut (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>), less is known about the postnatal developmental sequence.</p>
<p>Studying human development during the second half of pregnancy has been challenging, owing to the difficulty of obtaining tissue from fetal intestine after about 24 weeks. Even when tissue can be obtained from premature infants, it is requisite that a disease is present, causing the need for surgical intervention – whether that be a congenital malformation of the intestine (duodenal atresia, gastroschisis, etc.) or an acute disease process (spontaneous perforation, necrotizing enterocolitis). Mouse models are frequently used to help us understand human intestinal development, however, most studies of intestinal development in mice focus on the in-utero period and important questions remain about postnatal development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>). In general, existing postnatal studies have focused on the role of single genes in modulating postnatal development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>). While there is a rich body of literature examining the impacts of the microbiome on postnatal intestinal development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>), comprehensive analyses of the postnatal intestinal sequence are lacking, especially compared to the breadth of studies on prenatal development. A study in Balb/c mice showed that cell proliferation is robust in the neonatal mouse and exceeds cell loss until around week three, when more adult-like homeostatic kinetics are attained (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>).</p>
<p>Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a devastating disease of intestinal necrotic injury that often leads to systemic illness and shock physiology, and carries a high mortality rate of about 20 percent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>). NEC most frequently occurs in premature infants, peaking around 30 weeks’ postmenstrual age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>). Postnatal mice from day 0-day 14 are used to model NEC, owing to the similarities in epithelial development with the period of susceptibility in premature humans, which peaks at 30 weeks postmenstrual age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>). After 2 weeks postnatal age, mice become resistant to experimental NEC unless other modifications are performed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>). We are interested in the natural developmental changes across this time frame, which may confer NEC susceptibility or resistance.</p>
<p>Apart from the possible relationships to NEC, we are also interested in understanding fundamental biological processes that occur during intestinal development in the neonatal period. While technological advances have allowed the advent of single-cell sequencing approaches for understanding mouse transcriptomics, isolation and representative preparation of both intestinal epithelium and mesenchyme simultaneously remains a challenge, which can make comparing between segments convoluted. Furthermore, rare cell types and RNAs present at a lower frequency can be difficult to capture in single-cell sequencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>). Therefore, we performed a time course analysis of postnatal development using bulk RNA-Seq of the full thickness mouse intestine, which includes epithelium and mesenchymal tissues. We also examined differences in gene expression patterns of the duodenum versus ileum. Findings were confirmed using other modalities and human tissue biopsies were used for comparison in select instances.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<sec id="s2a">
<title>The quality of our RNA-Seq dataset was high, and samples clustered together by timepoint</title>
<p>To examine the quality of the RNA-Seq dataset, we examined the total reads per sample; read numbers ranged from 56 to 185 million reads per sample (Supp. Fig. 1A). In general, ileal samples had fewer reads than duodenal ones. We also evaluated the exonic mapping rate, and most of the samples met our target threshold of 75%, although four of the ileal samples had mapping rates slightly below 70% (Supp. Fig. 1B). Principal component analysis (PCA) of all samples showed that duodenal samples and ileal samples intermixed and did not segregate by tissue type in early development but segregated more at later time points (Supp. Fig. 1C), suggesting that these regions were similar in gene expression through the first two weeks of life.</p>
<p>To analyze the clustering within each group, we also performed PCA for samples from each tissue independently. Duodenal samples generally clustered well by time point and followed a temporal sequence in the principal driver of variance, PC1 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). The samples from the ileum similarly clustered well and followed a temporal pattern in PC1 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>). Hierarchical clustering, which groups the samples by similarity, showed that the 3-week and 4-week samples were distinct from the other groups in the duodenum, while the day zero samples were also dissimilar from other groups (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C, 1D</xref>). The 2-day through 2-week samples were more closely related to each other. In the ileum, the 3- and 4-week samples again clustered apart from the rest of the group, but the 0d samples clustered similarly to the 2-day through 2-week samples. However, the samples from day 4 did not cluster tightly, particularly in the duodenum, and there was an outlier in the day 6 samples that did not cluster with the other two in duodenum or ileum. Given that the younger timepoints generally clustered tightly, and we had many time points, we opted to drop the day 4 samples and one of the day 6 samples from the rest of our analyses, to focus on the time points that gave us good replication between the samples and had higher reliability.</p>

<p>Analysis of gene expression using significantly differentially expressed (DE) genes (adjusted p-value/q-value &lt;= 0.005) demonstrated that significantly different gene expression in the duodenum was similar in 0-day and 2-day mice, 6-day, 8-day and 2-week mice, and 3-week and 4-week mice, as displayed in heatmap format (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>). The similarities between DE gene expression in the ileum were less linear with 0-day and 8-day aligning independently and 2-day, 6-day and 2-week samples appearing more similar in the DE gene profile (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F</xref>). 3-week and 4-week profiles were also similar, although 4-week samples appeared to have an additional cluster of highly DE genes compared to the 3-week samples (bottom right). See Supplemental File 1 for gene counts and differentially expressed gene lists.</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<title>Gene expression trends in the duodenum and ileum highlight key developmental gene expression changes</title>
<p>We next evaluated all differentially expressed genes across time in the duodenum (Supp. Fig. 2; Supp. File 2) and ileum (Supp. Fig. 3; Supp. File 3) and asked whether there were patterns in gene expression trends that were unique in each dataset. Using the top 3000 differentially expressed genes in each tissue (adjusted P-value threshold used &lt;= 0.005), we identified 20 gene sets with correlated gene expression trends. Because we are most interested in the ileum gene changes and how they may be related to NEC susceptibility, we then called out gene set clusters in the ileum that either were low during NEC susceptibility (day 0-day 14) and then increased at week 3-4, or that were elevated in earlier times points and then decreased significantly as the intestine matured. We performed gene ontology (GO) enrichment analyses on these smaller genes sets (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>) to identify overrepresented GO terms.</p>

</fig>
<p>Notably, genes for immunity, which are already known to be a critical factor in NEC, were present in one of the clusters (cluster 3). Other clusters that increased in the NEC-resistant time points encoded genes for metabolism and intracellular trafficking (cluster 2) and ATP/energy use (cluster 4). Gene groups that were elevated during NEC susceptibility compared to NEC resistant periods included tissue development (angiogenesis, metabolism, catabolism genes) (clusters 1), cell migration genes (cluster 11), DNA repair (cluster 7), and vacuole development (cluster 5). One gene set, cluster 17, was low initially at day 0 and day 2, then increased in the peak NEC time period from day 6 to 2 weeks, then decreased again in weeks 3 and 4, and this was enriched for genes associated with tissue development including extracellular matrix and smooth muscle gene families.</p>

<sec id="s2c">
<title>General intestinal markers are stable throughout time points</title>
<p>Given that we used full-thickness biopsies of the intestinal tissue for our analyses, we wanted to ensure that tissue samples were consistent throughout our dataset as an internal validation. We plotted expression of intestine specific markers <italic>CDX2</italic> (specification marker) and <italic>CDH1</italic> (E-cadherin, epithelial marker) and saw that expression for duodenum and ileum samples was relatively stable over time, while both were increased in duodenum versus ileum (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). The increased villus length in the duodenum likely explains this relative increase. The overall consistency of expression of these ubiquitous markers helps to establish reliable tissue sampling between time points.</p>

<title>Epithelial differentiation markers increase over time, while stem cell markers peak around postnatal week 1</title>
<p>One of the genes present in gene cluster 2 was villin, an epithelial marker, suggesting that epithelial expansion is represented by cluster 2. To examine this in more detail, we called out specific markers of epithelial cell sub-types. Expression of epithelial differentiation markers <italic>Vil1</italic> (Villin, all epithelium) and <italic>Muc2</italic> (Mucin 2, goblet cells) remained relatively low over the first 2 weeks of life, then increased significantly in weeks 3 and 4 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>). Similarly, and as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>), expression of <italic>Lyz1</italic> (Lysozyme 1, Paneth cells) also remained low in the first few weeks of life but was statistically increased from week 2 onward. In contrast to the differentiation markers, conventional intestinal stem cell (ISC) markers <italic>Lgr5</italic>, <italic>Olfm4</italic>, and <italic>Ascl2</italic> peak around 6-8 postnatal days, and are significantly higher in the duodenum than ileum (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>).</p>
<p>Meanwhile, expression of markers for enteroendocrine cells, <italic>Chga</italic> (chromogranin A), <italic>Sst</italic> (somatostatin), and <italic>Gcg</italic> (glucagon), did not follow a consistent pattern (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>).

<title>RNA expression of antimicrobial defensins and adaptive immune cells increase over time</title>
<p>Cluster 17 and the volcano plots comparing expression across all time points were highly enriched for defensins, so we also looked at these in isolation. We first compared expression of alpha defensins over time, and all defensins expressed in the duodenum and ileum increased over time (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref>, <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Overall expression of defensins was higher in the duodenum than the ileum, up to 3-fold higher for some of the genes. At week 4, <italic>Defa24, Defa3</italic>, and <italic>Defa23</italic> were the highest expressed in the duodenum, whereas <italic>Defa2, Defa23</italic>, and <italic>Defa 20</italic> were the highest in the ileum. We also evaluated markers for adaptive immune cell populations (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C</xref>). <italic>CD3g</italic> (T cells), and <italic>CD8</italic> (cytotoxic T cells) all remained low until 4 weeks. <italic>CD4</italic> (Th cells, intestinal macrophages) demonstrated low expression throughout the first postnatal month. <italic>CD19</italic> (B cells) also increased significantly at 4 weeks. Expression of T cell and B cell markers was similar between duodenum and ileum.</p>
<p>Expression of key gene markers for innate lymphoid cell (ILC) populations also changed over the postnatal time course (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6D</xref>). <italic>Tbx21/Tbet</italic> remained low until 4 weeks postnatal, suggesting that ILC1 do not populate the small intestine until later in postnatal life. <italic>Rora</italic>, a marker for ILC2, was higher in the immediate perinatal period and decreased over time. However, while expression fell by postnatal day 6 in the duodenum, levels remained higher in the ileum through week 2. <italic>Rorc</italic>, a marker for ILC3, remained more stable across development, but there was an increase in both duodenum and small intestine at 2 weeks postnatal. <italic>Tbx21</italic> is also expressed in inflammatory T cell populations cells, and <italic>Rorc</italic> in pro-fibrotic, IL-17 producing T cells, so some of the increase in <italic>Rorc</italic> expression may also be coming from T cells. Studies on ILC development in the postnatal intestine have been limited. We used qRT-PCR to confirm the expression pattern we saw for Rora, and indeed the ileum expression remained high until 3 weeks postnatal, while the duodenal expression began to decrease by 1 week postnatal (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6E</xref>).</p>
<p>The intestine is a site of active macrophage engagement, both from systemic macrophages and tissue-resident macrophages, which have different ontogenies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>). <italic>CD11b</italic>, a marker of innate immune cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>), remained fairly stable across development (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6F</xref>).

It was more similar to the human qRT-PCR data, which showed that organoids from older infants had higher <italic>Olfm4</italic> expression.

Therefore, we also wondered whether MHCII was expressed by the epithelium in early development and whether it could be involved in NEC. Indeed, MHCII positive cells did not emerge until week 4, when MHCII was highly expressed by certain crypt cells, likely to be ISCs based on prior reports and overlap with the OLFM4 distribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>). Finally, to analyze the production of CD19, which was expressed in early time points but increased significantly at week 4, we stained tissue sections for CD19 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>, column 4). Indeed, Peyer’s patches were small in area at day 0 and consistently enlarged over time, as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>). Interestingly, early postnatal Peyer’s patch (PP) tissue was highly cellular with DAPI+ cells and few CD19+ cells, and the proportion of CD19+ increased over time as a percentage of the total PP lesions, (Supp. Fig. 3C) indicating enlargement of the germinal centers over time.

<title>Components of extracellular adenosine metabolism are altered in the neonatal period</title>
<p>Because our ATP/energy use transcript expression in cluster 4 of our ileum dataset correlated with the NEC susceptibility period from 2 weeks forward, we considered ATP metabolism in NEC. Adenosine deaminase increased over time, and ADA this can contribute to both production of intracellular and extracellular adenosine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>). Others have shown that extracellular adenosine is important for immunomodulation and is a potent anti-inflammatory mediator in the intestine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>). Indeed, a study in mice showed that extracellular adenosine production can modulate the development of NEC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>). Extracellular adenosine is generated by cell surface molecules, where CD39 first catalyzes the production of ADP from ATP, and then CD73 generates adenosine from ADP (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8A</xref>). Receptors for extracellular adenosine are in the Adora family. Indeed, analyses of these genes in the duodenum and ileum showed that <italic>Cd73/Nt5e</italic> expression was significantly lower in early postnatal life compared to NEC-resistant periods at 2-4 weeks postnatal (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8B</xref>). In contrast, <italic>Adora2b</italic> expression started higher and decreased significantly over time in the ileum. <italic>Adora1</italic> and <italic>Cd39/Entpd1</italic> expression was relatively unchanged over time in the ileum but both appeared to be higher in the duodenum compared to ileum and then decrease over time. We used qRT-PCR to confirm these patterns (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8C</xref>) and saw that <italic>Cd73/Nt5e</italic> did tend to be higher in the ileum and decreased with maturation, whereas Adora2b expression decreased with ileum maturation. Differences between duodenum and ileum were less pronounced by qRT-PCR than by RNA-Seq, as we saw with earlier qPCR comparisons.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study we generated an RNA catalogue of the full-thickness duodenum and ileum in the postnatal intestine of mice and analyzed gene expression patterns over time. Our study is unique in its inclusion of many time points throughout the first month of life. Previously published studies on postnatal intestinal development used targeted qPCR and IF, featured fewer time points, and focused on select functions or groups of genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>). We also separately analyzed duodenum and ileum, and highlighted that some genes follow a similar pattern in proximal and distal small intestine, while others have distinct RNA expression patterns between the regions.</p>
<p>This study queried whether gene expression patterns from the dataset would inform any new ideas as to why the postnatal ileum is sensitive to NEC in the first two weeks of postnatal life. This approach highlighted genes associated with certain biological processes that are already known to be important in the development of NEC (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>), including the development of antimicrobial and immune genes. This dataset adds to previous studies by showing that there are developmental changes in the expression of key genes in these biological processes, which may be relevant to the developmental susceptibility to NEC. We also identified additional overrepresented biological processes that remain relatively unexplored (cellular metabolism, DNA repair, vacuole/phagolysosome function).</p>
<p>Our lab is interested in ISCs and epithelial homeostasis, particularly the role of WNT2B in control of epithelial development and homeostasis. Indeed, there were important differences in epithelial marker genes and regulators of epithelial maturation across this time course. Some of these cell lineages (Paneth cells/Lyz1) have been previously implicated in NEC, but the contributions of other lineages and the regulation of intestinal stem cells in the postnatal intestine are not well-studied. We have previously shown that WNT2B is required for normal numbers of ISC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>), and that WNT2B deficiency leads to increased inflammatory cytokine production in the colon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>). We hypothesized that relative ratios of WNT2B versus WNT3 in the small intestine versus colon explain why the small intestine is less affected by WNT2B loss of function, at least in mice. In this dataset, <italic>Wnt3</italic> expression was substantially higher than <italic>Wnt2b</italic> expression in both the duodenum and ileum, with the exception of immediately postnatal at day 0 and day 2 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>). This highlights the need to consider zonation when considering the roles of trophic factors on epithelial maintenance.</p>
<p>Due to a high degree of homology and redundant functions, <italic>Wnt3</italic> and <italic>Wnt3a</italic> are similar in intestinal function, such that most intestinal organoid medias contain <italic>Wnt3a</italic>. However, our data show that <italic>Wnt3a</italic> is not expressed in the mouse SI, at least through 1 month of age (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>). These Wnts are highly homologous and share some functional redundancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref>), however, their nucleotide sequences are only 55% identical with large regions of dissimilarity and whether they have any functional differences in controlling intestinal homeostasis is yet to be interrogated. Researchers who use organoids should be aware of this nuance. Interestingly, WNT5A, the prototypical non-canonical Wnt, was more highly expressed in the ileum than the duodenum, in contrast to other expressed Wnt family members. The implications of this are not yet clear.</p>
<p>The immune system is rapidly developing in the postnatal period, as the intestine first encounters the microbiome and is exposed to both microbial and food-related antigens. Despite initiation of milk feeding within hours after birth, adaptive immune cell markers did not robustly increase until week 4 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C</xref>). Whether this is related to the introduction of standard rodent chow at day 21 in our mice or the resultant decrease in breastmilk consumption, or something else entirely, cannot be determined from our approach. Intestinal macrophage markers remained static across the first postnatal month (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6E</xref>), which may be due to the predominance of tissue-derived macrophages in this organ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref>). The changes in expression of markers specific for ILC populations were interesting. Not unexpectedly, the ILC1 markers were expressed on a much lower level than ILC2 or ILC3 markers (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6D</xref>). Expression of ILC2 marker <italic>Rora</italic> was higher in early time points, and expression was more persistent in the ileum compared to the duodenum. No dedicated gene marker has been identified to date for ILC1 and ILC3, however, so expression of these markers may be confounded by T cell gene expression.</p>
<p>Peyer’s patch size increased over time, as previously described, but interestingly the proportion of B cells within the Peyer’s patches (PPs) increased significantly over time, suggesting rapid growth of the germinal centers in the postnatal period (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>, Supp. Fig. 4). Others have shown that the postnatal microbiome drives development of PPs, and that early postnatal antibiotic exposure decreases the number of intestinal B cells in flow cytometric analyses, however they only examined samples from P20 onward. The effects of antibiotics, microbial composition, and other postnatal exposures on expansion of GCs requires additional study.</p>
<p>Finally, we considered the changes in gene expression for ATP metabolism (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>) and how they may relate to extracellular adenosine. We found that expression of CD79 receptor, required for extracellular adenosine production, was low in early development and increased during the NEC-resistant period after 2 weeks. Conversely, expression of adenosine receptors was higher in the NEC-susceptible period. Interestingly, others have shown that adenosine levels are high in neonatal blood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref>), however, knowledge about intestinal adenosine is limited. As others have shown that exogenous adenosine, or inhibition of the adenosine receptor, can increase protection against NEC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref>), it will be important to characterize baseline ileal adenosine metabolism and whether it is perturbed in prematurity.</p>
<p>The main limitation of this study is that most data were generated by bulk RNA-Seq. We have done some select confirmatory studies using qRT-PCR and immunofluorescence but have not recapitulated the majority of the dataset by other means. This dataset is intended as a starting point for our lab and others when considering novel hypotheses, and secondary approaches should always be used to further interrogate the RNA expression in a given experimental system. Furthermore, total mRNA does not equate to transcriptionally active mRNA or to protein levels, so other assays would be needed to remark on those aspects of translational control.</p>
<p>Another caveat is that we intended to collect data from day 4, but these samples were not of high enough quality, so we omitted that data. Some dynamic changes occur for ISC genes around day 6, so it is not yet clear whether these markers change soon after day 2 or closer to day 6. Finally, this study is done in C57Bl/6 mice, so applicability to other backgrounds cannot be assumed.</p>
<p>It is important to keep in mind that these samples are all under homeostatic conditions, and the absence or abundance of a gene in this dataset may not be reflective of its expression during stress or injury conditions. Furthermore, exposures are changing over the period we queried, so microbial changes and nutrient changes are occurring but should be relatively consistent in all postnatal mice. We were curious about the natural sequence of events in the normal postnatal environment under routine conditions, so we did not manipulate any of these exposures. Of course, the microbiome is well known to play an important role in development of the epithelial transcriptome and in postnatal methylation, as other groups have demonstrated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref>).</p>
<p>In sum, the first postnatal month of life is one of the most dynamic times for intestinal growth and crypt expansion. Characterizing the normal developmental sequence can help us to identify developmental aberrations in neonatal intestinal diseases that may drive pathogenesis. We hope this dataset can serve as a reference point for others studying specific genes or biological processes during postnatal health and disease.</p>

<title>Research Ethics</title>
<p>The study was approved by Boston Children’s Hospital Institutional Review Board for the human subjects research (BCH IRB 10-02-0053 and P00027983) in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. All animal experiments were done in accordance with Boston Children’s Hospital Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).</p>

<sec id="s4b">
<title>Sex as a biological variable</title>
<p>The role of sex was not considered as a biological variable in this study, and male and female samples were used indiscriminately for all analyses. This was mainly owing to the high cost of RNA-Seq and the difficulty in telling male from female mice at the earliest time points of the study. We do provide data on sex of the human samples, when able.</p>

<title>Mouse model</title>
<p>C57/Bl6 mice (Jackson labs) mice were used for experiments, and for RNA-Seq experiments, we used large litters and collected mice across postnatal ages to the extent possible (usually 2-3 time points per litter), to limit potential variation in microbial exposures. Mice were housed in standard germ-free conditions and kept with the dam until 21 days postnatal and then transitioned to standard rodent chow. We used both male and female mice for all experiments.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4e">
<title>Time course sample collection</title>
<p>Mice were euthanized at the following time points: day 0, day 2, day 4, day 6, day 8, 2 weeks, 3 weeks, and 4 weeks. For the purposes of RNA-Seq, 2cm of proximal intestine immediately after the pylorus was collected for the “duodenum” sample and 2cm of distal intestine immediately before the ileocecal junction was collected for the “ileum” sample. For the histology samples, we isolated the full small intestine and then transected at the mid-way point to create proximal (duodenal-jejunal, called “duodenum” throughout) and distal (“ileum”) intestinal segments. The intestine was cleaned of feculent material using cold PBS and 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA), and then tissue was opened longitudinally, rolled, and placed in a fixation cassette (Swiss roll method). All samples were Swiss-rolled with orientation of the rolls in a proximal to distal fashion, in order to be able to compare consistently between segments.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4f">
<title>RNA-Seq</title>
<p>Intestinal tissue was placed into Trizol LS (ThermoFisher) and homogenized with a bead homogenizer. RNA was isolated using the Direct-zol kit (Zymo Research) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The library was prepared by the Dana Farber Next Generation Sequencing Core Facility using a KAPA library quantification kit (Roche). Sequencing was done on an Illumina NovaSeq 6000 with total RNA.</p>
<p>All samples were processed using a bulk RNA-seq pipeline implemented in the bcbio-nextgen project (bcbio-nextgen,1.2.8-1c563f1). Gene expression was quantified using Salmon (version 0.14.2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref>) using the mm10 transcriptome (Ensembl). Differentially expressed (DE) genes between the duodenum and ileum at specific time points were identified using DESeq2 (version 1.30.1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref>). The DE threshold was set at adjusted P-value &lt;= 0.005. All analyses performed in R utilized R version 4.0.3.</p>

<title>Analysis of Gene Expression Families Over Time</title>
<p>We analyzed gene expression over time on the duodenum and ileum samples separately using the LRT method in DEseq2.

We visually analyzed the expression patterns to identify gene groups that fluctuated from the time of NEC susceptibility (less than 2week of age) to the time when mice become resistant to NEC (2 weeks of age onward). We performed functional analysis using the R package clusterProfiler (version 3.18.1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref>) on these gene sets to identify GO biological processes or KEGG pathways that are enriched in each cluster of genes.

<title>Biopsy samples from human infants</title>
<p>Biopsied tissue from endoscopic resections or surgeries was fixed in formalin and embedded in paraffin.

<title>Establishment of Human organoids</title>
<p>Human intestinal organoids were generated using StemCell® protocol that was adapted as follows. Tissue vials containing about 10 biopsy sized pieces of small intestine that were cryopreserved in 10% DMSO in Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS) were quickly thawed in a water bath. The thawed tissue was transferred into a 15 ml conical containing 5 ml of ice-cold Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS). The conical was centrifuged at 290 rcf for 5 minutes at 4°C. The supernatant was discarded, and the wash step with PBS was repeated. After supernatant was aspirated, tissue with about 1 mL of PBS was transferred into a 1.5 mL Eppendorf under a sterile hood. Using scissors, the pieces of tissue were minced until they were about 1-2 mm in diameter. Tissue suspended in PBS was transferred to a new 15 mL conical and the PBS was aspirated once the tissue settled.</p>

<sec id="s4k">
<title>Propagation of Human Organoids</title>
<p>Organoids were resurrected and expanded from frozen prior to use. Briefly, vials were thawed in a 37°C water bath until just starting to liquefy and then rinsed with Dulbecco’s modified eagle’s media/F12. They were plated in 24-well plates within 50μL of Matrigel (Corning), allowed to solidify in a 37°C incubator for 10 mins, and then 500μL of human small intestinal organoid media was added (Supplementary Table 2). Media was changed every 2-3 days and organoids were passaged roughly once a week until used for experiments. All experiments were done at passage 15 or lower.</p>

<title>In-situ hybridization</title>
<p>RNAscope Multiplex Fluorescent Reagent Kit v 2 (Advanced Cell Diagnostics, ACD) method was used to localize mRNA expression in FFPE intestinal sections according to a modified version of the manufacturer’s protocol. First, the slides were baked at 60° C for 1 hour and then washed twice with Xylene (Sigma Aldrich) and twice with 100% ethanol for five minutes each. Next, the sections were treated with hydrogen peroxide reagent for 10 minutes RT, washed twice with distilled water, and hot-rinsed with boiling distilled water for 15 seconds, followed by incubation with 1X Target Retrieval Buffer at 99°C for 5 minutes in steamer. Afterward, the slides were hot-rinsed in distilled water, dehydrated in 100% ethanol, and dried for 5 minutes RT. The sections were then incubated with Protease Plus Reagent at 40°C for 30 minutes, washed twice with 1X Wash Buffer, and hybridized with LGR5 probe at 40°C for 2 hours. After hybridization according to the manufacturer’s protocols, the sections were washed twice, incubated with DAPI (1:1000) for 15 minutes RT, washed again, and finally sealed with a coverslip. ACD designed the probe used in this study (Supplementary Table 1).

<title>Immunofluorescence</title>
<p>Tissues were fixed in 4% PFA overnight at 4°C, washed in 50% ethanol for 1h, and then transitioned into 70% ethanol. Tissues were embedded in paraffin and sectioned (4-6μm). Slides were prepared for staining using Trilogy buffer (Sigma Aldrich) in a pressure cooker for 15 minutes according to the manufacturer’s recommendation. Slides were then rinsed with boiling Trilogy buffer for 5 minutes, washed with deionized water, and then rinsed further in PBS. Blocking buffer was added to each slide (blocking buffer: 0.3% Tween-20, 10% normal donkey serum, 0.05% bovine serum albumin in PBS) and incubated at room temperature for 1 hour, gently shaking. Primary antibody (Supplementary Table 1) was then added in blocking buffer at 4°C overnight. Slides were then washed in PBS and incubated with the secondary antibody for 1 hour at room temperature. DAPI (1:1000) was added for 10 minutes and then the slides were washed again and sealed with a coverslip.

<title>Statistical Analyses</title>
<p>Statistical analysis of RNA-Seq data is described separately above. For experiments comparing two groups (e.g., duodenum vs ileum), the Student’s t test was used in PRISM 9 (GraphPad Software). For experiments assessing expression changes over multiple time points, ANOVA was used and individual points were compared to the day 0 baseline sample. Data were assumed to be normally distributed. For all experiments, p&lt;0.05 was considered significant.</p>

<p>This study presents a <bold>useful</bold> inventory of genes that are up- and down-regulated in the mouse small intestine (duodenum and ileum) during the first postnatal month; the data were collected and analyzed using <bold>solid</bold> and validated methodology and can be used as a starting point for additional validation of specific markers and for follow-up functional studies. Some aspects of the study were <bold>incomplete</bold>, with claims being only partially supported by the data, and it is suggested that additional validation be performed. The authors attempted to correlate gene expression changes with periods of high and low NEC susceptibility, but these correlations are speculative and not supported by functional follow-up studies. Discussion of gene expression changes with NEC susceptibility would be more appropriate to include in the Discussion section and to be tempered in the results section.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this manuscript, the authors aimed to clarify the transcriptional changes across murine postnatal small intestinal development (0 days to 1 month) in both the duodenum and ileum, a period that shows morphological similarity to 20-30 week old fetal humans. This is an especially critical stage in human intestinal development, as necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) usually manifests during these stages.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors assessed numerous timepoints between 0 days and 1 month in the postnatal mouse duodenum and ileum using bulk RNA transcriptomics of bulk-isolated tissues. Cellular deconvolution, based on relative marker expression, was used to clarify immune cell proportions in the bulk RNA sequencing data. They confirmed some transcriptional targets found in vivo primarily in mouse via qrtPCR and immunohistochemistry, but also in human fetal tissues and isolated organoids, and are of decent quality.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The overall weakness of this study, as mentioned by the authors themselves, is that the bulk transcriptomic data generated for the study were isolated from non-fractionated bulk intestinal tissue. This makes it difficult to interpret much of this data regarding cellular fractions found across developmental time. It is difficult to rationalize the approach here, as even isolation protocols of epithelial-only or mesenchyme-only tissues for bulk RNA sequencing are well established. The authors address some of these concerns using cellular deconvolution for immune cell populations, which I think might be helpful if they expanded this analysis to other cell types (mesenchyme, endothelium, glia). However, I would assume that bulk isolations across developmental time are going to be influenced primarily by the bulk of tissue-type found at each time point - primarily epithelium. But this is also confirmed by the immune transcripts becoming more apparent later in their time series, as this system becomes more established during weaning. This study might also be strengthened by comparison with data that is publicly available for early fetal stage development in humans. Comparisons between the duodenum and ileum could be strengthened by what we already know from adult data, from both epithelial- and mesenchyme-isolated fractions. The rationale of using the postnatal mouse as a comparison to NEC is also a little unclear- perhaps some of the developmental processes are similar, however, the environments are completely different. For example, even in early postnatal mouse development, you would find microbial activity and milk.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This work presents a valuable resource by generating a comprehensive bulk RNA sequencing catalogue of gene expression in the mouse duodenum and ileum during the first postnatal month. The central findings of this work are based on an analysis of this dataset. Specifically, the authors characterized molecular shifts that occur as the intestine matures from an immature to an adult-like state, investigating both temporal changes and regional differences between the proximal and distal small intestine. A key objective was to identify gene expression patterns relevant to understanding the region-specific susceptibility and resistance to necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) observed in humans during the postnatal period. They also sought to validate key findings through complementary methods and to provide comparative context with human intestinal samples. This study will provide a solid reference dataset for the community of researchers studying postnatal gastrointestinal development and diseases that arise during these stages. However, the study lacks functional validation of the interpretations.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) The inclusion of numerous time points (day 0 through 4 weeks) and comparative analyses throughout the first postnatal month.</p>
<p>(2) Validation of key interpretations of RNA-seq data by other methods.</p>
<p>(3) Linking mouse postnatal development to human premature infant development, enhancing its clinical relevance, particularly for NEC research. The inclusion of human intestinal biopsy and organoid data for comparison further strengthens this link.</p>
<p>(4) The investigation covers a wide array of developmental gene categories with known significance, including epithelial differentiation markers (e.g., Vil1, Muc2, Lyz1), intestinal stem cell markers (e.g., Lgr5, Olfm4, Ascl2), mesenchymal markers (e.g., Pdgfra, Vim), Wnt signaling components (e.g., Wnt3, Wnt5a, Ctnnb1), and various immune genes (e.g., defensins, T cell, B cell, ILC, macrophage markers).</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) The primary limitation is that there is no functional validation. The study primarily focuses on the interpretation of RNA expression. This is a common limitation of transcriptomic &quot;atlas&quot; studies, but the functional and mechanistic relevance of these interpretations remains to be determined.</p>
<p>(2) The data are derived from bulk RNA-Seq of full-thickness intestinal tissue. While this approach helps capture rare cell types and both epithelial and mesenchymal components simultaneously, it does not provide cell-type-specific gene expression profiles, which might obscure important nuances. Future investigations using single-cell sequencing would be a logical follow-up.</p>
<p>(3) The day 4 samples were omitted due to quality issues, which might have led to missing some dynamic changes, especially given that some ISC genes show dynamic changes around day 6.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This study uses bulk mRNA sequencing to profile transcriptional changes in intestinal cells during the early postnatal period in mice - a developmental window that has received relatively little attention despite its importance. This developmental stage is particularly significant because it parallels late gestation in humans, a time when premature infants are highly vulnerable to necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). By sampling closely spaced timepoints from birth through postnatal week four, the authors generate a resource that helps define transcriptional trajectories during this phase. Although the primary focus is on murine tissue, the authors also present limited data from human fetal intestinal biopsy samples and organoids. In addition, they discuss potential links between observed gene expression changes and factors that may contribute to NEC.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The close temporal sampling in mice offers a detailed view of dynamic transcriptional changes across the first four weeks after birth. The authors leverage these close timepoints to perform hierarchical clustering to define relationships between developmental stages. This is a useful approach, as it highlights when transcriptional states shift most dramatically and allows for functional predictions about classes of genes that vary over time. This high-level analysis provides an effective entry point into the dataset and will be useful for future investigations. The inclusion of human fetal intestinal samples, although limited, is especially notable given the scarcity of data from late fetal timepoints. The authors are generally careful in their presentation of results, acknowledging the limitations of their approach and avoiding over-interpretation. As they note, this dataset is intended as a foundation for their lab and others, with secondary approaches required to more fully explore the biological questions raised.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>One limitation of the study is the use of bulk mRNA sequencing to draw conclusions about individual cell types. It has been documented that a few genes are exclusively expressed in single cell types. For instance, markers such as Lgr5 and Olfm4 are enriched in intestinal stem cells (ISCs), but they are also expressed at lower levels in other lineages and in differentiating cells. Using these markers as proxies for specific cell populations lowers confidence in the conclusions, particularly without complementary validation to confirm cell type-specific dynamics.</p>
<p>Validation of the sequencing data was itself limited, relying primarily on qPCR, which measures expression at the same modality rather than providing orthogonal support. It is unclear how the authors selected the subset of genes for validation; many key genes highlighted in the sequencing data were not assessed. Moreover, the regional differences reported in Lgr5, Olfm4, and Ascl2, appearing much higher in proximal samples than in distal ones, were not recapitulated by qPCR validation of Olfm4, and this discrepancy was not addressed. Resolving such inconsistencies will be important for interpreting the dataset.</p>
<p>The basis for linking particular gene sets to NEC susceptibility rests largely on their spatial restriction to the distal intestine and their temporal regulation between early (day 0-14) and later (weeks 3-4) developmental stages. While this is a reasonable approach for generating hypotheses, the correlations have limited interpretive power without experimental validation, which is not provided here. Many factors beyond NEC may drive regional and temporal differences in intestinal development.</p>
<p>Finally, the contribution of human fetal biopsy samples is minimal. The central figure presenting these data (Figure 4A) shows immunofluorescence for LGR5, a single stem cell marker. The staining at day 35 is not convincing, and the conclusions that can be drawn are limited to confirming the localization of LGR5-positive cells to crypts as early as 26 weeks.</p>
