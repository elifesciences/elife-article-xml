<title>Abstract</title><p>The key elements for fear extinction learning are unexpected omissions of expected aversive events, which are considered to be rewarding. Given its reception of reward information, we tested the hypothesis that the cerebellum contributes to reward prediction error processing driving extinction learning via its connections with the ventral tegmental area (VTA). Forty-three young and healthy participants performed a three-day fear conditioning paradigm in a 7T MR scanner. The cerebellum and VTA were active during unexpected omissions of aversive unconditioned stimuli, particularly during initial extinction trials. Increased functional connectivity was observed between the cerebellum and VTA, indicating that the cerebellum could positively modulate VTA activity, which in turn might facilitate dopaminergic signaling during fear extinction learning. These results imply that an interaction between the cerebellum and VTA should be incorporated into the existing model of the fear extinction network.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Deficits in learning to extinguish previously associated threat responses to cues that no longer signal danger are thought to be one of the main causes in the development of anxiety disorders, including post-traumatic stress disorder and social anxiety disorder<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. Exposure therapy addresses this deficit and attempts to compensate for failed or absent extinction learning from the past<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. This is modeled effectively with extinction training in classical fear conditioning paradigms where the previously paired conditioned stimulus (CS+) is no longer followed by the aversive unconditioned stimulus (US)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>. At the beginning of extinction training the omission of the US is unexpected and this unexpected lack of the US is considered to be rewarding<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. This reward prediction error is thought to drive safety learning. This newly learned safety association should then inhibit the initially learned fear association (which is never fully lost)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>The reward system in the brain is primarily associated with the mesolimbic dopamine system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>, i.e., the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and the ventral striatum. In fact, recent rodent studies provide strong evidence that the VTA is central for extinction learning, and that (reward) prediction errors are encoded in a subset of VTA neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>. Importantly, new evidence indicates that the cerebellum receives reward signals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>, and has direct efferent connections with the mesolimbic dopaminergic system, in particular the VTA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) findings in healthy human participants suggest that the cerebellum is involved in processing of prediction errors in fear conditioning<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. Ernst et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup> studied acquisition of learned fear responses using a partial reinforcement rate, i.e., a subset of CS+ trials were not reinforced during acquisition training. Cerebellar activations were strongest in the unreinforced CS+ trials, when the US was expected but did not occur. An unreinforced CS+ trial can be considered as a very first extinction trial, and cerebellar activations may reflect prediction errors driving extinction learning. Likewise, recordings from the VTA in rodents showed strong activations at the time the US is expected and does not occur during initial extinction trials<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>. The aim of the present fMRI study is therefore to test the hypothesis that the cerebellum contributes to fear extinction learning via its connection to the VTA.</p>
<p>In contrast to the previous one-day study design<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>, here we used a three-day design with acquisition training on day 1, extinction training on day 2 and a recall test on day 3. This multi-day study design allowed enough time for consolidation of both fear and extinction memory traces. Furthermore, to increase the size of the reward prediction error at the initial US omission in extinction training trials, a full (100%) reinforcement rate was used during acquisition training. Previous studies showed significant spontaneous recovery of learned fear in initial recall test trials (unreinforced CS+) following extinction training in humans, which allowed us to test for cerebellar activations related to reward prediction errors also on day 3. Additionally, after the recall test on day 3, a reacquisition phase with a partial reinforcement rate (i.e., with unexpected US omissions between reinforced trials) and a subsequent reextinction phase were realized. Taken together, we were able to access cerebellar activity related to the unexpected omission of the US at various points during the experiment. We used a deep reinforcement learning model fitted to trial-by-trial skin conductance response (SCR) data to compute individual prediction errors. 7T fMRI allowed us to assess VTA activation. Results showed significant functional interaction between the cerebellum and VTA related to prediction errors, particularly during initial extinction trials. These findings suggest that the cerebellum contributes to extinction learning via the VTA, and thus supports safety learning inhibiting the initial fear association.</p>

<p>During fear acquisition training (day 1), participants underwent a fully reinforced, semi-instructed differential fear conditioning protocol. Participants quickly learned the associations, and their responses decreased as expected due to habituation effects (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>, top row). SCRs for the CS+ were significantly higher than for the CS- and decreased in late trials. Non-parametric ANOVA-type statistics revealed a significant effect of Stimulus (CS+ vs. CS-; <italic>F</italic><sub>1</sub> = 16.28; <italic>p</italic>&lt;.001) and Time (early vs. late; <italic>F</italic><sub>1</sub> = 24.49; <italic>p</italic>&lt;.001). No significant Stimulus x Time interaction was observed (<italic>F</italic><sub>1</sub> = 3.33; <italic>p</italic>=0.07).</p>
<p>During extinction training (day 2), SCRs were significantly higher for the CS+ than for the CS– only in initial extinction trials (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>, top row). Non-parametric ANOVA-type statistics revealed a significant effect of Stimulus (CS+ vs. CS-; <italic>F</italic><sub>1</sub> = 6.57; <italic>p</italic>=0.01) and Time (early vs. late; <italic>F</italic><sub>1</sub> = 21.10; <italic>p</italic>&lt;.001). The Stimulus x Time interaction was not significant (<italic>F</italic><sub>1</sub> = 2.83; p=0.09). For pupil size responses (PSRs), the Stimulus x Time interaction was significant (<italic>F</italic><sub>1</sub> = 4.28; <italic>p</italic>=0.039). Post-hoc tests showed that PSR related to the CS+ was significantly lower during late extinction compared to early (least squares means test; p &lt; .001), but not for PSR related to the CS- (least squares means test; p = 0.64; see supplementary materials), indicating extinction learning towards the CS+.</p>
<p>During the recall test (day 3), SCRs for CS+ were significantly higher than for CS- (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>, bottom row). In late recall, no difference between SCRs for CS+ and CS- were observed. Non-parametric ANOVA-type statistics revealed a significant main effect of Stimulus (CS+ vs. CS-; <italic>F</italic><sub>1</sub> = 4.19; <italic>p</italic>=0.04), Time (early vs. late; <italic>F</italic><sub>1</sub> = 32.47, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001) and a Stimulus x Time interaction (<italic>F</italic><sub>1</sub> = 5.27; <italic>p</italic>=0.02). Post-hoc tests revealed that SCRs for CS+ were significantly higher than for CS- in early trials (least squares means test; <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) but not in late trials (least squares means test; <italic>p</italic> = 0.98). SCRs for both stimuli significantly decreased in late trials compared to early trials (least squares means test; both: <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001).</p>
<p>During reacquisition on day 3, SCRs for the CS+ were significantly higher than for the CS- and decreased for both stimuli in late reacquisition (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>, bottom row). Non-parametric ANOVA-type statistics revealed a significant effect of Stimulus (CS+ vs. CS-; <italic>F</italic><sub>1</sub> = 26.65, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001), Time (early vs. late; <italic>F</italic><sub>1</sub> = 30.37, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001) and a Stimulus x Time interaction (<italic>F</italic><sub>1</sub> = 6.34, <italic>p</italic>=0.01). Post-hoc tests showed that both stimuli were higher in early vs late reacquisition training (CS- early vs. CS- late; p = 0.02; CS+ early vs. CS+ late; p &lt; .001), and a significant difference between stimulus types early and late (all p values &lt; .001).</p>
<p>During reextinction on day 3, SCRs related to the CS+ were significantly higher than for the CS- although the difference was small (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>, bottom row). Non-parametric ANOVA-type statistics revealed a significant main effect of Stimulus (CS+ vs. CS-; <italic>F</italic><sub>1</sub> = 4.3; <italic>p</italic>=0.04), but not for Time (early vs. late; <italic>F</italic><sub>1</sub> = 0.2; <italic>p</italic>=0.65) nor for the Stimulus x Time interaction (<italic>F</italic><sub>1</sub> = 1.1; <italic>p</italic>=0.29). For PSRs, the Stimulus x Time interaction was significant (<italic>F</italic><sub>1</sub> = 4.43; <italic>p</italic>=0.035), and PSRs related to the CS+ were significantly higher than to the CS- in early trials, but not in late trials (see supplementary materials).</p>
<p>In the last phase on day 3, three CS+ trials were unexpectedly reinforced (“unexpected US phase”). SCRs for the CS+ were significantly higher than for the CS- (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>, bottom row). Non-parametric ANOVA-type statistics revealed a significant main effect of Stimulus (CS+ vs. CS-; <italic>F</italic><sub>1</sub> = 5.68; <italic>p</italic>=0.02), but neither for Time (early vs. late; <italic>F</italic><sub>1</sub> = 0.26; <italic>p</italic>=0.61) nor for the Stimulus x Time interaction (<italic>F</italic><sub>1</sub> = 2.81; <italic>p</italic>=0.09).</p>

<p>Valence, arousal, fear and US expectancy ratings of the CS+ did not differ significantly from the CS- before acquisition training (Supplementary table 3,4). Following acquisition training, the CS+ was rated as more arousing, fearful and unpleasant compared to the CS-. Participants expected the US to follow the CS+ but not the CS-. Although less pronounced, these CS+/CS- differentiations persisted after extinction training and recall test. The difference between CS+ and CS- increased at the end of day 3, when CS+/US pairings were reintroduced.</p>
<p>Non-parametric ANOVA-type statistics showed a significant main effect of Stimulus, Time and a Stimulus x Time interaction (all <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001; Supplementary table 4). Post-hoc tests revealed significant differences between stimulus type (CS+, CS-) following acquisition training, extinction training, recall test and at the end of day 3 but not after habituation.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The cerebellum and VTA were active during unexpected omissions of aversive unconditioned stimuli, particularly during initial extinction trials. Importantly, increased functional connectivity was observed between the cerebellum and VTA, indicating that during unexpected omissions in extinction training, the cerebellum could positively modulate VTA activity. These results support the view that an interaction between the cerebellum and VTA should be incorporated into the existing model of the fear extinction network. Furthermore, given that the unexpected omission of an aversive stimulus can be considered rewarding, data suggest that the cerebellum contributes to reward processing in humans, and that this may be one way how the cerebellum modulates non-motor functions, in our case the control of emotions. Our findings build on previous research in rodents showing that the cerebellum modulates addictive, social and depression-like behavior via direct projection to VTA in rodents<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Cerebellar activations were most prominent in trials with maximum prediction errors, i.e., during the initial extinction training phase, but were also seen in early recall, reacquisition and early reextinction. The activations in lobule VI and Crus I are consistent with previous findings by Ernst et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup> during unexpected omissions in a partially reinforced acquisition phase.</p>
<p>Additionally, other studies have reported activations in these regions during the prediction of the US in extinction training<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup> and during unexpected omissions of aversive stimuli<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>. More broadly, activations in lobule VI and Crus I have been observed during US prediction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>, particularly in the early phases of acquisition training. Conversely, unexpected rewards lead to activation in Crus I<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>, and a meta-analysis implicated left lobule VI and Crus I in both the anticipation and processing of rewarding outcomes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>. Anticipation-related activations were more hemispheric, whereas rewarding outcome activations were more paravermal.</p>
<p>Activated areas in more lateral parts of lobule VI and Crus I overlap with multi-demand regions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>, whereas activations neighboring the vermis overlap with emotional regions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>. The main components of the multi-demand (or executive) neural network are working memory, attention and inhibition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>. Thus, attention-related processes involved in fear conditioning may also contribute to cerebellar activations. Attention-related processes have been related to the salience of the stimulus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>, but are also thought to change when a cue is followed by an unexpected outcome with more attention being paid in the next trial<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>. Attention related processes may therefore contribute to activations in the more lateral cerebellar parts of lobule VI/Crus I. However, unexpected omission of the US should lead to increased attention to the CS in the next trial and therefore increased activation towards the CS (which was not the case) and not at the time the US was presented and did not occur.</p>
<p>Our findings of increased activation in the VTA related to the unexpected omission of the aversive US aligns well with rodent data<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. In rodents, it has been shown that dopamine neurons in the VTA are active in initial extinction trials, and that lack of this dopamine signal prevents extinction learning<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>. In a more recent study, Salinas-Hernandez et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup> observed that these dopamine neurons project to extinction-related neurons of the nucleus accumbens, and receive input from the dorsal raphe. Our data show that the VTA is also involved in extinction learning in humans, and provide first evidence that the VTA receives input from the cerebellum during extinction learning. Esser et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup> found that the administration of L-Dopa in healthy human participants enhanced activation of the nucleus accumbens which was functionally coupled with the VTA at the time of unexpected omission of the US in early extinction learning, which is in good agreement with our findings.</p>
<p>The unexpected omission of the aversive US is thought to be rewarding and fMRI signals in the cerebellum and VTA may be related to reward prediction errors. Whereas the VTA has long been known to process rewards, and fMRI data in humans indicate that the VTA is active related to the unexpected presentation of rewards<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>, the cerebellum has only recently been found to process reward signals in rodents<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>. FMRI signals are known to be driven by synaptic input<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup>. In the cerebellum this is mainly related to mossy fiber input to the cerebellar cortex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup>. There is evidence, however, that granule cell activity also modulates vasodilatation and likely contributes to fMRI BOLD signals in the cerebellar cortex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup>. Likewise, recent evidence suggests that activation of dopamine neurons in the VTA leads to increased BOLD signals using DREADD-fMRI in rodents<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup>. Human fMRI-PET studies have shown that VTA BOLD activation in response to rewards correlates with increases in dopamine in the striatum, suggesting that the fMRI signal in the SN/VTA is related to dopaminergic neuron activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></sup>. FMRI signals in the cerebellar cortex and VTA may therefore reflect incoming reward-related signals, prediction error processing or, maybe most likely, both. The origin of the afferent reward signals to the cerebellum remains unclear; while an early study showed afferent connections from the VTA to the cerebellum<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref></sup>, this finding has not been replicated in more recent research<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref></sup>. However, preliminary evidence from Guarque-Chabrera et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref></sup> suggests the existence of a connection from the VTA to the cerebellum.</p>
<p>In rodents, a subset of VTA dopamine neurons has been found to be active when the US is expected and does not occur, and are therefore considered to represent prediction error signals driving extinction learning<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>. The VTA, however, also contains neurons which are active during the presentation and prediction of threat<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref></sup>, and likewise we observed fMRI activation of the VTA related to threat prediction and presentation. Cerebellar activations and their interactions are likely not limited to reward prediction errors; they may also be related to unexpected presentation of aversive stimuli. Because aversive stimulus presentation results in pronounced cerebellar activations, we were unable to separate cerebellar activation related to the unexpected (initial acquisition trials) and the expected (late acquisition trials) presentation of the US.</p>
<p>Although, the present findings are consistent with the interpretation of prediction error related activations in the VTA (and cerebellum), based on the present fMRI data, we cannot decide whether activations reflect surprise signals (i.e., unsigned prediction error related signals) or signed prediction error signals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref></sup>. Rodent data show that cerebellar neurons in the cortex and nuclei increase activations both related to the unexpected presentation and omission of reward signals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref></sup>, which would indicate that the cerebellum primarily contributes to unsigned (reward) prediction errors. Likewise, a meta-analysis of human prediction error showed that activations in the cerebellum were more consistently related to unsigned prediction errors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Results showed significant functional interaction between the cerebellum and VTA related to prediction errors in unexpected omission trials in extinction training, which was further confirmed by similar functional interactions in spontaneous recovery trials on day 3, and unexpected omissions of the US in unreinforced trials in a partially reinforced reacquisition phase. Predictive output of the cerebellum may be linked to the timing of the unconditioned response and therefore its omission and may help to refine prediction error signals in the VTA.</p>
<p>Notably, the unexpected US omission area in the cerebellum was more prominent on the left, while we applied the US to the right. In our previous work it was also the left cerebellum which was mainly activated, however, stimulation was always done on the left<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref></sup>. As outlined above, we believe that cerebellar activation is reward related. In a recent meta-analysis of fMRI data in monetary reward tasks, reward outcome was also related to the left cerebellum (i.e., lobule VI in the cerebellar hemisphere and vermis)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>. There is good evidence that emotional information is most prominently processed in the right cerebral hemisphere<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref></sup>. The present data suggest that emotional processing may also be lateralized in the cerebellum, with the left cerebellar hemisphere projecting to the right cerebral cortex and vice versa. Lateralization of positive emotions to left cerebellar lobule VI has also been reported by Liu et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref></sup>. Furthermore, emotion-related tasks resulted in increased activity of the left cerebellar hemisphere in patients with anorexia nervosa compared to controls<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref></sup>. Meta-analyses of fMRI studies of emotional tasks, however, report mostly bilateral cerebellar activations with no clear lateralization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref></sup>. These studies primarily focused on emotion recognition tasks. Future research should explore the lateralization of emotional processing in the cerebellum using a variety of emotional tasks. In addition to emotions, there is also a preference of the right cerebral hemisphere for the ventral fronto-parietal attention network, which has been related to the detection of potentially harmful events<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref></sup>. Thus, as outlined above, attention-related processes involved in fear conditioning may also contribute to (lateralized) cerebellar activations.</p>
<p>In the following, we discuss potential limitations of our study. Firstly, while we demonstrated functional connectivity in the DCM analysis, the results were weaker with PPI. PPI is known to frequently lack power and to have a high proportion of false negatives<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref></sup>, particularly for event-based designs. Additionally, the low number of unexpected events in our experiment, due to the 100% reinforcement/non-reinforcement rates in acquisition training (which was designed to induce maximum prediction error in the initial extinction trials), may have made detecting activation challenging. Furthermore, a lack of specificity of the unexpected omission condition to the cerebellum-VTA interaction may have contributed. As the PPI regressor is demeaned, any persistent activation (i.e., due to an anatomical connection) will decrease detected connectivity. Because cerebellar and VTA activation co-occur not only in response to unexpected US omissions, but also to US presentation and prediction, this lack of specificity could have weakened our results. The same reasons apply for the lack of observation in functional connectivity between the DCN and the VTA.</p>
<p>Secondly, in the DCM analysis, we observed strong modulation related to unexpected US omissions when using the cerebellar cortex and VTA as volumes of interest (VOIs), but observed only trend-level results when substituting the cerebellar cortex with the DCN. This is likely explained due to the high iron content in the DCN causing susceptibility artefacts and reducing signal<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">73</xref></sup>. Although we opted for a whole-brain sequence with a conventional echo- time in order to generate a dataset of general value, future studies could opt for lower echo times and optimize for detection of signal in the DCN<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">74</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Thirdly, the extent of the VTA varies depending on the MRI atlas used. The VTA in the atlas from Pauli et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">75</xref></sup> is about 4 times smaller than the VTA in the atlas by Trutti et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">76</xref></sup> due to different VTA definitions used. Our average volumes are in good accordance with Trutti et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">76</xref></sup>, which in turn is in good accordance with histological data. The VTA and its boundaries, particularly laterally, are not clearly visible on MRI scans and were identified by using landmarks such as the substantia nigra, red nucleus, interpeduncular fossa and the cerebral aqueduct. We have approximated the VTA region as closely as we could, but cannot rule out imperfect masks, especially at both lateral ends of the VTA.</p>
<p>In conclusion, our study provides evidence that the cerebellum contributes to fear extinction learning via its connections with the VTA, possibly by modulating dopaminergic VTA neurons processing (reward) prediction errors driving fear extinction learning. Previous studies found that the cerebellum modulates addictive and social behavior via direct projection to VTA in rodents. Our findings extent this observation to the control of emotions. Added knowledge to the fear extinction network, on the other hand, may provide new ways of improving exposure therapy by targeting the dopaminergic system or stimulating the cerebellum specifically during unexpected learning events.</p>

<title>Fear conditioning paradigm</title>
<p>Participants underwent a three-day differential fear conditioning paradigm. The paradigm presentation was controlled by a computer running Presentation (version 21.0, Neurobehavioral System Inc, Berkeley, CA). Participants were shown two visual stimuli (square and diamond) as CS (CS+ and CS-) and informed that electrical stimulations would be applied during the experiment. Three types of trials were used: reinforced CS+ (CS+ paired with the US; CS+/US), unreinforced CS+ (no US) and unreinforced CS-. The CS- was never reinforced.</p>
<p>The paradigm consisted of seven phases separated over three days (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). On day 1, the experiment started with a habituation phase consisting of 8 unreinforced CS- and CS+ trials (4 CS+ trials, 4 CS- trials, presented in semi-randomized order). This phase is intended to decrease novelty effects and enable participants to acclimate to the scanner environment and presentation of visual stimuli. The habituation phase was followed by acquisition training consisting of 32 trials with fully reinforced CS+ (16 CS+/US, 16 CS- trials), during which the fear association was learned. On day 2, extinction training was applied which consisted of 32 unreinforced trials (16 CS+, 16 CS-). On day 3, the recall test, reacquisition, reextinction and the unexpected US phase were applied. The recall test consisted of 16 unreinforced trials (8 CS+, 8 CS-). This phase tested the recall of extinguished fear responses and showed spontaneous recovery (see Results). Reacquisition, reextinction, and the unexpected US phases were done in a single continuous fMRI run without pauses between sequences. The partially reinforced reacquisition phases consisted of 36 trials (15 CS+/US trial, 3 CS+, 18 CS-) with 3 unexpected omissions of the US, reextinction consisted of 24 trials (12 CS+, 12 CS-) and the unexpected US phase consisted of 28 trials (3 CS+/US trial, 11 CS+, 14 CS-) with 3 unexpected reinforced CS+ trials (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). Learned fear responses were measured by skin conductance responses (SCRs) and pupil size reactions (PSRs) in each trial. The reacquisition, reextinction and unexpected US phases were included to increase the number of trials with high prediction errors (i.e., discrepancy between US expectation and actual US presentation).</p>

<caption><p><bold>A</bold>: Overview of the three-day fear conditioning paradigm. Day 1 consists of habituation and acquisition training, day 2 consists of extinction training, and day 3 consists of the recall test, reacquisition, reextinction and the unexpected US phase. In acquisition training, the CS+ is reinforced 100% of the time, while reacquisition and the unexpected US phases contain 3 unexpected US omissions and 3 unexpected US presentations, respectively, with respective reinforcement rates of 83.3% and 21.4%. Extinction, the recall test, reacquisition and reextinction are marked in purple to indicate that these phases are of interest when studying unexpected US omissions. Extinction, recall test and reextinction show a gradient, as in these phases the US omissions are gradually less unexpected (as opposed to distinct unexpected US omission events during the partially reinforced reacquisition phase). <bold>5B</bold>: Schematic of participant lying in the MRI scanner. EDA was measured on the left-hand hypothenar eminence (EDA; blue and purple cables). The US was applied to the first dorsal interosseous muscle area of the right hand; red cable). The button box was held in the right hand. Dielectric bags and cushions were included to reduce susceptibility artifacts and head movement. The participants viewed a screen placed at the end of the scanner bore through mirrors, and the eyes were simultaneously imaged and tracked by an infrared camera. <bold>5C</bold>: Mean absolute prediction error values for each trial estimated from SCRs, with CS+ and CS- responses paired in blocks.

<p>We used the model from Batsikadze et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup> to optimize our experimental design. Values for US prediction and US prediction error produced by the model were recorded during simulation. Simulations were repeated for different paradigm CS sequences, and the sequence which required a short number of trials and still yielded high prediction errors was selected.</p>
<p>The CS+ and CS- were presented in equal numbers during the first and second half of each phase, regardless of whether the CS+ was followed by a US or not. Counterbalancing was implemented for the visual CS (CS+ square and CS- diamond, or CS+ diamond and CS- square) as well as for the order of presentation of the CS during the unreinforced habituation, extinction training, and recall test phases (i.e., CS+ presented first or CS- presented first). The reinforced acquisition training and reacquisition phases always started with a CS+. The two orders of CS presentation were pseudorandomly generated, similar to Ernst et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. Participants were instructed to pay attention to any possible connection between the CS and US presentations. They were also informed that the patterns of CS and US presentations would stay the same across all phases. However, they were not told about the CS/US contingencies or the timing and occurrence of the US.</p>
<p>In the analysis, the focus was on trials containing unexpected omissions of the US (CS+/no US) with high prediction error values. These trials occurred during early extinction, early recall, reacquisition and the reextinction phase.</p>

<title>CS visual stimuli</title>
<p>Visual stimuli were displayed on an fMRI monitor (BOLD-screen 32, Cambridge Research Systems Ltd., Rochester, UK) placed at the end of the scanner bore which was projected to the participant using a mirror system (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>). Two pictures of black geometric figures (a square and a diamond shape) on a gray background were used as CS+ and CS-. Both CS were presented for 6 s. The period of the CS was shortened from 8 s used in our previous study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup> to 6 s to decrease the length of the experiment, while still being able to assess SCRs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>. In the periods between visual stimuli a fixation cross was shown (time of ITI: varies between 9 s and 13.5 s).</p>

<sec id="s4c2">
<title>US aversive stimulus</title>
<p>In reinforced CS+ trials, the visual stimulus co-terminated with the presentation of the aversive US, an electric shock (100 ms) applied to the first dorsal interosseous muscle area of the right hand via a 6.5 mm concentric surface electrode (WASP electrode, Specialty Developments, Bexley, UK). The US was produced by a high voltage DC stimulator (DS7A, Digitimer Ltd., London, UK) and consisted of four consecutive 500 µs current pulses (maximum output voltage: 400 V) with an inter pulse interval of 33 ms. The location of the US electrode was kept constant across all days of measurement by marking the electrode position with a permanent marker on day 1 and 2. Before the first experimental phase began, the individual electrical stimulation intensity threshold was calibrated to be perceived as ‘very unpleasant but not painful’. To reach the threshold, the current strength was progressively increased and modulated according to each participant’s feedback. The calibrated US intensity was increased by 20 % to compensate for possible habituation to the US, which could result in a weakening of the conditioned responses as successfully done in previous studies of our group<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">81</xref></sup>. The US intensity remained the same for the three days of the experiment (mean US intensity: 3.8 (SD = 2.9) mA, range 0.6-19.2 mA).</p>

<title>Physiological data acquisition</title>
<p>During each phase, SCRs and pupil size were recorded. SCRs were acquired with appropriate hardware filters sampling at 2 kHz through an MP160 Data Acquisition Hardware unit (BIOPAC Systems Inc, Goleta, CA). Two SC electrodes were attached to the left-hand hypothenar eminence. Pupil size was measured using an MRI compatible eye tracking system (Avotec Inc, Stuart, FL). Calibration of the eye tracking system was performed prior to each phase to track gaze position on the screen.</p>

<sec id="s4e">
<title>Self-reports</title>
<p>After each learning phase, participants completed questionnaires using a 4-button fiberoptic response device (Current Designs, Haverford, PA). The Likert scale questionnaires assessed self-reports such as arousal (rated on a 1-9 scale from 1: “very calm” to 9: “very nervous”), valence (rated on a 1-9 scale from 1: “comfortable” to 9: “uncomfortable”), and fear (rated on a 1-9 scale from 1: “not afraid” to 9: “very afraid”) related to the visual stimuli. The questionnaires also included questions about US perception and CS-US contingency. Additionally, participants completed standardized questionnaires before the start of the experiment to assess handedness, depression, anxiety, and stress levels. All participants were screened for contraindications of 7T MRI.</p>

<title>Skin conductance analysis</title>
<p>To eliminate high frequency artefacts, skin conductance data was first low-pass filtered at 10 Hz (62<sup>nd-</sup>order Blackman FIR filter) in MATLAB (Release 2022b, RRID:SCR_001622, The MathWorks Inc., Natick, MA). SCRs were defined as the maximum trough-to peak-amplitude within a given time interval after CS onset using semi-automated peak detection implemented in a MATLAB-based EDA-Analysis App<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">82</xref></sup>. A minimum amplitude criterion of 0.01 μS was used as the SCR detection threshold. In each trial, SCRs were evaluated for two distinct time windows: the conditioned response within a time window of 1.0 s to 5.9 s after CS onset and the unconditioned response within a time window of 6 s to 10 s after CS onset (irrespective of whether a US was presented). To account for between-subjects variance, the resulting raw SCR amplitudes were increased by 1 μS and normalized through a logarithmic transformation (LN(1+SCR))<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">83</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">84</xref></sup>.</p>

<title>Pupil size analysis</title>
<p>Preprocessing of the raw pupil size data was performed to detect and remove blinks<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">85</xref></sup>. Trials with fewer than 50% of their data points remaining after blink removal were excluded from the analysis. For each trial, the baseline was computed as the mean pupil size during the 500 ms period prior to CS onset. The baseline was subtracted from the corresponding pupil size and the result was divided by the baseline to compute the pupil size response<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">86</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">87</xref></sup>. The mean pupil size response for CS+ and CS- trials were calculated in the time windows from 4 to 5.9 s and 6.0 to 8.0 s for the CS and US pupil size response, respectively. Pupil size responses during possible US presentation were excluded (5.9 to 6 s). The time window for the CS was chosen based on Jentsch et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">86</xref></sup> who observed the largest differentiation between CS+ and CS- 2 s prior to the US. The US time window was chosen to match the CS time window. For valid trials, a missing pupillometric data point was considered as ‘not a number value’ to not influence the pupil size mean computation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">87</xref></sup>.</p>

<title>Behavioral statistical analysis</title>
<p>For physiological data, due to non-normal distribution (SCR and PSR: Shapiro-Wilk test, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001), statistical analysis was performed using the ANOVAF option in the PROC Mixed procedure in SAS Studio 3.8 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA). This method is suggested for addressing skewed distributions, outliers, or small sample sizes. To ensure more reliable results, an ANOVA-type statistic (ATS) was applied, with the denominator degrees of freedom set to infinity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">88</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">90</xref></sup> as the use of finite denominator degrees of freedom can result in increased type I errors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">91</xref></sup>. The ATS was calculated for each phase (habituation, acquisition training, extinction training, recall test, reacquisition, reextinction, unexpected US phase), with stimulus type (CS+, CS-) and block (early vs. late) as within-subjects factor and SCRs or PSRs as dependent variables.</p>
<p>For analyses of self-reports, an ATS with repeated measures was calculated with stimulus type and phase as within-subjects factor and ratings (valence, arousal, fear and US expectancy) as dependent variables.</p>
<p>For behavioral results, a <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05 criterion was used to determine if results were significantly different from those expected if the null hypotheses were correct. Post-hoc comparisons were calculated using least square means tests and were adjusted for multiple comparisons using the Tukey-Kramer method.</p>

<title>Computational modeling</title>
<p>An artificial agent was trained to predict the likelihood of a shock for a given visual input in a virtual version of the experiment as in Batsikadze et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>. The model was based on reinforcement learning<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c92">92</xref></sup> and consisted of a deep neural network (DNN)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93">93</xref></sup>. The model hyper- parameters were fit to SCRs recorded in the experiment, which served as a read-out of the participants’ expectation of an US.</p>
<p>The same simplified visual stimuli for trial stimuli <italic>s</italic><sub><italic>t</italic></sub> and the same encoding for reinforcement signals <italic>r</italic><sub><italic>t</italic></sub> were used as in Batsikadze et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>. We employed the same network architecture, which comprised two hidden fully connected layers with 64 units each and an output layer with activation function <italic>φ</italic>. For each of the two trial sequences experienced by the participants, 25 randomly initialized agents were trained during the fitting of hyper- parameters, and 100 randomly initialized agents were trained to derive trial-by-trial values for predictions <italic>v</italic><sub><italic>t</italic></sub> and prediction errors <italic>δ</italic><sub><italic>t</italic></sub>from the best fit. On each trial <italic>t</italic>, the agent stored an experience tuple <italic>e</italic><sub><italic>t</italic></sub> = (<italic>s</italic><sub><italic>t</italic></sub>, <italic>r</italic><sub><italic>t</italic></sub>, <italic>δ</italic><sub><italic>t</italic></sub>) in memory for later replay<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c94">94</xref></sup>. The agents were trained using the backpropagation algorithm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c95">95</xref></sup> on batches of experiences of size b, which were sampled randomly from memory with a probability that was proportional to a priority score <italic>p</italic>:

Priority scores depended on the experiences’ recency <italic>λ</italic><sup><italic>τ</italic></sup>, where <italic>τ</italic> is the time passed since the experience and <italic>λ</italic> is a decay factor.

The parameter RPE ∊ {Yes, No} indicates whether the replay priorities also depended on the magnitude of the US prediction error. The number of replays <italic>i</italic> was varied to control the degree of learning on each trial.</p>
<p>While the previous model could account for ABA renewal<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>, it cannot account for spontaneous recovery in the AAA paradigm, because, in the model, extinction in the same context overwrites the association formed during acquisition. Hence, we extended the model by an additional replay phase, which takes place between habituation, acquisition, extinction, recall and reextinction phases, and serves to recover the initially acquired association. This replay phase prioritized experiences according to the reinforcement <italic>r</italic><sub><italic>k</italic></sub>received in a trial and consisted of a total 100 replays of batches of size 128.

<title>fMRI analysis</title>
<p>The 1st level analysis was done in MNI space, defining conditions for both the CS and US window (i.e., CS+, CS-, US post CS+, no US post CS+, no US post CS-) separately for each phase. Regressors were calculated from the conditions in SPM12 by convolving a canonical hemodynamic response function with events, which were modelled as delta functions in an event-based design (i.e., the duration of each event is 0 s). Beta weights were fitted for each regressor by a general linear model for each voxel fMRI time series. Contrasts were computed as linear combinations of beta weights. Contrasts included main effects of conditions, CS differentiation (CS+ &gt; CS-, CS- &gt; CS+), unexpected omission of the US (no US post CS+ &gt; no US post CS-) and US presentation (US post CS+ &gt; no US post CS-). Values in contrast maps were converted to t-statistic values in first level analysis. Contrast maps are combined and used in a one-sample t-test for second level analysis in SPM12. Tests for significance (p&lt;0.05) were done after threshold-free cluster enhancement (TFCE toolbox in SPM12, R174, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dbm.neuro.uni-jena.de/tfce/">http://dbm.neuro.uni-jena.de/tfce/</ext-link>) and family-wise error (FWE) corrections.

<title>Event-based analysis</title>
<p>In addition to main effects of conditions (e.g., during acquisition training), events were additionally separated over time for each experimental phase. For fear acquisition training, extinction training, recall test, reacquisition, reextinction and the unexpected US phase, events were grouped in two equal-size blocks representing early and late halves of those phases (e.g., the 8 first CS+ trials of fear acquisition training correspond to early acquisition and the 8 last CS+ trials of fear acquisition training correspond to late acquisition). Trials with unexpected events—such as unexpected US presentations or omissions—were treated as separate single trial regressors. These included the initial three trials of acquisition training, extinction training, recall test, reacquisition and reextinction and specific events such as the three unexpected US omissions in reacquisition. Notably, all single trials comprised CS+ trials, with CS- trials also being modeled as single trials to facilitate paired analysis.</p>

<p>A global conjunction between unexpected US omission parametric modulation contrasts during extinction, the recall test and reacquisition was multiplied with a cerebellum mask and showed a region in lobule VI and Crus I. This region was used as a cerebellar cortex (lobule VI and Crus I) volume of interest (VOI). Deep cerebellar nuclei (DCN) and VTA VOIs were drawn for each participant. Drawing of the DCN (i.e., the left and right dentate, globose, emboliform and fastigial nuclei) was done by an expert annotator using both MP2RAGE and QSM information in ITK-SNAP (version 3.8.0)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c109">109</xref></sup>. The nuclei of the DCN were combined into a single bihemispheric VOI. Drawing of the VTA was done by adjusting estimated masks with both MP2RAGE and QSM information, using the red nuclei, substantia nigra, the cerebral aqueduct and interpeduncular fossa as landmarks. Initial masks were estimated for the VTA by inversely transforming the probabilistic atlas by Trutti et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">76</xref></sup> thresholded at a probability of p&gt;0.4. All drawn masks were transformed into MNI space. After transformation to MNI space, a probabilistic atlas was generated by averaging binary masks for each structure across participants. The probabilistic atlas was thresholded so that the volume of each structure matched the average volume across participants. For drawing of globose, emboliform and fastigial nuclei, the thresholded atlas was inversely transformed from MNI to T1 space in order to add missing nuclei for each participant with lower quality QSM data. The VTA VOI was used as a seed region in the PPI analysis. In addition, the cerebellar cortex (CB), DCN and VTA VOIs were used as nodes in the 2-node dynamic causal modelling (DCM) networks. The DCN and VTA VOIs were used as masks for displaying fMRI activations in coronal slices and 3D renderings.</p>

<title>Functional connectivity: PPI</title>
<p>For the PPI analysis, the VTA VOI was used to extract time series with SPM12 in MNI space. Time series were used as physiological regressors, and psychophysiological regressors were added for each condition using the gPPI toolbox<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c110">110</xref></sup>. Both first- and second-level analyses were performed with the same contrasts as defined in the parametric modulation (e.g., no US x prediction error during extinction) analysis. To summarize connectivity in the parametric modulation analysis, all contrasts related to unexpected US omissions were combined in a single contrast within the gPPI toolbox.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4m5">
<title>Functional connectivity: DCM</title>
<p>To calculate dynamic causal models (DCMs), the cerebellar cortex (CB) and VTA VOIs were used to extract time series in a concatenated version of the event based and parametric modulation models using SPM12<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c111">111</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c113">113</xref></sup>. Each condition was defined as input to the CB and VTA nodes (i.e., CS+, CS-, US post CS+, no US post CS+, no US post CS-), while each prediction or prediction error related event-based contrast (i.e., CS+ &gt; CS-, no US post CS+_first3 &gt; no US post CS-) or parametric modulation (i.e., no US prediction error) could modulate the reciprocal intrinsic connections. Recurrent connections were active but were not modulated. Parametric Empirical Bayes (PEB) was used for analysis on the second level<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c114">114</xref></sup>. All DCM and PEB analyses were done within SPM12.</p>

<title>Pupil size responses (PSRs)</title>
<p>During habituation on day 1, PSRs related to the CS+ and CS- did not differ significantly (non- parametric ANOVA-type statistic, main effects, all <italic>p</italic>&gt;0.2).</p>
<p>During fear acquisition training on day 1, PSRs were significantly higher in CS+ trials than in CS- trials, and PSR was more pronounced in early compared to late trials. Non-parametric ANOVA-type statistics revealed a significant main effect of Stimulus (CS+ vs. CS-; <italic>F</italic><sub>1</sub> = 39.51; <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001) and Time (early vs. late; <italic>F</italic><sub>1</sub> = 24.31; <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001). No significant Stimulus x Time interaction was observed (<italic>F</italic><sub>1</sub> = 0.58; <italic>p</italic>=0.45).</p>
<p>During extinction training on day 2, PSRs for CS+ significantly decreased early vs late but there were no differences between early and late trials for CS-. Non-parametric ANOVA-type statistics revealed a significant main effect of Time (early vs. late; <italic>F</italic><sub>1</sub> = 18.21; <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001) and a significant Stimulus x Time interaction (<italic>F</italic><sub>1</sub> = 4.28; <italic>p</italic>=0.04). No significant main effect of Stimulus was observed (CS+ vs. CS-; <italic>F</italic><sub>1</sub> = 1.12; <italic>p</italic>=0.29). Post-hoc tests showed that PSRs related to the CS+ were significantly lower during late extinction compared to early (least squares means test; <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001). This result was not observed for PSRs related to the CS- (least squares means test; <italic>p</italic>=0.64).</p>
<p>During the recall test on day 3, PSRs for the CS+ were significantly higher than for the CS- in both early and late trials, though the difference was less pronounced in late trials. The PSRs for the CS+ were significantly higher in early compared to late trials. Non-parametric ANOVA- type statistics revealed a significant effect of Stimulus (CS+ vs. CS-; <italic>F</italic><sub>1</sub> = 6.59; <italic>p</italic>=0.01) and Time (early vs. late; <italic>F</italic><sub>1</sub> = 6.41; <italic>p</italic>=0.01) and a significant Stimulus x Time interaction (<italic>F</italic><sub>1</sub> = 4.87; <italic>p</italic>=0.03). Post-hoc tests showed that PSRs related to the CS+ were significantly higher than towards the CS- early but not late (least squares means test; early <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05; late <italic>p</italic>=0.86) and that the PSRs related to the late CS+ were significantly lower than early (least squares means test; <italic>p&lt;0.05</italic>)</p>
<p>During reacquisition on day 3, PSRs for CS+ were significantly higher in early trials, but no significant difference in PSRs for CS- early vs late was observed. PSRs for CS+ and CS- were significantly different between early and late. Non-parametric ANOVA-type statistics reveal a significant effect of Stimulus (CS+ vs. CS-; <italic>F</italic><sub>1</sub> = 47.87; <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001), Time (early vs. late; <italic>F</italic><sub>1</sub> = 4.54; <italic>p</italic>=0.03) and Stimulus x Time interaction (<italic>F</italic><sub>1</sub> = 7.7; <italic>p</italic>=0.006). Post-hoc tests using the least squares means test showed that PSRs related to the CS+ were higher early in the phase (least square means test; <italic>p</italic>=0.004) but not the CS- (least square means test; <italic>p</italic>=0.97). Stimulus types were significantly different both early and late (least square means test; CS+ vs. CS-; all: <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.008).</p>
<p>During reextinction on day 3, PSRs for CS+ were significantly higher than for CS- early, but the difference became insignificant in late trials. Non-parametric ANOVA-type statistics revealed a significant main effect of Stimulus (CS+ vs. CS-; <italic>F</italic><sub>1</sub> = 9.1; <italic>p</italic>=0.003) and a Stimulus x Time interaction (<italic>F</italic><sub>1</sub> = 4.43; <italic>p</italic>=0.04), but not a significant main effect of Time (early vs. late; <italic>F</italic><sub>1</sub> = 0.83, <italic>p</italic>=0.36). Post-hoc test showed a significant difference between the CS+ and CS- early but not late (least squares means test; early: <italic>p</italic>=0.01; late: <italic>p</italic>=0.77).</p>
<p>During the unexpected US phase on day 3, PSRs for the CS+ were higher than for the CS-. Non- parametric ANOVA-type analysis revealed a significant main effect of Stimulus (CS+ vs. CS-; <italic>F</italic><sub>1</sub> = 17.35; <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001), but not of Time (early vs. late; <italic>F</italic><sub>1</sub> = 0.83; <italic>p</italic>=0.363) and the Stimulus x Time interaction (<italic>F</italic><sub>1</sub> = 0.03; <italic>p</italic>=087)</p>

<caption><p>Pupil size responses for each trial, with CS+ and CS- responses paired in blocks. Bar plots on the top right show early and late mean responses for both CS+ and CS-. Reinforcement of the CS+ by a US (CS+/US) is indicated by filled squares. On day 1, there was no differentiation between CS+ and CS- in the habituation phase, with significant differentiation emerging during acquisition training. On day 2, there was a loss of differentiation during extinction training. On day 3, during initial recall, participants exhibited spontaneous recovery, i.e., a return of differential responses after extinction training. During initial reacquisition, there were again differential responses to the CS+ and CS-, which decreased in reextinction and the unexpected US phase. Mean values are shown with error bars representing the standard error of the mean. CS: Conditioned stimulus; US: Unconditioned stimulus; PSR: Pupil size response.</p></caption>

<body>
<p>Nio and colleagues address an important question about how the cerebellum and ventral tegmental area (VTA) contribute to the extinction learning of conditioned fear associations. This work tackles a critical gap in the existing literature and provides new insights into this question in humans through the use of high-field neuroimaging with robust methodology. The presented results are novel and will broadly interest both the extinction learning and cerebellar research communities. As such, this is a very timely and impactful manuscript. However, there are several points that could be addressed during the review process to strengthen the claims and enhance their value for readers and the broader scientific community.</p>
<p>Points to Address:</p>
<p>(1) Reward Interpretation and Skin Conductance Responses (SCR):</p>
<p>
A central premise of the manuscript is that 'unexpected omissions of expected aversive events' are rewarding, which plays a critical role in extinction learning. The authors also suggest that the cerebellum is involved in reward processing. However, it is unclear how this conclusion can be directly drawn from their task, which does not explicitly model 'reward.' Instead, the interpretation relies on SCR, which seems more indicative of association or prediction rather than reward per se. Is SCR a valid metric of reward experienced during the extinction of feared associations? Or could these findings reflect processes tied more closely to predictive learning? Please, discuss.</p>
<p>(2) Reinforcement Agent and SCR Modeling:</p>
<p>
The modeling approach with the deep reinforcement agent treats SCR as a personalized expectation of shock for a given trial. However, this interpretation seems misaligned with participants' actual experience - they are aware of the shock but exhibit evolving responses to it over time. Why is this operationalization useful or valid? It would benefit the manuscript to provide a clearer justification for this approach.</p>
<p>(3) Clarity and Visualization of Results:</p>
<p>
The results section is challenging to follow, and the visualization and quantification of findings could be significantly improved. Terms like 'trending' appear frequently - what does this mean, and is it worth reporting? Adding clear statistical quantifications alongside additional visualizations (e.g., bar or violin plots of group means within specific subregions within the cerebellum, or grouped mean activity in VTA and DCN) would enhance clarity and allow readers to better assess the distribution and systematicity of effects. Furthermore, the figures are overly complex and difficult to read due to the heavy use of abbreviations. Consider splitting figures by either phase of the experiment or regions, and move some details to the supplemental material for improved readability.</p>
<p>(4) Theoretical Context for Paradigm Phases:</p>
<p>
The manuscript benefits from the comprehensive experimental paradigm, which includes multiple phases (acquisition, extinction, recall, reacquisition, re-extinction). This design has great potential for providing a more holistic view of conditioned fear learning and extinction. However, the manuscript lacks clarity on what insights can be drawn from these distinct phases. What theoretical framework underpins the different stages, and how should the results be interpreted in this context? At present, the findings seem like a display of similar patterns across phases without sufficient interpretation. Providing a stronger theoretical rationale and reorganizing the results by experimental phase could significantly improve readability and impact.</p>
<p>(5) Cerebellum-VTA Connectivity Analysis:</p>
<p>
The authors argue that the cerebellum modulates VTA activity, yet they perform the PPI analysis in the reverse direction. Why does this make sense? In their DCM analysis, they found a bidirectional relationship (both cerebellum - VTA and VTA-cerebellum), yet the discussion focused on connectivity from the cerebellum to VTA. A more careful interpretation of the connectivity findings would be useful - especially the strong claims in the discussion on the cerebellum providing the reward signal to the VTA should be tempered.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Building upon the group's previous work, this study used a 3-day threat acquisition, extinction, recall, reextinction, and reacquisition paradigm with 7T imaging to probe the mechanism by which the cerebellum contributes to fear extinction learning. The authors hypothesise this may be via its connection to the VTA, a known modulator of fear extinction due to its role in reward processing. Using complementary analysis methods, the authors demonstrate that activity with the cerebellum, DNC, and VTA is modulated by predictions about the occurrence of the US, which shows regional specificity. They show trend-level evidence that there is increased functional connectivity between the cerebellum and VTA during all phases of the paradigm with unexpected omissions. They also present a DCM which indicates that the cerebellum could positively modulate VTA activity during extinction learning. This study adds to a growing literature supporting the role of the historically overlooked cerebellum in the control of emotions and suggests that an interaction between the cerebellum and VTA should be considered in the existing model of the fear extinction network.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors address their research question using a number of complementary methods, including parametric modulation by model-derived expectation parameters, PPI, and DCM, in a logical and easily understood way. I feel the authors provide a balanced interpretation of their findings, presenting numerous interpretations and offering insight with regard to reward vs attention or unsigned prediction errors and the directionality of the interaction they identify. The manuscript is a timely addition to growing literature highlighting the role of the cerebellum in fear conditioning, and emotion generation and regulation more generally.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Subjective and skin conductance responses do not completely support the success of the learning paradigm. For example, CS+/CS- differentiation in both domains persisted after extinction training. I do not feel that this negates the findings of this manuscript, though it raises questions about the parametric modulators used, and the interpretation of the neural mechanisms proposed if they do not strongly relate to updated subjective appraisals (the goal of extinction therapy). My interpretation of the manuscript suggests there are some key results based upon contrasts that have as few as three events; I am a little unsure about the power and reliability of these effects, though I await author clarification on this matter. There are a number of unaddressed deviations from the pre-registered protocol that I have asked the authors to elaborate upon.</p>

<p>(1) Reward Interpretation and Skin Conductance Responses (SCR):</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The reviewer raises a valid point, as the model from which we derive prediction errors describes predictive learning—specifically, the occurrence of shock—without incorporating additional reward learning effects. SCRs are used to fit the model’s hyperparameters but do not directly measure reward; rather, they serve as a marker of arousal.</p>
<p>In our paradigm, SCRs are measured during CS presentation and primarily reflect predictive learning, as they are closely linked to contingency awareness. The association between estimated prediction errors during unexpected US omissions and reward remains reliant on existing literature.</p>
<p>In the revised manuscript, we will further elaborate on these points to clarify the distinction between predictive learning and direct reward processing, while contextualizing our findings within the broader literature on reward signaling and fear extinction.</p>

<p>(2) Reinforcement Agent and SCR Modeling:</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Notably, we do not use SCR as a personalized expectation measure due to its limited reliability at the individual level; instead, the model's hyperparameters are fitted on the entire SCR dataset, yielding per-trial prediction and prediction error estimates for each CS sequence rather than for individual participants.</p>

<p>(3) Clarity and Visualization of Results:</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We recognize that the presentation of our results can be improved and will take steps to enhance figure clarity, also ensuring that trend-level results are clearly distinguished.</p>

<p>(4) Theoretical Context for Paradigm Phases:</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Regarding the differences across experimental phases, we recognize the theoretical significance of these distinctions. However, our primary focus is on identifying commonalities in unexpected US omission responses across phases rather than emphasizing phase-specific differences. Nevertheless, we will provide a brief clarification on phase differences to enhance the manuscript’s interpretability.</p>

<p>(5) Cerebellum-VTA Connectivity Analysis:</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Furthermore, we acknowledge that our conclusion regarding the modulation of the dopaminergic system by the cerebellum should be framed more cautiously. We will temper our claims to better reflect the bidirectional and potentially indirect nature of cerebellum-VTA interactions. Additionally, we plan to include PPI results using a cerebellar seed showing the VTA, potentially in the supplementary material.</p>

<p>(1) Success of extinction learning based on Self-reports and SCRs?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The reviewer points to a problem, which is inherent to extinction learning: The initial fear association is not erased, but merely inhibited, and is prone to return. Although the recall phase follows the extinction phase, we did not expect a complete inhibition of the conditioned response; instead, spontaneous recovery is expected. In fact, the spontaneous recovery observed in the recall phase provided us with an additional opportunity to investigate unexpected US omissions, which was our primary focus.</p>

<p>(2) Concerns on reliability of event-based contrasts using three events:</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Regarding concerns about the reliability of analyses based on three events, we believe that the consistency of our parametric modulation analysis— which incorporates all events— combined with the three-event analysis results, provides further support for the observed patterns. We are currently discussing ways of additional analysis for further verification of the reliability of using three events.</p>
