<abstract>
<title>Abstract</title><p>Infectious diseases have affected humanity for millennia and are among the strongest selective forces. Tuberculosis (TB) is an ancient disease, caused by the human-adapted members of the <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> complex (MTBC). The outcome of TB infection and disease is highly variable, and co-evolution between human populations and MTBC strains may account for some of this variability. Particular human genetic ancestries have been associated with higher susceptibility to TB, but socio-demographic aspects of the disease can confound such associations. Here, we studied 1,000 TB patients from Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, together with their respective MTBC isolates, by combining human and bacterial genomics with clinical data. We found that the genetic background of the TB patient population was strongly influenced by migrationsof Bantu-speaking populations from West Africa, which is in contrast to the corresponding MTBC genotypes that were mainly introduced from outside Africa. These findings suggest a recent evolutionary history of co-existence between the human and MTBC populations in Dar es Salaam. We detected no evidence of an effect of human genetic ancestry, or MTBC phylogenetic diversity alone, nor their interaction, on TB disease severity. There was also no evidence of an association between human variation genome-wide and TB disease severity.Treatment-seeking, social and environmental factors are likely to be the main determinants of disease severity at the point of care in this patient population.</p>

<p>Tuberculosis (TB) is an ancient infectious disease that continues to challenge global health efforts. Here, we explored the interplay between human and bacterial genetics on TB in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. We found that neither the genetic ancestry of the patient, nor the bacterial genotype alone, nor their interaction, influenced the severity of TB. Our finding indicate that in this patient population, social and environmental factors may be the main determinants of TB disease severity.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Africa harbors the largest human genetic diversity worldwide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>). This continent is also inhabited by numerous ethnic and linguistic groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>). While the long evolutionary history of modern humans in Africa and their large effective population sizes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>) explain this high genetic diversity, more recent migration events within and from outside Africa during the last 5,000 years, as well as admixture between historically separated populations, have resulted in some degree of homogenization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>). Hence, African populations nowadays are often composed of a mixture of different genetic ancestries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>). One human migration that had a major influence on the population structure of present-day Africans is the so-called ‘Bantu expansion’, where Bantu-speaking groups migrated from central Western Africa southwards and eastwards, spreading farming technologies across sub-Saharan Africa, and admixing with local groups of hunter-gatherers and pastoralists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>). Recent human genetic studies have identified moderate population structuring among Bantu-speaking populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>), yet, admixture with local populations has impacted immune responses to infectious diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>). Since pathogens have been one of the strongest selective forces driving human evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>), disease susceptibility and clinical outcomes can differ markedly between human populations. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified mutations altering the susceptibility to various infectious diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>), including tuberculosis (TB), which remains the main cause of human death due to a single infectious agent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>).</p>
<p>The bacteria that cause TB belong to the <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> complex (MTBC) and can be classified into ten human-adapted phylogenetic lineages: Lineage 1 (L1) to L10, plus several lineages adapted to different wild and domestic animal host species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>). While TB is a global problem, the human-adapted MTBC lineages differ in their geographical distribution. L2 and L4 occur worldwide and other lineages are restricted to specific regions. Specifically, L1 and L3 mainly occur around the Indian Ocean (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>), L5 and L6 that are limited to West Africa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>), and L7 only occurs in Ethiopia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>). This phylogeographic population structure of the human-adapted MTBC led to the hypothesis that certain MTBC genotypes are locally adapted to their sympatric human populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>). This hypothesis is supported by findings from cosmopolitan settings, where sympatric associations between the geographical origin of TB patients and their infecting MTBC strains were observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>). Moreover, in immune-compromised individuals with HIV co-infection, these sympatric associations were disrupted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>). The various MTBC genotypes also differ phenotypically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>), regarding disease progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>), transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>), disease presentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>) and immune activation in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>) and ex vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>).</p>
<p>Human genetic diversity has also been linked to differences in TB susceptibility. While for example <italic>TYK2</italic> has been associated with TB disease worldwide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>), several human genetic loci were not consistently associated with TB in populations from different geographical regions but specific to certain populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>). Particular human genetic ancestries have also been found to play a role in the context of TB. People with higher proportions of native Peruvian genetic ancestry showed a higher risk of progressing to active TB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>), and a higher proportion of San genetic ancestry was associated with an increased risk for TB among South African Coloured individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>). Differences in ethnicity have also been associated with different inflammatory profiles of TB patients at the time of presentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>). In addition to the effects of human and bacterial genetic diversity on TB, many social and environmental factors, as well as co-morbidities are known drivers of TB. These include malnutrition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>), HIV infection, diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>), poverty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>), smoking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>), and alcohol consumption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>).While associations between TB and individual host, pathogen or environmental factors have been found (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>), studies considering all these components simultaneously, remain scarce (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>).</p>
<p>Symptomatic TB has a wide spectrum of severity, and studies conducted before anti-TB drugs became available, suggest that mild disease is associated with higher odds of natural recovery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>). If mortality and natural recovery from symptomatic TB vary depending on the spectrum of disease, conceivably human populations exhibit genetic variation underlying disease severity. Furthermore, given that humans and the MTBC have coexisted for millennia, some of this variation could be linked to human ancestry. Here, we characterized the genetic variation including the genetic ancestry of a cohort of TB patients from Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, the phylogenetic lineage of their correspondent MTBC isolate, and investigated the association of both with TB disease severity while accounting for demographic, social-economical and environmental variables.</p>

<p>The optimal number of source populations to describe our dataset was 24, based on the lowest cross-validation error (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>) (Supplementary Figure S3). For the purpose of this study, we named the genetic ancestries according to the geographical distribution and/or ethnicity of the reference populations that they are most prevalent in. The genetic ancestry with the highest contribution among Tanzanians with a mean of 44% (maximum 68%, minimum 0%) was also the most abundant in Bantu-speaking (BS) people from Southern and southeastern Africa (e.g. the Ronga population in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>), and hence hereafter, we will refer to this ancestry as “Southeastern BS” (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). The second most common genetic ancestry with a mean of 22% (maximum 42%, minimum 6%) in the Tanzanian TB patients was most common among Kenyans (e.g. the Luhya population in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>, 1000G and HGDP, see methods), and will be referred to as the “Eastern BS” genetic ancestry. Additionally, the Tanzanian TB patients had a mean of 9% (maximum 53%, minimum 0%) of a genetic ancestry that was most common among Bantu-speaking populations from western Central Africa, (e.g. the Eviya population in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>); we will refer to it as the “Western BS” genetic ancestry. Furthermore, the Tanzanian TB patients contained on average 4% of a genetic ancestry most abundant among Nigerians represented by the Esan population (“Nigerian” genetic ancestry in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>), and 4% of a genetic ancestry most abundant in people from Chad and Sudan (represented by the Nuba population in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). In addition, the genetic ancestry of the Tanzanian TB patients was composed of 3% of a genetic ancestry most prevalent in people from Western Africa (Gambia and Senegal represented by the Senegal Bedik population, in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>), as well as 3% of a genetic ancestry most prevalent in individuals from western Africa rainforest hunter-gatherer populations (Bezan population in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). A mean of 2% belonged to a genetic ancestry most common among Bedouin individuals (represented by the Yemenite Jew population in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). The proportions of the remaining genetic ancestries were all smaller than 2% (Supplementary Figure S4, admixture plots for all African populations included can be found in Supplementary Figure S5). Finally, most Tanzanian TB patients had little non-African genetic ancestry (mean 5%, maximum 65%), with only 14 patients (∼1%) showing more than 30% non-African genetic ancestry. In summary, the ancestry of Tanzanian TB patients was, for the most part, a mixture of three different Bantu components. Thus, for the remaining sections, we will focus on the ancestries termed Eastern BS (eBS), Southeastern BS (seBS), and Western BS (wBS) .</p>

<title>Insights into the Bantu-speaking genetic ancestries in Africa and Tanzania</title>
<p>Compiling several datasets, including many different BS populations, allowed for a closer look at the distribution of BS ancestries across African populations. Like Tanzanians, the populations from the neighboring Kenya and Mozambique showed strong contributions of BS ancestries resulting from different admixture events (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). While the eBS genetic ancestry was highest in Kenya and Tanzania, decreasing from there to the south and to the west of the continent (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <bold>2</bold>A</xref>), the seBS genetic ancestry generally increased towards the south and decreased towards the west as observed by others (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <bold>2</bold>B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>). The wBS genetic ancestry was mainly seen in BS populations from Gabon and Cameroon, as well as in South African populations (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <bold>2</bold>C</xref>). At a continental-wide level, the geographical distribution and the genetic distances of the human populations analyzed were significantly correlated (Mantel test: veridical correlation = 0.18, p-value &lt; 0.001, Supplementary Figure S6).</p>

<title>The MTBC genotypes circulating in Tanzania and their association with TB disease severity</title>
<p>In previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>), we investigated the MTBC genotypes causing TB in the patient cohort analyzed here. We found a high diversity of MTBC genotypes, with approximately half of the TB cases caused by four main MTBC genotypes estimated to have been introduced into Tanzania starting 320 years ago. After adding the genomic information of an additional 389 MTBC isolates to our dataset (new total N=1,471), the prevalence of the four dominant MTBC genotypes was very similar to our previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>). The most frequent genotype within L3.1.1 (referred to as “Introduction 10”) contributed 39% of the current TB cases, followed by a genotype within L1.1.2 (“Introduction 9”) with 9%, a genotype within L4.3.4 (“Introduction 5”) with 6%, and a genotype within L2.2.1 (“Introduction 1”) with 5%. The remaining TB cases were caused by a variety of other genotypes within L1-L4, but occurred at frequencies of 1% or less (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>).

<title>Relationship between the human and MTBC population structures</title>
<p>We previously found that the four dominant MTBC genotypes in Dar es Salaam differed in their transmission rate and in the duration of the infectious period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>). Here, we assessed whether there might be an additional host genetic contribution to these differences. We first compared the genetic ancestry proportions between patients infected with the four dominant genotypes, and then tested whether patients who were genetically more closely related were infected with MTBC genotypes that were also more closely related as would be expected from a co-evolutionary process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>). However, the human genetic ancestry proportions differed only marginally between the TB patients infected by the four main MTBC genotypes (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Moreover, there was no correlation between the human and bacterial genetic distances (Mantel test: veridical correlation = −0.02, p-value = 0.85). Taken together, we found no statistically significant relationship between the human and bacterial genetic population structure in Dar es Salaam. These results also suggest that the genetic composition of this human population is unlikely to have a measurable effect on the differences in bacterial transmission rate and duration of the infectious period reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>).</p>

<title>Association of human genetic ancestry with TB disease severity</title>
<p>In a previous publication on the same cohort, we found that the bacterial genetic background could not explain the differences observed in TB disease severity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>). Since TB disease is shaped by the bacterial and the human genetic background as well as environmental factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>), we next investigated whether human genetic ancestry could have contributed to the differences in disease severity observed between our TB patients. We assessed the associations between ancestry and the three proxies of TB severity in HIV-negative patients using logistic regression models.. We included the three human genetic ancestries with the highest proportions among the Tanzanian TB patients (seBS, eBS, wBS) as covariates, together with age, sex, smoking, socioeconomic status, TB category (relapse or not), malnutrition, education level, and drug resistance status to control for potential confounding. We found no evidence of an association between human genetic ancestry and any of these three proxies of TB disease severity (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). We repeated the analysis by adding cough duration as covariate to possibly account for the disease duration before recruitment but the results remained unchanged. Additionally, we conducted a genome-wide association study to test for associations between specific human genetic variants and the three proxies of TB disease severity. We included the top three human genetic principal components (PCs), HIV status and the same covariates as for the regression described above. No evidence of an association was found (Supplementary Figure S7).</p>

We only tested L3.1.1-Introduction 10, since the numbers of patients with the other genotypes were too few for meaningful testing.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we analyzed the genetic ancestry of TB patients, the MTBC diversity underlying their TB infection, and estimated the associations of both with disease severity in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. We found a strong component of BS genetic ancestries among the Tanzanian TB patients, similar to those of neighboring populations from Mozambique and Kenya, and little non-African genetic ancestry. Genetic ancestry proportions did not differ between patients infected with different MTBC genotypes. There was no evidence that the patient genetic ancestry or the MTBC genotype on their own, nor their interaction, had any effect on TB disease severity.</p>
<p>Despite the fact that Tanzania is one of the few countries in sub-Saharan Africa where all four main African linguistic groups co-exist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>), and that its largest city and economic capital, Dar es Salaam, is strongly influenced by different human populations from within and outside Africa, our cohort of TB patients mostly comprised BS ethnicities. Comparing this TB patient cohort to a large number of modern human populations revealed major components of eBS and seBS genetic ancestries. This genetic population structure probably resulted from several admixture events estimated to have happened between 1500 to 150 years ago, between local populations and BS populations who migrated from West Africa to the East and South of the continent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>). The TB patients investigated here were recruited in one district hospital of Dar es Salaam. Yet, we found the genetic distances between the patients to be correlated with the original geographic range of their self-identified ethnicities, suggesting that the corresponding human populations are not fully admixed. The population of Dar es Salaam has increased by several millions in the last 40 years, mainly as a result of immigration from rural parts of Tanzania (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>). Thus, our findings suggest that our TB patient population mostly represents recent migrants to Dar es Salaam from other regions of Tanzania. Moreover, we found little evidence of Eurasian genomic influence in the TB patient population (on average 5% genetic ancestry). This is in strong contrast to coastal Swahili populations, as recent findings comparing modern and medieval Swahili people revealed large components of genetic ancestry derived from exchanges between local East African BS populations and people from India, Persia, and Arabia, starting as early as 1000 AD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref>). We conclude that our TB patient population does not represent the full spectrum of human genetic diversity in Tanzania.</p>
<p>In contrast to the genetic ancestry of the TB patients, we found that the MTBC genotypes infecting these patients descend from multiple historical introductions, which mainly resulted from the human exchanges that took place across the Indian Ocean during the last few centuries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>). Some of these recently introduced MTBC genotypes became dominant, in particular the MTBC genotype L3.1.1-Introduction 10, which caused TB in approximately 40% of our patients. These strains descended from an introduction that occurred approximately 300 years ago from South or Central Asia to East-Africa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>). Hence, while our TB patient population reflects little historical gene flow from non-African populations, the underlying MTBC diversity indicates that the MTBC genotypes introduced from outside successfully spread in this newly encountered host population, eventually outcompeting native MTBC genotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref>).</p>
<p>We previously reported that in this TB patient cohort, some of the dominant MTBC genotypes had a higher transmission rate than others, while some other MTBC genotypes induced patients to remain infectious for longer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>). Based on the similar proportions of MTBC genotypes among self-reported ethnic groups we observed at the time, we had already hypothesized that human genetic heterogeneity of the host population is unlikely to be responsible for those differences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>). Here we formally addressed this hypothesis, and found that there was no evidence that the human genetic ancestry proportions differed between patients infected with different MTBC genotypes in our cohort. This finding is consistent with the notion that the differences in epidemiological parameters we reported previously are mainly determined by the pathogen genotype.</p>
<p>Disease severity is one aspect of the clinical presentation of TB with a direct impact on patient mortality and morbidity, as well as on pathogen transmission, as it influences patient infectiousness. It is thus likely that both host and pathogen genetic characteristics can modulate TB disease severity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>). Experimental infections in various animal models suggest that different MTBC strains vary in virulence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref>). However, <italic>in clinico</italic> evidence for differences in disease severity caused by different MTBC genotypes are inconsistent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref>). We found no evidence of differences in disease severity at the point of care caused by the different MTBC genotypes in our study. Moreover, we did not observe any association between human genetic ancestry and disease severity, which is in contrast to a recent study from Peru, where human genetic ancestry was found to influence progression to active TB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>).</p>
<p>Our previous work found evidence of such genetic interactions when considering the complete genomes of the TB patients and their infecting MTBC strain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>), and identified associations between human and pathogen variants. Such associations reflect host-pathogen genetic interactions that determine susceptibility to symptomatic TB or intra-host selection during mycobacterial replication. Here, in the context of co-evolutionary history between humans and MTBC, we specifically tested whether an interaction between the main human ancestry components and being infected with the most dominant MTBC strain in Dar es Salaam could explain the variability in TB disease severity. However, we did not find evidence of such an effect. Others have reported an association between TB disease severity, a particular bacterial genotype and a particular human SNP in Uganda, but did not explicitly link this human SNP to a particular human genetic ancestry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref>). Several factors could account for the lack of effect we observed. First, our patient population was relatively genetically homogeneous, given that the different BS components represent populations with only moderate levels of genetic differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref>). Second, there is likely to be selection bias in our cohort since only patients presenting at the clinic were recruited. The disease severity measures included in this study mainly reflect disease stages at which patients felt ill enough to go to the hospital; i.e. we did not consider intermediate, more contrasting disease states that are known to occur between infection and the development of symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref>). To at least partially account for that, we included the number of weeks a patient was coughing as a covariate in our analyses. Third, the lack of a measurable interaction between host genetic ancestry and MTBC genotype could reflect the relatively recent presence of these MTBC genotypes in Tanzania, and the distinct (i.e. allopatric) geographical origins of the host and pathogen populations. This indicates that none of the ancestral human populations that compose modern Tanzanians has lived in sympatry with the ancestors of the modern MTBC genotypes that circulate in Dar es Salaam today.. With the exception of West Africa, where the geographically restricted West-African MTBC lineages L5 and L6 remain an important cause of human TB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref>), the situation in Tanzania might be representative of the TB epidemics in many African countries, as evidence suggests that many MTBC genotypes dominating the continent today have been introduced from outside Africa recently in the history of human populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">73</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">75</xref>).</p>
<p>In conclusion, our study shows that the TB patients from Dar es Salaam were mainly of BS genetic ancestry reflecting limited Eurasian genetic influx. Neither the human genetic ancestry or the MTBC genotype alone, nor their interaction, were associated with TB disease severity. Our results highlight the dominant role of social and environmental factors in human TB in Tanzania.</p>

Briefly, adult active TB patients with pulmonary disease (sputum smear-positive and GeneXpert-positive) were recruited between November 2013 and June 2022 at the Temeke District Hospital in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania when they first presented for care. Sputum and blood samples were collected from each patient to extract DNA for sequencing of the MTBC strain, and genotyping or whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of the patient. Additionally, clinical and sociodemographic information was obtained from every patient. In total, there was either human or bacterial data available for 1,904 patients. Of those 1,444 patients had human genetic data and 1,471 had bacterial genetic data available, respectively. A total of 1,000 patients had both types of data available after quality-based filtering. The geographical locations of the self-indicated ethnic group of each patient were retrieved by searching for the original region of the respective ethnic group, and if they originated from a single region, the geographic coordinates according to Wikipedia were taken. If two neighboring regions were among the origins, then a random location between the two regions was taken as surrogate (Supplementary Table S1).</p>

<p>The processing of the human genetic data has been described in detail by Xu et al (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>). Briefly, we used the GRCh38 as a human reference genome to map the WGS reads of 118 patients using BWA aligner (v0.7.17) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">77</xref>). Duplicate reads were then marked with the markduplicates module of Picard (v2.8.14) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">78</xref>). Variant calling was first done for each sample individually following GATK best practices for germline short variant discovery. Samples with a coverage below 5 were excluded followed by a joint calling of the variants. A Quality Score Recalibration (VQSR) based filter was applied (real sensitivity of 99.7, excess heterozygosity of 54.69) and samples with more than 50% missing genotype calls were removed.</p>
<p>For the genotyping data, we used the Illumina GenomeStudio software (v2.0.5, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://support.illumina.com/array/array_software/genomestudio/downloads.html">https://support.illumina.com/array/array_software/genomestudio/downloads.html</ext-link>) to analyze the raw microarray data. Samples with a low quality, that were badly clustered, or that had a call rate below 0.97, were excluded. The PLINK format was then converted to VCF format using PLINK (v1.9) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">79</xref>). The first round of imputation was performed with the African Genome Resources (AFGR, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.apcdr.org/">https://www.apcdr.org/</ext-link>) reference panel on the sanger imputation server with EAGLE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">80</xref>) for phasing and Positional Burrows-Wheeler transform (PBWT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">81</xref>) for imputing.

Only reads with a length of at least 20 bp were kept for further analysis. Overlapping paired-end reads were mergend using SeqPrep v. 1.2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">84</xref>) (overlap size = 15).

Picard v. 2.9.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">86</xref>) was then applied to mark and exclude duplicated reads. Furthermore, the RealignerTargetCreator and IndelRealigner modules of GATK v. 3.4.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">87</xref>) were used to perform local realignment of reads around INDELs. Reads having an alignment score lower than (0.93 × read length) – (read length × 4 × × 0.07), corresponding to more than 7 miss-matches per 100bp, were excluded using Pysam v. 0.9.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">88</xref>).

Positions in repetitive regions such as PE, PPE, and PGRS genes or phages were excluded, as described in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">91</xref>). A whole-genome Fasta file was created from the resulting VCF file. We applied some additional filters; genomes were excluded from downstream analysis if they had a sequencing coverage of lower than 15 or if they contained SNPs suggestive of different MTBC lineages (i.e. mixed infections). We identified lineages and sublineages using the SNP-based classification by Steiner et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c92">92</xref>), and Coll et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93">93</xref>), respectively. In addition, we identified drug resistance mutations published in the WHO catalogue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c94">94</xref>) and determined the respective drug resistance profile. The majority of strains were susceptible (95%), while 70 (5%) were isoniazid mono-resistant and two contained isoniazid and rifampicin resistance and were considered as multi-drug resistant.</p>

<title>Identification of bacterial SNPs diagnostic for the successful MTBC introductions</title>
<p>We previously identified several successful MTBC introductions into Dar es Salaam (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>).

By using the R package VariantAnnotation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c95">95</xref>) and a customized Python script, SNPs specific to one of the most successful introductions were extracted. To ensure the SNPs identified as markers for the introductions were specific, we also identified phylogenetic SNPs on a bigger and global dataset representing the human-adapted MTBC diversity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">82</xref>), and tested whether any of the phylogenetic SNPs identified for any of the successful Introductions was present in any of the MTBC lineages or sublineages. We compiled a subset of 25 SNPs (Supplementary Table S2) that we used as phylogenetic markers for the different MTBC introductions and identified strains belonging to one of the four most successful MTBC introductions (Introduction 1, Introduction 5, Introduction 9, and Introduction 10) in the expanded MTBC dataset based on these SNPs by using a customized script.</p>

<p>We used three different proxies for TB disease severity. The first one was the TB-score, which is a clinical score adapted from Wejse et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c96">96</xref>) that consists of several signs and symptoms including the presence of fever and the Body Mass Index (BMI). A point was given for each of the following symptoms or clinical measures if present: BMI below 18, BMI below 16, mid upper arm circumference (MUAC) below 220, MUAC below 200, body temperature higher than 37°C, cough, hemoptysis, dyspnea, chest pain, night sweat, abnormal auscultation, anaemia. A maximum of 12 points could be achieved, and a TB-score below 6 was considered as mild and everything above as severe. As a second proxy, we assessed the amount of lung damage. Two independent radiologists assessed chest X-ray pictures of the patients and gave a Ralph score (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c97">97</xref>). X-ray scores above 71 were considered as severe and everything below as mild. The Ralph score has been validated to grade chest X-ray severity in adult pulmonary TB patients and 71 was the optimal cut-off point for predicting unfavorable outcome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">89</xref>). Furthermore Ralph scores higher than 71 have been associated with a longer duration of symptoms, a lower BMI, and higher clinical scores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c99">99</xref>). As a third proxy we used the bacterial load in the sputum represented by the difference between the first (early cycle) and the last (late cycle) threshold during quantitative PCR (Ct-value) as determined by GeneXpert MTB/RIF assays. For each sputum sample, we took five probes, run a quantitative PCR each and reported the lowest Ct-value.</p>

<title>Genetic ancestry analysis of TB patients</title>
<p>To investigate the genetic ancestry of the TB patients, we combined our dataset with the data from ten other projects: The Gambian Genome Variation Project (GGVP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c100">100</xref>), the 1000 Genomes Project (1000G) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c101">101</xref>), the Human Genome Diversity Project (HGDP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c102">102</xref>), Simons Genome Diversity Project (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c103">103</xref>), as well as data generated by Patin et al. 2014 and 2017 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c104">104</xref>), Hollfelder et al. 2017 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c105">105</xref>), Semo et al. 2019 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>), Schlebusch et al. 2012 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c106">106</xref>), and Fortes-Lima et al. 2022 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c107">107</xref>). We used the GRCh37 version of all datasets. The dataset of HGDP was in GRCh38 version and we thus did a lift over to GRCh37 using the picard (v2.26.10) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">78</xref>) tool LiftoverVcf. For all the datasets including only populations from one single continent, we excluded variants with a missingness of more than 10% and only included variants that did not deviate from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (p &lt; 1e-5) using PLINK (version 1.9b, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.cog-genomics.org/plink/1.9/">www.cog-genomics.org/plink/1.9/</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">79</xref>). For the 1000G, SGDP, and HGDP data, we first identified variants that deviated from the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (p &lt; 1e-5) in each superpopulation using PLINK (version 2.0a, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.cog-genomics.org/plink/2.0/">www.cog-genomics.org/plink/2.0/</ext-link>) and removed them from the whole dataset. We additionally removed variants with a high missingness (&gt; 10%) from the full datasets using PLINK (version 1.9b). After extraction of 103,262 nucleotide positions common to all datasets, we merged the datasets using PLINK (version 1.9b). From the merged dataset, we removed second-degree relatives using PLINK (version 2.0a, king cutoff of 0.088) (N=369) and patients from our cohort where the sex according to the genetic data did not correspond with the sex indicated in the clinical data, patients who were genetic outliers based on principal component analysis (PCA) or who did not cluster with any other African samples (N=83). In addition, we removed regions of high linkage disequilibrium (https://genome.sph.umich.edu/wiki/Regions_of_high_linkage_disequilibrium_(LD)) and applied additional filters to the merged dataset (missingness &gt; 10%, minimum allele frequency of 5%, removal of sex chromosomes, variant pruning with –indep-pairwise 50 10 0.1, only biallelic positions) ending up with 53,255 positions and 7,479 individuals from 249 populations.</p>
<p>To infer the ancestry proportions of the Tanzanian TB patients, we used ADMIXTURE (version 1.3.0) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>). We estimated the number of ancestral populations (K) by running ADMIXTURE 15 times for each value for K from K=2 until K=29 with the option --cv. The - -cv option performs 5-fold cross-validation and allows to identify the value for K resulting in the lowest cross-validation error (Supplementary Figure S3). The cross-validation error was lowest for K = 24. From the 15 runs performed with K = 24, we selected a representative of an output that was supported by most of the 15 runs (6/15) to extract the ancestry proportions of each individual. A PCA was performed using PLINK (version 1.9b) on all African populations included.</p>

<sec id="s4h">
<title>Spatial interpolation of human genetic ancestry proportions</title>
<p>To visualize the distributions of the different patient ancestries, we performed spatial interpolation using the OrdinaryKriging function from the pykrige module in Python (variogram_model = “linear”, grid space of 500). For the eBS and seBS ancestries, we included all African populations for the interpolation. For the wBS, the interpolation failed when using all African populations with an insufficient slope, suggesting little spatial variability. Since many populations were sampled in the region with the highest proportions of wBS genetic ancestry and among them many hunter-gatherer populations containing little to no wBS genetic ancestry, we repeated the interpolation with only a subset of the non-hunter-gatherer populations.</p>

<sec id="s4i">
<title>Correlation between distance matrices</title>
<p>To assess, whether MTBC genotypes that are more closely related tend to infect people that are also more closely related genetically which would be compatible with co-evolution, we investigated the correlation between the human and bacterial distance matrices. To calculate the pairwise bacterial genetic distances, alignments of variable positions where data was missing in less than 10% of the genomes were generated and used to create SNP distance matrices according to the Hamming distance (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://git.scicore.unibas.ch/TBRU/tacos">https://git.scicore.unibas.ch/TBRU/tacos</ext-link>).</p>
<p>Insertions and deletions were considered as missing data. To get the human pairwise genetic distances, we calculated the Euclidean distance based on the first two principal components. When only looking at the Tanzanian TB patients, we calculated the principal components for the Tanzanians only while for the continental dataset we included all available African populations.</p>
<p>To investigate, whether human populations that are geographically more distant are also genetically more distant, we calculated the correlation between the geographical and the genetic distance on an African level as well as on the level of Tanzania. For the geographical distance matrix, we calculated the Euclidean distance based on the latitude and the longitude. At the level of Tanzania, the broad geographic location of the original area of the ethnic group was considered (Supplementary Table S1) and for the continental level, the coordinates of the hospital in Temeke were taken for the Tanzanian TB patients considering that for the other studies only the sampling locations were known. The human and bacterial genetic distance matrices as well as the human genetic and geographic distance matrices were tested for correlations using the mantel.test() function from the mantel module in Python (options: perms = 10000, method = “pearson”, tail = “upper”).</p>

<title>Statistical analyses</title>
<p>Clinical and sociodemographic characteristics, MTBC genotype as well as human genetic ancestry were summarized by the different disease severity measures using proportions or means and standard deviations. Similarly, the human genetic ancestries were summarized by MTBC genotype.</p>
<p>To estimate the associations between disease severity and the explanatory variables bacterial genotype (binary, belonging to Introduction 10 or not) and human ancestries (seBS, eBS, wBS), we used a logistic regression model. We included three variables as proxies for disease severity: Lung damage based on X-ray score (mild versus severe), TB-score (mild versus severe), bacterial load (continuous, log10 transformed).Categorization or transformation of the disease severity measures were performed because the distributions of the residues were not normal, violating the assumption of linear regression. We tested only for Introduction 10 because there were few observations of the other MTBC genotypes. To account for the compositional nature of the human ancestries (i.e. that they sum up to 1), we used the additive log transformation from the R package ‘compositions’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c108">108</xref>). The ancestry proportions were transformed and categorized with category 1 comprising the lowest amount of the respective ancestry and category 3 (4 in the case of wBS) the highest. The categories were chosen to have roughly equal numbers of patients in each. We used categories to allow a non-linear relationship without specifying polynomials, and avoid having difficulty in interpretation but we recognize that a small amount of information is lost. Similar results were also obtained with other parameterizations. We assessed whether there was an interaction between ancestry and genotype on TB severity using the likelihood ratio test. For that, we compared a model including the interaction between the MTBC genotype and human genetic ancestry to a model without the interaction using the ‘lmtest’ package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c109">109</xref>). The estimates were adjusted for: age, sex, smoking, the number of weeks with cough, the socioeconomic status (ratio between household income and number of household members), education (no, primary, secondary, university), drug resistance profile, TB category (new infection or relapse/reinfection), and malnutrition. Only HIV-negative patients were included in the analysis. All statistical analyses were carried out in R (version 4.1.2). Code for the statistical analysis can be found (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/mzwyer/TB-Dar_Mtb">https://github.com/mzwyer/TB-Dar_Mtb</ext-link>).</p>
<p>To conduct the genome-wide association study (GWAS), we used logistic regression (TB Score, X-ray Score) and a linear model (Ct-value) implemented by PLINK (version 1.9). A total of 6,665,541 common (MAF &gt; 0.05) human genetic variants were included. Genetic principal components were calculated using GCTA (version 1.93.2). As covariates, we included the top three human genetic principal components (PCs) to correct for population stratification, along with sex, HIV status, age, cough duration, smoking, socioeconomic status, TB category, malnutrition, education, and drug resistance profile. Genomic inflation factors were below 1 of all tested outcomes (Supplementary Figure S9).</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This Tanzanian study focused on the relationship between human genetic ancestry, Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC) diversity, and tuberculosis (TB) disease severity. The authors analyzed the genetic ancestry of 1,444 TB patients and genotyped the corresponding MTBC strains isolated from the same individuals. They found that the study participants predominantly possess Bantu-speaking genetic ancestry, with minimal European and Asian ancestry. The MTBC strains identified were diverse and largely resulted from introductions from South or Central Asia. Unfortunately, no associations were identified between human genetic ancestry, the MTBC strains, or TB severity. The authors suggest that social and environmental factors are more likely to contribute to TB severity in this setting.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>In comparison to other studies investigating the role of human genetics in TB phenotypes, this study is relatively large, with more than 1,400 participants.</p>
<p>The matched human-MTBC strain collection is valuable and offers the opportunity to address questions about human-bacterium co-evolution.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Although the authors had genome-wide genotyping and whole genome sequencing data, they only compared the associations between human ancestry and MTBC strains. Given the large sample size, they had the opportunity to conduct a genome-wide association study similar to that of Muller et al. (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ygeno.2021.04.024">https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ygeno.2021.04.024</ext-link>).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you very much for taking the time to carefully review our manuscript and for your suggestions and comments. In another published study using the same cohort (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.05.11.23289848">https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.05.11.23289848</ext-link>), we performed a genome-wide association analysis between the genome-wide SNPS of the host and the genome-wide SNPs from the paired MTBC strains. In the current work we were interested in testing specifically if host ancestry and pathogen genotype family, as well as their interaction, were associated with differences in disease severity, a clinical phenotype with direct consequences for both host and pathogen fitness. The study of Müller et al, referred to by the reviewer, investigates whether MTBC families of strains causing disease in two patient cohorts (South Africa and Ghana) were associated with particular human SNPS assessed genome-wide. In that study, clinical phenotypes were not assessed and human ancestries, in a much broader sense than the ones used in our current study, were used as covariates. To leverage the genome-wide information and the clinical variables collected in our study, we have now added a genome-wide association analysis of all the human SNPs with disease severity measures while adjusting for co-variates (age, sex,  smoking, cough duration, socioeconomic status, history of previous TB, malnutrition, education level, and drug resistance status) and for human population stratification . Yet, no significant statistical associations were detected (L243-249).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The authors tested whether human genetic ancestry is associated with TB severity. However, the basis for this hypothesis is unclear. The studies cited as examples all focused on progression to active TB (from a latent infection state), which should not be conflated with disease severity. It is difficult to ascertain whether the role of genetic ancestry in disease severity would be detectable through this study design, as some participants might simply have been sicker for longer before being diagnosed (despite the inquiry about cough duration). This delay in diagnosis would not be influenced solely by human genetics, which is the conclusion of the study.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Evidence that mortality and natural recovery from TB vary by disease presentation spectrum come from studies carried out before the introduction of anti-TB chemotherapy. Patients with mild disease presentation, as measured by radiology at the time of diagnosis had higher odds of recovering naturally compared to those with advanced disease (doi: 10.5588/ijtld.23.0254, doi: 10.1164/arrd.1960.81.6.839). Given the deleterious effects of an MTBC infection leading to symptomatic disease on human fitness, we hypothesized that natural selection has acted on human traits underlying TB disease severity. If those traits are heritable one would expect to find underlying genetic variation in human populations. In addition, because certain MTBC genotype families and human populations have co-existed since a least a few centuries to a few millennia, we hypothesized that some of that genetic variation could be related to human ancestry. We have added more details to the introduction to make our rational clearer (L118-127).  In our patient cohort, we observed a large variation in disease severity using as approximations; TB-Score, X-Ray score and bacterial burden in sputa (Ct-value as determined with GeneXpert). However, the reviewer is absolutely correct in that patients in our study are being diagnosed at different stages of disease confounding our analysis. This is a limitation of our study which cannot be fully accounted for by including cough duration, as we also acknowledged in the manuscript (L343-346).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Additionally, the study only included participants who attended the TB clinic.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Yes, this is related to the previous point, our study only considers patients that felt ill enough to visit the TB clinic potentially not including patients that had less severe disease as acknowledged.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Including healthy controls from the general population would have provided an interesting comparison to see if ancestry proportions differ.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree that it would be interesting to compare the ancestries of healthy controls to the ancestries of TB patients from the same population. However, that would be especially informative with respect to TB susceptibility and would not necessarily be informing disease severity traits and its underlying genetics. The similarities between the ancestry proportions of our cohort with those of neighboring countries such as Kenya, Malawi and Mozambique publicly available genomic data, suggests that there would be no major differences between TB patients and healthy controls.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Although the authors suggest that social and environmental factors contribute to TB severity, only age, smoking, and HIV status were characterised in the study.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Based on the comments of both reviewers, we added the following additional variables as covariates in the regression models: the socioeconomic status representing the ratio between the household income and the number of individuals in the household, malnutrition, the education level and whether it was a relapse/reinfection or a new case.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This manuscript reports the results of an observational study conducted in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, investigating potential associations between genetic variation in M. tuberculosis and human host vs. disease severity. The headline finding is that no such associations were found, either for host / bacillary genetics as main effects or for interactions between them.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Strengths of the study include its large size and rigorous approaches to classification of genetic diversity for host and bacillus.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) There are some limitations of the disease severity read-outs employed: X-ray scores and Xpert cycle thresholds from sputum analysis can only take account of pulmonary disease. CXR is an insensitive approach to assessing 'lung damage', especially when converted to a binary measure. What was the basis for selection of Ralph score of 71 to dichotomise patients? If outcome measures were analysed as continuous variables, would this have been more sensitive in capturing associations of interest?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you very much for taking the time to carefully review our manuscript and for your suggestions and comments.</p>
<p>We recruited active TB patients with pulmonary TB disease that were sputum smear-positive and GeneXpert-positive. In this study we aimed at obtaining paired samples from both the patient and the strain, and in the current analysis we aimed at testing if human ancestry and its interaction with the strain genotype could explain differences in disease severity. It is often difficult to obtain microbiological cultures from extra-pulmonary cases and including those cases would have not been possible at the scale of this cohort. We believe as well that extra-pulmonary TB is of less relevance for the question we are addressing because in exclusively extrapulmonary cases, disease severity is not linked with bacterial transmission. However, extra-pulmonary TB can be extremely severe, and it would be very interesting to explore the potential role of human genetic variation underlying extra-pulmonary TB in future studies.</p>
<p>As to the insensitivity of CXR to measure lung damage, we would argue that it depends on what is being assed. As a rationale for the Ralph score, its inventors argue that as in other grading methods, the proportion of affected lung and or cavitation is important to assess severity. It has been described as a “validated method for grading CXR severity in adults with smear-positive pulmonary TB that correlates with baseline clinical and microbiological severity and response to treatment, and is suitable for use in clinical trials” (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://thorax.bmj.com/content/thoraxjnl/65/10/863.full.pdf">https://thorax.bmj.com/content/thoraxjnl/65/10/863.full.pdf</ext-link>). While the validation of the score is convincing in that study, and the score has been used in several TB studies and trials, the low proportion of HIV co-infections might have been a limitation. Indeed, as shown in our previous publication, in our cohort of patients, chest X-ray scores were significantly lower in HIV infected TB patients <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1010893">https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1010893</ext-link>. In the current analysis, regression analyses performed for the CXR severity and for the other severity measures did not include HIV co-infected patients.</p>
<p>We obtained the same pattern of results using a continuous outcome. However, an assumption of linear regression was violated. The residuals were not normally distributed stemming from the bimodal distribution of the scores in our dataset. The threshold of 71 for the Ralph score has been used by others in previous studies; in its original description it has been suggested as the optimal cut-off point for predicting a positive sputum smear status after two months, which in turn has been shown to predict unfavorable outcomes (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1136/thx.2010.136242">https://doi.org/10.1136/thx.2010.136242</ext-link>). Another study showed that a Ralph score higher than 71 was significantly associated with a longer duration of symptoms, higher clinical scores and a lower BMI (doi: 10.5603/ARM.2018.0032).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) There is quite a lot of missing data, especially for TB scores - could this have introduced bias? This issue should be mentioned in the discussion.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>While we have a TB-score available for each patient, the chest X-ray score is missing for many patients. However, this is random and due both to the absence of an X-ray picture or to the bad quality of X-ray pictures that the radiologists could not assess. When stating that there is a lot of missing data for the TB scores, we assume that the reviewer was referring to the “missing N” columns in Table 1. There, the number of observations missing in each of the disease severity measures actually relates to the explanatory variables (i.e MTBC genotype and human ancestries). This table includes all patients that either had a bacterial genome available or a human genome/genotype (N = 1904). As an example for the TB-score as outcome variable, for 1471 patients the MTBC genotype was determined while it was missing for 433 patients. On the other hand for X-ray scores, 177 had a severe X-ray score, 849 a mild one and for 878 patients, there was no X-ray score available.  As for the Ct-value, despite the fact that the patients were recruited based on positive GeneXpert by the clinical team, these results were not always available to us.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) The analysis adjusted for age, sex, HIV status, age, smoking and cough duration - but not for socio-economic status. This will likely be a major determinant of disease severity. Was adjustment made for previous TB (i.e. new vs repeat episode) and drug-sensitivity of the isolate? Cough duration will effectively be a correlate/consequence of more severe disease - thus likely highly collinear with disease severity read-outs - not a true confounder. How does removal of this variable from the model affect results? Data on socioeconomic status should be added to models, or if not possible then lack of such data should be noted as a limitation.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Out of the 1904 patients that have either human or bacterial genomic data available, 48 were relapses (2.5%). The mean of the disease severity measures suggest that relapses have a higher CXR score but the TB-score and Ct-values did not differ. Based on the comments of both reviewers, we added the following additional variables as covariates to the regression models: the socioeconomic status representing the ratio between the household income and the number of individuals in the household, malnutrition examined by a doctor, the education level, and whether it was a relapse/reinfection or a new case and if the causative strain had any resistance to any anti-TB drugs. The results did not change. Cough duration could also be a consequence of more severe disease, as pointed out by the reviewer. We present now the results excluding cough duration as a variable from the model, however this also did not affect the results.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) Recruitment at hospitals may have led to selection bias due to exclusion of less severe, community cases. The authors already acknowledge this limitation in the Discussion however.</p>
<p>(5) Introduction: References refer to disease susceptibility, but the authors should also consider the influences of host/pathogen genetics on host response - both in vitro (PMIDs 11237411, 15322056) and in vivo (PMID 23853590). The last of these studies encompassed a broader range of ethnic variation than the current study, and showed associations between host ancestry and immune response - null results from the current study may reflect the relative genetic homogeneity of the population studied.</p>
