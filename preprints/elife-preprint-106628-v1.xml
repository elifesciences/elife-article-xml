<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Extracting relevant auditory signals from complex natural scenes is a fundamental challenge for the auditory system. Sounds from multiple sources overlap in time and frequency. In particular, dynamic “fore-ground” sounds are often masked by more stationary “background” sounds. Human auditory cortex exhibits a hierarchical organization where background-invariant representations are progressively enhanced along the processing stream, from primary to non-primary regions. However, we do not know whether this organizational principle is conserved across species and which neural mechanisms drive this invariance. To address these questions, we investigated background invariance in ferret auditory cortex using functional ultrasound imaging (fUSI), which enables large-scale, high-resolution recordings of hemodynamic responses. We measured responses across primary, secondary, and tertiary auditory cortical regions as ferrets passively listened to mixtures of natural sounds and their components in isolation. We found a hierarchical gradient of background invariance, mirroring findings in humans: responses in primary auditory cortex reflected contributions from both foreground and background sounds, while background invariance increased in higher-order auditory regions. Using a spectrotemporal filter-bank model, we found that in ferrets, this hierarchical structure could be largely explained by tuning to low-order acoustic features. However, this model failed to fully account for background invariance in human non-primary auditory cortex, suggesting that additional, higher-order mechanisms are crucial for background segregation in humans.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In the intricate auditory landscapes of our surroundings, the brain quickly extracts meaningful information from a cacophony of overlapping sources. Humans are remarkably good at detecting speech in complex noise: two people in a bar can easily have a conversation despite the ambient chatter. This ability is thought to rely on the different properties of background and foreground sounds, which are mixed in a single wave-form at the level of the cochlea. Dynamic “foreground” sounds, such as speech or vocalizations, fluctuate over short timescales, and these fluctuations convey new information over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Singh &amp; Theunissen, 2003</xref>). In contrast, stationary “background” sounds, like ambient chatter or the rustle of wind, fluctuate over longer periods, and are thus more predictable and less vital for signaling sudden events. They can be synthesized realistically based solely on their time-averaged acoustic statistics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">McWalter &amp; McDermott, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">McDermott &amp; Simoncelli, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">McWalter &amp; Dau, 2017</xref>), which the brain uses to perceptually fill short acoustic gaps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">McWalter &amp; McDermott, 2019</xref>). Despite these differences in the nature of foreground and background sounds, we still lack a general understanding of where background invariance occurs in the brain and what neural mechanisms underlie it.</p>
<p>In humans, multiple stages of processing build up background-invariant representations. In fMRI recordings of auditory cortex, non-primary areas are more background-invariant than primary areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Kell &amp; McDermott, 2019</xref>). In addition, intracranial cortical responses show rapid adaptation to new background noise, which improves representations of foreground speech (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Khalighinejad et al., 2019</xref>). This effect is stronger for neurons in non-primary auditory cortex. This progressive invariance is unlikely to be fully explained by the parallel hierarchical organization of speech and music processing in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Norman-Haignere et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Norman-Haignere &amp; McDermott, 2018</xref>), since it is still present when excluding speech and music from foreground sounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Kell &amp; McDermott, 2019</xref>). Moreover, background invariance appears to be independent of selective attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Kell &amp; McDermott, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Khalighinejad et al., 2019</xref>). Thus, the hierarchical organization of background invariance may not be specific to humans but rather a generic principle shared with other animals.</p>
<p>Background invariance can also be found in non-human animals. In fact, neurons that exhibit background-invariant responses are present throughout the auditory pathway in multiple species, increasingly from subcortical nuclei to the auditory cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Souffi et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Rabinowitz et al., 2013</xref>). Background-invariant representations in auditory cortex are necessary for behavioral discrimination of natural sounds in noise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Town et al., 2023</xref>). Neurons with foreground-invariant responses are also found in the non-human auditory cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Bar-Yosef, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Ni et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Hamersky et al., 2023</xref>), but a critical transformation of representations within the cortical hierarchy could specifically enhance foreground representations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Schneider &amp; Woolley, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Saderi et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Carruthers et al., 2015</xref>). However, these studies differ by species, regions, state (awake vs. anesthetized), type of background noise (synthetic vs. natural) and signal-to-noise ratio. Thus, it remains unclear whether a cortical gradient in background invariance, as seen in humans, is present in other animals.</p>
<p>Mechanistically, background invariance could come from the simple tuning properties of neurons. Auditory cortical neurons are known to be tuned to frequency and spectrotemporal modulations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Miller et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Shamma, 2009</xref>), which are acoustic features that differ between background and foreground sounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Elie &amp; Theunissen, 2015</xref>). In ferrets, this low-level spectrotemporal tuning can explain large-scale responses to natural sounds in both primary and non-primary regions of auditory cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Landemard et al., 2021</xref>). Thus, differences in background invariance across regions could result from regional differences in such low-order tuning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Moore et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Ivanov et al., 2022</xref>). In humans, this tuning can explain responses in primary auditory cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Santoro et al., 2014</xref>), but not in non-primary fields (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Norman-Haignere &amp; McDermott, 2018</xref>). Consequently, the sensitivity of human non-primary cortex to acoustic high-order acoustic features may underlie the hierarchical gradient in background invariance. However, it remains untested whether background invariance in the auditory cortex relies on neural mechanisms that are conserved across species.</p>
<p>Here, we asked (1) whether background invariance is hierarchically organized in the auditory cortex of a non-human mammal, ferret, and (2) whether hierarchical background invariance could be explained by tuning to low-order acoustic properties that differentiate foreground-like and background-like natural sounds. We defined foreground and background sounds based on an acoustic criterion of stationarity. We measured large-scale hemodynamic responses in ferret auditory cortex as ferrets passively listened to isolated and combined foregrounds and backgrounds. Leveraging the spatial resolution and coverage of functional ultrasound imaging (fUSI), we showed that background invariance increased from primary to secondary and tertiary areas of auditory cortex. We could predict these effects using a model based on frequency and spectrotemporal modulations, suggesting that the organization of background invariance in the ferret brain can be derived from neural spectrotemporal tuning. Finally, we showed that the same model could not explain as well the patterns of background invariance found in human auditory cortex, suggesting that additional mechanisms underlie background invariance in humans.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Using functional ultrasound imaging (fUSI), we measured hemodynamic responses in the auditory cortex of ferrets passively listening to continuous streams of natural sounds. We used three types of stimuli: fore-grounds, backgrounds, and combinations of those. To define foregrounds and backgrounds, we computed each sound’s stationarity, defined as the stability in time of a sound’s acoustic statistics (McWalter &amp; Mc-Dermott, 2018). Backgrounds were chosen as the most stationary and foregrounds as the least stationary sounds (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>, table 1). Different sound segments were concatenated to form continuous streams (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). In the isolated condition, a sound change occurred every 9.6 seconds. In the mixture condition, the same sequences overlapped with a lag of 4.8 s between the foreground and background streams, leading to a change in one or the other stream every 4.8 s.</p>

<p>Hemodynamic responses stably encoded sound identity after transient responses. We continuously measured hemodynamic activity in ferret auditory cortex (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>) throughout the sound sequences and normalized cerebral blood volume (CBV) relative to blocks of silent baseline. Sound changes elicited transient increases in activity before reaching a sustained level (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>). Sustained activity was lower for backgrounds in isolation than for foregrounds and mixtures. We asked whether sound encoding was stable over time despite these changes in amplitude. We focused on the sound-specific activity of responsive voxels (ΔCBV &gt; 2.5%) by subtracting their average timecourse across all sounds in each category. For each voxel, we cross-correlated vectors of responses to sounds of each category across two repetitions (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>). Voxels stably encoded sounds of each category throughout their duration despite the observed variation in response amplitude. Thus, we summarized voxels’ activity by their time-averaged activity over an interval spanning 2 to 4.8 s after sound change.</p>

<title>Invariance to background sounds is hierarchically organized in ferret auditory cortex</title>
<p>We investigated the spatial organization of sound responses throughout the whole ferret auditory cortex. We found that reliable sound-evoked responses were not homogeneous but confined to the central part of ventral gyrus of the auditory cortex (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A, B</xref>). Hereafter, We focused on reliable sound-responsive voxels (test-retest correlation &gt; 0.3 for sounds in at least one condition). We assigned voxels to three regions of interest in ferret auditory cortex (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>): MEG (primary), dPEG (secondary) and VP (tertiary, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Elgueda et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Landemard et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Radtke-Schuller, 2018</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>Invariance to background sounds was stronger in non-primary than in primary auditory cortex. To probe invariance to background sounds for each voxel, we compared responses to mixtures and isolated foregrounds across sound segments (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>). Responses to mixtures and isolated foregrounds tended to be more similar for voxels in non-primary regions. We quantified this effect by computing a noise-corrected version of the Pearson correlation between responses to mixtures and foregrounds for each voxel, which we call background invariance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Kell &amp; McDermott, 2019</xref>). Background invariance emerged shortly after a sound change and was stable throughout the duration of each sound snippet (Figure S1). When going up the hierarchy, correlations between mixtures and foregrounds increased (tertiary (VP) &gt; secondary (dPEG) &gt; primary (MEG), <italic>p</italic> = 0.001 with a permutation test, see table 2 for detailed statistics), indicating a stronger invariance to background sounds in higher-order areas, especially in VP (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2E, F</xref>, figure S2).</p>
<p>To test whether foregrounds were processed differently than backgrounds, and at which stage, we also compared responses to mixtures and backgrounds in isolation. We defined a “foreground invariance”, symmetric to the background invariance, by correlating responses to mixtures and isolated backgrounds across sound segments (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2G</xref>). In primary auditory cortex (MEG), there was no significant difference between values of foreground invariance and background invariance (<italic>p</italic> = 0.063, obtained by randomly permuting the sounds’ background and foreground labels, 1000 times). However, foreground invariance tended to decrease from primary to non-primary areas (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2H, I</xref>, VP &lt; dPEG: <italic>p</italic> = 0.001, dPEG &lt; MEG: <italic>p</italic> = 0.136 with a permutation test). As a consequence, foreground invariance became lower than background invariance in both dPEG (<italic>p</italic> = 0.001) and VP (<italic>p</italic> = 0.001).</p>

<title>A model of auditory processing predicts hierarchical differences</title>
<p>By definition, foregrounds and backgrounds are separated in the acoustic domain. Low-level acoustic features computed from their waveforms can well discriminate both categories. To show this, we used a standard two-stage filter-bank model of auditory processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Chi et al., 2005</xref>). This model (1) computes a sound’s cochleagram, (2) convolves the resulting cochleagram through a bank of spectrotemporal modulation filters, tuned to a range of frequencies and spectrotemporal modulations (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). Foregrounds and backgrounds differed in their pattern of energy in the modulation space (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B, C</xref>). In particular, the axis of temporal modulation was highly discriminative: foregrounds tended to have higher energy in the low rates (&lt; 8 Hz), and backgrounds in higher rates (&gt; 8 Hz).</p>

</fig>
<p>In ferret auditory cortex, large-scale cortical responses to natural sounds are well predicted by the spectrotemporal model, even when controlling for stimuli correlations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Landemard et al., 2021</xref>). To test whether differences in neural invariance could be explained by tuning to low-order acoustic features, we predicted the voxels’ responses using this model. We derived voxels weights for model features using cross-validated ridge regression of trial-averaged responses to all sounds (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D, E</xref>).</p>
<p>Tuning to frequency and spectrotemporal modulations showed large-scale spatial structure. Through the model weights, we first explored whether tuning to acoustic features was topographically organized. We extracted the voxels’ preferred frequency, spectral and temporal modulations by marginalizing over the other features. We retrieved the tonotopic organization of the auditory cortex, confirming our anatomical segmentation into functional areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Elgueda et al., 2019</xref>). The voxels’ preferred spectral and temporal modulations were also spatially organized (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref>, figure S3 for all ferrets). To directly examine the differences of tuning between non-primary and primary areas, we computed the differences in weights between Dpeg vs. MEG and VP vs. MEG, throughout the whole three-dimensional acoustic space (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3G</xref>). The weights of voxels in non-primary areas differed from those in primary areas in a complex manner, in contrast to the simple separation of the acoustic space between foregrounds and backgrounds (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>). Compared to MEG, dPEG was preferentially tuned to high frequencies and higher spectral modulations (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3G</xref> top), while VP tuning was biased towards low frequencies and intermediate spectrotemporal modulations (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3G</xref> bottom).</p>
<p>We sought to assess whether these differences in tuning underlaid differences in background in-variance across regions. Since the temporal modulation axis was the most informative to discriminate foregrounds from backgrounds (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>), we first compared the invariance properties of voxels tuned to low or high temporal modulation rates. Within each region, voxels tuned to lower modulation rates displayed higher background invariance and lower foreground invariance than those tuned to higher rates (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3H</xref>, <italic>p &lt;</italic> 0.002 within each ROI by permuting voxels’ tuning, 2000 times). However, within each tuning group, differences were still present across regions (primary vs. non-primary, <italic>p</italic> = 0.001 within voxels tuned to high rates and within voxels tuned to low rates, see table 2 for more detailed comparisons between regions), confirming that tuning to temporal modulation was not the only mechanism at play.</p>
<p>To take into account tuning across all dimensions, we then directly looked at the invariance of responses predicted from the spectrotemporal model. The model was able to predict voxel responses accurately (Figure S5) and recapitulated invariance properties across single voxels (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A-C, E-G</xref>). To verify how well the model could explain the observed invariance, we directly compared measured and predicted invariance across voxels for each animal, regardless of ROI (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C, G</xref>). Predictions explained a large fraction of the reliable variability in background invariance (mean noise-corrected correlation between measured and predicted invariance: <italic>r</italic> = 0.65 <italic>±</italic> 0.007 standard error of the mean across animals) and foreground invariance (mean <italic>r</italic> = 0.43 <italic>±</italic> 0.04). Predicted responses recapitulated the gradient from primary to non-primary areas for background invariance (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>; MEG &lt; dPEG, <italic>p</italic> = 0.022; dPEG &lt; VP, <italic>p</italic> = 0.001, permutation test) and foreground invariance (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4H</xref>; MEG &gt; dPEG: <italic>p</italic> = 0.014, dPEG &gt; VP: <italic>p</italic> = 0.001, permutation test). Thus, hierarchical differences in invariance were largely explained by differences in tuning to frequency and spectrotemporal modulation between regions.</p>

<title>Species difference in background invariance</title>
<p>In ferrets, background invariance is hierarchically organized, and this organization can largely be explained by simple spectrotemporal tuning. Is it also the case for the humans’ hierarchical organization of invariance? To test this, we compared background invariance previously obtained in humans with what we found in ferrets. We used a comparable published dataset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Kell &amp; McDermott, 2019</xref>), in which combinations of foregrounds and backgrounds were presented to human subjects, in isolation and in mixtures.

<p>We next tested whether the spectrotemporal model could predict human voxel responses. The model performed similarly in humans and ferrets (Figure S5, <italic>r</italic> = 0.42 <italic>±</italic> 0.01 standard error of the mean across subjects, humans vs ferrets: <italic>p</italic> = 0.0667, Wilcoxon rank-sum test). However, the model explained less of the measured background invariance in humans than in ferrets (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>, noise-corrected correlation between measured and predicted invariance: <italic>r</italic> = 0.23 <italic>±</italic> 0.04, <italic>p</italic> = 0.0167 compared to ferrets, <italic>p</italic> = 0.0156 compared to 0, Wilcoxon rank-sum test). While predicted background invariance differed significantly between primary and non-primary regions (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref>, primary &lt; non-primary, <italic>p</italic> = 0.001, permutation test), the predicted difference was much smaller than observed. Furthermore, the model failed to predict the levels of foreground invariance in both primary and non-primary human auditory cortex (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5H, I</xref>, noise-corrected correlation between measured and predicted invariance: <italic>r</italic> = <italic>−</italic>0.17 <italic>±</italic> 0.06, <italic>p</italic> = 0.0167 compared to ferrets, <italic>p</italic> = 0.0312 compared to 0, Wilcoxon rank-sum test). Thus, the spectrotemporal model performed worse in explaining the patterns of cortical invariance in humans than in ferrets. This suggests that additional higher-order mechanisms contribute to background segregation in humans.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this work, we investigated large-scale background and foreground invariance in auditory cortex, using mixtures of natural sounds. In ferrets, we found a hierarchical gradient of invariance, where primary cortical areas encode both background and foreground sounds, while non-primary regions show increasing invariance to background sounds. A spectrotemporal filter-bank model could account for a large portion of the hierarchical changes in ferrets, suggesting that low-level tuning to frequency and modulation properties explain how stationary “background” and more dynamic “foreground” signals are segregated in hemodynamic signal. When we applied the same model to human data, we found that although humans also display a hierarchical increase in background invariance, the model failed to capture a substantial fraction of the observed effect in non-primary regions. This suggests that mechanisms beyond simple spectrotemporal tuning are at play in human auditory cortex.</p>
<p>Our results show that foregrounds and backgrounds are similarly represented in primary auditory cortex, both in ferrets and humans; at this stage, we found no bias towards foregrounds. This is in line with previous work in non-human animals, including birds, where neurons in various regions up to primary auditory cortex display a continuum of background-invariant and foreground-invariant responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Ni et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Bar-Yosef, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Schneider &amp; Woolley, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Hamersky et al., 2023</xref>). This diversity of responses may play a functional role in background denoising. Studies show complex synergetic interactions between target sounds and background noise in primary auditory cortex, even with simple stimuli. On the one hand, white noise can sharpen neurons’ tuning curves, enhancing tone discrimination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Christensen et al., 2019</xref>), and improve the representations of frequency sweeps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Malone et al., 2017</xref>). On the other hand, background information can be more easily decoded from population responses when presented with a target sound than when in isolation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Malone et al., 2017</xref>). Computationally, background-related information could facilitate further extraction of foregrounds. For instance, in a convolutional neural network trained to recognize digits in noise, when local feedback is implemented, early layers encode background properties, while later layers represent clean signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Lindsay et al., 2022</xref>). Similarly, primary auditory areas could be recruited to maintain background representations, enabling downstream cortical regions to use these representations to specifically suppress background information and enhance foreground representations.</p>
<p>We found that the main difference regarding background invariance between humans and ferrets was in how well invariance could be explained by a model based on low-level acoustic features. There could be multiple reasons for this difference.</p>
<p>First, methodological differences could weigh in the observed species difference. In our ferret experiment, sounds were presented continuously and in longer segments, an experimental design enabled by fUSI but impractical for fMRI due to scanner noise. However, this is unlikely to have a major impact, as our analyses focused on the sustained response component, similar to the fMRI experiment. Furthermore, while fUSI and fMRI both provide hemodynamic signals, they differ in their physiological basis (CBV vs. BOLD). Studies comparing CBV-weighted and BOLD fMRI indicate that the CBV signal provides a more spatially and temporally precise than BOLD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Silva et al., 2007</xref>), improving localization of neural activity. In addition, fUSI provides a higher spatial resolution than classical fMRI (100 <italic>μ</italic>m against ~2 mm voxel size). Thus, fUSI recordings can compensate for differences in brain size, allowing for a detailed mapping of the ferret auditory cortex with a greater number of voxels than typically achieved in fMRI studies of the human auditory cortex. Last, to minimize potential biases, we applied the same criteria for voxel inclusion and noise-correction procedures across datasets. Thus, while minor differences in data quality and experimental protocols exist, they are unlikely to fully account for the species differences we observed.</p>
<p>Second, ferret and human paradigms differed by their control of attention. Ferrets were passively listening to the sounds while human participants had to perform a simple loudness-based task to ensure attention to the sounds. Even though specific auditory attention is not necessary for the gradient in invariance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Kell &amp; McDermott, 2019</xref>), the task ensured that subjects remained in a state of engagement or general attention. This state might in turn refine auditory representations via top-down processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Elhilali et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Saderi et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Schwartz &amp; David, 2018</xref>). Thus, we cannot exclude that both species possess a similar feedforward acoustic analysis (well modeled by simple spectrotemporal filters) as well as more context-driven networks in non-primary auditory cortex, which were more strongly engaged in humans than in ferrets due to experimental procedures. In addition, the presented sounds might have been more salient for humans than ferrets. Despite including ferret vocalizations and environmental sounds that are more ecologically relevant for ferrets, it is not clear whether ferrets would behaviorally categorize foregrounds and backgrounds as humans do. Examining how ferrets naturally orient or respond to foreground and background sounds under more ecologically valid conditions, potentially with free exploration or spontaneous listening paradigms, could help address this issue.</p>
<p>Third, human non-primary regions could host higher-order computations that cannot be predicted by simple acoustic features and are not present in ferrets. Human and non-human primates have a complex functional architecture in the auditory belt and parabelt regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Hackett, 2007</xref>), likely supporting elaborate computations. These computations might be related to conspecific calls and required for advanced vocal communication. In particular, the unique importance of speech for humans has shaped auditory circuits throughout the brain. Neural circuits in human non-primary auditory cortex encode higher-order acoustic features, such as phonemic patterns, which might help to segregate meaningful content from background noise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Norman-Haignere et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Mesgarani et al., 2014</xref>). Last, other processes might critically shape background-invariant representations in humans, such as dynamic adaptation to backgrounds that could be faster in humans than in ferrets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Khalighinejad et al., 2019</xref>).</p>
<p>The divergence in background invariance mechanisms between humans and ferrets may reflect differences in the depth and complexity of their auditory cortical hierarchies. Our previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Landemard et al., 2021</xref>) showed that large-scale representations of natural sounds are not clearly distinct between primary and non-primary auditory regions in the ferret cortex. However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Sabat et al. (2025)</xref> found a hierarchical organization of temporal integration in ferrets, reminiscent of humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Norman-Haignere et al., 2022</xref>). In the present study, we found a gradient of background invariance that was similarly structured as in humans, yet relying on different mechanisms. Altogether, this raises a fundamental question: does the ferret auditory cortex correspond to the different early auditory fields in the human core regions, with deeper hierarchical stages simply being absent? Or do these differences reflect evolutionary divergence, with partly shared computational principles and homologous hierarchy, but additional cortical modules in humans, enabling for instance more sophisticated background segregation or dedicated speech and music processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Norman-Haignere &amp; McDermott, 2018</xref>)? Addressing these questions will require a finer characterization of cross-species homologies, leveraging high-resolution functional imaging and electro-physiological recordings to uncover whether hierarchical transformations in auditory processing follow a conserved or species-specific trajectory.</p>

<title>Animal preparation</title>
<p>Experiments were performed in three female ferrets (B, L and R), across one or both hemispheres (left for all ferrets + right for R). Experiments were approved by the French Ministry of Agriculture (protocol authorization: 21022) and strictly comply with the European directives on the protection of animals used for scientific purposes (2010/63/EU). Animal preparation and fUS imaging were performed as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Bimbard et al. (2018)</xref>. Briefly, a metal headpost was surgically implanted on the skull under anesthesia. After recovery from surgery, a craniotomy was performed over auditory cortex and then sealed with an ultrasound-transparent Polymethylpentene (TPX) cover, embedded in an implant of dental cement. Animals could then recover for 1 week, with unrestricted access to food, water, and environmental enrichment.</p>
<p>fUS data were collected using an Iconeus One system (Iconeus, Paris, France) and a linear IcoPrime ultrasonic probe (15 MHz central frequency, 70% bandwidth, 0.110 mm pitch, 128 elements). Complex frames are acquired at 500 Hz. To remove tissue motion, a spatio-temporal clutter filter is applied using sets of 200 contiguous frames (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Demene et al., 2015</xref>). The Power Doppler signal is then obtained by taking the mean power over these 200 frames, thus getting an effective 2.5 Hz sampling rate. The Power Doppler signal is approximately proportional to cerebral blood volume (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Macé et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>In each recording day, we imaged activity in response to the entire sound set sequentially in two coronal slices. The probe was angled at ~30-35 degrees relative to the vertical axis in order for it to be roughly parallel to the surface of the brain. Through several recording sessions, we covered primary to tertiary regions of auditory cortex. Coronal slices were 14 mm wide, and spaced 0.4 mm apart. The resolution of each voxel was 0.1 <italic>×</italic> 0.1 <italic>×</italic> ~0.4 mm (the latter dimension, called elevation, is dependent on the depth of the voxel).</p>

<title>Sound stimuli</title>
<p>To choose foreground vs. background sounds, we used a previously established method based on sounds’ stationarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Kell &amp; McDermott, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">McWalter &amp; McDermott, 2019</xref>). We reproduce here a description of this algorithm from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">McWalter &amp; McDermott (2019)</xref>.</p>
<p>To quantify the stationarity of real-world sound recordings, we computed the standard deviation of the texture statistics measured across successive segments of a signal, for a variety of segment lengths (0.125, 0.25, 0.5, 1, and 2 s). For each segment length, we performed the following steps. First, we divided a signal into adjacent segments of the specified duration and measured the statistics in each segment. Second, we computed the standard deviation across the segments. Third, we averaged the standard deviation across statistics within each statistic class (envelope mean, envelope coefficient of variation, envelope skewness, envelope correlations, modulation power, and modulation correlations). Fourth, we normalized the average standard deviation for a class by its median value across sounds (to put the statistic classes on comparable scales, and to compensate for any differences between statistics in intrinsic variability). Fifth, we averaged the normalized values across statistics classes. Sixth, we averaged the resulting measure for the five segment lengths to yield a single measure of variability for each real-world sound recording. Finally, we took the negative logarithm of this quantity, yielding the stationarity measure.</p>
<p>We then defined arbitrary thresholds to define foregrounds and backgrounds, so that both groups were well separated in the stationarity axis (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). Sounds were taken from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Kell &amp; McDermott (2019)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Norman-Haignere et al.

<p>Foreground and background streams were composed of sequences of 6 different sound snippets of 9.6 s duration, repeated twice, so that a same snippet would occur at two distinct times of the stream (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). For each condition, 6 such streams were created by drawing randomly from a pool of 36 individual snippets. Foreground and background streams were presented in isolation and in mixtures. In mixtures, both streams were overlaid with a delay of 4.8 s so that a change, either of foreground or background, occurred every 4.8 s. Each foreground stream was presented with two different background streams, and vice versa. In this design, each foreground snippet was presented with 4 different backgrounds, and in two history contexts.</p>
<p>Recording sessions were composed of three “runs” in which two foreground streams and two background streams were presented in all possible combinations, each preceded by 20 s of silence to establish baseline activity. These runs were presented twice. The order of sounds within each run was fixed, but the relative order of runs was randomized for each recording session. A list of sounds used is available in table 1.</p>
<p>Sounds were presented at 65 dB SPL. In mixtures, foregrounds and backgrounds were presented with a similar gain (0 dB SNR). Each snippet was normalized by its root mean square prior to integration in the sequence.</p>

In the rest of the analyses, we use time-averaged responses (2.4 to 4.8 s after sound change).

<p>We computed the voxelwise test-retest correlation by correlating the vector of time-averaged responses to sounds across two repeats, for each category (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>).

<title>Cochlear and spectrotemporal modulation energy estimation</title>
<p>Spectrotemporal modulation energy was calculated by measuring the strength of modulations in filtered cochleagrams (which highlight modulations at a particular temporal rate and/ or spectral scale) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Chi et al., 2005</xref>). Specifically, modulation strength was computed as the standard deviation across time of each frequency channel of the filtered cochleagram, using the same 400 ms windows as for fUSI data. The bank of spectrotemporal filters used was the same as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Landemard et al. (2021)</xref> (scales: 0, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8 cyc/oct; rates: 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64 Hz). Modulation energy was then averaged in 10 frequency bins (centers: 27, 50, 91, 167, 307, 1032, 3470 Hz).</p>
<p>We then averaged modulation energy using the same temporal window as for fUSI sound-evoked data (2.4-4.8 s after sound change), after shifting it by −0.8 s to account for hemodynamic delays. We thus obtained a feature matrix (frequency * temporal modulation * spectral modulation) for each sound segment.</p>
<p>We fit a linear model using ridge regression to predict voxel responses from sound features. The feature matrix was z-scored as part of the regression. We used 6-fold cross-validation: we split the sound set in 6 folds (keeping blocks of temporally adjacent sounds in the same fold). One fold was left out and the others were used to fit the weights. The lambda hyperparameter was defined using an inner cross-validation loop. The fitted weights were used to predict responses to left-out sounds. We thus built a matrix of cross-validated predicted responses and applied the same analyses as were applied to the true data (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>). Prediction accuracy was defined as the Pearson correlation between measured and cross-validated predicted responses (Figure S5).</p>
<p>To examine the fitted weights, we averaged the weights obtained in all cross-validation folds and multiplied them by the standard deviation of the feature matrix. To extract voxels’ preferred value over one feature axis (e.g. frequency), we first averaged the weight matrix along the other feature axes (e.g. spectral and temporal modulation) and used the value of the feature for which the maximum was reached. For plotting the tuning maps and the analysis of voxels tuned to low or high rates, we only considered voxels with average prediction accuracy in left-out folds higher than 0.3.</p>

<p>To directly compare our results with those obtained in humans, we used the dataset from Kell &amp; McDer-mott (2019).

Foregrounds and backgrounds were determined based on a criterion of stationarity, similar to our study. For each subject, backgrounds and foregrounds were matched at random (so that the mixtures were different for each subject). Each sound was presented 4 times. The SNR (ratio of power of the foreground versus the background noise) was −6 dB (vs 0 dB in our case). To encourage attention to each stimulus, participants performed a sound intensity discrimination task on the stimuli. We used a similar criterion for voxel inclusion and conducted the same analyses as for ferrets. Ridge regression was performed using 10-fold cross-validation.

<title>Statistical testing</title>
<p>To test the difference between background and foreground invariance for each ROI, we ran a permutation test. We built the null distribution by randomly permuting foreground and background labels for each sound and computing invariance for each voxel, 1000 times. We then compared the median difference between background and foreground invariance across voxels, to the values obtained in this null distribution and used the proportion of null values higher than the observed difference to obtain our p-value.</p>
<p>To compute statistical significance between ROIs, we also performed a permutation test. We did the following procedure for each pair of ROI (MEG vs. dPEG, dPEG vs. VP). We built a null distribution by shu?ing ROI labels for voxels belonging to the pair of ROIs within each animal, 2000 times. We then compared the observed average across animals of the difference of median correlations between ROIs across animals to this null distribution and used the proportion of null values more extreme than the observed difference to obtain our p-value. We also computed a p-value for each ferret separately (see table 2). We also ran this test by first focusing on voxels tuned to high or low rates within each ROI.</p>
<p>To test for differences in invariance between voxels tuned to low (&lt; 8Hz) or high (&gt; 8Hz) temporal modulation rates within each ROI, we used a similar permutation test in which we compared the difference of invariance between voxels tuned to low vs. high rates to a null distribution in which we shu?ed the tuning values across voxels within each animal and ROI.</p>
<p>To compare results between ferrets and humans, we performed Wilcoxon rank-sum tests between ferrets and human subjects for different metrics: median prediction accuracy across voxels, median noise-corrected correlation between measured and predicted invariance. For the latter, we also tested the difference to zero using a sign-rank test.</p>

<p>This paper presents <bold>valuable</bold> findings on the processing of sound mixtures in the auditory cortex of ferrets, a species widely used for studies of auditory processing. Using the convenient and relatively high-resolution method of functional ultrasound imaging, the authors provide <bold>solid</bold> evidence that background noise invariance emerges across the auditory cortical processing hierarchy. However, differences between this and other methods limit the comparisons that can be made across different species, and additional controls are needed to fully substantiate the paper's claims. This work will nonetheless be of interest to researchers studying the auditory cortex and the neural mechanisms underlying auditory scene analysis and hearing in noise.</p>

<p>This is a very interesting paper addressing the hierarchical nature of the mammalian auditory system. The authors use an unconventional technique to assess brain responses -- functional ultrasound imaging (fUSI). This measures blood volume in the cortex at a relatively high spatial resolution. They present dynamic and stationary sounds in isolation and together, and show that the effect of the stationary sounds (relative to the dynamic sounds) on blood volume measurements decreases as one ascends the auditory hierarchy. Since the dynamic/stationary nature of sounds is related to their perception as foreground/background sounds (see below for more details), this suggests that neurons in higher levels of the cortex may be increasingly invariant to background sounds.</p>
<p>The study is interesting, well conducted, and well written. I am broadly convinced by the results. However, I do have some concerns about the validity of the results, given the unconventional technique. fUSI is convenient because it is much less invasive than electrophysiology, and can image a large region of the cortex in one go. However, the relationship between blood volume and neuronal activity is unclear, and blood volume measurements are heavily temporally averaged relative to the underlying neuronal responses. I am particularly concerned about the implications of this for a study on dynamic/stationary stimuli in auditory cortical hierarchy, because the time scale of the dynamic sounds is such that much of the dynamic structure may be affected by this temporal averaging. Also, there is a well-known decrease in temporal following rate that is exhibited by neurons at higher levels of the auditory system. This means that results in different areas will be differently affected by the temporal averaging. I would like to see additional control models to investigate the impact of this.</p>
<p>I also think that the authors should address several caveats: the fact that their measurements heavily spatially average neuronal responses, and therefore may not accurately reflect the underlying neuronal coding; that the perceptual background/foreground distinction is not identical to the dynamic/stationary distinction used here; and that ferret background/foreground perception may be very different from that in humans.</p>
<p>Major points</p>
<p>(1) Changes in blood volume due to brain activity are indirectly related to neuronal responses. The exact relationship is not clear, however, we do know two things for certain: (a) each measurable unit of blood volume change depends on the response of hundreds or thousands of neurons, and (b) the time course of the volume changes are are slow compared to the potential time course of the underlying neuronal responses. Both of these mean that important variability in neuronal responses will be averaged out when measuring blood changes. For example, if two neighbouring neurons have opposite responses to a given stimulus, this will produce opposite changes in blood volume, which will cancel each other out in the blood volume measurement due to (a). This is important in the present study because blood volume changes are implicitly being used as a measure of coding in the underlying neuronal population. The authors need to acknowledge that this is a coarse measure of neuronal responses and that important aspects of neuronal responses may be missing from the blood volume measure.</p>
<p>(2) More importantly for the present study, however, the effect of (b) is that any rapid changes in the response of a single neuron will be cancelled out by temporal averaging. Imagine a neuron whose response is transient, consisting of rapid excitation followed by rapid inhibition. Temporal averaging of these two responses will tend to cancel out both of them. As a result, blood volume measurements will tend to smooth out any fast, dynamic responses in the underlying neuronal population. In the present study, this temporal averaging is likely to be particularly important because the authors are comparing responses to dynamic (nonstationary) stimuli with responses to more constant stimuli. To a first approximation, neuronal responses to dynamic stimuli are themselves dynamic, and responses to constant stimuli are themselves constant. Therefore, the averaging will mean that the responses to dynamic stimuli are suppressed relative to the real responses in the underlying neurons, whereas the responses to constant stimuli are more veridical. On top of this, temporal following rates tend to decrease as one ascends the auditory hierarchy, meaning that the comparison between dynamic and stationary responses will be differently affected in different brain areas. As a result, the dynamic/stationary balance is expected to change as you ascend the hierarchy, and I would expect this to directly affect the results observed in this study.</p>
<p>It is not trivial to extrapolate from what we know about temporal following in the cortex to know exactly what the expected effect would be on the authors' results. As a first-pass control, I would strongly suggest incorporating into the authors' filterbank model a range of realistic temporal following rates (decreasing at higher levels), and spatially and temporally average these responses to get modelled cerebral blood flow measurements. I would want to know whether this model showed similar effects as in Figure 2. From my guess about what this model would show, I think it would not predict the effects shown by the authors in Figure 2. Nevertheless, this is an important issue to address and to provide control for.</p>
<p>(3) I do not agree with the equivalence that the authors draw between the statistical stationarity of sounds and their classification as foreground or background sounds. It is true that, in a common foreground/background situation - speech against a background of white noise - the foreground is non-stationary and the background is stationary. However, it is easy to come up with examples where this relationship is reversed. For example, a continuous pure tone is perfectly stationary, but will be perceived as a foreground sound if played loudly. Background music may be very non-stationary but still easily ignored as a background sound when listening to overlaid speech. Ultimately, the foreground/background distinction is a perceptual one that is not exclusively determined by physical characteristics of the sounds, and certainly not by a simple measure of stationarity. I understand that the use of foreground/background in the present study increases the likely reach of the paper, but I don't think it is appropriate to use this subjective/imprecise terminology in the results section of the paper.</p>
<p>(4) Related to the above, I think further caveats need to be acknowledged in the study. We do not know what sounds are perceived as foreground or background sounds by ferrets, or indeed whether they make this distinction reliably to the degree that humans do. Furthermore, the individual sounds used here have not been tested for their foreground/background-ness. Thus, the analysis relies on two logical jumps - first, that the stationarity of these sounds predicts their foreground/background perception in humans, and second, that this perceptual distinction is similar in ferrets and humans. I don't think it is known to what degree these jumps are justified. These issues do not directly affect the results, but I think it is essential to address these issues in the Discussion, because they are potentially major caveats to our understanding of the work.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Noise invariance is an essential computation in sensory systems for stable perception across a wide range of contexts. In this paper, Landemard et al. perform functional ultrasound imaging across primary, secondary, and tertiary auditory cortex in ferrets to uncover the mesoscale organization of background invariance in auditory cortex. Consistent with previous work, they find that background invariance increases throughout the cortical hierarchy. Importantly, they find that background invariance is largely explained by progressive changes in spectrotemporal tuning across cortical stations, which are biased towards foreground sound features. To test if these results are broadly relevant, they then re-analyze human fMRI data and find that spectro-temporal tuning fails to explain background invariance in human auditory cortex.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) Novelty of approach: Though the authors have published on this technique previously, functional ultrasound imaging offers unprecedented temporal and spatial resolution in a species where large-scale calcium imaging is not possible and electrophysiological mapping would take weeks or months. Combining mesoscale imaging with a clever stimulus paradigm, they address a fundamental question in sensory coding.</p>
<p>(2) Quantification and execution: The results are generally clear and well supported by statistical quantification.</p>
<p>(3) Elegance of modeling: The spectrotemporal model presented here is explained clearly and, most importantly, provides a compelling framework for understanding differences in background invariance across cortical areas.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) Interpretation of the cerebral blood volume signal: While the results are compelling, more caution should be exercised by the authors in framing their results, given that they are measuring an indirect measure of neural activity, this is the difference between stating &quot;CBV in area MEG was less background invariant than in higher areas&quot; vs. saying &quot;MEG was less background invariant than other areas&quot;. Beyond framing, the basic properties of the CBV signal should be better explored:</p>
<p>a) Cortical vasculature is highly structured (e.g. Kirst et al.( 2020) Cell). One potential explanation for the results is simply differences in vasculature and blood flow between primary and secondary areas of auditory cortex, even if fUS is sensitive to changes in blood flow, changes in capillary beds, etc (Mace et al., 2011) Nat. Methods.. This concern could be addressed by either analyzing spontaneous fluctuations in the CBV signal during silent periods or computing a signal-to-noise ratio of voxels across areas across all sound types. This is especially important given the complex 3D geometry of gyri and sulci in the ferret brain.</p>
<p>b) Figure 1 leaves the reader uncertain what exactly is being encoded by the CBV signal, as temporal responses to different stimuli look very similar in the examples shown. One possibility is that the CBV is an acoustic change signal. In that case, sounds that are farther apart in acoustic space from previous sounds would elicit larger responses, which is straightforward to test. Another possibility is that the fUS signal reflects time-varying features in the acoustic signal (e.g. the low-frequency envelope). This could be addressed by cross-correlating the stimulus envelope with fUS waveform. The third possibility, which the authors argue, is that the magnitude of the fUS signal encodes the stimulus ID. A better understanding of the justification for only looking at the fUS magnitude in a short time window (2-4.8 s re: stimulus onset) would increase my confidence in the results.</p>
<p>(2) Interpretation of the human data: The authors acknowledge in the discussion that there are several differences between fMRI and fUS. The results would be more compelling if they performed a control analysis where they downsampled the Ferret fUS data spatially and temporally to match the resolution of fMRI and demonstrated that their ferret results hold with lower spatiotemporal resolution.</p>

<p>This paper investigates invariance to natural background noise in the auditory cortex of ferrets and humans. The authors first replicate, in ferrets, a finding from human neuroimaging showing that invariance to background noise increases along the cortical hierarchy (i.e., from primary to non-primary auditory cortex). Next, the authors ask whether this pattern of invariance could be explained by differences in tuning to low-level acoustic features across primary and non-primary regions. The authors conclude that this tuning can explain the spatial organization of background invariance in ferrets, but not in humans. The conclusions of the paper are generally well supported by the data, but additional control analyses are needed to fully substantiate the paper's claims. Finally, additional discussion and potentially analysis, are needed to reconcile these findings with similar work in the literature (particularly that of Hamersky et al. 2025 J. Neurosci.).</p>
<p>The paper is very straightforwardly written, with a generally clear presentation including well-designed and visually appealing figures. Not only does this paper provide an important replication in a non-human animal model commonly used in auditory neuroscience, but it also extends the original findings in three ways. First, the authors reveal a more fine-grained gradient of background invariance by showing that background invariance increases across primary, secondary, and tertiary cortical regions. Second, the authors address a potential mechanism that might underlie this pattern of invariance by considering whether differences in tuning to frequency and spectrotemporal modulations across regions could account for the observed pattern of invariance. The spectrotemporal modulation encoding model used here is a well-established approach in auditory neuroscience and seems appropriate for exploring potential mechanisms underlying invariance in auditory cortex, particularly in ferrets. However, as discussed below, the analyses based on this simple encoding model are only informative to the extent that the model accurately captures neural responses. Thus, its limitations in modeling non-primary human auditory cortex should be considered when interpreting cross-species comparisons. Third, the authors provide a more complete picture of invariance by additionally analyzing foreground invariance, a complementary measure not explored in the original study. While this analysis feels like a natural extension and its inclusion is appreciated, the interpretation of these foreground invariance findings remains somewhat unclear, as the authors offer limited discussion of their significance or relation to existing literature.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, interpretation of the invariance analyses using predictions from the spectrotemporal modulation encoding model hinges on the model's ability to accurately predict neural responses. Although Figure S5 suggests the encoding model was generally able to predict voxel responses accurately, the authors note in the introduction that, in human auditory cortex, this kind of tuning can explain responses in primary areas but not in non-primary areas (Norman-Haignere &amp; McDermott, PLOS Biol. 2018). Indeed, the prediction accuracy histograms in Figure S5C suggest a slight difference in the model's ability to predict responses in primary versus non-primary voxels. Additional analyses should be done to a) determine whether the prediction accuracies are meaningfully different across regions and b) examine whether controlling for prediction accuracy across regions (i.e., sub-selecting voxels across regions with matched prediction accuracy) affects the outcomes of the invariance analyses.</p>
<p>A related concern is the procedure used to train the encoding model. From the methods, it appears that the model may have been fit using responses to both isolated and mixture sounds. If so, this raises questions about the interpretability of the invariance analyses. In particular, fitting the model to all stimuli, including mixtures, may inflate the apparent ability of the model to &quot;explain&quot; invariance, since it is effectively trained on the phenomenon it is later evaluated on. Put another way, if a voxel exhibits invariance, and the model is trained to predict the voxel's responses to all types of stimuli (both isolated sounds and mixtures), then the model must also show invariance to the extent it can accurately predict voxel responses, making the result somewhat circular. A more informative approach would be to train the encoding model only on responses to isolated sounds (or even better, a completely independent set of sounds), as this would help clarify whether any observed invariance is emergent from the model (i.e., truly a result of low-level tuning to spectrotemporal features) or simply reflects what it was trained to reproduce.</p>
<p>Finally, the interpretation of the foreground invariance results remains somewhat unclear. In ferrets (Figure 2I), the authors report relatively little foreground invariance, whereas in humans (Figure 5G), most participants appear to show relatively high levels of foreground invariance in primary auditory cortex (around 0.6 or greater). However, the paper does not explicitly address these apparent cross-species differences. Moreover, the findings in ferrets seem at odds with other recent work in ferrets (Hamersky et al. 2025 J. Neurosci.), which shows that background sounds tend to dominate responses to mixtures, suggesting a prevalence of foreground invariance at the neuronal level. Although this comparison comes with the caveat that the methods differ substantially from those used in the current study, given the contrast with the findings of this paper, further discussion would nonetheless be valuable to help contextualize the current findings and clarify how they relate to prior work.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #1:</bold></p>
<p>(1) Changes in blood volume due to brain activity are indirectly related to neuronal responses. The exact relationship is not clear, however, we do know two things for certain: (a) each measurable unit of blood volume change depends on the response of hundreds or thousands of neurons, and (b) the time course of the volume changes are slow compared to the potential time course of the underlying neuronal responses. Both of these mean that important variability in neuronal responses will be averaged out when measuring blood changes. For example, if two neighbouring neurons have opposite responses to a given stimulus, this will produce opposite changes in blood volume, which will cancel each other out in the blood volume measurement due to (a). This is important in the present study because blood volume changes are implicitly being used as a measure of coding in the underlying neuronal population. The authors need to acknowledge that this is a coarse measure of neuronal responses and that important aspects of neuronal responses may be missing from the blood volume measure.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The reviewer is correct: we do not measure neuronal firing, but use blood volume as a proxy for bulk local neuronal activity, which does not capture the richness of single neuron responses. We will highlight this point in the manuscript. This is why the paper focuses on large-scale spatial representations as well as cross-species comparison. For this latter purpose, fMRI responses are on par with our fUSI data, with both neuroimaging techniques showing the same weakness.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) More importantly for the present study, however, the effect of (b) is that any rapid changes in the response of a single neuron will be cancelled out by temporal averaging. Imagine a neuron whose response is transient, consisting of rapid excitation followed by rapid inhibition. Temporal averaging of these two responses will tend to cancel out both of them. As a result, blood volume measurements will tend to smooth out any fast, dynamic responses in the underlying neuronal population. In the present study, this temporal averaging is likely to be particularly important because the authors are comparing responses to dynamic (nonstationary) stimuli with responses to more constant stimuli. To a first approximation, neuronal responses to dynamic stimuli are themselves dynamic, and responses to constant stimuli are themselves constant. Therefore, the averaging will mean that the responses to dynamic stimuli are suppressed relative to the real responses in the underlying neurons, whereas the responses to constant stimuli are more veridical. On top of this, temporal following rates tend to decrease as one ascends the auditory hierarchy, meaning that the comparison between dynamic and stationary responses will be differently affected in different brain areas. As a result, the dynamic/stationary balance is expected to change as you ascend the hierarchy, and I would expect this to directly affect the results observed in this study.</p>
<p>It is not trivial to extrapolate from what we know about temporal following in the cortex to know exactly what the expected effect would be on the authors' results. As a first-pass control, I would strongly suggest incorporating into the authors' filterbank model a range of realistic temporal following rates (decreasing at higher levels), and spatially and temporally average these responses to get modelled cerebral blood flow measurements. I would want to know whether this model showed similar effects as in Figure 2. From my guess about what this model would show, I think it would not predict the effects shown by the authors in Figure 2. Nevertheless, this is an important issue to address and to provide control for.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We understand the reviewer’s concern about potential differences in response dynamics in stationary vs non-stationary sounds. In particular, it seems that the reviewer is concerned that responses to foregrounds may be suppressed in non-primary fields because foregrounds are not stationary, and non-primary regions could struggle to track and respond to these sounds. Nevertheless, we  observed the contrary, with non-primary regions over-representing non-stationary (dynamic) sounds, over stationary ones. For this reason, we are inclined to think that this explanation cannot falsify our findings.</p>
<p>Furthermore, background sounds are not completely constant: they are still dynamic sounds, but their temporal modulation rates are usually faster (see Figure 3B). Similarly, neural responses to these two types of sounds are dynamic (see for example Hamersky et al., 2025, Figure 1).  Thus, we are not sure that blood volume would transform the responses to these types of sounds non-linearly.</p>
<p>We understand the comment that temporal following rates might differ across regions in the auditory hierarchy and agree. In fact, we show that tuning to temporal rates differ across regions and partly explains the differences in background invariance we observe. We think the reviewer’s suggestion is already implemented by our spectrotemporal model, which incorporates the full range of realistic temporal following rates (up to 128 Hz). The temporal averaging is done as we take the output of the model (which varies continuously through time) and average it in the same window as we used for our fUSI data. When we fit this model to the ferret data, we find that voxels in non-primary regions, especially VP (tertiary auditory cortex), tend to be more tuned to low temporal rates (Figure 2F, G), and that background invariance is stronger in voxels tuned to low rates. This is, however, not true in humans, suggesting that background invariance in humans rely on different computational mechanisms.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) I do not agree with the equivalence that the authors draw between the statistical stationarity of sounds and their classification as foreground or background sounds. It is true that, in a common foreground/background situation - speech against a background of white noise - the foreground is non-stationary and the background is stationary. However, it is easy to come up with examples where this relationship is reversed. For example, a continuous pure tone is perfectly stationary, but will be perceived as a foreground sound if played loudly. Background music may be very non-stationary but still easily ignored as a background sound when listening to overlaid speech. Ultimately, the foreground/background distinction is a perceptual one that is not exclusively determined by physical characteristics of the sounds, and certainly not by a simple measure of stationarity. I understand that the use of foreground/background in the present study increases the likely reach of the paper, but I don't think it is appropriate to use this subjective/imprecise terminology in the results section of the paper.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the reviewer’s comment that the classification of our sounds into foregrounds and backgrounds is not verified by any perceptual experiments. We use those terms to be consistent with the literature, including the paper we derived this definition from (Kell et al., 2019). These terms are widely used in studies where no perceptual or behavioral experiments are included, and even when animals are anesthetized. However, we will emphasize the limits of this definition when introducing it, as well as in the discussion.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) Related to the above, I think further caveats need to be acknowledged in the study. We do not know what sounds are perceived as foreground or background sounds by ferrets, or indeed whether they make this distinction reliably to the degree that humans do. Furthermore, the individual sounds used here have not been tested for their foreground/background-ness. Thus, the analysis relies on two logical jumps - first, that the stationarity of these sounds predicts their foreground/background perception in humans, and second, that this perceptual distinction is similar in ferrets and humans. I don't think it is known to what degree these jumps are justified. These issues do not directly affect the results, but I think it is essential to address these issues in the Discussion, because they are potentially major caveats to our understanding of the work.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the reviewer that the foreground-background distinction might be different in ferrets. In anticipation of that issue, we had enriched the sound set with more ecologically relevant sounds, such as ferret and other animal vocalizations. Nevertheless, the point remains valid and is already raised in the discussion. We will emphasize this limitation in addition to the limitation of our definition of foregrounds and backgrounds.</p>

<p>(1) Interpretation of the cerebral blood volume signal: While the results are compelling, more caution should be exercised by the authors in framing their results, given that they are measuring an indirect measure of neural activity, this is the difference between stating &quot;CBV in area MEG was less background invariant than in higher areas&quot; vs. saying &quot;MEG was less background invariant than other areas&quot;. Beyond framing, the basic properties of the CBV signal should be better explored:</p>
<p>a) Cortical vasculature is highly structured (e.g. Kirst et al.( 2020) Cell). One potential explanation for the results is simply differences in vasculature and blood flow between primary and secondary areas of auditory cortex, even if fUS is sensitive to changes in blood flow, changes in capillary beds, etc (Mace et al., 2011) Nat. Methods.. This concern could be addressed by either analyzing spontaneous fluctuations in the CBV signal during silent periods or computing a signal-to-noise ratio of voxels across areas across all sound types. This is especially important given the complex 3D geometry of gyri and sulci in the ferret brain.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the reviewers that there could be differences in vasculature across subregions of the auditory cortex. We will run analyses providing comparisons of basic signal properties across our different regions of interest. We note that this point would also be valid for the human fMRI data, for which we cannot run these controls. Nevertheless, this should not affect our analyses and results, which should be independent of local vascular density. First, we normalize the signal in each voxel before any analysis, so that the absolute strength of the signal, or blood volume in a given voxel, does not matter. Second, we do see sound-evoked responses in all regions (Figure S2) and only focus on reliable voxels in each region. Third, our analysis mostly relies on voxel-based correlation across sounds, which is independent of the mean and variance of the voxel responses. Thus, we believe that differences in vascular architecture across regions are unlikely to affect our results.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>b) Figure 1 leaves the reader uncertain what exactly is being encoded by the CBV signal, as temporal responses to different stimuli look very similar in the examples shown. One possibility is that the CBV is an acoustic change signal. In that case, sounds that are farther apart in acoustic space from previous sounds would elicit larger responses, which is straightforward to test. Another possibility is that the fUS signal reflects time-varying features in the acoustic signal (e.g. the low-frequency envelope). This could be addressed by cross-correlating the stimulus envelope with fUS waveform. The third possibility, which the authors argue, is that the magnitude of the fUS signal encodes the stimulus ID. A better understanding of the justification for only looking at the fUS magnitude in a short time window (2-4.8 s re: stimulus onset) would increase my confidence in the results.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for raising that point as it highlights that the layout of Figure 1 is misleading. While Figure 1B shows an example snippet of our sound streams, Figure 1D shows the average timecourse of CBV time-locked to a change in sound (foreground or background, isolated or in a mixture). This is the average across all voxels and sounds, and the point is just to illustrate the dynamics for the three broad categories. In Figure 1E however, we show the cross-validated cross-correlation of CBV  across sounds (and different time lags). To obtain this, we compute for each voxel the response to each sound at each time lag, thus obtaining two vector of size number of sounds per lag, one per repeat. Then, we correlate all these vectors across the two repeats, obtaining one cross-correlation matrix per neuron. We finally average these matrices across all neurons. The fact that you see red squares demonstrates that the signal encodes sound identity, since CBV is more similar across two repeats of the same sound (for e.g., in the foreground only matrix, 0-5 s vs 0-5 s), than two different sounds (0-5 s vs. 7-12 s). We will modify the figure layout as well as the legend to improve clarity.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) Interpretation of the human data: The authors acknowledge in the discussion that there are several differences between fMRI and fUS. The results would be more compelling if they performed a control analysis where they downsampled the Ferret fUS data spatially and temporally to match the resolution of fMRI and demonstrated that their ferret results hold with lower spatiotemporal resolution.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the reviewer that the use of different techniques might come in the way of cross-species comparison. We will add additional discussion on this point. We already control for the temporal aspect by using the average of stimulus-evoked activity across time (note that due to scanner noise, sounds are presented cut into small pieces in the fMRI experiments). Regarding the spatial aspect, there are several things to consider. First, both species have brains of very different sizes, a factor that is conveniently compensated for by the higher spatial resolution of fUSI compared to fMRI (0.1 vs 2 mm). Downsampling to fMRI resolution would lead to having one voxel per region per slice, which is not feasible. We also summarize results with one value per region, which is a form of downsampling that is fairer across species. Furthermore, we believe that we already established in a previous study (Landemard et al, 2021 eLife) that fUSI and fMRI data are comparable signals. We indeed could predict human fMRI responses to most sounds from ferret fUSI responses to the same identical sounds.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>The reviewer is correct: the spectrotemporal model tends to perform less well in human non-primary cortex. We believe this does not contradict our results but goes in the same direction: while there is a gradient in invariance in both ferrets and humans, this gradient is predicted by the spectrotemporal model in ferrets, but not in humans (possibly indeed because predictions are less good in human non-primary auditory cortex). Regardless of the mechanism, this result points to a difference across species. We will clarify these points by quantifying potential differences in prediction accuracy in both species and comment on those in the manuscript.</p>

<p>We thank the reviewer for this point. We will indeed add further discussion of the  difference between ferrets and humans in foreground invariance in primary auditory cortex. In addition, while we found a trend for higher background invariance than foreground invariance in ferret primary auditory cortex, this difference was not significant and many voxels exhibit similar levels of background and foreground invariance (for example in Figure 2D, G). Thus, we do not think our results are inconsistent with Hamersky et al., 2025, though we agree the bias towards background sounds is not as strong in our data. This might indeed reflect differences in methodology, both in the signal that is measured (blood volume vs spikes), and the sound presentation paradigm. We will add this point to our discussion.</p>
