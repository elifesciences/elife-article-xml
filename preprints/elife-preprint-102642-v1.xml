<title>Abstract</title><p>Despite growing understanding of the various roles mitochondria play in neurons, how they contribute to higher brain functions such as learning and memory remains underexplored. Here, using the nematode <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans,</italic> we found that the mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU) pore forming unit MCU-1 is required for aversive learning to specific odors sensed by a single sensory neuron, AWC<sup>ON</sup>. MCU-1 expression was required in the sensory neuron at the time of odor conditioning for proper behavioral response to 60 min of prolonged odor exposure. Through genetic and pharmacological manipulation, we show evidence that MCU is activated in response to prolonged odor conditioning, causing mtROS production, leading to NLP-1 secretion. Finally, we show that the timing of MCU activation and neuropeptide release correspond with the OFF-neuron properties of the AWC neuron, suggesting that mitochondrial calcium entry and neuropeptide secretion coincide with AWC activation upon odor removal. Overall, our results demonstrate that, by regulating mitochondrial calcium influx, mitochondria can modulate the synaptic response to incoming stimuli in the sensory neuron, resulting in learning and modified behavior.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Learning and memory allow past experience of an organism to adjust and shape their behavior, thereby increasing its fitness and chance of survival. This behavioral plasticity is modulated by multiple factors such as the length and frequency of the experience, or concurrent external and internal sensory inputs. Such set of factors ensures that the learning and strength of the memory is commensurate to the type of experience and its context.</p>
<p>The cellular and molecular substrate for learning and memory is the change in synaptic activity strength. Among the numerous factors involved in modulating synaptic activity, mitochondria are reported to play a role by supplying ATP through energy metabolism(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Ashrafi <italic>et al</italic>, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Hebert-Chatelain <italic>et al</italic>, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Rangaraju <italic>et al</italic>, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Verstreken <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>), buffering calcium(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Alnaes &amp; Rahamimoff, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">David <italic>et al</italic>, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Lee <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Tang &amp; Zucker, 1997</xref>), and producing localized ROS(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Jia &amp; Sieburth, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Zhao <italic>et al</italic>, 2018</xref>). Consistent with this, a few studies have shown instances where mitochondria are involved in learning and memory(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Duan <italic>et al</italic>, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Hebert-Chatelain <italic>et al</italic>., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Oettinghaus <italic>et al</italic>, 2016</xref>), and mitochondrial dysfunction in the brain has been linked to synaptic dysfunction and decline in cognitive abilities(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Todorova &amp; Blokland, 2017</xref>). Further studies of mitochondria’s role in neuronal function are needed to understand the various ways in which metabolic activities and their dysfunction are interconnected with higher brain functions such as learning and memory.</p>
<p>The mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU) complex is the main route of calcium entry into mitochondria. The complex consists of MCU channel protein and several regulatory subunit proteins that play modulatory roles. In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, the complex consists of the channel protein MCU-1, along with two regulatory subunit proteins MICU-1 and EMRE-1. With the molecular identity revealed a little more than a decade ago(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Baughman <italic>et al</italic>, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">De Stefani <italic>et al</italic>, 2011</xref>), studies are beginning to uncover its various roles in different tissues during normal and pathological conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Burkewitz <italic>et al</italic>, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Higashitani <italic>et al</italic>, 2023</xref>). Even so, the mechanisms by which the channel is modulated in various tissues under physiological conditions remain poorly understood, and its functions and regulation in neurons are still emerging areas of study.</p>
<p>The nematode <italic>C. elegans</italic> displays complex behavior that can be modified through past experience. Its simple nervous system consisting of 302 neurons, its genetic tractability, and the array of tools available, offer the chance to investigate the detailed molecular underpinnings of learning and memory. <italic>C. elegans</italic> can learn to increase or decrease its attraction to odors based on past experience, and can control the degree of these modifications depending on the context and length of the experience(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Colbert &amp; Bargmann, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Kauffman <italic>et al</italic>, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Lee <italic>et al</italic>, 2010</xref>). For attractive odors such as butanone and benzaldehyde that are mainly detected by the chemosensory neuron AWC, prior experience to the odor in the absence of food makes them less attractive to the worms. How much less, is dependent on the length of the experience, and a gradual decline in attraction can be seen from 0 to 2 hours of prior exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Lee <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>). Interestingly, this progressive decline is mediated by distinct molecular steps and can be genetically separated. For example, <italic>cng-3</italic> in AWC is required for the mild decrease in attraction after 30 min of odor conditioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">O’Halloran <italic>et al</italic>, 2017</xref>). However, aversive learning to 60 min conditioning is unaffected in <italic>cng-3</italic> mutants, demonstrating the distinct molecular steps involved to produce the seemingly smooth continual decline in attraction. Similarly, nuclear translocation of the cGMP-dependent protein kinase EGL-4 in AWC is required for aversive learning to 60 min or longer conditioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Lee <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>). Thus, the aversive odor learning paradigm in <italic>C. elegans</italic> offers a compelling system to study the molecular mechanisms of behavioral plasticity.</p>
<p>In this study, we use <italic>C. elegans</italic> to show that MCU facilitates odor learning, and thus change in odor behavior, by controlling neuropeptide release from the primary sensory neuron. We found that <italic>mcu-1</italic> mutants are defective for aversive learning to AWC<sup>ON</sup>-sensed odors. MCU-1 was required in the AWC neuron, at the time of learning. The learning defect was specific to learning after 60-min conditioning, which requires the NLP-1 neuropeptide. By genetic and pharmacological manipulation, we show that MCU in the AWC responds to 60 min odor exposure to produce mitochondrial ROS(mtROS), which triggers NLP-1 secretion from the same neuron. Moreover, ectopic activation of MCU or mtROS production during odor exposure was sufficient to accelerate learning. Lastly, blocking MCU-1 at different time points during the 60 min conditioning revealed that MCU-1 was needed towards the end of the prolonged conditioning, which suggests mitochondrial calcium influx, and thus neuropeptide release, is coupled to the AWC calcium transient that occurs upon odor removal. Taken together, our study shows that mitochondria calcium in neurons contribute to learning by modulating the synaptic response to sensory stimuli.</p>

<title><italic>mcu-1</italic> mutants display AWC<sup>ON</sup>-specific aversive learning defect</title>
<p>To study the role of MCU in neurons, we tested a null mutant strain of <italic>mcu-1</italic> for behavioral defects, including odor behaviors. <italic>C. elegans</italic> detects attractive volatile odors mainly through two pairs of sensory neurons, AWC and AWA. The AWC neuron pair is asymmetric, and expresses different sets of receptors(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Wes &amp; Bargmann, 2001</xref>). With this in mind, we selected odorants that represented the function of each sensory neurons: diacetyl, 2-butanone, 2,3-pentanedione, and benzaldehyde, which are mainly sensed by AWA, AWC<sup>ON</sup>, AWC<sup>OFF</sup>, both AWCs, respectively (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>). Mutant worms showed normal chemotaxis for all odorants tested, indicating that worms can sense and move toward attractive odors in the absence of MCU-1 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B-C</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>We next tested <italic>mcu-1</italic> mutants for odor learning behaviors. In the aversive odor learning paradigm, previous exposure to odors without food causes worms to ignore or avoid what used to be an attractive odor (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>). After 60 min of pre-exposure, <italic>mcu-1</italic> mutants failed to display aversive learning to benzaldehyde and butanone, whereas learning for other odors remained normal (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1E</xref>). Since butanone is sensed by AWC<sup>ON</sup>, and benzaldehyde is sensed by both AWC neurons, this suggested that learning was specifically defective for AWC<sup>ON</sup>. Consistent with this, pentanedione, which is sensed by the AWC<sub>OFF</sub> neuron, showed normal aversive learning. Thus, <italic>mcu-1</italic> mutants fail to learn odors sensed by the AWC<sup>ON</sup> neuron.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2b">
<title>MCU-1 is required in the primary sensory neuron for aversive odor learning</title>
<p>We next sought to find where MCU-1 was needed for odor learning. We hypothesized that MCU-1 is likely needed in the neurons. To test this, we generated a transgenic strain that expressed MCU-1 under a neuron-specific promoter (<italic>rab-3p</italic>). As expected, neuronal <italic>mcu-1</italic> rescue strain showed normal aversive learning to both butanone and benzaldehyde (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1F,G</xref>). To further narrow down the neuron responsible, we next made a cell-specific <italic>mcu-1</italic> transgenic rescue strain. We hypothesized that MCU-1 is likely needed in the neuronal circuit that includes the primary sensory neuron AWC<sup>ON</sup> and a few immediately downstream interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Chen <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">White <italic>et al</italic>, 1986</xref>). When we expressed MCU-1 under the AWC-specific promoter (<italic>ceh-36p</italic>), we found that it was also sufficient to fully restore aversive learning (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1F,G</xref>). Thus, MCU-1 is needed in the sensory neuron AWC to mediate odor learning.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2c">
<title>MCU-1 is required post-developmentally</title>
<p>We next wondered when MCU-1 needed for odor learning. <italic>C. elegans</italic> goes through 4 larval stages until they reach adulthood. For most neurons, cell fates are determined during the embryonic stage and neurons are fully functional by the time of hatching . However, strength of neuronal response may change as the worm grows and matures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Fujiwara <italic>et al</italic>, 2016</xref>). To determine at which stsage MCU-1 is needed for odor learning, we generated a transgenic strain that expressed MCU-1 under a heat-inducible promoter. Inducing MCU-1 expression at different larval stages revealed that aversive learning was restored only when MCU-1 was induced at the adult stage, which was only a few hours before they were used for the aversive learning assay (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1H</xref>). This showed that MCU-1 is required post-developmentally, and close to the time of learning. We also noted that the ineffectiveness of earlier MCU-1 induction may speak to the rate of turnover of MCU-1, and the need for continuous supply of newly synthesized proteins (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1H</xref>). In addition, imaging fluorescently labeled AWC neurons revealed no change in morphology from wild type to mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Fig S1</xref>), adding to the evidence that the role of MCU-1 in odor learning is post-developmental. Thus, MCU-1 is required at the adult stage for odor learning.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2d">
<title>Aversive learning defect in <italic>mcu-1</italic> is specific to 60 min conditioning</title>
<p>In aversive odor learning, attractiveness to an odor progressively declines with longer pre-exposure, or conditioning, time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Lee <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>). For AWC-mediated odor learning, some of these steps are molecularly distinct: learning to 30 min conditioning requires <italic>cng-3</italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">O’Halloran <italic>et al</italic>., 2017</xref>), and further decrease in CI after 60 min or more requires translocation of the cGMP-dependent protein kinase EGL-4 into the nucleus(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Lee <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>To further characterize the learning defect of <italic>mcu-1</italic> mutants, we tested different conditioning times ranging from 30 to 120 min (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). At 30 min conditioning, both wild type and <italic>mcu-1</italic> mutant strain showed a modest decrease in attraction (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B,C</xref>). At 60 min pre-exposure, wild type showed further decrease in CI, whereas <italic>mcu-1</italic> mutants remained at the 30 min level. However, after 90 min and beyond, both wild type and <italic>mcu-1</italic> worms similarly displayed a much lower CI close to 0. The pattern was observed for both butanone and benzaldehyde (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B,C</xref>). Although 90 min exposure to benzaldehyde resulted in slightly lower CI in <italic>mcu-1</italic> mutants than in wild type, in other trials this difference was not as pronounced (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>). Thus, to our surprise, the learning defect was specific to 60 min conditioning, but dispensable for shorter and longer conditioning times.</p>

<title>MCU function is required at the time of conditioning</title>
<p>Earlier, we found that MCU-1 expression is required post-developmentally for odor learning. To further narrow down when MCU-1 function is needed, we used ruthenium red and RU360, pharmacological blockers of MCU(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Ying <italic>et al</italic>, 1991</xref>). When added to the odor solution during conditioning, we found that both ruthenium red and RU360 mimicked the <italic>mcu-1</italic> mutant phenotype: treatment during 60 min pre-exposure inhibited odor learning, but treatment during 90 min pre-exposure yielded normal odor learning indistinguishable from wild type (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2D</xref>). Thus, pharmacological blockers of MCU can be used to reproduce <italic>mcu-1</italic> mutant phenotype, and MCU-1 function is needed at the time of conditioning for successful odor learning.</p>

<title>MCU mediates NLP-1 neuropeptide secretion from AWC</title>
<p>While it was surprising that MCU-1 was required for learning to a specific length of conditioning time, a similar learning defect had been described previously for another mutant. Chalasani <italic>et al</italic>. had reported that mutant of a neuropeptide gene <italic>nlp-1</italic> showed defective aversive learning for isoamylalcohol, another AWC-sensed odor(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Chalasani <italic>et al</italic>, 2010</xref>). Interestingly, the learning defect was also specific for 60 min conditioning, as mutants showed normal learning for 90 min conditioning(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Chalasani <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>). NLP-1 is expressed in many neurons, including AWC(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Nathoo <italic>et al</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Taylor <italic>et al</italic>, 2021</xref>). Conducting the same aversive learning experiment on <italic>nlp-1</italic> mutants, but with butanone, confirmed their results (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2D</xref>). This suggested that <italic>mcu-1</italic> and <italic>nlp-1</italic> may be acting through the same pathway.</p>
<p>One likely possibility was that MCU-1 in the AWC is involved in NLP-1 secretion from the same neuron. To test this, we generated a transgenic strain that expressed Venus-tagged NLP-1 in the AWC neurons. The fluorescently tagged NLP-1 is not functional, but it is secreted into the body cavity, accumulating in the scavenging coelomocytes, whose fluorescence can be used as a proxy for neuropeptide secretion (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Sieburth <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>).</p>

<p>We first tested whether activating MCU causes NLP-1 secretion. For this, we treated wild-type worms with a MCU activator, kaempferol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Montero <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>). After 10 min treatment with kaempferol, we found a significant increase in the fluorescent signal in the coelomocytes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3B</xref>). Kaempferol treatment in <italic>mcu-1</italic> mutants, as expected, did not result in fluorescence increase, showing that activation of MCU, and thus calcium influx into the mitochondria, is required for NLP-1 release (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3B</xref>). Interestingly, MCU activation does not result in increased secretion of all neuropeptides from AWC, as no change in fluorescence was observed when another highly expressed neuropeptide, NLP-3 secretion, was monitored (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3C</xref>).</p>

<title>Prolonged odor exposure leads to NLP-1 secretion from AWC</title>
<p>If ectopic activation of MCU results in NLP-1 secretion, can we observe the same in response to a natural stimulus, such as 60 min odor conditioning? To find out, we exposed the NLP-1::Venus transgenic strain to butanone for either 30 or 60 min. We found that wild-type worms exposed to butanone for 60 min showed increased fluorescence in the coelomocyte, whereas no increase was observed after 30 min exposure (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3D</xref>). This indicates that NLP-1 is secreted only after prolonged odor exposure, and 30 min is insufficient. When we tested <italic>mcu-1</italic> mutant worms, they did not show any increase in fluorescence in response to butanone regardless of exposure time (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3D</xref>). These results were all consistent with the learning defect of <italic>nlp-1</italic> and <italic>mcu-1</italic> mutants, which are defective only for aversive learning to 60 min conditioning. Does NLP-1 secretion in response to prolonged odor conditioning require MCU function? To find out, we treated NLP-1::Venus worms with the MCU blocker RU360 during 60 min odor conditioning. In the presence of the MCU blocker, there was no increase in fluorescence in the coelomocytes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>). Taken together, our results show that odor exposure of 60 min, but not 30 min, causes secretion of NLP-1 from AWC, in an MCU-dependent manner.</p>

<title>mtROS is required for NLP-1 secretion and odor learning</title>
<p>How does MCU-1 mediate NLP-1 secretion? Calcium influx into the mitochondria stimulates ATP production as well as ROS production, both of which can support synaptic signaling(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Jia &amp; Sieburth, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Rangaraju <italic>et al</italic>., 2014</xref>). Since a previous <italic>C. elegans</italic> study had shown that <italic>mcu-1</italic> was required for mtROS-mediated neuropeptide secretion from a pair of interneurons, we wondered whether NLP-1 secretion from the AWC sensory neuron was occurring through a similar mechanism(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Jia &amp; Sieburth, 2021</xref>).</p>
<p>To directly verify whether 60 min butanone exposure results in ROS production at the mitochondria, we generated a transgenic strain that expressed the mitochondrially targeted fluorescent ROS sensor mito-roGFP in the AWC neurons. We exposed the transgenic strain with butanone for 60 min and assessed the redox ratio of roGFP. We also exposed the strain to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> for 10 min as positive control. We then assessed whether increased oxidation could be seen after each treatment. We specifically looked at mitochondria in the axons, since axonal mitochondria is known to be responsible for synaptic signaling and neuropeptide secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Jia &amp; Sieburth, 2021</xref>). In both conditions, mitochondria in the AWC axons indeed showed increased oxidation (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). Thus, prolonged odor stimulus causes ROS generation in the mitochondria of the sensory neuron.</p>

</fig>
<p>Next, we reasoned that if mtROS is required for NLP-1 secretion, then treating with antioxidants that neutralize ROS should prevent its secretion. We therefore treated worms with N-acyl cysteine (NAC), a general antioxidant, or mitoTEMPO, which specifically scavenges mitochondrial ROS, during odor conditioning. Consistent with our hypothesis, worms treated with either NAC or mitoTEMPO failed to show NLP-1::Venus accumulation in the coelomocytes (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>). Consistently, NAC and mitoTEMPO were also effective in preventing odor learning at 60 min, whereas it had no effect on 90 min learning, exactly matching the <italic>mcu-1</italic> mutant phenotype (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>). Thus, mtROS is required for NLP-1 secretion, as well as 60-min odor learning.</p>
<p>Superoxide anions are the most abundant ROS produced by the mitochondria and is quickly converted into H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> by superoxide dismutase (SOD)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Zorov <italic>et al</italic>, 2014</xref>). H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> can alter activities of target enzymes by modifying the thiols of cysteine residues(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Veal <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>). Therefore, we next asked whether adding H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> or inducing cell-specific mtROS would cause NLP-1 secretion without the prolonged odor exposure. To do this, NLP-1::Venus worms were treated with 5 mM H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> for 10 min and coelomocyte fluorescence was measured. We found that 10 min H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> treatment was sufficient to induce NLP-1 secretion (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>). Moreover, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> treatment of the <italic>mcu-1</italic> mutant was also sufficient to induce NLP-1 secretion (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>). This contrasts with the earlier kaempferol treatment, which was not effective in <italic>mcu-1</italic> mutants (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). This shows that H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production occurs downstream of MCU activation and calcium influx into the mitochondria.</p>
<p>To achieve precise mtROS generation only in the AWC neuron, we expressed the light-activated singlet oxygen generator, miniSOG, in the AWC mitochondria. When illuminated by blue light, ROS produced by miniSOG causes cell death in the cells that express it, making it a useful tool for cell ablation. However, shorter illumination can be used for ROS generation without causing cell ablation(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Jia &amp; Sieburth, 2021</xref>). When the transgenic strain was crossed with the nlp-1::Venus strain, we found that the double transgenic strain showed markedly higher Venus fluorescence in the coelomocytes (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>). Thus, mtROS in AWC can induce NLP-1 secretion from the same neuron.</p>

<title>Coincidental activation of MCU and odor exposure accelerates odor learning</title>
<p>Our data so far suggest that prolonged exposure to AWC<sup>ON</sup>-specific odors cause MCU activation, causing calcium influx and mtROS production, which is required for 60-min odor learning. Based on this, we hypothesized that if we ectopically induce mtROS, odor learning can happen with only a brief exposure to odor. Normally, 10 min of butanone conditioning results in only a slight decrease in CI (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4G</xref>). However, we found that the same treatment in worms expressing mito-miniSOG in AWC neurons produced a sharp decline in CI that is close to zero. This was dependent on light-activated mtROS generation by miniSOG, as the same procedure conducted without light illumination showed CI similar to that of wild type (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4G</xref>). Also, mito-miniSOG worms conditioned in buffer without odor showed normal chemotaxis, demonstrating that odor must be presented simultaneously with mtROS for learning to occur.</p>
<p>Similarly, simultaneous activation of MCU with odor exposure also accelerated odor learning. Treating worms with kaempferol alone for 10 min resulted in high CI identical to naïve worms, showing that MCU activation and NLP-1 secretion alone is not sufficient to produce decreased attraction to odors. However, when kaempferol was added together with butanone for 10 min, worms exhibited a far lower CI that is typical of 60-min conditioning (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5A</xref>). Taken together, when odor stimulus is paired with MCU activation, which produces mtROS, which in turn causes NLP-1 secretion, aversive odor learning is accelerated.</p>

<title>MCU-1 function is required at the end of conditioning</title>
<p>Finally, we asked at what point during odor conditioning MCU is activated. This was because NLP-1 release is observed only after 60 min odor stimulus but not after 30 min (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3D</xref>). How does the neuron respond differently to 30-min versus 60-min conditioning? Is the neuropeptide secreted in small quantities throughout the duration of conditioning, accumulating to a critical level that leads to learning, or is it released all at one time only after 60-min odor stimulus? One thing to consider is that the AWC sensory neuron is an “odor-OFF” neuron – it is inhibited by odor stimulus, and activated when the odor is removed(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Chalasani <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>). This implies that whether an odor is given 30 min or 60 min, there is only one calcium transient occurring at the end when the odor is finally removed. Since synaptic activity is usually associated with an active neuron, we hypothesized that MCU activation, and thus NLP-1 secretion, also occurs at the end of the stimulus.</p>
<p>To test this, we used RU360 to block MCU at specific time points during odor conditioning and tested their behavior (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5C</xref>). Adding and removing MCU inhibitor RU360 in the first or last half of pre-exposure showed that blocking MCU during the second half of odor conditioning tended to suppress aversive learning (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5C</xref>). Furthermore, blocking MCU function during the last 15 min was sufficient to prevent odor learning. This suggested that MCU function was required at the end of odor exposure, which coincides with the timing of the calcium transient that appears upon odor removal. When RU360 was added during the washing step immediately after odor exposure, it had no effect on odor learning (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5C</xref>). This was not surprising, as there is likely a significant time delay for the inhibitor to reach the neuron.</p>
<p>Finally, we tested whether the adding RU360 at the end of odor conditioning prevented NLP-1::Venus secretion. Consistent with their chemotaxis behavior, worms that were supplemented with RU360 during the last 15 min of odor conditioning failed to show NLP-1::Venus accumulation in the coelomocytes (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5D</xref>). These results strongly suggest that MCU-mediated calcium influx, as well as NLP-1 secretion, takes place at the end of 60 min conditioning, likely at the time of AWC calcium transient upon odor removal (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5E</xref>). Since calcium transient occurs whether after 30 min or 60 min odor stimulus, this hints at a mechanism to selectively activate MCU in response to prolonged odor conditioning.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Mitochondrial dysfunction is known to accompany many psychiatric, neurological, and neurodegenerative disorders. However, mechanistic studies on how the dysfunctions contribute to these disorders are lacking. Our findings identify a specific aspect of mitochondria function – control of calcium influx and mtROS production – that contributes to normal brain function and behavior.</p>
<p>In this study, we showed that MCU-1, and thus mitochondrial calcium, contributes to behavioral plasticity in <italic>C. elegans</italic> by regulating neuropeptide release at the sensory neuron. We found that <italic>mcu-</italic>1 mutants are defective for 60 min aversive odor learning, and this was due to lack of NLP-1 secretion that normally occur after 60 min odor conditioning. Odor learning and NLP-1 secretion required MCU activity and mtROS production in the sensory neuron at the time of conditioning. Correspondingly, ectopic MCU activation or mtROS during odor exposure accelerated learning. Furthermore, we showed evidence that MCU activation and NLP-1 secretion occur at the same time as the AWC calcium transient, which hints at a mechanism to selectively activate MCU in response to prolonged odor conditioning. The study shows that mitochondria in neurons play a direct role in determining the composition of synaptic signals during neuronal activity – whether to release a specific neuropeptide in addition to the classical neurotransmitter. The release of this neuropeptide alters the animal’s behavior to display the appropriate level of response to the experienced odor.</p>
<p>A previous study in Drosophila also reported odor memory defects in MCU mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Drago &amp; Davis, 2016</xref>). However, in flies, MCU was required for the proper development of the mushroom body neurons, and thus silencing MCU after pupation had no effect on memory. This demonstrates the many roles mitochondria and mitochondrial calcium play in different systems and organisms, and highlight the benefit of studying gene function in multiple model organisms.</p>

<title>MCU responds to conditioning duration</title>
<p>Since its molecular identity was discovered, studies have identified various regulatory mechanisms of MCU function. In addition to the pore-forming subunit MCU-1, the MCU complex includes auxiliary subunits MICU and EMRE that regulate channel activity. MICU senses calcium through its EF-hand domain, causing MCU to open in response to cytoplasmic calcium increase(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Vais <italic>et al</italic>, 2020</xref>). Consistently, simultaneous imaging of cytoplasmic and mitochondrial calcium in neurons shows mitochondrial calcium influx occurring concurrently with cytoplasmic calcium increase(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Katsenelson <italic>et al</italic>, 2022</xref>). In addition to MICU and EMRE, additional factors were found to regulate MCU activity in mice studies, such as CAMKII, MCUR1, or mitochondrially localized IGFR, suggesting that MCU responds to multiple cues in addition to cytoplasmic calcium concentration(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Katsenelson <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Lin <italic>et al</italic>, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Vais <italic>et al</italic>, 2015</xref>). This is consistent with the emerging view that MCU-mediated calcium influx is selective, occurring in response to more significant changes in cellular activity. Multiple studies show that mitochondrial calcium influx is usually coupled to either stronger electrical stimulation of the cell or localized cytoplasmic calcium increase(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Alvarez-Illera <italic>et al</italic>, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Csordas <italic>et al</italic>, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Doser <italic>et al</italic>, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Groten &amp; MacVicar, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Katsenelson <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Lin <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Stoler <italic>et al</italic>, 2022</xref>).</p>
<p>Our results indicate that MCU activity in the AWC neuron represents a threshold for the difference between 30 min and 60 min aversive odor learning. This suggests that MCU, and hence mitochondrial calcium entry, may act as a duration sensor for sensory conditioning (Fig 6F). How may this occur? Contrary to most other sensory stimuli, extended odor stimulation in the AWC is characterized by prolonged inactivity rather than activity. However, a careful characterization of AWC calcium response has previously shown that progressively longer odor exposure time from 10 s, 1 min, to 3 min, resulted in a progressively faster and higher calcium spike at the synaptic terminal upon odor removal(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Ventimiglia &amp; Bargmann, 2017</xref>). This shows that cytoplasmic calcium can potentially reflect the duration of odor stimulation. Whether this also applies to 30 min and 60 min odor exposure remains to be seen, but it is one possible way that different durations of odor stimulation could be signaled in the cell.</p>
<p>In <italic>C. elegans</italic> neurons, it was previously shown that mitochondrial H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> increases the release of the neuropeptide FLP-1 from the AIY neuron, inducing the oxidative stress response in peripheral tissues(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Jia &amp; Sieburth, 2021</xref>). The study showed that different bacterial diets, thus internal metabolic cues, can cause mitochondrial calcium influx, as well as mtROS and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production, from the AIY axonal mitochondria. Our study adds to the evidence that this mechanism of neuropeptide secretion may be a general process that occurs in other neurons in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, and in response to a wider variety of cues beyond metabolic, such as odor stimuli. We note, however, that internal metabolic cues may still be involved in this case, as aversive odor conditioning requires food deprivation. Past studies show that insulin-like signaling mediates the response to starvation and that this is required for aversive odor learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Cho <italic>et al</italic>, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Lin <italic>et al</italic>, 2010</xref>). If so, this suggests the possibility of AWC mitochondria acting as an intersectional hub to integrate sensory information and internal metabolic states.</p>

<p>Mitochondrial calcium influx is a prerequisite for hormone secretion in endocrine cells, most notably insulin from pancreatic ý cells(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Quan <italic>et al</italic>, 2015</xref>). In ý cells, glucose uptake and subsequent metabolic processes trigger mitochondrial calcium influx, as part of a process known as metabolism-secretion coupling(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Maechler <italic>et al</italic>, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Wiederkehr <italic>et al</italic>, 2011</xref>).

<p>Neurons often express several neuropeptides but whether they are co-released or controlled individually is not well understood.

Our study suggests one possible mechanism of differential release. We show that the release of another highly expressed neuropeptide, NLP-3, does not respond to MCU activation. Similar selectivity in neuropeptide release was also observed in the AIY interneuron of <italic>C. elegans</italic>, where mtROS caused the release of the FMRFamide-like neuropeptide FLP-1 but not FLP-18(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Jia &amp; Sieburth, 2021</xref>).

<title>Neuronal mitochondria and behavior</title>
<p>Mitochondria carry out a range of functions, from energy production, calcium buffering, lipid biosynthesis, ROS signaling, to signaling cell death. In cells with extreme structural polarity such as neurons, these range of functions often serve many compartment-specific roles, adding to the complexity of their function. Understanding the varied roles of mitochondria in neurons will help illuminate its contribution to various psychiatric, neurological, and neurodegenerative diseases. One study that directly linked mitochondrial function to behavior showed that reduced function and altered structure of mitochondria in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) result in reduced social dominance in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Hollis <italic>et al</italic>, 2015</xref>).

Finally, this effect could be blocked by blocking complex I function in the NAc.

RNAi plates were prepared as previously described(Ahringer). Permeabilization of cuticle did not affect their behavior (data not shown). Following are the stock solutions used: 6.358 mM Ruthenium Red in water (Millipore), 0.5 mg/mL RU360 (Millipore) in deoxygenated water, 50 mM of Kaempferol (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) in EtOH, 50 mM of Juglone (Sigma-Aldrich) in DMSO, 100 mM of N-Acetyl-L-Cysteine (BioBasic) in water, 18.938 mM of mitoTEMPO (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) in DMSO, and 30% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (Sigma-Aldrich). For behavior assay, about 1000 adults worms were transferred into a 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube with S-basal, and washed three times. Pharmacological treatments were added to washed worms at final concentration of 100 μM for Ruthenium Red, 0.5 μM for RU360, 100 μM for Kaempferol, 300 μM for Juglone, 0.5 mM for N-Acetyl-L-Cysteine, 10 μM for mitoTEMPO, and 5 mM H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>.</p>

<title>Microscopy and analysis</title>
<p>All images were obtained using Zeiss LSM800 confocal microscope with Zeiss C-Apochromat 40x/1.2 W Korr objective and ZEN 2.6 software. For coelomocyte imaging, 30–40 L4 stage animals were collected from NGM plates, washed three times, and exposed to either butanone (1:10,000 in S-basal) for 1 hr or to each pharmacological treatment for 10 min in S-basal. After treatment, worms were briefly washed, then paralyzed using sodium azide and mounted on 2% agarose pads. All coelomocytes along the length of the worm was imaged. Maximum intensity projection was obtained using image stacks and used for analysis. Fluorescence was quantified by manually delineating each coelomocyte using the polygon selection tool and measuring the integrated density in ImageJ.</p>
<p>For the mito-miniSOG strain, we found that even ambient light was enough to significantly increase NLP-1::Venus in the coelomocytes. Worms were grown in plates wrapped in foil to prevent excess light exposure, but light exposure was inevitable during microscopic analyses. We also confirmed that, although ambient light produces ROS, only strong blue light (30 min) was able to induce AWC ablation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Figure S2</xref>).</p>
<p>To image mito-roGFP and calculate reduction/oxidation ratios, worms were imaged at two different wavelengths for excitation, 488/405 for the reduced/oxidized (R/O) ratio(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Vevea <italic>et al</italic>, 2013</xref>). Maximum intensity projection was obtained for each image. After setting the ROI for each mitochondrion in image J, the fluorescence intensity of the reduced mitochondria was measured, and the same ROI is applied to the oxidized mitochondria to obtain the ratio of 2 stacks after subtracting the background value from the two values. To observe the range of roGFP redox ratios, 5 mM H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> for 10 min was used.</p>

<title>Calcium Imaging and analysis</title>
<p>Worms were immobilized in a poly(dimethylsioloxane) (PDMS) microfluidic chamber described previously(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Chronis <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>). Using the microfluidic chamber design generously provided by the Bargmann lab, the SU-8 micro mold and PDMS chip were constructed by MicroFit (Hanam, Republic of Korea). Day 1 adult worms were transferred to unseeded plates to clean bacteria off the body, then transported to the chamber in S-basal buffer via polyethylene tubing (Intramedic). Benzaldehyde at 1:100,000 dilution was used for imaging. GCaMP fluorescence was visualized at 40x magnification using IX-73 inverted fluorescent microscope (Olympus) attached to Iris 9 sCMOS camera (Photometrics) and a pE-800 LED illuminator (CoolLED). Fluorescence was recorded using MetaFluor 3.1 at approximately 5 frames/s. Resulting image sequence was processed using the Fiji software (NIH). ROI was aligned using the ‘align slices in stack’ function of the Template Matching plugin, then pixel intensity of AWC cell body was measured.</p>

<p>This study presents <bold>important</bold> findings that will allow for a better understanding of the role of mitochondria in behaviours of C. elegans. There is <bold>convincing</bold> evidence that mutants in a subunit of the mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU-1) show defects in olfactory adaptation and this gene regulates neuropeptide secretion and allows for behavioural modulation in C. elegans. However, the evidence that mitochondrial calcium modulates odour-based behaviour in C. elegans is <bold>incomplete</bold>. This claim would require support from calcium imaging in conditioned WT and mcu-1 animals. This work would be of interest to labs working on behaviours across phyla.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Here the authors present their evidence linking the mitochondrial uniporter (MCU-1) and olfactory adaptation in C. elegans. They clearly demonstrate a behavioral defect of mcu-1 mutants in adaptation over 60 minutes and present evidence that this gene functions in the AWC primary sensory neurons at, or close to, the time of adaptation.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The paper is very well organized and their approach to unpacking the role of mcu-1 mutants in olfactory adaptation is very reasonable. The authors lean into diverse techniques including behavior, genetics, and pharmacological manipulation in order to flesh out their model for how MCU-1 functions in AWC neurons with respect to olfaction.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>I would like to see the authors strengthen the link between mitochondrial calcium and olfactory adaptation. The authors present some gCaMP data in Figure 5 but it is unclear to me why this tool is not better utilized to explore the mechanism of MCU-1 activity. I think this is very important as the title of the paper states that &quot;mitochondrial calcium modulates..&quot; behavior in AWC and so it would be nice to see more evidence to support this direct connection. I would also like to see the authors place their findings into a model based on previous findings and perhaps examine whether mcu-1 is required for EGL-4 nuclear translocation, which would be straightforward to examine.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In their manuscript, &quot;Mitochondrial calcium modulates odor-mediated behavioural plasticity in C. elegans&quot;, Lee et al. aim to link a mitochondrial calcium transporter to higher-order neuronal functions that mediate memory and aversive learning behaviours. The authors characterise the role of the mitochondrial calcium uniporter, and a specific subunit of this complex, MCU-1, within a single chemosensory neuron (AWCOFF) during aversive odor learning in the nematode. By genetically manipulating mcu-1 as well as using pharmacological activators and blockers of MCU activity, the study presents compelling evidence that the activity of this individual mitochondrial ion transporter in AWCOFF is sufficient to drive animal behaviour through aversive memory formation. The authors show that perturbations to mcu-1 and MCU activity prevent aversive learning to several chemical odors associated with food absence. The authors propose a model, experimentally validated at several steps, whereby an increase in MCU activity during odor conditioning stimulates mitochondrial calcium influx and an increase in mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS) production, triggering the release of the neuropeptide NLP-1 from AWC, all of which are required to mediate future avoidance behaviour of the chemical odor.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Overall, the authors provided robust evidence that mitochondrial function, mediated through MCU activity, contributes to behavioural plasticity. They also demonstrated that ectopic MCU activation or mtROS during odor exposure could accelerate learning. This is quite profound, as it highlights the importance of mitochondrial function in complex neuronal processes beyond their general roles in the development and maintenance of neurons through energy homeostasis and biosynthesis, amongst their other cell-non-specific roles.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>While the manuscript is generally robust, there are some concerns that should be addressed to improve the strength of the proposed model:</p>
<p>(1) Throughout the manuscript, it is implied that MCU activation caused by odor conditioning changes mitochondrial calcium levels. However, there is no direct experimental evidence of this. For example, the authors write on p.10 &quot;This shows that H2O2 production occurs downstream of MCU activation and calcium influx into the mitochondria&quot;, and on p. 11, the statement that prolonged exposure to odors causes calcium influx. Because this is a key element of the proposed model, experimental evidence would be required to support it.</p>
<p>(2) Some controls missing, e.g. a heat-shock-only control in WT and mcu-1 (non-transgenic) background in Figure 1h is required to ensure the heat-shock stress does not interfere with odor learning.</p>
<p>(3) Lee et al propose that mcu-1 is required at the adult stage to accomplish odor learning because inducing mcu-1 expression at larval stages did not rescue the phenotype of mcu-1 mutants during adulthood. However, the requirement of MCU for odor learning was narrowed down to a 15' window at the end of odor conditioning (Figure 5c). Is it possible that MCU-1 protein levels decline after larval induction so that MCU-1 is no longer present during adulthood when odor conditioning is performed?</p>
<p>(4) There is a limited learning effect observable after 30 minutes, and a very pronounced effect in all animals after 90 minutes. The authors very carefully dissect the learning mechanism at 60 minutes of exposure and distinguish processes that are relevant at 60 minutes from those important at 30 minutes. Some explanation or speculation as to why the processes crucial at the 60-minute mark are redundant at 90 minutes of exposure would be important.</p>
<p>(5) Given the presumably ubiquitous function of mcu-1/MCU in mitochondrial calcium homeostasis, it is remarkable that its perturbation impacts only a very specific neuronal process in AWC at a very specific time. The authors should elaborate on this surprising aspect of their discovery in the discussion.</p>
<p>(6) Associated with the above comment, it remains possible that mcu-1 is required in coelomocytes for their ability to absorb NLP-1::Venus (Figure 3B), and the AWC-specific role of mcu-1 for this phenotype should be determined.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This manuscript reports a role for the mitochondrial calcium uniporter gene (mcu-1) in regulating associative learning behavior in C. elegans. This regulation occurs by mcu-1-dependent secretion of the neuropeptide NLP-1 from the sensory neuron AWC. The authors report a post-developmental role for mcu-1 in AWC to promote learning. The authors further show that odor conditioning leads to increases in NLP-1 secretion from AWC, and that interfering with mcu-1 function reduces NLP-1 secretion. Finally, the authors show that NLP-1 secretion increases when ROS levels in AWC are genetically or pharmacologically elevated. The authors propose that mitochondrial calcium entry through MCU-1 in response to odor conditioning leads to the generation of ROS and the subsequent increase in neuropeptide secretion to promote conditioned behavior.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) The authors show convincingly that genetically or pharmacologically manipulating MCU function impacts chemotaxis in a conditioned learning paradigm.</p>
<p>(2) The demonstration that the secretion of a specific neuropeptide can be up-regulated by MCU, ROS and odor conditioning is an important and interesting advance that addresses mechanisms by which neuropeptide secretion can be regulated in vivo.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) The authors conclusion that mcu-1 functions in the AWC-on neuron is not adequately supported by their rescue experiments. The promoter they use for rescue drives expression in a number of additional neurons including AWC-on, that themselves are implicated in adaptation, leaving open the possibility that mcu-1 may function non-autonomously instead of autonomously in AWC to regulate this behavior.</p>
<p>(2) The authors conclude MCU promotes neuropeptide release from AWC by controlling calcium entry into mitochondria, but they did not directly examine the effects of altered MCU function on calcium dynamics either in mitochondria or in the soma, even though they conducted calcium imaging experiments in AWC of wild type animals. Examination of calcium entry in mitochondria would be a direct test of their model.</p>
<p>(3) The authors' conclusion that mitochondrial-derived ROS produced by MCU activation drives neuropeptide release does not appear to be experimentally supported. A major weakness of this paper is that experiments addressing whether mcu-1 activity indeed produces ROS are not included, leaving unanswered the question of whether MCU is the endogenous source of ROS that drives neuropeptide secretion.</p>

<p>We agree that observing calcium levels inside the mitochondria would conclusively demonstrate that mitochondria calcium directly impacts neuropeptide secretion and behavior. We will try to do this with a mitochondrially targeted calcium indicator. We will also better integrate our findings to existing models in the literature, such as EGL-4 nuclear localization in AWC in response to prolonged odor exposure. Thank you for your comments.</p>

The authors characterise the role of the mitochondrial calcium uniporter, and a specific subunit of this complex, MCU-1, within a single chemosensory neuron (AWCOFF) during aversive odor learning in the nematode. By genetically manipulating mcu-1 as well as using pharmacological activators and blockers of MCU activity, the study presents compelling evidence that the activity of this individual mitochondrial ion transporter in AWCOFF is sufficient to drive animal behaviour through aversive memory formation. The authors show that perturbations to mcu-1 and MCU activity prevent aversive learning to several chemical odors associated with food absence. The authors propose a model, experimentally validated at several steps, whereby an increase in MCU activity during odor conditioning stimulates mitochondrial calcium influx and an increase in mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS) production, triggering the release of the neuropeptide NLP-1 from AWC, all of which are required to mediate future avoidance behaviour of the chemical odor.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Overall, the authors provided robust evidence that mitochondrial function, mediated through MCU activity, contributes to behavioural plasticity. They also demonstrated that ectopic MCU activation or mtROS during odor exposure could accelerate learning. This is quite profound, as it highlights the importance of mitochondrial function in complex neuronal processes beyond their general roles in the development and maintenance of neurons through energy homeostasis and biosynthesis, amongst their other cell-non-specific roles.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>While the manuscript is generally robust, there are some concerns that should be addressed to improve the strength of the proposed model:</p>
<p>(1) Throughout the manuscript, it is implied that MCU activation caused by odor conditioning changes mitochondrial calcium levels. However, there is no direct experimental evidence of this. For example, the authors write on p.10 &quot;This shows that H2O2 production occurs downstream of MCU activation and calcium influx into the mitochondria&quot;, and on p. 11, the statement that prolonged exposure to odors causes calcium influx. Because this is a key element of the proposed model, experimental evidence would be required to support it.</p>

<p>We are planning to measure mitochondrial calcium levels directly by using a mitochondrially targeted calcium indicator. We agree that this is a key element of our model.</p>

<p>(2) Some controls missing, e.g. a heat-shock-only control in WT and mcu-1 (non-transgenic) background in Figure 1h is required to ensure the heat-shock stress does not interfere with odor learning.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We will conduct the experiments again with necessary controls.</p>

<p>(3) Lee et al propose that mcu-1 is required at the adult stage to accomplish odor learning because inducing mcu-1 expression at larval stages did not rescue the phenotype of mcu-1 mutants during adulthood. However, the requirement of MCU for odor learning was narrowed down to a 15' window at the end of odor conditioning (Figure 5c). Is it possible that MCU-1 protein levels decline after larval induction so that MCU-1 is no longer present during adulthood when odor conditioning is performed?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Yes, we also noted that the early induction of MCU-1 is not effective to restore learning, and hypothesized that MCU-1 protein may be subject to high turnover. It may be that MCU-1 induced during larval stages no longer exist by the time odor conditioning is performed, although we have not confirmed this. We had a brief sentence noting this in the discussion section, but we will discuss this a little further in the revision. Thank you.</p>

<p>(4) There is a limited learning effect observable after 30 minutes, and a very pronounced effect in all animals after 90 minutes. The authors very carefully dissect the learning mechanism at 60 minutes of exposure and distinguish processes that are relevant at 60 minutes from those important at 30 minutes. Some explanation or speculation as to why the processes crucial at the 60-minute mark are redundant at 90 minutes of exposure would be important.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>I think this is in line with Reviewer #1’s comments that we should discuss our findings more in relation to existing models in the literature. We will do this in our revision.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) Given the presumably ubiquitous function of mcu-1/MCU in mitochondrial calcium homeostasis, it is remarkable that its perturbation impacts only a very specific neuronal process in AWC at a very specific time. The authors should elaborate on this surprising aspect of their discovery in the discussion.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We will discuss the implication further in our revised manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(6) Associated with the above comment, it remains possible that mcu-1 is required in coelomocytes for their ability to absorb NLP-1::Venus (Figure 3B), and the AWC-specific role of mcu-1 for this phenotype should be determined.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>To confirm that mcu-1 is not required for coelomocyte uptake, we can stimulate NLP-1:Venus secretion in mcu-1 worms by adding H2O2, then observe whether Venus is observed in the coelomocytes. We will include this in our revised manuscript. Thank you for your comments.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This manuscript reports a role for the mitochondrial calcium uniporter gene (mcu-1) in regulating associative learning behavior in C. elegans. This regulation occurs by mcu-1-dependent secretion of the neuropeptide NLP-1 from the sensory neuron AWC. The authors report a post-developmental role for mcu-1 in AWC to promote learning. The authors further show that odor conditioning leads to increases in NLP-1 secretion from AWC, and that interfering with mcu-1 function reduces NLP-1 secretion. Finally, the authors show that NLP-1 secretion increases when ROS levels in AWC are genetically or pharmacologically elevated. The authors propose that mitochondrial calcium entry through MCU-1 in response to odor conditioning leads to the generation of ROS and the subsequent increase in neuropeptide secretion to promote conditioned behavior.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) The authors show convincingly that genetically or pharmacologically manipulating MCU function impacts chemotaxis in a conditioned learning paradigm.</p>
<p>(2) The demonstration that the secretion of a specific neuropeptide can be up-regulated by MCU, ROS and odor conditioning is an important and interesting advance that addresses mechanisms by which neuropeptide secretion can be regulated in vivo.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) The authors conclusion that mcu-1 functions in the AWC-on neuron is not adequately supported by their rescue experiments. The promoter they use for rescue drives expression in a number of additional neurons including AWC-on, that themselves are implicated in adaptation, leaving open the possibility that mcu-1 may function non-autonomously instead of autonomously in AWC to regulate this behavior.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We recognized this as well, and we now have a promoter construct more specific to AWCON (str-2). Using this more specific promoter, we will confirm that the role of mcu-1 is indeed AWCON-specific in our revised manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) The authors conclude MCU promotes neuropeptide release from AWC by controlling calcium entry into mitochondria, but they did not directly examine the effects of altered MCU function on calcium dynamics either in mitochondria or in the soma, even though they conducted calcium imaging experiments in AWC of wild type animals. Examination of calcium entry in mitochondria would be a direct test of their model.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree. As we stated above for reviewer #1 and #2, we will include results from the mitochondrial calcium data in our revised manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) The authors' conclusion that mitochondrial-derived ROS produced by MCU activation drives neuropeptide release does not appear to be experimentally supported. A major weakness of this paper is that experiments addressing whether mcu-1 activity indeed produces ROS are not included, leaving unanswered the question of whether MCU is the endogenous source of ROS that drives neuropeptide secretion.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We can confirm this using mitochondrially targeted redox indicator roGFP, and we will be sure to include the data in the revised manuscript. Thank you for your comments.</p>
