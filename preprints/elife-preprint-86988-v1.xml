<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Declines in biodiversity generated by anthropogenic stressors at both species and population levels can alter emergent processes instrumental to ecosystem function and resilience. As such, understanding the role of biodiversity in ecosystem function and its response to climate perturbation is increasingly important, especially in tropical systems where responses to changes in biodiversity are less predictable and more challenging to assess experimentally. Using large scale transplant experiments conducted at five neotropical sites, we documented the impacts of changes in intraspecific and interspecific plant richness in the genus <italic>Piper</italic> on insect herbivory, insect richness, and ecosystem resilience to perturbations in water availability. We found that reductions of both intraspecific and interspecific <italic>Piper</italic> diversity had dramatic and site specific effects on herbivory, herbivorous insect richness, and plant mortality. Ecosystem responses to reduced intraspecific richness were often similar in magnitude to responses to reduced interspecific richness. Increased water availability reduced herbivory by 4.2% overall, and the response of herbivorous insect richness and herbivory to water availability was altered by both intra and interspecific richness in a site contingent manner. Our results underscore the role of intraspecific and interspecific richness as foundations of ecosystem function, and the importance of community specific contingencies in controlling function in complex tropical systems.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>As climate change and anthropogenic activity alter ecosystems at unprecedented rates, it has become critical to understand the consequences of biodiversity loss on ecosystem processes and the maintenance of ecosystem processes through species interactions. A complex mix of anthropogenic forces are eroding multiple dimensions of global biological diversity, including plant intraspecific, interspecific, and functional diversity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>). Plant diversity affects herbivore abundance and diversity, thereby influencing biomass allocation and energy fluxes between trophic levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>). Because losses of plant diversity can destabilize the flow of resources to higher trophic levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>), understanding the connection between biodiversity and trophic interactions is necessary to predict the consequences of the loss of primary producer biodiversity on ecosystem traits such as resilience to environmental perturbation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>). While climate change is associated with increased absolute precipitation in some regions and decreased precipitation in others, IPCC models predict mid-century increases in the frequency of extreme precipitation events in Central and South America (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>), a phenomenon already observable in many ecosystems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>). Measuring how precipitation change will affect the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem function is therefore increasingly important, particularly in diverse tropical systems.</p>
<p>Very few multi-site, manipulative diversity experiments have been reported from tropical areas compared to temperate environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>), limiting our knowledge of the role of biodiversity in ecosystem function in the most species-rich regions of the planet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>). Here we investigate how multiple dimensions of plant diversity affect herbivory and plant mortality at five neotropical sites and explore how diversity modulates ecosystem responses to changes in water availability at three of those sites, in the context of several established hypotheses (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbls1">Table S1</xref>). By altering plant uptake of nutrients and the induction of plant defenses, abnormal levels of precipitation can alter herbivore pressure, acting to alter the movement of resources into higher trophic levels. As such, climate extremes of dry and wet periods are expected to strongly perturb plant-insect interactions and thereby alter ecosystem function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>). The insurance hypothesis suggests that greater biodiversity can act to stabilize ecosystems and improve their resilience to environmental change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>). Despite traditional views that interspecific richness has a greater impact on ecosystem processes than intraspecific diversity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>), recent research suggests that plant intra- and interspecific richness can have similar effects on ecosystem productivity and consumer abundance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>), and field studies have demonstrated both positive and neutral effects of plant diversity on ecosystem resilience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>).</p>
<p>To test the insurance hypothesis, the effects of water addition on ecosystem function, and the relative strength of intra- and interspecific richness in driving ecosystem function, we conducted common garden experiments at five sites across Central and South America. Using 33 species in the genus <italic>Piper</italic> (Piperaceae) as a model system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>), we manipulated intra- and interspecific plant richness in Costa Rica, Ecuador, Peru, and two sites in Brazil. We additionally manipulated water availability in Costa Rica, Ecuador, and Peru (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figs. 1</xref> &amp; S1 A). We predicted that reduced <italic>Piper</italic> diversity would lead to reduced diversity in higher trophic levels, that water addition would lead to altered herbivore pressure, and that lower <italic>Piper</italic> diversity would be associated with more extreme changes in herbivory and plant mortality in response to water addition. Additionally, we predicted that changes in intraspecific plant richness would affect ecosystem function with magnitudes similar to interspecific richness.</p>

<title>Study sites and focal plant genus</title>
<p>We conducted a large-scale transplant experiment replicated across five sites spanning 42° latitude in the Neotropics (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> &amp; <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbls2">Table S2</xref> and encompassing a range in annual precipitation from 1271 mm to 4495 mm (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbls2">Table S2</xref>). At each site, we studied herbivory on planted individuals in the genus <italic>Piper</italic> (Piperaceae) in response to experimental treatments. Study sites included lowland equatorial humid forest at La Selva Biological Station, Costa Rica; high elevation equatorial humid forest in Yanayacu Biological Station, Ecuador; high elevation equatorial humid forest at El Fundo Génova, Peru; lowland seasonally dry gallery forest in cerrado within the phytogeographic domain of the Atlantic Forest in Mogi-Guaçu Biological Reserve, Brazil; and lowland seasonally semideciduous forest in the transition between the Atlantic Forest and the Cerrado phytogeographic domains in Uaimii State Forest, Brazil. Climate classifications follow the Köppen-Geiger climate model (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbls2">Table S2</xref>; 22).</p>
<p>Multiple species of <italic>Piper</italic> are found at all sites, ranging from 11 species in Mogi-Guaçu to 50 species in Costa Rica (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>). <italic>Piper</italic> is an ideal genus for large-scale comparative studies, as it is found across the Neotropics and subtropics, from ∼10° N to about ∼32° S. In addition to being widespread, <italic>Piper</italic> is abundant and diverse across its range, encompassing ∼1000 species in the Neotropics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>). <italic>Piper</italic> has been the subject of detailed studies of herbivory, and its herbivore fauna has been surveyed across its range (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>). Members of the genus host both specialist caterpillars and beetles as well as generalist caterpillars and Orthopterans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>,26–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>). Leaf damage patterns produced by the different classes of herbivores are well documented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>)</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2b">
<title>Experimental design</title>
<p>At each study site, a factorial experiment was implemented to test the effects of plant intraspecific and interspecific richness on herbivory, variation in herbivory, and insect richness. Experimental plants were propagated from cuttings of naturally occurring <italic>Piper</italic> plants (typically with three nodes and zero to one leaves). In Costa Rica, Ecuador, and Peru a water addition treatment was also tested. In all sites except Uaimii, experimental plots measured 4 m in diameter and contained 12 <italic>Piper</italic> individuals, planted either in pots with locally derived soil (for experiments manipulating water availability) or directly into the ground (for experiments without water additions in Mogi-Guaçu and Uaimii; <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbls2">Table S2</xref>). Plots in Uaimii were 2 m in diameter and contained six <italic>Piper</italic> individuals, limited by the number of cuttings available. Plants were cultivated without fertilizer or irrigation.</p>
<p>The interspecific richness treatment had three levels at all sites except Uaimii, where there were only two levels due to limited numbers of cuttings. At each site a subset of naturally occurring <italic>Piper</italic> species was selected to act as a species pool for each experimental plot (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbls3">Table S3</xref>). These species were selected to constitute a breadth of genetic and functional diversity representative of the <italic>Piper</italic> community present at each site. Combinations of species in each plot for each level of the interspecific richness treatment were selected randomly from these species pools. The first level was a monoculture of <italic>Piper</italic> consisting of individuals of a single species. In the second level, two <italic>Piper</italic> species were randomly selected for planting (e.g. six individuals of each species). These species combinations were the same when crossed with the low and high levels of the intraspecific richness treatment (see below). In the high interspecific richness plots, the number of species varied between sites and included all <italic>Piper</italic> species available to produce cuttings (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbls1">Table S1</xref>–<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbls2">Table S2</xref>). The minimum number of <italic>Piper</italic> species in a high richness plot was three in Uaimii, and the maximum was 12 in Costa Rica and Ecuador. Due to the low number of species available in Uaimii no two-species plots were planted. The interspecific richness treatment was replicated three times per site. In Mogi-Guaçu and Uaimii, each replicate contained a monoculture plot for each species.</p>
<p>An intraspecific richness treatment with two levels (clones taken from a single mother plant or individual cuttings all taken from unique mother plants) was crossed with the interspecific richness treatment. In Costa Rica and Ecuador, the high interspecific richness plots only included individuals from unique mother plants because 12 different species were planted. In Mogi-Guaçu and Uaimii, the experiments were fully crossed. In the high intraspecific richness treatment, cuttings were from different <italic>Piper</italic> individuals growing at least 10 m apart, so they were not from the same root system are were most likely genetically unique individuals.</p>
<p>A water addition treatment was crossed with the inter- and intraspecific richness treatments in Costa Rica, Ecuador, and Peru in order to examine how IPCC predicted regional mid-century increases in precipitation in these regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>) may affect herbivory and trophic interactions. Plants were cultivated in five to six liter pots with drainage holes. Each potted plant under the water addition treatment was watered with an extra 2 L of water twice per month in Costa Rica and Ecuador. In Peru, 2 L of water were added to plants every three months. Water was rapidly applied as a flooding event to completely saturate the soil. All low richness plantings in Peru were watered, but in Costa Rica and Ecuador the low richness plantings were not watered, so only two levels of the species richness treatment were crossed with the water treatment (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figs. 1</xref> &amp; S1 A). Plant cultivation periods lasted in excess of one year at all sites, and as such water application treatments were performed in both the wet season and dry season.</p>
<p>Experimental plots were randomly located in the study sites; in Mogi-Guaçu and Uaimii they were organized in three replicate blocks. There was a minimum of 20 m between plots in blocks and 100 m between blocks. Randomly located plots were separated by a minimum of 50 m. The plots were spread across a maximum of 1,500 m in Peru and a minimum of 275 m in Ecuador. Experimental periods lasted between 1.4 and 2.8 years, depending on site (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbls2">Table S2</xref>), and all measurements of herbivory were conducted on leaves that were initiated during these periods. Cuttings were replaced if they died during the first three months of the experiment. One of the authors was present at all of the sites for multiple visits to ensure as much standardization of treatments as possible.</p>
<p>To determine the effects of site variation in natural levels of precipitation on the outcomes of the water treatments, the absolute level of precipitation and precipitation anomaly relative to climate normals was collected for each month of the experimental periods in Costa Rica, Ecuador, and Peru (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2</xref>). Climate data for Costa Rica were obtained from La Selva Biological Station. Data for Ecuador and Peru were obtained using TerraClimate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>), and an interpolation error in the precipitation for Peru in February 2016, was corrected using data from the National Service of Meteorology and Hydrology of Peru (SENAMHI).</p>

<title>Measures of herbivory and insect richness</title>
<p>Herbivory was recorded by taking photographs of all the experimental leaves at the end of the experimental period. Additional photos were taken every three months in Uaimii and Mogi-Guaçu, and in the first five months of the experiment in Costa Rica. These data were used to measure herbivory and to determine the types of herbivores feeding on leaves based on patterns of damage. When herbivores were observed on plants, they were photographed but were left to continue feeding so as to not interfere with the experiment. Herbivory was quantified by eye for each type of herbivore on each leaf by a single parataxonomist with extensive experience measuring herbivory on <italic>Piper</italic> following established protocols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>). The amount of leaf area consumed was measured in function to the total leaf area by visually dividing the leaf into equal sized segments to determine the percent area missing. This was measured as a continuous value to the greatest possible accuracy. Insect herbivores were identified to the lowest taxonomic level possible based on their damage patterns (genus for specialist Lepidoptera, family for other Lepidoptera, family for Coleoptera, order for Orthoptera). Direct observations of herbivores were rare, so only damage patterns were used in analyses. The different types of damage recorded were used as proxy for insect insect richness on <italic>Piper</italic>. Hereafter, the term “insect richness” refers to the richness of herbivore damage patterns on plants.</p>

<title>Data analyses</title>
<p>The percentage of leaf tissue consumed by each insect taxon (based on damage patterns) on individual leaves was summed to determine the total percentage of herbivory on each leaf, and the variance in herbivory was calculated as the variance in leaf damage within each plant in a plot. Due to high mortality rates across sites, <italic>Piper</italic> interspecific richness in each plot was the final number of <italic>Piper</italic> species present in each plot at the end of the experiment (rather than the number of species planted) and was analyzed as a continuous covariate rather than a categorical treatment. Because most plant deaths occurred early in the experiments, final <italic>Piper</italic> interspecific richness more accurately reflects the local plant richness experienced by herbivores. In order to compare the magnitude of effect of intra and interspecific diversity on predictor variables, interspecific diversity for each plot was analyzed as the proportion of the interspecific diversity present in the species pools at each site. The effect of intra and interspecific diversity on each response variable is reported as the change in response as diversity changes from the lowest possible value at each site to the highest.</p>
<p>The effects of intraspecific richness, interspecific richness, and water addition on percent leaf area consumed, the percentage of damaged leaves, variance in herbivory, and insect insect richness were analyzed across and within sites using hierarchical Bayesian models (HBM). This framework acts as the Bayesian equivalent of a random-effects model where site is a random effect, allowing for generalized parameter estimates across sites. Analyses testing <italic>Piper</italic> intraspecific richness and interspecific richness were conducted using data from all sites; the effects of water addition and its interactions with richness were conducted using data from Ecuador, Costa Rica, and Peru. Due to high mortality in Peru, interactions between the water addition and intraspecific richness treatments could not be modeled for measures of herbivory or insect richness and were only tested for survival.</p>
<p>We acknowledge that treatment level combinations were not the same across the different sites, but that is the nature of random-effects models, where different levels of random factors, such as site or year, consist of treatment levels that are unique to that site or year. In fact, this type of design goes back to the origins of mixed models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>), and are also a strength of the design, since lack of interactions between fixed and random effects increases generality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>). Even at a single site, manipulated variables in ecological experiments do not even consist of the same manipulations across all of the units of replication, as they suffer from problems such as multiple versions of treatments, interference, and noncompliance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>)</p>
<p>Bayesian structural equation models (BSEMs) were constructed for each site using all treatments as exogenous variables and insect richness and herbivory as endogenous variables. Three path models (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbls1">Table S1</xref>) were developed under the assumptions that 1) intraspecific and interspecific richness may influence herbivory both directly and indirectly by modulating insect richness 2) water addition may influence both herbivory and insect richness and 3) insect richness may influence herbivory directly (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbls1">Table S1</xref>). Models I, II, and III were tested in Ecuador, Costa Rica and Peru, while model III was used to analyze data from Mogi-Guaçu and Uaimii. Additional models incorporating interactions between intraspecific richness, interspecific richness, and water availability were tested in Costa Rica, Ecuador, and Peru.</p>
<p>Models were run at the leaf level for herbivory and insect richness, and at the plant level for the percentage of leaves with damage, variance of herbivory, and <italic>Piper</italic> survival. For all HBMs and BSEMs, model convergence was estimated visually using traceplots and an <sup>R^</sup> discriminatory threshold of 1.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>). Model fit was determined via posterior predictive checks (PPC) using the χ<sup>2</sup> discrepancy of the residuals as the discriminatory function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>). A PPC near 0.5 indicates a high model fit, while values near one or zero indicate poor fit. BSEM models were further compared using the Deviance Information Criterion (DIC).</p>
<p>All Bayesian models were written in JAGS via the jagsUI package in R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>) using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) samplers with weakly-informative priors. For the majority of models, MCMC runs were conducted for 10,000 iterations using the first 1,000 iterations as a burn-in phase to generate posterior distributions of parameter estimates for each response variable. HBMs modeling interactions required 20,000 iterations with the first 5,000 as burn-ins for all models to consistently converge. Mean parameter estimates and 95% credibility intervals (CIs) were calculated for all responses. 95% CIs which do not cross the y-axis are typically associated with less than a 2.5% type S error rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>). A posterior probability of direction (PD) was calculated based on the percentage of the posterior distribution responding in the same direction as the median response. A PD of 95%, for example, indicates that the same direction of response (e.g. a positive or negative response) was observed in 95% of iterations, regardless of the magnitude of the response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>). PDs less than 95%, indicate lower confidence that a relationship exists, but can still be interpreted as the probability that an effect exists.</p>
<p>To analyze the effects of the experimental treatments on plant survival, survivorship curves were constructed in all sites. Analyses of <italic>Piper</italic> survival were based on the initially planted interspecific richness treatment of each plot because mortality occurred early in the experiment. The effect of water addition, intra- and interspecific richness and species identity on <italic>Piper</italic> survival were analyzed using Cox proportional hazard models. All data were analyzed using R software v4.1.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>).</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Considerable variation in herbivory and plant mortality was observed among study sites. Percent herbivory was lowest at Mogi; only 9% of leaf tissue was consumed by herbivores compared to 22% of leaf tissue consumed in Uaimii. <italic>Piper</italic> mortality was highest in Peru (89%), likely due to an El Niño event, and was lowest in Ecuador (27%; <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3 A</xref>). <italic>Piper</italic> mortality resulted in the reduction of species richness in many plots and the loss of some combinations of treatments, notably the loss of all <italic>Piper</italic> in unwatered, low intraspecific richness plots in Peru (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1 B</xref>). Plots originally planted as high interspecific richness treatments had a final richness of between 1 and 12 species in Costa Rica, 9 and 11 species in Ecuador, 1 and 3 species in Peru, 2 and 4 species in Mogi, and only 2 species in Uaimii. We identified herbivore damage from 13 insect taxa at the five study sites, as well as damage by leaf miners of unknown orders. A total of 10 taxa were observed in Costa Rica, Ecuador, and Peru, 9 taxa were observed in Mogi, and 8 taxa were observed in Uaimii (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3 B</xref>). The majority of taxa in Costa Rica and Ecuador were <italic>Piper</italic> specialists, but the proportion of leaf tissue consumed by specialists was only greater than generalist damage in Costa Rica.</p>
<p>Our experiments revealed pronounced heterogeneity in ecosystem responses to changes in water and <italic>Piper</italic> diversity between sites (Figs. S4 &amp; S5). PPCs for all HBMs were within 0.03 of 0.5, indicating models fit well. Model II (Table S1) was selected as the most parsimonious causal model for BSEMs in Costa Rica (PPC = 0.499), Ecuador (PPC = 0.499), and Peru (PPC = 0.498). Fit was high for model III in Mogi (PPC = 0.5) and Uaimii (PPC = 0.497). When all sites were analyzed together, percent herbivory was 4.2±3.6% (mean ± 95% CI) lower in plots that received additional water (PD = 98.7%), but we did not detect a cross site effect of water on the percentage of leaves with damage (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A-B</xref>). We did not detect any direct cross-site effects of water addition, insect richness, or plant diversity on the variance in herbivory (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> C), or <italic>Piper</italic> survivorship (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> D). Notably, greater <italic>Piper</italic> interspecific richness was associated with a 15 ± 18.6% increase in the richness of insect herbivores when comparing high diversity plots to low diversity plots across sites (PD = 95.0%; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> E) and an indirect increase in herbivory was mediated by insect richness (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). Insect richness was associated with an 8.8±2.8% increase in herbivory per insect taxon present (PD = 100%) and a 6.7±6.9% increase in the percentage of leaves with any damage (PP = 97%) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> A, B). Changes in both intraspecific richness and interspecific richness altered these ecosystem processes considerably, although effects varied in strength and direction across sites (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbls4">Table S4</xref>). Although intraspecific richness was not quantified, the genetic origin of <italic>Piper</italic> plants (clones vs. independent propagules) affected herbivory, plant mortality, and insect richness with effect sizes of similar or even greater magnitude than interspecific richness when standardized as the proportion of available species richenss at each site. However, we found that intra- and interspecific richness often had contrasting directions of effect on insect richness and multiple measures of herbivore pressure (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figs. 3</xref>, S4 B-C &amp; S5 B-C). For example, in Costa Rica insect richness was 6.0 ± 5.9% (PD = 93.7%) lower in plots with high interspecific plant richness compared to low, while high intraspecific richness increased insect richness by 7.2 ± 6.9% (PD = 98.1%). In contrast, in Ecuador high interspecific richness was associated with a 43.6 ± 6.4% (PD = 100%) increase in insect richness, and high intraspecific richness decreased insect richness by 13.6 ± 5.2% (PD = 100%; <xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Fig. S5 B-C</xref>).</p>

<p>The effects of <italic>Piper</italic> richness were especially relevant when examining interactions between <italic>Piper</italic> richness and water addition (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). The effects of water addition were altered by <italic>Piper</italic> intra- and interspecific richness at all sites. While a reduction in herbivory driven by water availability was observed in Costa Rica (4.7±2.5%, PD = 100%) and Peru (5.1±3.7%, PD = 100%), this effect was only present in Ecuador when intraspecific richness was high (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Fig. S6</xref>). Across sites, water addition had negligible or negative effects on insect richness at low interspecific richness, but this effect was reduced or reversed when interspecific richness was high. Insect richness increased by 20.8±18.9% more in interspecifically diverse plots that received water compared to unwatered plots in Costa Rica (PD = 99%), 15.2±16.8% more in rich, watered plots in Ecuador (PD = 96%), and 29.3±31.5% more in Peru (PD = 98%) Additionally, Water addition had a negligible effect on insect richness in Ecuador when intraspecific richness was low, but increased insect richness by 12.1% when intraspecific richness was high (PD = 99%) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> B). Water addition had a negative effect on <italic>Piper</italic> survival in Costa Rica when intraspecific richness was low, but improved survival by 12.1 ± 8.5% in high intraspecific richness plots (PD = 99%; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> C). Interactions with water in Peru may have been influenced by an El Niño event which resulted in abnormally low rainfall and high <italic>Piper</italic> mortality, while the typically wetter sites in Costa Rica and Ecuador experienced greater precipitation than average (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2</xref>). As there was 100% mortality in low intraspecific richness, unwatered plots in Peru, we could not explore interactions between intraspecific richness and water for any response except <italic>Piper</italic> mortality in this site.</p>

<p>Water addition did not affect <italic>Piper</italic> survival in Costa Rica (z = -1.2, <italic>P</italic> &gt; 0.2), or in Ecuador (z = 0.2, <italic>P</italic> &gt; 0.8), but survival was reduced by 48% in plots without water in Peru (z = 3.2, <italic>P</italic> = 0.001). Intraspecific richness increased survival by 38% in Costa Rica (z = -3.3, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001) and by 32% in Ecuador (z = -4.9, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001), but had no effect on survival in Peru (z = - 1.55, <italic>P</italic> &gt; 0.1), Mogi (z = -0.22, P &gt; 0.8), or Uaimii (z = 0.18, <italic>P</italic> &gt; 0.8). Interspecific richness had no effect on survival in Costa Rica (z = -1.5, <italic>P</italic> &gt; 0.1), Ecuador (z = -0.56, <italic>P</italic> &gt; 0.5), Peru (z = - 0.49, <italic>P</italic> &gt; 0.6), or Uaimii (z = 0.21, <italic>P</italic> &gt; 0.8). In Mogi, survival was reduced by 13% in plots with higher interspecific richness (z = -2.16, <italic>P</italic> = 0.031). There was an interaction between intraspecific richness and water addition in Costa Rica and Peru. Survival in Costa Rica increased in response to water in high intraspecific richness plots, and decreased in response to water in low intraspecific richness plots (z = 3.8, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001), while the opposite pattern was observed in Peru (z = -2.4, <italic>P</italic> = 0.02; <xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Fig. S7</xref>). Although plant die-offs caused plot level species extirpation at several sites, plant species identity was not related to survival rates with the exception of <italic>P. peltatum</italic>, which had the lowest survival rate of any species planted in Costa Rica.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our results demonstrate two key patterns. First, the strength of effects of intraspecific richness on higher trophic levels is comparable to that of interspecific richness, supporting our predictions and corroborating recent studies demonstrating the importance of intraspecific richness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>). However, the effects of intra- and interspecific richness on herbivory, insect richness, and plant survival can differ dramatically, in contrast to our predictions. Second, we found that perturbations in water availability can have complex effects on herbivores and plant survival, and that these effects can be modulated by plant diversity in a context sensitive manner. While our prediction that water availability would influence herbivory across sites was supported, our results suggest that biodiversity loss and climatic perturbations may have dramatically different effects on ecosystem function at local scales, which may diminish our ability to predict how local communities will change as anthropogenic stressors increase.</p>
<p>Although experimental methods varied somewhat between study sites, we do not believe this can fully explain the level of heterogeneity observed in ecosystem response. For example, the methods employed in Costa Rica and Ecuador were nearly identical, and yet the directions of effect of intra and interspecific diversity on insect richness were reversed in these sites (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Fig. S5 B-C</xref>). The only meaningful differences between these two sites were the climate and the composition of the local <italic>Piper</italic> and insect communities. There was considerable variation in both biotic (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3 B</xref>) and abiotic factors (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbls2">Table S2</xref>) across sites, which may have contributed to the heterogeneity observed in ecosystem response to <italic>Piper</italic> diversity.</p>
<p>As we did not directly measure plant stress or nutrition, it is difficult to determine the exact mechanism through which water addition reduced herbivory. The presence of an El Niño weather pattern during the course of the Peru experiment may have led the water addition treatment to relieve plants from drought stress, while water addition in Costa Rica and Ecuador may have added to water stress in treated plants as these sites received an above average level of rainfall during the course of the experiment. Despite this, water addition consistently suppressed herbivory in Costa Rica, Ecuador, and Peru under natural levels of <italic>Piper</italic> diversity, suggesting that predicted increases in precipitation in the next century (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>) will dramatically alter the flow of resources from primary producers. Although we were only able to record the richness of insect herbivory patterns, this measure is indicative of the functional diversity of insect herbivores on <italic>Piper</italic> and any changes to this value represent changes in interactions between <italic>Piper</italic> and higher trophic levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>). As such, the additional reduction in effects of water addition on insect richness when <italic>Piper</italic> richness was low suggest that biodiversity loss in tropical systems will alter the ability of higher trophic levels to respond to environmental perturbations.</p>
<p>As herbivore taxa can be differently affected by manipulations of diversity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>), variation in the direction of the effect of intra- and interspecific richness may be due in part to variation in the composition of insect communities and herbivore pressure measured across sites. Changes in neighborhood effects when small numbers of plant species dominate a community can lead either to the reduction or increase of herbivore pressure, dependent both on the nature of plant species lost and herbivore species present in a given community (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>). As such, local variation in community composition has the potential to greatly alter the effects of both climate change and biodiversity loss on ecosystem function. Regardless of how biodiversity loss effects ecosystem function at large scales, variation in abiotic and biotic factors at locals scales can alter these effects, reducing our ability to predict how anthropogenic activity will alter ecosystem function. This is especially relevant in tropical systems, which have been the subject of far fewer studies of ecosystem function. As such, our knowledge of local scale effects on the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem function remains limited in these systems.</p>
<p>A long-standing question in ecology has been the extent to which ecosystem function increases with biodiversity and if this relationship plateaus at a level past which ecological redundancy predominates. Recent results from less complex temperate grassland systems suggest that these ecosystems can be described by a mostly linear relationship between richness and function, where even rare species contribute uniquely to ecosystem function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>). In these systems, high contingency can be expected, where ecosystem-level effects will depend on most of the interacting species. In contrast, we might expect that diverse, tropical communities could be characterized by greater ecological redundancy and thus be subject to less contingency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>). Despite these expectations, our results demonstrate heterogeneity in ecosystem response to changes in both intraspecific and interspecific richness in five tropical sites, suggesting that complexity in these systems may not reduce the contingency effects of biodiversity loss. Understanding the impact of biodiversity loss in tropical forests is fundamental to our ability to conserve those systems, and our findings highlight the importance of approaching the study of changes in ecosystem function as context sensitive responses in complex ecosystems.</p>

<p>This <bold>valuable</bold> study presents a large experimental study to examine the effects of plant species richness, plant genotypic richness, and soil water availability on herbivory patterns on Piper species in several tropical sites. The authors find that water availability and both intra- and interspecific plant diversity influence herbivory and herbivore diversity, but that the effects differ in significant ways across sites. The major weakness lies in findings that can be better presented in a less complicated fashion. The major claims are currently supported by a combination of <bold>solid</bold> and <bold>incomplete</bold> evidence, and the manuscript would benefit from better organization.</p>

<p>This study reports a long-term, multisite study of tropical herbivory on Piper plants. The results are clear that lack of water leads to lower plant survival and altered herbivory. The results varied substantially among sites. The caveats are that ecosystem processes beyond water availability are not investigated although they are brought into play in the title and in the paper, that herbivory beyond leaf damage was not reported (there might be none, the reader needs to be shown the evidence for this), that herbivore diversity is defined by leaf damage (authors need to give evidence that this is a valid inference), that the plots were isolated from herbivores beyond their borders, that the effects of extreme climate events were isolated to Peru, that intraspecific variation in the host plants needs to be explained and interpreted in more detail, the results as reported are extremely complicated, the discussion is overly long and diffuse.</p>

<p>This is an important and large experimental study examining the effects of plant species richness, plant genotypic richness, and soil water availability on herbivory patterns on Piper species in tropical forests.</p>
<p>A major strength is the size of the study and the fact that it tackled so many potentially important factors simultaneously. The authors examined both interspecific plant diversity and intraspecific plant diversity. They crossed that with a water availability treatment. And they repeated the experiment across five geographically separated sites.</p>
<p>The authors find that both water availability and plant diversity, intraspecific and interspecific, influence herbivore diversity and herbivory, but that the effects differ in important ways across sites. I found the study to be solid and the results to be very convincing. The results will help the field grapple with the importance of environmental change and biodiversity loss and how they structure communities and alter species interactions.</p>
