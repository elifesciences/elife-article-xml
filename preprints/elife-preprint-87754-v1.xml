<title>Abstract</title>
<p>The vasopressin type 2 receptor (V<sub>2</sub>R) is an essential GPCR in renal regulation of water homeostasis. Upon stimulation, the V<sub>2</sub>R activates Gα<sub>s</sub> and Gα<sub>q/11</sub>, which is followed by robust recruitment of β-arrestins and receptor internalization into endosomes. Unlike canonical GPCR signaling, the β-arrestin association with the V<sub>2</sub>R does not terminate Gα<sub>s</sub> activation, and thus, Gα<sub>s</sub>-mediated signaling is sustained while the receptor is internalized. Here, we demonstrate that this V<sub>2</sub>R ability to co-interact with G protein/β-arrestin and promote endosomal G protein signaling is not restricted to Gα<sub>s</sub>, but also involves Gα<sub>q/11</sub>. Furthermore, our data implies that β-arrestins potentiate Gα<sub>s</sub>/Gα<sub>q/11</sub> activation at endosomes rather than terminating their signaling. Surprisingly, we found that the V<sub>2</sub>R internalizes and promote endosomal G protein activation independent of β-arrestins to a minor degree. These new observations challenge the current model of endosomal GPCR signaling and suggest that this event can occur in both β-arrestin-dependent and -independent manners.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The vasopressin type 2 receptor (V<sub>2</sub>R) is mainly known for its antidiuretic action in the kidney. Here, in the principal cells of the collecting duct, the V<sub>2</sub>R regulates water reabsorption from pre-urine by promoting translocation of water channel aquaporin 2 (AQP2) located in intracellular vesicles to the apical membrane<sup><xref rid="c1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>. The net result of this translocation is an enhanced water permeability. Defective V<sub>2</sub>R signaling due to loss or gain of function mutations is associated to nephrogenic diabetes insipidus<sup><xref rid="c2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> or nephrogenic syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis<sup><xref rid="c3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>, respectively.</p>
<p>The V<sub>2</sub>R belongs to the superfamily of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), membrane proteins that control almost all physiological processes. Canonically, stimulation of GPCRs leads to coupling and activation of heterotrimeric G proteins (Gαβγ), which initiate downstream signaling cascades. GPCRs can couple to four families of Gα protein isoforms: Gα<sub>s/olf</sub>, Gα<sub>i/o</sub>, Gα<sub>q/11</sub>, and Gα<sub>12/13</sub>. Activation of each family leads to distinct downstream signaling events and cell biological outcomes. G protein activation is short lived and followed by receptor phosphorylation by GPCR kinases, which drives the recruitment of β-arrestins (βarrs) to the phosphorylated receptor. As βarrs interact with the same region of the receptor as G proteins, their recruitment physically uncouples G proteins from the receptor which causes desensitization of G protein signaling<sup><xref rid="c4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>. In addition, βarrs scaffold several proteins involved in endocytosis, which promotes receptor internalization into endosomes<sup><xref rid="c5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="c6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, recent findings facilitated by the emergence of new molecular tools to interrogate signaling events with a subcellular resolution have challenged this plasma membrane centric view of G protein signaling. Several GPCRs, including the V<sub>2</sub>R, have been reported to engage in G protein signaling after receptor internalization into early endosomes and/or other intracellular compartments<sup><xref rid="c7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="c8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>. Interestingly, endosomal Gα<sub>s</sub> signaling by V<sub>2</sub>R was demonstrated to enhance sustained translocation of AQP2 to the plasma membrane to facilitate water reabsorption<sup><xref rid="c7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>. This endosomal stimulation of G protein signaling by βarr-bound GPCRs has been difficult to reconcile with the aforementioned canonical understanding of GPCR signaling since G protein and βarr interactions with GPCRs were thought to be mutually exclusive. However, we discovered and delineated a new signaling paradigm whereby some GPCRs, including the V<sub>2</sub>R, bind βarrs in a specific manner; in this conformation, βarr only interacts with the receptor carboxy-terminal tail thereby permitting the receptor transmembrane core to bind with G proteins simultaneously to form a “megaplex”<sup><xref rid="c8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>. Due to the simultaneous engagement with G protein and βarr, the receptor in these megaplexes maintains its ability to activate G protein, even while being internalized by βarrs.</p>
<p>Although known as a Gα<sub>s</sub>-coupled receptor, several studies report activation of the Gα<sub>q/11</sub> isoforms by V<sub>2</sub>R<sup><xref rid="c11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>-<xref rid="c15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> as well as unproductive coupling to Gα<sub>12</sub><sup><xref rid="c14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>. Therefore, we hypothesized that the V<sub>2</sub>R form megaplexes with both Gα<sub>s</sub> and Gα<sub>q</sub> leading to endosomal activation of both Gα<sub>s</sub> and Gα<sub>q</sub>. In addition, pulse-stimulation experiments of the V<sub>2</sub>R and parathyroid hormone type 1 receptor (PTHR) demonstrated that sustained Gα<sub>s</sub>-mediated signaling was enhanced by βarr<sup><xref rid="c7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="c16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>. To address whether such βarr-mediated increase in G protein signaling is a result of direct coupling and activation of G proteins at endosomes, we here applied a combination of approaches based on engineered mini G proteins (mG proteins)<sup><xref rid="c17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="c18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup>, enhanced bystander bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (EbBRET)<sup><xref rid="c19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>, nanoluciferase binary technology (NanoBiT)<sup><xref rid="c20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>, and confocal microscopy imaging.</p>

<title>The V<sub>2</sub>R activates Gα<sub>s</sub> and Gα<sub>q</sub> from early endosomes</title>
<p>To measure the activation of the four families of G protein isoforms at the plasma membrane and early endosomes by the V<sub>2</sub>R in real-time, we used mG proteins. The mG proteins are homogenously distributed in the cytosol under basal condition but translocate to the subcellular location of GPCRs upon stimulation<sup><xref rid="c17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="c18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="c21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>. In addition, we applied an EbBRET approach instead of a conventional bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET)-based assay to monitor mG protein trafficking. EbBRET displays superior robustness and sensitivity, as well as higher dynamic spectrometric energy transfer signals associated to EbBRET as compared to conventional BRET, which is why this approach was favored<sup><xref rid="c19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>. We fused mG proteins to the luciferase from <italic>Renilla reniformis</italic> (Rluc) and anchored green fluorescent protein from the same species (rGFP) to polybasic sequence and prenylation CAAX box of KRas (rGFP-CAAX), which is located at the plasma membrane<sup><xref rid="c22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup>, or to the early endosome marker Rab5<sup><xref rid="c23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a,b</xref>, left panels). Four variants of mG proteins (mGs, mGsi, mGsq, and mG12) have been designed and shown to maintain the receptor-Gα protein specificity of the four Gα subunit isoform families<sup><xref rid="c18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup>. In HEK293 cells expressing rGFP-CAAX, V<sub>2</sub>R, and similar levels of Rluc-fused mG proteins (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 1a</xref>), arginine vasopressin (AVP) treatment induced a rapid recruitment of mGs and mGsq but not mGsi nor mG12 to the plasma membrane. Maximal recruitment of the mGs and mGsq were reached ∼10 minutes after initial stimulation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>, right panel). These results suggest that the V<sub>2</sub>R activates both Gα<sub>s</sub> and Gα<sub>q</sub> at the plasma membrane. In addition, AVP stimulation led to the recruitment of the same mG protein isoforms to early endosomes in cells expressing rGFP-Rab5, V<sub>2</sub>R, and similar levels of Rluc-fused mG proteins (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>, right panel and <xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 1b</xref>). In contrast to the plasma membrane response, mGs and mGsq recruitment to early endosomes were slower and reached maximal levels 45-60 minutes after initial stimulation with AVP (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>, right panel).</p>

<p>To visualize V<sub>2</sub>R-mediated activation of Gα<sub>s</sub> and Gα<sub>q</sub> at the plasma membrane and early endosomes we used confocal microscopy. For this purpose, we transfected HEK293 cells with mGs or mGsq fused to a HaloTag (Halo-mGs and Halo-mGsq) along with the respective red fluorescent protein (RFP)-fused plasma membrane or early endosomes markers Lck<sup><xref rid="c24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> or early endosome antigen 1 (EEA1)<sup><xref rid="c25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup>. Upon HaloTag labelling with a fluorescent green ligand, mGs and mGsq were visible and homogenously distributed in the cytosol under basal condition (vehicle) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>). In contrast, in cells treated with AVP for 10 minutes, both mGs and mGsq were redistributed along the periphery of the cells where they colocalized with RFP-Lck (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c,d</xref>). These observations confirm that Gα<sub>s</sub> and Gα<sub>q</sub> are activated by the V<sub>2</sub>R at the plasma membrane. In cells expressing the early endosomal marker RFP-EEA1, robust colocalization between the Halo-mG proteins and RFP-EEA1 were found 45 min after initial AVP-stimulation but not by vehicle treatment (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1e,f</xref>). Together our EbBRET and confocal microscopy imaging data suggest that Gα<sub>s</sub> and Gα<sub>q</sub> are activated by V<sub>2</sub>R first at plasma membrane, and later on, from early endosomes after the V<sub>2</sub>R has been internalized.</p>

<title>The V<sub>2</sub>R recruits Gα<sub>s</sub>/Gα<sub>q</sub> and βarrs simultaneously</title>
<p>G protein activation from endosomes by some GPCRs is associated with the ability of the receptor to recruit G protein and βarr simultaneously to form a GPCR-βarr-G protein megaplex. As we already previously demonstrated that the V<sub>2</sub>R forms V<sub>2</sub>R-βarr-G<sub>s</sub> megaplexes upon AVP stimulation<sup><xref rid="c8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>, we here explored whether formation of such complexes potentially can be formed with G<sub>q/11</sub> as well. In addition to the V<sub>2</sub>R, we also applied a chimeric V<sub>2</sub>R harboring the carboxy-terminal tail of the β<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic receptor (β<sub>2</sub>AR) referred to as V<sub>2</sub>β<sub>2</sub>AR. We previously showed that the phosphorylated V<sub>2</sub>R carboxy-tail forms stable complexes with βarr, a requirement of megaplex formation, whereas the carboxy-tail of the β<sub>2</sub>AR does not<sup><xref rid="c10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>. Therefore, we expected that only the V<sub>2</sub>R, but not the V<sub>2</sub>β<sub>2</sub>AR, recruits G proteins and βarrs simultaneously upon agonist challenge.</p>
<p>Both the V<sub>2</sub>R and V<sub>2</sub>β<sub>2</sub>AR bind to AVP with similar affinities and activate adenylyl cyclase via Gα<sub>s</sub> with similar potencies<sup><xref rid="c26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup>. We monitored activation of the four Gα protein families at the plasma membrane by the V<sub>2</sub>β<sub>2</sub>AR upon AVP treatment using the same approach utilized in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>. Similarly to the V<sub>2</sub>R, the V<sub>2</sub>β<sub>2</sub>AR activated both Gα<sub>s</sub> and Gα<sub>q</sub>, but not Gα<sub>i</sub> or Gα<sub>12</sub>, at plasma membrane with a maximal response reached after ∼10 minutes of stimulation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>, and <xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>). While the V<sub>2</sub>R and V<sub>2</sub>β<sub>2</sub>AR are both reported to internalize via a βarr-dependent mechanism, βarr has been reported to rapidly dissociate from the V<sub>2</sub>β<sub>2</sub>AR shortly after its recruitment to the plasma membrane due to its low affinity for this receptor chimera<sup><xref rid="c26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup>. In contrast, βarr stays associated with the V<sub>2</sub>R during its internalization into endosomes owning to its high affinity for the V<sub>2</sub>R<sup><xref rid="c26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup>. Here, we compared the kinetics of βarr1 and βarr2 recruitment to the V<sub>2</sub>R and V<sub>2</sub>β<sub>2</sub>AR at the plasma membrane and early endosomes by monitoring AVP-promoted EbBRET between Rluc-fused βarrs and rGFP-CAAX or rGFP-Rab5, respectively (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref>, left panel). At similar levels of receptor and βarr expressions (<xref rid="figS3" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 3a</xref>), both receptors recruited βarr1 and βarr2 at plasma membrane maximally after 10 minutes of stimulation with AVP (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref>, right upper panel). However, the presence of βarrs at the plasma membrane declined rapidly hereafter 10 minutes in V<sub>2</sub>R-expressing cells, while remaining for longer periods of time in V<sub>2</sub>β<sub>2</sub>AR-expressing cells. These findings are in line with the previous reported observations<sup><xref rid="c26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup>. Additionally, the translocation of βarrs to the plasma membrane was more robust for the V<sub>2</sub>R as compared to the V<sub>2</sub>β<sub>2</sub>AR, which is reminiscent from the higher affinity of βarrs for the V<sub>2</sub>R as compared to the β<sub>2</sub>AR<sup><xref rid="c27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup>. In contrast to the rapid translocation of βarrs to the plasma membrane, AVP treatment induced a robust but slower recruitment of βarrs to early endosomes with V<sub>2</sub>R reaching a maximal response after approximately 45 minutes of stimulation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref>, right bottom panel). Importantly, as opposed to V<sub>2</sub>R, AVP-stimulation of V<sub>2</sub>β<sub>2</sub>AR did not result in βarr translocation to early endosomes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref>, right bottom panel, and <xref rid="figS3" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 3b</xref>). Consequently, the V<sub>2</sub>β<sub>2</sub>AR represents a valuable negative control to investigate the ability to recruit G proteins and βarrs simultaneously at endosomes.</p>

<p>To track the simultaneous coupling of G proteins and βarrs to GPCRs in real-time, a nanoBiT approach was used. Both mGs and mGsq were fused to the large portion of nanoluciferase (large-BiT; LgBiT) and βarr1 to an optimized small peptide BiT (small BiT; SmBiT). Reconstitution of the complete and functional nanoluciferase, which catalyzes the conversion of coelenterazine h, results in emission of a bright luminescence signal. In our setup, close proximity of LgBiT and SmBiT only occurs when LgBiT-mG and SmBiT-βarr1 are recruited simultaneously to the receptor, which is a hall mark of megaplex formation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref>, left panel). Using this approach, we detected bright luminescence signals involving mGs/βarr1 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref>, upper right panel) and mGsq/βarr1 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref>, bottom right panel) upon stimulation of the V<sub>2</sub>R but not the V<sub>2</sub>β<sub>2</sub>AR. Interestingly, the dual coupling of Gα<sub>q</sub>/βarr to V<sub>2</sub>R appeared to be faster than the co-coupling of Gα<sub>s</sub>/βarr. While 20 minutes was required to reach the maximal response of V<sub>2</sub>R-stimulated mGs/βarr1 co-coupling, 8 minutes was sufficient to obtain the maximal levels of mGsq/βarr1 recruitment to the V<sub>2</sub>R (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref>, right panels).</p>
<p>To visualize the simultaneous recruitment of G proteins and βarr by confocal microscopy, we transfected HEK293 cells with βarr2 fused to RFP (RFP-βarr2), Halo-mGs or Halo-mGsq, and the V<sub>2</sub>R or V<sub>2</sub>β<sub>2</sub>AR. In vehicle-treated cells, both mGs and βarr2 were homogenously distributed in the cytosol (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d</xref>). However, after prolonged stimulation of V<sub>2</sub>R with AVP, around 75% of βarr2 colocalized with mGs in endocytic vesicles (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d,f</xref>). In V<sub>2</sub>β<sub>2</sub>AR-stimulated cells, little to no colocalization was observed between βarr2 and mGs upon prolonged stimulation with AVP (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d, f</xref>). Surprisingly, however, some clusters of intracellular mGs were clearly visible (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d, f</xref>). These results suggest simultaneous coupling of Gα<sub>s</sub>/βarr2 to the V<sub>2</sub>R in endosomes but not to the V<sub>2</sub>β<sub>2</sub>AR. In cells expressing mGsq, both mGsq and βarr2 were also homogenously distributed in the cytosol when cells were treated with the vehicle in a similar fashion to cells expressing mGs (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2e</xref>). Upon AVP stimulation, approximately 75% of βarr2 colocalized with mGsq in intracellular vesicles in V<sub>2</sub>R-expressing cells, whereas poor colocalization was observed in V<sub>2</sub>β<sub>2</sub>AR-expressing cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2e,f</xref>). However, similarly to cells expressing mGs, some clusters of intracellular mGsq were visible in cells expressing V<sub>2</sub>β<sub>2</sub>AR, suggesting a certain level of endosomal Gα<sub>s</sub>/Gα<sub>q</sub> signaling despite the absence of βarr2.</p>

<title>βarr-dependent and -independent endosomal G protein activation by the V<sub>2</sub>R</title>
<p>Activation of Gα<sub>s</sub> and Gα<sub>q</sub> by the V<sub>2</sub>β<sub>2</sub>AR from endosome-like structures in the absence of local βarr raises the possibility that the V<sub>2</sub>R can activate these G proteins from endosomes in both βarr-dependent and -independent manners. To test this hypothesis, we compared AVP-induced Gα<sub>s</sub> and Gα<sub>q</sub> activation at plasma membrane and endosomes in CRISPR/Cas9-engineered βarr1- and βarr2-deficient HEK293 cells (ββarr1/2)<sup><xref rid="c19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> as well as their parental cellular counterpart. The surface expression of V<sub>2</sub>R was matched in both cellular backgrounds (<xref rid="figS4" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 4a,b</xref>). Using the EbBRET biosensors described in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a-b</xref>, we performed AVP concentration-response characterization of Gα<sub>s</sub> and Gα<sub>q</sub> activation at the plasma membrane (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>) and early endosomes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref>) in parental and ββarr1/2 HEK293 cells. In contrast to Gα<sub>s</sub> and Gα<sub>q</sub> activation at the plasma membrane, which were not negatively affected by the absence of βarrs (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>), we observed a robust decrease in the ability of the V<sub>2</sub>R to activate Gα<sub>s</sub> and Gα<sub>q</sub> at endosomes in ββarr1/2 cells as compared to their parental counterpart (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref> and <xref rid="tblS1" ref-type="table">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). These data demonstrate the important role of βarrs in endosomal Gα<sub>s</sub>/Gα<sub>q/11</sub> activation by the V<sub>2</sub>R. However, although the ββarr1/2 cells do not express βarrs, we still observed significant residual G protein activation from endosomes. This surprising observation suggests that the V<sub>2</sub>R internalizes into endosomes to some extent in a βarr-independent manner from where G proteins are stimulated. To probe this possibility, we compared V<sub>2</sub>R internalization in parental and ββarr1/2 HEK293 cells expressing rGFP-CAAX and equivalent amounts of V<sub>2</sub>R fused to Rluc at its carboxy-terminal tail (V<sub>2</sub>R-Rluc) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3c</xref>, left panel and <xref rid="figS4" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 4c</xref>). In parental HEK293 cells, AVP-stimulation of the V<sub>2</sub>R-Rluc led to a robust decrease of EbBRET values, which indicates strong receptor internalization (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3c</xref>, right panel). Interestingly, we also observed significant internalization of the V<sub>2</sub>R in ββarr1/2 HEK293 cells, although less than in the parental cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3c</xref>, right panel). These results suggest that a minor population of V<sub>2</sub>R internalizes independently of βarrs and contributes to endosomal Gα<sub>s</sub> and Gα<sub>q/11</sub> signaling.</p>

<title>βarrs potentiate endosomal Gα<sub>s</sub> and Gα<sub>q</sub> activation by the V<sub>2</sub>R</title>
<p>Although our data suggest that a minor population of V<sub>2</sub>R internalizes in the absence of βarrs and contribute to V<sub>2</sub>R-mediated endosomal Gα<sub>s</sub> signaling, it has been reported that βarr binding to the V<sub>2</sub>R and parathyroid hormone receptor (PTHR) potentiates endosomal Gα<sub>s</sub> signaling<sup><xref rid="c7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="c16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>. To verify this and determine if this potentiator effect of βarrs also affects endosomal Gα<sub>q/11</sub> signaling, we compared endosomal Gα<sub>s</sub> and Gα<sub>q/11</sub> activation in cells expressing similar levels of V<sub>2</sub>R or V<sub>2</sub>β<sub>2</sub>AR (<xref rid="figS4" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 4d,e</xref>). Our rationale for using these two receptors is that if βarrs potentiate endosomal G protein activation, this potentiator effect will be observed to a greater extent for the V<sub>2</sub>R since this receptor associates more robustly with βarrs as compared to the V<sub>2</sub>β<sub>2</sub>AR. Using the same biosensors as in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a-b</xref>, we performed AVP dose-response curves of mGs and mGsq recruitment to the plasma membrane and early endosomes (<xref rid="figS5" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 5</xref>, and <xref rid="tblS2" ref-type="table">Supplementary Table 2</xref>). From the dose-response curves obtained (<xref rid="figS5" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 5</xref>, and <xref rid="tblS2" ref-type="table">Supplementary Table 2</xref>), we determined the transduction coefficient log(τ/Ka), a parameter that combines efficiency and potency to determine the overall G protein transduction, for each condition using the operational model of Kenakin and Christopoulos<sup><xref rid="c28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup>. In cells expressing mGs, the transduction coefficients of Gα<sub>s</sub> activation at the plasma membrane were similar for the V<sub>2</sub>R and V<sub>2</sub>β<sub>2</sub>AR, but higher for the V<sub>2</sub>R than V<sub>2</sub>β<sub>2</sub>AR in early endosomes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3d</xref> and <xref rid="tblS2" ref-type="table">Supplementary Table 2</xref>). Similarly, in cells expressing mGsq, the transduction coefficients of Gα<sub>q/11</sub> activation at the plasma membrane were similar for the V<sub>2</sub>R and V<sub>2</sub>β<sub>2</sub>AR, but higher for the V<sub>2</sub>R than V<sub>2</sub>β<sub>2</sub>AR in early endosomes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3e</xref> and <xref rid="tblS2" ref-type="table">Supplementary Table 2</xref>). Altogether these results indicate that βarrs potentiate activation of G proteins by the V<sub>2</sub>R in early endosomes.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In the present work, we addressed the spatial aspect of G protein signaling by the V<sub>2</sub>R and investigated the potential role of βarrs in modulating these responses. Several studies report activation of Gα<sub>s</sub> and Gα<sub>q/11</sub> by the V<sub>2</sub>R using a wide range of assays<sup><xref rid="c11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>-<xref rid="c15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>. However, these assays lack spatial resolution or are measured by default at the plasma membrane. Here, we demonstrated that both Gα<sub>s</sub> and Gα<sub>q/11</sub> are activated by the V<sub>2</sub>R at the plasma membrane as well as early endosomes using a mG proteins-based approach. The PTHR, a GPCR that regulates mineral ion homeostasis and bone development, also couples to both Gα<sub>s</sub> and Gα<sub>q/11</sub><sup><xref rid="c29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup>. Similar to our observations of the V<sub>2</sub>R, the reduction of PTHR internalization by βarr1 and βarr2 depletion strongly decreases endosomal Gα<sub>s</sub>/cAMP signaling. However, in contrast to the V<sub>2</sub>R, βarr-mediated receptor internalization shuts down Gα<sub>q/11</sub>-mediated responses, and thus, the PTHR does not appear to stimulate Gα<sub>q/11</sub> from endosomes<sup><xref rid="c16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="c30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>The reason for this inability of internalized PTHR to activate Gα<sub>q/11</sub> from endosomes is not known. However, it is unlikely to be a general feature of these G protein isoforms as multiple laboratories have reported endosomal GPCR signaling events downstream of Gα<sub>q/11</sub> activation. These events include measurements of signal-amplified responses such as protein kinase C (PKC) recruitment or ERK1/2 activation<sup><xref rid="c31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>-<xref rid="c33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup>. Recently, direct activation of Gα<sub>q/11</sub> from early endosomes was monitored using a mG protein-based approach and effector membrane translocation assay (EMTA)<sup><xref rid="c34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup>. In this study, Wright <italic>et al</italic>. demonstrated that stimulation of Gα<sub>q/11</sub> protein isoforms by receptors at the plasma membrane does not necessarily lead to the activation of the exact same isoforms at endosomes. For example, the authors showed that the thromboxane A<sub>2</sub> alpha isoform receptor (TPαR) robustly activates all the Gα<sub>q/11</sub> isoforms (Gα<sub>q</sub>, Gα<sub>11</sub>, Gα<sub>14</sub>, and Gα<sub>15</sub>) at the plasma membrane, but only activates Gα<sub>q</sub> and Gα<sub>11</sub> isoforms at endosomes. In contrast, the muscarinic acetylcholine M<sub>3</sub> receptor (M<sub>3</sub>R) activates all four Gα<sub>q/11</sub> isoforms both at plasma membrane and endosomes. While G protein selectivity at plasma membrane is mainly dependent on receptor conformation<sup><xref rid="c35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="c36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup>, specific residues present at the GPCR-Gα protein interface<sup><xref rid="c37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup>, as well as the location and duration of these intermolecular interactions<sup><xref rid="c38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup>, endosomal G protein activation seems to be controlled by additional factors that are not fully understood.</p>
<p>The presence of serine/threonine phosphorylation site clusters at the carboxy-terminal tail of GPCRs delineates two major classes of receptors; class A and class B<sup><xref rid="c27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup>. Class A GPCRs such as the β<sub>2</sub>AR are defined by harboring few single phosphorylation sites, which form interactions with positively charged residues of βarrs. In addition to the phosphorylated receptor residues, the class A GPCR– βarr association also depends on an interaction between the βarr fingerloop region and the receptor transmembrane core, which sterically block G protein access to the GPCR<sup><xref rid="c10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="c39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup>. The class A GPCR– βarr association is transient and the complex dissociates shortly after endocytosis, which results in receptor recycling back to the cell surface. In contrast, class B GPCRs including the V<sub>2</sub>R are defined by having phosphorylation site clusters in the carboxy-terminal tail that form highly stable associations with βarrs solely through this region. This strong interaction leads to prolonged receptor internalization into endosomes<sup><xref rid="c10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>. As the stability of this GPCR–βarr complex ‘tail’ conformation does not depend on the interaction between the βarr fingerloop region and the receptor core, the GPCR can internalize via βarrs into different intracellular compartments while stimulating G protein signaling for prolonged periods of time<sup><xref rid="c7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="c8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="c10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="c40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="c41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup>. Previously, formation of such GPCR–G protein–βarr megaplexes at intracellular compartments has only been reported with Gα<sub>s</sub> or Gα<sub>i/o</sub> proteins<sup><xref rid="c8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="c42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,<xref rid="c43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref></sup>. In the present study we demonstrate that megaplex formation is not confined to these G protein isoforms but also appears to form with other G protein isoforms such as Gα<sub>q/11</sub>.</p>
<p>An interesting aspect of βarr/megaplex-dependent endosomal G protein signaling is whether βarrs only acts a vehicle that transports GPCRs to this subcellular location from where they activate G proteins or whether βarrs in megaplexes themselves directly modulate G protein activity. In the current study, we show that βarrs directly potentiate G protein activation by the V<sub>2</sub>R in early endosomes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). These findings are further supported by Feinstein <italic>et al</italic>. who previously demonstrated that V<sub>2</sub>R-stimulated G protein activation is positively modulated by the presence of βarr2<sup><xref rid="c7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>. However, in the recent cryo-electron microscopy high-resolution structure of an engineered class B GPCR–Gs–βarr1 megaplex, no direct interaction between the heterotrimeric Gs and βarr1 was observed, and thus, it is not obvious how βarrs may affect G protein activity from this structure<sup><xref rid="c9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>. On the other hand, biochemical studies of the megaplex and G protein–βarrs interactions demonstrated that βarr can serve as a scaffold for the Gβγ subunits that are released upon activation of the heterotrimeric G protein<sup><xref rid="c8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="c44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,<xref rid="c45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref></sup>. Thus, this Gβγ scaffolding role of βarr may confine Gα<sub>s</sub> and Gα<sub>q/11</sub> near endosomally-located V<sub>2</sub>R, leading to their re-activation as soon as the inactive GDP-bound Gα with Gβγ subunits reassemble. The results of such activation mechanism would be a net increase in the G protein activation rate.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, our results using ββarr1/2 cells indicate that the V<sub>2</sub>R not only promote endosomal G protein signaling in a βarr/megaplex-dependent manner but also can internalize and activate G proteins from endosomes in a βarr-independent fashion (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a,b</xref>). Although our data showed that βarr-independent endosomal G protein activation is substantial less effective than the βarr-dependent mechanism for the V<sub>2</sub>R, it still represents an alternative mode of endosomal GPCR signaling that little is known about. Interestingly, in a very recent study of the vasoactive intestinal peptide receptor 1 (VIPR1) by Blythe &amp; von Zastrow, it was shown that VIPR1 promotes robust G protein signaling from endosomes and that this occurs in a completely βarr-independent fashion<sup><xref rid="c46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref></sup>. Perplexingly, the authors observed that agonist-stimulation of VIPR1 led to recruitment of βarr1 and receptor internalization into endosomes where VIPR1 and βarr1 colocalized. However, despite this potential interaction between VIPR1 and βarrs, the presence of βarr1/2 had little to no effect on receptor internalization and the ability of VIPR1 to activate G protein from endosomes<sup><xref rid="c46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref></sup>. As two independent studies using two different receptor systems now have found that endosomal G protein signaling can be achieved independent of βarrs, it is likely that this alternative mode of signaling represents a more general mechanism that is utilized by multiple GPCRs to regulate important physiological functions. Thus, further investigation into the details of βarr-independent receptor internalization and endosomal G protein signaling is much needed.</p>
<p>In summary, in the present study we gain new insights into how internalized V<sub>2</sub>R stimulates G protein signaling from endosomes, which require us to modify the current model (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). We demonstrated that V<sub>2</sub>R-mediated endosomal G protein activation is not restricted to the Gα<sub>s</sub> isoform but also occurs with the Gα<sub>q/11</sub> isoforms. A major part of this endosomal G protein activation is βarr-dependent, and presumably takes place through the formation of V<sub>2</sub>R–G protein–βarr megaplexes. Interestingly, the presence of βarrs in these megaplexes potentiates the ability of the V<sub>2</sub>R to activate G protein within endosomes. Surprisingly, we found that this mechanism is not the only way internalized V<sub>2</sub>R stimulates G protein signaling from endosomes since this event can take place in a completely βarr-independent fashion as well. The underlying details of how βarr-independent endosomal G protein activation by the V<sub>2</sub>R takes place is not known. However, since similar observation were made in another study of the VIPR1, the mechanism might represent a general aspect of GPCR biology that control important physiological and pathophysiological processes.</p>

The cells were equilibrated in Opti-MEM at 37°C for 60 minutes. Coelenterazine-h was added at a final concentration of 10 μM before starting the measurement. After establishing a baseline response for 2 minutes, cells were stimulated with AVP added at a final concentration of 100 nM and the luminescence was measured for additional 20 minutes. The signal was detected at 550 nm using a PHERAstar <italic>FSX</italic> instrument (BMG LabTech). ΔRLU is defined as the values of relative luminescence in presence of AVP minus the value obtained with vehicle.</p>

<title>Confocal microscopy</title>
<p>Cells containing DNA (fluorescent-tagged localization markers, Halo-mGsq, and receptors) were seeded in 8-well glass chambered slides (Ibidi GMBH) at 30,000 cells per well. The day of the assay, HaloTag® Oregon Green® Ligand (Promega) was added to cells at a final concentration of 1 μM in the culture media and incubated 15 minutes (37°C, 5% CO<sub>2</sub>) to label Halo-mGsq. Cells were washed 3 times with the media and incubated 30 minutes (37°C, 5% CO<sub>2</sub>) for the last wash. The media was aspirated, replaced by Tyrode’s buffer and cells were stimulated with AVP or vehicle (water) for the required time at 37°C, 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. At the end of the incubation, the media was aspirated and cells were fixed by adding 300 μl per well of 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS (Thermo Scientific) and incubated at room temperature for 10 minutes. The paraformaldehyde solution was aspirated, replaced by DPBS and cells were incubated for 10 minutes before being replaced by Tyrode’s buffer (300 μl per well) and visualized on a SP8 confocal microscope (Leica) at 63X magnification. Images were quantified using Imaris cell imaging software version 9.9.1 (Bitplane, Oxford Instruments). For each image, a threshold for the red channel was established by selecting the lower intensity from the region of interest (plasma membrane, endosomes, or βarr2). The percentage of colocalization was determined by the percentage of the material from the red channel above threshold colocalized with the material from the green channel. To quantify the percentage of colocalization for confocal microscopy images, the “surfaces” module was selected isolating cells containing the region of interest for each image. Thresholds for each channel were established by selecting the lower intensity from the region of interest (plasma membrane, endosomes, or βarr2). Data are reported as red volume (red voxels) above the threshold that is co-localized with green volume (green voxels) above the threshold and reported as percentage.</p>

<title>ELISA</title>
<p>To measure the relative cell surface expression of V<sub>2</sub>R and V<sub>2</sub>β<sub>2</sub> (both tagged with a HA epitope at their amino-terminal), the same cell suspension containing DNA that was used for EbBRET assays was seeded in white 96-well plates (Greiner) previously coated with Poly-D-lysine at 30,000 cells/well (100 μl per well). Non transfected cells were used to establish the background of the assay. For the coating, Poly-D-Lysine solution (0.1 mg per ml; Cultrex) was added (50 μl per well) and the plates incubated at 37 °C for at least 30 minutes. Following the incubation, the solution was aspirated and wells washed two times with DPBS before adding the cell suspension containing DNA. 48 hours after seeding, cells were washed with DPBS and fixed by adding 50 μl per well of 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS (Thermo Scientific) and incubated at room temperature for 10 minutes. The fixing solution was aspirated and wells washed 3 times with the washing buffer (0.5% BSA in DPBS). The washing buffer was left in the wells for 10 minutes following the last wash. After the 10 minute incubation, the buffer was removed and 50 μl per well of monoclonal 3F10 anti-HA-Peroxidase (Sigma) 12.5 ng/ml in washing buffer was added and the plate incubated 1 hour at room temperature. The antibody was aspirated and wells washed 3 times with the washing buffer. The washing buffer was left in the wells for 10 minutes following the last wash and wells were washed again 3 times with DBPS only. After aspiration of the DPBS, 100 μl per well of SigmaFast™ OPD (Sigma) solution prepared as recommended by the manufacturer was added. Wells were incubated in presence of the OPD solution until the wells containing cells expressing receptors become yellow (typically 10 minutes). The reaction was stopped by addition of 25 μl per well of hydrochloride 3M in water. 100 μl per well were transferred to a transparent clear 96-well flat bottom plate (Corning) and absorbance at 492 nm was measured using a FLUOstar Omega microplate reader (BMG Labtech). The net absorbance represents the absorbance measured in presence of receptor minus the background (i.e. absorbance measured in absence of receptor).</p>

<p>This is a potentially <bold>important</bold> study that contributes to our understanding of the role of beta-arrestins in endosomal activation of the vasopressin type 2 receptors. While the methodology is innovative, the evidence provided is still <bold>incomplete</bold>, which precludes drawing strong conclusions from the current data.</p>

<p>The authors present a carefully controlled set of experiments that demonstrate an additional complexity for GPCR signalling in that endosomal signalling make be different when beta-arrestin is or isn't associated with a G protein-bound V2 vasopressin receptor. It uses state of the art biosensor-based approaches and beta-arrestin KO lines to assess this. It adds to a growing body of evidence that G proteins and beta-arresting can associate with GPCR complexes simultaneously. They also demonstrate the possibility that Gq might also be activated by the V2 receptor. My sense is one thing they may need to be considered is the possibility of such &quot;megacomplexes&quot; might actually involve receptor dimers or oligomers.</p>

<p>This manuscript by Daly et al., probes the emerging paradigm of GPCR signaling from endosomes using the V2R as a model system with an emphasis on Gq/11 and β-arrestins. The study employs cellular imaging, enzyme complementation assays and energy transfer-based sensors to probe the potential formation of GPCR-G-protein-β-arrestin megaplexes. While the study is certainly very interesting, it appears to be very preliminary at many levels, and clearly requires further development in order to make robust conclusions.</p>
<p>1. The use of mini-G-proteins in these experiments is a major concern as these are highly engineered and may not represent the true features of G-proteins. While these have been used as a readout in other publications, their use in demonstrating megaplex formation is sub-optimal, and native, full-length G-proteins should be used.</p>
<p>
2. The interpretation of complementation (NanoLuc) or proximity (BRET) as evidence of signaling not appropriate, especially when overexpression system and engineered constructs are being used.</p>
<p>
3. After the original work from the same corresponding authors on megaplex formation, the major challenge in the field is to demonstrate the existence and relevance of megaplex formation at endogenous levels of components, and the current study focuses solely on showing the proximity of Gq and β-arrestins.</p>
<p>
4. The study lacks a coherent approach, and the assays are often shifted back and forth between the two β-arrestin isoforms (1 and 2), for example, confocal vs. complementation etc.</p>
<p>
5. In every assay, only the G-proteins and β-arrestins are monitored without a direct assessment of the presence of receptor, and absent that data, it is difficult to justify calling these entities megaplexes.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the authors should consider expanding on this work further to make the points more convincingly to make the work solid and impactful. The two corresponding authors are among the leaders in the field having demonstrated the existence of megaplexes, and building on the work in a systematic fashion should certainly move the paradigm forward. As the work presented in the current manuscript is already pre-printed, the authors should take this opportunity to present a completer and more comprehensive story to the field.</p>

<p>The manuscript by Daly et al examines endosomal signaling of the vasopressin type 2 receptors using engineered mini G protein (mG proteins) and a number of novel techniques to address if sustained G protein signaling in the endosomal compartment is enhanced by β arrestin. Employing these interesting techniques they have how V2R could activates Gαs and Gα in the endosomal compartments and how this modulation could occur in arrestin dependent and independent manner. Although the phenomenon of endosomal signaling is complex to address the authors have tried their best to examine these using a number of well controlled set of experiments.</p>
