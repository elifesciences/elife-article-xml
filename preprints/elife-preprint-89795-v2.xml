<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Most animals have functionally distinct populations of taste cells, expressing receptors that are tuned to compounds of different valence. This organizational feature allows for discrimination between chemicals associated with specific taste modalities and facilitates differentiating between unadulterated foods and foods contaminated with toxic substances. In the fruit fly <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, primary sensory neurons express taste receptors that are tuned to distinct groups of chemicals, thereby activating neural ensembles that elicit either feeding or avoidance behavior. Members of a family of ligand gated receptor channels, the Gustatory receptors (Grs), play a central role in these behaviors. In general, closely related, evolutionarily conserved Gr proteins are co-expressed in the same type of taste neurons, tuned to chemically related compounds, and therefore triggering the same behavioral response. Here, we report that members of the Gr28 subfamily are expressed in largely non-overlapping sets of taste neurons in <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae, detect chemicals of different valence and trigger opposing feeding behaviors. We determined the intrinsic properties of <italic>Gr28</italic> neurons by expressing the mammalian Vanilloid Receptor (VR1), which is activated by capsaicin, a chemical to which wildtype <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae do not respond. When VR1 is expressed in <italic>Gr28a</italic> neurons, larvae become attracted to capsaicin, consistent with reports showing that <italic>Gr28a</italic> itself encodes a receptor for nutritious RNA. In contrast, expression of VR1 in two pairs of <italic>Gr28b.c</italic> neurons triggers avoidance to capsaicin. Moreover, neuronal inactivation experiments show that the <italic>Gr28b.c</italic> neurons are necessary for avoidance of several bitter compounds. Lastly, behavioral experiments of <italic>Gr28</italic> deficient larvae and live Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging studies of <italic>Gr28b.c</italic> neurons revealed that denatonium benzoate, a synthetic bitter compound that shares structural similarities with natural bitter chemicals, is a ligand for a receptor complex containing a Gr28b.c or Gr28b.a subunit. Thus, the <italic>Gr28</italic> proteins, which have been evolutionarily conserved over 260 million years in insects, represent the first taste receptor subfamily in which specific members mediate behavior with opposite valence.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Meaningful animal behavior is established through cooperative engagement of multiple sensory systems. In many insects, the chemosensory system plays a central role in such integration processes. The fruit fly <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> has served as the primary insect model system for elucidating the molecular basis and neural circuitry of both olfaction and taste, by virtue of the vast genetic resources, amenability to both neurophysiological recording and live imaging, and simple yet powerful behavioral assays, allowing investigators to link genes to chemosensory behavior and neural activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Montell, 2021</xref>).</p>
<p>The <italic>Drosophila</italic> gustatory system is characterized by several insect specific anatomical and molecular features. For example, taste cells are primary sensory neurons, with dendritic processes that express taste receptors, while long axons project and convey taste information directly to the brain. In adult flies, these neurons, referred to as Gustatory Receptor Neurons (GRNs) are distributed across several appendages, such as labial palps, legs and presumably the antennae. Additionally, some GRNs reside internally, arranged in cell clusters along the pharynx (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Amrein, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Joseph and Carlson, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Scott, 2018</xref>). Likewise, <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae have numerous structures located both on the head surface as well as internally along the larval pharynx, where chemical compounds are assessed during their passage towards the digestive system (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Apostolopoulou et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Kwon et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Rist and Thum, 2017</xref>).</p>

<p><bold>A) Schematic representation of the larval chemosensory system</bold>. Three external sensory organs (DO, TO and VO) hold collectively the dendritic extensions of neuronal cell bodies in the respective ganglia (DOG, TOG and VOG). Three clusters of sensory neurons (DPS, VPS and PPS) reside along the pharynx. The antennal nerve (AN) connects the DOG neurons to the subesophageal zone (SEZ). The TOG and VOG neurons project along the maxillary nerve (MN) to the SEZ. The DPS and PPS neurons project axons to the SEZ via the labral nerve (LRN). The VPS neurons project to the SEZ through the labial nerve (LBN). Note that olfactory neurons are omitted in the schematic here and in E (below).</p><p><bold>B) Structure of the <italic>Gr28</italic> locus.</bold> The six <italic>Gr28</italic> genes are clustered within 10 kilobases. The five <italic>Gr28b</italic> genes are transcribed from distinct promotors, with first unique exons that are spliced to common second and third exons. <italic>Gr28a</italic> is downstream of the <italic>Gr28b</italic> genes. The <italic>Gr28</italic> mutation (<italic>ÎGr28</italic>) used in this study lacks the shared common exons of the <italic>Gr28b</italic> genes and the entire <italic>Gr28a</italic> gene.</p><p><bold>C) Expression of the <italic>Gr28</italic> genes in the external sensory organs.</bold> Note that images show only one of the bilaterally symmetrical organs.

Immunostaining was performed on whole-mount preparations from larvae heads of the following genotypes: <italic>UAS-mCD8:RFP lexAop-rCD2:GFP;Gr66a-LexA/Gr28a-GAL4</italic>, <italic>UAS-mCD8:RFP lexAop-rCD2:GFP;Gr66a-LexA/Gr28b.c-GAL4</italic>, <italic>UAS-mCD8:RFP lexAop-rCD2:GFP;Gr66a-LexA/Gr28b.e-GAL4</italic> and <italic>UAS-mCD8:RFP lexAop-rCD2:GFP;Gr66a-LexA/+; Gr28b.a-GAL4/+</italic>.

</fig>
<p>Fruit flies, like most insects, employ taste receptors encoded by two major gene families, the <italic>Gustatory receptor</italic> (<italic>Gr</italic>) and the <italic>Ionotropic Receptor</italic> (<italic>IR</italic>) genes, to sense soluble chemicals, such as appetitive food compounds, noxious and toxic chemicals as well as pheromones. Both Gr- and IR- based receptors are thought to form complexes composed of several, and generally different, subunits. Composition of only a few Gr-based taste receptors for sugars and bitter compounds is known (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Jiao et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Yavuz et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Shim et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Sung et al., 2017</xref>) (Fujii et al., unpublished), and two Gr proteins, Gr21a and Gr63a, are co-expressed in a small subset of olfactory neurons where they form a receptor complex for gaseous carbon dioxide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Jones et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Kwon et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>The <italic>Gr</italic> genes represent the largest taste receptor gene family in insects. In <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, it is comprised of 60 genes predicted to encode 68 proteins, expression of which has been extensively described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Dahanukar et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Dunipace et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Fujii et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Scott et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Weiss et al., 2011</xref>). Several <italic>Gr</italic> genes have been functionally characterized in adult flies using genetic mutations combined with either electrophysiological recordings, Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging studies and behavioral analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Amrein, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Montell, 2021</xref>), but only a few have been studied in larvae (Apostolopoulou et al., 2016a; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Choi et al., 2016</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Mishra et al., 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">2018</xref>).</p>
<p>The <italic>Gr28</italic> gene subfamily is of particular interest for a number of reasons: First, it is one of the most conserved <italic>Gr</italic> subfamilies, homologs of which can be found across all insect families and even more distant arthropods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Eyun et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Fujii et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Suzuki et al., 2018</xref>). The six <italic>Gr28</italic> genes are tightly clustered, with the five <italic>Gr28b</italic> genes transcribed from distinct promotors and unique exons spliced to shared 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> exons, while <italic>Gr28a</italic> is a separate transcription unit (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). Overall conservation between the Gr28 proteins is high (equal or more than 50% similarity), characteristic for genes generated through recent gene duplication events. Second, the <italic>Gr28</italic> genes are expressed not only in the gustatory system of larvae and adult flies, but also in many other organs, especially the central nervous system (CNS) and non-chemosensory neurons of the peripheral nervous system (PNS), suggesting that they have functions beyond gustation and are important to sense chemical signals unrelated to food (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Mishra et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Thorne and Amrein, 2008</xref>). Notably, evidence for such roles has been reported before any direct link to gustatory perception was discovered. Ni and colleagues showed that <italic>Gr28b.d</italic> is essential for high temperature avoidance in flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Ni et al., 2013</xref>), while Xiang and collaborators found that <italic>Gr28</italic> mutant larvae were deficient in UV light avoidance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Xiang et al., 2010</xref>). Third, the only known gustatory function for any Gr28 protein thus far is sensing of RNA and ribose by Gr28a, mediated by <italic>Gr28a-GAL4</italic> GRNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Mishra et al., 2018</xref>). Remarkably, sensing RNA and ribose is an appetitive taste quality found in other dipteran insects that diverged from <italic>Drosophila</italic> about 260 million years ago, including flesh flies and mosquitoes, and we showed that <italic>Gr28</italic> homologs from <italic>A. aegypti</italic> and <italic>A. gambiae</italic> can restore RNA and ribose preference in <italic>Drosophila Gr28</italic> mutant larvae when expressed in <italic>Gr28a-GAL4</italic> GRNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Fujii et al., 2023</xref>).</p>
<p>Here, we present a detailed expression analysis and functional characterization of the <italic>Gr28</italic> genes and the respective GRNs in <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae. In addition to <italic>Gr28a,</italic> three of the five <italic>Gr28b</italic> genes (<italic>Gr28b.a, Gr28b.c</italic> and <italic>Gr28b.e</italic>) are also expressed in the larval taste system. Interestingly, GRNs expressing <italic>Gr28a</italic> and the three <italic>Gr28b</italic> genes represent functionally distinct neuronal ensembles, with minimal expression overlap in a single pair of neurons expressing both <italic>Gr28a</italic> and <italic>Gr28b.c</italic>. When the mammalian Vanilloid Receptor 1 (VR1) is expressed under the control of specific GAL4 drivers, we found that <italic>Gr28a-GAL4</italic> and <italic>Gr28b.c-GAL4</italic> neurons mediate opposing taste behavior in the presence of capsaicin, the ligand for VR1. Specifically, <italic>Gr28a-GAL4/UAS-VR1</italic> larvae show strong attraction for capsaicin, while <italic>Gr28b.c-GAL4/UAS-VR1</italic> larvae show strong avoidance of capsaicin. Neuronal inactivation experiments reveal that the <italic>Gr28b.c</italic> GRNs are necessary to sense bitter compounds, such as denatonium, quinine, lobeline, and caffeine. Moreover, Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses of <italic>Gr28b.c</italic> GRNs to denatonium and quinine are significantly reduced and avoidance behavior of these two chemicals is diminished in <italic>Gr28</italic> mutant larvae, whereas Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses and avoidance behavior were not affected when challenged with lobeline and caffeine. This implies that Gr28b proteins are subunits of receptor complexes sensing a subgroup of bitter tasting compounds. In summary, the <italic>Gr28</italic> genes encode related Gr proteins mediating both positive and negative valence.</p>

<title>Expression of the <italic>Gr28</italic> genes in the larval taste organs</title>
<p>The peripheral chemosensory system of the larvae is subdivided into bilaterally symmetrical, âexternalâ and âinternalâ taste organs (Stocker, 2008). The three external organs reside near the tip of the head and are organized as paired ganglia, the <underline>D</underline>orsal, <underline>T</underline>erminal and <underline>V</underline>entral <underline>O</underline>rgan <underline>G</underline>anglia (<underline>DOG</underline>s, <underline>TOG</underline>s and <underline>VOG</underline>s) that house the GRN cell bodies with dendritic extensions in respective sensory organs (DO, TO and VO) at the head surface, while carrying information via their axons to the subesophageal zone (SEZ) in the brain (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). The DOG harbors 21 olfactory neurons and 18 presumptive GRNs. For clarity, GRN numbers refer to neurons in one of the two, bilaterally symmetrical taste organs. The GRNs located in the DOG fall into two distinct groups, based on their dendritic extensions: 11 presumptive GRNs, four of which were shown to express <italic>Gr</italic> genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Apostolopoulou et al., 2015</xref>), send dendrites to the base of the DO, while 7 neurons extend dendrites to the TO (the dorsolateral group, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Kwon et al., 2011</xref>). The TOG contains 30 neurons, with dendrites located in the TO (the distal group). The internal taste structures, referred to as the <underline>D</underline>orsal/<underline>V</underline>entral <underline>P</underline>haryngeal <underline>S</underline>ense organ (DPS/VPS, 33 neurons) and the <underline>P</underline>osterior <underline>P</underline>haryngeal <underline>S</underline>ense organs (PPS, 6 neurons) are located along the pharynx and sense chemicals as they are moved towards the digestive system. We note that not all these neurons are confirmed GRNs, either by function or expression of <italic>Gr</italic> or <italic>IR</italic> genes, albeit based on their location and anatomy, most are thought to be GRNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Rist and Thum, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">SÃ¡nchez-AlcaÃ±iz et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Stewart et al., 2015</xref>).</p>
<p>Our initial expression analysis of the <italic>Gr28</italic> genes revealed that four of the six <italic>Gr28</italic> genes (<italic>Gr28a</italic>, <italic>Gr28b.a</italic>, <italic>Gr28b.c</italic> and <italic>Gr28b.e</italic>) were expressed in larval taste organs, in addition to cells in the gut, the brain and non-chemosensory cells of the larvae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Mishra et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Thorne and Amrein, 2008</xref>). This and all previous <italic>Gr</italic> expression studies were performed using bimodal expression systems, mostly <italic>GAL4/UAS</italic>, whereby <italic>Gr</italic> promotors driving <italic>GAL4</italic> are assumed to faithfully reproduce expression of the respective <italic>Gr</italic> genes. Importantly, we analyzed two or four <italic>Gr28-GAL4</italic> insertion lines for each transgene, and at least two generated the same expression pattern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Mishra et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Thorne and Amrein, 2008</xref>) providing evidence that the drivers reflect a fairly accurate expression profile of respective endogenous genes. To further delineate the putative chemosensory roles of these genes, we performed a more detailed co-expression analysis between the <italic>Gr28</italic> genes and the bitter receptor gene <italic>Gr66a</italic> by combining the <italic>GAL4/UAS</italic> (labeling <italic>Gr28</italic> expressing neurons) with the <italic>LexA/lexAop</italic> (marking <italic>Gr66a</italic> neurons) system (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1D</xref>). In the TOG, we found expression of all four <italic>Gr28</italic> genes, along with that of <italic>Gr66a</italic>, which was expressed in 3 or 4 neurons (this number is slightly smaller than the 6 neurons previously reported by (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Kwon et al., 2011</xref>). <italic>GAL4</italic> drivers for <italic>Gr28b.a</italic>, <italic>Gr28b.c</italic> and <italic>Gr28b.e</italic> are co-expressed in a single neuron with <italic>Gr66a-LexA</italic> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). In contrast, <italic>Gr28a-GAL4</italic> is expressed in a distinct TOG neuron than <italic>Gr66a-LexA</italic> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>) and the <italic>Gr28b</italic> genes, an observation we independently confirmed using a <italic>Gr28b.c-LexA</italic> driver (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>-figure supplement 1). In the DOG, we find only a single <italic>Gr28a-GAL4</italic> neuron, while none of the <italic>Gr28b</italic> genes, or <italic>Gr66a</italic>, is expressed there (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). None of the <italic>Gr28-GAL4</italic> drivers was expressed in the VOG. In the internal sensory organs, <italic>Gr66a-LexA</italic> is found in one GRN in the DPS/VPS, where it is co-expressed with <italic>Gr28b.c-GAL4</italic> as well as <italic>Gr28a-GAL4</italic> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>).

In summary, the internal sensory organs can be subdivided in three distinct groups (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>): <italic>Gr66a/Gr28b.c/Gr28a</italic> positive neurons, <italic>Gr66a/Gr28a</italic> positive neurons and <italic>Gr28a<sup>only</sup></italic> neurons, which contrasts the external sensory organs where <italic>Gr28a</italic> and the <italic>Gr28b</italic> genes are expressed in a mutually exclusive fashion.</p>

<title>Subsets of <italic>Gr28</italic> neurons mediate opposing feeding behaviors</title>
<p>We previously showed that at least one of the six <italic>Gr28</italic> genes is necessary for feeding attraction to RNA, ribonucleosides and ribose using a well-established two choice feeding assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Mishra et al., 2018</xref>)(<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). Specifically, larvae homozygous mutant for <italic>Gr28</italic> (<italic>ÎGr28</italic>, a deletion of the entire <italic>Gr28a</italic> gene and more than half of the coding region of all <italic>Gr28b</italic> genes, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>), lose their ability to sense these compounds, a phenotype that is restored when single <italic>UAS-Gr28</italic> reporter transgenes are expressed in <italic>Gr28a-GAL4</italic> neurons. The largely non-overlapping expression of <italic>Gr28a</italic> and the <italic>Gr28b</italic> genes suggests that respective neurons represent functionally distinct entities. To investigate this possibility, we took advantage of the mammalian Vanilloid Receptor 1 (VR1), a TRP channel that is activated by capsaicin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Caterina et al., 1997</xref>). <italic>Drosophila</italic> have no <italic>VR1</italic> like-gene in their genome and do not respond to capsaicin behaviorally, but flies are attracted to this chemical when a modified <italic>VR1</italic> gene (<italic>VR1E600K</italic>) is expressed in sweet taste neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Marella et al., 2006</xref>). Thus, we expressed <italic>VR1E600K</italic> (henceforth referred to <italic>UAS-VR1</italic>) under the control of the four <italic>Gr28-GAL4</italic> drivers (<italic>Gr28a-GAL4</italic>, <italic>Gr28b.a-GAL4</italic>, <italic>Gr28b.c-GAL4</italic> and <italic>Gr28b.e-GAL4</italic>) in larvae and tested their response to capsaicin using the two-choice preference assay (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). Additionally, we expressed <italic>UAS-VR1</italic> in bitter neurons as well as appetitive fructose sensing neurons using respective <italic>GAL4</italic> drivers (<italic>Gr66a-GAL4</italic> and <italic>Gr43a<sup>GAL4</sup></italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Mishra et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Scott et al., 2001</xref>), which served as control larvae (note that fructose sensing <italic>Gr43a<sup>GAL4</sup></italic> neurons are distinct from <italic>Gr28a-GAL4</italic> neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Mishra et al., 2018</xref>)). Just like adult flies, <italic>w<sup>1118</sup></italic>control larvae lacking either a <italic>UAS-VR1</italic> reporter, a <italic>Gr-GAL4</italic> driver, or both, were unresponsive to 0.1 mM capsaicin, while the positive control larvae expressing <italic>UAS-VR1</italic> in either fructose sensing GRNs or bitter taste GRNs showed robust attraction to or avoidance of capsaicin (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). Consistent with previous findings, which identified <italic>Gr28a</italic> GRNs as appetitive neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Mishra et al., 2018</xref>), larvae expressing <italic>UAS-VR1</italic> under the control of <italic>Gr28a-GAL4</italic> showed strong appetitive responses to capsaicin (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). In contrast, larvae expressing <italic>UAS-VR1</italic> under the control of <italic>Gr28b.c-GAL4</italic> showed robust avoidance behavior to capsaicin, while expression in the single TOG GRN using either <italic>Gr28b.a-GAL4</italic> or <italic>Gr28b.e-GAL4</italic> (also expressing <italic>Gr28b.c</italic>; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>) caused neither attraction to nor avoidance of capsaicin.</p>

Experimental larvae expressing VR1 in <italic>Gr28-GAL4</italic> neurons are shown in blue. Positive control larvae (purple panels) expressing VR1 in bitter taste GRNs (<italic>Gr66a-Gal4</italic>) or appetitive, sweet GRNs (<italic>Gr43a<sup>GAL4</sup></italic>) show expected avoidance to or preference for capsaicin. Experimental larvae (blue panels) expressing VR1 in <italic>Gr28a-GAL4</italic> GRNs display robust preference for capsaicin, which is still observed when expression is further restricted to <italic>Gr28a<sup>only</sup></italic> GRNs (<italic>Gr66a-LexA/UAS-VR1; Gr28a-GAL4/lexAop-GAL80</italic>; right panel). In contrast, when VR1 is expressed in <italic>Gr28b.c-GAL4</italic> GRNs, larvae strongly avoid capsaicin.

<p>Overlap between <italic>Gr28a</italic> and <italic>Gr66a</italic> in internal GRNs raises the question about their contribution to appetitive and/or avoidance behavior. We deemed it unlikely that these neurons were critical for appetitive behavior, since the one pair located in the DPS/VPS (expressing also <italic>Gr28b.c</italic>) is necessary for capsaicin avoidance (see above). Indeed, when VR1 was suppressed in all <italic>Gr66a/Gr28b.c</italic> neurons by means of the GAL4 suppressor GAL80, these larvae, expressing VR1 in <italic>Gr28a<sup>only</sup></italic> GRNs remained strongly attracted to capsaicin (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref> last panel; for effective suppression, see <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>- figure supplement 1). Taken together, this analysis indicates that <italic>Gr28a-GAL4</italic> is expressed in appetitive inducing neurons, while <italic>Gr28b.c-GAL4</italic> neurons mediate avoidance behavior.</p>
<p>The capsaicin experiments above suggest that the two larval <italic>Gr28b.c-GAL4</italic> GRNs mediate negative valence. Previous reports have shown that larvae avoid many bitter compounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Apostolopoulou et al., 2016b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Choi et al., 2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">van Giesen et al., 2016</xref>), and thus, we expected that eliminating activity of <italic>Gr28b.c-GAL4</italic> GRNs would result in loss of avoidance behavior to at least some bitter chemicals. Indeed, when <italic>Gr28b.c-GAL4</italic> GRN activity was blocked using the inward rectifying potassium channel Kir2.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Baines et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Paradis et al., 2001</xref>), larvae no longer avoided the four tested bitter compounds denatonium, quinine, lobeline and caffeine (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). A compound specific avoidance phenotype to lobeline and caffeine was observed when the <italic>Gr28b.e-GAL4</italic> GRNs in the TOG was inactivated. These data, together with the capsaicin experiments, suggest that two pairs of GRNs, one in the TOG and one in the DPS/VPS are necessary and sufficient for avoidance of these four bitter tasting chemicals.</p>

<title>Gr28b.c and Gr28b.a are subunits of a taste receptor complex for denatonium</title>
<p>We next examined whether any of the Gr28b proteins is part of a taste receptor complex detecting any of these bitter chemicals (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>). Surprisingly, only avoidance of denatonium was affected in larvae lacking the <italic>Gr28</italic> gene cluster (<italic>ÎGr28</italic>; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>), while avoidance to quinine was somewhat reduced, albeit not significantly, and avoidance to lobeline or caffeine remained robust. In fact, avoidance to caffeine increased modestly, but significantly (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). We then examined whether any of the Gr28 proteins was sufficient to restore denatonium avoidance by expressing individual <italic>Gr28</italic> genes under the control of the <italic>Gr28b.c-GAL4</italic> driver. Indeed, either <italic>Gr28b.a</italic> or <italic>Gr28b.c</italic> expression led to a full recovery of denatonium avoidance, while expression of any other <italic>Gr28b</italic> gene, or <italic>Gr28a</italic>, failed to do so (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>).

<p>Since <italic>Gr66a-LexA</italic> is co-expressed in all <italic>Gr28b-GAL4</italic> expressing GRNs, we wondered whether Gr66a is a component of the denatonium receptor. Previous work had established that <italic>Gr66a</italic> is required for caffeine avoidance, in both larvae and adult flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Apostolopoulou et al., 2016b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Lee et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Moon et al., 2006</xref>), which we confirmed (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>-figure supplement 1). Surprisingly, avoidance of denatonium and quinine was not diminished, but increased significantly (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>-figure supplement 1). Given the multimeric nature of bitter taste receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Sung et al., 2017</xref>), one possibility is that the absence of a Gr subunit not required for the detection of denatonium (Gr66a) could favor formation of multimeric complexes containing Gr subunits that recognize this compound (such as Gr28b.a and/or Gr28b.c).</p>
<p>Finally, we investigated neuronal responses in larvae expressing the Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator GCaMP6m in <italic>Gr28b.c-GAL4</italic> GRNs (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>). We developed a whole animal imaging preparation, whereby larvae were placed in an âimaging chamberâ to minimize head movements (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>), and visualized neural activity of the <italic>Gr28b.c-GAL4</italic> GRN in the TOG in real time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Chen et al., 2013</xref>) upon exposure to the four bitter compounds, as well as sucrose, ribose and fructose (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref> to <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5D</xref>).

<p>Previous studies in adult <italic>Drosophila</italic> have shown that members of conserved Gr protein families such as the carbon dioxide receptors (<italic>Gr21a</italic> and <italic>Gr63a</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Jones et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Kwon et al., 2007</xref>) or the receptors for sweet taste encoded by the eight sugar <italic>Gr</italic> genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Fujii et al., 2015</xref>) are largely co-expressed in one type of neuron in the flyâs taste organs. For example, with the exception of <italic>Gr5a</italic> (see below), sugar <italic>Gr</italic> genes are only expressed in a single GRN (the âsweetâ neuron) of each taste sensilla, and activation of these âsweetâ neurons by sugars requires the function of at least two of the 8 sugar <italic>Gr</italic> genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Dahanukar et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Yavuz et al., 2014</xref>)(Fujii et al., unpublished). Similarly, the approximately 33 putative bitter taste receptors, which comprise several small conserved subfamilies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Robertson et al., 2003</xref>), as well as individual <italic>Gr</italic> genes with little overall similarity to one another, are partially co-expressed in a the bitter GRN of each taste sensilla (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Weiss et al., 2011</xref>). Molecular genetic studies combined with electrophysiological recordings have shown that at least three different Gr subunits are required to constitute functional receptor complexes that can sense a bitter compound (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Shim et al., 2015</xref>). We note that two rare exceptions to the heteromeric nature of taste receptor complexes exist, namely the RNA receptor Gr28a and the fructose receptor Gr43, which have been proposed to function as homomultimeric complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Mishra et al., 2018</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">2013</xref>). Cryo-EM structural analysis of the conserved insect Olfactory receptor co-receptor (ORCO) suggests that insect odorant receptors form tetramers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Butterwick et al., 2018</xref>), and biochemical characterization and comparative modeling of BmGr9, the <italic>Bombyx</italic> mori homolog of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> Gr43a fructose receptor, supports such structures for Gr proteins as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Morinaga et al., 2022</xref>).</p>

<title>Distinct functions are mediated by small set of GRNs expressing specific Gr28 subunits</title>
<p>Our expression analysis of the bitter taste receptor gene <italic>Gr66a</italic> and the <italic>Gr28</italic> genes in larvae is consistent with earlier studies, despite some small variation in neuron number (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Choi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Kwon et al., 2011</xref>), which is likely due to the use of different <italic>GAL4</italic> driver lines and/or variability in expression levels. Importantly, all <italic>Gr28b</italic> genes are co-expressed with the bitter taste receptor <italic>Gr66a</italic> (Figure1) and probably several other putative bitter <italic>Gr</italic> genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Kwon et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Rist and Thum, 2017</xref>), while <italic>Gr28a</italic> is found in a largely, but not entirely, distinct set of GRNs. Whether and what kind of <italic>Gr</italic> genes might be co-expressed with <italic>Gr28</italic> in <italic>Gr28<sup>only</sup></italic> GRNs will require more in-depth expression studies and might shed light on other receptors involved in appetitive behaviors of larvae.</p>
<p>A key finding of the work presented here is the observation that <italic>Gr28a<sup>only</sup></italic>and <italic>Gr28b.c</italic> neurons dictate distinct behavioral programs, the former representing an ensemble of neurons that instruct larvae to âgo towardsâ a chemical source and consume it, while the latter do the opposite (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). This observation is reminiscent of a seminal study by Troemel and colleagues in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> chemosensory system, who reported that the valence of a chemical compound is dependent on the identity of a neuron, and not the identity of the molecular receptor the neuron expresses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Troemel et al., 1997</xref>). The number of âgo-awayâ GRNs in <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae co-expressing <italic>Gr28b.c</italic> and <italic>Gr66a</italic> is remarkably small, consisting of only two pairs, one in the TO and the other in the DPS/VPS. It seems likely that this is the smallest, minimal subset of neurons sufficient to induce avoidance behavior, as expression of V1R in only the TO pair (under the control of either <italic>Gr28b.a-GAL4</italic> or <italic>Gr28b.e-GAL4</italic>) has no behavioral effect when challenged with capsaicin. The âgo-toâ neurons are characterized by expression of <italic>Gr28a</italic> and represent a slightly larger set of four GRN pairs (<italic>Gr28a<sup>only</sup></italic> GRNs). Thus, the minimal requirement to induce âgo-toâ and âgo-awayâ behavior is defined by distinct sets of GRNs, and each appears to be composed of neurons located in both external as well as the internal taste organs (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>). Co-expression of the RNA receptor Gr28a and in the DPS/VPS GRN essential for bitter taste (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2B</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>) raises interesting questions about additional functions for Gr28a in bitter taste. We note that the sweet taste receptor Gr5a, a subunit of a multimeric trehalose receptor, is also expressed in non-sweet neurons of unknown function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Fujii et al., 2015</xref>).</p>

<title>Functional redundancy of taste receptors</title>
<p>Both behavioral analyses as well as Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging experiments implicate at least one Gr28b protein as an essential component of a denatonium receptor complex, as <italic>ÎGr28</italic> larvae exhibit total loss of avoidance (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>), and respective GRNs fail to elicit a response upon exposure to this chemical (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). What the precise composition of that complex is remains to be determined, but recovery of denatonium responses by expressing either Gr28b.c and/or Gr28b.a indicates that either one of these (or possibly both) is an essential subunit, in addition to other Grs expressed in this GRNs, such as Gr22a and Gr59c (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Choi et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Rist and Thum, 2017</xref>), while Gr66a is unlikely to be part of such a complex based on our behavioral analysis (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>-figure supplement 1).</p>
<p>Since only Gr28b.a and Gr28b.c can rescue denatonium responses in <italic>Gr28b.c</italic> GRNs of <italic>ÎGr28</italic> mutant larvae, sequence comparison between the unique N-terminal halves of the Gr28 proteins comprising the first four transmembrane domains and the extracellular loops 1 and 2 might provide insights as to possible residues important for ligand recognition. When interrogating these regions, only seven residues are identical between Gr28b.a and Gr28b.c (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>). Reducing the stringency requirement by allowing one of the remaining receptors to share the same residue, nine additional sites are identified. One experimental avenue to validate these residues as important sites contributing to denatonium binding might involve introduction of point mutations that converts respective amino acids of other Gr28b proteins into those found in Gr28b.a/Gr28b.c.</p>

<p>The role of Gr28b proteins in quinine detection is less clear, and the different phenotypes observed in behavioral experiments and Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging suggest that at least two molecular types of quinine receptors exist in larvae. Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging experiments implicate a role for multiple Gr28b subunits in a quinine receptor complex in the TOG neuron, since single <italic>Gr28b</italic> genes cannot restore the loss of quinine response in <italic>ÎGr28</italic> larvae (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5G</xref>). However, because <italic>ÎGr28</italic> mutant larvae still avoid quinine (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>), at least one Gr28b independent receptor must be exist in one or several other GRNs, one of which is likely the DPS/VPS, since expression of Kir2.1 in that neuron, along with the TOG neuron, totally abolishes quinine avoidance (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). We note that functional redundancy is also observed in sweet taste receptors, where we found that different combinations of sugar <italic>Gr</italic> genes can restore responses to the same sugar when expressed in tarsal sweet GRNs of sugar blind flies (Fujii et al. unpublished).</p>

After the agarose solidified, one half was removed and replaced with 1% agarose solution containing taste ligands (capsaicin or bitter compound). For each experiment, 15 larvae from food vials were briefly rinsed twice with Millipore Q water and placed along the middle separating pure and ligand containing agarose. After 16 min, images were taken for record keeping and used to calculate larval preference indices. Larvae that crawled onto the wall of a dish or dug in the agarose were excluded. The preference index (P.I.) was calculated as follow: PI = (N<sub>tastant</sub> - N<sub>plain</sub>) / N<sub>Total,</sub> whereby N is the number of larvae in the tastant sector, the plain agarose sector and the total number, respectively.

Millipore Q water (40 Âµl) was applied to the tip of the larval head, and the preparation was placed on the stage of a Nikon eclipse Ti inverted microscope. Images were obtained every 500 ms, starting 15 s before application and ending 105 s after ligand application. Each recording was initiated by applying water (40Î¼l) to set a baseline. The first ligand solution (40 Î¼l of bitter chemical or sugar) was applied thereafter, followed by 5 washes with carrier (100 Î¼l of water). After a 3-minute pause to allow the preparation to recalibrate, a second ligand solution (40 Î¼l bitter chemical or sugar) was applied.

<p>Ahn and Amrein characterize the expression of members of the Gr28 family of gustatory receptors in taste neurons in the Drosophila melanogaster larva, define the behaviorally-relevant ligands for these receptors, and use chemogenetic experiments to show, strikingly, that different neurons have opposite behavioral responses to the chemogenetic ligand. They go on to show what neurons need to be silenced to lose responses to bitters, and very nicely show what subunits of the Gr28 bitter receptors are necessary and sufficient for responses to bitters. This is a nice piece of work, rigorously carried out, that tackles the neurons and receptors that drive innate responses to tastants in Drosophila larvae.</p>
<p>The authors have revised the paper to address all of my recommendations. The new cartoons are extremely clear and I appreciate the more measured language when discussing the hypothetical structure and stoichiometry of the functional GR complex.</p>

<p>This study investigates how genes in the Gr28 family of gustatory receptors function in the taste system of Drosophila larvae. Gr28 genes are intriguing because they have been implicated in taste as well as other functions, such as sensing temperature and ultraviolet light. This study makes several new findings. First, the authors show that four Gr28 genes are expressed in putative taste neurons, and these neurons can be largely divided into subsets that express Gr28a versus Gr28bc. The authors then demonstrate that these two neuronal subsets drive opposing behaviors (attraction versus avoidance) when activated. The avoidance-promoting neurons respond to bitter compounds and are required for bitter avoidance, and Gr28bc and Gr28ba were specifically implicated in bitter detection in these cells. Together, these findings provide insight into the complexity of taste receptor expression and function in Drosophila, even within a single receptor subfamily.</p>
<p>The conclusions are well-supported by the experimental data. Strengths of the paper include the use of precise genetic tools, thorough analyses of expression patterns, carefully validated behavioral assays, and well-controlled functional imaging experiments. The role of Gr28bc neurons is more thoroughly explored than that of Gr28a neurons. However, a previous study from the same lab (Mishra et al., 2018) showed that Gr28a neurons detect RNA and ribose, which are attractive to larvae. Presumably this is the attractive response that is being recapitulated upon artificial activation of Gr28a neurons.</p>

<p>The following is the authorsâ response to the original reviews.</p>
<p>General comments:</p>
<p>To reviewer 1 and 3: The following sentences below were added at the beginning of the result section to clarify that the Gr gene expression analysis was performed using bimodal expression systems and to provide a reference that these expression profiles can generally be expected to represent endogenous Gr expression.</p>
<p>&quot;Note that this and all previous Gr expression studies were performed using bimodal expression systems, mostly GAL4/UAS, whereby Gr promotors driving GAL4 are assumed to faithfully reproduce expression of the respective Gr genes.  Importantly, we analyzed two or more Gr28-GAL4 insertion lines for each transgene, and at least two generated the same expression profiles (Mishra et al., 2018; Thorne and Amrein, 2008) providing evidence that the drivers reflect a fairly accurate expression profile of respective endogenous genes.&quot;</p>
<p>Specific comments:</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>The important chemogenetic behavioral data would benefit from a clearer presentation including a cartoon to explain what the behavior is and how it is scored. Figure 2 is the key figure in this paper and it would be helpful if the figure were reorganized to guide the non-expert reader to the key result. I recommend labeling the positive controls Gr43a as &quot;sweet&quot; and Gr66a as &quot;bitter&quot; and perhaps organize the presentation to have the negative control at the left, then Gr28ba that had no effect, then group Gr28a with Gr43a for positive valence and Gr28bc with Gr66a for negative valence. I'm not sure what the value is of showing both 0.1 mM and 0.5 mM capsaicin, the text does not explain. The experiment in Figure 2B is important but non-experts will not understand what is being done here - can the authors please provide a cartoon like those in Figure 1 showing what cells are being subjected to chemogenetics and how this differs from Figure 2A?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The reviewer is correct that much can be improved, which we hope to have accomplished with the modifications in Figure 2. We re-organized it to deliver the key result to non-expert readers in an easy way. We added cartoons both explaining how the two-choice preference assays were conducted and indicating which cells express UAS-VR1. The cartoon in Figure 1E and Figure 2A are now directly relatable and should clarify what cells express VR1 (in Figure 2). Positive and negative control experiments using Gr43aGAL4 (a GAL4 knock-in; Miyamoto et al., 2013) and Gr66a-GAL4 are highlighted in the Figure and mentioned upfront in the text to make clear to what the experimental larvae can be compared. We also excluded larvae responses to 0.5 mM capsaicin.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. The AlphaFold ligand docking in Figure 8 is conducted with Gr28bc monomers, which are unlikely to be the in vivo relevant structure, given that the related OR/ORCO ancestor structures are tetramers. I recommend that this component of the paper either be removed entirely or that the authors redo the in silico work using the AlphaFold-Multimer package reported by Hassabis and Jumper in 2022 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.10.04.463034v2">https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.10.04.463034v2</ext-link>. It will be interesting to see what a tetramer structure looks like with the ligand.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We tried but were able to use the recommended package. Even if it were, the problem is that we do not know the partner of Gr28b.c. And while it is not clear whether and how extensive changes in the ligand binding pockets occur when using the monomer prediciton vs a multimer package, we followed the reviewerâs suggestion and removed the modeling from the manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Minor points:</p>
<p>1. Line 80: I do not think it is biophysically or biochemically plausible that GRs and IRs would assemble into functional heteromeric channels and suggest that the authors either explain how that would work or remove this speculative comment.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have removed this sentence.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. Line 246-248: I would tone down the speculation about GR subunit composition - it's still too early days to understand the stoichiometry or the extent that any of the broadly expressed GRs is a co-receptor.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We did not indulge in the possible stoichiometry of Gr complexes, but merely mention that they are composed in general of two or more Gr subunits, for which clear genetic evidence exists: Up to three different putative bitter Gr genes are necessary to elicit responses to bitter compounds, and at least two putative sugar Gr genes are necessary to restore behavioral responses to any sweet tasting chemicals (sugars). Regardless, we have toned down the language, stating now:</p>
<p>âGiven the multimeric nature of bitter taste receptors (Sung et al., 2017), one possibility is that the absence of a Gr subunit not required for the detection of denatonium (Gr66a) could favor formation of multimeric complexes containing Gr subunits that recognize this compound (Gr28b.a and/or Gr28b.c).â</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. Line 284: I don't think that co-expression necessarily means that GRs form heteromultimeric channels. It's equally possible that the cell controls subunit assembly to avoid mixing and matching ligand-selective subunits at will. I would tone this down - it's still speculative at this stage. We don't even know yet how this works for OR-Orco, where we do have structures. There is not yet an OR-Orco Cryo-EM structure, so we do not know what the subunit stoichiometry is.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We are not sure what the reviewerâs concern is. While direct biochemical or biophysical evidence is currently lacking, there is strong genetic evidence for heteromeric composition of Gr complexes, both from studies of bitter and sweet receptors/neurons (see response above). It is likely that intrinsic properties facilitate assembly of certain Grs within a taste receptor complex. We have refrained from any speculation about stoichiometry, though given the relatedness of Grs and Ors, it would not be far-fetched to propose that taste receptor complexes are also tetrameric in nature, which was recently proposed for a homomeric channel of the bombyx mori homolog of Gr43a, BmGr9 (Morinaga et al., 2022).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. Line 305: the work of Emily Troemel and Cori Bargmann PMID: 9346234 should be cited in the Discussion. Theirs was the first experiment to show that valence was a feature of the neuron and not the receptor(s) it expresses.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have now cited this work in the discussion to acknowledge this important discovery.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. Figure 1 - the clarity of the organization of the figure could be improved for non-experts. For instance, can the key for the abbreviations be written out at the right of Figure 1A? Second, it is confusing to talk about DOG/TOG neurons &quot;projecting&quot; to the DO/TO - I think the authors mean dendritic innervation, not axons projecting. Maybe having a diagram that cartoons a closeup of the DOG/TOG neurons and how they innervate the cuticular structures would make this clearer. I struggled to go from the pretty staining at the left of B and C to the schematics at the right that colored in which neurons express which receptors.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate these comments regarding clarity and have amended Figure 1 and made necessary changes in the text and the Figure legend.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. Figure 3 would benefit from a summary cartoon relating back to the cartoons in Figure 1 to summarize what neurons the authors think are necessary for bitter avoidance.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We very much appreciate this suggestion and have increased clarity by referring to the carton in Figures 1 and 2.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. Figure 4B - the lowercase letters indicating Gr28 subunits that are being expressed under UAS control (bottom row of table &quot;UAS-Gr28&quot;) are easily confused for the lowercase letters a, b used throughout to signify significant differences. I recommend that the authors write out the gene names in this figure to clarify the genes in the rescue experiment.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We changed the text in the Figure accordingly.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. For non-experts it would be helpful to have a map of the Gr28 gene locus so that people understand the arrangement of the genes and how the Gal4 driver lines map onto the locus.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have now included such a map in Figure 1B.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>1. In the title and multiple times in the text (e.g. lines 121-122), the authors make the claim that different Gr28 genes mediate opposing behaviors. At first, I was not convinced of this claim, but I now believe it may be warranted if integrating the present results with results from Mishra et al., 2018. In the present study, the authors show that different neurons drive opposing behaviors, but they did not show that the genes themselves mediate opposing behaviors. They show evidence for the role of Gr28bc and Gr28ba in aversion, but not the role of Gr28a in attraction. I was thinking that there could be other receptors in Gr28a-expressing neurons that mediate attraction. However, Mishra et al. showed that mutation of all Gr28 genes abolishes preference for RNA/ribose as well as detection of these compounds by Gr28a+ neurons of the terminal organ, an impairment that could be rescued by expressing Gr28a (although Gr28b genes seem to have similar functions), and the present study shows that the other Gr28 genes are not co-expressed with Gr28a in the terminal organ. Is this the line of reasoning that we must take to come to the conclusion in the title? If so, I don't believe it comes through clearly in the paper.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate this observation. We have modified language in the abstract and the introduction to reflect previous reports of Gr28a as an RNA/ribose receptor (Mishra et al., 2018) and its conversation across dipteran insects (Fujii et al., 2023) where we showed that appetitive behavior for RNA can be mediated via the mosquito homologs in transgenic Drosophila larvae. The reviewer is correct in that there are other appetitive neurons, namely those expressing Gr43a, which defines a set distinct from and non-overlapping with Gr28a neurons (Mishra 2018). This additional information is included in the Figure 1, summarizing expression of the Gr28 genes, Gr66a and Gr43a.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. The Figure 6 schematic does not show Gr66a+ Gr28- cells as being connected to avoidance behavior. This seems misleading because it seems likely that these cells do promote avoidance (based on known functions of other Gr66a cells). Also, it is not clear what the red dashed line represents.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The Gr66a neurons are indeed also avoidance mediating, but it is not clear which subgroup of these neurons is necessary. Our analysis in Figure 2 using Gr28b.c driving Kir2.1 suggests that a small subset of Gr66a neurons is sufficient to mediate avoidance. It is, however, possible that other subsets not including Gr28b.c can also mediate avoidance. The figure has been modified accordingly, as has the model in Figure 7.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. I would suggest including the description of Figures 7-8 in the Results instead of the Discussion. In Figure 8, it would be helpful to superimpose labels for the transmembrane domains and extracellular/intracellular sides to better interpret the models.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The modeling was removed from the manuscript (see response above to reviewer 1).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. The finding that Gr66a mutants show increased denatonium and quinine avoidance (Figure 4 - figure supplement 1) seems like a non sequitur, as it does not relate to the analysis of Gr28 genes. I support the inclusion of these interesting results, but perhaps it could be stated why this experiment was conducted (e.g. as a positive control).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have reworded this section to make clear why Gr66a mutants were tested (possibly being part of a denatonium receptor complex).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. An introduction to the nomenclature and gene structure for the Gr28 genes would be helpful. It's not clear how they're all related, e.g. that the Gr28b genes share some exons whereas Gr28a is separate. The Results section alludes to &quot;the high level of similarity between these receptors&quot;, and some sort of reference or quantification for this statement would be useful. I also think naming the Gr28b genes with a period (e.g. &quot;Gr28b.c&quot;) may be more consistent with the literature.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have added the structure of the Gr28 genes in the Figure 1B, which was also a suggestion by reviewer 1, and we have amended the naming of the genes.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. Lines 79-80 state &quot;some GRNs express members of both families&quot;, but no citation is provided.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As this sentence was deleted, based on a comment by reviewer 1, this point becomes mute.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. There are several typos or grammatical mistakes that the authors may wish to correct (e.g. lines 73, 75, 91, 232, 334, 780, 788).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the reviewer pointing these errors out to us. The mistakes were corrected.</p>

<list-item><p>Silencing experiments suggest a role for Gr28bc in the avoidance of quinine (Figure 3), while imaging experiments do not support this role (Figure 5G). An explanation is needed to reconcile these findings.</p>
</list-item></list>
</disp-quote>
<p>The imaging experiments do support a role for Gr28b proteins in quinine detection in the specific TOG GRN used for all live imaging (Figure 5). This GRN in DGr28 larvae has a significantly lower Ca2+ responses to quinine compared to controls. However, the Ca2+ response could not be rescued to wild type levels by supplementing single Gr28b subunits, suggesting multiple Gr28b proteins are present in a quinine specific receptor complex in this GRN. Also note that Ca2+ responses of DGr28 larvae to quinine is not completely abolished, suggesting some redundancy, possible via Gr33a (Apostolopoulou et al., 2014), also supported by DGr28 larvae, which have still a robust avoidance to quinine. We are confident we have been clearer in arguing this point, both the result and especially the discussion section.</p>

<p>The silencing experiments asked the specific questions as to what neurons are necessary for avoidance of bitter chemicals. Gr28a-GAL4 and Gr28b.a-GAL4 neurons were omitted because the former mediate feeding preference and not avoidance, and the latter is expressed in the same neurons as Gr28b.e (Figure 1). The remaining two Gr28b genes, Gr28b.b-GAL4 and Gr28b.d-GAL4 are not expressed in the larval taste system (Mishra et al., 2018) as we stated in the introduction/result section, and they were therefore not included in the chemogenetic or Kir2.1 inactivation experiments. We included these genes in rescue experiments, simply to test whether or not they can restore function for sensing denatonium.</p>
