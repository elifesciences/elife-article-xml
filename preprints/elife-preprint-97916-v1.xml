<title>Abstract</title><p>Cancer patients often experience changes in mental health, prompting an exploration into whether nerves infiltrating tumors contribute to these alterations by impacting brain functions. Using a male mouse model for head and neck cancer, we utilized neuronal tracing techniques and show that tumor-infiltrating nerves indeed connect to distinct brain areas via the ipsilateral trigeminal ganglion. The activation of this neuronal circuitry led to behavioral alterations represented by decreased nest-building, increased latency to eat a cookie, and reduced wheel running. Tumor-infiltrating nociceptor neurons exhibited heightened activity, as indicated by increased calcium mobilization. Correspondingly, the specific brain regions receiving these neural projections showed elevated cFos and delta FosB expression in tumor-bearing mice, alongside markedly intensified calcium responses compared to non-tumor-bearing counterparts.</p>
<p>The genetic elimination of nociceptor neurons in tumor-bearing mice led to decreased brain Fos expression and mitigated the behavioral alterations induced by the presence of the tumor. While analgesic treatment successfully restored behaviors involving oral movements to normalcy in tumor-bearing mice, it did not have a similar therapeutic effect on voluntary wheel running. This discrepancy points towards an intricate relationship, where pain is not the exclusive driver of such behavioral shifts. Unraveling the interaction between the tumor, infiltrating nerves, and the brain is pivotal to developing targeted interventions to alleviate the mental health burdens associated with cancer.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The prevalence of mental health disorders (e.g., depression, anxiety, suicide) in cancer patients is significantly greater than in the general population <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. For those patients with no prior psychiatric history, a cancer diagnosis increases the risk of mental health decline <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>. The presence of cancer introduces many stressors (physical, financial, relational) into the lives of patients, thus a negative impact on mental health may not be surprising. However, these changes persist even in long-term cancer survivors. For instance, decade-long cancer survivors maintain an increased incidence of depression (approximately 12%, depending on the cancer type) as compared to the population at large (3-5%) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. While the intensity and prevalence of psychological symptoms in cancer patients fluctuate before, during, and after treatment for a given type of cancer, and between cancer types, it remains higher than in the general population <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>. Whether the association of cancer with impaired mental health is directly mediated by the disease, its treatment or both remains unclear, yet it suggests that the development of a tumor may alter brain functions.</p>
<p>We have demonstrated the presence of TRPV1-expressing nociceptor neurons in head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>, melanoma, cervical <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>, and ovarian cancers <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. Nerve recruitment to the tumor bed is an active process that involves the release of soluble factors, including neurotrophins <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup> and neuropeptides <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. Tumor-released small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) also recruit loco-regional nerves to the tumor bed <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. While these and other studies establish that solid peripheral tumors engage with the peripheral nervous system <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>, it raises the possibility of a direct neuronal connection from the tumor to the brain.</p>
<p>A recent study used pseudorabies virus and mapped a connection from tumor-infiltrating nerves in an orthotopic model of murine lung cancer to areas in the brain <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>. We expand these findings and demonstrate that HNSCC-associated nerves are transcriptionally and functionally altered and project to discrete regions in the brain. The brain neurons connected to the tumor harbor increased activity, which is associated with behavioral alterations in tumor-bearing animals. Consistent with this, newly diagnosed HNSCC patients suffer high rates of depression and anxiety and lower quality of life <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>. As most cancer patients face cancer-related pain <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>, we tested whether treating pain could restore normal behavior. While pain treatment restored normal function at the tumor site, such as nesting behavior, it only partially restored normal voluntary running wheel behavior. Our findings suggest that, in addition to pain, tumor-infiltrating nerves communicate signals to the brain that lead to cancer-associated changes in behavior.</p>

<title>Tumor innervation begins early in disease</title>
<p>MOC2-7 cells are HNSCC cancer cells derived from a CXCR3 null mouse under a C57BL/6 background <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>. Their implantation in male mice results in dense innervation of tumors with nociceptor nerves<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>. To define the timing of tumor innervation, wildtype male mice were orthotopically implanted (oral cavity) with MOC2-7 cells, and tumors were collected on days 4-, 10-, and 20- post-implantation. Western blot analysis of whole tumor lysate indicated expression of Tau, a neuronal marker <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>, as early as day four post-tumor implantation, which increased over time (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>; full westerns in <bold>Supplemental Fig. 1A-B</bold>; densitometric quantification of westerns, <bold>Supplemental Fig. 1E</bold>). A similar increase in the neuronal marker doublecortin (DCX) was noted (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>; full western <bold>Supplemental Fig. 1C-D</bold>; densitometric quantification of westerns, <bold>Supplemental Fig. 1F</bold>). While DCX is well-known for its expression in immature neurons, it is also expressed in adult peripheral neurons, including dorsal root ganglia <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>, and in non-neuronal tissues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>. The DCX signal did not originate from the tumors, as MOC2-7 cell lysate was negative for this protein (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>, Full western <bold>Supplemental Fig 1C</bold>). Consistent with this, immunohistochemical staining of these tumors with the neuronal marker β-III tubulin (β3T), demonstrated the increasing presence of nerves beginning on day four post-tumor implantation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C-E</xref>).</p>

<title>Tumor-infiltrating nerves map to the ipsilateral trigeminal ganglion and into the CNS</title>
<p>To map the origin of tumor-infiltrating nerves and define the circuits they converge upon, mice with palpable oral MOC2-7 tumors (approximately day 15 post-tumor implantation) were intra-tumorally injected with wheat germ agglutinin, WGA, a neural tracer conjugated to a fluorophore (n= 10 mice). WGA is a lectin molecule that specifically binds to sialic acid residues present ubiquitously on neuronal membranes. It has been utilized extensively to map neuronal circuits centrally and in the periphery <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup> and is a known transganglionic and transynaptic neuronal tracer <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup> making it ideal for mapping neural circuits <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref></sup>. Following tracer injection, tumor growth was permitted for an additional 3-7 days to allow time for tracer labeling to occur. Animals were then euthanized, and tumors, trigeminal (TGM) ganglia, and brains were harvested and analyzed by microscopy. Microscopic examination of tumors revealed nerves with robust WGA signals (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1F</xref>) as well as the V3 branch of the ipsilateral, but not the contralateral, TGM ganglion (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1G,H</xref>). Consistent with the restricted labeling of tumor-infiltrating nerves, the tracer did not diffuse outside the tumor mass (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1I</xref>).</p>
<p>Examination of brains from MOC2-7 tumor-bearing animals revealed tracer<sup>+</sup> neurons in specific regions [including spinal nucleus of the trigeminal (SpVc), parabrachial nucleus (PBN), and central amygdala (CeA)] (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1J</xref>). Sections of brain from these regions show the presence of tracer-positive neurons (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1K</xref>). Tracer injections of equivalent volume and concentration into the oral cavities of control non-tumor-bearing animals did not label the TGM ganglia nor areas in the brain (data not shown). A larger volume (10μl) of tracer injected into non-tumor bearing mice resulted in tracer labeling of ipsilateral TGM neurons and brain (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1L</xref>). These control studies indicate that the nerve density and distribution present in the tumor bed are higher than in control mice, with the consequence that a small volume (2 μl instead of 10 µl) of tracer is sufficient to result in nerve labeling. The mapped circuit encompasses pre-existing connections to brain areas that regulate pain and affect <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref></sup>. These data indicate that the nerve infiltration into the tumor extends this circuit.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2c">
<title>Tumor-infiltrating neurons are transcriptionally modified</title>
<p>The observation of nerves infiltrating the tumor mass prompted us to ask whether they undergo alterations by their mere presence within this “foreign” environment. Consistent with this, we previously found that melanoma-infiltrating neurons have a unique transcriptome <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref></sup>. To test whether this is also the case in HNSCC, we orthotopically implanted MOC2-7 cells into the oral cavity of male wildtype mice. After 14 days, TGM neurons were harvested and analyzed by qPCR using a commercial array for neural transmission and membrane trafficking genes. Compared to control TGM (non-tumoral) neurons, ipsilateral TGM neurons from tumor-bearing animals harbored increased expression (&lt;4-fold) in genes involved in neuronal signaling/receptors (<italic>Gabrg1, Gabra4, Grin2c, Grm3</italic>) and synaptic transmission (<italic>Gria2</italic>) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref><bold>; Supplemental Table 1</bold>) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref></sup>. Of note, we purposefully used whole trigeminal ganglia rather than FACS-sorted tracer-positive dissociated neurons to avoid artificially imposing injury and altering the transcriptome of these cells <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref></sup>.</p>

<title>Tumor-infiltrating neurons are functionally changed</title>
<p>Given this transcriptomic alteration, we tested whether tumor-infiltrating neurons exhibit functional alterations. Thus, MOC2-7 tumor-bearing mice were intra-tumorally injected with the fluorophore-conjugated WGA tracer. Five days later, tracer<sup>+</sup> TGM ganglia were cultured, and responsiveness to noxious stimuli was analyzed by calcium microscopy. Neuronal Ca<sup>+</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup> responses to capsaicin (300 nM), which binds and activates TRPV1 channels, were measured by Fluo-4AM fluorescence microscopy. We found that tracer<sup>+</sup> tumor-infiltrating ipsilateral TGM neurons show increased responsiveness to capsaicin compared to tracer negative contralateral neurons (amplitude, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B-D</xref>; the area under the curve, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref>). Similar to contralateral TGM neurons, non-tumor-bearing TGM neurons elicited a normal response to capsaicin (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2F</xref>).</p>
<p>This heightened sensitivity could reflect increased TRPV1 expression and/or its phosphorylation. We tested whether this was the case using western blotting and discovered an overexpression of the sigma 1 receptor (σ1R) and increased TRPV1 phosphorylation in the TGM ganglia from tumor-bearing animals (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2G-I</xref>, full westerns <bold>Supplemental Fig 2A-C</bold>). Of note, the σ1R is an endoplasmic reticulum chaperone protein that directly interacts with TRPV1 and regulates its membrane expression, <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref></sup> while protein kinase C phosphorylation of serine 502 and 800 of TRPV1 reduces the receptor’s activation threshold <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref></sup>. Taken together, our data indicate that HNSCC-infiltrating nerves have a unique transcriptome and a heightened sensitivity to noxious stimuli characterized by an increased TRPV1 expression and phosphorylation consistent with TRPV1 sensitization secondary to oral cancer <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref></sup>.</p>

To test whether this is the case, we genetically engineered mice with ablated nociceptor neurons (TRPV1<sup>cre</sup>::DTA<sup>fl/wt</sup>). TRPV1<sup>cre</sup>::DTA<sup>fl/wt</sup> animals lack TRPV1-expressing cells (including neurons) as well as many other nociceptive neurons.

<title>Alleviation of pain does not always restore behavior</title>
<p>To evaluate the effects of this disruption on cancer-induced behavioral changes, we assessed the animals’ general well-being through nesting behavior <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup> and anhedonia using the cookie test <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">76</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">77</xref></sup>, as well as body weight and the speed of food disappearance as a surrogate for oral pain. Nociceptor neuron ablated mice showed increased nesting performance (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E</xref>) and decreased anhedonia (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4F</xref>) compared to intact mice. This was accompanied by smaller tumor growth (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4G</xref>) and increased survival (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4H</xref>). While both groups showed similar body weight loss (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4I</xref>), nociceptor ablated animals show a transient (Wk 1, 4, 5) decrease in food disappearance (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4J</xref>). Significant effects for all statistical analyses in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref> are presented in Supplementary Table 2.</p>
<p>The developmental ablation of TRPV1 neurons can lead to unintended effects on tumor innervation and behavior. Thus, we chemoablated TRVP1 neurons in 4-week-old juvenile C57BL/6 mice using resiniferatoxin (RTX) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>. We examined nesting behavior in RTX and vehicle-treated C57BL/6 male mice orthotopically implanted with MOC2-7 cells. An additional control group consisted of age-matched C57BL/6 mice without tumors. Although all groups displayed similar nesting scores initially, the scores in vehicle-treated mice declined significantly faster compared to RTX-treated mice (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5A</xref>). Body weight decreased in all tumor-bearing mice, but the extent of weight loss was similar between vehicle and RTX-treated mice (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5B</xref>). Similar to the developmental ablation of TRPV1 neurons, their chemoablation post-development results in a similar decrease in tumor growth compared to controls (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5C</xref>).Since HNSCC tumors cause oral pain and both nesting and the cookie test require the use of the mouth, we also evaluated the effect of nociceptor ablation on voluntary wheel running to gain additional insights into cancer-associated fatigue, a surrogate for depressive-like behaviors in tumor-bearing mice <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">78</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">82</xref></sup>. To assess the potential influence of cancer-associated pain, 1-week post tumor inoculation, groups of mice were treated with carprofen (a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory), extended-release buprenorphine (opioid), or vehicle. We found that wheel running decreased as tumors progressed, an effect partially alleviated by carprofen and buprenorphine (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6A,B</xref>). The nesting behavior (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6C</xref>), body weight (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6D</xref>), and food disappearance (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6E</xref>) were also alleviated by the painkillers. Neither carprofen nor buprenorphine impacted MOC2-7 tumor growth compared to vehicle-treated animals (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6F</xref>), but buprenorphine increased tumor growth compared to carprofen-treated mice (significant effects for all statistical analyses in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref> are presented in Supplementary Table 3). These findings suggest that choosing pain management drugs in the context of cancer can potentially influence tumor growth adversely. Furthermore, the data reveals that behaviors associated with the tumor site are adversely affected by cancer-associated pain. However, merely alleviating pain does not fully restore all behaviors, as evidenced by persistent issues in activities like wheel running.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We have previously demonstrated that head and neck squamous cell carcinoma is associated with innervation by sensory neurons and that substance P, one of the principal neuropeptides these fibers release, drives malignant cell proliferation and migration <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>. Significantly, patients suffering from HNSCC often experience depressive disorders, which are poorly managed clinically <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">83</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">85</xref></sup>. Here, we now found that nociceptor neurons infiltrating HNSCC connect to a pre-existing brain-projecting circuit <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">86</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">87</xref></sup> that includes the trigeminal ganglia, the spinal nucleus of the trigeminal (SpVc), as well as the parabrachial nucleus (PBN), and central amygdala (CeA). This connection occurs independently of pain, and this cancer-brain circuit drives behavioral alterations in tumor-bearing mice. While the elimination of TRPV1-expressing nociceptor neurons reduces tumor growth and enhances survival rates, it also highlights a potential therapeutic target for mitigating depressive behaviors in cancer patients. This underscores the complex interplay between sensory neurons, cancer progression, and mental health, uncovering a two-pronged approach to improving HNSCC patients’ physical and psychological health.</p>
<p>In melanoma <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref></sup> and HNSCC, we demonstrated significant transcriptional alterations within tumor-infiltrating nerves. Several mechanisms can account for these changes. For instance, TRPV1 stimulation is sufficient to trigger the activation of the AP-1 transcription factor within neurons <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">88</xref></sup>. Such TRPV1 activation could occur in response to low pH <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">89</xref></sup> or hypoxia <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">90</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c92">92</xref></sup>, which are both prevalent within the tumor microenvironment. Alternatively, we previously demonstrated that tumor-released sEVs, which transport microRNAs (miRNAs), induced sprouting of loco-regional nerves to the tumor bed <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93">93</xref></sup>. These sEV-transported miRNAs could also modulate various neuronal transcription factors and, in turn, drive the transcriptomic changes we observed in these neurons.</p>
<p>Our data indicate that these peripheral neuronal changes also influence the functioning of the brain areas to which they connect. Although we did not make the complete cartography of all brain regions utilized by tumor-infiltrating nerves, we identified a few critical nuclei. Subsequent work will use emerging circuit mapping techniques for whole brain profiling <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c94">94</xref></sup>. Nevertheless, our tracing in tumor-bearing nociceptor neuron ablated, and intact animals was sufficient to functionally implicate TRPV1-expressing neurons in this communication.</p>
<p>Trigeminal ganglia neurons are composed of ∼80% of Na<sub>V</sub>1.8<sup>+</sup> nociceptor neurons, with one-half being peptidergic (TRPV1<sup>+</sup>, TRPA1<sup>+</sup>) neurons <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">75</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c95">95</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c96">96</xref></sup>. In the TRPV1<sup>cre</sup>::DTA<sup>fl/wt</sup> mouse, these peptidergic neurons are eliminated, leaving intact ∼50% of pain-sensing neurons. The remaining presence of these non-peptidergic, largely MrgD<sup>+</sup>, neurons might explain why nesting behavior in TRPV1<sup>cre</sup>::DTA<sup>fl/wt</sup> tumor-bearing animals is only partially restored.</p>
<p>Inflammation contributes to pain in cancer <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c97">97</xref></sup>. Consistent with this, treatment of tumor-bearing mice with analgesic drugs (carprofen, buprenorphine) resulted in complete restoration of nest building and performance in the cookie test. These data show that the constraint imposed by the tumor on behavioral activities that require the use of the oral cavity is mainly due to pain and not to the physical interference of the tumor mass with the pattern of oral activities that need to take place for mice to perform the corresponding behavior.</p>
<p>Cancer pain often interferes with activities that don’t involve oral movements, a phenomenon evident in the impaired voluntary wheel running observed in tumor-bearing mice. Although analgesic drugs can partially mitigate this deficit, they fail to restore this behavior fully, despite their efficacy in completely restoring oral activity behaviors like nesting and the cookie test. This suggests that factors beyond pain contribute to the observed behavioral changes. These alterations could be attributed to depression <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c98">98</xref></sup> or represent a competition between the energy demands of the HNSCC malignant cells and the host’s skeletal muscles <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c99">99</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c101">101</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Our current findings suggest that interrupting tumor-to-brain communication can mitigate the mental health decline often associated with cancer. Yet, a higher prevalence of depression persists among long-term cancer survivors compared to individuals without a cancer history. Having received treatment and showing no evidence of disease, these survivors continue to battle mental health issues <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. This phenomenon prompts a critical question - why does this discrepancy exist? It is conceivable that these patients, through treatments like surgery, radiation, or chemotherapy, have disrupted the tumor-brain connection and have sustained this disconnection over the years. However, unlike animal models, their mental health decline is not reversed. Several speculations, grounded in known factors, can be considered.</p>
<p>The human experience with cancer is distinct from that of mouse models; individuals can live with malignant growths for extended periods, often unaware of their existence due to asymptomatic or nonspecific symptoms. During this undiagnosed period, the tumor-brain circuit might induce irreversible changes in central neurons through activity-dependent transcriptional modifications <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c102">102</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c103">103</xref></sup>. These alterations, anchored in neuronal plasticity, adaptation, and behavior, may become permanent even after the cancer is diagnosed and treated.</p>
<p>Moving forward, to reverse these entrenched brain changes, understanding the specific transcriptional alterations incurred by central neurons is vital. Unraveling this complexity could pave the way for therapies that reverse the neuronal activity impacts, fostering improved mental health. Although in its early stages, our insight into the role of nerves in cancer is growing, and highlighting neuronal targets for pharmacological interventions.</p>
<p>Our study is not exempt from limitations. First, our exploration of the tumor-to-brain pathway was confined to mice with HNSCC and utilized a single cancer cell line. Hence, the universality of our conclusions warrants verification through additional HNSCC cell lines and diverse cancer models. Furthermore, the exclusive focus on HNSCC, particularly considering the nerve-rich oral region, raises questions about the pathway’s establishment and behavioral impact in other contexts. Our behavioral assessment was not exhaustive; a comprehensive analysis of nerve-dependent and independent behaviors remains forthcoming. Behaviors could also be influenced by elements like soluble factors or the energy competition between the tumor and behavioral activities. Our studies have also solely involved male mice, presenting a clear gap in understanding the potential sex differences in the development of the tumor-to-brain communication pathway and its subsequent influence on behavior. The inclusion of female subjects in future research is essential to provide a comprehensive insight into these processes.</p>
<p>Second, our nerve tracing methodology, where we injected 2 µl of WGA into the tumor bed, is designed to label only the tumor-infiltrating nerves and their connections. However, this approach fails to label <italic>all</italic> tumor-infiltrating nerves, predominantly those not close to the WGA-injected region and nerves that are in contact with or influenced by the tumor but are not directly infiltrating it. This limitation is a calculated one, reflecting a technical trade-off. We aimed to ensure the specificity of capturing only tumor-infiltrating nerves, which meant sacrificing the comprehensiveness of labeling all nerves associated with the tumor. This constraint extends to our calcium imaging studies and brain tracing. Although we can confidently assert that all labeled neurons are indeed tumor-infiltrating or connected, we cannot conclusively state that all tracer-negative ipsilateral nerves are unconnected to the tumor-brain circuit.</p>
<p>Even with these constraints, our findings are important. We have demonstrated that tumor-infiltrating nerves are integrated into a pre-established neuronal circuit. This circuit extends from the tumor bed to the TGM ganglion, connects to the SpVc, and projects into the brain, influencing behavior in both pain-dependent and independent ways. This revelation paves the way for in-depth exploration into the mechanistic underpinnings of cancer-associated alterations in well-being and mental health, shedding light on potential therapeutic interventions to alleviate these profound effects.</p>

<title>Animal studies</title>
<p>All animal experiments were performed in the Sanford Research Animal Resource Center which is a specific pathogen free facility. All mice were maintained in IVC Tecniplast Green line Seal Safe Plus cages which were opened only under aseptic conditions in an animal transfer station. All cages were changed every other week using aseptic technique. All cages had individual HEPA filtered air. Animal rooms were maintained at 75<sup>°</sup>F, 30-70% humidity, with a minimum of 15 air changes per hour, and a 14:10 light/dark cycle. Corncob bedding, which was autoclaved prior to use, was maintained in all cages. Irradiated, sterile food (Envigo) and acidified water (pH 2.8-3.0) were available <italic>ad libitum</italic>. There was a maximum of 5 mice/cage. All animals were observed daily for abnormal behavior, signs of illness or distress, the availability of food and water and proper husbandry. Animals injected with murine tumor cells were 10-week-old C57BL/6 or TRPV1<sup>cre</sup>::DTA<sup>fl/wt</sup>mice (The Jackson Laboratory) weighing approximately 24 gm. Investigators were blinded to the groups when assessing animals (e.g., measuring tumors). Animals were numbered by ear punch and cage number.</p>
<p>Nociceptor neuron ablated TRPV1<sup>cre</sup>::DTA<sup>fl/wt</sup> animals were generated by crossing ROSA26-DTA (diphtheria toxin A, B6.129P2-<italic>Gt(ROSA)26Sor <sup>tm1(DTA)Lky</sup></italic>/J) and TRPV1-Cre (B6.129-<italic>Trpv1<sup>tm1(cre)Bbm</sup></italic>/J) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup> mice; the progeny (TRPV1<sup>cre</sup>::DTA<sup>fl/wt</sup>) express DTA (diphtheria toxin fragment A) under control of the TRPV1 promoter, thereby genetically ablating all TRPV1 expressing cells (including TRPV1-expressing neurons) throughout development. Absence of TRPV1-expressing sensory neurons was validated by IHC staining of TGM ganglia for TRPV1. Chemoablation of TRPV1-expressing neurons post-development was accomplished with resiniferatoxin (RTX), a naturally occurring potent TRPV1 agonist. RTX treatment results in the specific ablation of TRPV1 neurons (post-development), while sparing other TRPV1 expressing (non-neuronal) cells. RTX treatment in mice consisted of three injections of RTX given 24 hours apart. The injections are given in the flank and were: 30ug/kg on day 1, 70ug/kg on day 2 and 100ug/kg on day 3. Just prior to the first RTX injection, mice are treated with 0.1 mg/kg of buprenorphine, given intraperitoneally, as the first injection causes pain. Subsequent injections do not require buprenorphine. It takes 4 weeks for TRPV1 nerve ablation to occur. Control mice received injections with vehicle solution (DMSO with Tween80 in PBS). The tail flick test was used to confirm nerve ablation.</p>

<sec id="s4e">
<title>Tail flick test</title>
<p>Prior to testing, mice are acclimated to the room for 30 minutes. A water bath is pre-warmed to 52֯C and a thermometer is used to constantly monitor the temperature of the water. The mice are picked up using a fresh paper towel so that only their tail is outside the paper towel. Once the mouse is relaxed in the tester’s hand, the mouse’s tail is lowered into the water so that a quarter of the tail is submerged. The time for the tail to be flicked out of the water is recorded. If no response has occurred by 20 seconds, the mouse’s tail is removed from the water to prevent tissue damage. A response time latency greater than 10 seconds signifies denervation.</p>

<title>Tumor implantation</title>
<p>Ketamine (87.5 mg/kg)/xylazine (10 mg/kg) were used to anesthetize mice prior to oral cavity tumor implantation. Tumors were initiated as follows: using a 25-gauge needle, cells (5 x 10<sup>4</sup> cells in a total of 50 μl) were implanted orthotopically in the oral cavity of male C57BL/6 mice. Specifically, the needle was placed proximal to the crease of the mouse cheek, inserted at approximately a 45° angle, bevel deep, and tumor cells injected into this location of the cheek pouch. Mice were allowed to recover from anesthesia on a heating blanket and returned to their home cage. Control (non-tumor) mice were treated the same way only their injection contained media alone (no cells). Tumor growth was monitored weekly by caliper measurements of isoflurane anesthetized animals and tumor volume calculated was using the formula: ½ (length*(width^2)).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4g">
<title>Drug treatments</title>
<p>Carprofen (Pivetal) was provided in the drinking water (10mg/kg which is equivalent to 0.067 mg/ml) which was refreshed every 7 days. Buprenorphine-ER (Fidelis Animal Health), a 72-hour extended-release formulation, was given by subcutaneous injection (3.25 mg/kg) every 72 hours. Vehicle-treated animals were treated with subcutaneous injection of saline. Drug treatments commenced on day 7 post-tumor implantation in all groups. Given that buprenorphine treatment requires a subcutaneous injection every 3 days, mice in the other groups (vehicle and carprofen) received a subcutaneous injection of saline at the same volume (60 µl) as the buprenorphine-treated animals. In this way, all animal stress from handling and injection was the same.</p>

<title>Nest building</title>
<p>Nest building is an innate behavior performed in rodents of both sexes and is a general indication of well-being <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>; it also measures the motivation to perform a goal-directed task. To assess nesting behavior, individually housed mice were given a nesting square (Ancare) overnight. The following morning, nests were scored by two independent scorers who were blinded to the conditions <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>. The scoring system is 0-4 and based on the percentage of the nestlet that is shredded and the height of the nest. Two baseline measurements were conducted prior to tumor implantation followed by weekly testing. Exclusion criteria of an average baseline score of 3 or greater was used to ensure all mice were good nest builders at baseline (n=3 C57BL/6 mice and n=7 TRPV1<sup>cre</sup>::DTA<sup>fl/wt</sup> mice were excluded for this reason).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4i">
<title>Cookie test</title>
<p>The cookie test is a variation of the sucrose preference test, a test of anhedonia (the inability to experience enjoyment or interest in previously rewarding activities). These test the animal’s endogenous inclination for sweet tastes and the notion that it derives pleasure from consuming sweets. One hour prior to testing, the mice were fasted and acclimated to the brightly lit testing room. Following the acclimation period, mice were given a piece of cookie (approximately 1.5 gm). The time it took the mouse to bite the cookie from its placement in the cage was measured to determine time-to-interact. Each mouse was acclimated to the cookie every other day for 2 weeks prior to tumor implantation with a baseline measurement followed by weekly testing. Mice were individually housed. One mouse from the C57BL/6 group was excluded due to incomplete data (mouse died before completion of the study).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4j">
<title>Voluntary wheel running</title>
<p>Prior to tumor implantation, mice were singly housed with a running wheel maintained in the home cage continuously. The only time that the wheel was removed was when mice were undergoing nesting. The mice were acclimated to the wheel for 2 weeks prior to tumor implantation. This acclimatization period provided the time to stabilize their running performance. Running wheels were maintained in the home cage for the duration of the study. As mice are most active during the dark phase, nighttime running (8pm to 8am) was assessed. Running data were collected in 1-minute bins continuously throughout the duration of the experiment.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4k">
<title>Food disappearance</title>
<p>Animals were provided 100 g of solid food per cage each week. At the end of each week, the remaining food was weighed, and this value was used to calculate the amount of food that disappeared in that week per cage. For all behavioral experiments, mice were singly housed.</p>

<title>Neural tracing of orthotopic HNSCC tumors</title>
<p>When oral tumors reached approximately 5 x 5 mm in size, neural tracer was injected into the tumor as described below. Ketamine (87.5 mg/kg)/xylazine (10 mg/kg) were used to anesthetize the mice. A 10 µL Hamilton syringe with 30-G needle was loaded with 1% Wheat Germ Agglutinin (WGA) conjugated to either AlexaFluor 594 (Invitrogen) or CF568 (Biotium) in PBS and 2μl was slowly injected intra-tumorally with the bevel side up. The needle was inserted approximately midway through the tumor then pulled back slightly to reduce pressure and leakage of tracer following injection. The injection of tracer occurred slowly over the course of 10 minutes. After the tracer was injected, the needle was kept in place for 2 additional minutes before being slowly removed. Mice were placed on a heating pad until recovery from anesthesia. Five to seven days later, mice were deeply anesthetized and transcardially perfused with ice cold PBS followed by 4% paraformaldehyde and trigeminal ganglia (TGM) were carefully removed and placed in HBSS in a 24-well plate kept on ice. TGM harvesting was completed as follows: euthanized animals were subjected to a midline incision while in the prone position to expose the crown of the skull. The brainstem was separated from the spinal cord by a transverse cut and the top of the skull was removed, exposing the brainstem and TGM. All tissues (tumor, ganglia and brain) were fixed, sectioned, and imaged for WGA labeled nerve fibers and somas under confocal microscopy. WGA injection into control (non-tumor bearing animals) was performed the same way and injection was into the same oral region where tumors were implanted. Volumes of 2 or 10 μl of WGA were used.</p>

<title>Immunohistochemical (IHC) staining</title>
<p>Tissues were formalin fixed, paraffin-embedded and cut into 5 µm sections. The BenchMark® XT automated slide staining system (Ventana Medical Systems, Inc.) was used to optimize antibody dilutions and staining. The Ventana CC1 solution was used to perform the antigen retrieval step (basic pH tris base buffer). Tissues were incubated in primary antibody for 1 hour. The Ventana iView DAB detection kit was used as the chromogen and the slides were counterstained with hematoxylin.</p>

<title>Brain immunostaining and analysis</title>
<p>Brains were post-fixed for twenty-four hours. Coronal or sagittal sections were cut at 40 µm using a vibratome. Sequential fluorescent immunolabeling was performed for cFos or ΔFosB on free-floating sections. All sections were blocked with 10% goat serum in 0.3% Tx-100. All antibodies were diluted in PBS containing 0.03% Triton X-100 and 2% normal goat serum. Sections were incubated in Fos antibody for 72 hours. Following washes in 0.1M phosphate buffered saline, sections were incubated in secondary antibody for 3 hours. Following additional washes, sections were mounted onto glass slides, and cover slipped with cytoseal prior to imaging. The total numbers of cFos or ΔFosB-labeled nuclei were counted on 10 × 2D images acquired using a laser-scanning confocal microscope (Nikon A1R) and verified as positive if the signal filled the nucleus and stood out clearly compared to surrounding tissue <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>. Nuclei were counterstained with DAPI. Quantification of Fos-labeled cells was performed using digital thresholding of Fos-immunoreactive nuclei. The threshold for detection was set at a level where dark Fos-immunoreactive nuclei were counted, but nuclei with light labeling, similar to background staining, were not. For each animal, 3-4 sections were selected at 120 μm intervals. ImageJ cell counter (v. 1.52) was used to quantify Fos+ nuclei per region / section.</p>

<title>Analysis of transcriptional changes in tumor-infiltrating neurons</title>
<p>To assess transcriptional changes in tumor-infiltrating neurons we utilize a qPCR array (ScienCell, GeneQuery Neural Transmission and Membrane Trafficking, #MGK008). These qPCR-ready 96 well plates enable rapid profiling of 88 key genes important for neuronal functions (listed in Table S1). Mice bearing MOC2-7 oral tumors were injected with tracer (as described above); TGM ganglia were isolated on day 28 post-tumor implantation, their RNA harvested, converted into cDNA and then assayed with the array as per manufacturer’s instructions (ScienCell, GeneQuery arrays). We utilized N=4 TGM/group from n=4 mice/group; n=4 plates/condition. Control RNA was isolated from TGM ganglia from age-matched non-tumor bearing mice (n=4 mice). Relative gene expression was calculated as per manufacturer’s recommendations.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Using a mouse model of head and neck cancer, Barr et al show that tumor-infiltrating nerves connect to brain regions via the ipsilateral trigeminal ganglion, and they demonstrate the effect this has on behavior. The authors show that there are neurites surrounding the tumors using a WGA assay and show that the brain regions that are involved in this tumor-containing circuit have elevated Fos and FosB expression and increased calcium response. Behaviorally, tumor-bearing mice have decreased nest building and wheel running and increased anhedonia. The behavior, Fos expression, and heightened calcium activity were all decreased in tumor-bearing mice following nociceptor neuron elimination.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This paper establishes that sensory neurons innervate head and neck cancers and that these tumors impact select brain areas. This paper also establishes that behavior is altered following these tumors and that drugs to treat pain restore some but not all of the behavior. The results from the experiments (predominantly gene and protein expression assays, cFos expression, and calcium imaging) support their behavioral findings both with and without drug treatment.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Study suggests that the effects of their tumor models of mouse behavioral are largely non-specific to the tumor as most behaviors are rescued by analgesic treatment. So, most of the changes were likely due to site-specific pain and not a unique signal from the tumor.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Cancer treatments are not just about the tumor - there is an ever-increasing need for treating pain, fatigue, and anhedonia resulting from the disease as patients are undergoing successful but prolonged bouts with cancer. Using an implantable oral tumor model in the mouse, Barr et al describe neural infiltration of tumors, and posit that these nerve fibers are transmitting pain and other sensory signals to the brain that reduce pleasure and motivation. These findings are in part supported by anatomical and transcriptional changes in the tumor that suggest sensory innervation, neural tracing, and neural activity measurements. Further, the authors conduct behavior assays in tumor-bearing animals and inhibit/ablate pain sensory neurons to suggest the involvement of local sensory innervation of tumors in mediating cancer-induced malaise.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>• This is an important area of research that may have implications for improving the quality of life of cancer patients.</p>
<p>• The studies use a combination of approaches (tracing and anatomy, transcriptional, neural activity recordings, behavior assays, loss-of-function) to support their claims.</p>
<p>• Tracing experiments suggest that tumor-innervating afferents are connected to brain nuclei involved in oral pain sensing. Consistent with this, the authors observed increased neural activity in those brain areas of tumor-bearing animals. It should be noted that some of these brain nuclei have also been implicated in cancer-induced behavioral alterations in non-head and neck tumor models.</p>
<p>• Experiments are for the most part well-controlled, and approaches are validated.</p>
<p>• The paper is well-written and the layout was easy to follow.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>• The main claim is that tumor-infiltrating nerves underlie cancer-induced behavioral alterations, but the experimental interventions are not specific enough to support this. For example, all TRPV1 neurons, including those innervating the skin and internal organs, are ablated to examine sensory innervation of the tumor. Within the context of cancer, behavioral changes may be due to systemic inflammation, which may alter TRPV1 afferents outside the local proximity of tumor cells. A direct test of the claims of this paper would be to selectively inhibit/ablate nerve fibers innervating the tumor or mouth region.</p>
<p>• Behavioral results from TRPV1 neuron ablation studies are in part confounded by differing tumor sizes in ablated versus control mice. Are the differences in behavior potentially explained by the ablated animals having significantly smaller tumors? The differences in tumor sizes are not negligible. One way to examine this possibility might be to correlate behavioral outcomes with tumor size.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors have tested for and demonstrated a physical (i.e., sensory nerves to the brain) connection between tumors and parts of the brain. This can explain why there is an increase in depressive disorders in HNSCC patients. While connections such as this have been suspected, this is a novel demonstration pointing to sensory neurons that is accompanied by a remarkable amount of complementary data.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>There is substantial evidence provided for the hypotheses tested. The data are largely quite convincing.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The authors mention in their Discussion the need for additional experiments. Could they also include / comment on the potential impact on the anti-tumor immune system in their model?</p>
<p>Minor:</p>
<p>The authors mention the importance of inflammation contributing to pain in cancer but do not clearly highlight how this may play a role in their model. Can this be clarified?</p>
<p>The tumor model apparently requires isoflurane injection prior to tumor growth measurements. This is different from most other transplantable types of tumors used in the literature. Was this treatment also given to control (i.e., non-tumor) mice at the same time points? If not, can the authors comment on the impact of isoflurane (if any) in their model?</p>
<p>The authors emphasize in several places that this is a male mouse model. They mention this as a limitation in the Discussion. Was there an original reason why they only tested male mice?</p>
