<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Spectrins are membrane cytoskeletal proteins generally thought to function as heterotetramers comprising two α-spectrins and two β-spectrins. They influence cell shape and Hippo signaling, but the mechanism by which they influence Hippo signaling has remained unclear. We have investigated the role and regulation of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> β-heavy Spectrin (β<sub>H</sub>-Spectrin, encoded by the <italic>karst</italic> gene) in wing imaginal discs. Our results establish that β<sub>H</sub>-Spectrin regulates Hippo signaling through the Jub biomechanical pathway due to its influence on cytoskeletal tension. While we find that α-Spectrin also regulates Hippo signaling through Jub, unexpectedly, we find that β<sub>H</sub>-Spectrin localizes and functions independently of α-Spectrin. Instead, β<sub>H</sub>-Spectrin co-localizes with and reciprocally regulates and is regulated by myosin. In vivo and in vitro experiments support a model in which β<sub>H</sub>-Spectrin and myosin directly compete for binding to apical F-actin. This competition can explain the influence of β<sub>H</sub>-Spectrin on cytoskeletal tension and myosin accumulation. It also provides new insight into how β<sub>H</sub>-Spectrin participates in ratcheting mechanisms associated with cell shape change.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The spectrin cytoskeleton has been described as a lattice of cross-linked, spring-like proteins that provide structural support to cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Liem, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Machnicka et al., 2014</xref>). Spectrins were first discovered and characterized in red blood cells but are expressed in many cell types. Spectrins can bind to cell membranes and F-actin, linking them together. They are generally thought to act as heterotetramers, composed of two α subunits and two β subunits. <italic>Drosophila</italic> has one α-spectrin (α-Spec) and two β-spectrins: β-Spectrin (β-Spec) and β-Heavy-Spectrin (β<sub>H</sub>-Spec, encoded by <italic>karst</italic> (<italic>kst</italic>)), which could potentially generate two distinct spectrin heterotetramers: (αβ)<sub>2</sub> and (αβ<sub>H</sub>)<sub>2</sub>. β-Spec and β<sub>H</sub>-Spec interact with F-actin through their N-terminal domains, which contain two actin-binding calponin-homology (CH) domains, connecting the spectrin cytoskeleton to the actin cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Liem, 2016</xref>). In <italic>Drosophila</italic> epithelia, it has been reported that β-Spec localizes to the lateral sides of cells, β<sub>H</sub>-Spec localizes to the apical sides of cells, and α-Spec localizes both laterally and apically, leading to inferences that spectrin exists as lateral (αβ)<sub>2</sub> tetramers and apical (αβ<sub>H</sub>)<sub>2</sub> tetramers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Dubreuil et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Lee et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Thomas et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Zarnescu and Thomas, 1999</xref>). Despite common assumptions that spectrins act as tetramers, there is some evidence that alternative arrangements may exist. In <italic>Drosophila</italic> ovarian follicle cells, the absence of α-Spec diminishes the recruitment of β<sub>H</sub>-Spec to the apical domain, but it does not affect the recruitment of β-Spec to the lateral domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Lee <italic>et al</italic>., 1997</xref>). Examination in <italic>Drosophila</italic> of a mutant form of α-Spec that, based on in vitro studies, is unable to bind β-spec and compromised in its ability to bind β<sub>H</sub>-Spec, revealed that it could nonetheless rescue the lethality of an <italic>α-Spec</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Khanna et al., 2015</xref>). Experiments done with a mammalian homolog of β<sub>H</sub>-Spec, βV-Spec, showed that it can homodimerize through its C-terminal region, raising the possibility that βV-Spec might be able to cross-link F-actin by itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Papal et al., 2013</xref>).</p>
<p>Several studies have reported that spectrins also regulate Hippo signaling, with effects on cell proliferation and readouts of Hippo signaling reported in <italic>Drosophila</italic> imaginal discs and ovarian follicles, as well as in cultured mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Deng et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Deng et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Fletcher et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Wong et al., 2015</xref>). Hippo signaling is a signal transduction network that responds to diverse upstream inputs, including the cytoskeleton and cells’ physical environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Misra and Irvine, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Zheng and Pan, 2019</xref>). Hippo signaling largely modulates cell proliferation and fate through the regulation of Yap family transcriptional co-activator proteins (Yorkie, Yki, in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, YAP1 and TAZ in humans). Yki is primarily regulated through phosphorylation by the kinase Warts (Wts), which promotes the cytoplasmic localization of Yki. Various potential mechanisms for biomechanical regulation of Yki/Yap activity have been described, but the best-characterized mechanism in <italic>Drosophila</italic> is the Jub biomechanical pathway. This involves tension-dependent recruitment of an Ajuba LIM protein (Jub in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, LIMD1 in mammals) to α-catenin at adherens junctions (AJ) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Alegot et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Ibar et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Rauskolb et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Rauskolb et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Sarpal et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Sun et al., 2015</xref>). Jub then recruits and inhibits Wts, resulting in increased Yki activity.</p>
<p>Studies of the influence of spectrins on Hippo signaling have suggested different mechanisms by which this might occur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Deng <italic>et al</italic>., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Deng <italic>et al</italic>., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Fletcher <italic>et al</italic>., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Wong <italic>et al</italic>., 2015</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Fletcher <italic>et al</italic>. (2015)</xref>, focusing on β<sub>H</sub>-Spec, suggested that the spectrin cytoskeleton influences the membrane density, and thereby the activation state, of upstream regulators of Hippo signaling. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Wong <italic>et al</italic>. (2015)</xref>, focusing on β-Spec, suggested that spectrins might influence Hippo signaling by modulating levels of F-actin; increased levels of F-actin have been reported in other studies to be associated with increased Yki/Yap activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Aragona et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Fernandez et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Sansores-Garcia et al., 2011</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Deng <italic>et al</italic>. (2015)</xref>, focusing on α-Spec, reported that spectrins regulate levels of phosphorylated myosin light chain (required for myosin activation) but surprisingly did not affect levels of myosin or recruitment of Jub, leading them to infer that spectrins can act through a novel tension-dependent but Jub-independent pathway. These same authors later reported that in the pupal eye, spectrins can act through Jub, while suggesting that the action of spectrins in the pupal eye differs from their action in the wing disc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Deng <italic>et al</italic>., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Deng <italic>et al</italic>., 2020</xref>).</p>
<p>The disparate models for how spectrins influence Hippo signaling have led to confusion over whether a distinct spectrin-based mechanism exists for the mechanical regulation of Hippo signaling. We were particularly interested in investigating claims that spectrins could alter cytoskeletal tension in wing discs without affecting Jub localization or levels of myosin. Our results reveal that both β<sub>H</sub>-Spec and α-Spec influence Jub recruitment to AJ, and their effects on Yki activity depend upon Jub. Together, these observations argue that spectrins influence Hippo signaling through the Jub biomechanical pathway. Unexpectedly, our investigations also reveal that β<sub>H</sub>-Spec and α-Spec act separately in wing discs - they do not co-localize, nor do they influence each other’s localization. These observations argue that β<sub>H</sub>-Spec does not act as part of an (αβ<sub>H</sub>)<sub>2</sub> tetramer in the wing disc but rather exerts its functions independently of α-Spec. Finally, we establish that β<sub>H</sub>-Spec and myosin reciprocally antagonize each other’s apical localization in wing discs - myosin inhibits β<sub>H</sub>-Spec, and β<sub>H</sub>-Spec inhibits myosin. We further show that β<sub>H</sub>-Spec and myosin can compete in vitro for binding to F-actin. Together with structural modeling, our observations argue that β<sub>H</sub>-Spec and myosin compete for binding to F-actin in vivo. This competition could explain how β<sub>H</sub>-Spec influences myosin activity and further suggests a simple mechanism for the contribution of β<sub>H</sub>-Spec to ratcheting processes that alter cell shape via actomyosin contractility.</p>

<title>β<sub>H</sub>-spectrin regulates myosin activity and levels in wing imaginal discs</title>
<p>Prior studies have reported that mutation or RNAi-mediated knockdown of spectrins in wing and eye imaginal discs increased myosin activity, as visualized by staining for myosin light chain phosphorylated at activation sites (pMLC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Deng <italic>et al</italic>., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Forest et al., 2018</xref>). Surprisingly, it was also reported that levels of myosin co-localizing with F-actin were nonetheless unaffected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Deng <italic>et al</italic>., 2015</xref>), whereas changes in myosin activity generally correlate with changes in myosin accumulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Fernandez-Gonzalez et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Noll et al., 2017</xref>). To re-examine this, we analyzed wing imaginal discs in which the apical, β<sub>H</sub>-Spec <italic>kst</italic> was knocked down in posterior cells by expressing UAS-RNAi lines under <italic>en-Gal4</italic> control. This increased apical pMLC in posterior cells, where levels of β<sub>H</sub>-Spec were reduced (<xref rid="fig1_S1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1- figure supplement 1B</xref> and <xref rid="fig1_S1" ref-type="fig">D</xref>), consistent with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Deng <italic>et al</italic>., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Forest <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>). A difference in junctional tension between anterior (control) cells and posterior (β<sub>H</sub>-Spec RNAi) cells in our experiments was confirmed by measuring the recoil velocity of cell junctions after laser cutting, which demonstrated an increased tension in the β<sub>H</sub>-Spec depleted sides (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1I</xref>). To examine myosin protein levels, we employed a widely-used myosin light chain GFP fusion, Sqh:GFP. We found that depletion of β<sub>H</sub>-Spec led to increased levels of junctional myosin (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). To quantify these effects on Sqh:GFP levels, we made maps of Sqh:GFP intensity normalized against E-cad intensity. These are displayed on a red (high) to blue (low) heat map (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Pan et al., 2018</xref>) and calculated the ratio of intensities of the anterior (control) versus posterior (experimental) compartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Alegot <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E-H, J-K</xref>). This was further confirmed by using a distinct β<sub>H</sub>-Spec RNAi line (<italic>UAS-kstRNAi</italic><sup><italic>HMS00882</italic></sup>), which similarly increased myosin levels (<xref rid="fig1_S1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1- figure supplement 1E</xref>).</p>

<p>As earlier studies reporting no effect on myosin levels focused on mutation or knockdown of α-Spec (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Deng <italic>et al</italic>., 2015</xref>), we considered the possibility that knockdown of α- and β<sub>H</sub>-Spec might differ in their effects on apical myosin accumulation. However, we found that knockdown of α-Spec also caused an increased accumulation of apical myosin, as well as pMLC and junctional tension, similar to the effects of β<sub>H</sub>-Spec knockdown (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D, H, J, K</xref>; <xref rid="fig1_S1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1 - figure supplement 1C</xref> and <xref rid="fig1_S1" ref-type="fig">D</xref>). α-Spec and β<sub>H</sub>-Spec knockdown differed though in that the thickness of the wing disc epithelium was reduced by α-Spec knockdown, but not by β<sub>H</sub>-Spec knockdown (<xref rid="fig1_S2" ref-type="fig">Figure 1 - figure supplement 2</xref>).</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<title>β<sub>H</sub>-Spec regulates Hippo signaling through Jub</title>
<p>It was previously argued that spectrins do not influence Hippo signaling through the Jub biomechanical pathway in wing discs, in part based on an apparent lack of effect of <italic>α-Spec</italic> mutation or depletion on Jub localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Deng <italic>et al</italic>., 2015</xref>). However, multiple studies have consistently observed that Jub localization increases when tension at AJ is increased (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Forest <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Pan <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Rauskolb et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Rauskolb <italic>et al</italic>., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Razzell et al., 2018</xref>). Thus, we examined Jub localization under conditions of β<sub>H</sub>-Spec depletion. In wing imaginal discs, Jub accumulates in puncta that often occur near intercellular vertices, together with a lower-level, more even accumulation along the cell-cell junctions (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref rid="fig2_S1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2– figure supplement 1C</xref>). Jub is recruited by a tension-dependent conformational change of α-catenin, and Jub puncta are increased when cytoskeletal tension is higher. Consistent with this, examination of Jub:GFP confirmed that the increased junctional tension and myosin activity caused by β<sub>H</sub>-Spec depletion is associated with increased junctional recruitment of Jub (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B, F, I-J</xref> and <xref rid="fig2_S1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2-figure supplement 1D</xref>).</p>

<p>To assess the functional significance of increased Jub localization to AJ under β<sub>H</sub>-Spec knockdown conditions, we assayed the ability of RNAi-mediated <italic>jub</italic> knockdown to suppress β<sub>H</sub>-Spec RNAi phenotypes. Knockdown of β<sub>H</sub>-spec throughout the developing wing under <italic>nub-Gal4</italic> control increases wing size (wings were 116% and 119% of <italic>nub-Gal4 UAS-dcr2</italic> control size for the two different UAS-RNAi lines used) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A, C-D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">K</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Deng <italic>et al</italic>., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Fletcher <italic>et al</italic>., 2015</xref>). Knockdown of <italic>jub</italic> leads to smaller wings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Das Thakur et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Rauskolb et al., 2011</xref>). In animals with simultaneous RNAi knockdown of <italic>jub</italic> and <italic>kst</italic>, wing size is similar to that of <italic>jub</italic> RNAi wings (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B, E-F</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">K</xref>). The epistasis of <italic>jub</italic> to <italic>kst</italic> suggests that β<sub>H</sub>-Spec regulates wing size through its tension-dependent regulation of Jub.</p>

<p>To confirm that the relationship between Jub and β<sub>H</sub>-Spec revealed by analysis of adult wing size corresponds to changes in Hippo pathway activity, we analyzed the expression of a transcriptional reporter of <italic>ex, ex-lacZ</italic>, which is a direct target of Yki (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Hamaratoglu et al., 2006</xref>). Knockdown of β<sub>H</sub>-Spec in posterior compartments through the expression of UAS-<italic>kst</italic> RNAi under <italic>en-Gal4</italic> control caused a mild increase in <italic>ex-lacZ</italic> expression compared to the anterior compartment and to control posterior compartments (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3M</xref>). Knockdown of <italic>jub</italic> reduces <italic>exlacZ</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Das Thakur <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Rauskolb <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>). Simultaneous RNAi knockdown of <italic>jub</italic> and <italic>kst</italic> reduced <italic>ex-lacZ</italic> expression, similar to that in <italic>jub</italic> RNAi cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3N-O</xref>). The suppression of the influence of <italic>kst</italic> on Hippo signaling is again consistent with the inference that β<sub>H</sub>-Spec regulates Hippo signaling through the Jub biomechanical pathway.</p>
<p>As claims that spectrins act independently of Jub in wing discs were based primarily on analysis of α-Spec, we also examined the effect of α-Spec knockdown on Jub levels. When α-Spec was knocked down in posterior cells by <italic>en-Gal4</italic> driven RNAi, we observed that recruitment of Jub to cell junctions was increased (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D, H-J</xref>). Moreover, as for β<sub>H</sub>-Spec, we found that the increased wing size and <italic>ex-lacZ</italic> expression caused by knockdown of α-Spec were suppressed by knockdown of <italic>jub</italic> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3G, H, K</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">P-Q</xref>). Thus, as for β<sub>H</sub>-Spec, and as suggested for pupal eyes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Deng <italic>et al</italic>., 2020</xref>), our observations imply that α-Spec also regulates Hippo signaling through Jub in wing discs.</p>

<title>β<sub>H</sub>-Spec localizes independently from α-Spec in wing disc cells</title>
<p>Prior studies of spectrin function in imaginal discs have assumed that they function as heterotetramers, with an apical complex composed of (αβ<sub>H</sub>)<sub>2</sub> subunits and a lateral complex composed of (αβ)<sub>2</sub> subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Deng <italic>et al</italic>., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Deng <italic>et al</italic>., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Fletcher <italic>et al</italic>., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Thomas <italic>et al</italic>., 1998</xref>), as was originally suggested for ovarian follicle cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Lee <italic>et al</italic>., 1997</xref>). However, our examination of spectrin localization in wing imaginal discs suggested that the apical-most distributions of α-Spec and β<sub>H</sub>-Spec differ. To directly compare them, we used an antibody against α-Spec (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Dubreuil et al., 1987</xref>) and a fully functional genomic YFP-trap of β<sub>H</sub>-Spec (Kst:YFP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Lye et al., 2014</xref>). β<sub>H</sub>-Spec is localized, as reported previously, at the apicobasal level of the adherens junction in wing discs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Fletcher <italic>et al</italic>., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Forest <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">C</xref>). Conversely, α-Spec is enriched in a sub-apical region just below this, with slightly lower levels extending all along the lateral membrane (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">C</xref>). Only very low levels of α-Spec are detected in the apical plane where β<sub>H</sub>-Spec is detected, and their distributions in this plane appear to differ (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref> and <xref rid="fig4_S1" ref-type="fig">Figure 4 – figure supplement 1A</xref>).</p>

<p>To confirm that β<sub>H</sub>-Spec and α-Spec localize independently of each other in wing discs, we examined the consequences of depleting α-Spec, β-Spec, or β<sub>H</sub>-Spec on each other’s localization. For this, we used <italic>en-Gal4</italic> driven UAS-RNAi lines to knockdown one of the spectrin proteins, and then examined whether the localization of the others was affected. These experiments revealed, as expected, that β-Spec knockdown does not significantly affect β<sub>H</sub>-Spec localization (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>), but it does strongly reduce α-Spec localization (<xref rid="fig4_S1" ref-type="fig">Figure 4 – figure supplement 1C</xref>). α-Spec knockdown does not affect β<sub>H</sub>-Spec apical localization (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>) but slightly reduces β-Spec localization (<xref rid="fig4_S1" ref-type="fig">Figure 4 – figure supplement 1B</xref>). Finally, β<sub>H</sub>-Spec depletion does not affect α-Spec localization (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>). These observations suggest that while α-Spec needs β-Spec to localize to lateral membranes, the localization of β<sub>H</sub>-Spec and α-Spec are functionally independent. Together with the distinct localization of these proteins revealed by imaging, these observations argue against the existence of (αβ<sub>H</sub>)<sub>2</sub> complexes in wing imaginal discs.</p>

<title>β<sub>H</sub>-Spec and apical myosin antagonize each others’ localization to apical F-actin</title>
<p>The discovery that β<sub>H</sub>-Spec and α-Spec localize independently led us to consider what factors might influence the apical localization of β<sub>H</sub>-Spec. Intriguingly, the distribution of β<sub>H</sub>-Spec in wing disc cells appears very similar to the apical distribution of F-actin and myosin, and similarities between the localization of β<sub>H</sub>-Spec and myosin in <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos have been noted previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Krueger et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Thomas and Kiehart, 1994</xref>). To determine whether myosin and β<sub>H</sub>-Spec colocalize in wing discs, we imaged discs expressing GFP-tagged β<sub>H</sub>-Spec (Kst:GFP) and mCherry-tagged myosin light chain (Sqh:mCherry). This revealed extensive co-localization between these proteins in the apical region of wing disc epithelial cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">B</xref>). Quantitation of these images yielded a Pearson’s Correlation Coefficient score of 0.636 (for comparison, the Pearson’s Correlation Coefficient score between Kst:YFP and α-Spec is 0.18 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>)).</p>

<p>The extensive co-localization of β<sub>H</sub>-Spec and myosin prompted us to investigate the functional relationship between them further. As noted above, reduction of β<sub>H</sub>-Spec leads to increased apical myosin levels and activity. To investigate whether myosin reciprocally regulates β<sub>H</sub>-Spec, we expressed transgenes that modulate actomyosin contractility. RNAi-mediated knockdown of Rho kinase (Rok) reduces myosin activity by reducing phosphorylation of myosin light chain (MLC, encoded in <italic>Drosophila</italic> by <italic>spaghetti squash</italic> (<italic>sqh</italic>)). In wing discs, knockdown of <italic>Rok</italic> is also associated with reduced recruitment of myosin to apical junctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Rauskolb <italic>et al</italic>., 2014</xref>), consistent with the generally positive correlation between myosin activity and co-localization with F-actin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Fernandez-Gonzalez <italic>et al</italic>., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Noll <italic>et al</italic>., 2017</xref>). Conversely, examination of β<sub>H</sub>-Spec in wing disc cells expressing <italic>Rok</italic> RNAi revealed increased levels of β<sub>H</sub>-Spec along apical junctions (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>). To increase myosin activity, we expressed a constitutively activated, phosphomimetic form of myosin light chain, Sqh<sup>EE</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Winter et al., 2001</xref>). This increases the recruitment of myosin to AJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Rauskolb <italic>et al</italic>., 2014</xref>), but decreases the recruitment of β<sub>H</sub>-Spec to AJ, and a portion of β<sub>H</sub>-Spec instead appears in apical vesicles (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref>). To quantify these effects on β<sub>H</sub>-Spec levels, we made maps of β<sub>H</sub>-Spec intensity normalized against E-cad intensity, displayed on a red (high) to blue (low) heat map (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Pan <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>). Calculation of the ratio of intensities of the anterior (control) versus posterior (experimental) compartments further confirmed our observation that myosin antagonizes localization of β<sub>H</sub>-Spec to AJ (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5G-J</xref>). Thus, β<sub>H</sub>-Spec and myosin II localization to AJ are affected in opposite ways by changes in cytoskeletal tension.</p>
<p>The opposing effects of changes in myosin activity on myosin and β<sub>H</sub>-Spec localization, together with the observation that loss of β<sub>H</sub>-Spec leads to increased myosin activity and apical localization, raised the possibility that myosin and β<sub>H</sub>-Spec compete for localization to apical F-actin. To further investigate this possibility, we overexpressed β<sub>H</sub>-Spec using a CRISPR-activator (CRISPRa) approach. This involves the expression of a transcriptional activator fused to dCas9 under UAS control, which can then be recruited to a gene of interest using a single-guide RNA (sgRNA) targeted upstream of the transcription start site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Jia et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Jia et al., 2018</xref>). To verify the overexpression of β<sub>H</sub>-Spec, we employed it in flies with GFP-tagged β<sub>H</sub>-Spec at the endogenous locus (Kst:GFP). To avoid excessive cell death caused by Kst overexpression we expressed this construct under inducible conditions, using the temperature-sensitive Gal4 repressor Gal80<sup>ts</sup>. Both imaging and western blotting of wing discs confirmed that this CRISPRa approach effectively increased expression of Kst:GFP (<xref rid="fig1_S1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1 - figure supplemental 1G-H</xref>). Examination of myosin under β<sub>H</sub>-Spec overexpression conditions, using Sqh:GFP, revealed a substantial reduction of myosin localization to AJs (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C, G, J-K</xref>). Apical cell areas were also increased, consistent with a reduction of junctional tension (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). As an independent method to overexpress β<sub>H</sub>-Spec, we used a previously described EP-element insertion near <italic>kst</italic>, P[EPgy2]EY01010 (UAS-kst<sup>EP</sup>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Pogodalla et al., 2021</xref>). Over-expression of β<sub>H</sub>-Spec using UAS-kst<sup>EP</sup> under <italic>en-Gal4</italic> control also reduced myosin levels at AJ (<xref rid="fig1_S1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1 – figure supplemental 1F</xref>), although the effect appeared weaker than that induced by the CRISPRa approach. These results provide further evidence that β<sub>H</sub>-Spec antagonizes myosin recruitment to AJs and establish that this effect can be observed under both increased and decreased β<sub>H</sub>-Spec expression conditions.</p>
<p>Consistent with these reductions in apical myosin accumulation, β<sub>H</sub>-Spec overexpression also reduced junctional recruitment of Jub (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C, G, I-J</xref> and <xref rid="fig2_S1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2 – figure supplement 1B</xref>) and decreased wing size (wings were 92% and 89% of <italic>nub-Gal4 UAS-dcr2</italic> control size, for the two different overexpression constructs) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3I-K</xref>).</p>

<title>β<sub>H</sub>-Spec and myosin compete for binding to F-actin</title>
<p>The reciprocal antagonism between myosin and β<sub>H</sub>-Spec suggested that they could compete for binding to F-actin. β<sub>H</sub>-Spec contains two N-terminal actin-binding domains, CH1 and CH2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Liem, 2016</xref>), and myosin contains an actin-binding region in its motor domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Duan et al., 2018</xref>). While spectrins and myosin have been purified and characterized in vitro, we lack a mechanistic understanding of the interaction between β<sub>H</sub>-Spec and F-actin and how it might affect myosin binding. To address this, we conducted in vitro co-sedimentation assays with purified protein domains and F-actin. We found that the isolated <italic>Drosophila</italic> β<sub>H</sub>-Spec actin-binding region binds F-actin weakly (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>), in agreement with previous reports of F-actin binding by other spectrin CH1-CH2 domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Avery et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Duan <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>). Constitutively active <italic>Drosophila</italic> Myosin II (subfragment-1-like protein) binding to F-actin appears stronger than β<sub>H</sub>-Spec binding, as at the same concentration a greater fraction of Myosin II is bound to F-actin (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>). To investigate the antagonism between these proteins observed in vivo, we performed biochemical competition assays between the β<sub>H</sub>-Spec CH domains and myosin for binding to F-actin. F-actin was preincubated with an excess of β<sub>H</sub>-Spec CH domains to saturate binding sites on F-actin, and then increasing concentrations of myosin were added. We found that myosin can displace the actin-binding region of β<sub>H</sub>-Spec from F-actin by ∼50% at the highest myosin concentration that we could use (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>, bottom). Myosin binding to F-actin was unaffected by preincubation with β<sub>H</sub>-Spec CH domains (<xref rid="fig6_S1" ref-type="fig">Figure 6 – figure supplement 1A</xref>), likely due to myosin’s higher binding affinity for F-actin.</p>

<p>To gain a structural understanding of the antagonism between β<sub>H</sub>-Spec and myosin we built homology models of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> CH1-CH2 domain of β<sub>H</sub>-Spec and the myosin II motor domain and compared them with previous cryo-EM structures of the human actin-bound β-III-spectrin actin binding CH1 domain and actin-bound myosin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Avery <italic>et al</italic>., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">von der Ecken et al., 2016</xref>). The superimposition of the isolated <italic>Drosophila</italic> β<sub>H</sub>-Spec CH1 domain model on the human β-III spectrin CH1 domain in a complex with F-actin structure revealed a binding site between actin subdomains (SD) SD1 and SD2 along the filament (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D</xref>). The binding region of myosin on F-actin includes SD1, SD2, and SD3 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D</xref>). The superimposition of both models suggests that the binding position of the CH1 domain on F-actin sterically interferes with the formation of a strong actin-myosin interface (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D</xref>’’). Modeling of the β<sub>H</sub>-Spec CH1-CH2 domain indicates that the CH2 domain presents additional steric hindrance for myosin binding to F-actin (<xref rid="fig6_S1" ref-type="fig">Figure 6 – figure supplement 1B-B</xref>’’). Thus, structural modeling suggests that the binding of spectrin or myosin to individual binding sites on F-actin is mutually exclusive, which could explain why they compete with each other for F-actin association in vivo and in vitro.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Multiple models for how spectrins regulate Hippo signaling have been proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Deng <italic>et al</italic>., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Deng <italic>et al</italic>., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Fletcher <italic>et al</italic>., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Wong <italic>et al</italic>., 2015</xref>). We focused on investigating claims that spectrins could alter cytoskeletal tension in wing discs by regulating pMLC levels without affecting localization of myosin or Jub (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Deng <italic>et al</italic>., 2015</xref>). In contrast to prior studies, we observed that when β<sub>H</sub>-Spec or α-Spec levels are decreased by RNAi, levels of junctional myosin are increased. This increase in junctional myosin levels is associated with increased junctional tension and with increased recruitment of Jub to AJ. We are not certain why these effects were missed in prior studies, but we note that our observations are consistent with studies linking recruitment of both myosin and Jub to AJ under tension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Alegot <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Fernandez-Gonzalez <italic>et al</italic>., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Ibar <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Noll <italic>et al</italic>., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Rauskolb <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Rauskolb <italic>et al</italic>., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Razzell <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Sarpal <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>). Moreover, our results are further supported by the observation that <italic>jub</italic> is genetically required for the influence of spectrin knockdown on Yki activity and wing growth. Taken together, these observations indicate that β<sub>H</sub>-Spec and α-Spec regulate Hippo signaling in wing discs through the Jub-biomechanical pathway, rather than through hypothesized alternate mechanisms.</p>
<p>Spectrin has been suggested to form two distinct complexes in <italic>Drosophila</italic> epithelial cells, (αβ)<sub>2</sub> and (αβ<sub>H</sub>)<sub>2</sub> heterotetramers, which localize to the lateral and apical sides of cells, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Deng <italic>et al</italic>., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Dubreuil <italic>et al</italic>., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Fletcher <italic>et al</italic>., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Lee <italic>et al</italic>., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Thomas <italic>et al</italic>., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Zarnescu and Thomas, 1999</xref>). However, our observations indicate that β<sub>H</sub>-Spec functions independently of α-Spec in wing imaginal discs. α-Spec and β<sub>H</sub>-Spec do not exhibit significant co-localization. Moreover, α-Spec and β<sub>H</sub>-Spec are not required for each other’s localization to apical cell junctions. This contrasts with the requirement for β-Spec for recruitment of α-Spec to lateral membranes in wing discs. The requirement is not entirely reciprocal, as α-Spec knockdown only partially reduces β-Spec recruitment, but this likely reflects mechanisms that recruit spectrins to cell membranes: β-spectrin subunits, but not α-spectrin subunits, have a pleckstrin homology domain that can mediate membrane association, as well as possessing the CH domains that mediate F-actin association. Without these, and without β-Spec, α-Spec does not have a way to associate with lateral membranes.</p>
<p>An independent role for β<sub>H</sub>-Spec has also been suggested in mammalian photoreceptors, where it was reported that that mammalian βV-Spec does not colocalize with αII-spectrin, and that βV-spec could form homodimers, potentially allowing it to cross-link actin by itself, enabling α-Spec-independent functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Papal <italic>et al</italic>., 2013</xref>). The observation that a mutation in <italic>Drosophila</italic> α-Spec that disrupts binding to β-Spec <italic>in vitro</italic> has only mild phenotypes also suggests that spectrin functions do not depend entirely on αβ interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Khanna <italic>et al</italic>., 2015</xref>). Collectively, our results together with these earlier studies emphasize that the dogma that “Spectrin comprises α-and β-subunits that interact in an antiparallel manner to form an αβ dimer” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Liem, 2016</xref>) should be revised.</p>
<p>The conclusion that β<sub>H</sub>-Spec and α-Spec act independently implies that they influence tension at apical junctions through distinct mechanisms. α-Spec might influence AJ tension in wing discs through the mechanism proposed to explain the influence of α- and β-Spec in pupal eyes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Deng <italic>et al</italic>., 2020</xref>). It was inferred that α- and β-Spec maintain cell rigidity by linking F-actin to membranes. In the absence of α- or β-Spec, it was proposed that dissociation between F-actin and the membrane leads to an expansion of the cell cortex. This cell shape change increases cytoskeletal tension at AJs, which bind F-actin independently of spectrins. Consistent with this, we observed a decrease in cell height in α-Spec knockdown cells in wing discs. These alterations in cell shape were not observed in β<sub>H</sub>-Spec knockdown cells, further supporting the conclusion that β<sub>H</sub>-Spec and α-Spec act independently to regulate junctional tension.</p>
<p>Instead, our experiments analyzing the relationship between β<sub>H</sub>-Spec and myosin revealed an entirely different mechanism by which β<sub>H</sub>-Spec influences tension at AJ. We observed a mutual antagonism between β<sub>H</sub>-Spec and myosin <italic>in vivo</italic> for localization to apical F-actin: decreasing β<sub>H</sub>-Spec increases junctional myosin, while increasing β<sub>H</sub>-Spec decreases junctional myosin. Reciprocally, increasing myosin activity decreases β<sub>H</sub>-Spec localization to apical F-actin, while decreasing myosin activity increases β<sub>H</sub>-Spec localization to apical F-actin. In vitro studies with purified protein domains revealed that myosin can compete with β<sub>H</sub>-Spec for binding to F-actin. Finally, computational modeling of protein structures revealed that myosin and β<sub>H</sub>-Spec would interfere with each other’s binding to F-actin. Together, these observations indicate that β<sub>H</sub>-Spec and myosin directly compete with each other for localization to F-actin. The influence of β<sub>H</sub>-Spec on junctional tension is thus a direct consequence of its competition with myosin for overlapping binding sites on F-actin.</p>
<p>Despite β<sub>H</sub>-Spec and myosin sharing overlapping binding sites on F-actin, and competing reciprocally in vivo, in our co-sedimentation experiments we could only detect a partial ability of myosin to compete for β<sub>H</sub>-Spec binding, and we could not detect an ability of β<sub>H</sub>-Spec to compete for myosin binding. Several factors are likely to contribute to these observations. First, we could not use higher protein concentrations of myosin or β<sub>H</sub>-Spec due to the need to keep the salt concentration constant and close to physiological levels, and to prevent protein precipitation. Second, it has been suggested for β-Spec that the CH2 domain regulates the actin binding function of the CH1 domain through steric hindrance when the two domains are associated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Avery <italic>et al</italic>., 2017</xref>). A specific mutation in β-Spec CH2 (L253P) has been shown to lower the energetic barrier between closed and open structural states, increasing the affinity of β-Spec for F-actin around 1000-fold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Avery et al., 2016</xref>), but it is unknown how β-Spec or β<sub>H</sub>-Spec conformational changes are normally regulated in vivo and whether both proteins share this regulatory feature. Additionally, phosphorylation of myosin regulatory light chain shifts myosin from a compact, autoinhibited conformation to a filamentous, active conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Kiehart and Feghali, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Vasquez et al., 2016</xref>). The autoinhibited conformation binds F-actin very weakly (K<sub>D</sub>&gt;100 μM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Heissler and Manstein, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Sellers et al., 1982</xref>) compared to the active conformation, suggesting that spectrin could outcompete autoinhibited myosin more effectively than active myosin for binding to F-actin. In addition, other factors including other actin-binding proteins and cytoskeletal tension are likely to influence the dynamic localization and actin-binding properties of both proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Duan <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Greenberg et al., 2016</xref>).</p>
<p>The competition between β<sub>H</sub>-Spec and myosin also provides key insights into how β<sub>H</sub>-Spec contributes to ratcheting of apical constriction. The apical constriction of cells in the ventral furrow that initiates <italic>Drosophila</italic> mesoderm invagination occurs through fast constriction pulses interrupted by pauses during which cells must stabilize their constricted state before reinitiating constriction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Martin et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Xie and Martin, 2015</xref>). This ratcheting-like behavior is thought to be a consequence of the finite length of actin filaments. Myosin contracts the cytoskeleton by driving filaments past each other, and extensive contractions require release and reassociation with new pairs of filaments. β<sub>H</sub>-Spec participates in ratcheting of apical constriction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Krueger et al., 2020</xref>). When β<sub>H</sub>-Spec is knocked down, cells can undergo cycles of unratcheted apical constriction during which they alternately constrict and then expand. Consequently, most β<sub>H</sub>-Spec depleted embryos fail to complete normal mesoderm invagination. It was proposed that the actin cross-linking function of β<sub>H</sub>-Spec could hold F-actin in place for the next cycle of myosin mediated-contraction, but this raises the question of how myosin and β<sub>H</sub>-Spec association with F-actin are coordinated so that β<sub>H</sub>-Spec prevents relaxation without interfering with constriction. Our results suggest a simple solution: since they compete for the same binding site, the release of myosin from F-actin at the end of a cycle of contraction would naturally be coupled to the accessibility of F-actin for binding by β<sub>H</sub>-Spec. Thus the competition between myosin and β<sub>H</sub>-Spec for binding to F-actin enables myosin-mediated cell contraction to effectively alternate with β<sub>H</sub>-Spec-mediated stabilization.</p>

A stock medium was prepared using Grace’s medium (Sigma, G9771) without sodium bicarbonate but with the addition of 5 mM Bis-Tris and the pH was adjusted to 6.6-6.7 at room temperature. This was stored at 4ºC for less than a month. Before every experiment, we added 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS; ThermoFisher, 10082147), Penicillin-Streptomycin (Thermo-Fisher, #15070063, 100X stock solution) and 10 nM 20-hydroxy-ecdysone (Sigma, H5142) to the medium. Larvae were floated on 25% sucrose and transferred into glass dishes with culture medium. Larvae of the desired genotype were selected and sterilized in 70% ethanol for 1 min. Then, we drew a circle on the glass bottom of a 35-mm glass-bottomed Petri dish (MatTek, P35G-0-14-C) using glue made by mixing heptane with tape (Tesa, 5388). Wing discs were dissected out of larvae, transferred into this Petri dish, and oriented using tungsten needles. Then we covered the discs with a Cyclopore Polycarbonate membrane (GE Health, 7060-2513) and glued it to the glass bottom to immobilize discs. Discs were imaged every 0.2 s on a Perkin Elmer Ultraview spinning disc confocal microscope, and ablation of junctions was achieved using a Micropoint pulsed laser (Andor Technology) tuned to 365 nm. Paired cutting of junctions, one in the anterior compartment and another in the posterior compartment at a similar location, were performed and compared. The displacement of vertices for the first second after ablation was used to calculate the velocities.</p>

<title>Quantification and Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>To obtain the surface of the wing disc and remove signals from the peripodial epithelium, we used the MATLAB toolbox ImSAnE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Heemskerk and Streichan, 2015</xref>) to detect and isolate a slice of the disc epithelium that surrounds the adherens junctions, using E-cad as a reference, as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Pan et al., 2016</xref>). The KstGFP, KstYFP, SqhGFP and JubGFP images were created using ImSAnE. For septate junctions images, the surface detector was moved just below the E-cadherin level.</p>
<p>For the fluorescence intensity heat maps, a custom MATLAB script was used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Alegot <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Pan <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/alegoth/Wing-disc-Intensity-Analysis">https://github.com/alegoth/Wing-disc-Intensity-Analysis</ext-link>). The script generates a 3D mask with the normalization channel (E-cad) keeping only the relevant pixels. The wing disc center (intersection between AP/DV boundaries) is picked for each image manually. Then, the picture is split into blocks of a given <italic>xy</italic> size (3×3 μm), starting from the center, and the average intensity per pixel of each channel is measured. The intensity of the reference channel and the channel of interest are normalized over their respective average intensity. The ratio of the channel of interest over the reference channel is then determined. To average several discs, only matrices of the same <italic>xy</italic> size blocks were used. The center of the disc serves as a reference point; smaller matrices were expanded to correspond to the size of the biggest matrix and filled with NaN (Not-a-Number). We determined the minimum number of values required (usually three) to average the ratio for a given position. This means that the edges of the average disk are composed of the same minimum number of values, which corresponds to the <italic>n</italic> given for each experiment. Finally, signals from several wing discs were averaged and represented by the heat map, and a posterior versus anterior ratio was calculated.</p>
<p>Pearson’s correlation coefficient was calculated to establish co-localization between different proteins by using the Coloc 2 Plugin for ImageJ (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://imagej.net/plugins/coloc-2">https://imagej.net/plugins/coloc-2</ext-link>).</p>
<p>Statistical significance was determined with GraphPad Prism software by performing Student’s t-test (for comparison between two observations) or analysis of variance (ANOVA) with P&lt;0.05 set as the criteria for significance. The Dunnett test was used to derive adjusted P-values for comparisons against the control experimental value, and the Tukey test was used to derive adjusted P-values for multiple comparisons.</p>

<title>Protein production and purification</title>
<p>To purify the actin binding domain of β<sub>H</sub>-Spec fused with GST, we transformed BL21-DE3 cells (NEB) with pGEX-3X-ABDkst. Protein expression was induced with 0.2 mM isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactoside (IPTG) at room temperature for 12–15 h. Cells were harvested and lysed by sonication in lysis buffer: PBS (pH 7.4), 1% Triton X-100, 5 mM dithiothreitol, 1 mM phenylmethyl sulfonyl fluoride and complete Mini Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Roche). After centrifugation, the supernatant was collected and passed through a 1 mL GST-Trap column (Cytiva) at 4 °C. Then, the column was washed with PBS (pH 7.4) until the absorbance reached a steady baseline. To remove the GST-tag, the column was loaded with 80 units of Factor Xa (New England Biolabs, P8010) in cleavage buffer: 50 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, pH 7.5 and incubated for 16 h at room temperature. To elute the ABD of β<sub>H</sub>-Spec while removing the protease simultaneously, we used a HiTrap Benzamidine FF (Cytiva) column in tandem with the GST-trap column and eluted the ABD of β<sub>H</sub>-spec with cleavage buffer. To switch buffers, we dialyzed the protein against 25 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM TCP overnight. Then the purified protein was concentrated by ultrafiltration to 30 μM and stored at −80ºC until used in experiments.</p>

<p>Ibar and colleagues investigate the function of spectrin in Drosophila wing imaginal discs and its effect on the Hippo pathway and myosin activity. The authors find that both βH-Spec and its canonical binding partner α-Spec reduce junctional localization of the protein Jub and thereby restrict Jub's inhibitory effect on Hippo signaling resulting in activation of the Hippo effector Yorkie regulating tissue shape and organ size. From genetic epistasis analysis and analysis of protein localization, the authors conclude that βH-Spec and α-Spec act independently in this regulation. The major point of this study is that the apical localization of βH-Spec and myosin is mutually exclusive and that the proteins antagonize each other's activity in wing discs. In vitro co-sedimentation assays and in silico structural modeling suggest that this antagonization is due to a competition of βH-Spec and myosin for F-actin binding.</p>
<p>The study's strengths are the genetic perturbation that is the basis for the epistasis analysis which includes specific knockdowns of the genes of interest as well as an elegant CRISPR-based overexpression system with great tissue specificity. The choice of the model for such an in-depth analysis of pathway dependencies in a well-characterized tissue makes it possible to identify and characterize quantitative differences between closely entangled and mutually dependent components. The method of quantifying protein localization and abundance is common for multiple figures which makes it easy to assess differences across experiments.</p>
<p>A weakness in the methodology is the link to tissue tension and conclusions about tissue mechanics. Methods that directly affect tissue tension and a more thorough and systematic application of laser ablation experiments would be needed to profoundly investigate mechanosensation and consequential effects on tissue tension by the various genetic perturbations. While the in-silico analysis of competing for F-actin binding sites for βH-Spec and myosin appears logical and supports the authors' claims, no point mutation or truncations were used to test these results in vivo. In its current structure the manuscript's strength, the genetic perturbations, is compromised by missing clear assessments of knockdown efficiencies early in the manuscript and other controls such as the actual effect on myosin by ROCK overactivation.</p>
<p>The flow of experiments is logical and in general, the author's conclusions are supported by the presented data. The findings are very well embedded into the context of relevant literature and both confronting and confirming literature are discussed.</p>
<p>The study shows how components of the cytoskeleton are directly involved in the regulation of the mechanosensitive Hippo pathway in vivo and thus ultimately regulate organ size supporting previous data in other contexts. The molecular mechanism regulating myosin activity by out-competing it for F-actin binding has been observed for small actin-binding proteins such as cofilin but is a new mode for such a big, membrane-associated actin-binding protein. This may inspire future experiments in different morphogenetic contexts for the investigation of similar mechanisms. For example, the antagonistic activity of βH-Spec and myosin in this tissue context might help explain phenomena in other systems such as spectrin-dependent ratcheting of apical constriction during mesoderm invagination (as the authors discuss). Against the classical view, the work shows that βH-Spec can act independently of α-Spec. Together the results will be of interest to the cell biology community with a focus on the cytoskeleton and mechanotransduction.</p>

<p>Ibar and colleagues address the role of the spectrin cytoskeleton in the regulation of tissue growth and Hippo signaling in an attempt to elucidate the underlying molecular mechanism(s) and reconcile existing data. Previous reports in the field have suggested three distinct mechanisms by which the Spectrin cytoskeleton regulates Hippo signaling and this is, at least in part, due to the fact that different groups have mainly focused on different spectrins (alpha, beta, or beta-heavy) in previous reports.</p>
<p>The authors start their investigation by trying to reconcile their previous data on the role of Ajuba in the regulation of Hippo signaling via mechanotransduction and previous observations suggesting that Spectrins affect Hippo signaling independently of any effect on myosin levels or Ajuba localization. Contrary to previous reports, the authors reveal that, indeed, depletion of alpha- and beta-heavy-spectrin leads to an increase in myosin levels at the apical membrane. Moreover, the authors also reveal that the depletion of spectrins leads to an increase in Ajuba levels.</p>
<p>The authors suggest that Ajuba is required for the effect of beta-heavy spectrin. However, it is still formally possible that this could be a parallel pathway that is being masked by the strong phenotype of Ajuba RNAi flies.</p>
<p>One of the major points of the manuscript is the observation that alpha- and beta-heavy-spectrin are potentially working independently and not as part of a spectrin tetramer. This is mostly dependent on the observation that alpha- and beta-heavy-spectrin appear to have non-overlapping localizations at the membrane and the fact that alpha- and beta-heavy-spectrin localize at the membrane seemingly independently. It is not entirely obvious that a potential lack of colocalization and the fact that protein localization at the membrane is not affected when the other partner is absent is sufficient to argue that alpha- and beta-heavy-spectrin do not form a complex. Moreover, it is possible that the spectrin complexes are only formed in specific conditions (e.g. by modulating tissue tension).</p>
<p>If indeed spectrins function independently, would it not be expected to see additive effects when both spectrins are depleted?</p>
<p>Related to the two previous points, the fact that the authors suggest that both alpha- and beta-heavy-spectrin regulate Hippo signaling via Ajuba would be consistent with the necessity of an alpha- and beta-heavy-spectrin complex being formed. How would the authors explain that both spectrins require Ajuba function but work independently?</p>
<p>Another major point of the manuscript is the potential competition between beta-heavy-spectrin and myosin for F-actin binding. The authors suggest that there is a mutual antagonism between the two proteins regarding apical F-actin. However, this has not been formally assessed. Moreover, despite the arguments put forward in the discussion, it seems hard to justify a competition for F-actin when beta-heavy-spectrin seems to be unable to compete with myosin. Myosin can displace beta-heavy-spectrin from F-actin but the reciprocal effect seems unlikely given the in vitro data.</p>
