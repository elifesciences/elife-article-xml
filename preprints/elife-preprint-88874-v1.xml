<title>Abstract</title><p>Thymus-originated tTregs and <italic>in vitro</italic> induced iTregs are subsets of regulatory T cells. While they share the capacity of immune suppression, their stabilities are different, with iTregs losing their phenotype upon stimulation or under inflammatory milieu. Epigenetic differences, particularly methylation state of Foxp3 CNS2 region, provide an explanation for this shift. Whether additional regulations, including cellular signaling, could directly lead phenotypical instability requires further analysis. Here we show that upon TCR triggering, store-operated calcium entry (SOCE) and NFAT nuclear translocation are blunted in tTregs, yet fully operational in iTregs, similar to Tconvs. On the other hand, tTregs show minimal changes in their chromatin accessibility upon activation, in contrast to iTregs that demonstrate an activated chromatin state with highly accessible T cell activation and inflammation related genes. Assisted by several cofactors, NFAT driven by strong SOCE signaling in iTregs preferentially binds to primed opened T helper (T<sub>H</sub>) genes, resulting in their activation normally observed only in Tconv activation, ultimately leads to instability. Conversely, suppression of SOCE in iTregs can partially rescue their phenotype. Thus our study adds two new layer, cellular signaling and chromatin accessibility, of understanding in Treg stability, and may provide a path for better clinical applications of Treg cell therapy.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The regulatory T cells (Tregs) are key to maintain peripheral immune tolerance and to block excessive inflammatory reactions. There are two main populations of Tregs. The prototypical one originates from the thymus (tTreg/nTreg), sharing a developmental program similar to conventional T cells <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. Their TCRs are believed to have higher basal affinity to MHC, and express Foxp3 during CD4 single positive period <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. The other population originates from the periphery (pTregs) via conversion of Tconvs, arising during inflammation with proper antigenic stimulation and inductive cytokine environment <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>. iTregs, mimicking the induction of pTregs, is a type of Tregs induced <italic>in vitro</italic> in the presence of TGF-Î² <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. While iTregs share similarity in suppressive capacities to Tregs <italic>in vivo</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>, they are different from tTregs in several aspects, particularly regarding their stabilities. Although tTregs in some occasions show certain levels of plasticity, their phenotypes are mostly stable, both <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. iTregs induced <italic>in vitro</italic> are more labile with marked loss of Foxp3 expression after activation, limiting the duration of their suppression <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>. The short life of iTregs is also a roadblocker of the clinical use of Treg cell therapy, as they cannot be used as an alternative source to replace numerically limited tTregs <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>; and in cases where iTregs are raised with targeted specificities, they carry concerns of potential self-reactivity following the loss of Foxp3.</p>
<p>The stability of tTregs is established prior to their exit from the thymus <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. In the thymus, Foxp3 works with other transcription factors, such as NFAT and c-Rel to maintain a steady transcriptional program <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. At the same time, the extensive demethylation of FoxP3 CNS2 is also critical to their stable phenotype, an event likely taking place before FoxP3 expression <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. While epigenetic differences provide a possible explanation of Treg stability, it is more probable that multiple factors collectively contribute to the difference. Unlike Tconvs that undergo expansion, attrition and memory states after activation, tTregs lose signature changes and return to their original state following activation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. This persistence in phenotype of tTregs is certainly beneficial to the host, yet mechanisms for this maintenance, in contrast to the lack thereof in iTregs are incompletely understood. Previous work suggests that TCR signal as well as ensuing Ca<sup>2+</sup> activities are weaker in tTregs <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>, whether the reduced TCR signaling strength is the root of tTreg stability remains an intrigue, particularly strong TCR engagement facilitates iTregsâ loss of phenotype.</p>
<p>Here we report a surprising finding that may contribute to the iTregsâ phenotypical change after their activation. We found that ligation of TCR induces long vibration of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals in Tconvs that lasts for hours, as typically expected in the SOCE activation. Initially similar, this vibration is quickly diminished in tTregs, correlating with their reduced response to TCR stimulation. In contrast, in iTregs, this Ca<sup>2+</sup> vibration is indistinguishable from Tconvs. The sustained Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal leads to a strong NFAT activation in iTregs. Regarding chromatin accessibility, with the aid of our initial observation of iTregs from the perspective of activated Tconv, we found iTregs also show an âactivatedâ chromatin state with T cell activation and inflammation related genes highly open. We demonstrate that the NFAT nuclear translocation driven by sustained calcium signal allows its direct access to prime-opened T<sub>H</sub> genes and upregulate their expression, destabilizing iTregs. As expected, blocking CRAC channel reverses the loss of FoxP3 in iTregs <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. Our work therefore suggests that Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling and accessible chromatin state in iTregs are two key causes in their loss of stability following activation, which may be of important value to understand how these two populations of Tregs operate in the disease conditions and lead to better applications of iTregs in the clinic.</p>

<title>iTregs use a suppression mechanism similar to that of tTregs</title>
<p>In our previous work, we found that Tregs show strong binding to DCs, which is a key mechanism for blocking DCâs ability to engage other Tconvs <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>. The strong binding is due to low basal calcium oscillation of tTregs in the steady state <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>, which leads to diminished mCalpain activation and commensurate reduced internalization of LFA-1. Furthermore, our previous study showed the low calcium oscillation is maintained by reduced expression of endosomal Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel Ryr2 by Foxp3 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>. To ascertain that this regulation is also central to iTregs, we produced iTregs from Tconvs. With plate bound anti-CD3/CD28 and in the presence of TGF-Î², iTregs were induced and the percentage was maximized on day 2. We found that <italic>in vitro</italic> iTregs show slightly stronger suppression than tTregs on OT-II proliferation in response to epitope peptide loaded DCs (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>). In accordance with the stronger suppression, single cell force spectroscopy analysis showed that iTregs possessed apparent binding to DCs, even stronger than tTregs (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref>). In addition, iTregs also showed increased binding force compared with activated Tconvs (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1C</xref>), suggesting the strong binding force is a common feature of both types of Tregs, but not Tconvs. We measured the expression of FoxP3 more precisely, and noticed that the protein level expression of FoxP3 reached its peak on day 2 after the induction (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1D</xref>). With the accumulation of FoxP3 protein, basal Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillation in the treated Tconvs was gradually diminished, with the former leading the latter roughly by one day (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1E</xref>). As expected, the transcription level of Ryr2 was suppressed both in iTregs and tTregs y<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Fig S1A</xref>), suggesting that the strong binding force with DC may come from reduced calcium oscillation as a result of FoxP3-mediated suppression of Ryr2 transcription. While Ryr2 expression may be regulated by Foxp3, the induction efficiency of Foxp3 was not affected by Ryr2 knock out (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Fig S1B</xref>). Therefore, we show iTregs can apply a suppression mechanism similar to tTregs, which operates via the indirect inhibition via DC blockage. We do not know why iTregs show a stronger suppression than tTregs, an event maybe related to their activation in the induction process.</p>

<title>Sustainment of SOCE and NFAT nuclear translocation are reduced in tTregs, but not in iTregs</title>
<p>It was reported previously that TCR signaling led to a dramatic reduction of FoxP3+ cells in iTregs, but not in tTregs <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>. We reproduced this data in our lab (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A</xref>). tTregs have been reported to show an attenuated response to TCR triggering <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>, the exact point of signal attenuation in tTregs has not been elucidated. In immune cells, there are mainly three types of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals, the steady state low level Ryr2-based membrane proximal Ca<sup>2+</sup> âpuffâ; the TCR ligation-triggered, inositol triphosphate-mediated IP3R opening on the ER membrane; and ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> depletion-induced, sustained Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx upon SOCE activation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>. As the extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> is roughly 4 logs higher than the intracellular, SOCE activation is by far the strongest Ca<sup>2+</sup> event in T cells (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Fig S2A</xref>), and is also distinct from the other Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling patterns for its persistent vibration lasting hrs to days <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>.</p>

<p>We wondered if the reported TCR signal truncation in tTregs was manifested as reduced SOCE activities. We titrated anti CD3/CD28 concentrations, and iTregs lost Foxp3 at the lowest dose required to activate, yet tTregs were resistant to an 8-fold increase in both (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Fig S2B</xref>). To study the molecular basis for the weak response in tTregs, we first monitored the early SOCE intensity in iTregs and tTregs, we found the first wave of SOCE in iTregs was slightly higher than Tconvs and tTregs, but there was no discernable difference between tTregs and Tconvs (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2B</xref>). In addition, the phosphorylation of CD3Î¶ was similar in Tconv and nTreg immediately after TCR crosslink (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Fig S2C</xref>). As full T cell activation requires sustained SOCE activation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>, we extended the observation time window. As SOCE signal is synchronized upon initial TCR trigger, each individual T cell SOCE oscillation hours into activation is no longer in unison <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>, we therefore recorded Ca<sup>2+</sup> waves in individual cells. In Tconvs and iTregs, Ca<sup>2+</sup> remained cyclic waves expected in SOCE pulsation. In contrast, this Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal was suddenly lost in tTregs 40-50 min after the activation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2C</xref>) (Movie 1-3).</p>
<p>In contrast to other transcriptional factors, such as NF-ÎºB, activated rapidly in response to short Ca<sup>2+</sup> elevation, NFATs are known to be triggered only by sustained cytoplasmic Ca<sup>2+</sup> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>. Indeed, in contrast to iTregs and Tconvs, tTregsâ NFATc1 and c2 failed to translocate into the nucleus (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2D</xref>). Upon detailed analysis, in iTregs, anti-CD3/CD28 stimulation led a quick drop in cytoplasmic NFAT in two hours, with moderate accumulation of NFAT in the nucleus (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Fig S2D</xref>). This was followed by continuous synthesis of NFAT in the cytoplasm and accumulation of nuclear NFAT <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>. While tTregs are known to have reduced NFAT activation in response to TCR ligation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>, our results pointed to a truncated Ca<sup>2+</sup> response likely to be the molecular basis for this phenotype. With this association potentially established, we wondered if the length of SOCE itself is sufficient to explain the stability difference between iTregs and tTregs. Non-specific Ca<sup>2+</sup> membrane permeability modifier such as ionomycin resulted in large scale cell death (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Fig S2E</xref>), we therefore used SERCA inhibitor Thapsigargin (TG). Blocking SERCA leads to endosome Ca<sup>2+</sup> reloading blockage that leads to continuous translocation of STIMs to the plasma membrane-ER junction and Orai channel opening. In contrast to indiscriminating Ca<sup>2+</sup> overload, pure SOCE activation was not followed by significant cell death (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Fig S2E</xref>). As expected, some tTregs treated with TG lost their Foxp3 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3E</xref>). These results collectively argue that the truncated Ca<sup>2+</sup> in tTregs is essential to protect tTregs from phenotypical shift.</p>

<title>iTregs display activated chromatin state with highly open activation region</title>
<p>As shown, the behaviors of SOCE signaling and NFAT of iTregs were closer to their precursor Tconvs rather than tTregs, we were curious about the systemic similarity among iTregs, Tconvs and tTregs. Therefore, we performed RNA-seq and Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin with high-throughput sequencing (ATAC-seq) of iTregs, together with resting/activated tTregs and Tconvs.</p>
<p>In RNA-seq data, principal component analysis (PCA) and heatmap of DEG indicated that Tconvs were quite different before and after activation, but the changes of tTregs before and after TCR activation were more limited compared with Tconvs (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3A</xref> and <xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Fig S3C</xref>), verifying that tTregs have low TCR responsiveness. Comparing the transcriptome characteristics with other cell types, iTregs acquired partial Treg features after induction, shown as an intermediate between Tconvs and tTregs on PC2 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3A</xref> and <xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Fig S3B</xref>). While among all cell states, iTregs had the highest PC1 scores, represents higher proliferation state, probably due to the 4 days of induction (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3A</xref> and <xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Fig S3A</xref>).</p>
<p>Next, we analyzed the chromatin accessibility of these cells using ATAC-seq data. In the PCA plot, tTregs showed fewer changes after activation compared to Tconvs, while iTregs were closer to activated Tconv cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3C</xref>). In differential peak heatmap clustered by cell type, Tconvs became more accessible in âActivation Regionâ after activation, and with a dramatic increase in the overall accessibility (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3C</xref>). However, the changes of tTregs after activation are limited, the majority of tTreg-specific accessible region, named âTreg Regionâ, were not changed. Also the activation region opening seen in Tconvs were not more accessible in tTregs (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3C</xref>). All of these characteristics indicated that tTreg phenotype is highly ensured by their low TCR responsiveness which potentially led to their refusal to change chromatin accessibility seen in Tconvs following activation.</p>
<p>When comparing iTregs with the others, we found iTregs were highly accessible in activation region found in activated Tconvs (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3C</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3D</xref>). However, only a few Treg specific peaks shown in Treg region were opened in iTregs (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3C</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3E</xref>). For further analysis, we isolated Treg specific peaks. It was clear that most of them were opened in tTregs but showed little accessibility in iTregs (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Fig S3D</xref>). For example, Foxp3 and Ctla4, expressed in both tTregs and iTregs, show high accessibility in resting and activated tTregs, but were closed or only partially opened in iTregs (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3G</xref>). In contrast, genes related to inflammation cytokine in T helper cells, such as Ifng, Il4, Il17ra and Il21, were highly opened in iTregs (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3F</xref>).</p>
<p>Overall, we showed that at the gene expression level, iTregs have acquired some Treg features, but the chromatin accessibility was mostly trapped in activated Tconv state, not only with regard to the closed Treg genes, but also with genes associated with T activation and inflammation highly opened. The latter is expected to be mainly closed in genuine Tregs in accordance with their lower responsiveness to TCR triggering. We speculate that this âunconvertedâ chromatin accessibility, especially the highly opened activated genes will contribute to iTreg instability upon TCR stimulation. It is therefore interesting whether NFAT accumulated in nuclei driven by sustained calcium oscillation will indeed target those genes for an activation state unfit for their phenotypical stability.</p>

<title>SOCE and NFAT directly leads to phenotypical instability in iTregs</title>
<p>To further validate the role of calcium and NFAT in iTreg instability, we used inhibitors cyclosporine A (CsA) and CM-4620 to suppress calcium signal and NFAT, respectively. We found that inhibition of calcium or NFAT rescued the Foxp3 expression in iTregs upon restimulation (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4A</xref>). Another SOCE inhibitor BTP2 was also verified (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Fig S4A</xref>). Accordingly, ionomycin, which can directly induce calcium release independent of TCR activation, also lead to iTreg instability (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Fig S4B</xref>). Thus, NFAT and calcium signaling blockage was correlated to iTreg stability.</p>

<p>To investigate how NFAT and calcium signaling destabilize iTregs, we performed RNA-seq on these cells. From the differential gene expression and principal component analysis, we found that iTregs upon restimulation showed significant differences from the resting state at the transcriptome level, and this difference could be substantially reduced with inhibition of calcium or NFAT (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4B</xref>). As shown in the PCA plot, calcium/NFAT-blocked iTregs were significantly closer to the resting state than the unstable ones (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4C</xref>). Thus, inhibition of calcium or NFAT can significantly improve the stability of iTregs as reflected by transcriptomic identity. In addition, the large overlap (about 80%) of genes that were rescued by CM-4620 and by CsA further supported that calcium signaling change the fate of iTregs mainly through NFAT (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4D</xref>).</p>
<p>Among the genes rescued by CM-4620 and CsA, they can be further divided into two groups. Members of the first group were downregulated upon restimulation and the downregulation was blocked by inhibition of calcium and NFAT. This result indicating that these genes are downregulated by NFAT. Among these genes, several of them are critical for functions and stability of Tregs, such as Foxp3, Id3, Il10rb, Sema4a, Tgfbr1/2, Ms4a4b, Nlrp6 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4B</xref> and <xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Fig S4C</xref>). In the functional analysis of these genes, we found that Rap-1 pathway, PD-1/PD-L1 pathway and Foxo pathway were significantly enriched (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Fig S4D</xref>). Loss of these genes was therefore consistent with the phenotype of iTreg instability.</p>
<p>The other group had genes that were otherwise upregulated after restimulation, but failed to do so with CM-4620 or CsA, indicating that these genes are upregulated by NFAT. In these genes, many of them are associated with T helper differentiation and T cell activation, such as Il21, Il12rb2, Tbx21, Gzma, Stat2, Stat3, Atf3, Fasl (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4B</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4F</xref>). Among them, Il21 encodes a key cytokine in Th17 differentiation, Tbx21, encoding T-bet, and Il12rb2 are key transcriptional factors and cytokine receptor for Th1 differentiation. Functional enrichment analysis of these upregulated genes pointed to Th17 related pathway and Th1/Th2 related pathways (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4E</xref>). Further validation of these upregulation T helper related genes (T<sub>H</sub> genes) by NFAT was perform by QPCR (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4G</xref>). These results in all indicated the iTreg restimulation was associated with a strong tendency of differentiation towards non-Treg polarization, and NFAT was likely a key regulator in this process.</p>

<title>NFAT upregulate prime-opened T<sub>H</sub> genes to destabilize iTregs</title>
<p>To further study the role of NFAT in iTreg instability, we performed Cut&amp;Tag assay to acquire the NFAT binding sites in resting iTregs and those after restimulation (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5A</xref>). NFAT-flag and anti-Flag antibody was used to capture peaks that were bound by NFAT (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Fig S5A</xref>).

<p>For those upregulated T<sub>H</sub> genes, we speculated that this may be associated with the highly âactivatedâ chromatin state of iTregs mentioned earlier. Therefore, we first checked the chromatin accessibility around the transcription start site (TSS) in those genes and found that this group of genes was significantly more accessible in iTregs than in tTregs and Tconvs (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5C</xref>). As shown in the genome browser view, Il21, Il12rb2 and Tbx21 were more open in iTregs, even more so than the activated Tconvs (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Fig S5B</xref>). Further analysis revealed that NFAT significantly increased their binding to the TSS regions on upregulated Th genes after restimulation (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5D</xref>), while showing little change on downregulated Treg genes (<xref rid="figS5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5SD</xref>). As shown by Il21, Tbx21 and Il12rb2, after activation, NFAT accumulated at the sites that were prime-opened resulting in their increased expression (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5E</xref>). Therefore, the enhanced chromatin accessibility revealed in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4</xref> was indeed approached by the large amount of NFAT, leading to T cell polarization towards other directions with a sole reciprocal loss of polarization towards Tregs. This tendency may to some extent explain the rapid loss of iTreg phenotype.</p>
<p>As one potential counter argument, NFAT is ostensibly essential to the development of tTregs <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>. In the induction of iTregs, NFAT in collaboration with SMAD is also critical <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>. It is therefore intriguing why NFAT re-activation after iTreg formation may serve as a key factor in compromising iTreg stability. To resolve those seemingly contradictory regulations, we performed NFAT motif enrichment analysis. The results showed that putative BATF, AP-1(Fos/Jun), RORg binding sites were highly enriched in restimulation state specific regions (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5F</xref>). For the preference of different co-factors to different gene subsets, SMAD family tended to bind to genes that were downregulated by NFAT, for example, Foxp3, while AP-1 and RORg preferred binding to genes that were upregulated by NFAT, such as T<sub>H</sub> genes (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5G</xref>). Taken together, our results appear to suggest that upon restimulation of iTregs, NFAT prefers to cooperate with AP-1/RORg to promote the expression of prime opened T<sub>H</sub> gene expression, and at the same time denies the SMAD programming that may be critical to maintain Treg functions and stabilities. Certainly, how much this selective cooperation between NFAT and other transcriptional factors contributes to iTreg instability remains speculative until large scale ChIP-seq analyses are performed on the players involved.</p>

<title>Reduction of SOCE enhances iTreg stability and suppressive potential</title>
<p>Given that sustained calcium signal and NFAT translocation can directly disrupt iTreg stability, we asked whether manipulation of calcium signaling or NFAT can conversely be used to stabilize those cells. As Treg suppression assays require the participation of other T cells which are sensitive to inhibitory agents added indiscriminately, after regular iTreg induction, we overexpressed a dominant negative ORAI (DN-ORAI), whose single monomer incorporation will lead to a functionally disabled ORAI hexamer, to control the SOCE signal upon iTreg restimulation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>. As expected, the mutated ORAI reduced the SOCE signaling by about a half (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6A</xref>). When we restimulated this DN-ORAI expressing iTregs with anti-CD3/CD28, they showed stronger stability with higher retention of Foxp3 than WT-ORAI iTregs (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6B</xref>). Consistently, DN-ORAI iTregs displayed more potent suppressive activity than control iTreg in <italic>in vitro</italic> suppression assay (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6C</xref>).</p>

<p>Finally, the stability of DN-ORAI iTregs <italic>in vivo</italic> was examined. In brief, OT-II iTregs were infected with DN-ORAI retrovirus and then purified by GFP fluorescence, then the CD45.2<sup>+</sup> GFP<sup>+</sup> Foxp3-RFP<sup>+</sup> iTregs were adoptively transferred into CD45.1 recipient, and OVA/Alum were administrated to restimulate DN-ORAI iTregs <italic>in vivo</italic>.

These results collectively showed that weakened calcium signal and inhibition of NFAT can quantitatively prevent iTregs from losing more Foxp3 both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>, thus permitting a stronger suppressive capacity and a longer stability.</p>
<p>Based on extensive opening of activation regions approached by NFAT in the process iTreg stimulation, we postulate that openness of activation region could be another crucial feature of Treg stability, in addition to closed Treg region by low TSDR. Beyond the basal regimens of anti-CD3, anti-CD28, IL-2, and TGFÎ², several additional factors have been reported to enhance the stability of iTregs, including the use of retinoic acid, rapamycin, vitamin C, and AS2863619 as well as removal of CD28 signaling. We observed if those new additions in some ways altered the state of TSDR as well as the the openness of activation region. Our findings revealed that Rapamycin and AS tended to close the activation region (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Fig S6A</xref>), while Vc, removal of CD28, and AS increased the accessibility of Treg genes (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Fig S6B</xref>). These results indicate that different treatments have varied impacts on the activation region and Treg region. Hence the selective and combinatorial use of those factors is an interesting proposal in the generation of more stable iTregs.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>tTregs are different from other subsets of CD4 T cells in the thymic determination of their phenotype. To some extent, this centric determination is closer to CD4/CD8 demarcation, rather than other polarizations in the peripheral environment <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. The stable phenotype, even after activation, is critical to provide the baseline immune suppression <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. pTregs/iTregs are driven by the environment. It is logical that those cells should be deprived of their suppressive ability when are no longer needed to avoid unnecessary accumulation of those cells. The current understanding is that during thymic development, FoxP3 CNS2 region is selectively demethylated, allowing several transcriptional factors, such as Ets1 and FoxP3 itself to binding to this location <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. This is one of several epigenetic features that maintain the stability, and TCR signaling in tTregs does not change the pre-established hypomethylation state. Induced Tregs, on the other hand, use a different program that relies on the binding of SMADs to the CNS1 region to initiate FoxP3 expression <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>. This SMAD binding mediated transcription is dependent on Foxp3 H3K4me3 modification. In the absence of SMAD, H3K4me3 is partially lost, resulting in iTreg phenotypical shift <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>. Withstanding this paradigm, iTregs do not immediately lose FoxP3 expression upon TGF-Î² withdrawal, the loss of FoxP3 is evident hours or days after TCR signaling <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>. This indicates that while the epigenetic alterations are necessary, an activation event is required to drive the loss of phenotype. This notion is subtly echoed by the limited TCR signaling in tTregs, implying that the hypo responsiveness to TCR ligation may be a critical feature to maintain their stability.</p>
<p>We observed differences between tTregs and iTregs in calcium signal and Th gene accessibility. tTregs utilize both truncated calcium signal and conserved chromatin accessibility to systematically reduce their TCR responsiveness, ensuring their stability. In contrast, iTregs retain the full strength of the TCR signaling, particularly the sustained vibration of SOCE signal, the key factor that drives NFAT synthesis and nuclear translocation. With the help of several cofactors, such as AP-1, NFAT caused the high expression of these T<sub>H</sub> genes, which subsequently subverts the original differentiation of iTregs, leading to their instability. Direct inhibition of SOCE signaling and NFAT can enhance iTreg stability <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6E</xref>).</p>
<p>Previous observations also showed that the calcium signal in tTreg is weaker than that in Tconvs, and NFAT activity is suppressed in tTregs. The weaker Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal in previous reports was seen as early as 10 min into activation, this contradiction likely reflects the experimental settings and stimulation strength <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>. Nevertheless, in line with our results, inhibition of NFAT by low-dose CsA increased the number of tTreg in atopic dermatitis patients <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>. It seems reasonable to establish an inverse association between SOCE signal and Treg stability. In our analysis of the RNA-seq and chromatin accessibility data, we did not identify any particular mechanism that may account for the distinct Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal patterns in tTregs and iTregs. However, in contrast to Tconvs and iTregs, there must be a negative signal loop that blunts SOCE vibration in tTregs. We tried to sustain the calcium signaling in tTregs forcibly by thapsigargin, and indeed observed loss of Foxp3. However, as we at the moment cannot appreciate the finesse of this regulation, the underlying molecular details will require much more delicate approaches rather the brutal force of ER store depletion. In our view, future investigation in this direction may lead to better understanding of Treg biology as well as innovations in clinical Treg cell therapy.</p>
<p>Our results are consistent with the understanding that Treg-specific hypomethylation is crucial for tTregs to stably express their Treg-specific genes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. Those epigenetic changes are mostly absent in iTregs, resulting in their instability. The differences of accessibility in Treg genes were also observed in our ATAC-seq data. Therefore, current treatments such as Vitamin C and CD28 blockage applied to achieve demethylation and accessibility of Treg genes in iTregs are worthy attempts <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup>. However, our work indicates that at least in ATAC-seq analyses, there are a cluster of activation and differentiation-related peaks present in iTregs that remain silent in tTregs upon TCR stimulation. Critically, these peaks were targeted by abundant NFAT in the iTreg nuclei following activation, leading to the upregulation of Th genes. This tendency of deviation away from Tregs may be another key player to iTreg instability. Our effort to produce highly stable iTregs would likely require a combined approach to demethylate Treg-specific genes and at the same time to block the activation and differentiation-related genes. In our work, targeting NFAT signaling during the restimulation phase appeared to be a potential method. Other ways that can directly close these genes will also likely be beneficial.</p>
<p>In this work, we stress the importance of NFAT signal in the instability of iTregs. Previous research has also unveiled the adverse effects of other TCR signaling pathways on Treg stability, such as NF-ÎºB and mTOR. As all those factors may contribute to the shift in phenotype, it is out of scope of this report to directly compare all those factors. However, the value of this report is the identification of a key difference in Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling under TCR ligation that may explain the stability differences between iTregs and tTregs, which may open the door for additional regulations given the key role of SOCE activity in T cell activation.</p>

<title>AFM Based Single Cell Force Spectroscopy</title>
<p>The experiments were performed as previously described using a JPK CellHesion unit<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup>. In brief, to measure Treg-DC adhesion forces in bicellular system, DC2.4 cells were cultured on untreated glass disks. iTreg/tTreg/Tconv cells were sorted and rested with rhIL2 overnight. The disks were moved into an AFM-compatible chamber and mounted on to the machine stage. The incubator chamber in which the machine was housed was conditioned at 37Â°C and at 5% CO2. A clean cantilever was coated with CellTak (BD), and then used to glue individual iTreg/tTreg/Tconv cells added to the disk. Only round and robust cells were selected for AFM gluing. The AFM cantilever carrying a single iTreg/tTreg/Tconv cell was lowered to allow T cell contact with an individual DC and to interact for 15 s before being moved upwards, until two cells were separated completely. The force curves were acquired. The process was then repeated. For each SCFS experiment, a pair of TâDC was used to generate force readings from each up and down cycle over a period of several minutes, a minimum of 14 force curves were collected in each T-DC pair. In all experiments, at least three such pairs were used for each condition. The force curves were further processed using the JPK image processing software.</p>

<p>This study revealed that one of the mechanisms for iTreg (induced-Treg) lineage instability upon restimulation is through sustained store-operated calcium entry (SOCE), which activates transcription factor NFAT and promotes changes in chromatin accessibility to activated T cell-related genes. The authors revealed that, unlike thymus-derived Tregs (tTreg) with blunted calcium signaling and NFAT activation, iTregs respond to TCR restimulation with fully activated SOCE and NFAT similar to activated conventional T cells. Activated NFAT binds to open chromatin regions in genes related to T helper cells, increases their expression, and leads to the instability of iTreg cells. On the other hand, inhibition of the SOCE/NFAT pathway by chemical inhibitors could partially rescue the loss of Foxp3 expression in iTreg upon restimulation. The conclusion of the study is unexpected since previous studies showed that NFAT is required for Foxp3 induction and iTreg differentiation (Tone Y et al, Nat Immunol. 2008, PMID: 18157133; Vaeth M et al, PNAS, 2012, PMID: 22991461). Additionally, Foxp3 interacts with NFAT to control Treg function (Wu Y et al, Cell, 2006, PMID: 16873067). The data presented in this study demonstrated the complex role NFAT plays in the generation and stability of iTreg cells.</p>
<p>Several concerns are raised from the current study.</p>
<p>
1. Previous studies showed that iTregs generated in vitro from culturing naÃ¯ve T cells with TGF-b are intrinsically unstable and prone to losing Foxp3 expression due to lack of DNA demethylation in the enhancer region of the Foxp3 locus (Polansky JK et al, Eur J Immunol., 2008, PMID: 18493985). It is known that removing TGF-b from the culture media leads to rapid loss of Foxp3 expression. In the current study, TGF-b was not added to the media during iTreg restimulation, therefore, the primary cause for iTreg instability should be the lack of the positive signal provided by TGF-b. NFAT signal is secondary at best in this culturing condition.</p>
<p>2. It is not clear whether the NFAT pathway is unique in accelerating the loss of Foxp3 expression upon iTreg restimulation. It is also possible that enhancing T cell activation in general could promote iTreg instability. The authors could explore blocking T cell activation by inhibiting other critical pathways, such as NF-kb and c-Jun/c-Fos, to see if a similar effect could be achieved compared to CsA treatment.</p>
<p>3. The authors linked chromatin accessibility and increased expression of T helper cell genes to the loss of Foxp3 expression and iTreg instability. However, it is not clear how the former can lead to the latter. It is also not clear whether NFAT binds directly to the Foxp3 locus in the restimulated iTregs and inhibits Foxp3 expression.</p>

<p>The phenotypic instability of in vitro-induced Treg cells (iTregs) has been discussed for a long time, mainly in the context of the epigenetic landscape of Treg-signature genes; e.g. Treg-specifically CpG-hypomethylated Foxp3 CNS2 enhancer region. However, it has been insufficiently understood the upstream molecular mechanisms, the particularity of intracellular signaling of natural Treg cells, and how they connect to stable/unstable suppressive function.</p>
<p>Huiyun Lv et al. addressed the issue of phenotypic instability of in vitro-induced regulatory T cells (iTregs), which is a different point from the physiological natural Treg cells and an obstacle to the therapeutic use of iTreg cells. The authors focused on the difference between iTreg and nTreg cells from the perspective of their control of store-operated calcium entry (SOCE)-mediated cellular signaling, and they clearly showed that the sustained SOCE signaling in iTreg and nTreg cells led to phenotypic instability. Moreover, the authors pointed the correlation between the incomplete conversion of chromatin configuration and the NFAT-mediated control of effector-type gene expression profile in iTreg cells. These findings potentially cultivate our understanding of the cellular identity of regulatory T cells and may shed light on the therapeutic use of Treg cells in many clinical contexts.</p>
<p>The authors demonstrated the biological contribution of Ca2+ signaling with the variable methods, which ensure the reliability of the results and the claims of the authors. iTreg cells sustained SOCE-signaling upon stimulation while natural Treg cells had lower strength and shorter duration of SOCE-signaling. The result was consistent with the previously-proposed concept; a certain range of optimal strength and duration of TCR-signaling shape the Treg generation and maintenance, and it provides us with further in-depth mechanistic understanding.</p>
<p>In the later section, authors found the incomplete installment of Treg-type open chromatin landscape in some effector/helper function-related gene loci in iTreg cells. These findings propose the significance to focus on not only the &quot;Treg&quot;-associated gene loci but also &quot;Teffector-ness&quot;-associated regions to determine the Treg conversion at epigenetic level.</p>
<p>Limitations and weaknesses;</p>
<p>
(1) Some concerns about data processing and statistic analysis.</p>
<p>
The authors did not provide sufficient information on statistical data analysis; e.g. lack of detailed descriptions about</p>
<p>
-the precise numbers of technical/biological replicates of each experiment</p>
<p>
-the method of how the authors analyze data of multiple comparisons... Student t-test alone is generally insufficient to compare multiple groups; e.g. figure 1.</p>
<p>
These inappropriate data handlings are ruining the evidence level of the precious findings.</p>
<p>(2) Untransparent data production; e.g. the method of Motif enrichment analysis was not provided.</p>
<p>
Thus, we should wait for the author's correction to fully evaluate the significance and reliability of the present study.</p>
<p>(3) Lack of evidence in human cells.</p>
<p>
I wonder whether human PBMC-derived iTreg cells are similarly regulated.</p>
<p>(4) NFAT regulation did not explain all of the differences between iTregs and nTregs, as the authors mentioned as a limitation.</p>
<p>
Also, it is still an open question whether NFAT can directly modulate the chromatin configuration on the effector-type gene loci, or whether NFAT exploits pre-existing open chromatin due to the incomplete conversion of Treg-type chromatin landscape in iTreg cells. The authors did not fully demonstrate that the distinct pattern of chromatin regional accessibility found in iTreg cells is the direct cause of an effector-type gene expression.</p>
