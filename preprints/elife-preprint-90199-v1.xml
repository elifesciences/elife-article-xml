<title>Abstract</title><p>Each year, hundreds of millions of people are infected with arboviruses such as dengue, yellow fever, chikungunya, and Zika, which are all primarily spread by the notorious mosquito <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic>. Traditional control measures have proven insufficient, necessitating innovations. In response, here we generate a next generation CRISPR-based precision-guided sterile insect technique (pgSIT) for <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> that disrupts genes essential for sex determination and fertility, producing predominantly sterile males that can be deployed at any life stage. Using mathematical models and empirical testing, we demonstrate that released pgSIT males can effectively compete with, suppress, and eliminate caged mosquito populations. This versatile species-specific platform has the potential for field deployment to control wild populations, safely curtailing disease transmission.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The mosquito <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> is the principal vector of several deadly viruses, including dengue, yellow fever, chikungunya, and Zika. Unfortunately, its geographic spread has been exacerbated by climate change, global trade, and its preference for anthropogenic habitats, such that 3.9 billion people are presently at risk<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. Traditionally, mosquito control has been achieved through insecticides, though developing resistances have rendered them less effective. Moreover, insecticides are harmful to non-target species, such as insect pollinators, and direct exposure can be dangerous for humans and pets <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. Alternative integrated approaches for mosquito control include preventative measures designed to reduce mosquito populations through habitat reduction or larval predation, though these can also be impractical or introduce invasive species. Notwithstanding, the continuous expansion of this invasive mosquito species demonstrates that current measures are insufficient.</p>
<p>Alternative genetic biological approaches have been developed to control specific species, including the sterile insect technique (SIT) and the <italic>Wolbachia-</italic>mediated incompatible insect technique (<italic>W</italic>IIT)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. Here, radiation-sterilized males (♂’s), or ♂’s harboring <italic>Wolbachia</italic>, are repeatedly mass released to mate with wild females (♀’s) which typically mate only once, thereby reducing mosquito populations over time. However, high capital and operational costs limit the broad application of SIT and <italic>W</italic>IIT for mosquito control, with major challenges including the efficient removal of ♀ mosquitoes and cost-effective deployment of only ♂’s<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. An alternative genetic approach, ♀-specific release of insects carrying a dominant lethal gene (fsRIDL), can genetically sex-sort ♀’s, and can be released as eggs. However, fsRIDL relies on the broad-spectrum antibiotic tetracycline for mass-rearing, affecting the fitness and competitiveness of released ♂’s<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>. Additionally, fsRIDL ♂’s are fertile and pass <italic>fsRIDL</italic> to wildtype (WT) ♂ progeny, so the transgene will linger in the environment, which may not be ideal.</p>
<p>Suggested as a potent, yet controversial, possible alternative population control approach, gene drives leverage the CRISPR based precise DNA cutting and repair to spread into populations. Two types of gene drives have been engineered: the spread of suppression drives collapses a population, whereas modification drives spread cargo genes that can potentially block the chain of transmission of a targeted disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">14</xref></sup>. However, gene drives come with safety concerns and debilitating technical challenges that can limit their efficacy, including errors in DNA repair and the natural selection of viable repair mistakes that are resistant to the gene drive (i.e. resistant alleles). To address some of the challenges with gene drives, precision-guided SIT (pgSIT) also leverages CRISPR to instead produce sterile males that should not be affected by resistant alleles. pgSIT works by simultaneously disrupting genes essential for ♀ viability and ♂ fertility during development to genetically generate sex-sorted and viable sterilized ♂’s <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. Notably, pgSIT avoids many of the gene-drive safety concerns by separating the CRISPR components into binary strains—one expressing Cas9 and the other expressing multiple gRNA—that, when genetically crossed, produce pgSIT progeny ready for release. Previously, we showed that disrupting a ♀- specific flight muscle gene (fem-myo) induced a flightless ♀-specific phenotype in <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> ♀’s<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. However, this approach would still result in viable flightless transgenic ♀’s being released which may be less desirable than removing females altogether.</p>
<p>To further improve and build upon the system, we instead cause ♀ lethality, simplifying the process of generating pgSIT ♂’s for release. Our herein-developed next-generation pgSIT approach simultaneously disrupts three genes in <italic>Ae. aegypti— doublessex</italic> (<italic>dsx</italic>), <italic>intersex</italic> (<italic>ix</italic>), and <italic>β-Tubulin 85D</italic> (<italic>βTub</italic>)—to induce ♀ lethality, or ♀ masculinization, and near-complete ♂ sterility. We demonstrate that pgSIT ♂’s are competitive and multiple releases can suppress cage populations. Notably, mathematical modeling indicates that this technology can control insect populations effectively over a wide range of realistic performance parameters and fitness costs. Overall, this next-generation pgSIT approach provides a viable option for the release of sterile males, bringing the field significantly closer to deployable CRISPR-based vector control strategies. Additionally, we also develop a rapid diagnostic assay to detect pgSIT transgene presence that could be used alongside field tests. Taken together, we have demonstrated that pgSIT could be designed to target essential sex determination and fertility genes in <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> to produce sterilized males that can suppress and eliminate caged populations thereby providing an alternate system for controlling this deadly vector.</p>

<title>Disrupting sex-determination and fertility</title>
<p>To induce ♀-specific lethality and/or masculinization in <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic>, we targeted either the <italic>dsx</italic> (AAEL009114) or <italic>ix</italic> (AAEL010217) genes, both of which are associated with sex determination and differentiation in insects <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>. The <italic>dsx</italic> gene is located on chromosome 1R and is alternatively spliced to produce two ♀-specific (<italic>dsxF<sub>1</sub></italic> and <italic>dsxF<sub>2</sub></italic>) and one ♂-specific (<italic>dsxM</italic>) isoforms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. Exon 5b is retained in both ♀-specific <italic>dsxF<sub>1</sub></italic> and <italic>dsxF<sub>2</sub></italic> transcripts and is spliced out in the ♂-specific <italic>dsxM</italic> transcript. Therefore, to disrupt both ♀-specific <italic>dsx</italic> isoforms, we selected four gRNAs that target exon 5b (Supplementary Table 1) and assembled the pBac <italic>gRNA<sup>dsx</sup></italic> plasmid (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). The <italic>ix</italic> gene (AAEL010217) is located on chromosome 3L and is orthologous to the <italic>ix</italic> gene required for ♀-specific sexual differentiation in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>. While the <italic>D. melanogaster ix</italic> does not undergo sex-specific alternative splicing and is expressed in both sexes, <italic>ix</italic> interacts with <italic>dsxF</italic>, but not <italic>dsxM</italic>, resulting in ♀-specific activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>. To disrupt <italic>ix</italic>, we engineered a <italic>gRNA<sup>ix</sup></italic> cassette harboring two gRNAs targeting <italic>ix</italic> exon 1 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>, Supplementary Table 1). To determine the effects of targeting these genes, multiple separate <italic>gRNA<sup>dsx</sup></italic> and <italic>gRNA<sup>ix</sup></italic> strains were generated and assessed by crossing with <italic>Nup50-Cas9</italic> (hereafter, <italic>Cas9</italic>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. To explore potential effects of maternal Cas9 carryover, all genetic crosses were conducted reciprocally (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>). Remarkably, the disruption of either <italic>dsx</italic> or <italic>ix</italic> transformed all trans-hemizygous ♀’s into intersexes (⚥’s), independent of whether Cas9 was inherited from the mother (i.e., ♀Cas9), or father (i.e., ♂Cas9). The induced phenotypes were especially strong in <italic>gRNA<sup>dsx</sup>/+; Cas9/+</italic> ⚥’s, which exhibited multiple malformed morphological features, such as mutant maxillary palps, abnormal genitalia, and malformed ovaries (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>, <xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>, Supplementary Table 2). Notably, only ∼50% of <italic>gRNA<sup>dsx</sup>/+</italic>; <italic>Cas9/+</italic> ⚥’s were able to blood feed, producing very few hatchable eggs. While a similar fraction of <italic>gRNA<sup>ix</sup>/+</italic>; <italic>Cas9/+</italic> ⚥’s were able to blood feed, the fed ⚥’s laid hatchable eggs (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>, Supplementary Table 3). Sanger sequencing confirmed expected mutations at the <italic>dsx</italic> and <italic>ix</italic> loci (<xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>). Importantly, we did not observe abnormal morphological features in either <italic>gRNA<sup>dsx</sup>/+; Cas9/+</italic> ♂’s or <italic>gRNA<sup>ix</sup>/+; Cas9/+</italic> ♂’s, as neither their fecundity, ear anatomy, wing beat frequency (WBF), nor ♂ phonotactic behaviors were significantly affected suggesting that disrupting these genes results in ♀-specific consequences (<xref rid="figS3" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>, Supplementary Table 3). Taken together, these findings reveal that ♀-specific lethality and/or masculinization can be efficiently achieved by disrupting either <italic>dsx</italic> or <italic>ix</italic> genes and also validate the gRNA target sequences for ♀- specific disruption.</p>

<title>Multiplexed target gene disruption</title>
<p>To guide CRISPR-mediated disruption of multiple genes essential for ♀-specific viability and ♂-specific fertility, we engineered the <italic>gRNA<sup>dsx,ix,βTub</sup></italic> construct which combines the effective gRNAs described above. More specifically, this construct harbors six gRNAs: three gRNAs targeting the <italic>dsx</italic> exon 5b; one gRNA targeting the <italic>ix</italic> exon 1; and two gRNA targeting the <italic>β-Tubulin 85D</italic> (<italic>βTub</italic>, AAEL019894) exon 1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>, Supplementary Table 1). The <italic>βTub</italic> gene is specifically expressed in mosquito testes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup> and is essential for sperm maturation, elongation, and motility <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>. Three independent homozygous <italic>gRNA<sup>dsx,ix,βTub</sup></italic> strains were established and reciprocally crossed to the homozygous <italic>Cas9</italic> strain to measure survival, fitness, and fertility of generated pgSIT (i.e., trans-hemizygous) progeny (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B-C</xref>, <xref rid="figS4" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref>). To determine transgene integration sites, we performed genome sequencing of <italic>gRNA<sup>dsx,ix,βTub</sup>#1/Cas9</italic> (hereafter, <italic>gRNA<sup>dsx,ix,βTub</sup></italic>) and found that this strain harbored a single copy of the transgene inserted on chromosome 3 (<xref rid="figS5" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 5</xref>). Using these sequencing data, we also validated the presence of diverse mutations at the intended target sites (<xref rid="figS6" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 6</xref>). Moreover, RNA sequencing revealed a significant reduction in target gene expression and mutations in the target RNA sequences (Supplementary Figs. 7-10). These findings reveal that single copies of <italic>Cas9</italic> and <italic>gRNA<sup>dsx,ix,βTub</sup></italic>can induce mutagenesis at six separate DNA targets simultaneously, thereby providing desired pgSIT phenotypic redundancy for increased resilience.</p>

<title>pgSIT ♂’s are mostly sterile with normal longevity and mating ability</title>
<p>We found that ∼94% of the eclosed pgSIT mosquitoes were ♂’s due to the majority of the ⚥’s not surviving to adulthood (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>, Supplementary Table 4). Both <italic>pgSIT<sup>♀cas9</sup></italic> and <italic>pgSIT<sup>♂Cas9</sup></italic> ♂’s were also nearly completely sterile (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>, Supplementary Table 4).

<title>pgSIT ♂’s induce population suppression</title>
<p>To further explore whether pgSIT ♂’s are competitive enough to mate with WT ♀’s in the presence of WT ♂’s to suppress populations, we conducted multigenerational, population cage experiments. At each generation, adult <italic>pgSIT<sup>♀cas9</sup></italic>or <italic>pgSIT<sup>♂Cas9</sup></italic> and WT ♂ mosquitos were released into cages using several introduction frequencies (pgSIT:WT—1:1, 5:1, 10:1, 20:1, and 40:1; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref> and Supplementary Table 9). Remarkably, both <italic>pgSIT<sup>♀cas9</sup></italic> ♂ or <italic>pgSIT<sup>♂Cas9</sup></italic>♂ behaved similarly, and the high-release ratios (20:1, 40:1) eliminated all populations in five generations (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B-C</xref>). With lower release ratios of 10:1 and 5:1, we also observed significant suppression of the rates of laid and hatched eggs in the cages. No effect was observed in control cages harboring WT mosquitoes with only Cas9 or gRNA mosquitoes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B-C</xref> and Supplementary Table 9). To confirm the sterility of pgSIT ♂’s, hatched larvae were screened for the presence of transgenesis markers each generation. In only 3 out of 30 experimental cages, we scored some larvae harboring transgene markers, though this was very few, indicating that the majority of <italic>pgSIT</italic> ♂ were indeed sterile (Supplementary Table 9). These findings confirmed the ability of both generated <italic>pgSIT<sup>♀cas9</sup></italic> and <italic>pgSIT<sup>♂Cas9</sup></italic>♂’s to compete with WT ♂’s for mating with WT ♀’s to gradually suppress and eliminate targeted caged populations.</p>

<title>Theoretical performance of pgSIT in a wild population</title>
<p>To explore the effectiveness of non-optimal pgSIT gene disruption on population suppression outcomes, we simulated releases of pgSIT eggs into a population of 10,000 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> adults (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). Weekly releases of up to 500 pgSIT eggs (♀ and ♂) per wild-type adult (♀ and ♂) were simulated over 1-52 weeks. The scale of releases was chosen considering adult release ratios of 10:1 are common for sterile ♂ mosquito interventions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup> and ♀ <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> produce &gt;30 eggs per day in temperate climates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>. A preliminary sensitivity analysis was conducted to determine which parameters population suppression outcomes are most sensitive to (<xref rid="figS12" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 12</xref>). The analysis considered probability of elimination (the percentage of 60 stochastic simulations that result in <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> elimination) and window of protection (the time duration for which ≥50% of 60 stochastic simulations result in ≥90% suppression of the <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> population) as outcomes, and explored how these vary with number of releases, size of releases, release interval, gRNA cutting rate, Cas9 maternal deposition rate, pgSIT ♂ fertility and mating competitiveness, and pgSIT ♀ viability. Suppression outcomes were found to be most sensitive to release schedule parameters (number, size and interval of releases), ♂ fertility and ♀ viability. Model-predicted efficacy of pgSIT-induced population suppression was then explored in more detail as a function of these parameters through a series of simulations depicted in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>. Results from these simulations reveal that a window of protection exceeding two years (a common benchmark for interruption of disease transmission) is generally achieved for pgSIT ♀ viability between 0 (complete inviability) and 0.15, and pgSIT ♂ fertility between 0 (complete sterility) and 0.15, provided the release scheme exceeds ∼23 releases of ≥100 pgSIT eggs per wild adult (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>). Achieving a ≥90% probability of elimination places slightly tighter restrictions on ♀ viability and ♂ fertility - a safe ballpark being ♀ viability and ♂ fertility both in the range 0-0.10, given a release scheme of ∼26 releases of 250 pgSIT eggs per wild adult (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>).

<title>Mitigation tools for rapid transgene detection</title>
<p>Being able to rapidly identify transgenes in the environment in mixtures of captured mosquitoes will be important for field applications of genetic biocontrol tools. While PCR based tests do exist, these may be difficult to implement in the field. Therefore, developing an assay with a simple readout would be desired. To generate a rapid assay for transgene detection that could be used alongside future pgSIT field trials, we adapted the sensitive enzymatic nucleic acid sequence reporter (SENSR)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup> to rapidly detect pgSIT DNA fragments in <italic>Cas9</italic> and <italic>gRNA<sup>dsx,ix,βTub</sup></italic>constructs in mosquitoes. In SENSR, the presence of transgenic sequences triggers the activation of the <italic>Ruminococcus flavefaciens</italic> CasRx/gRNA collateral activity that cleaves a quenched probe, resulting in a rapid fluorescent readout<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>. Multiple ratios of trans-hemizygous <italic>pgSIT</italic> to WT mosquitoes—0:1; 1:1; 1:5; 1:10; 1:25; 1:50— and a no template control (NTC) were used to challenge SENSR. We found that SENSR effectively detected transgenic sequences from both <italic>Cas9</italic> and <italic>gRNA<sup>dsx,ix,βTub</sup></italic>constructs even at the lowest dilution, and no signal was observed in the WT-only and NTC controls (<xref rid="figS13" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 13</xref>). Notably, in every tested ratio, SENSR rapidly detected the transgenic sequence, reaching the half maximum fluorescence (HMF) in less than 20 min (<xref rid="figS13" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 13B</xref>). Taken together, these results validated SENSR as a rapid and sensitive assay for detection of transgenic sequences in pools of mosquitoes which may be an instrumental tool for future field trials.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>To develop a robust and stable population control technology for addressing insect disease vectors, we engineered a next-generation pgSIT system that induced near complete ♀-specific lethality and ♂ sterility by simultaneously targeting the <italic>dsx, ix</italic>, and <italic>βTub</italic> genes. Our cage experiments indicate that releases of pgSIT ♂’s can induce robust population suppression and elimination, and mathematical models reinforce this finding. To support future field trials of this and other trangene-based technologies, we also developed a rapid and sensitive method, SENSR, for identifying pgSIT transgenes.</p>
<p>There were several interesting and unexpected findings in our pgSIT mosquitoes, the main one being that induced ⚥’s did not blood feed normally. In fact, we noticed that ⚥’s had difficulty in penetrating the skin of the mouse, as the proboscis would often bend while probing. Moreover, in rare instances where they could initiate blood feeding, the pgSIT ⚥’s took longer to feed, suggesting that perhaps the disruption of sex determination genes also altered the mechanics of blood feeding. Furthermore, it also appears that the ⚥’s had difficulty in finding hosts, indicting that our induced disruptions may also affect the behavior of host-seeking, but this remains to be explored. This reduction in host-seeking behavior may also be attributed to the mutant maxillary palps, since maxillary palps are known to play a major role in host detection <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>. Taken together, these observations indicate a potentially more widespread affect of sex determination genes than previously expected, though regardless, the surviving pgSIT ⚥’s are compromised in many ways and will be unlikely to survive in the wild.</p>
<p>Overall, the released pgSIT males were competitive in our cage populations, as repeated releases resulted in population elimination at several introduction frequencies. That said, we did observe some limitations. Firstly, we determined that pgSIT males were not 100% sterile, with an estimated ∼1% still producing some progeny. This may stem from using fewer gRNAs to target <italic>βTub,</italic> as our previous system that saw complete sterility used four gRNAs while here we used only two<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. That said, it would not be difficult to build new strains that harbor additional gRNAs targeting <italic>βTub</italic> or other genes important for male fertility to ensure sterility is achieved. Secondly, we also noticed some reduced fitness parameters when Cas9 was inherited maternally, which may result from an overabundance of Cas9 present in the egg <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>. That said, these maternal fitness effects can be avoided by ensuring Cas9 is inherited paternally as pgSIT phenotypes can be achieved when Cas9 is inherited from either the father or mother. Moreover, the longevity was not significantly altered, and released pgSIT males still performed well in the population cages, which indicates that these fitness costs and lack of complete male sterility could be tolerated for population suppression.</p>
<p>Even in the presence of pgSIT construct imperfections, our mathematical modeling showed that population suppression is very promising, both in terms of the potential to eliminate a mosquito population, or to suppress it to an extent that would largely interrupt disease transmission. Our models determined that having ♀ viability and ♂ fertility both in the range 0-10% provides a reasonable target product profile for pgSIT - criteria that the construct described in this study easily satisfies. Previously published analyses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup> have also shown fitness costs associated with pgSIT constructs are well-tolerated in the range 0-25%. Overall, our results indicate that perfection is not required for an effective pgSIT system, though improvements to the presented and other systems could allow for reduced introduction ratios.</p>
<p>Before a possible field deployment, there are still several considerations that must be addressed for this pgSIT system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>. Firstly, our herein-presented system requires a genetic cross to produce the releasable insects, similarly to previous pgSIT systems<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup> that will require a scalable genetic sexing system. While sophisticated mechanical systems that exploit sex-specific morphological differences have been generated in previous work<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup> and are available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.senecio-robotics.com">www.senecio-robotics.com</ext-link>, these approaches may be cost prohibitive. Therefore, there exists a need to develop inexpensive and scalable genetic sexing systems that could be combined with pgSIT to eliminate its reliance on mechanical adult sexing approaches. Alternatively, if a temperature inducible Cas9 strain was generated in <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> then it may be possible to generate a temperature inducible pgSIT (TI-pgSIT) system as was done previously <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup> and this would alleviate the need for an integrated genetic sexing approach. Secondly, although pgSIT is self-limiting and inherently safe, it does require genetic modification, so regulatory authorizations will be necessary prior to implementation. Despite this, we anticipate that obtaining such authorizations will not be insurmountable. We would expect pgSIT to be regulated similarly to Oxitec’s RIDL technology<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>, which has already been successfully deployed in numerous locations, including the United States.</p>
<p>Altogether, we demonstrate that removing females by disrupting sex determinate genes is possible with pgSIT, which can inform the development of future such systems in related species. The self-limiting nature of pgSIT offers a controllable alternative to technologies such as gene drives that will persist and uncontrollably spread in the environment. Moving forward, pgSIT could offer an efficient, scalable, and environmentally friendly next-generation technology for controlling wild mosquito populations, leading to widespread prevention of human disease transmission.</p>

Then, the generated trans-hemizygous mosquitoes were mated to WT mosquitoes of the opposite sex, and numbers of laid and hatched eggs were scored to measure the fecundity. Multiple genetic control crosses were also performed for comparisons: WT ♂ 𝗑 WT ♀; WT ♂ 𝗑 <italic>Cas9</italic> ♀; <italic>Cas9</italic> ♂ 𝗑 WT ♀; <italic>gRNA</italic> ♂ 𝗑 <italic>Cas9</italic> ♀; <italic>gRNA</italic> ♀ 𝗑 <italic>Cas9</italic> ♂; <italic>gRNA</italic> ♀ 𝗑 WT ♂; and <italic>gRNA</italic> ♂ 𝗑 WT ♀. For the genetic cross, adult mosquitoes were allowed to mate in a cage for 4–5 days, then blood meals were provided, and eggs were collected and hatched. To calculate the normalized percentage of laid eggs per ♀ (e.i. fecundity), the number of laid eggs per ♀ for each genotype replicate was divided by the maximum number of laid eggs per ♀ (Supplementary Table 4). The percentage of egg hatching (i.e. fertility) was estimated by dividing the number of laid eggs by the number of hatched eggs. Egg-to-adult survival ratios were the number of laid eggs divided by the total number of eclosed adults. Larvae-to-adult survival rates were calculated by dividing the number of eclosed adults by the number of larvae. Pupae- adult survival rates were calculated by dividing the number of pupae by the number of eclosed adults. Blood feeding rates were calculated by dividing the number of blood-fed ♀’s or ⚥’s by the total number of ♀ or ⚥’s. Trans-hemizygous ⚥’s had many morphological features visibly different from those of WT ♀’s. To assess differences in external and internal anatomical structures, we dissected twenty trans-hemizygous and control mosquitoes for each genotype and sex (♂, ♀ and ⚥) in 1% PBS buffer and imaged structures on the Leica M165FC fluorescent stereomicroscope equipped with a Leica DMC4500 color camera. The measurements were performed using Leica Application Suite X (LAS X by Leica Microsystems) on the acquired images (Supplementary Table 2).</p>

<p>To confirm that the ♀ lethality or transformation correlated with specific mutations at the target loci, <italic>dsx</italic> and <italic>ix</italic> gRNA targets were PCR amplified from the genomic DNA extracted from trans-hemizygous and control mosquitoes. PCR amplicons were purified directly or gel purified using Zymoclean Gel DNA Recovery Kit (Zymo Research Cat. #D4007) and then Sanger sequenced. Presence of induced mutations were inferred as precipitous drops in sequence read quality by analyzing base peak chromatograms (<xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>). The primers used for PCR and sequencing, including gRNA target sequences, are listed in Supplementary Table 1.

Then, one anesthetized mouse (similar size and weight) was put into each cage for 20 minutes (from 9:00 am to 9:20 am) daily for five days, and two times were recorded for each mosquito ♀ or ⚥. First, the ‘time to bite’ is the time interval between a mouse placed in a cage and ♀/⚥ landing on the mouse. Second, the ‘feeding time’ is the duration of blood feeding (Supplementary Table 5). When individual ♀/⚥’s finished blood feeding they were removed from the cage, while unfed ♀/⚥’s were kept in the cage and the blood feeding was repeated the next day. In total, each ♀/⚥ had 6000 seconds to initiate bite and feed during 5 days. To assess whether distance affects blood feeding of <italic>pgSIT</italic> ⚥’s, we conducted the experiment in two sizes of cages: small (24.5 X 24.5 X 24.5 cm) and large (60 X 60 X 60 cm).

<p>To assess the competitiveness of pgSIT ♂’s, we performed discrete non-overlapping multigenerational population cage trials as described in our previous study <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. Briefly, 3/4-day-old mature WT adult ♂’s were released along with mature (3/4 days old) pgSIT adult ♂’s at release ratios (pgSIT: WT): 1:1 (50:50), 5:1 (250:50), 10:1 (500:50), 20:1 (1000:50), and 40:1 (2000:50), with three biological replicates for each release ratio (15 cages total). One hour later, 50 mature (3/4 days old) WT adult ♀’s were released into each cage. All adults were allowed to mate for 2 days. ♀’s were then blood fed and eggs were collected. Eggs were counted and stored for four days to allow full embryonic development. Then, 100 eggs were randomly selected, hatched, and reared to the pupal stage, and the pupae were separated into ♂ and ♀ groups and transferred to separate cages. Three days post eclosion, ratios (pgSIT: WT) of 50 (1:1), 250 (5:1), 500 (10:1), 1000 (20:1), and 2000 (40:1) age-matched pgSIT mature ♂ adults were caged with these mature ♂’s from 100 selected eggs. One hour later, mature ♀’s from 100 selected eggs were transferred into each cage. All adults were allowed to mate for 2 days. ♀’s were blood fed, and eggs were collected. Eggs were counted and stored for 4 days to allow full embryonic development.

<title>Mathematical modeling</title>
<p>To model the expected performance of pgSIT at suppressing and eliminating local <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> populations, we used the MGDrivE simulation framework<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup>. This framework models the egg, larval, pupal, and adult mosquito life stages with overlapping generations, larval mortality increasing with larval density, and a mating structure in which ♀’s retain the genetic material of the adult ♂ with whom they mate for the duration of their adult lifespan. The inheritance pattern of the pgSIT system was modeled within the inheritance module of MGDrivE. This module includes parameters for ♀ pupatory success (as a proxy for viability), and ♂ fertility and mating competitiveness. We simulated a randomly-mixing <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> population of 10,000 adults and implemented the stochastic version of MGDrivE to capture chance effects that are relevant to suppression and elimination scenarios. Density-independent mortality rates for juvenile life stages were calculated for consistency with the population growth rate in the absence of density-dependent mortality, and density-dependent mortality was applied to the larval stage following Deredec <italic>et al.</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></sup>. Sensitivity analyses were conducted with “window of protection” (mean duration for which the <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> population is suppressed by at least 90%), probability of <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> elimination, and reduction in cumulative potential for transmission as the outcomes, and model parameters sampled describing the construct (gRNA cutting rate and maternal deposition frequency), release scheme (number, size and frequency of releases), ♀ viability, and ♂ fertility and mating competitiveness. Model parameters were sampled according to a latin-hypercube scheme with 2<sup>16</sup> parameter sets and 20 repetitions per parameter set. Regression models were fitted to the sensitivity analysis data using multi-layered perceptrons as emulators of the main simulation in predicting the window of protection outcome. Subsequent simulations focused on the most sensitive parameters from the sensitivity analysis (those describing the release scheme, ♀ viability, and ♂ fertility) and were explored via factorial simulation design.

<title>Transgene detection method in mosquitoes</title>
<p>SENSR assays were performed as described previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref></sup> using a two-step nucleic acid detection protocol. Target sequences were first amplified in a 30 min isothermal preamplification reaction using recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA). RPA primers were designed to amplify 30 bp gRNA spacer complement regions flanked by 30 bp priming regions from the transgenic elements (<italic>Cas9</italic> coding sequence or <italic>gRNA</italic> scaffold for <italic>Cas9</italic> or <italic>gRNA<sup>dsx,ix,βTub</sup></italic> construct, respectively) while simultaneously incorporating a T7 promoter sequence and “GGG’’ into the 5′ end of the dsDNA gene fragment to increase transcription efficiency<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref></sup>. The RPA primer sequences and synthetic target sequences can be found in Supplementary Table 12. The RPA reaction was performed at 42°C for 30 min by using TwistAmp Basic (TwistDx #TABAS03KIT). The final conditions for the optimized (28.5% sample input) RPA protocol in a 10-μL reaction are as follows: 5.9 μL rehydration buffer (TwistDx), 0.35 μL primer mix (10 μM each), 0.5 μL MgOAc (280 mM), and 50 ng of genomic DNA. The RPA reaction was then transferred to a second reaction, termed the Cas Cleavage Reaction (CCR), which contained a T7 polymerase and the CasRx ribonucleoprotein.

Experiments were immediately run on a LightCycler 96 (Roche #05815916001) at 37°C for 60 min with the following acquisition protocol: 5 sec acquisition followed by 5 sec incubation for the first 15 min, followed by 5 sec acquisition and 55 sec incubation for up to 45 min. Fluorescence readouts were analyzed by calculating the background-subtracted fluorescence of each timepoint and by subtracting the initial fluorescence value from the final value. Statistical significance was calculated using a one-way ANOVA followed by specified multiple comparison tests (n = 4). The detection speed of each gRNA was calculated from the Half-Maximum Fluorescence (HMF) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref></sup>.

These three outcomes were evaluated for several parameters - number of releases, size of releases (as a proportion of the number of wild adults in the environment), release interval (in days), gRNA cutting rate, Cas9 maternal deposition rate, male fertility, male mating competitiveness (relative to wild-type males), and female viability. Population suppression outcomes are most sensitive to release schedule parameters (number, size and interval of releases), male fertility and female viability. <bold>B</bold> Statistical sensitivity analysis metrics on the simulated data are compared to importance metrics for surrogate models. For the first-order statistical sensitivity analysis, we used Delta<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref></sup>, Fourier Amplitude Sensitivity Test (FAST)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref></sup>, and High-Dimensional Model Representation (HDMR)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref></sup>; whilst for the emulators we used Permutation feature importance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref></sup>, and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref></sup>.

<p>This paper builds on a method, previously conceptualized and validated, of genetic control for insect populations. The method, called pgSIT, uses integrated CRISPR-Cas9 based constructs to generate, in certain combinations of genotypes, mutations that cause both male sterility and female inviability. Release of such genotypes in sufficiently large numbers can lead to an inundation of a local insect population with sterile males and this can lead to localised population suppression, which represents an <bold>important</bold> method of control for problematic insect populations. The data are <bold>convincing</bold> and will be of interest to anyone working on vector control strategies.</p>

<p>Precision guided sterile insect technology (pgSIT) is a means of mosquito vector control that aims to simultaneously kill females while generating sterile males for field release. These sterile males are expected to mate with 'wild' females resulting in very few eggs being laid or low hatching rates. Repeated releases are expected to result in the suppression of the mosquito population. This method avoids cumbersome sex-sorting while generating the sterile males. Importantly, until release, the two genetic elements that bring about female lethality and male sterility - the Cas9 and the gRNA carrying mosquitoes - are maintained as separate lines. They are crossed only prior to release, and therefore, this approach is considered to be more safe than gene drives.</p>
<p>The authors had made a version of this pgSIT in their 2021 paper where they targeted *β-Tubulin 85D*, which is only expressed in the male testes and its loss-of-function results in male sterility. In that pgSIT, they did not have female lethality, but generated flightless females by simultaneously targeted *myosin heavy chain,* which is expressed only in the female wings. Here the authors argue, that the survival of females is not ideal, and so modify their 2021 approach to achieve female lethality/sterility.</p>
<p>To do this, they target two genes - the female specific isoform of Dsx and intersex. They use multiple gRNAs against these genes and validate their ability to cause female lethality/sterility. Having verified that these do indeed affect female fertility, they combine gRNAs against Dsx and ix to generate female lethality/sterility and use *β-Tubulin 85D* to generate male sterility (previously validated). When these gRNA mosquitoes are crossed to Cas9 and the progeny crossed to WT (the set-up for pgSIT), they find that very few eggs are laid, larval death is high, and what emerges are males or intersex progeny that are sterile.</p>
<p>As this is the requirement for pgSIT, the authors then test if it is able to induce population suppression. To do this, they conduct cage trials and find that only when they use 20:1 or 40:1 ratio of pgSIT:WT cages, does the population crash in 4-5 generations. They model this pgSIT's ability to suppress a population in the wild. Unfortunately, I was not able to assess what parameters from their pgSIT were used in the model and therefore the predicted efficacy of their pgSIT, (though the range of 0-.1 is not great, given that the assessment is between 0-0.15).</p>
<p>Finally, they also develop a SENSR with a rapid fluorescence read-out for detecting the transgene in the field. They show that this sensor is specific and sensitive, detecting low copy numbers of the transgene. This would be important for monitoring any release.</p>
<p>Overall, the data are clear and well presented. The manuscript is well written (albeit likely dense for the uninitiated!). I had concerns about the efficacy of generating the pgSIT animals - the overall number of eggs hatched from the gRNA (X) Cas9 cross appears to be low, therefore, very large numbers of parental animals would have to be reared and crossed to obtain enough sterile males for the SIT. In addition to this, I was concerned about the intersex progeny that can blood-feed. These could potentially contribute to the population and it would be useful to see the data that suggest that these numbers are low and the animals will not be competent in the field.</p>

<p>This is a thorough and convincing body of work that represents an incremental but significant improvement on iterations of this method of CRISPR-based Sterile Insect Technique ('pgSIT'). In this version, compared to previous, the authors target more genes than previously, in order to induce both female inviability (targeting the genes intersex and doublesex, compared to fem-myo previously) and male sterility (targeting a beta-tubulin, as previously in the release generation.</p>
<p>
The characterization of the lines is extensive and this data will be useful to the field. However, what is lacking is some context as to how this formulation compares to the previous iteration. Mention is made of the possible advantage of removing most females, compared to just making them flightless (as previously) but there is no direct comparison, either experimental, or theoretical i.e. imputing the life history traits into a model. For me this is a weakness, yet easily addressed. In a similar vein, much is made in alluding to the 'safety concerns of gene drive' and how this is a more palatable half-way house, just because it has CRISPR component within it; it is not. It would be much more sensible, and more informative, to compare this pgSIT technology to RIDL (release of insects carrying a dominant lethal), which is essentially a transgene-based version of the Sterile Insect Technique, as is the work presented here.</p>
<p>The authors achieve impressive results and show that these strains, under a scenario of high levels of release ratios compared to WT, could achieve significant local suppression of mosquito populations. The sensitivity analysis that examines the effect of changing different biological or release parameters is well performed and very informative.</p>
<p>The authors are honest in acknowledging that there are still challenges in bringing this to field release, namely in developing sexing strains and optimizing release strategies - a question I have here is how to actually release eggs, and could variability in the efficiency of this aspect be modelled in the sensitivity analysis? It seems to me like this could be a challenge and inherently very variable.</p>

<p>Summary and Strengths:</p>
<p>The manuscript by Li et al. presents an elegant application of sterile insect technology (pgSIT) utilizing a CRISPR-Cas9 system to suppress mosquito vector populations. The pgSIT technique outlined in this paper employs a binary system where Cas9 and gRNA are conjoined in experimental crosses to yield sterile male mosquitoes. Employing a multiplexed strategy, the authors combine multiple gRNA to concurrently target various genes within a single locus. This approach successfully showcases the disruption of three distinct genes at different genomic positions, resulting in the creation of highly effective sterile mosquitoes for population control. The pioneering work of the Akbari lab has been instrumental in developing this technology, previously demonstrating its efficacy in Drosophila and Aedes aegypti.</p>
<p>By targeting the female-specific splice isoform (exon-5) of doublesex in conjunction with intersex and β-tubulin, the researchers induce female lethality, leading to a predominance of sterile male mosquitoes. This innovation is particularly noteworthy as the deployment of sterile mosquitoes on a large scale typically requires substantial investment in sex sorting. However, this study circumvents this challenge through genetic manipulation.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>One notable concern arising from this manuscript pertains to the absence of data regarding the potential off-target effects of the gRNA. Given the utilization of multiple gRNA, the risk of unintended mutations in non-target areas of the genome increases. With around 1% of males still capable of producing fertile offspring, understanding the frequency of unintended genome targeting becomes crucial. Such mutations could potentially become fixed within the natural population.</p>
<p>
The experiments are well-conceived, featuring suitable controls and repeated trials to yield statistically significant data. However, a primary issue with the manuscript lies in its data presentation. The authors' graphical representations are intricate and demand considerable attention to discern the nuances, especially due to the striking similarity between the symbols representing different genotypes. As it stands, the manuscript primarily caters to experts within the field, thereby warranting improvements in data visualization for broader comprehension.</p>
