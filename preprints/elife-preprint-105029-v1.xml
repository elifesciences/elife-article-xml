<title>Abstract</title><p>Structural colors (SC), generated by light interacting with nanostructured materials, is responsible for the brightest and most vivid coloration in nature. Despite being widespread within the tree of life, there is little knowledge of the genes involved. Partial exceptions are some <italic>Flavobacteriia</italic> in which genes involved in a number of pathways, including gliding motility and polysaccharide metabolism, have been linked to SC. A previous genomic analysis of SC and non-SC bacteria suggested that the pterin pathway is involved in the organization of bacteria to form SC. Thus here, we focus on the <italic>moe</italic>A molybdopterin molybdenum transferase. When this gene was deleted from <italic>Flavobacterium</italic> IR1, the knock-out mutant showed a strong blue shift in SC of the colony, different from the green SC of the wild-type. The <italic>moe</italic>A mutant showed a particularly strong blue shift when grown on kappa-carrageenan and was upregulated for starch degradation. To further analyze the molecular changes, proteomic analysis was performed, showing the upregulation of various polysaccharide utilization loci, which supported the link between <italic>moe</italic>A and polysaccharide metabolism in SC. Overall, we demonstrated that single-gene mutations could change the optical properties of bacterial SC, which is unprecedented when compared to multicellular organisms where structural color is the result of several genes and can not yet be addressed genetically.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Structural color (SC) is the result of the interaction of light with nanoscale structures, causing selective, angle-dependent light reflectance, an optical mechanism distinct from pigmentation which is a property of differential light reflection in molecules. This phenomenon can have a bright, metallic and iridescent appearance, where the color seen is often highly dependent on viewing and illumination angles. SC has been reported in many eukaryotes, including vertebrates, invertebrates, plants, and <italic>Myxomycota</italic>, as well as in bacteria, but not in <italic>Eumycota</italic> or <italic>Archaea</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Brodie et al., 2021</xref>). Among bacteria, SC from colonies of the phylum Bacteroidetes is the best characterized (Kientz et al., 2012b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Kientz et al.,, 2016</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Johansen et al., 2018</xref>). SC in bacteria results from the periodic organization of the rod-shaped cells packed in a regular hexagonal lattice, forming a two-dimensional photonic crystal that reflects light (Scherte et al., 2020). Interestingly, the ecological role of bacterial SC is yet to be determined. Hypotheses point at predation (Hamidjaja et al., 2019) and polysaccharide metabolism optimization (van der Kerkhof et al., 2022), but further research is needed to elucidate its biological significance.</p>
<p>Information on genes and pathways involved in bacterial SC is limited but growing. Transposon mutagenesis suggests the involvement of cellular functions including the stringent response, plant metabolite modification, carbohydrate metabolism, and Bacteroidetes-specific gliding motility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Johansen et al., 2018</xref>). A recent bioinformatic study has shown the possible link of some metabolic pathways to bacterial SC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Zomer et al., 2024</xref>). In <italic>Flavobacterium</italic> iridescence species 1 (IR1), SC has been linked to interactions with microalgae, particularly through the metabolism of algal polysaccharides such as kappa-carrageenan and fucoidan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Johansen et al., 2018</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">van de Kerkhof et al., 2022</xref>). IR1’s colony organization, which underlies SC, may play a role in interbacterial competition, such as predation, but this has no obvious link to the photonic properties of the bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Hamidjaja et al., 2020</xref>).</p>
<p>A bioinformatic analysis of 117 bacterial genomes (87 with SC and 30 without) identified genes potentially involved in SC by comparing gene presence/absence, providing a SC-score. By this method, pterin pathway genes were strongly predicted to be involved in SC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Zomer et al., 2024</xref>). Pterins mainly work as enzyme cofactors in various functions, such as aerobic/anaerobic metabolism and detoxification. In eukaryotes, pterins contribute to pigmentary colors, such as in the scale structures of pierid butterfly wings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Wijnen et al., 2007</xref>), and appear in insects, fish, amphibians, and reptiles (Daubner et al., 2018). While pigment coloration is different from SC, structurally organized pterins can function as refractive index dopants (Wilts et al., 2016; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Sai et al., 2023</xref>) and function in UV protection, phototaxis, and intracellular signaling (Feirer et al., 2017).</p>
<p>We focused on one specific pterin, the molybdenum cofactor (MoCo), due to its predicted involvement in bacterial SC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Zomer et al., 2024</xref>). MoCo is a cofactor in a group of enzymes known as molybdoenzymes which are key enzymes in nitrogen, purine, and sulfur metabolism. These enzymes in bacteria fall into three families: xanthine oxidases, dimethyl sulfoxide reductases, and sulphite oxidases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Wootton et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Zhang and Gladyshev 2008</xref>). To study the link between MoCo and SC, we use IR1 as a model organism for bacterial SC due to the availability of genome engineering tools and its intense coloration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Johansen et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Patinios et al., 2021</xref>). Using the SIBR-Cas (Self-splicing Intron- Based Riboswitch-Cas) genome engineering tool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Patinios et al., 2021</xref>), we deleted the molybdopterin molybdenum transferase <italic>moe</italic>A gene, one of the most important genes for predicting bacterial SC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Zomer et al., 2024</xref>), as its protein is crucial in the final MoCo pathway reaction.</p>

<title>Bioinformatics analysis of the molybdopterin pathway operon in <italic>Flavobacterium</italic> IR1</title>
<p>Synteny and homology of the proteins related to SC were visualized with gggenomes 1.0.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Hackl et al., 2024</xref>) in RStudio 1.1.456. First, sequences of genomes and SC proteins were obtained from a previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Zomer et al., 2024</xref>). Proteins were predicted in the genomes with Prodigal 2.6.3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Hyatt et al., 2010</xref>). Proteins of interest were matched with BLAST 2.14.0+ blastp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Altschul et al., 1990</xref>) against Prodigal’s predicted proteins to find genomic coordinates. Operon start coordinate matches the start of the first gene of the putative operon and operon end coordinate matches the end of the last gene of the putative operon. Python 3.12.4 and jupyter notebook 7.2.1 were used to adapt file formats and create objects compatible to gggenomes. The corresponding phylogenetic tree was made from aligned 16S rRNA genes using Barrnap 0.9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Seemann 2024</xref>), BEDtools 2.31.0 getfasta (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Quinlan et al 2010</xref>), MAFFT 7.505 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Katoh et al., 2013</xref>), iqtree v1.6.2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Minh et al., 2020</xref>) and iToL online v6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Letunic and Bork, 2024</xref>). The final figure containing synteny, homology, and the tree was done in Inkscape 1.3.2. The tutorial and scripts for reproducing the figure were stored in a GitHub repository: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/MGXlab/genes_synteny">https://github.com/MGXlab/genes_synteny</ext-link>.

<title>Bacterial strains and growth conditions</title>
<p>Bacteria strains used in this study are described in <xref rid="tbls1" ref-type="table">Table S1</xref>. <italic>Flavobacterium</italic> iridescence species 1 (IR1) was the target strain used in this project. IR1 was grown in Artificial Sea Water (ASW) medium composed of 5g·L<sup>-1</sup> peptone (Sigma-Aldrich), 1g·L<sup>-1</sup> yeast extract (Sigma-Aldrich), and 10g·L<sup>-1</sup> sea salt (Lima), at 25°C and grown in an orbital incubator at 200rpm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Johansen et al., 2018</xref>). <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> DH5α (New England Biolab, NEB) was used for general plasmid propagation and standard molecular techniques. <italic>E. coli</italic> was grown in Luria-Bertani (LB) medium composed of 10g·L<sup>-1</sup> tryptone (Sigma-Aldrich), 5g·L<sup>-1</sup> yeast extract, and 10g·L<sup>-1</sup> NaCl (Sigma-Aldrich), at 37°C shaken at 200rpm. IR1 was plated on ASW with 1% agar (Invitrogen) with or without 0.25g·L<sup>-1</sup> nigrosine (Sigma-Aldrich) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Johansen et al., 2018</xref>). <italic>E. coli</italic> was plated on LB medium containing 1.5% agar (Invitrogen). Media were supplemented with 50µg·mL<sup>-1</sup> spectinomycin (Sigma-Aldrich), 100µg·mL<sup>-1</sup> ampicillin or 200µg·mL<sup>-1</sup> erythromycin (Sigma-Aldrich) when necessary.

<title>Plasmid construction</title>
<p>All the plasmids used for SIBR-based gene knockout (KO) were constructed from pSIBR048 (<xref rid="tbls2" ref-type="table">Table S2</xref>) following the previously described protocol by Patinios and coworkers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Patinios et al., 2021</xref>). In brief, to introduce the <italic>moe</italic>A homologous arms (HA) and mediate the deletion of <italic>moe</italic>A, pSIBR048 was linearized using MluI (NEB) and the phosphorylated ends were removed using Shrimp Alkaline Phosphatase (NEB). 1500 bp HA corresponding upstream and downstream of <italic>moe</italic>A were amplified from the IR1 genome by PCR with Dream Taq DNA Polymerase (Thermo Fisher). The amplicons were resolved on 1% agarose (Eurogentec) electrophoresis gel and purified using GenElute PCR Clean-Up Kit (Sigma-Aldrich). The PCR products were introduced to the linearized pSIBR048 using NEBuilder HiFi DNA Assembly Master Mix (NEB), resulting in the pMoeA_NT. Following, the <italic>moe</italic>A targeting spacer was introduced in the pMoeA_S1 plasmid as previously described (Patinios et al., 2023). The DNA sequence of each newly created plasmid was verified by Sanger sequencing. Oligonucleotides used in this study are listed in <xref rid="tbls3" ref-type="table">Table S3</xref>.</p>

<p>Competent cells of <italic>E. coli</italic> DH5α, for chemical transformation, were prepared following the CaCl<sub>2</sub> method described by Sambrook (Sambrook et al., 1989). The cells were aliquoted ready to be used or stored at - 80°C. The transformation of the competent DH5α cells was done by heat-shock following the High Efficiency Transformation Protocol of NEB. For this protocol, LB medium was used instead of SOC medium. The cells were plated on LB 1.5% agar supplemented with 50µg·mL<sup>-1</sup> spectinomycin and incubated at 37°C for 1 day.</p>

<title>Effects of nutrient composition on SC in IR1 WT and <italic>Δmoe</italic>A</title>
<p>The visual phenotype of the mutant in comparison to the WT was first checked on agar plates under different nutrient conditions. ASWB agar contains ASW medium with 1% agar and 0.25g·L<sup>-1</sup> nigrosine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Johansen et al., 2018</xref>). ASWB low nutrient medium (ASWBLow) contains the same nutrients as ASWB but without peptone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Johansen et al., 2018</xref>). Minimal medium (MM) contains 0.5% sea salt, 0.1% MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 0.25% kappa-carrageenan (Special Ingredients) and 1% agar. ASWB kappa-carrageenan (ASWBKC) contains the same nutrients as ASWB, but with kappa-carrageenan instead of agar (ASWBC modified from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Johansen et al., 2018</xref>). ASWB fucoidan (ASWBF) contains the same nutrients as ASWB plus 1% fucoidan (Absonutrix) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Johansen et al., 2018</xref>). ASWB starch (ASWBS) contains the same nutrients as ASWB plus 1% starch (Sigma-Aldrich) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Johansen et al., 2018</xref>). Before studying the effects of the nutrient composition, both strains were cultivated overnight at 25°C on an ASWB plate from which some bacterial biomass was collected, resuspended in 1% sea salt and 10µL of the bacteria suspension was spotted on the plates. The mutant was observed after 2 days by eye to check the display of SC.</p>

<title>Determining colony spread</title>
<p>Colonies of IR1 WT and Δ<italic>moeA</italic> were grown as a spot on ASWB, ASWBKC, ASWBF, ASWBS, ASWBLow, and MM for 6 days at 25°C. The diameter of the colonies was measured at two time points, just after the spot was inoculated and after 6 days. These data were measured in triplicates for each condition and strain.</p>

<title>Angle-resolved spectroscopy (goniometry)</title>
<p>The optical properties of the bacteria colonies were studied following the method previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Johansen et al., 2018</xref>).</p>
<p>Angle-dependent reflectance spectra were measured using a custom-built goniometer setup (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Vignolini et al., 2013</xref>) both in scattering and specular configuration. The samples were illuminated from a fixed direction by a Xenon lamp (Ocean Optics HPX-2000), and the reflected light was collected at different detection angles (resolution 1°) using a rotating arm connected to a spectrometer (Avantes HS2048) via an optical fiber. Data presented in this work were normalized against a white diffuser (Labsphere SRS-99-010).</p>

In scattering configuration, diffraction spots are visible that can be correlated to the diffraction grating formed by the bacteria on the surface (Schertel 2020, Johansen 2018). More specifically, the angles of constructive interference from a diffraction grating can be expressed by the grating equation,
<disp-formula id="eqn1">
<graphic xlink:href="632688v2_eqn1.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula>
where m ∈ [0, − 1, + 1, − 2, + 2, …] is the diffraction order, λ is the wavelength of light, d is the period of the structure, θ<italic><sub>i</sub></italic> is the angle of incidence and θ<sub>m</sub> is the reflection angle for a given order. This equation can be used to determine the period (d) of the bacteria organization, and deviation from the predicted diffraction spots can quantitatively inform about the degree of disorder compared to an ideal periodic structure. Information on the effective refractive index can be obtained from goniometry data acquired in specular configuration. In this case, reflectance peaks arise from the constructive interference of light with the multilayer structure and depend on various parameters. Considering both Bragg’s law and Snell’s law, the peak reflection wavelength λ<sub>B</sub> and corresponding incident angles θ<sub>in</sub> at which constructive interference occur are linked via the following equation:
<disp-formula id="eqn2">
<graphic xlink:href="632688v2_eqn2.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula>
where θ<sub>in</sub> is the illumination angle and n<sub>avg</sub> is the volume average effective refractive index of the total material composite in the photonic crystal. For construction, the angle of observation θ<sub>out</sub> equals θ<sub>in</sub>.</p>

<title>Intracellular and extracellular proteome sample preparation</title>
<p>WT IR1 and the <italic>moe</italic>A mutant were selected for intracellular and extracellular proteomics analysis. Cells were grown for 2 days at 25°C completely covering ASWBKC plates. To prepare the whole cell fractions, cultures were harvested and centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 15 min at 4°C in 2mL tubes. Cells were washed with 1% KCl solution, centrifuged at 12,000rpm for 15min at 4°C and cell pellets were stored at -80°C. For preparation of extracellular protein fractions, supernatants were collected after the first cell centrifugation, the supernatants were transferred into new 2 mL tubes, and centrifuged at 12,000rpm for 25 min at 4°C. To ensure reproducibility, both preparations were performed in biological triplicates.</p>
<p>Peptides originating from IR1 intracellular and extracellular proteins were extracted according to the protocol described by Campos and coworkers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Campos et al., 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">2016</xref>). The resulting dried peptides were resuspended in 0.1% formic acid in deionized water followed by bath-sonication for 5 min and 5 min centrifugation at 12,000rpm at 25°C. Peptide concentration was assessed at A280 using ND-1000 Nanodrop spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific) peptide concentrations were adjusted to 0.1mg/ml to normalize samples prior to LC-MS/MS analyses.</p>

<title>Bioinformatic analysis of the molybdopterin operon</title>
<p>We reanalyzed a recent bioinformatic analysis on SC to specifically investigate genes involved in molybdopterin cofactor (MoCo) synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Zomer et al., 2024</xref>). MoCo genes are typically clustered in SC bacteria and are consecutively encoded on the IR1 genome (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>), probably forming an operon comprising molybdopterin molybdenum transferase (<italic>moe</italic>A), molybdenum cofactor guanylyl transferase (<italic>mob</italic>A), uroporphyrinogen-III C- methyltransferase (<italic>sum</italic>T), molybdopterin synthase sulfur carrier unit (<italic>moa</italic>D), adenylyl transferase/sulfur transferase (<italic>moe</italic>Z), molybdopterin synthetase catalytic unit (<italic>moa</italic>E), cyclic pyranopterin monophosphate synthase 2 (<italic>moa</italic>C2), and GTP 3’,8-cyclase (<italic>moa</italic>A). In 117 bacterial genomes (87 SC and 30 non-SC) analyzed (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), most bacteria showing SC contained all these genes, except <italic>mob</italic>A and <italic>moa</italic>D. Meanwhile, in non-SC bacteria, these genes appeared less frequently. Overall, 61 of 87 SC genomes had a complete MoCo pathway, 10 lacked one gene, and 16 lacked two. Conversely, only 6 of 30 non-SC genomes had a full pathway, while others showed partial gene loss, with 6 missing the entire pathway.</p>

<p>The genetic structure of this putative operon for molybdopterin synthesis was compared across 8 strains with variable SC (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1BC</xref>). Using the SC classifier, these strains were scored for SC based on the presence/absence of specific genes in their genomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Zomer et al., 2024</xref>), revealing that the predictions were consistent with our experimental results SC (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>).</p>
<p>Synteny analysis of selected genomes revealed the organization of MoCo synthesis genes. IR1 contains a putative MoCo synthesis operon consisting of <italic>moe</italic>A, <italic>mob</italic>A, <italic>sum</italic>T, <italic>moa</italic>D, <italic>moe</italic>Z, <italic>moa</italic>E, <italic>moa</italic>C2, and <italic>moa</italic>A, and an additional <italic>sum</italic>T homolog. UW101 has a similar operon without the <italic>sumT</italic> duplication (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). Other strains show different gene orders, loci, or variations like missing or duplicated genes. Notably, <italic>Flavobacteriaceae</italic> strains DSM15718 and DD5b, which only contain <italic>sumT</italic>, and HM20, lacking <italic>sumT</italic> but retaining most MoCo genes, do not exhibit SC.

<title>Phenotyping the Δ<italic>moe</italic>A mutant</title>
<p>To study the role of <italic>moe</italic>A in SC, we generated a clean knock-out (KO) of <italic>moe</italic>A in IR1 using the SIBR-Cas tool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Patinios et al., 2021</xref>). After successfully deleting <italic>moe</italic>A, we compared the colors of the Δ<italic>moe</italic>A colonies with those of the wild-type (WT) strain under three nutrient conditions: (1) ASWB, a standard peptone/yeast extract medium; (2) ASWBLow, a low- nutrient medium with yeast extract as the sole nutrient; and (3) minimal medium (MM), with the minimum nutrients required for IR1 growth.</p>
<p>On ASWB agar plates, the WT strain colony showed a vivid brilliant green SC with a red ring, while the Δ<italic>moe</italic>A colony displayed a dull green-blue SC with a blue ring. On ASWBLow, the WT’s SC shifted to a shiny green-yellow-orange color, whereas Δ<italic>moe</italic>A displayed a dull green center with an intense green ring. On MM, both the WT and Δ<italic>moe</italic>A had weaker SC than when grown on higher nutrient media, showed dispersed clusters of cells, and maintained their green and blue hues, respectively. Additionally, Δ<italic>moe</italic>A colonies spread more slowly than the WT under all conditions evaluated. In summary, deleting <italic>moe</italic>A produced a general SC shift from green to blue, and a reduction of colony spreading (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>).</p>

To investigate how nutrient supply affects SC in IR1 WT and Δ<italic>moe</italic>A strains, they were grown as spot on ASW medium gelled with kappa-carrageenan instead of agar (ASWBKC), fucoidan and agar (ASWBF), or starch and agar (ASWBS). On ASWBKC plates, both strains exhibited more intense SC than on ASWB, with Δ<italic>moe</italic>A displaying a brilliant, blue shifted color compared to the WT’s structural green.

On ASWBS, the colonies displayed a mix of colors rather than the mostly monochromatic patterns seen on agar (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>), kappa-carrageenan or fucoidan (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). The WT showed a dull green center, a green-yellow ring, and a shiny red outer ring.

<title>Deletion of the <italic>moe</italic>A gene reduces colony expansion</title>
<p>During the analysis of the colors displayed by IR1 WT and Δ<italic>moe</italic>A, differences in the colony spreading were observed indicating variations in gliding motility. To quantify this, both strains were grown for an extended period, and colony expansion was measured (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>). The Δ<italic>moe</italic>A showed slower colony expansion, reaching about half the size of the WT in most conditions, except on ASWBF, where colony expansion was similar to the WT. Interestingly, Δ<italic>moe</italic>A colony expansion was faster on ASWBLow, and especially on MM, compared to other conditions, which also happened for the WT. Thus, the lack of nutrients is an enhancer of colony expansion.</p>
<p>The organization and motility of groups of cells at the colony edges were visualized using a digital stereo microscope with full coaxial light. Both strains were grown as a spot on ASWB, and the colony edges were visualized for 1 hour (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>). IR1 WT showed high motility of the bacterial layers at the edge of the colony, with dispersed cell layers forming ’vortex’ patterns (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>, yellow arrows). In contrast, Δ<italic>moe</italic>A exhibited limited motility, with a more tightly packed cell organization and a fine, slow-moving layer at the edge (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>, blue arrows).

<title>Quantification of the optical responses of IR1 WT and Δ<italic>moe</italic>A colonies</title>
<p>IR1 WT and Δ<italic>moe</italic>A grown on ASWBKC plates were studied using an optical goniometer to understand the optical characteristics of their displayed colors. We selected this media due to the uniform, vibrant blue coloration of the Δ<italic>moe</italic>A colony.</p>
<p>The complex optical response of both IR1 strains observed in the heatmaps in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref> can be attributed to a polycrystalline two-dimensional structure with hexagonal packing, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Schertel et al., 2020</xref>). In particular, the specular reflection data (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6AB</xref>) allowed us to extrapolate an effective refractive index of 1.38 for both strains, consistent with earlier studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Schertel et al., 2020</xref>). In a diffraction configuration, intense diffraction peaks are observed in the visible range around a detection angle of -30° for wavelengths of 550 nm (green) for IR1 WT colonies (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>) and 480 nm (blue) for Δ<italic>moe</italic>A (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D</xref>), coherent with the primary colors observed qualitatively in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>.</p>
<p>In addition, other two bright diffraction spots are present in both cases outside of the visible range. For IR1 WT, such spots are present around 550 nm, 400 nm, and 350 nm; in Δ<italic>moe</italic>A, these diffraction spots shift to a lower wavelength around 480 nm, 350 nm, and 300 nm. By matching the diffraction grating equation with the observed spots (white dashed lines in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>), the inter-bacterial distance can be obtained (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Schertel et al., 2020</xref>). The periodicity was therefore estimated to be 410 nm for IR1 WT, and 365 nm for Δ<italic>moe</italic>A. This optical analysis aligns with visual observations, confirming the blue shift in Δ<italic>moe</italic>A, and suggested that this change in SC is caused by cells which are still highly ordered but narrower.</p>

<p>Downregulated intracellular proteins were involved in amino acid metabolism (10), RNA processing (10), transport (9), DNA transcription (8), translation (6), fatty acid metabolism (4), antimicrobial resistance (4), nucleotide metabolism (4), cofactor biosynthesis (4), proteolysis (4), biofilm formation (3), homeostasis (3), carbohydrate metabolism (3), lipid metabolism (3), phospholipid transformation (2), stress response (2), transport (2), and various metabolic processes (<xref rid="tbls4" ref-type="table">Table S4</xref>). Additionally, 28 proteins with unknown functions were identified (<xref rid="tbls4" ref-type="table">Table S4</xref>). Some downregulated proteins, such as an ABC transporter ATP- binding protein and a membrane assembly protein (involved in phospholipid transformation), as well as an alanine dehydrogenase (amino acid metabolism), and some hypothetical proteins with unknown role, were completely repressed (found only in the WT).</p>
<p>Upregulated intracellular proteins were involved in transport (12), non-ribosomal peptide synthesis (11), stress response (6), carbohydrate metabolism (5), proteolysis (4), signaling (4), electron transport (3), glycosylation (3), DNA repair (3), amino acid metabolism (2), antibiotic resistance (2), cofactor biosynthesis (2), metabolism (2), RNA processing (2), and various metabolic processes (<xref rid="tbls5" ref-type="table">Table S5</xref>). Additionally, 20 proteins with unknown roles were identified (<xref rid="tbls5" ref-type="table">Table S5</xref>). Notably, among the most upregulated proteins, we observed a 23S rRNA (adenine(1618)-N(6))-methyltransferase (involved in RNA processing), a hypothetical protein (unknown role), a chalcone isomerase (stress response), an aminopeptidase (proteolysis), and a transcriptional regulator (regulation of DNA transcription).</p>
<p>Of the total known proteins in IR1, 27.5% (1,504 proteins) extracellular proteins were identified, 60.4% (909) were statistically significant (p&lt;0.01), with 20.5% (186) considered downregulated, and 20% (182) upregulated in Δ<italic>moeA</italic> (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7B</xref>). The downregulated subset included 44 hypothetical proteins, while the upregulated subset had 70. Although fewer proteins were identified in the extracellular space compared to the intracellular space, a higher proportion were statistically significant and differentially regulated.</p>
<p>Analysis of downregulated proteins using SecretomeP showed that 29.6% (55) were likely secreted through a non-classical way, lacking typical secretion sequence motifs in their N- terminus. Additionally, SignalP analysis revealed that 31.7% (59) had a putative signal peptide, suggesting they are Sec (general secretory pathway) substrates and likely to be secreted. The downregulated proteins likely to be secreted (69) included those involved in carbohydrate metabolism (7), transport (7), stress response (4), antibiotic resistance (3), lipopolysaccharide assembly (3), protein modification (3), electron transport (2), lipid metabolism (2), purine metabolism (2), motility (2), and several other functions (<xref rid="tbls6" ref-type="table">Table S6</xref>). Additionally, 27 proteins with unknown roles were identified (<xref rid="tbls6" ref-type="table">Table S6</xref>). Notably, among the most highly downregulation proteins included a flagellin biosynthesis protein (involved in motility), probably misannotated as the pathways for flagella synthesis are absent in <italic>Flavobacterium</italic> IR1, a murein hydrolase activator (cell division), a hypothetical protein (lipopolysaccharide assembly), a peptidylprolyl isomerase (protein modification), and an azurin (electron transport).</p>
<p>Analysis of upregulated proteins using SecretomeP revealed that 47.3% (86) potentially follow a non-classical secretion pathway. SignalP analysis indicated that 54,4% (99) of the upregulated proteins possessed a signal peptide. The upregulated proteins likely to be secreted (109) included those involved in transport (19), carbohydrate metabolism (18), proteolysis (12), stress response (5), fatty acid metabolism (4), cell division (1), electron transport (1), iron acquisition (1), motility (1), protein modification (1), and signaling (1) (<xref rid="tbls7" ref-type="table">Table S7</xref>). Additionally, 45 proteins with unknown roles were identified (<xref rid="tbls7" ref-type="table">Table S7</xref>). Notably, the most upregulated proteins included two hypothetical proteins (involved in unknown roles), a hypothetical protein (cell division), an acetyl-CoA carboxylase biotin carboxyl carrier protein (fatty acid biosynthesis), a glycoside hydrolase (carbohydrate metabolism), and a hypothetical protein (transport).</p>
<p>The combination of protein analysis and genomic data from the IR1 genome provided insights into the putative operons or gene clusters affected by the deletion of <italic>moe</italic>A (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref>). Intracellular proteomic analysis suggested the downregulation of putative operons associated with antimicrobial drug resistance, fatty acid biosynthesis, purine catabolism, and phospholipid transformation. Conversely, putative operons involved in respiratory electron transport, carbohydrate metabolism, non-ribosomal peptide synthesis, antioxidant stress, and cell wall synthesis were upregulated. In the extracellular proteomic analysis, a putative operon with an unknown function was downregulated, while putative operons involved in fatty acid biosynthesis, carbohydrate metabolism, and unknown functions were upregulated. Notably, the deletion of <italic>moe</italic>A created a cascade of regulation effects that affected pathways not previously linked to molybdopterin synthesis.</p>
<p>Previous studies, alongside the results of this investigation, have shown the importance of complex polysaccharides degradation in the development of SC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Johansen et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">van de Kerkhof et al., 2022</xref>). In the Bacteroidetes phylum, polysaccharides utilization loci (PUL) operons facilitate the uptake and processing of these polysaccharides. Typically, PUL operons consist of a tandem pair of genes resembling <italic>sus</italic>CD, which encode a transport and substrate-binding complex, and various carbohydrate active enzymes (CAZymes), such as glycosyl hydrolases and pectate lyases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Terrapon et al., 2015</xref>).</p>
<p>Our intracellular and extracellular protein analysis revealed the upregulation of three putative PUL operons with similar organization (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref>): (1) PAM95095-90, which includes a glycoamilase, a glycosyl hydrolase family 3 (GH3) involved in cellulose degradation, a glycerophosphoryl diester phosphodiesterase, and a GH43 that degrades hemicellulose and pectin polymers (Ara et at., 2020; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Mewis et al., 2016</xref>); (2) PAM95448-51, which includes an unidentified GH, and a GH35 enzyme that hydrolyzes terminal non-reducing β-D-galactose residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Tanthanuch et al., 2008</xref>); (3) PAM95391-88, which includes a hypothetical protein, and two GH16, one of which was not detected, involved in the degradation of various polysaccharides such as agar and kappa-carrageenan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Viborg et al., 2019</xref>). Additionally, other carbohydrate metabolism-related proteins were upregulated in the Δ<italic>moe</italic>A, including a GH18 enzyme involved in chitin degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Chen et al., 2020</xref>), and a pectate lyase involved in starch degradation (Table S8) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Aspeborg et al., 2012</xref>).</p>

<p>As previously described, the IR1 WT and Δ<italic>moe</italic>A strain were grown on various complex polysaccharides, showing different color phenotypes. The Δ<italic>moe</italic>A colony displayed a strong blue SC phenotype on ASWBKC, a dull green on ASWBF, and a dull blue center with a blue internal ring and green external ring on ASWBS (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>). These results suggest a connection between SC, moeA, and polysaccharide metabolism. Proteins linked to carbohydrate metabolism were also highly regulated, reinforcing this link (Tables S6 and S8). Both strains were grown on ASWS, and starch degradation was visualized using iodine vapor (Kasana and Salwan, 2008). The colonies were photographed from the front and the back (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>SC in biological systems is well-studied optically, but less well understood genetically. This study aimed to expand and deepen the knowledge of genes involved in bacterial SC, focusing on the predicted SC-related gene, <italic>moe</italic>A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Zomer et al., 2024</xref>). By deleting <italic>moe</italic>A from the IR1 genome, a model for bacterial SC, we conducted microbiological, optical, proteomic, and comparative genomic analyses of the mutant. The results demonstrated the possibility of engineering SC by targeting specific pathways.</p>
<p>The <italic>moe</italic>A gene is part of the molybdenum cofactor (MoCo) synthesis pathway, which is not exclusive to bacteria, but also found in archaea, animals, and plants, tracing back to the last universal common ancestor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Allen et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Weiss et al., 2016</xref>). MoCo is essential for molybdoenzymes that catalyze oxo-transfer and hydroxylation reactions such as nitrate reductase, xanthine dehydrogenase, and aldehyde oxidase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Wootton et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Zhang and Gladyshev, 2008</xref>). In the Δ<italic>moe</italic>A proteome, some molybdoenzymes like xanthine hydrogenases, aldehyde oxidase, and nitrite reductase were downregulated, suggesting their synthesis depends on MoCo availability. However, one nitrite reductase protein (PAM94801) was upregulated, potentially independent of MoCo. Additionally, proteins from <italic>moaA</italic>, <italic>moaC2</italic>, and <italic>mob</italic>A genes which are present in the same operon as <italic>moe</italic>A, were upregulated, possibly to boost molybdopterin availability for MoCo synthesis.</p>
<p>The presence of <italic>moe</italic>A in the genome or the putative operon structure for MoCo pathway alone does not determine a bacterial strain’s ability to form SC colonies. For example, the genomes of the Bacteroidetes strains <italic>Flavobacterium</italic> IR1, <italic>F. johnsoniae</italic> UW101, and <italic>C. lytica</italic> HI1, which contain all the genes for the synthesis of MoCo, display SC. Meanwhile, <italic>M. algicola</italic> HM30 and <italic>Z. galactinovorans</italic> DSM1208, lacking <italic>moa</italic>D and <italic>moa</italic>C, respectively, also show SC. Interestingly, the corresponding proteins of <italic>moa</italic>D and <italic>sum</italic>T were not detected in the proteomic analysis of IR1 WT and Δ<italic>moe</italic>A. Additionally, <italic>moa</italic>D and <italic>mob</italic>A were not present in all SC strains. Thus, we concluded that the presence of <italic>moa</italic>C, <italic>moa</italic>D, <italic>mob</italic>A and <italic>sum</italic>T are not essential for SC formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Zomer et al., 2024</xref>).</p>
<p>The predominantly green SC of IR1 WT has been studied using transposon mutagenesis, cultivation, and optical characterization, revealing additional structural colors like yellow, orange, red, blue, and purple (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Johansen et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">van de Kerkhof et al., 2022</xref>). Here, <italic>moe</italic>A was deleted from the IR1 genome using SIBR-Cas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Patinios et al., 2021</xref>), resulting in a strong blue shift in the colony color, confirmed and quantified by goniometry. The WT and Δ<italic>moe</italic>A colonies show variations in color, color pattern and intensity depending on three conditions: 1) observation angle, displaying green, yellow and blue hues with different intensities; 2) the presence of peptone and yeast extract, affecting color and motility; and 3) the type of polysaccharides present in the media, which significantly altered color and motility. These findings showed that SC color hue, pattern, and intensity can be modified by genetic engineering, observation angle, and nutrient changes.</p>
<p>Previously, mutations in <italic>trm</italic>D tRNA methyltransferase, and a <italic>clb</italic>B triosephosphate isomerase were described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Johansen et al., 2018</xref>). A transposon insertion in <italic>trm</italic>D led to the loss of SC, while preserving growth and motility, and a <italic>clb</italic>B disruption produced a dull green/blue SC. Here, TrmD was downregulated, and ClbB upregulated in the Δ<italic>moe</italic>A proteomics analysis. Deleting <italic>moe</italic>A also caused downregulation of GldL, a protein essential for gliding motility and secretion in <italic>F. johnsoniae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Shrivastava et al., 2013</xref>). The reduced motility in the Δ<italic>moe</italic>A mutant may have resulted from the combined downregulation of <italic>trmD</italic>, GldL, ribosomal proteins, and other uncharacterized proteins. Additionally, the upregulation of ClbB and other regulated proteins may contribute to the SC shift from green to blue.</p>
<p>Polysaccharide metabolism in IR1 has been linked to changes in colony color and motility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">van de Kerkhof et al., 2022</xref>). Although <italic>moe</italic>A has not been previously linked to polysaccharide degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Hasona et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Tao et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Leimkühler, 2017</xref>), its deletion led to the upregulation of proteins from three PUL operons and others involved in polysaccharide metabolism, likely causing the color shift from green (WT) to blue (Δ<italic>moe</italic>A). The identified proteins were involved in degrading cellulose, hemicellulose, pectin, galactose polymers, agar, kappa-carrageenan, mannanose, and starch. The polysaccharide degradation versatility was supported by checking the starch degradation in both strains, with the Δ<italic>moe</italic>A capable of degrading starch faster and more efficiently than WT, producing larger and clearer halos with iodine staining.</p>
<p>On different polysaccharide media, the Δ<italic>moe</italic>A strain showed varied SC and colony expansion patterns: green/blue SC and low colony expansion on agar, intense blue SC and low colony expansion on kappa-carrageenan, dull green SC and low colony expansion on fucoidan, and blue/green SC with higher colony expansion on starch. While reduced motility has been associated with dull or absent SC, and reduced polysaccharide metabolism (Kientz et al., 2012a; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Johansen et al., 2018</xref>), Δ<italic>moe</italic>A showed reduced motility, but an intense blue SC, and high polysaccharide metabolism. Based on these results, we established a link among polysaccharide metabolism, MoCo biosynthesis, and SC, showing that intense SC is not strictly dependent on motility.</p>
<p>Ecologically, we hypothesize that dense, highly structured bacterial colonies, such as necessary for the SC phenotype, could limit the loss, by diffusion, of the metabolic degradation products of complex polysaccharides. These large macromolecules are often partially hydrolyzed extracellularly because they are too large to pass through bacterial cell membranes. Bacteria secrete enzymes into the surrounding environment to break these polysaccharides down into more easily absorbable monosaccharides or oligosaccharides. The colony structure could create a physical barrier that keeps these products concentrated and near the cells, allowing the colony to efficiently access and utilize these products, and preventing them from leaking into the surrounding environment. While SC may also yield other ecological benefits associated with growth in biofilms, the highly structured colonies that characterize SC may be more resistant against invasion by competitor species scavenging for degradation products, than an unstructured biofilm. This model is consistent with the observation that SC is associated with polysaccharide metabolism genes, and with the recent observation that SC is mainly localized on surface and interface environments such as air-water interfaces, tidal flats, and marine particles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Zomer et al., 2024</xref>).</p>
<p>SC bacteria like <italic>Cellulophaga lytica</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Sullivan et al., 2023</xref>) and <italic>Flavobacterium</italic> IR1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Groutars and Risseeuw, 2022</xref>) have been recently studied to be used as colorful biomaterials, making genetic engineering to modify SC a potential next step for developing new colorants. Similar to IR1, <italic>C. lytica</italic> belongs to the <italic>Flavobacteriaceae</italic> family, exhibiting gliding motility, similar SC, and has diverse polysaccharide metabolism genes, though it lacks genetic engineering tools (Kientz et al., 2012a; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Kientz et al., 2016</xref>; Lysov et al., 2022). Genetic engineering SC in IR1 opens the way to synthetic biology of SC and its application in biomaterials, offering a sustainable alternative to traditional pigments.</p>
<sec id="s5">
<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Our results demonstrate the involvement of bioinformatically predicted genes in bacterial SC and suggested that such genes could be targeted to modify the optical characteristics of SC colonies. The simple deletion of one gene, <italic>moe</italic>A, shifted the SC of IR1 colony from green to blue, while nutrient and polysaccharide availability emerged as key factors affecting SC color and motility. Proteomics analysis revealed polysaccharide metabolism as a driver of SC hue changes, hinting at its ecological significance. Additionally, several uncharacterized proteins were differentially expressed, providing exciting new leads for further exploration of bacterial SC. This study marks a step forward in the synthetic biology of SC, with promising applications in biomaterials.</p>

<p>This manuscript presents <bold>important</bold> findings on how structural color can be manipulated through a specific single-gene mutation in the motile bacterium Flavobacterium IR1. It provides a promising model to identify genes and molecular mechanisms supporting this widespread optical phenomenon. The story relies on <bold>convincing</bold> data with proteomic analysis and well-designed experiments, although it remains rather descriptive. This work will be of interest to biophysicists and microbiologists working on structural colors and Flavobacterium.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Structural colors (SC) are based on nanostructures reflecting and scattering light and producing optical wave interference. All kinds of living organisms exhibit SC. However, understanding the molecular mechanisms and genes involved may be complicated due to the complexity of these organisms. Hence, bacteria that exhibit SC in colonies, such as Flavobacterium IR1, can be good models.</p>
<p>Based on previous genomic mining and co-occurrence with SC in flavobacterial strains, this article focuses on the role of a specific gene, moeA, in SC of Flavobacterium IR1 strain colonies on an agar plate. moeA is involved in the synthesis of the molybdenum cofactor, which is necessary for the activity of key metabolic enzymes in diverse pathways.</p>
<p>The authors clearly showed that the absence of moeA shifts SC properties in a way that depends on the nutritional conditions. They further bring evidence that this effect was related to several properties of the colony, all impacted by the moeA mutant: cell-cell organization, cell motility and colony spreading, and metabolism of complex carbohydrates. Hence, by linking SC to a single gene in appearance, this work points to cellular organization (as a result of cell-cell arrangement and motility) and metabolism of polysaccharides as key factors for SC in a gliding bacterium. This may prove useful for designing molecular strategies to control SC in bacterial-based biomaterials.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The topic is very interesting from a fundamental viewpoint and has great potential in the field of biomaterials.</p>
<p>The article is easy to read. It builds on previous studies with already established tools to characterize SC at the level of the flavobacterial colony. Experiments are well described and well executed. In addition, the SIBR-Cas method for chromosome engineering in Flavobacteria is the most recent and is a leap forward for future studies in this model, even beyond SC.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The paper appears a bit too descriptive and could be better organized. Some of the results, in particular the proteomic comparison, are not well exploited (not explored experimentally). In my opinion, the problem originates from the difficulty in explaining the link between the absence of moeA and the alterations observed at the level of colony spreading and polysaccharide utilization, and the variation in proteomic content.</p>
<p>First, the effect of moeA deletion on molybdenum cofactor synthesis should be addressed.</p>
<p>Second, as I was reading the entire manuscript, I kept asking myself if moeA (and by extension molybdenum cofactor) was really involved in SC or it was an indirect effect. For example, what if the absence of moeA alters the cell envelope because the synthesis of its building blocks is perturbed, then subsequently perturbates all related processes, including gliding motility and protein secretion? It would help to know if the effects on colony spreading and polysaccharide metabolism can be uncoupled. I don't think the authors discussed that clearly.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors constructed an in-frame deletion of moeA gene, which is involved in molybdopterin cofactor (MoCo) biosynthesis, and investigated its role in structural colors in Flavobacterium IR1. The deletion of moeA shifted colony color from green to blue, reduced colony spreading, and increased starch degradation, which was attributed to the upregulation of various proteins in polysaccharide utilization loci. This study lays the ground for developing new colorants by modifying genes involved in structural colors.</p>
<p>Major strengths and weaknesses:</p>
<p>The authors conducted well-designed experiments with appropriate controls and the results in the paper are presented in a logical manner, which supports their conclusions. Using statistical tests to compare the differences between the wild type and moeA mutant, and adding a significance bar in Figure 4B, would strengthen their claims on differences in cell motility regarding differences in cell motility. Additionally, in the result section (Figure 6), the authors suggest that the shift in blue color is &quot;caused by cells which are still highly ordered but narrower&quot;, which to my knowledge is not backed up by any experimental evidence.</p>
<p>Overall, this is a well-written paper in which the authors effectively address their research questions through proper experimentation. This work will help us understand the genetic basis of structural colors in Flavobacterium and open new avenues to study the roles of additional genes and proteins in structural colors.</p>

<p>We will look at the organisation of the manuscript carefully in the coming, detailed revision, as suggested. In terms of the proteomics, there are clearly a large number of proteins affected by the <italic>moe</italic>A deletion. In terms of experimental exploration, we chose spreading, structural colour formation and starch degradation to test phenotypically, as the most relevant. For example, in L615-617, we discuss the downregulation of GldL (which is known to be involved Flavobacterial gliding motility [Shrivastava et al., 2013]) in the _moe_A KO as a possible explanation for the reduced colony spreading of <italic>moe</italic>A mutant. Changes in polysaccharide (starch) utilization were seen on solid medium, as well as in the proteomic profile where we observed the upregulation of carbohydrate metabolism proteins linked to PUL (polysaccharide utilisation locus) operons (Terrapon et al., 2015), such as PAM95095-90 (Figure 8), and other carbohydrate metabolism-related proteins, including a pectate lyase (Table S7) which is involved in starch degradation (Aspeborg et al., 2012). And as noted in L555-566 and Figure 9, starch metabolism was tested experimentally.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>First, the effect of moeA deletion on molybdenum cofactor synthesis should be addressed.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>MoeA is the last enzyme in the MoCo synthesis pathway, thus if only MoeA is absent the cell would accumulate MPT-AMP (molybdopterin-adenosine monophosphatase) (Iobbi-Nivol &amp; Leimkühler, 2013), and the expressed molybdoenzymes would not be functional. In L582-585, we commented how the lack of molybdenum cofactor may affect the synthesis of molybdoenzymes. However, if you meant to analyse the presence of the small molecules, the cofactors, involved in these pathways, that was an assay we were not able to perform. Moreover, in L585-587, we addressed how the deletion of _moe_A affected the proteins encoded by the rest of genes in the operon.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Second, as I was reading the entire manuscript, I kept asking myself if moeA (and by extension molybdenum cofactor) was really involved in SC or it was an indirect effect.

It would help to know if the effects on colony spreading and polysaccharide metabolism can be uncoupled. I don't think the authors discussed that clearly.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The message of the paper is that the moeA gene, as predicted from a previous genomics analysis, is important in SC. This is based on the representation of the _moe_A gene in genomes of bacteria that display SC. This analysis does not predict the mechanism. When knocked out, a significant change in structural colour occurred, supporting this hypothesis. Whether this effect is direct or indirect is difficult to assess, as this referee rightly suggests. In order to follow up this central result, we performed proteomics (both intra- and extracellular). As we observed, the deletion of a single gene generated many changes in the proteomic profile, thus in the biological processes. Based on the known functions of molybdenum cofactor, we could only hypothesize that pterin metabolism is important for SC, not exactly how.</p>
<p>We intend to discuss the links between gliding/spreading and polysaccharide metabolism more clearly, with reference to the literature, as quite a bit is known here including possible links to SC.</p>

<p>Using statistical tests to compare the differences between the wild type and moeA mutant, and adding a significance bar in Figure 4B, would strengthen their claims on differences in cell motility regarding differences in cell motility.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you. Figure 4B contains the significance bars that represent the standard deviation of the mean value of the three replicates, but we will modify it to make them more clear.</p>
<p>Additionally, in the result section (Figure 6), the authors suggest that the shift in blue color is &quot;caused by cells which are still highly ordered but narrower&quot;, which to my knowledge is not backed up by any experimental evidence.</p>
<p>Thanks. We mentioned that the mutant cells are narrower than the wild type based on the estimated periodicity resulting from the goniometry analysis (L427-430). We will now say “likely to be narrower based on the estimated periodicity from the optical analysis” rather than just “narrower” in the revision.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Overall, this is a well-written paper in which the authors effectively address their research questions through proper experimentation.
