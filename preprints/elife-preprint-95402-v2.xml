<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Mapping neurotransmitter identities to neurons is key to understanding information flow in a nervous system. It also provides valuable entry points for studying the development and plasticity of neuronal identity features. In the <italic>C. elegans</italic> nervous system, neurotransmitter identities have been largely assigned by expression pattern analysis of neurotransmitter pathway genes that encode neurotransmitter biosynthetic enzymes or transporters. However, many of these assignments have relied on multicopy reporter transgenes that may lack relevant <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory information and therefore may not provide an accurate picture of neurotransmitter usage. We analyzed the expression patterns of 16 CRISPR/Cas9-engineered knock-in reporter strains for all main types of neurotransmitters in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (glutamate, acetylcholine, GABA, serotonin, dopamine, tyramine, and octopamine) in both the hermaphrodite and the male. Our analysis reveals novel sites of expression of these neurotransmitter systems within both neurons and glia, as well as non-neural cells. The resulting expression atlas defines neurons that may be exclusively neuropeptidergic, substantially expands the repertoire of neurons capable of co-transmitting multiple neurotransmitters, and identifies novel neurons that uptake monoaminergic neurotransmitters. Furthermore, we also observed unusual co-expression patterns of monoaminergic synthesis pathway genes, suggesting the existence of novel monoaminergic transmitters. Our analysis results in what constitutes the most extensive whole-animal-wide map of neurotransmitter usage to date, paving the way for a better understanding of neuronal communication and neuronal identity specification in <italic>C. elegans</italic>.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Understanding information processing in the brain necessitates the generation of precise maps of neurotransmitter deployment. Moreover, comprehending synaptic wiring diagrams is contingent upon decoding the nature of signaling events between anatomically connected neurons. Mapping of neurotransmitter identities onto individual neuron classes also presents a valuable entry point for studying how neuronal identity features become genetically specified during development and potentially modified in response to specific external factors (such as the environment) or internal factors (such as sexual identity or neuronal activity patterns).</p>
<p>The existence of complete synaptic wiring diagrams of the compact nervous system of male and hermaphrodite <italic>C. elegans</italic> nematodes raises questions about the molecular mechanisms by which individual neurons communicate with each other. <italic>C. elegans</italic> employs the main neurotransmitter systems that are used throughout the animal kingdom, including acetylcholine, glutamate, Î³-aminobutyric acid (GABA), and several monoamines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">S<sc>ulston</sc> <italic>et al</italic>. 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">H<sc>orvitz</sc> <italic>et al</italic>. 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">L<sc>oer and</sc> K<sc>enyon</sc> 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">M<sc>cintire</sc> <italic>et al</italic>. 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">D<sc>uerr</sc> <italic>et al</italic>. 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">L<sc>ee</sc> <italic>et al</italic>. 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">D<sc>uerr</sc> <italic>et al</italic>. 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">A<sc>lkema</sc> <italic>et al</italic>. 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">D<sc>uerr</sc> <italic>et al</italic>. 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">S<sc>errano</sc>-S<sc>aiz</sc> <italic>et al</italic>. 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">P<sc>ereira</sc> <italic>et al</italic>. 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">G<sc>endrel</sc> <italic>et al</italic>. 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">S<sc>errano</sc>-S<sc>aiz</sc> <italic>et al</italic>. 2017b</xref>)(<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>).

<p>While these early approaches proved successful in revealing neurotransmitter identities, they displayed several technical limitations. Since neurotransmitter-synthesizing or - transporting proteins primarily localize to neurites, the cellular identity of expressing cells (usually determined by assessing cell body position) often could not be unambiguously established in several, particularly cell- and neurite-dense regions of the nervous system. One example concerns cholinergic neurons, which are defined by the expression of the vesicular acetylcholine transporter UNC-17/VAChT and choline acetyltransferase CHA-1/ChAT. While mainly neurite-localized UNC-17 and CHA-1 antibody staining experiments could identify a subset of cholinergic neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">D<sc>uerr</sc> <italic>et al</italic>. 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">D<sc>uerr</sc> <italic>et al</italic>. 2008</xref>), many remained unidentified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">P<sc>ereira</sc> <italic>et al</italic>. 2015</xref>). In addition, for GABA-producing neurons, it became apparent that antibody-based GABA detection was dependent on staining protocols, leading to the identification of ânovelâ anti-GABA-positive neurons, i.e. GABAergic neurons, more than 20 years after the initial description of GABAergic neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">M<sc>cintire</sc> <italic>et al</italic>. 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">G<sc>endrel</sc> <italic>et al</italic>. 2016</xref>).</p>
<p>An alternative approach to mapping neurotransmitter usage has been the use of reporter transgenes. This approach has the significant advantage of allowing the fluorophore to either fill the entire cytoplasm of a cell or to be targeted to the nucleus, thereby facilitating neuron identification. However, one shortcoming of transgene-based reporter approaches is that one cannot be certain that a chosen genomic region, fused to a reporter gene, indeed contains all <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements of the respective locus. In fact, the first report that described the expression of the vesicular glutamate transporter EAT-4, the key marker for glutamatergic neuron identity, largely underestimated the number of <italic>eat-4/VLGUT-</italic>positive and, hence, glutamatergic neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">L<sc>ee</sc> <italic>et al</italic>. 1999</xref>). The introduction of fosmid-based reporter transgenes has largely addressed such concerns, as these reporters, with their 30-50 Kb size, usually cover entire intergenic regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">SAROV <italic>et al</italic>. 2012</xref>). Indeed, such fosmid-based reporters have been instrumental in describing the entire <italic>C. elegans</italic> glutamatergic nervous system, defined by the expression of <italic>eat-4/VGLUT</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">S<sc>errano</sc>-S<sc>aiz</sc> <italic>et al</italic>. 2013</xref>), as well as supposedly the complete set of cholinergic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">P<sc>ereira</sc> <italic>et al</italic>. 2015</xref>) and GABAergic neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">G<sc>endrel</sc> <italic>et al</italic>. 2016</xref>).</p>
<p>However, even fosmid-based reporters may not be the final word. In theory, they may still miss distal <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements. Moreover, the multicopy nature of transgenes harbors the risk of overexpression artifacts, such as the titrating of rate-limiting negative regulatory mechanisms. Also, RNAi-based silencing mechanisms triggered by the multicopy nature of transgenic reporter arrays have the potential to dampen the expression of reporter arrays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">NANCE AND FROKJAER-JENSEN 2019</xref>). One way to get around these limitations, while still preserving the advantages of reporter gene approaches, is to generate reporter alleles in which an endogenous locus is tagged with a reporter cassette, using CRISPR/Cas9 genome engineering. Side-by-side comparisons of fosmid-based reporter expression patterns with those of knock-in reporter alleles indeed revealed several instances of discrepancies in expression patterns of homeobox genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">R<sc>eilly</sc> <italic>et al</italic>. 2022</xref>).</p>
<p>An indication that previous neurotransmitter assignments may not have been complete was provided by recent single-cell RNA (scRNA) transcriptomic analyses of the hermaphrodite nervous system by the CeNGEN consortium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">T<sc>aylor</sc> <italic>et al</italic>. 2021</xref>). As we describe in this paper in more detail, transcripts for several neurotransmitter-synthesizing enzymes or transporters were detected in a few cells beyond those previously described to express the respective genes. This motivated us to use CRISPR/Cas9 engineering to fluorescently tag a comprehensive panel of genetic loci that code for neurotransmitter-synthesizing, -transporting, and -uptaking proteins (âneurotransmitter pathway genesâ). Using the landmark strain NeuroPAL for neuron identification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">Y<sc>emini</sc> <italic>et al</italic>. 2021</xref>), we identified novel sites of expression of most neurotransmitter pathway genes. Furthermore, we used these reagents to expand and refine neurotransmitter maps of the entire nervous system of the <italic>C. elegans</italic> male, which contains almost 30% more neurons than the nervous system of the hermaphrodite yet lacks a reported scRNA transcriptome atlas. Together with the NeuroPAL cell-identification tool, these reporter alleles allowed us to substantially improve the previously described neurotransmitter map of the male nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">S<sc>errano</sc>-S<sc>aiz</sc> <italic>et al</italic>. 2017b</xref>). Our analysis provides insights into the breadth of usage of each individual neurotransmitter system, reveals instances of co-transmitter use, indicates the existence of neurons that may entirely rely on neuropeptides instead of classic neurotransmitters, reveals sexual dimorphisms in neurotransmitter usage, and suggests the likely existence of presently unknown neurotransmitters.</p>

<p>Knock-in reporter alleles were generated either by SunyBiotech (<italic>syb</italic> alleles) or in-house (<italic>ot</italic> alleles) using CRISPR/Cas9 genome engineering. Most genes were tagged with a nuclear-targeted <italic>gfp</italic> sequence (<italic>gfp</italic> fused to <italic>his-44</italic>, a histone <italic>h2b</italic> gene) at the 3â end of the locus to capture all isoforms, except <italic>tdc-1</italic> which was tagged at the 5â end.

<p>Since we did not detect fluorophore signals in the <italic>hdl-1(syb1048[hdl-1::gfp])</italic> strain, we attempted to amplify low level signals, by inserting Cre recombinase at the C-terminus of the <italic>hdl-1</italic> locus (<italic>hdl-1(syb4208[hdl-1::t2a::3xnls::cre])</italic>). We crossed this strain to the recently published âFlexonâ strain (<italic>arTi361[rps-27p::gfp&quot;flexon&quot;-h2b::unc-54-3âUTR]</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">SHAFFER AND GREENWALD 2022</xref>). Even low expression of <italic>hdl-1</italic> should have led to Cre-mediated excision of the flexon stop cassette, which is designed to abrogate gene expression by a translational stop and frameshift mutation, and subsequently can result in strong and sustained <italic>gfp</italic> expression under the control of the <italic>rps-27</italic> promoter and thereby providing information about cell-specific <italic>hdl-1</italic> expression. However, no robust, consistent reporter expression was seen in <italic>hdl-1(syb4208[hdl-1::t2a::3xnls::cre]); arTi361[rps-27p::gfp&quot;flexon&quot;-h2b::unc-54-3âUTR]</italic> animals.</p>

<p>For adult animal imaging, 15-25 (exact number depending on the difficulty of neuron ID) same-sex L4 worms were grouped on NGM plates 6-9 hours prior to imaging to control for accurate staging and avoid mating. Young adult worms were then anesthetized using 50â100 mM sodium azide and mounted on 5% agarose pads on glass slides. Z-stack images were acquired with ZEN software using Zeiss confocal microscopes LSM880 and LSM980 or a Zeiss Axio Imager Z2 and processed with ZEN software or FIJI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">S<sc>chindelin</sc> <italic>et al</italic>. 2012</xref>) to create orthogonal projections.

Its expression or function in the nervous system had not previously been analyzed in <italic>C. elegans</italic>.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>For all these 15 genetic loci, we compared scRNA transcriptome data from the CeNGEN scRNA atlas (at all 4 available stringency levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">T<sc>aylor</sc> <italic>et al</italic>. 2021</xref>)) to previously published reporter and antibody staining data. As shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref> and <bold>Table S1</bold>, such comparisons reveal the following: (1) scRNA data support the expression of genes in the vast majority of neurons in which those genes were found to be expressed with previous reporter gene approaches. In most cases, this is true even at the highest threshold levels for scRNA detection. (2) Vice versa, reporter gene expression supports scRNA transcriptome data for a specific neurotransmitter system in the great majority of cells. (3) In spite of this congruence, there were several discrepancies between reporter data and scRNA data. Generally, while valuable, scRNA transcriptome data cannot be considered the final word for any gene expression pattern assignments. Lack of detection of transcripts could be a sensitivity issue and, conversely, the presence of transcripts does not necessarily indicate that the respective protein is generated, due to the possibility of posttranscriptional regulation.</p>
<p>Hence, to consolidate and further improve neurotransmitter identity assignment throughout the entire <italic>C. elegans</italic> nervous system, and to circumvent potential limitations of multicopy, fosmid-based reporter transgenes on which previous neurotransmitter assignments have been based, we engineered and examined expression patterns of 16 knock-in reporter alleles of neurotransmitter synthesis, vesicular transport, and uptake loci listed above (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). For <italic>unc-17</italic> and <italic>eat-4,</italic> we knocked-in a <italic>t2a::gfp::h2b</italic> (<italic>his-44</italic>) cassette right before the stop codon of the respective gene. For <italic>unc-25</italic>, we created two knock-in alleles with the <italic>t2a::gfp::h2b</italic> (<italic>his-44</italic>) cassette tagging isoforms a.1/c.1 and b.1 separately. For <italic>tdc-1,</italic> a <italic>gfp::h2b::t2a</italic> cassette was knocked into the N-terminus of the locus because of different C-terminal splice variants. The self-cleaving T2A peptide frees up GFP::H2B, which will be transported to the nucleus, thereby facilitating cell identification. For <italic>unc-46</italic>, <italic>unc-47</italic>, <italic>tph-1</italic>, <italic>bas-1</italic>, <italic>tbc-1</italic>, <italic>cat-1</italic>, <italic>cat-2</italic>, <italic>snf-3</italic>, and <italic>oct-1</italic>, we knocked-in a <italic>sl2::gfp::h2b</italic> cassette at the C-terminus of the locus. Both types of reporter cassettes should capture posttranscriptional, 3âUTR-mediated regulation of each locus, e.g. by miRNAs and RNA-binding proteins (not captured by CeNGEN scRNA data). Since the reporter is targeted to the nucleus, this strategy circumvents shortcomings associated with interpreting antibody staining patterns or dealing with too densely packed cytosolic signals. For <italic>mod-5</italic>, we analyzed an existing reporter allele (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">M<sc>aicas</sc> <italic>et al</italic>. 2021</xref>). For all our neuronal cell identification, we utilized the neuronal landmark strain NeuroPAL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">T<sc>ekieli</sc> <italic>et al</italic>. 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">Y<sc>emini</sc> <italic>et al</italic>. 2021</xref>).</p>

<p>Another neuron found to have some <italic>eat-4</italic> transcripts, but only with the two lower threshold sets, is the I6 pharyngeal neuron. Consistent with our previous fosmid-based reporter data, we detected no I6 expression with our <italic>eat-4(syb4257)</italic> reporter allele. The <italic>eat-4</italic> reporter allele also shows expression in the pharyngeal neuron M5, albeit very weakly (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>, <bold>Table S2</bold>), consistent with CeNGEN scRNA data.

Extremely dim expression in PHA can be occasionally detected.

An absence of <italic>eat-4(syb4257)</italic> expression in AVL and DVB is also consistent with the absence of scRNA transcripts in these neurons.</p>
<p>A few neurons were found to express <italic>eat-4</italic> transcripts by the CeNGEN atlas, but only with lower threshold levels, including, for example, the RMD, PVM, and I4 neurons (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref><bold>, Table S1</bold>).

<p>We detected a novel site of <italic>unc-17</italic> expression, albeit dim, in the glutamatergic AFD neurons (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>, <bold>Table S2</bold>). This expression was not reported with previous fosmid-based reporter or CeNGEN scRNA data. scRNA transcript reads for <italic>cha-1/ChAT</italic>, the ACh-synthesizing choline acetyltransferase, were also detected in AFD and PVN (<bold>Table S1</bold>). Taken together, these observations are consistent with the expectation that although available scRNA data capture the majority of gene expression, it may not necessarily have the required depth to detect lowly expressed genes.</p>
<p>Lastly, another notable observation is the lack of any <italic>unc-17</italic> reporter expression or CeNGEN scRNA transcripts in the interneuron AVJ, but presence of CeNGEN scRNA transcript reads for <italic>cha-1/ChAT</italic> (<bold>Table S1</bold>), which shares exons with the <italic>unc-17/VAChT</italic> locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">A<sc>lfonso</sc> <italic>et al</italic>. 1994</xref>). Although no reporter data is available for <italic>cha-1/ChAT</italic>, such interesting mismatch between available <italic>unc-17</italic> and <italic>cha-1/ChAT</italic> expression data could provide a hint to potential non-vesicular cholinergic transmission in the AVJ neurons in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, potentially akin to reportedly non-vesicular release of acetylcholine in the visual system of <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">YANG AND KUNES 2004</xref>).</p>

<p>The most recent analysis of GABAergic neurons identified GABA-synthesizing cells by anti-GABA staining and an SL2-based <italic>unc-25/GAD</italic> reporter allele that monitors expression of the rate-limiting step of GABA synthesis, generated by CRISPR/Cas9 engineering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">G<sc>endrel</sc> <italic>et al</italic>. 2016</xref>). The CeNGEN scRNA atlas shows robust support for these assignments at all 4 threshold levels (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>, <bold>Table S1</bold>). <italic>unc-25</italic> scRNA signals were detected at several orders of magnitude lower levels in 3 additional neuron classes, but only with the least robust threshold level.</p>
<p>In this study we generated another <italic>unc-25/GAD</italic> reporter allele, using a <italic>t2a::gfp::h2b</italic> cassette (<italic>ot1372</italic>) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>).

This includes a lack of expression in a number of neurons that stain with anti-GABA antibodies (SMD, AVA, AVB, AVJ, ALA, and AVF) and GLR glia, corroborating the notion that these neurons take up GABA from other cells (indeed, a subset of those cells do express the GABA uptake reporter SNF-11; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">G<sc>endrel</sc> <italic>et al</italic>. 2016</xref>)).</p>

Furthermore, since these reporters do not capture an alternatively spiced isoform b.1, we generated another reporter allele, <italic>unc-25(ot1536)</italic>, to specifically target this isoform.

<title>Expression of <italic>unc-47/VGAT</italic></title>
<p>While promoter-based transgenes for the vesicular transporter for GABA, <italic>unc-47/VGAT</italic>, had shown expression that precisely match that of <italic>unc-25/GAD</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">E<sc>astman</sc> <italic>et al</italic>. 1999</xref>), we had noted in our previous analysis of the GABA system that a fosmid-based reporter showed much broader expression in many additional neuron classes that showed no sign of GABA usage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">G<sc>endrel</sc> <italic>et al</italic>. 2016</xref>). In several of these neuron classes both the fosmid-based reporter and the CeNGEN scRNA data indicate very robust expression (e.g. AIN, SIA, SDQ), while in many others scRNA transcripts are only evident at looser thresholds and, correspondingly, fosmid-based reporter expression in these cells is often weak (<bold>Table S1</bold>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">G<sc>endrel</sc> <italic>et al</italic>. 2016</xref>). To investigate this matter further, we CRISPR/Cas9-engineered a <italic>gfp-</italic>based reporter allele for <italic>unc-47</italic>, <italic>syb7566</italic>, and first crossed it with an mCherry-based <italic>unc-47</italic> fosmid-based reporter (<italic>otIs564</italic>) as a first-pass assessment for any obvious overlaps and mismatch of expression patterns between the two (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>, left side panels). The vast majority of neurons exhibited overlapping expression between <italic>syb7566</italic> and <italic>otIs564</italic>. There were also many notable similarities in the robustness of expression of the fosmid-based reporter and the reporter allele (<bold>Table S1</bold>). In a few cases where the fosmid-based reporter expression was so dim that it is only detectable via antibody staining against its fluorophore (mCherry) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">G<sc>endrel</sc> <italic>et al</italic>. 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">S<sc>errano</sc>-S<sc>aiz</sc> <italic>et al</italic>. 2017b</xref>), the reporter allele expression was readily visible (<bold>Table S1</bold>).</p>
<p>The very few mismatches of expression of the fosmid-based reporter and the reporter allele included the pharyngeal neuron M1, which expresses no visible <italic>unc-47(syb7566)</italic> reporter allele but weak fosmid-based reporter expression, and the pharyngeal neuron I1, which expresses dim <italic>syb7566</italic> but no fosmid-based reporter (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>, right side panels). Similarly, AVJ shows very dim and variable <italic>unc-47(syb7566)</italic> reporter allele expression but no fosmid-based reporter expression. Since AVJ stains with anti-GABA antibodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">G<sc>endrel</sc> <italic>et al</italic>. 2016</xref>), this neuron classifies as an uptake and recycling neuron. Other neurons previously shown to stain with anti-GABA antibodies and to express the <italic>unc-47</italic> fosmid-based reporter (ALA and SMD)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">G<sc>endrel</sc> <italic>et al</italic>. 2016</xref>) still show expression of the <italic>unc-47</italic> reporter allele. In contrast, the anti-GABA-positive AVA and AVB neurons express no <italic>unc-47</italic> and therefore possibly operate solely in GABA clearance (see Discussion).</p>
<p>In conclusion, while the reporter allele of <italic>unc-47/VGAT,</italic> in conjunction with CeNGEN scRNA data, corroborates the notion that <italic>unc-47/VGAT</italic> is expressed in all GABA-synthesizing and most GABA uptake neurons, there is a substantial number of <italic>unc-47-</italic>positive neurons that do not show any evidence of GABA presence. This suggests that UNC-47/VGAT may transport another unidentified neurotransmitter (see Discussion)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">G<sc>endrel</sc> <italic>et al</italic>. 2016</xref>).</p>

A previously analyzed fosmid-based reporter confirmed <italic>unc-46/LAMP</italic> expression in all âclassicâ GABAergic neurons (i.e. anti-GABA and <italic>unc-25/GAD-</italic>positive neurons), but also showed robust expression in GABA- and <italic>unc-47</italic>-negative neurons, such as RMD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">G<sc>endrel</sc> <italic>et al</italic>. 2016</xref>).

We generated an <italic>unc-46/LAMP</italic> reporter allele, <italic>syb7278</italic>, and found its expression to be largely similar to that of the fosmid-based reporter and to the scRNA data (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref><bold>, Table S1</bold>), therefore corroborating the non-GABAergic neuron expression of <italic>unc-46/LAMP.</italic> We also detected previously unreported expression in the PVW and PVN neurons in both the reporter allele and fosmid-based reporter (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>), thereby further corroborating CeNGEN data. In addition, we also detected very dim expression in PDA (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>), which shows no scRNA transcript reads (<bold>Table S1</bold>). With one exception (pharyngeal M2 neuron class), the sites of non-GABAergic neuron expression of <italic>unc-46/LAMP</italic> expression do not show any overlap with the sites of <italic>unc-47/VGAT</italic> expression, indicating that these two proteins have functions independent of each other.</p>

<title>Expression of a reporter allele of <italic>cat-1/VMAT,</italic> a marker for monoaminergic identity, in the hermaphrodite</title>
<p>As the vesicular monoamine transporter, <italic>cat-1/VMAT</italic> is expected to be expressed in all neurons that synthesize serotonin, dopamine, tyramine, and octopamine (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). Both scRNA data and a CRISPR/Cas9-engineered reporter allele, <italic>syb6486</italic>, confirm expression in all these cells (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C</xref>, <bold>Table S2</bold>). In addition, based on antibody staining and previous fosmid-based reporters, <italic>cat-1/VMAT</italic> is known to be expressed in neurons that are serotonin-positive (VC4, VC5, and RIH) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">D<sc>uerr</sc> <italic>et al</italic>. 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">D<sc>uerr</sc> <italic>et al</italic>. 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">S<sc>errano</sc>-S<sc>aiz</sc> <italic>et al</italic>. 2017b</xref>). Again, both scRNA data, as well as a CRISPR/Cas9-engineered reporter allele, <italic>syb6486</italic>, confirm expression in these cells (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C</xref>, <bold>Table S2</bold>).</p>
<p>In addition to these canonical monoaminergic neurons, the CeNGEN scRNA data shows <italic>cat-1/VMAT</italic> expression at all 4 threshold levels in RIR, CAN, AVM and, at much lower threshold, 8 additional neuron classes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>, <bold>Table S1</bold>). Our <italic>cat-1/VMAT</italic> reporter allele, <italic>syb6486,</italic> corroborates expression in RIR and CAN, but not in AVM (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C</xref>, <bold>Table S2</bold>). We also observed expression of the <italic>cat-1</italic> reporter allele in two of the neuron classes with scRNA transcripts at the lowest threshold level, ASI and variably, AVL (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C</xref><bold>, Table S1</bold>). Interestingly, AVL does not express any other monoaminergic pathway genes (<bold>Table S2</bold>), therefore it may be transporting a new amine yet to be discovered. This scenario also applies for two male-specific neurons (more below). As previously mentioned, we detected no <italic>cat-1/VMAT</italic> expression in the <italic>tph-1-</italic>positive MI or the <italic>cat-2/TH-</italic>positive OLL neurons.</p>
<p>The <italic>cat-1/VMAT</italic> reporter allele revealed expression in an additional neuron class, the AUA neuron pair (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C</xref>, <bold>Table S2</bold>). Expression in this neuron is not detected in scRNA data; such expression may be consistent with previous CAT-1/VMAT antibody staining data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">D<sc>uerr</sc> <italic>et al</italic>. 1999</xref>). These authors found the same expression pattern as we detected with <italic>cat-1/VMAT</italic> reporter allele, except for the AIM neuron, which D<sc>uerr</sc> <italic>et al</italic>. identified as CAT-1/VMAT antibody-staining positive. However, neither our reporter allele, nor a fosmid-based <italic>cat-1/VMAT</italic> reporter, nor scRNA data showed expression in AIM, and we therefore think that the neurons identified by D<sc>uerr</sc> <italic>et al</italic> as AIM may have been the AUA neurons instead (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">S<sc>errano</sc>-S<sc>aiz</sc> <italic>et al</italic>. 2017b</xref>). Additionally, a <italic>cat-1</italic>-positive neuron pair in the ventral ganglion, unidentified but mentioned by Duerr and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">D<sc>uerr</sc> <italic>et al</italic>. 1999</xref>), is likely the tyraminergic RIM neuron pair, based on our reporter allele and CeNGEN scRNA data.</p>

<title>Expression of reporter alleles of monoamine uptake transporters in the hermaphrodite</title>
<p>In addition to or in lieu of synthesizing monoamines, neurons can uptake them from their surroundings. To investigate the cellular sites of monoamine uptake in more detail, we analyzed fluorescent protein expression from engineered reporter alleles for the uptake transporters of 5-HT (<italic>mod-5/SERT(vlc47)</italic>), the predicted uptake transporter for tyramine (<italic>oct-1/OCT(syb8870)</italic>), and that for betaine (<italic>snf-3/BGT1(syb7290)</italic>).</p>

<title>Serotonin/5-HT uptake</title>
<p>Using a promoter-based transgene and antibody staining, previous work had shown expression of the serotonin uptake transporter <italic>mod-5</italic> in NSM, ADF, RIH, and AIM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">J<sc>afari</sc> <italic>et al</italic>. 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">M<sc>aicas</sc> <italic>et al</italic>. 2021</xref>). This matched the observations that RIH and AIM do not synthesize 5-HT (i.e. do not express <italic>tph-1</italic>), but stain positive with a 5-HT antibody (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">J<sc>afari</sc> <italic>et al</italic>. 2011</xref>). In <italic>mod-5</italic> mutants or wildtype worms treated with serotonin reuptake inhibitors (such as the SSRI fluoxetine), RIH and AIM lose 5-HT immunoreactivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">J<sc>afari</sc> <italic>et al</italic>. 2011</xref>). We analyzed a CRISPR-based reporter allele, <italic>mod-5(vlc47)</italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">MAICAS et al. 2021</xref>), and confirmed expression in the four neuron classes NSM, ADF, RIH, and AIM (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>). Because only NSM, ADF, and RIH, but not AIM, express the reporter allele of the monoamine transporter CAT-1/VMAT (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>), we agree with previous studies that AIM likely functions as a serotonin uptake/clearance neuron (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref><bold>, 2</bold>; see also Discussion). In addition, we also detected dim expression in the phasmid neuron class PHA and very dim, variable signal in URX (<xref rid="fig12" ref-type="fig">Fig. 12A,B</xref><bold>,E</bold>), consistent with scRNA data (<bold>Table S1</bold>). The results for anti-5-HT-staining from previous reports are variable in a few neurons, possibly due to differences in staining methods (including URX, I5, VC4, VC5 and PVW (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">LOER AND KENYON 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">RAND AND NONET 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">D<sc>uerr</sc> <italic>et al</italic>. 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">S<sc>errano</sc>-S<sc>aiz</sc> <italic>et al</italic>. 2017b</xref>).

Since VC4 and VC5 do not express the complete synthesis pathway for 5-HT, we infer that the anti-5-HT staining in these neurons is a result of alternative 5-HT uptake or synthesis mechanisms.

<title>Tyramine uptake</title>
<p>Biochemical studies in vertebrates have shown that the SLC22A1/2/3 (aka OCT-1/2/3) organic anion transporter can uptake monoaminergic neurotransmitters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">NIGAM 2018</xref>), with SLC22A2 being apparently selective for tyramine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">B<sc>erry</sc> <italic>et al</italic>. 2016</xref>). <italic>oct-1</italic> is the ortholog of the OCT subclass of SLC22 family members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">Z<sc>hu</sc> <italic>et al</italic>. 2015</xref>), but neither its expression nor function in the nervous system had been previously reported.

<title>Betaine uptake</title>
<p>Notably, four CAT-1/VMAT- expressing neuron classes, CAN, AUA, RIR, and ASI do not express biosynthetic enzymes for synthesis of the four conventional monoaminergic transmitters known to be employed in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (5-HT, dopamine, octopamine, or tyramine). Hence, these neuron classes might instead uptake some of these transmitters. We considered the putative neurotransmitter betaine as a possible candidate, since CAT-1/VMAT is also able to package betaine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">P<sc>eden</sc> <italic>et al</italic>. 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">H<sc>ardege</sc> <italic>et al</italic>. 2022</xref>). Betaine is synthesized endogenously, within the nervous system mostly in the <italic>cat-1/VMAT-</italic> positive RIM neuron (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">H<sc>ardege</sc> <italic>et al</italic>. 2022</xref>), but it is also available in the bacterial diet of <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">P<sc>eden</sc> <italic>et al</italic>. 2013</xref>). In vertebrates, dietary betaine is taken up by the betaine transporter BGT1 (i.e. SLC6A12). To test whether <italic>cat-1/VMAT</italic>-positive neurons may acquire betaine via BGT1-mediated uptake, we CRISPR/Cas9-engineered a reporter allele for <italic>snf- 3/BGT1</italic>, <italic>syb7290</italic>. We detected expression in the betaine-synthesizing (and also tyraminergic) RIM neuron (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9</xref>, <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref><bold>, 2</bold>). In addition, <italic>snf-3</italic> is indeed expressed in all the four <italic>cat-1/VMAT-</italic>positive neuron classes that do not synthesize a previously known monoaminergic transmitter (CAN, AUA, and variably, RIR and ASI)(<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9A,B</xref>). These neurons may therefore take up betaine and synaptically release it via CAT-1/VMAT. The <italic>snf-3(syb7290)</italic> reporter allele is also expressed in the serotonergic neuron NSM (albeit variably) (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref><bold>, 2</bold>), thus NSM could also be a betaine uptake neuron. In addition, we also detected <italic>snf-3(syb7290)</italic> expression in several other neurons that do not express <italic>cat-1(syb6486)</italic> (<bold>Table S1</bold>). Expression was also observed in a substantial number of non-neuronal cell types (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9E-G</xref>, <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref><bold>, S1</bold>). These neurons and non-neuronal cells may serve to clear betaine (see Discussion, Neurotransmitter synthesis versus uptake). <italic>snf-3(syb7290)</italic> is not expressed in the inner and outer labial neuron classes as previously suggested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">P<sc>eden</sc> <italic>et al</italic>. 2013</xref>); these cells were likely misidentified in the previous study and are in fact inner and outer labial glial cells (as discussed further below).</p>

<p>We detected no neurons in addition to the sex-shared RIC neuron class that shares all features of a functional octopaminergic neuron, i.e. co-expression of <italic>tbh-1/TBH, tdc-1/TDC,</italic> and <italic>cat-1/VMAT.</italic> While one male-specific neuron, R8B, shows an overlap of expression of <italic>tdc- 1(syb7768)</italic> and <italic>tbh-1(syb7786)</italic>, indicating that these neurons can synthesize octopamine, R8B does not express <italic>cat-1(syb6486)</italic>, indicating that these neurons cannot engage in vesicular release of octopamine.</p>

The absence of the TDC-1/AAAD protein, which produces tyramine, the canonical substrate of the TBH-1 enzyme (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>), indicates that TBH-1 must be involved in the synthesis of a compound other than octopamine.

Rather than using L-Dopa or 5-HTP as substrate, BAS-1/AAAD may decarboxylate aromatic amino acids, which then may serve as a substrate for TBH-1.

<title>unc-47/VGAT</title>
<p><italic>unc-47(syb7566)</italic> confirms previously reported sexually dimorphic expression of <italic>unc-47/VGAT</italic> in several sex-shared neurons, including ADF, PDB, PVN, PHC, AS10, and AS11 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>, right side panels) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">S<sc>errano</sc>-S<sc>aiz</sc> <italic>et al</italic>. 2017b</xref>). The assignment of AS10 was not definitive in our last report (we had considered either DA7 or AS10), but with the help of NeuroPAL the AS10 assignment could be clarified. In all these cases expression was only detected in males and not hermaphrodites. It is worth mentioning that expression of the mCherry-based <italic>unc-47/VGAT</italic> fosmid-based reporter <italic>(otIs564)</italic> in some of these neurons was so dim that it could only be detected through immunostaining against the mCherry fluorophore and not readily visible with the fosmid-based reporter by itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">S<sc>errano</sc>-S<sc>aiz</sc> <italic>et al</italic>. 2017b</xref>). In contrast, the <italic>unc-47/VGAT</italic> reporter allele is detected in all cases except the PQR neuron class.

<title>mod-5/SERT</title>
<p>Expression of the <italic>mod-5(vlc47)</italic> reporter allele is sexually dimorphic in the pheromone-sensing ADF neurons, with higher levels in hermaphrodites compared to males (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8F</xref>). Notably, the serotonin-synthesizing enzyme (<italic>tph-1</italic>) and vesicular acetylcholine transporter (<italic>unc-17</italic>) do not exhibit this dimorphism in ADF (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8F</xref>). This suggests that the sex difference specifically involves serotonin signaling mechanisms, particularly serotonin uptake rather than synthesis.</p>
<p>We had previously reported that the PVW neuron stains with anti-5-HT antibodies exclusively in males but did not detect expression of a fosmid-based reporter for the serotonin-synthesizing enzyme TPH-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">S<sc>errano</sc>-S<sc>aiz</sc> <italic>et al</italic>. 2017b</xref>). We confirmed the lack of <italic>tph-1</italic> expression with our new <italic>tph-1</italic> reporter allele in both males and hermaphrodites, and also found that hermaphrodite and male PVW does not express the reporter allele for the other enzyme in the 5-HT synthesis pathway, <italic>bas-1.</italic> Because of very dim <italic>cat-1::mCherry</italic> fosmid-based reporter expression that was only detected upon anti-mCherry antibody staining, we had assigned PVW as a 5-HT-releasing neuron (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">S<sc>errano</sc>-S<sc>aiz</sc> <italic>et al</italic>. 2017b</xref>). However, we failed to detect expression of our new <italic>cat-1/VMAT</italic> reporter allele in PVW. Neither did we detect expression of the <italic>mod-5(vlc47)</italic> reporter allele. Taken together, PVW either synthesizes or uptakes 5-HT by unconventional means, akin to the pharyngeal I5 neuron.</p>
<p>In conclusion, although there are some updates in the levels of dimorphic gene expression (PVN and ADF neuron classes), our analysis with reporter alleles does not reveal pervasive novel sexual dimorphism in sex-shared neurons compared to those that we previously identified in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">S<sc>errano</sc>-S<sc>aiz</sc> <italic>et al</italic>. 2017b</xref>).

<p>We detected no expression of other vesicular transporters or neurotransmitter biosynthetic synthesis machinery in glia of either sex. This observation contrasts previous reports on GABA synthesis and release from the AMsh glia cell type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">D<sc>uan</sc> <italic>et al</italic>. 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">F<sc>ernandez</sc>-A<sc>bascal</sc> <italic>et al</italic>. 2022</xref>). We were not able to detect signals in AMsh with anti-GABA staining, nor with an SL2 or T2A-based GFP-based reporter allele for any <italic>unc-25</italic> isoform. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">G<sc>endrel</sc> <italic>et al</italic>. 2016</xref>)(M. Gendrel, pers. comm.; this paper).</p>
<p>There is, however, evidence for neurotransmitter uptake by <italic>C. elegans</italic> glial cells, mirroring this specific function of vertebrate glia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">HENN AND HAMBERGER 1971</xref>). We had previously shown that one specific glia-like cell type in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, the GLR glia, take up GABA via the GABA uptake transporter SNF-11 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">G<sc>endrel</sc> <italic>et al</italic>. 2016</xref>).

Hence, these glia are unlikely to release GABA via classic vesicular machinery. Other release mechanisms for GABA can of course not be excluded. Aside from the <italic>snf-11</italic> expression in GLR glia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">G<sc>endrel</sc> <italic>et al</italic>. 2016</xref>), we detected expression of the putative tyramine uptake transporter <italic>oct-1/OCT</italic> in a number of head glial cells (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8K</xref>), as well as broad glial expression of the betaine uptake transporter <italic>snf-3/BGT1</italic> in the head, midbody, and tail (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9E,F</xref>). These results indicate tyramine and betaine clearance roles for glia.</p>

<title>Neurotransmitter pathway gene expression outside the nervous system</title>
<p>We detected expression of a few neurotransmitter pathway genes in cells outside the nervous system. The most prominent sites of reporter allele expression are located within the somatic gonad. We detected expression of <italic>tdc-1(syb7768)</italic> and <italic>tbh-1(syb7786)</italic> reporter alleles in the gonadal sheath of hermaphrodite as well as <italic>tdc-1(syb7768)</italic> expression in the neuroendocrine uv1 cells (<xref rid="fig14" ref-type="fig">Fig. 14C</xref><bold>; Fig. S3</bold>), as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">A<sc>lkema</sc> <italic>et al</italic>. 2005</xref>). Intriguingly, while <italic>cat-1(syb6486)</italic> is expressed in a midbody gonadal cell posterior to the vulva, likely the distal valve (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C</xref>, <bold>Fig. S3</bold>), we observed no expression of <italic>cat-1(syb6486)</italic> in the gonadal sheath or the uv1 cells (<xref rid="fig14" ref-type="fig">Fig. 14C</xref>). This suggests alternative release mechanisms for tyramine and octopamine. A vertebrate homolog of the putative tyramine uptake transporter, <italic>oct-1,</italic> has been found to be located presynaptically and to co-purify with synaptosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">B<sc>erry</sc> <italic>et al</italic>. 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">M<sc>atsui</sc> <italic>et al</italic>. 2016</xref>), therefore indicating that this transporter may have the potential to also act in tyramine release, at least in vertebrate cells. However, we observed no expression of our <italic>oct-1</italic> reporter allele in uv1 or gonadal sheath cells.</p>
<p>In the male, <italic>tdc-1(syb7768)</italic>, <italic>tbh-1(syb7786)</italic>, <italic>cat-1(syb6486)</italic>, and <italic>oct-1(syb8870)</italic> animals also show reporter expression in the somatic gonad: while all four genes are expressed in the vas deferens, <italic>cat-1</italic> and <italic>tbh-1</italic>, but not <italic>tdc-1</italic> or <italic>oct-1</italic>, are expressed in the seminal vesicle (<xref rid="fig14" ref-type="fig">Fig. 14C</xref>, <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8K</xref>). A similar pattern of <italic>cat-1</italic>(+); <italic>tbh-1</italic>(+); <italic>tdc-1</italic>(-); <italic>oct-1</italic>(-) is detected in several male-specific neurons and may indicate the usage of a novel transmitter (e.g. PEOH, see Discussion) by these cells. <italic>snf-3/BGT1</italic> is also expressed in male somatic gonad cells, indicating that these cells could also use betaine for signaling (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9E</xref>).</p>
<p>The AAADs <italic>tdc-1</italic>, as well as <italic>bas-1</italic>, are also prominently expressed in the intestine, where <italic>bas-1</italic> has been shown to be involved in generating 5-HT-derived glucosides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">Y<sc>u</sc> <italic>et al</italic>. 2023</xref>). <italic>bas-1</italic>, but not <italic>tdc-1</italic>, is also expressed in the hypodermis and seam cells, as is the betaine uptake transporter <italic>snf-3</italic> (<bold>Fig. S1G, S3</bold>). The <italic>tph-1</italic> reporter allele expresses in a subset of pharyngeal non-neuronal cells during the L1 to L4 larval stages of development (<bold>Fig. S2</bold>), which is consistent with low levels of <italic>tph-1</italic> transcripts detected in pharyngeal muscles in the CeNGEN scRNA dataset.

<title>Neurotransmitter synthesis versus uptake</title>
<p>Direct detection of neurotransmitters through antibody staining has shown that at least two neurotransmitters, GABA and 5-HT, are present in some neurons that do not express the synthesis machinery for these transmitters (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref><bold>, 2</bold>). Instead, these neurons acquire GABA and 5-HT through uptaking them via defined uptake transporters, SNF-11/BGT1 for GABA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">M<sc>ullen</sc> <italic>et al</italic>. 2006</xref>) and MOD-5/SERT for 5-HT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">R<sc>anganathan</sc> <italic>et al</italic>. 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">J<sc>afari</sc> <italic>et al</italic>. 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>A combination of CeNGEN scRNA transcriptome and our reporter allele data corroborates the absence of synthesis machinery in these presumptive uptake neurons (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref><bold>, 2</bold>). One interesting question that relates to these uptake neurons is whether they serve as âsinksâ for clearance of a neurotransmitter or whether the taken-up neurotransmitter is subsequently ârecycledâ for synaptic release via a vesicular transporter. Previous data, as well as our updated expression profiles, provide evidence for both scenarios: ALA and AVF do not synthesize GABA via UNC-25/GAD, but they stain with anti-GABA antibodies in a manner that is dependent on the uptake transporter SNF-11 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">G<sc>endrel</sc> <italic>et al</italic>. 2016</xref>). ALA expresses <italic>unc-47</italic>, hence it is likely to synaptically release GABA, but AVF does not, and it is therefore apparently involved only in GABA clearance. Similarly, RIH, AIM, and PGA express the 5-HT uptake transporter <italic>mod-5/SERT</italic> and stain for 5-HT in a MOD-5-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">J<sc>afari</sc> <italic>et al</italic>. 2011</xref>)(this study), but only RIH, not AIM or PGA, expresses the vesicular transporter <italic>cat-1/VMAT</italic>, suggesting RIH is likely a serotonergic signaling neuron whereas AIM and PGA are clearance neurons.</p>
<p>Some neurons do not obviously fall into the synthesis or uptake category, most notably, the anti-GABA-antibody-positive AVA and AVB neurons (both of which conventional cholinergic neurons). None of these neurons express <italic>unc-25/GAD</italic>, nor the <italic>snf-11/BGT1</italic> uptake transporter, yet <italic>unc-25/GAD</italic> is required for their anti-GABA-positive staining (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">G<sc>endrel</sc> <italic>et al</italic>. 2016</xref>). This suggests that GABA may be acquired by these neurons through non-canonical uptake or synthesis mechanisms. Also, the AVA and AVB neurons do not express UNC-47 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">G<sc>endrel</sc> <italic>et al</italic>. 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">T<sc>aylor</sc> <italic>et al</italic>. 2021</xref>)(this study); hence, it is not clear if or how GABA is released from them. A member of the bestrophin family of ion channels has been shown to mediate GABA release from astrocyte glia in vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">L<sc>ee</sc> <italic>et al</italic>. 2010</xref>) and, more recently, in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">CHENG et al. 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">GRAZIANO et al. 2024</xref>). However, while there are more than 20 bestrophin channels encoded in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">HOBERT 2013</xref>), they do not appear to be expressed in the AVA or AVB neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">T<sc>aylor</sc> <italic>et al</italic>. 2021</xref>).</p>
<p>The co-expression of a specific uptake transporter and a vesicular transporter also leads us to predict the usage of betaine as a potential neurotransmitter. Betaine is known to be synthesized in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, but is also taken up via its diet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">P<sc>eden</sc> <italic>et al</italic>. 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">H<sc>ardege</sc> <italic>et al</italic>. 2022</xref>). Betaine has documented effects on animal behavior and acts via activation of several betaine-gated ion channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">P<sc>eden</sc> <italic>et al</italic>. 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">H<sc>ardege</sc> <italic>et al</italic>. 2022</xref>). Expression of biosynthetic enzymes suggests betaine production in at least the RIM neuron class, which also expresses the vesicular transporter <italic>cat-1/VMAT</italic>, capable of transporting betaine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">H<sc>ardege</sc> <italic>et al</italic>. 2022</xref>). The expression of the betaine uptake transporter <italic>snf-3/BGT1</italic> in CAN, AUA, RIR, ASI, and male-specific neuron PDC, coupled with their co-expression of <italic>cat-1/VMAT</italic>, suggests that several distinct neuron classes in different parts of the nervous system may uptake betaine and engage in vesicular betaine release via CAT-1/VMAT to gate betaine-activated ion channels, such as ACR-23 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">P<sc>eden</sc> <italic>et al</italic>. 2013</xref>) or LGC-41 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">H<sc>ardege</sc> <italic>et al</italic>. 2022</xref>). Additionally, we detected the <italic>snf-3/BGT1</italic> reporter allele in several other neuron classes that do not co-express <italic>cat-1/VMAT</italic>. This indicates that these neurons could function as betaine clearance neurons.</p>
<p>Lastly, based on sequence similarity and expression pattern, we predict that the ortholog of the OCT subclass of SLC22 family, <italic>oct-1</italic>, could serve as a tyramine uptake transporter in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. We identified RIM to be the only neuron expressing an <italic>oct-1</italic> reporter allele, suggesting that like several other monoaminergic neuron classes, RIM both synthesizes its monoaminergic transmitter, tyramine, and reuptakes it after release.</p>

<title>Novel monoaminergic transmitters?</title>
<p>Three neuron classes (AVL, PVX, and PVY) express <italic>cat-1/VMAT</italic> but do not express the canonical synthesis machinery for 5-HT, tyramine, octopamine, or dopamine.

PEOH is a purported neurotransmitter in Aplysia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">S<sc>aavedra</sc> <italic>et al</italic>. 1977</xref>) and the vertebrate brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">SAAVEDRA AND AXELROD 1973</xref>) and can indeed be detected in <italic>C. elegans</italic> extracts (F. Schroeder, pers. comm.).</p>
<p><italic>bas-1/AAAD</italic> may also be responsible for the synthesis of histamine, an aminergic neurotransmitter that can be found in extracts of <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">PERTEL AND WILSON 1974</xref>). The only other AAAD that displays reasonable sequence similarity to neurotransmitter-producing AAADs is the <italic>hdl-1</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">HARE AND LOER 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">HOBERT 2013</xref>)(<bold>Fig. S1B</bold>), for which we, however, did not detect any expression in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> nervous system (<bold>Fig. S1D</bold>). Since there are neurons that only express <italic>bas-1/AAAD</italic>, but no enzyme that produces canonical substrates for <italic>bas-1/AAAD</italic> (<italic>tph-1/TPH, cat-2/TH;</italic> <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>) and since at least a subset of these neurons express the monoamine transporter <italic>cat-1/VMAT, bas-1/AAAD</italic> may be involved in synthesizing another currently know bioactive monoamine.</p>
<p>Conversely, based on the expression of <italic>tph-1</italic>, but concurrent absence of <italic>bas-1/AAAD,</italic> the pharyngeal MI neuron, hermaphrodite VC4 and VC5, and male neurons CEM and R9B may produce 5-HTP (<bold>Fig. S1A, </bold><xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). 5-HTP may either be used directly as a signaling molecule or it may be metabolized into some other serotonin derivative, an interesting possibility in light of serotonin-derivatives produced elsewhere in the body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">Y<sc>u</sc> <italic>et al</italic>. 2023</xref>).</p>
<p>Additionally, 3 neuron classes (IL2, HOB, and R5B) express <italic>tbh-1</italic> but lack expression of any other genes in canonical monoaminergic pathways, including <italic>bas-1</italic> (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). This observation further suggests the presence of non-canonical mechanisms for monoaminergic synthesis. Taken together, monoaminergic pathway genes are expressed in unconventional combinations in several neuron classes, pointing towards the existence of yet undiscovered monoaminergic signaling systems.</p>

<title>Neurons devoid of canonical neurotransmitter pathway genes may define neuropeptide-only neurons</title>
<p>We identified neurons that do not express any conventional, well-characterized vesicular neurotransmitter transporter families, namely UNC-17/VAChT, CAT-1/VMAT (the only SLC18 family members), UNC-47/VGAT (only SLC32 family member), or EAT-4/VGLUT (an SLC17 family member). Six sex-shared neurons (AVH, BDU, PVM, PVQ, PVW, RMG) and one male-specific neuron (SPD) fall into this category. Most of these neurons exhibit features that are consistent with them being entirely neuropeptidergic. First, electron microscopy has revealed a relative paucity of clear synaptic vesicles in most of these neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">W<sc>hite</sc> <italic>et al</italic>. 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">C<sc>ook</sc> <italic>et al</italic>. 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">W<sc>itvliet</sc> <italic>et al</italic>. 2021</xref>). Second, not only do these neurons express a multitude of neuropeptide-encoding genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">T<sc>aylor</sc> <italic>et al</italic>. 2021</xref>), but they also display a dense interconnectivity in the âwirelessâ neuropeptidergic connectome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">R<sc>ipoll</sc>-S<sc>anchez</sc> <italic>et al</italic>. 2022</xref>).</p>
<p>That said, electron microscopy shows that some of the neurons devoid of conventional neurotransmitter pathway genes generate synapses with small, clear synaptic vesicles, indicative of the use of non-peptidergic transmitters (e.g. the sex-shared RMG and PVM neurons or the male-specific SPD neurons) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">W<sc>hite</sc> <italic>et al</italic>. 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">C<sc>ook</sc> <italic>et al</italic>. 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">W<sc>itvliet</sc> <italic>et al</italic>. 2021</xref>). It is therefore conceivable that either conventional neurotransmitters utilize non-conventional neurotransmitter synthesis and/or release pathways, or that completely novel neurotransmitter systems remain to be discovered. Although the <italic>C. elegans</italic> genome does not encode additional members of the SLC18A2/3 (<italic>cat-1/VMAT, unc-17/VAChT</italic>) or SLC32A1 (<italic>unc-47/VGAT</italic>) family of vesicular neurotransmitter transporters, it does contain a number of additional members of the SLC17A6/7/8 (VLGUT) family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">HOBERT 2013</xref>). These may serve as non-canonical vesicular transporters of more uncommon neurotransmitters or, alternatively, may be involved in modulating release of glutamate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">S<sc>errano</sc>-S<sc>aiz</sc> <italic>et al</italic>. 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">C<sc>hoi</sc> <italic>et al</italic>. 2021</xref>). Uncharacterized paralogs of <italic>bona fide</italic> neurotransmitter uptake transporters (SLC6 superfamily) may also have functions in neurotransmitter release rather than uptake. However, based on CeNGEN scRNA data, no robust or selective expression of these SLC17 or SLC6 family members is observed in these âorphan neuronsâ.</p>

<title>Co-transmission of multiple neurotransmitters</title>
<p>Our analysis expands the repertoire of neurons that co-transmit multiple neurotransmitters (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). Neurotransmitter co-transmission has been observed in multiple combinations in the vertebrate brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">WALLACE AND SABATINI 2023</xref>). In <italic>C. elegans,</italic> the most frequent co-transmission configurations are a classic, fast transmitter (acetylcholine or glutamate) with a monoamine. Co-transmission of two distinct monoaminergic systems also exists. In several cases, however, it is not clear whether the second neurotransmitter is indeed used for communication or whether its presence is merely a reflection of this neuron being solely an uptake neuron. For example, the glutamatergic AIM neuron stains positive for serotonin, which it uptakes via the uptake transporter MOD-5, but it does not express the vesicular monoamine transporter <italic>cat-1/VMAT</italic> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>, <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>, <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, <bold>2</bold>).</p>
<p>Co-transmission of small, fast-acting neurotransmitters (glutamate, GABA, acetylcholine) does exist, but it is rare (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). The most prominent co-transmission configuration is acetylcholine with glutamate, but acetylcholine can also be co-transmitted with GABA. There are no examples of co-transmission of glutamate and GABA, as observed in several regions of the vertebrate brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">WALLACE AND SABATINI 2023</xref>).</p>
<p>Interestingly, co-transmission appears to be much more prevalent in the male-specific nervous system, compared to the sex-shared nervous system (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>, <bold>Table S3</bold>). Remarkably, several male-specific neuron classes may utilize three co-transmitters. Such extensive co-transmission may relate to male-specific neurons displaying a greater degree of anatomical complexity compared to the hermaphrodite nervous system, both in terms of branching patterns and extent of synaptic connectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">J<sc>arrell</sc> <italic>et al</italic>. 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">C<sc>ook</sc> <italic>et al</italic>. 2019</xref>). Given that all co-transmitting neurons display multiple synaptic outputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">C<sc>ook</sc> <italic>et al</italic>. 2019</xref>), it appears possible that each individual neurotransmitter secretory system is distributed to distinct synapses. Based on vertebrate precedent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">WALLACE AND SABATINI 2023</xref>), co-release from the same vesicle is also possible.</p>

<title>Sexual dimorphisms in neurotransmitter usage</title>
<p>The observation of sexual dimorphisms in neurotransmitter abundance in specific regions of the mammalian brain has been one of the earliest molecular descriptors of neuronal sex differences in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">M<sc>ccarthy</sc> <italic>et al</italic>. 1997</xref>). However, it has remained unclear whether such differences are the result of the presence of sex-specific neurons or are indications of distinctive neurotransmitter usage in sex-shared neurons. Using <italic>C. elegans</italic> as a model, we have been able to precisely investigate (a) whether sex-specific neurons display a bias in neurotransmitter usage and (b) whether there are neurotransmitter dimorphisms in sex-shared neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">P<sc>ereira</sc> <italic>et al</italic>. 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">G<sc>endrel</sc> <italic>et al</italic>. 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">S<sc>errano</sc>-S<sc>aiz</sc> <italic>et al</italic>. 2017b</xref>)(this paper). We found that male-specific neurons display a roughly similar proportional usage of individual neurotransmitter systems and note that male specific neurons display substantially more evidence of co-transmission, a possible reflection of their more elaborate morphology and connectivity. We also confirmed evidence for sexual dimorphisms in neurotransmitter usage in sex-shared neurons (<bold>Table S4</bold>), which are usually correlated with sexual dimorphisms in synaptic connectivity of these sex-shared neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">C<sc>ook</sc> <italic>et al</italic>. 2019</xref>).</p>

<title>Neurotransmitter pathway genes in glia and gonad</title>
<p>Neurotransmitter uptake is a classic function of glial cells across animal phylogeny (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">HENN AND HAMBERGER 1971</xref>), and such uptake mechanisms are observed in <italic>C. elegans</italic> as well. Previous reports demonstrated glutamate uptake by CEPsh (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">K<sc>atz</sc> <italic>et al</italic>. 2019</xref>) and GABA uptake by GLR glia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">G<sc>endrel</sc> <italic>et al</italic>. 2016</xref>). We now add to this list betaine uptake by most glia, as inferred from the expression pattern of SNF-3/BGT1 (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9</xref>, <bold>Table S1</bold>).</p>
<p>Studies in vertebrates have also suggested that specific glial cell types synthesize and release several neurotransmitters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">A<sc>raque</sc> <italic>et al</italic>. 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">SAVTCHOUK AND VOLTERRA 2018</xref>). For example, astrocytes were recently shown to express VGLUT1 to release glutamate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">DE C<sc>eglia</sc> <italic>et al</italic>. 2023</xref>). Evidence of neurotransmitter synthesis and release also exists in <italic>C. elegans.</italic> Previous work indicated that glia associated with male-specific spicule neurons synthesize (through <italic>cat-2/TH</italic> and <italic>bas-1/AAAD</italic>) the monoaminergic transmitter dopamine to control sperm ejaculation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">L<sc>eboeuf</sc> <italic>et al</italic>. 2014</xref>). Our identification of <italic>cat-1/VMAT</italic> expression in these glia indicate that dopamine is released via the canonical vesicular monoamine transporter. We also detected expression of <italic>bas-1/AAAD</italic> in additional male and hermaphrodite glia, indicating the production of other signaling substances released by these glia. <italic>bas-1</italic> has indeed recently been shown to be involved in the synthesis of a class of unconventional serotonin derivates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">Y<sc>u</sc> <italic>et al</italic>. 2023</xref>).</p>
<p>We observed no additional examples of neurotransmitter synthesis and release by glia, based on the apparent absence of detectable expression of neurotransmitter-synthesizing enzymes or any vesicular transporter (<italic>unc-17/VAChT, unc-47/VGAT, eat-4/VGLUT, cat-1/VMAT</italic>). Both observations are particularly notable in the context of previous reports on GABA synthesis and release from the AMsh glia cell type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">D<sc>uan</sc> <italic>et al</italic>. 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">F<sc>ernandez</sc>-A<sc>bascal</sc> <italic>et al</italic>. 2022</xref>). We were not able to detect AMsh with anti-GABA staining, nor with reporter alleles of <italic>unc-25/GAD</italic>. However, since very low levels of <italic>unc-25</italic> are observed in AMsh scRNA datasets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">T<sc>aylor</sc> <italic>et al</italic>. 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">P<sc>urice</sc> <italic>et al</italic>. 2023</xref>), the abundance of GABA in AMsh may lie below conventional detection levels.</p>
<p>Outside the nervous system, the most prominent and functionally best characterized usage of neurotransmitters lies in the hermaphrodite somatic gonad, which has been shown to synthesize octopamine and use it to control oocyte quiescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">A<sc>lkema</sc> <italic>et al</italic>. 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">K<sc>im</sc> <italic>et al</italic>. 2021</xref>). Intriguingly, we also detected <italic>tbh-1, tdc-1,</italic> and <italic>cat-1</italic> expression in the somatic gonad of the male, specifically the vas deferens, which is known to contain secretory granules that are positive for secretory molecular markers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">N<sc>onet</sc> <italic>et al</italic>. 1993</xref>). The presence of octopamine is unexpected because, unlike oocytes, sperm are not presently known to require monoaminergic signals for any aspect of their maturation. It will be interesting to assess sperm differentiation and function of <italic>tbh-1</italic> or <italic>tdc-1</italic> mutant animals. The usage of monoaminergic signaling systems in the gonad is not restricted to <italic>C. elegans</italic> and has been discussed in the context of sperm functionality and oocyte maturation in vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">M<sc>ayerhofer</sc> <italic>et al</italic>. 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">R<sc>amirez</sc>-R<sc>eveco</sc> <italic>et al</italic>. 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">A<sc>lhajeri</sc> <italic>et al</italic>. 2022</xref>).</p>

<title>Comparing approaches and caveats of expression pattern analysis</title>
<p>Our analysis also provides an unprecedented and systematic comparison of antibody staining, CeNGEN scRNA transcript data, reporter transgene expression, and knock-in reporter allele expression. The bottom-line conclusions of these comparisons are: (1) Reporter alleles reveal more sites of expression than fosmid-based reporters. It is unclear whether this is due to the lack of <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements in fosmid-based reporters or issues associated with the multicopy-nature of these reporters (e.g. RNAi-based gene silencing of multicopy arrays or squelching of regulatory factors). Another factor to consider is that neuron identification for most fosmid-based reporters was carried out prior to the introduction of NeuroPAL. Consequently, errors occasionally occurred, as exemplified by the misidentification of neuron IDs for CA7 and CP7 in previous instances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">S<sc>errano</sc>-S<sc>aiz</sc> <italic>et al</italic>. 2017b</xref>). (2) The best possible reporter approaches (i.e. reporter alleles) show very good overlap with scRNA data, thereby validating each approach. However, our comparisons also show that no single approach is perfect. CeNGEN scRNA data can miss transcripts and can also show transcripts in cells in which there is no independent evidence for gene or protein expression. Conversely, antibody staining displays vagaries related to staining protocols and protein localization, which can be overcome with reporter approaches, but the price to pay with reporter alleles is that if they are based on SL2 or T2A strategies, they may fail to detect additional levels of posttranslational regulation, which may result in protein absence even in the presence of transcripts. The existence of such mechanisms may be a possible explanation for cases where the expression of synthesis and/or transport machinery expression does not match up (e.g. <italic>tdc-1</italic>(-); <italic>tbh-1</italic>(+) neurons).</p>
<p>Our detailed analysis of reporter allele expression has uncovered several cases where expression of a neurotransmitter pathway gene in a given neuron class appears very low and variable from animal to animal. Such variability only exists when expression is dim, thus one possible explanation for it is that expression levels merely hover around an arbitrary microscopical detection limit. However, we cannot rule out the other possibility that this may also reflect true on/off variability of gene expression. Taking this notion a step further, we cannot exclude the possibility that expression observed with reporter alleles misses sites of expression. This possibility is raised by our inability to detect <italic>unc-25/GAD</italic> reporter allele expression in AMsh glia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">D<sc>uan</sc> <italic>et al</italic>. 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">F<sc>ernandez</sc>-A<sc>bascal</sc> <italic>et al</italic>. 2022</xref>) or <italic>eat-4</italic> reporter allele expression in AVL and DVB neurons, in which some (but not other) multicopy reporter transgenes revealed expression of the respective genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">L<sc>i</sc> <italic>et al</italic>. 2023</xref>). Functions of these genes in the respective cell types were corroborated by cell-type specific RNAi experiments and/or rescue experiments; whether there is indeed very low expression of these genes in those respective cells or whether drivers used in these studies for knock-down and/or rescue produce very low expression in other functionally relevant cells remains to be resolved.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>In conclusion, we have presented here the most complete neurotransmitter map that currently exists for any animal nervous system. Efforts to map neurotransmitter usage on a system-wide level are well underway in other organisms, most notably, <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">DENG et al. 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">ECKSTEIN et al. 2024</xref>). The <italic>C. elegans</italic> neurotransmitter map presented here comprises a critical step toward deciphering information flow in the nervous system and provides valuable tools for studying the genetic mechanisms underlying cell identity specification. Moreover, this neurotransmitter map opens new opportunities for investigating sex-specific neuronal differentiation processes, particularly in the male-specific nervous system, where a scarcity of molecular markers has limited the analysis of neuronal identity control. Lastly, our analysis strongly suggests that additional neurotransmitter systems remain to be identified.</p>
<p>While the gene expression patterns delineated here enable informed predictions about novel neuronal functions and neurotransmitter identities, further investigations involving genetic perturbations, high-resolution imaging, complementary functional assays, and analyses across developmental stages are needed to shed further light on neurotransmitter usage. Nonetheless, this comprehensive neurotransmitter map provides a robust foundation for deciphering neural information flow, elucidating developmental mechanisms governing neuronal specification, exploring sexual dimorphisms in neuronal differentiation, and potentially uncovering novel neurotransmitter systems awaiting characterization.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Wang and colleagues conducted a study to determine the neurotransmitter identity of all neurons in C. elegans hermaphrodites and males. They used CRISPR technology to introduce fluorescent gene expression reporters into the genomic loci of NT pathway genes. This approach is expected to better reflect in vivo gene expression compared to other methods like promoter- or fosmid-based transgenes, or available scRNA datasets. The study presents several noteworthy findings, including sexual dimorphisms, patterns of NT co-transmission, neuronal classes that likely use NTs without direct synthesis, and potential identification of unconventional NTs (e.g. betaine releasing neurons). The data is well-described and critically discussed, including a comparison with alternative methods. Although many of the observations and proposals have been previously discussed by the Hobert lab, the current study is particularly valuable due to its comprehensiveness. This NT atlas is the most complete and comprehensive of any nervous system that I am aware of, making it an extremely important tool for the community.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Very compelling study presenting the most comprehensive neurotransmitter (NT) map of any model so far, using state-of-the art tools and validations. The work is very important not only as a resource but also for our understanding that (NT) function of neurons is best understood taking into consideration the full set of genes implicated in NT metabolism and transport.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>None, all have been addressed.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Together with the known anatomical connectivity, molecular atlasses paves the way toward functional maps of the nervous system of C. elegans. Along with the analysis of previous scRNA sequencing and reporter strains, new expression patterns are generated for hermaphrodite and males based on CRISPR-knocked-in GFP reporter strains and the use of the color-coded Neuropal strain to accurately identify neurons. Beyond a map of the known neurotransmitters (GABA, Acetylcholine, Glutamate, dopamine, serotonin, tyramine, octopamine), the atlas also identifies neurons likely using betaine and suggests sets of neurons employing new unknown monoaminergic transmission, or using exclusively peptidergic neurotransmission.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The use of CRISPR reporter alleles and of the Neuropal strain to assign neurotransmitter usage to each neuron is much more rigourous than previous analysis and reveal intriguing differences between scRNA seq, fosmid reporter and CRISPR knock-in approaches. The differences between approaches are discussed.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>All have been addressed.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this paper, Wang et al. provides the most comprehensive description and comparison of the expression of the different genes required to synthesize, transport and recycle the most common neurotransmitters (Glutamate, Acetylcholine, GABA, Serotonin, Dopamine, Octopamine and Tyramine) used by hermaphrodite and male C. elegans. This paper will be a seminal reference in the field. Building and contrasting observations from previous studies using fosmid, multicopy reporters and single cell sequencing, they now describe CRISPR/Cas-9-engineered reporter strains that, in combination with the multicolor pan-neuronal labeling of all C. elegans neurons (NeuroPAL), allows rigorous elucidation of neurotransmitter expression patterns. These novel reporters also illuminate previously unappreciated aspects of neurotransmitter biology in C. elegans, including sexual dimorphism of expression patterns, co-transmission and the elucidation of cell-specific pathways that might represent new forms of neurotransmission.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors set to establish neurotransmitter identities in C. elegans males and hermaphrodites via varying techniques, including integration of previous studies, examination of expression patterns and generation of endogenous CRISPR-labeled alleles. Their study is comprehensive, detailed and rigorous, and achieve the aims. It is an excellent reference for the field, particularly those interested in biosynthetic pathways of neurotransmission and their distribution in vivo, in neuronal and non-neuronal cells.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>No weaknesses noted. The authors do a great job linking their characterizations with other studies and techniques, leading credence to their findings. As the authors note, there are sexually dimorphic differences across animals, and varying expression patterns of enzymes. While it is unlikely there will be huge differences in the reported patterns across individual animals, it is possible that these expression patterns could vary developmentally, or based on physiological or environmental conditions.</p>

<p>The following is the authorsâ response to the original reviews.</p>
<p>We would like to thank the reviewers and editor for their helpful comments and suggestions. In response, we have revised the manuscript in two main ways:</p>
<p>(1) To address the comments about rearranging figures and tables, we added a new Figure 3 that summarizes neurotransmitter assignments across all neuron classes. Our rationale for this change is detailed below.</p>
<p>(2) To address the comment on clarifying neurotransmitter synthesis versus uptake, we analyzed two additional reporter alleles that tag the monoamine uptake transporters for 5-HT and potentially tyramine. These results are now presented in a new Figure 8 and corresponding sections in the manuscript. Related tables have been updated to include this expression data. Two more authors have been added due to their contributions to these experiments.</p>
<p>For more detailed changes, please see our responses to the specific reviewer's comments as well as the revised manuscript.</p>

<p><bold>Public Reviews:</bold></p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Wang and colleagues conducted a study to determine the neurotransmitter identity of all neurons in C. elegans hermaphrodites and males. They used CRISPR technology to introduce fluorescent gene expression reporters into the genomic loci of NT pathway genes. This approach is expected to better reflect in vivo gene expression compared to other methods like promoter- or fosmid-based transgenes, or available scRNA datasets. The study presents several noteworthy findings, including sexual dimorphisms, patterns of NT co-transmission, neuronal classes that likely use NTs without direct synthesis, and potential identification of unconventional NTs (e.g. betaine releasing neurons). The data is well-described and critically discussed, including a comparison with alternative methods. Although many of the observations and proposals have been previously discussed by the Hobert lab, the current study is particularly valuable due to its comprehensiveness. This NT atlas is the most complete and comprehensive of any nervous system that I am aware of, making it an extremely useful tool for the community.</p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Together with the known anatomical connectivity of C. elegans, a neurotransmitter atlas paves the way toward a functional connectivity map. This study refines the expression patterns of key genes for neurotransmission by analyzing the expression patterns from CRISPR-knocked-in GFP reporter strains using the color-coded Neuropal strain to identify neurons. Along with data from previous scRNA sequencing and other reporter strains, examining these expression patterns enhances our understanding of neurotransmitter identity for each neuron in hermaphrodites and the male nervous system. Beyond the known neurotransmitters (GABA, Acetylcholine, Glutamate, dopamine, serotonin, tyramine, octopamine), the atlas also identifies neurons likely using betaine and suggests sets of neurons employing new unknown monoaminergic transmission, or using exclusively peptidergic transmission.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The use of CRISPR reporter alleles and of the Neuropal strain to assign neurotransmitter usage to each neuron is much more rigorous than previous analysis and reveals intriguing differences between scRNA seq, fosmid reporter, and CRISPR knock-in approaches. Among other mechanisms, these differences between approaches could be attributed to 3'UTR regulatory mechanisms for scRNA vs. knockin or titration of rate-limited negative regulatory mechanisms for fosmid vs. knockin. It would be interesting to discuss this and highlight the occurrences of these potential phenomena for future studies.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We recognize that readers of this study may be interested in understanding the differences between the three approaches. Therefore, in the Introduction, we addressed the potential risk of overexpression artifacts associated with multicopy transgenes, such as fosmid-based reporters, which can affect rate-limiting negative regulatory mechanisms. Additionally, in the Discussion, we included a section titled 'Comparing approaches and caveats of expression pattern analysis' to further explore these comparative methods and their associated nuances.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>For GABAergic transmission, one shortcoming arises from the lack of improved expression pattern by a knockin reporter strain for the GABA recapture symporter snf-11. In its absence, it is difficult to make a final conclusion on GABA recapture vs GABA clearance for all neurons expressing the vesicular GABA transporter neurons (unc-47+) but not expressing the GAD/UNC-25 gene e.g. SIA or R2A neurons. At minima, a comparison of the scRNA seq predictions versus the snf-11 fosmid reporter strain expression pattern would help to better judge the proposed role of each neuron in GABA clearance or recycling.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The <italic>snf-11</italic> fosmid-based reporter data shows very good overlap with scRNA seq predictions (now included in Supp. Table S1).</p>
<p>But there are two much stronger reasons why we did not seek to further the analysis of expression of the <italic>snf-11</italic> GABA uptaker:</p>
<p>(1) Due to available anti-GABA staining data, we do know which neurons have the potential to take up GABA (via SNF-11).</p>
<p>(2) Focusing on SNF-11 <italic>function</italic> rather than <italic>expression</italic>, we can ask which neurons lose anti-GABA staining in <italic>snf-11</italic> mutants.</p>
<p>Both of these types of analyses have been done in an earlier study from our lab (Gendrel et al., 2016, PMID 27740909), which, among other things, investigated GABA uptake mechanisms via SNF-11. Apart from analyzing the expression of a fosmid-based <italic>snf-11</italic> reporter, we immunostained worms for GABA in both <italic>snf-11</italic> mutant and wild type backgrounds (results summarized in Tables 1 and 2 of Gendrel et al.). Of the neurons that typically stain for GABA (Table 1, Gendrel et al.), two neuron classes (ALA and AVF) lost the staining in <italic>snf-11</italic> mutants, suggesting that these neurons likely uptake GABA via SNF-11. Importantly, one of the neurons the reviewer mentioned, R2A, stains for GABA in both wild type and <italic>snf-11</italic> mutants, indicating that it likely does not uptake GABA via SNF-11. The other neuron mentioned, SIA, does not stain for GABA in wild type (Table 2, Gendrel et al.), hence not a GABA uptake neuron. In cases like SIA and other neurons, where a neuron does not express <italic>unc-25</italic> but does express <italic>unc-47</italic> reporters (either fosmid or CRISPR reporter alleles), we speculate that UNC-47 transport another neurotransmitter.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Considering the complexities of different tagging approaches, like T2A-GFP and SL2-GFP cassettes, in capturing post-translational and 3'UTR regulation is important. The current formulation is simplistic. e.g. after SL2 trans-splicing the GFP RNA lacks the 5' regulatory elements, T2A-GFP self-cleavage has its own issues, and the his-44-GFP reporter protein does certainly have a different post-translational life than vesicular transporters or cytoplasmic enzymes.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Yes, agreed, these points are mentioned in the Introduction and discussed in &quot;Comparing approaches and caveats of expression pattern analysis&quot; in the Discussion.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Do all splicing variants of neurotransmitter-related genes translate into functional proteins? The possibility that some neurons express a non-functional splice variant, leading to his-74-GFP reporter expression without functional neurotransmitter-related protein production is not addressed.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for bringing up this really interesting point, which we had not considered. First and foremost, with the exception of <italic>unc-25</italic> (discussed in the next point), for all other genes that produce multiple splice forms, we made sure to append our tag (at 5â or 3â end) such that the expression of all splice forms is captured. The reviewer raises the interesting point that in an alternative splicing scenario, some of the cells that express the primary transcript may âswitchâ to an inactive form. While we cannot exclude this possibility, we have confirmed by sequence analysis in WormBase that in five of the six cases where there is alternative splicing, the alternatively spliced exon lies outside the conserved, functionally relevant (enzymatic or structural) domain. In one case, <italic>unc-25</italic>, a shorter isoform is produced that does cut into the functionally relevant domain; however, since all <italic>unc-25</italic> reporter allele expression cells are also staining positive for GABA, this may not be an issue.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Also, one tagged splice variant of unc-25 is expected to fail to produce a GFP reporter, can this cause trouble?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Yes, there is indeed a third splice variant of <italic>unc-25</italic> with an alternative C-terminus. To address potential expression of this isoform, we CRISPR-engineered another reporter, <italic>unc-25(ot1536[unc-25b.1::t2a::gfp::h2b])</italic>, in which the inserted <italic>t2a::gfp::h2b</italic> sequences are fused to the C-terminus of the alternative splice form, but we did not observe any expression of this reporter. Now included in the manuscript.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this paper, Wang et al. provide the most comprehensive description and comparison of the expression of the different genes required to synthesize, transport, and recycle the most common neurotransmitters (Glutamate, Acetylcholine, GABA, Serotonin, Dopamine, Octopamine, and Tyramine) used by hermaphrodite and male C. elegans. This paper will be a seminal reference in the field. Building and contrasting observations from previous studies using fosmid, multicopy reporters, and single-cell sequencing, they now describe CRISPR/Cas-9-engineered reporter strains that, in combination with the multicolor pan-neuronal labeling of all C. elegans neurons (NeuroPAL), allows rigorous elucidation of neurotransmitter expression patterns. These novel reporters also illuminate previously unappreciated aspects of neurotransmitter biology in C. elegans, including sexual dimorphism of expression patterns, cotransmission, and the elucidation of cell-specific pathways that might represent new forms of neurotransmission.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors set out to establish neurotransmitter identities in C. elegans males and hermaphrodites via varying techniques, including integration of previous studies, examination of expression patterns, and generation of endogenous CRISPR-labeled alleles. Their study is comprehensive, detailed, and rigorous, and achieves the aims. It is an excellent reference for the field, particularly those interested in biosynthetic pathways of neurotransmission and their distribution in vivo, in neuronal and non-neuronal cells.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>No weaknesses were noted. The authors do a great job linking their characterizations with other studies and techniques, giving credence to their findings. As the authors note, there are sexually dimorphic differences across animals and varying expression patterns of enzymes. While it is unlikely there will be huge differences in the reported patterns across individual animals, it is possible that these expression patterns could vary developmentally, or based on physiological or environmental conditions. It is unclear from the study how many animals were imaged for each condition, and if the authors noted changes across individuals during development (could be further acknowledged in the discussion?)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have updated the Methods section to specify the number of animals used for imaging. We agree with the reviewer that documenting the developmental dynamics of neurotransmitter expression would be interesting. However, except for one gene (<italic>tph-1</italic>, Fig. S2), we did not analyze the expression during different developmental stages for most genes in this study. Following the reviewer's suggestion, we have included this as a potential future direction in &quot;Conclusions&quot; at the end of the revised manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Recommendations for the authors</bold>:</p>
<p>After the consultation session, a common suggestion from the reviewers is to bring the tables more upfront, perhaps even in the form of legible main Figures and in alphabetical order of neurons; since we believe that the study will be in the long-term often used for these data; while the Figures with fluorescent expression patterns could be moved to the supplemental information.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the reviewers' and editor's acknowledgment of the tables' possibly frequent usage by the field. We have considered carefully how to order the data presentation. We prefer to keep most of the fluorescent figures in the main text because they convey important subtleties that we want the reader to be aware of.</p>
<p>To address the suggestions to bring key data more upfront, we have added an entirely new figure (Figure 3) before the ensuing data figures that summarized expression patterns of the fluorescent reporters. This new figure (A) summarizes the neurotransmitter use for all neuron classes and (B) illustrates this information within worm schematics, showing the position of neurons in the whole worm. This figure serves as a good overview of neurotransmitter assignments but also specifically refers to the more extensive data and supplementary tables with detailed notes. We believe this solution effectively balances the need for comprehensive information and ease of reference.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>Suggestions:</p>
<p>(1) The study contains up to 10 Figures with gene expression patterns; however, I believe the community will use this paper mostly in the future for its summarizing tables. I wonder if it would be more useful to edit the tables and move them to the main figures while most fluorescent reporter images could be moved to the supplementary part.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Yes, as mentioned above, we made new summary table &amp; schematic upfront. We do prefer to keep primary data in main figure body. Please see above (Public Review &amp; Response).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) In the section titled 'Neurotransmitter Synthesis versus Uptake', the author's wording could be more careful. The data rather suggests functions for individual neuronal classes, such as clearance neurons or signaling neurons. However, these functions remain hypotheses until further detailed studies are conducted to test them.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>These are fair points. We have made several improvements:</p>
<p>(1) In the referenced section, we added a sentence at the end of the paragraph on betaine to suggest the importance of future functional studies.</p>
<p>(2) We analyzed reporter allele expression for two additional genes: the known uptake transporter for 5-HT (<italic>mod-5</italic>, reporter allele <italic>vlc47</italic>) and the predicted uptake transporter for tyramine (<italic>oct-1</italic>, reporter allele <italic>syb8870</italic>). The results from these experiments are presented in the new Figure 8 and discussed in Results and Discussion correspondingly. We also collaborated with Curtis Loer, who conducted anti-5-HT staining in wild type and <italic>mod-5</italic> mutant animals (results shown in Figure 12). These experiments have enhanced our understanding of 5-HT uptake mechanisms and potential tyramine uptake mechanisms.</p>
<p>(3) At the end of the Conclusions, we emphasized the need for future detailed studies to test the functions of neurotransmitter synthesis and uptake.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) Page 21; add to the discussion: neurons could use mainly electrical synapses for communication. Especially for RMG neurons, this might be the case (in addition to neuropeptide communication).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>âMain usageâ is a difficult term to use. If there were neurons that are clearly devoid of any form of synaptic vesicle (small or DCV; note that RMG has plenty of DCVs), but show robust and reproducible electrical synapses, we would agree that such neurons could primarily be a âcouplingâ neuron. But this call is very hard to make for any <italic>C. elegans</italic> neuron (RMG included) and hence we prefer to not add further to an already quite long Discussion section.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) Page 23: I believe that multi-copy promoter-based transgenes (despite array suppression mechanisms) could be potentially more sensitive than single-copy insertion of fluorescent reporters. In our lab, we observed this a couple of times. This could be discussed.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We discuss this in &quot;Comparing approaches and caveats of expression pattern analysis&quot; in the Discussion.</p>
<p>We have also added a third possibility (i.e. technical issues related to neuron-ID) in the revised manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>Comment during consultation session: As for my feedback on the lack of an SNF-11 reporter strain, exercising more caution in their conclusions would suffice for me. Other comments are simple edits/discussion.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Please see above.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Several neurotransmitter symporters exist in the C. elegans genome, does any express specifically in the &quot;orphan&quot; UNC-47+ neurons?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Yes, good point, we considered this possibility, but of the &gt;10 SLC6-family of neurotransmitter reporters, only the classic, de-orphanized ones that we discuss here in the paper show robust scRNA signals (as discussed in the paper) and none of those give clues about the orphan <italic>unc-47</italic>(+) neurons.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Based on UNC-47+ expression the article suggests a &quot;Novel inhibitory neurotransmitter&quot;. Why would any new neurotransmitter using UNC-47 be necessarily inhibitory? The presence of one potential glycine-gated anion channel and one GPCR in C. elegans genome sounds poor evidence to suggest a sign of glycine or b-alanine transmission.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Yes, agreed, it does not need to be inhibitory. Fixed in Results and Discussion.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>To help readers the expression of the knocked in GFP in neurons should not be reported as binary in table S1 which leads to a feeling of strong discrepancy between scRNA seq and CRISPR GFP, which is not the case.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>There might be some misunderstanding regarding the coloring in this table. To clarify, the green-filled Excel cells denote the expression of reporters utilized in prior studies, rather than the CRISPR reporter alleles. Expression of the CRISPR alleles is instead indicated on the left side of the neuron names, marked as &quot;CRISPR+&quot; in green font. For signifying absence of expression, we used &quot;no CRISPR&quot; in red font in the first submission. We have now changed it into &quot;CRISPR-&quot; for greater clarity.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The variable expression of reporter GFP between individuals for the same neuron is intriguing. It is unclear if this is observed only for dim neurons or can be more of an ON/OFF expression.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Variability only occurs for dim expression. We have now clarified this point in Discussion, &quot;Comparing approaches and caveats of expression pattern analysis&quot;.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The multiple occurrences of co-transmission, especially in male neurons, are interesting. It will be interesting in the future to establish whether the neurotransmitters are synaptically segregated or coreleased. As the section on sexual dimorphism of neurotransmitter usage does not discuss novel information coming from this study, it is not very necessary.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Agreed. We added this perspective to the Discussion, &quot;Co-transmission of multiple neurotransmitters&quot;.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>In the abstract, dopamine is missing in the main known transmitter.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Fixed. Thanks for spotting this.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>Great article. Minor suggestions to strengthen presentation:</p>
<p>Figure 1B is hard to interpret. There could be more intuitive ways of representing the data and the methodologies that support a given expression pattern. Neurons should also be reordered by alphabetical order rather than expression levels to facilitate finding them.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We considered alternative ways of presenting this data, but, regrettably, did not come up with a better approach. To clarify, the primary focus of Fig. 1B is to compare expression of previously reported reporters and scRNA data, which was quite literally the initial impetus for our analysis, i.e. we noted strong scRNA signals that had not previously been supported by transgenic reporter data. For a comprehensive version of the table that includes more details on the expression of CRISPR reporter alleles, please refer to Table S1, which we referenced in the figure legend.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>GFP-only channel images in Figures 3, 4, 5, and 9 sometimes show dim signals that the authors are highlighting as new findings. We recommend using the inverted grayscale version of that channel since the contrast of dim signals is more noticeable to the human eye rather than when the image is colorized.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Good point, we implemented these suggestions in the figures the reviewer mentioned, now re-numbered Figures 4, 5, 6, and 12. For Figure 6 (<italic>tph-1</italic>, <italic>bas-1</italic>, and <italic>cat-1</italic> expression in hermaphrodites), we used a new <italic>cat-1</italic> head image to reflect the newly identified ASI and AVL expression that wasnât readily visible in the original projection used in the earlier version of this manuscript. We also added grayscale images in Figure 13 to reflect dim <italic>tbh-1</italic> expression in IL2 neurons more clearly.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>A plan to integrate this new information into WormAtlas. The C. elegans community is characterized by the open sharing of information on platforms that are user-friendly and accessible. Ideally, the new information would not just 'erase' what was observed before but will describe the new observations and will let the community reach their own conclusions since there is no perfect method and even these CRISPR/Cas9 reporter strains are only proxy for gene expression that subject to post-transcriptional regulation since they depend on T2A and SL2 sequences.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We completely agree with the reviewerâs suggestion. We will coordinate with WormAtlas on integrating this new information.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>In the case of neurons that were removed from using a specific neurotransmitter, like PVQ. What do the authors conclude overall, if it does not use glutamate, are there any new hypotheses to what it could be using?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Since all neurons express multiple neuropeptides, we hypothesize neurons such as PVQ may be primarily peptidergic. This is included in Discussion, &quot;Neurons devoid of canonical neurotransmitter pathway genes may define neuropeptide-only neurons&quot;.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>In Table S5, the I4 neuron is listed as a variable for eat-4 expression but in Table S1 it says that there was no CRISPR expression detected. Which one is correct?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks for spotting this. Table S5 is correct, we saw very dim and variable expression of the <italic>eat-4</italic> reporter allele in I4. Table S1 is fixed now.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Additional discussion points that might be important for the community:</p>
<p>CRIPSR strains used here should be deposited in the CGC.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Yes, all strains generated in this study have already been deposited to CGC.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>It would be great to have an additional discussion point on how the neural clusters in CenGEN were defined based on the fosmid reporter expression, so in a way using the defining factor as one that was already defined by it might make results confusing.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Neural cluster definition in CeNGEN did not rely on isolated data points but on the combination of many expression reagents, each with its own shortcomings, but in combination providing reliable identification. Since one feedback we have gotten from many readers of our manuscript is that it is already very long as is, we prefer not to dilute the discussion further.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>It would be important to discuss the rate of neurotransmitter genes that have variable expression patterns. Are any of those genes used in NeuroPAL to define specific neuronal classes? This is important to describe as NeuroPAL labeling is being used to define neuronal identity.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>All the reporters used in NeuroPAL are promoter-based, very robust and do not include the full loci of genes, so they are not directly comparable with the CRISPR reporter alleles in this study. However, we recognize that some expression pattern variability could be confusing. We have discussed this more in the section &quot;Comparing approaches and caveats of expression pattern analysis&quot; in the Discussion.</p>
