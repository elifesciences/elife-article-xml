<abstract>
<title>Abstract</title><p>The classical diagnosis of Parkinsonism is based on motor symptoms that are the consequence of nigrostriatal pathway dysfunction and reduced dopaminergic output. However, a decade prior to the emergence of motor issues, patients frequently experience non-motor symptoms, such as a reduced sense of smell (hyposmia). The cellular and molecular bases for these early defects remain enigmatic. To explore this, we developed a new collection of five fruit fly models of familial Parkinsonism and conducted single-cell RNA sequencing on young brains of these models. Interestingly, cholinergic projection neurons are the most vulnerable cells and genes associated with presynaptic function are the most deregulated. Additional single nucleus sequencing of three specific brain regions of Parkinson’s disease patients confirms these findings. Indeed, the disturbances lead to early synaptic dysfunction, notably affecting cholinergic olfactory projection neurons crucial for olfactory function in flies. Correcting these defects specifically in olfactory cholinergic interneurons in flies or inducing cholinergic signaling in Parkinson mutant human induced dopaminergic neurons <italic>in vitro</italic> using nicotine, both rescue age-dependent dopaminergic neuron decline. Hence, our research uncovers that one of the earliest indicators of disease in 5 different models of familial Parkinsonism is synaptic dysfunction in higher-order cholinergic projection neurons and this contributes to the development of hyposmia. Furthermore, the shared pathways of synaptic failure in these cholinergic neurons ultimately contribute to dopaminergic dysfunction later in life.</p>

<title>Summary of Updates:</title>
<fn fn-type="update"><p>Below, we summarize the key revisions and additional data addressing the reviewers' main concerns
1.Validation of our negative geotaxis assay as a measure of dopaminergic neuron function: We have strengthened our argument for the use of the startle-induced negative geotaxis (SING) assay as a robust behavioral indicator of PAM dopaminergic neuron (PAM DAN) function. Prior studies had already shown a correlation between the synaptic innervation strength of these neurons and SING defects (Riemensperger et al., 2013) and our own recent findings are now also in further strong support. We found a very positive correlation between SING impairments, PAM dopaminergic synaptic deficits across numerous fly mutants. Furthermore, the SING defects are rescue by L-DOPA in PD mutants. These data are available in a BioRxiv posted paper (Kaempf et al., 2024).
2.Link between OPN dysfunction and DAN deficits later in life: We have added substantial new data (new Figure 6) showing that young PD mutants exhibit olfactory projection neuron (OPN) dysfunction without DAN impairments, while aged mutants display both. Rescuing OPN function using wild type gene expression with GH146-Gal4 in OPN, restored DAN function in aged mutants, indicating a cell non-autonomous effect of OPN on DAN function later in life. We also used nicotine treatment, that activates cholinergic receptors (and thus mimics the activity of OPN) and show that also rescues DAN defects while leaving OPN-associated abnormalities unaffected.
3.Human iPSC-derived dopaminergic neurons: To extend our findings beyond flies, we generated human induced dopaminergic neurons from iPSCs carrying the LRRK2G2019S mutation. Nicotine treatment rescued the LRRK2G2019S -mutant-induced defects, as measured by calcium imaging. This rescue was specific to nicotine, as it was abolished by co-incubation with mecamylamine, a non-competitive antagonist of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (new Figure 6). This new data indicate that cholinergic transmission is not only beneficial for fly DAN but also for induced human DAN.
4.Role of cholinergic signaling: We have clarified the expression pattern of GH146-Gal4, which includes both OPNs and APL neurons. While APL neuron contributions cannot be excluded, our data highlight the critical role of cholinergic signaling in preserving DAN function, as evidenced by the ability of nicotine to restore dopamine-related activity and behavior.
In addition to these data-focused revisions, we have carefully addressed all suggestions and questions of the reviewers and clarified key points where needed to improve the manuscript's readability and precision.</p></fn>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a complex multifactorial neurodegenerative disease that affects millions. Dopaminergic neuron (DAN) death in the <italic>Substantia nigra</italic> causes motor defects in patients. However, 97 % of patients suffer from non-motoric dysfunction decades earlier, including constipation, REM sleep disorder and hyposmia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Ansari &amp; Johnson, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Chase &amp; Markopoulou, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Doty et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Parkinson, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Schapira et al., 2017</xref>). These non-motor defects in PD are often overlooked because they occur before disease diagnosis and thus, they do not belong to the normal clinical work-up. Furthermore, non-motoric defects are largely non-responsive to dopamine replacement therapy suggesting other cell types are involved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Kalia &amp; Lang, 2015</xref>).</p>
<p>Hyposmia, the reduced ability to discern odors, is one of the earliest defects associated with familial and sporadic Parkinsonism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Chase &amp; Markopoulou, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Doty, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Doty et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Haehner et al., 2009</xref>). These patients show difficulties to classify odors: they often perceive banana odor as motor oil or beer odor as fruit in standardized odor identification tests (UPSIT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Double et al., 2003</xref>). These observations suggest that hyposmia in Parkinsonism is caused by a defect in higher-order perception, consistent with the observations that first-order olfactory receptor cells of the nasal epithelium are not majorly affected in patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Mueller et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">Witt et al., 2009</xref>). The synaptic site of second-order olfactory neurons, the olfactory bulb, is modulated by basal forebrain cholinergic neurons and local GABAergic and dopaminergic interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Harvey &amp; Heinbockel, 2018</xref>). While these DAN do not degenerate in Parkinsonism, it has been suggested there is local impairment of cholinergic transmission in the olfactory bulb of Parkinsonism patients and vertebrate models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Huisman et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Mundiñano et al., 2013</xref>; S. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c97">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>), but the molecular defects are elusive.</p>
<p>There are only few models to study hyposmia in Parkinsonism and most are based on the use of toxins or expression of mutant alpha-Synuclein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Taguchi et al., 2020</xref>). While this may recapitulate aspects of the disease, they bias the disease mechanisms to known phenomena associated with the specific model. Modelling approaches to Parkinsonism are further hindered due to the large number of mutated genes. These mutations affect various biological functions and therefore it is currently hard to unveil the specific and possibly common pathways and cell types that are at the basis of the early defects in the disease. So far, mutations in more than 25 genes have been identified that cause familial forms of Parkinsonism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Brooker et al., 2024</xref>). These genes cause defects in a diverse range of processes including mitochondrial function, endocytosis, lysosomal function, autophagy and protein translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Kalia &amp; Lang, 2015</xref>). Nonetheless, these mutations do result in overlapping motor and non-motor defects, including hyposmia. This raises the question of whether defective mechanisms across the genetic space of Parkinsonism converge on common biological processes and affect similar cell types beyond DAN. While we are in the process of generating a comprehensive collection of fruit flies with PD knock-out and knock-in mutations (see also (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Kaempf et al., 2024</xref>)), this study focuses on the first five <italic>Drosophila</italic> Parkinsonism models. Using these models, we investigated cellular and molecular dysfunctions that precede motor defects and find that early cholinergic projection neuron problems contribute to dopaminergic system failure later in life. The mutants included in this study are “classical” Parkinson disease genes, like <italic>LRRK2</italic> and <italic>PINK1</italic>, and Parkinsonism genes that affect vesicle trafficking processes, including <italic>SYNJ1, DNAJC6/Aux</italic> and <italic>RAB39B.</italic> Additionally, we also analyzed postmortem brain samples from idiopathic patients with <italic>LRRK2</italic> variants and iPSC derived human dopaminergic neurons with a pathogenic <italic>LRRK2</italic> mutation.</p>

<title>A new collection of five familial PD knock-in models</title>
<p>The characterization of cells and pathways affected in PD is hindered because patient populations are heterogeneous and because mutations in numerous genes have been linked to familial forms of the disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Brooker et al., 2024</xref>). To overcome these problems, we created a new collection of <italic>Drosophila</italic> PD knock-in models carrying pathogenic mutations using a genetic standardized and controlled design, enabling direct side-by-side comparative analyses. Additionally, these were extensively backcrossed into one isogenic background (&gt;10 generations) and did not rely on overexpression of proteins (e.g. α-Synuclein). We selected homologues of 5 PD genes and replaced the <italic>Drosophila lrrk, rab39, auxilin (aux), synaptojanin (synj)</italic> and <italic>pink1</italic> genes by wild-type and pathogenic mutant human or <italic>Drosophila</italic> cDNA sequences (CDS) at the endogenous locus (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>; <italic>wild-type hPINK1</italic> was a UAS construct; see methods). We confirm that the wild-type and pathogenic mutant human CDS (<italic>LRRK2, RAB39B</italic> and <italic>PINK1</italic>) or <italic>Drosophila</italic> CDS (<italic>DNAJC6 (Aux)</italic> and <italic>SYNJ1</italic> (<italic>Synj)</italic>) are expressed at endogenous levels (Supplemental Fig. 1a, Supplemental File 1). To determine if our new models recapitulate known PD-relevant phenotypes, we tested them in an array of assays that were previously used to analyze other fly PD models. Wild-type knock-ins are similar to controls (background fly line), indicating the cDNA knock-ins (human or fly) recapitulate normal gene function. Conversely, the PD knock-in models show defects akin to those seen in previously described mutants of these genes. For example, we find disturbances in mitochondrial membrane potential and electrophysiological defects in electroretinogram (ERG) recordings of flies stressed by exposure to constant light for 7 days (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Hindle et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Morais et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Mortiboys et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Ng et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Vanhauwaert et al., 2017</xref>) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>, Supplemental Fig. 1b-d). Note that this specific experimental ERG setup differs from studies involving the progressive aging of PD mutant flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Jacquemyn et al., 2023</xref>). Importantly, we also tested the flies for their performance in a startle-induced negative geotaxis assay (SING). This is a motor behavior that depends on central brain dopaminergic neurons (<bold>p</bold>osterior-<bold>a</bold>nterior-<bold>m</bold>edial dopaminergic neurons (DAN): “PAM”). Previous work showed that PAM-dependent SING was unaffected in young flies that express α-Synuclein, but that SING declines as these flies age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Riemensperger et al., 2013</xref>). Similarly, none of our models shows a SING defect at a young age (5 d, young) (Fig.1b). However, as flies get older (25 d, old), the PD knock-ins display impaired performance in this DAN-dependent locomotion assay, while the performance of controls is not affected (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>). This is in line with recent work where we show that SING defects in PD mutant models are rescued when the flies are fed L-DOPA but not D-DOPA indicating a very strong correlation between SING defects and defects in dopaminergic synaptic innervation of PAM DAN onto Mushroom body neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Kaempf et al., 2024</xref>). Taken together, our data suggests that the mutants we used in this study suffer from a progressive locomotion defect that is linked to DAN synapse dysfunction.</p>

<title>Cholinergic olfactory projection neurons are impaired across 5 PD mutant fly models</title>
<p>To define cell types affected by pathogenic PD mutations early in life, we used an unbiased approach and conducted single cell RNA sequencing of entire brains of young (5 d) animals (Supplemental File 2). We pooled 108k newly sequenced cells from these 5 mutants and controls with the 118k wild-type cells from our original atlas leading to 186 cell clusters, of which 81 were annotated to known cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Davie et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Janssens et al., 2022</xref>) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>). PD mutant cells equally mix with the cells of the original fly brain cell atlas and the frequency of recovered cell types is similar between control and mutant brains (including DAN; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b-f</xref>, Supplemental Fig. 2a, b; Supplemental File 3. We further do not find any cell type that shows higher or lower expression of the knocked-in CDS (Supplemental Fig. 2c). Thus, cellular identity and cellular composition are preserved in young PD fly models.</p>

<p>For every cluster, we then compared gene expression between cells from mutants and controls using two independent algorithms (Wilcoxon and DESEQ2, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">Wang et al., 2019</xref>)) and find both methods correlate well (average Spearman correlation of signed p-value &gt; 0.8 to &gt; 0.95; Supplemental Fig. 2d). However, the number of differentially expressed genes (DEG) is largely dependent on the number of cells present in a cluster. To correct this bias, we fitted a negative binomial model that correlated the number of DEG and cell cluster size in each mutant (Supplemental Fig. 2e, Supplemental File 4). Using the residuals of this model we find eight common predominantly affected cell types across the 5 mutants (Supplemental File 5 and 6). We also find cell types uniquely affected in some mutants, e.g., glial subtypes that were affected in <italic>PINK1<sup>P399L</sup></italic>. The commonly affected cell types include cholinergic olfactory projection neurons (OPN), Kenyon cells, cholinergic neurons of the visual system (T1 neurons), and other yet-to-be-identified cell types (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b-f</xref>, black cells; Supplemental File 6). Hence, while our mutants are modelling different genetic origins of disease, we find some cell types are commonly affected. While several cell types are affected (and many are cholinergic), OPN are here of particular interest because they are higher-order projection neurons that control innate olfactory processing and odor classification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Masse et al., 2009</xref>).</p>

<title>Synaptic genes and pathways are deregulated in cholinergic brain regions of fly PD models and human PD patients</title>
<p>We next compared the identity of the DEG found in PD fly model cholinergic olfactory projection neurons to the identity of the (homologous) genes differentially expressed in patient brain samples rich in cholinergic neurons. We analyzed <italic>nucleus basalis of Meynert</italic> (NBM)<italic>, nucleus accumbens</italic> (Nac) and <italic>putamen</italic> (Put) from five brains of PD patients (all have idiopathic <italic>LRRK2</italic> risk mutations) and five brains from unaffected age-matched individuals (without PD-relevant genetic variants). Our analysis identified 37 distinct cell types in these brain regions (Supplemental Fig. 3a), and most of the cell types have a similar frequency when comparing PD vs non-PD condition. An exception is a microglia subtype (MG #20, Supplemental Fig. 3b), which is 900% increased in frequency in PD patient brains compared to non-PD samples. We next analyzed all neuronal subtypes in these samples (Supplemental Fig. 3c, d) and identified the DEG. Many of the DEG are genes encoding synaptic proteins that are also listed in the synapse-specific portal SynGo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Koopmans et al., 2019</xref>) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>, a’; Supplemental File 7). We then asked how they compare to the DEG found in affected cholinergic projection neurons of our five fly models (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>”; Supplemental File 7). We therefore first listed the deregulated genes in affected cell types for each fly model. There are many DEG unique to each PD mutant, but there is also overlap in DEG between the models. To define this overlap across fly PD mutants, we ranked genes according to their signed differential expression for each of the 5 PD models (up or downregulated) and then summed their rank across the mutants retaining the genes in the top 5% and the bottom 5% as the common highly up- or downregulated genes (Supplemental File 7); i.e. only if the DEGs are mostly commonly up- or commonly down-regulated they end up at the top or bottom of our list. Additionally, when we compare this list of deregulated fly genes to the DEG-orthologues in PD patients, there is remarkable overlap. For example, in the NBM, an area associated with PD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Arendt et al., 1983</xref>), &gt;20% of the neuronal DEG that have an orthologous gene in the fly are also found among the most deregulated genes across PD fly models. This is highly significant: of the 2486 significantly differentially expressed human genes, 1149 have a fly orthologue, and of these, 28.46% overlap with the deregulated fly genes (5% top and bottom genes listed in Supplemental File 7). Performing a hypergeometric test confirms that this overlap is significant (<italic>p</italic>, 9.06e-<sup>76</sup>). Next, we analyzed the list of human-fly overlapping DEG using Gorilla gene ontology enrichment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Eden et al., 2009</xref>). Markedly, this shows that the processes most strikingly enriched in both fly models and human NBM are those related to synaptic function (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref>). Indeed, more than half of the DEG found in human and flies are present in the synapse-specific portal SynGo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Koopmans et al., 2019</xref>) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>”; Supplemental File 7). We found enrichment for presynaptic function, including synaptic exocytosis, axon guidance, synapse organization, ion transport and protein homeostasis (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b, c</xref>). Additionally, we also found enrichment of genes involved in RNA regulation and mitochondrial function that are also important for the functioning of synaptic terminals (Supplemental File 7) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Gorenberg &amp; Chandra, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Morais et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Snead &amp; Eliezer, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Uytterhoeven et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">Verstreken et al., 2005</xref>). Of note, while the human samples all have <italic>LRRK2</italic> variant mutations, comparing the vulnerable gene signatures from each of the PD fly models to the DEGs from the human samples does not show any greater similarity between the <italic>LRRK2</italic> mutants compared to the other PD mutants (Supplemental File 7). In summary, cholinergic olfactory neurons of young familial fly PD models and human PD patients both show preferential transcriptional deregulation of genes that regulate synaptic function.</p>

<title>Young PD models suffer from synaptic impairment of cholinergic OPN</title>
<p>The transcriptional deregulation of genes encoding synaptic proteins suggests synaptic alterations in the affected cell types. We therefore expressed the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensor GCaMP3 in the OPN, one of the majorly affected cell types in our PD flies, and monitored synaptic terminal function through a small window in the head capsule of living flies upon stimulation (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4a, b</xref>). Neuronal stimulation results in a robust synaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal at OPN synapses in controls (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4c, d</xref> (black points), quantified in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4g</xref> (gray bar)) and in animals with the wild-type PD gene knocked-in (e.g. hLRRK2 in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4c, d</xref> (dark red points), quantified in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4g</xref> (left bar)).

Next, we tested if this defect is cell-autonomous and created PD mutant knock-ins expressing the wild-type CDS in their OPN using GH146-Gal4 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4g</xref> (right bar; “OPN&gt;wt CDS +”)). Even though this Gal4 driver also drives expression in one pair of inhibitory APL neurons (GABAergic neurons that we did not recover in our single cell sequencing), it mostly expresses in OPN enabling us to assess PD gene function in OPN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Li et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Liu &amp; Davis, 2009</xref>). PD mutants expressing wild-type PD genes using GH146-Gal4 show synaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals similar to controls, indicating the PD genes are required in OPN of these young animals to maintain robust synaptic function (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4g</xref> (right bar; “OPN&gt;wt CDS +”).

<p>Previous work indicated that functional defects of OPN often cause morphological changes at the level of the synaptic area in the calyx (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Kremer et al., 2010</xref>). We thus also assessed the synaptic area of OPN in the calyx (based on the GFP fluorescence area of the GCaMP3 sensor). Interestingly, the PD mutants have a significantly larger area compared to controls, despite very similar GFP expression levels (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4e, f, h</xref>). Again, this defect is cell-autonomous, because it is rescued by OPN-selective expression of the wild-type CDS, except -again- for <italic>LRRK2<sup>G2019S</sup></italic> agreeing with it being a dominant mutant (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4h</xref>). Thus, OPN of young PD mutants display cell-autonomous presynaptic defects: even though the synaptic area is increased, synaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals are diminished.</p>

<title>Hyposmia is prevalent in young PD models</title>
<p>While old (25 d) PD mutants show PAM-dependent locomotion dysfunction in the SING assay (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref> (SING old)), young (5 d) PD mutants do not show SING defects (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref> (SING young)).

<p>We then asked if this defect is cell-autonomous and expressed the relevant wild-type CDS <italic>selectively</italic> in the OPN of the pathogenic knock-in mutant flies.

However, the <italic>LRRK2<sup>G2019S</sup></italic> mutant remains unaffected, consistent with its classification as a dominant mutant. Note that <italic>lrrk<sup>KO</sup></italic>flies also show an olfactory performance defect (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5c, d</xref>; “-”) and that expressing <italic>hLRRK2</italic> cDNA specifically in the OPN of <italic>lrrk<sup>KO</sup></italic> rescues this defect (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5c, d</xref>; “OPN&gt;hLRRK2 +”, green label). This indicates hLRRK2 is a functional protein that, in this context, can compensate for the function of the fly orthologue. Finally, we demonstrate that the rescue of the olfactory performance in PD mutants is specific for OPN, because expressing wild-type CDS in another affected cell type, “T1-interneurons of the visual system”, of knock-in PD animals (we chose to test this in <italic>Rab39B<sup>G192R</sup></italic> mutants), does not improve olfactory performance (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5c, d</xref>; “T1&gt;hRab39B +”, red label).

<title>Rescuing OPN dysfunction in young PD mutants prevents DAN defects at older age</title>
<p>Our data indicates that young PD mutants (<italic>aux, synj and LRRK2</italic>) have olfactory defects while displaying normal DAN function (SING). Conversely, aged <italic>aux<sup>R927G</sup>, synj<sup>R258Q</sup></italic> and <italic>hLRRK2<sup>G2019S</sup></italic> knock-in animals exhibit both olfactory preference defects and progressive DAN (SING) dysfunction (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6a</xref>; line graphs; “DAN-dependent movement behavior”). We also assessed the synaptic afferent innervation area of PAM DAN onto mushroom bodies by quantifying the area of anti-TH labeling. In line with the SING behavioral defect, all three 25-day-old knock-in mutants show a significant reduction in DAN afferent (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6a</xref>, left bar; “OPN&gt;wt CDS -”; “DAN synapse morphology”). We then wondered if rescuing OPN at young age affects DAN at later age. We therefore expressed the wild-type PD gene in (a.o.) OPN of <italic>aux<sup>R927G</sup></italic>and <italic>synj<sup>R258Q</sup></italic> mutants using the GH146-Gal4 (that does not drive expression in DAN) (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6a</xref>, right bar; “OPN&gt;wt CDS +”; “DAN synapse morphology”). Given that <italic>hLRRK2<sup>G2019S</sup></italic> is dominant, we did not express the wild-type <italic>hLRRK2</italic> in OPN, but <italic>endoA<sup>S75D</sup></italic> that we showed previously, genetically interacts with <italic>lrrk</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Matta et al., 2012</xref>) (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6a</xref>, right bar; “OPN&gt;endoA<sup>S75D</sup> +”; “DAN synapse morphology”). We find these genetic manipulations rescue the DAN-associated SING and synaptic connectivity defects in old PD mutants (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6a</xref>). Altogether, these results suggest that functional OPN have a cell non-autonomous effect to prevent DAN dysfunction that emerges at old age in the PD mutants. To further substantiate this observation, we also conducted a set of independent experiments where we fed <italic>hLRRK2<sup>G20190S</sup></italic> mutants nicotine. Nicotine activates the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors that, under normal circumstances, are also activated by the release of acetylcholine from cholinergic neurons, including OPN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Chambers et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Changeux, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c98">Zhou et al., 2001</xref>). While feeding nicotine does not rescue the olfactory preference defect of <italic>hLRRK2<sup>G2019S</sup></italic> mutants, it also does not rescue the OPN synapse morphology defect or the OPN-associated defects in synaptic Ca-imaging (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6b</xref>). Interestingly, nicotine does rescue the DAN-associated defects, including SING, synapse loss and defects in Ca-imaging at DAN synapses (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6c</xref>).

This effect is specific to nicotine as no rescue was observed when cells were co-incubated with mecamylamine, a non-competitive antagonist of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, trumping the effects of nicotine (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6e</xref>). Hence, the positive effect of nicotine on PD mutants is conserved between flies and iPSC-derived dopaminergic neurons.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Parkinsonism is currently diagnosed based on motor defects that only occur following significant DAN degeneration. However, patients suffer from non-motoric problems decades earlier, including sleep problems and hyposmia (the inability to properly discern odors) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93">Yamakado &amp; Takahashi, 2024</xref>). Most of these non-motoric problems are not responsive to dopamine replacement therapy, suggesting other transmitter systems are involved. Using unbiased methodology, we find cholinergic system failure as one of the earliest defects across 5 different Parkinsonism fly models and we show that synaptic failure of specific cholinergic projection neurons (OPN) causes non-motor problems, including hyposmia. Also in patients, cholinergic defects in several brain regions have been observed, including the olfactory bulb and the occipital cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Kuhl et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Shimada et al., 2009</xref>). These defects correlate with several non-motor symptoms, including impaired olfactory and visual processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Bohnen et al., 2010</xref>). We now place cholinergic failure firmly ahead of dopaminergic system failure in flies, and we suggest that dysfunction of specific cholinergic projection neurons may be a prodromal signal of disease. Our work opens the possibility to explore the early detection of specific cholinergic interneuron dysfunction, e.g. using PET tracing, as an entry point to move diagnosis and intervention ahead of dopaminergic degeneration.</p>
<p>The connection between early cholinergic neuron dysfunction and subsequent failure of the DAN system in disease progression remains uncertain. However, dopaminergic neurons have a high density of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, and evidence suggests that stimulating these receptors enhances DAN survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Brimblecombe et al., 2018</xref>). This is supported by epidemiological data indicating that nicotine exposure from chronic smoking protects against PD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Janssens et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">Wang et al., 2019</xref>), and various studies, including the work we present here, show that direct nicotine supplementation mitigates DAN dysfunction in mouse and fly PD models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Chambers et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Fares et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Olsen et al., 2023</xref>). We also demonstrate this with a genetics experiment where we express wild-type PD genes in OPN and observe rescue of DAN dysfunction in older flies. These findings imply that factors affecting the function of OPN or cholinergic neurons might, by absence of insufficient innervation or activity, lead to DAN problems and degeneration, warranting further exploration of the underlying molecular mechanisms.</p>
<p>Our findings reveal a common trigger relevant for both familial and idiopathic cases. Observations of Lewy body pathology in postmortem samples suggest the disease may nucleate at specific sites and then propagate. This includes spreading of the disease between the gut and the brain as well as early aggregation of alpha-Synuclein, a synaptic protein, in the olfactory bulb (Braak, Tredici, et al., 2003). The presence of protein aggregates in these areas is consistent with protein homeostasis and synaptic defects that ultimately contribute to the aggregation of alpha-Synuclein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Chu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Friedman et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Sarkar et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">Webb et al., 2003</xref>). In idiopathic disease, there is some evidence this is because the gut and olfactory bulb synapses are more easily exposed to environmental toxins that cause protein misfolding and aggregation (Braak, Rüb, et al., 2003). Furthermore, we also find genetic interactions with the protein turnover machinery that warrant further investigation (this study and (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Matta et al., 2012</xref>)). However, different mechanisms may be at play since our single-cell sequencing shows the deregulation of several synaptic pathways in the PD knock-in mutants. While several genes mutated in familial forms of PD have proposed synaptic functions (endocytosis, synaptic autophagy, etc.), others may be affecting the synapse indirectly (e.g. mitochondria, transport, etc.). Future work will now need to elucidate which synaptic processes are affected and how this has an impact on cholinergic projection neuron function and cholinergic transmission.</p>

<title>Strengths and caveats to our approach</title>
<sec id="s3a1">
<title>Strengths</title>
<p>In this work, we generated new <italic>Drosophila</italic> PD models using a controlled and standardized design to introduce pathogenic mutant PD variants at the endogenous locus. With this approach, the gene regulatory environment is as much as possible preserved ensuring that our models are physiological relevant, circumventing overexpression artifacts or ectopic effects. By studying these mutations in their endogenous context, we can better understand their specific contributions to transcriptional and cellular phenotypes. Given that the mutants are generated in a controlled ‘isogenic’ fashion, it is now possible to conduct careful side-by-side comparisons of different PD mutant genotypes.</p>
<p>Analyzing these newly generated PD models at young age using single-cell RNA sequencing enables us to identify affected cell populations and uncover early molecular events that might precede overt neurodegenerative disease phenotypes. Furthermore, the comparison between our fly PD models and human patient brain samples provides evidence that some of the molecular mechanisms of disease are conserved across species.</p>
<p>Finally, our <italic>in vivo</italic> investigations enabled us to uncover cell-non-autonomous effects of cholinergic projection neurons onto the fly dopaminergic system, a feat that would have been difficult to discover in <italic>in vitro</italic> (mono-) human neuron cultures.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s3a2">
<title>Caveats</title>
<p>One of the caveats in our study involves the use of the GH146-Gal4 line. GH146-dependent Gal expression includes OPNs (that are cholinergic) and one pair of inhibitory APL neurons (that are GABAergic). There are only 2 APL per fly brain and our single cell sequencing experiment does not have the resolution to allow us to test if these neurons had a significant number of DEG. However, we are able to rescue DAN dysfunction by mimicking cholinergic output (using nicotine). These data do not exclude that APL-neuron problems contribute to the defects we observe in our PD mutants, but they do suggest that cholinergic output is critical to maintain normal DAN function.</p>
<p>Another caveat involves the temporal mismatch of comparing single-cell RNA sequencing data obtained from young PD models versus postmortem end-stage human disease tissue. Indeed, there may be changes in early stages that may not completely align with the late-stage disease profiles typically observed in human postmortem samples. Unfortunately, obtaining human brain samples from PD patients at an early stage are rare, these samples would have been more relevant to be compared to our young PD models. Nonetheless, we do also find that cholinergic neurons from postmortem brain samples have similar affected DEG pointing to similar affected molecular pathways when comparing to our young PD fly data.</p>

<title>Experimental model details</title>
<p>The “control” we refer to is a semi-isogenized <italic>w<sup>1118</sup></italic>backcrossed to CantonS for 10 generations (cantonized <italic>w<sup>1118</sup></italic>). We sequenced the entire genome of the resulting fly line and defined there are no deleterious mutations in homologues of known causative Parkinson’s disease genes or in homologues of human genes located close to GWAS loci. All our knock-ins (see below), UAS (see below) and Gal4 lines were backcrossed for &gt;10 generations to this control. All generated fly lines were verified by multiple PCRs and PCR-product sequencing.</p>
<p>Flies were reared on standard yeast food medium at 25 °C and kept on 12/12 h light/dark cycles. Flies were kept in mixed populations of analogous density and were flipped onto fresh food every three days. Brains for RNA experiments, including single cell sequencing, were dissected between 11 and 12 h Zeitgeber time, behavioral and physiology experiments were performed between 18 and 20 h Zeitgeber time. Males and females were tested together, quantified separately, and results pooled if there was no statistical difference. Male hPINK1 pathogenic mutant knock-in flies are sterile, requiring balancing of the stock and consequently they produce only male hemizygotes to be quantified in experiments.</p>

<title>Generation of <italic>Drosophila</italic> PD models</title>
<p>A complete list of primers, gRNAs, oligos, gBlocks and fly strains is listed in Supplemental File 1. To clone inserts into plasmids NEBuilder® HiFi DNA Assembly (NEB) was used.</p>
<p>Unique gRNAs for <italic>LRRK2</italic>, <italic>PINK1</italic>, <italic>Rab39B, Aux</italic> and <italic>Synj</italic> were identified by <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://crispr.mit.edu/">http://crispr.mit.edu/</ext-link> and introduced into pCFD4: U6:1-gRNA U6:3-gRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Port et al., 2014</xref>) by following an established protocol: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.crisprflydesign.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Cloning-with-pCFD4.pdf">http://www.crisprflydesign.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Cloning-with-pCFD4.pdf</ext-link>.</p>
<p>Homology arms of 1 kB surrounding the first common exon of the different transcripts from the gene of interest were cloned into pWhite-STAR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Choi et al., 2009</xref>). For <italic>Aux</italic>, homology arms surrounded the entire <italic>Aux</italic> gene. HiFi DNA Assembly (NEB) was performed with four fragments: mini-white IMCE-cassette, left homology arm, right homology arm and the plasmid backbone. The homology arms were either generated by gBlocks (IDT), which were modified in order to make them compatible with the requirements of IDT, or amplified by Q5 PCR from genomic fly DNA of the target genotype (cantonized <italic>w<sup>1118</sup></italic>). The mini-white IMCE-cassette and vector backbone were generated by restriction digest on pWhite-STAR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Choi et al., 2009</xref>) with AvrII and XhoI. In order to avoid cutting of the donor plasmid, the PAM sequence of the target was mutated, if located in the homology arms. Mostly NGG to NAA modifications were used, however different modifications were used when necessary (presence of PAM in coding region). The donor plasmids pDoC-miniwhite-gene (Donor cassette) contains an Integrase mediated exchange (IMCE) cassette surrounded by two homology arms that allows for HDR (homology directed repair). HDR occurs when two double strand breaks are introduced in the DNA surrounding the first (or second) common exon of all transcripts. This HDR replaced the first common exon by the IMCE-cassette. Site of HDR was directed by the choice of the homology arms in a way such that the two attP sites for IMCE were situated inside evolutionary non-conserved regions.</p>
<p>Rescue plasmids were used to exchange the mini-white IMCE-cassette with the coding DNA sequence (CDS) of target genes. All rescue plasmids contain: 1) a stretch of genomic sequence that will be referred to as ‘utr’: this sequence was deleted together with the removed exon of the target gene and now is being placed back to repair the locus; 2) CDS of the target gene and 3) a poly(A)-tail. These 3 elements are surrounded by two attB sites. The rescue plasmids are named pReC-<italic>gene</italic> or pReC2-<italic>gene</italic> and are target gene-specific. The backbone: pReC was generated by linearizing pUC19 with SapI and EcoRI followed by insertion of two gBlocks: attB-MCS-L and MCS-attB-R. We also created pReC2, an optimized version that allows for easier cloning of the utr and CDS as it already contains the SV40 poly(A), by linearizing pUC19 with SapI and EcoRI followed by insertion of two gBlocks: attB-2xMCS-L and 2xMCS-attB-R.</p>
<p>Note that while for <italic>LRRK2, RAB39B</italic> and <italic>PINK1</italic> knock-in models we used human CDS, for <italic>aux</italic> and <italic>synj</italic> we resorted to <italic>Drosophila</italic> CDS, since knock-in of the human homologues at the locus of these genes did not rescue its loss-of-function (lethality).</p>

<p>pReC was linearized with SapI. gBlock LRRK2:utr-P2A-SapI-SV40, containing the utr a P2A site (since we knocked-out exon 2), SapI restriction site (for subsequent cloning of the CDS) and an SV40 poly(A)) was introduced.

This plasmid is linearized with SapI. Next the CDS of human <italic>PINK1</italic> was amplified from pLenti6-DEST PINK1-V5 WT with F_hPink1_cDNA and R_hPINK1_cDNA and introduced into the linearized plasmid. The resulting plasmid is called pReC-hPINK1. pReC-hPINK1R145Q and pReC-hPINK1L347P were created by using Q5® Site-Directed Mutagenesis (NEB) with primers F_mut_PINK1_L347P, R_mut_PINK1_L347P and F_mut_PINK1_P399L, R_mut_PINK1_P399L respectively on pReC-hPINK1. While we created wild-type CDS knock-ins for rescue experiments and knock-ins carrying the pathogenic mutant variants of all Parkinson’s disease models (including the <italic>Pink1</italic> mutant knock-ins), we were unsuccessful in targeting the wild-type human <italic>PINK1</italic> CDS to the fly <italic>pink1</italic> locus, unlike the two pathogenic variants. Therefore, the <italic>Pink1</italic> control we used was generated by neuronally expressing human <italic>PINK1</italic> with UAS-hPINK1 and nsyb-Gal4 (Yang et al 2003) in the <italic>Pink1<sup>KO</sup></italic> background (full genotype: <italic>w<sup>1118</sup> Pink1<sup>K.O</sup>.;UAS-hPINK1/+; nSyb-Gal4/+</italic>).</p>

<p>CellRanger generated a gene expression matrix, which was used as input for VSN pipelines (Zenodo, v0.27.0) (Flerin et al., 2021) for the first filtering and data clean up. These pipelines are written in Nextflow DSL2 making them highly reproducible, and the config file used for the fly samples can be found in Supplemental File 2. The VSN pipeline removed predicted doublets using scrublet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">Wolock et al., 2019</xref>), followed by a cleaning of ambient RNA reads using DecontX (S. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c94">Yang et al., 2020</xref>), similar to the procedures used in the Fly Cell Atlas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Li et al., 2022</xref>).</p>
<p>Afterwards the data was loaded into scanpy (1.8.2, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">Wolf et al., 2018</xref>)). Cells were filtered using min_genes=200, max_genes=7000, min_counts=500 and max_counts=30000, and finally with percentage of mitochondrial counts below 15. The data were log-normalized with a scale factor of 10<sup>4</sup> and scaled (maximum values = 10), regressing out the number of UMIs and the percentage of mitochondrial genes as latent variables using a linear regression model. Highly variable genes were selected using sc.pp.highly_variable_genes with default parameters.</p>
<p>We used sc.tl.pca to calculate 250 principal components on the highly variable genes, from which the first 100 components were selected for follow-up analysis based on an elbow plot. Since the data contains many samples (n=65) covering a variety of different ages and genotypes, we noticed batch effects and low mixing with default parameters. Therefore, we used Harmony (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Korsunsky et al., 2019</xref>) to correct the principal components. For this we used sce.pp.harmony_integrate with max_iter_harmony=20, using the genotype + age combination as batch variable.

To start annotating these and to find a final clustering resolution, we compared the detected clusters with the annotations from the co-clustered published dataset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Davie et al., 2018</xref>) and annotations from the Fly Cell Atlas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Li et al., 2022</xref>). In addition, we also used the neural net classifier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Davie et al., 2018</xref>) using default parameters as described. Finally, we compared the clusters with sorted cell types from (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Davis et al., 2020</xref>) using lasso regression as described below. These data were used to annotate clusters in resolution 20, after which clusters with the same annotation were merged. For unknown cells, we chose to use Leiden resolution 5 as basis annotation to not split clusters too much and keep enough cells to perform meaningful differential expression analysis.</p>
<p>In total we found 188 clusters, of which 83 were annotated (median size = 1,011 cells, total = 140,778 cells) and 105 unknown (median size = 810 cells, total = 145,010 cells).</p>

<title>Lasso regression</title>
<p>To expand the published atlas, we analyzed the bulk transcriptomes of multiple FAC-sorted neuronal cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Davie et al., 2018</xref>). Regression models have been previously used to compare bulk transcriptome profiles to aggregated cluster profiles, including non-negative least squares (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Davie et al., 2018</xref>). Here we use lasso regression to predict single cell cluster transcriptome profiles using the bulk profiles as variables. Therefore, each single cell cluster is decomposed as a weighted sum of bulk profiles. The regularization of the lasso model, allows for a higher signal to noise ratio and clearer assignments. Clear matches between a cluster and a bulk profile are detected as high coefficients (&gt;0.1) in the sum. The regression model was fit using gene signatures derived from Scanpy as features. Before fitting, all datasets were scaled to counts per million CPM using the common genes, independent of previously applied normalization techniques. The calculations were performed using the SciPy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">Virtanen et al., 2020</xref>) and Scikit-learn packages in Python.</p>

<title>Calling SNPs</title>
<p>In the human data, 10 different genotypes (5 PD cases, 5 controls) were mixed across 3 regions. To perform demultiplexing, the SNPs are required per sample. Since no genotype information was available, we performed bulk RNA-seq on all samples and called SNPs on the transcriptome. For this we used BCFFtools (v1.11, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Li et al., 2022</xref>)). We performed a pileup using the common loci of the 1000 Genomes project (1000 Genomes Project Consortium et al., 2015; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Gramates et al., 2017</xref>) on the Hg38 iGenomes genome (-d 8000, -Ou), calling SNPs with the bcftools call function (-mv, -Ob). Using the reheader function we then updated the bcf file to make it compatible with demuxlet. We detected 146,848 SNPs, ranging between 25k and 51k per genotype (see table below). Next, the bcf file was sorted in the same order as the bam files and bcftools +fill-tags was used to add frequencies.</p>

<title>Demuxlet</title>
<p>Bam files were filtered using SAMtools (1.11, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Li et al., 2022</xref>)) to only contain reads overlapping with the vcf file. Then popscle dsc-pileup was used to create a pileup file for input in popscle demuxlet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Kang et al., 2018</xref>). All cells labeled as doublets were removed (∼4-7 %), and cells assigned to singlets were kept (25-43 %). Additionally, a large proportion of cells (∼49-69 %) were labelled as ambiguous. These cells were assigned to their most likely singlet identity and kept in the remaining analysis. In a next step, we only kept possible genotype-experiment combinations, ending up with 97,489 cells.</p>

<sec id="s6s">
<title>Data filtering and clustering</title>
<p>CellRanger generated a gene expression matrix of 151,368 cells. After removing doublets and wrongly assigned cells, 97,489 cells remained. The data was loaded into scanpy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">Wolf et al., 2018</xref>) and further filtered using min_genes=500, max_genes=7000, min_counts=1000 and max_counts=30000, and finally with percentage of mitochondrial counts below 5. We lowered the allowed percentage of mitochondrial counts since the human data was obtained from snRNA-seq. The data were log-normalized with a scale factor of 10<sup>4</sup> and scaled (maximum values = 10), regressing out the number of UMIs and the percentage of mitochondrial genes as latent variables using a linear regression model. Highly variable genes were selected using sc.pp.highly_variable_genes with default parameters.</p>
<p>We used sc.tl.pca to calculate 200 principal components on the highly variable genes, from which the first 75 components were selected for follow-up analysis based on an elbow plot. We again used Harmony (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Korsunsky et al., 2019</xref>) to correct the principal components for batch effects, using genotype as the batch variable. The batch effect-corrected components were then used as input to calculate neighbors using sc.pp.neighbors with n_neighbors=30, followed by Leiden clustering for resolutions between 1 and 10. Subsequently, tSNE and UMAP visualizations were calculated.</p>
<p>Using marker genes for main neuronal and glial populations we chose to combine Leiden resolution 1 for glia and Leiden resolution 3 for neurons.</p>
<p>Gene set enrichment was performed using the AUCell function from the pyscenic package (0.10.4) in Python. The genes detected in affected cell types of <italic>Drosophila</italic> models were converted to human homologues using the FlyBase database, selecting homologues with a DIOPT score&gt;=5. Significant enrichment was determined using a two-tailed t-test.</p>

<sec id="s6t">
<title>Differential expression</title>
<p>For every cluster, cells from each mutant genotype were compared against cells from the wild-type control. In the fly, OPN subtypes were merged before calculating differentially expressed genes (DEG). To control for biases in methods, we used Wilcoxon and DESEQ2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Love et al., 2014</xref>). The Wilcoxon test was performed with the scanpy wrapper sc.tl.rank_genes_groups. For DESEQ2 we used rpy2 to call the R package DESEQ2 in Python. DESEQ2 was originally designed to be used on bulk RNA-seq data. Therefore, we grouped cells into pseudobulks based on their experimental run by summing their gene expression profiles. Only pseudobulks consisting of at least 10 cells were kept. We did not select any additional variables to regress.</p>
<p>To detect any method biases, we calculated the spearman correlation of the signed p-value (log-foldchange multiplied with log(p-val)), showing that both methods differ in the exact number of DEG, but agree quite well in their ranking of up- and downregulated genes. We found larger differences in the number of DEG called in the human data (0-10 in DESEQ2, 200-1800 in Wilcoxon) but the rankings remained highly correlated (r∼0.8). The Wilcoxon test is more sensitive to genes expressed in all cells in the cluster, while DESEQ2 can be oversensitive to genes expressed in only a minor fraction of cells.</p>
<p>Additional runs were made in which the number of cells per cluster was down sampled to correct against cluster-size based biases.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s6u">
<title>Modeling of DEG</title>
<p>Since the number of DEG has been shown to be highly correlated with the number of cells in single-cell RNA-seq, we used a modeling approach to find outlier clusters with more than expected DEG. Since the data is over dispersed count data, we fit a negative binomial model to the data, with number of differential genes (nDEG) as dependent variable and number of cells in the mutant and number of cells in the control as independent variables:
<disp-formula>
<graphic xlink:href="532176v3_ueqn1.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula>
With <italic>y</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> being the number of differential genes detected in cluster i, <italic>X</italic><sub>1<italic>i</italic></sub>the log of the number of cells of cluster i in the mutant and <italic>X</italic><sub>2<italic>i</italic></sub> the number of cells of cluster i in the wildtype.</p>
<p>Models were fit using the statsmodels package in Python and goodness of fit was measured using the Log-Likelihood (Supplemental File 4). The number of UMIs per cluster was not included as independent variable, since it has been implicated with cell size and thus could remove biological effects. Residuals were calculated as the difference between the measured number of differential genes and the predicted number, wherein a positive residual means that the cluster has more differential genes than expected.

Odor vials contained: 2 ml motor oil, 2 g fresh banana, 2 ml undiluted beer (Jupiler), or 2 ml wine (LesTruffiers, 2015) diluted 1:1000. Afterwards the olfactory preference index was scored: (#flies in tube with odor A - #flies in tube with odor B)/#total flies.

Images were analyzed using Fiji (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Schindelin et al., 2012</xref>). Fluorescence intensity was quantified in a region of interest (ROI, d=10 µm) that was placed in the center of the synaptic area (calyx for OPNs, mushroom body lobes for dopaminergic PAM neurons) and normalized by subtracting background fluorescence. Basal fluorescence F<sub>0</sub> in the synaptic region was determined by averaging five frames before stimulus onset and the change of fluorescence over time was calculated by F-F<sub>0</sub>/F<sub>0</sub>.

<title>iPSC differentiation to ventral midbrain dopaminergic neurons</title>

In summary, on day -1, 400.000 hiPSCs/cm2 were seeded on Matrigel-coated wells of 6-well plates in StemFlex medium supplemented with 10 µM Rho kinase inhibitor (RI). On day 0, medium was switched to a 1:1 mix of DMEM/F-12 and Neurobasal supplemented with 0.5x N2, 0.5x B27 without vitamin A, GlutaMAX, Penstrep, non-essential amino acids, β-mercaptoethanol (10 μM) (all Life Technologies), insulin (5 μg/ml, Sigma), LDN193189 (500 nM, Sigma), SB431542 (10 μM, Tocris), SHH-C24II (200 ng/ml, Miltenyi Biotec) and Purmorphamine (1 μM, Sigma). CHIR99021 (1.5 μM, Stemcell Technologies) was added to the medium from day 3 to day 13. SB431542, SHH-C24II and Purmorphamine were withdrawn from the medium at day 9. FGF8b (100 ng/mL, Miltenyi Biotec) was added to the medium from day 9 until day 16. Cells were split 1:1 at day 11 and medium was switched to Neurobasal supplemented with 0.5x N2, 0.5x B27 without vitamin A, Penstrep, GlutaMAX. At day 16, cells were split 1:2 and the medium was switched to terminal differentiation medium consisting of Neurobasal-A supplemented with 1X B27 supplement without vitamin A, GlutaMAX, Penstrep containing BDNF (brain-derived neurotrophic factor, 10 ng/ml; Miltenyi Biotec), ascorbic acid (0.2 mM, Sigma), GDNF (glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor, 10 ng/ml; Miltenyi Biotec), dibutyryl cAMP (0.2 mM; Sigma), SR11237 (100 nM, Tocris), and DAPT (10 μM; Tocris). On day 20, ventral midbrain neural progenitors were cryopreserved and quality controlled.

<p>This is an <bold>important</bold> study demonstrating that anosmia in Parkinson's disease patients is due to dysfunction in cholinergic neurons. This study provides <bold>compelling</bold> evidence, using scRNA sequencing, that cholinergic olfactory projection neurons (OPN) are consistently affected in five different fruit fly models of Parkinson's disease, exhibiting synaptic dysfunction before the onset of motor deficits. Comparisons with scRNA sequencing of patients' human brain samples reveals similar synaptic gene deregulation in cholinergic neurons of patients. This study points the possibility that targeting cholinergic neurons could be a potential avenue for early diagnosis and intervention in PD.</p>

<p>In Pech et al. the authors take advantage of a genetic model organism to investigate the convergent impact of multiple mutations linked to Parkinson's Disease (PD). To investigate this question they leverage Drosophila genetics to create wild type and mutant alleles for five different mutations linked to PD. An additional novel focus of this work is an examination of the animals in an early phase before apparent dopaminergic degeneration. Having generated this resource, authors discover apply an impressive array of experiments including behavioural assays, calcium imaging and single-cell profiling. They also cross-validate their findings in human PD brains. Strikingly, the authors discover common dysregulated genes between fly and human that converges on synaptic dysregulation. Finally, they demonstrate that even in early timepoints, there is extensive dysfunction of olfactory projection neuron calcium.</p>
<p>This is a fantastic, comprehensive, timely and landmark pan-species work that demonstrates the convergence of multiple familial PD mutations onto a synaptic program. It is extremely well written and the authors have addressed all my comments in this review. I recommend this work be published as soon as possible.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This study investigates the cellular and molecular events leading to hyposmia, an early dysfunction in Parkinson's disease (PD), which develops up to 10 years prior to motor symptoms. The authors use five Drosophila knock-in models of familial PD genes (LRRK2, RAB39B, PINK1, DNAJC6 (Aux), and SYNJ1 (Synj)), three expressing human genes and two Drosophila genes with equivalent mutations.</p>
<p>The authors carry out single-cell RNA sequencing of young fly brains and single-nucleus RNA sequencing of human brain samples. The authors found that cholinergic olfactory projection neurons (OPN) were consistently affected across the fly models, showing synaptic dysfunction before the onset of motor deficits, known to be associated with dopaminergic neuron (DAN) dysfunction.</p>
<p>Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed significant transcriptional deregulation of synaptic genes in OPNs across all five fly PD models. This synaptic dysfunction was confirmed by impaired calcium signalling and morphological changes in synaptic OPN terminals. Furthermore, these young PD flies exhibited olfactory behavioural deficits that were rescued by selective expression of wild-type genes in OPNs.</p>
<p>Single-nucleus RNA sequencing of post-mortem brain samples from PD patients with LRRK2 risk mutations revealed similar synaptic gene deregulation in cholinergic neurons, particularly in the nucleus basalis of Meynert (NBM). Gene ontology analysis highlighted enrichment for processes related to presynaptic function, protein homeostasis, RNA regulation, and mitochondrial function.</p>
<p>This study provides compelling evidence for the early and primary involvement of cholinergic dysfunction in PD pathogenesis, preceding the canonical DAN degeneration. The convergence of familial PD mutations on synaptic dysfunction in cholinergic projection neurons suggests a common mechanism contributing to early non-motor symptoms like hyposmia. The authors also emphasise the potential of targeting cholinergic neurons for early diagnosis and intervention in PD.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This study presents a novel approach, combining multiple mutants to identify salient disease mechanisms. The quality of the data and analysis is of a high standard, providing compelling evidence for the role of OPN neurons in olfactory dysfunction in PD. The authors also provide evidence to show that early olfactory defects lead to later dopaminergic neuron dysfunction. The comprehensive single-cell RNA sequencing data from both flies and humans is a valuable resource for the research community. The identification of consistent impairments in cholinergic olfactory neurons, at early disease stages, is a powerful finding that highlights the convergent nature of PD progression. The comparison between fly models and human patients' brains provides strong evidence of the conservation of molecular mechanisms of disease, which can be built upon in further studies using flies to prove causal relationships between the defects described here and neurodegeneration.</p>
<p>The identification of specific neurons involved in olfactory dysfunction opens up potential avenues for diagnostic and therapeutic interventions.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p>
<p>We thank the reviewers for their comments and provide answers /clarifications and new data; There were 3 important recurrent points we already address here:</p>
<p>(a) The reviewers were concerned that the observed motor defects (measured by startle induced negative geotaxis- “SING”) where a reasonable behavioral measure of DAN function.</p>
<p>Previously, Riemensperger et al., 2013 (PMID: 24239353) already linked synaptic loss of the dopaminergic PAM neurons to SING impairments. Furthermore, in a separate paper that we recently posted on BioRxiv, we show that the SING defects in PD mutants are rescued when the flies are fed L-DOPA (Kaempf et al 2024; BioRxiv). In this same paper we also show a very strong correlation between SING defects and defects in dopaminergic synaptic innervation of PAM DAN onto Mushroom body neurons. Both experiments suggest that the motor defects are the result of defects in dopamine release. Altogether, these data suggest that the combination of the SING assay and a quantification of the synaptic region of PAM DAN onto Mushroom body neurons is a suitable measure for DAN function.</p>
<p>(b) The reviewers asked if the OPN dysfunction in young animals is connected to dopaminergic neuron (DAN) dysfunction in later life;</p>
<p>We have conducted additional experiments and have included the results (new Figure 6): Our young PD mutants (we included Aux<sup>R927G</sup>, Synj<sup>R258Q</sup> and LRRK2<sup>G2019S</sup>) show olfactory defects, but normal DAN function (measured by assessing the TH-labeled synaptic area onto the Mushroom body neurons and by SING). Aged PD mutants show both olfactory defects and DAN dysfunction. When we express the wildtype PD gene in (a.o.) OPN of PD mutants using the GH146-Gal4 (that does not drive expression in DAN) we are able to rescue the DAN defects (synaptic area and SING) that occur later in life. This indeed suggests there is a cell non-autonomous positive effect on DAN dysfunction that occurs at later stages in the life of our PD mutants (new Figure 6a).</p>
<p>In a set of independent experiments, we also fed one of our mutants (LRRK2<sup>G2019S</sup>) nicotine, activating Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (that are also activated by the release of acetylcholine from cholinergic neurons such as OPN). While nicotine does not rescue the olfactory preference defect, the OPN synapse morphology defect or the OPN-associated defects in Ca<sup>2+</sup>-imaging in LRRK2<sup>G2019S</sup> mutants (Figure 6b), it does rescue the DAN-associated defects, including SING, synapse loss and defects in Ca<sup>2+</sup>-imaging (Figure 6c).</p>
<p>Finally, we generated human induced dopaminergic neurons derived from iPSC with a LRRK2<sup>G2019S</sup> mutation and incubated these neurons with nicotine. Again, this induced a rescue of a LRRK2-mutant-induced defect in neuronal activity measured by Ca<sup>2+</sup>-imaging. This is specific to nicotine since the rescue was absent when cells were also incubated with mecamylamine, a non-competitive antagonist of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, trumping the effects of nicotine (Figure 6d-e&quot;).</p>
<p>(c) The reviewers indicated that the GH146 Gal 4 driver is expressed in other cells than OPN and thus, they noted that the defects we observe may not only be the result of OPN dysfunction.</p>
<p>It is correct that GH146-dependent Gal expression includes OPNs (that are cholinergic) and one pair of inhibitory APL neurons (that are GABAergic) (Li et al., 2017 (PMID: 29149607), Lui et al., 2009 (PMID: 19043409)). We have adapted the text to explicitly state this. There are only 2 APL per fly brain and our single cell sequencing experiment does not have the resolution to allow us to test if these neurons had a significant number of DEG. However, as indicated above (in (b)), we are able to rescue DAN dysfunction by mimicking cholinergic output (application of nicotine). These data do not exclude that APL-neuron problems contribute to the defects we observe in our PD mutants, but they do suggest that cholinergic output is critical to maintain normal DAN function.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>This is a fantastic, comprehensive, timely, and landmark pan-species work that demonstrates the convergence of multiple familial PD mutations onto a synaptic program. It is extremely well written and I have only a few comments that do not require additional data collection.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for this enthusiastic endorsement.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Major Comments:</p>
<p>neurons and the olfactory system are acutely impacted by these PD mutations. However, I wonder if this is the case:</p>
<p>(1) In the functional experiments performing calcium imaging on projection neurons I could not find a count of cell bodies across conditions. Since the loss of OPNs could explain the reduced calcium signal, this is a critical control to perform. A differential abundance test on the single-cell data would also suffice here and be easy for the authors to perform with their existing data.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This is indeed an important number, and we had included this in the Supplemental figure 2a.</p>
<p>Also, the number of DAN and Visual projection neurons were not significantly different between the genotypes (Supplemental Figure 2a in the manuscript).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) One of the authors' conclusions is that cholinergic</p>
<p>a. Most Drosophila excitatory neurons are cholinergic</p>
<p>and only a subpopulation appear to be dysregulated by these mutations. The authors point out that visual neurons also have many DEGs, couldn't the visual system also be dysregulated in these flies? Is there something special about these cholinergic neurons versus other cholinergic neurons in the fly brain? I wonder if they can leverage their nice dataset to say something about vulnerability.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Yes, the reviewer is right, and we have changed our wording to be more specific. The reviewer also noted correctly that neurons in the visual system rank high in terms of number of DEGs, but we did not conduct elaborate experiments to assess if these visual system neurons are functional. Of note, several of our mutants show (subtle) electroretinogram defects, that are a measure of visual system integrity, but further work is needed to determine the origin of these defects.</p>
<p>The question about the nature of the underlying vulnerability pathways is interesting. In preliminary work we have selected a number of DEGs common to vulnerable cells in several PD mutants, and conducted a screen where we manipulated the expression of these DEGs and looked for rescue of the olfactory preference defects in our PD mutants. The strongest genetic interaction was with genes encoding proteins involved in proteostasis (Atg8/LC3, Lamp1 and Hsc70-4) (Reviewer Figure 3). While interesting, these results require further work to understand the underlying molecular mechanisms. We present these preliminary data here but have not included them in the main manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>b. As far as I can tell, the cross-species analysis of DEGs (Figure 3) is agnostic to neuronal cell type, although the conclusion seems to suggest only cholinergic neurons were contrasted. Is this correct? Could you please clarify this in the text as it's an important detail. If not, Have the authors tried comparing only cholinergic neuron DEGs across species? That would lend strength to their specificity argument. The results for the NBM are impressive. Could the authors add more detail to the main text here about other regions to the main text?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The reviewer is correct that we compiled the DEG of all affected cells, the majority of which are cholinergic neurons.</p>
<p>For the human data we focused on the NBM samples, because it contained the highest fraction of cholinergic neurons (as compared to the other 2 regions), but even so, it was not possible to analyze the cholinergic neurons alone because the fraction of cholinergic neurons in the human material was too low to be statistically analyzed independently. Note that both wildtype and PD samples contained a low number of cholinergic neurons (i.e. the DEG differences we detected were not the result of sequencing different types of cells - see also Supplemental Figure 3b and d). We have indicated this more clearly in the text.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>c. Uniquely within the human data, are cholinergic neurons more dysregulated than others? I understand this is not an early timepoint but would still be useful to discuss.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As indicated in the previous point, unfortunately the fraction of cholinergic neurons in the human material was low and we were not able to analyze these cells on their own.</p>

<p>d. In the discussion, the authors say that olfactory neurons are uniquely poised to be dysregulated as they are large and have high activity. Is this really true compared to other circuits? I didn't find the references convincing and I am not sure this has been borne out in electron microscopy reconstructions for anatomy.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree and have toned down this statement.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Pech et al selected 5 Parkinson's disease-causing genes, and generated multiple</p>
<p>Drosophila lines by replacing the Drosophila lrrk, rab39, auxilin (aux), synaptojanin</p>
<p>(synj), and Pink1 genes with wild-type and pathogenic mutant human or Drosophila cDNA sequences. First, the authors performed a panel of assays to characterize the phenotypes of the models mentioned above. Next, by using single-cell RNA-seq and comparing fly data with human postmortem tissue data, the authors identified multiple cell clusters being commonly dysregulated in these models, highlighting the olfactory projection neurons. Next, by using selective expression of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensor GCaMP3 in the OPN, the authors confirmed the synaptic impairment in these models, which was further strengthened by olfactory performance defects.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors overall investigated the functionality of PD-related mutations at endogenous levels and found a very interesting shared pathway through singlecell analysis, more importantly, they performed nice follow-up work using multiple assays.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>While the authors state this is a new collection of five familial PD knock-in models, the Aux<sup>R927G</sup> model has been published and carefully characterized in Jacquemyn et al., 2023. ERG has been performed for Aux R927G in Jacquemyn et al., 2023, but the findings are different from what's shown in Figure 1b and Supplementary Figure 1d, which the authors should try to explain.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We should have explained this better: the ERG assay in Jacquemyn et al., and here, in Pech et al., are different. While the ERGs in our previous publication were recorded under normal endogenous conditions, the flies in our current study were exposed to constant light for 7 days. This is often done to accelerate the degeneration phenotype. We have now indicated this in the text (and also refer to the different experimental set up compared to Jacquemyn et al).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Moreover, according to the authors, the hPINK1control was the expression of human PINK1 with UAS-hPINK1 and nsyb-Gal4 due to technical obstacles. Having PINK1 WT being an overexpression model, makes it difficult to explain PINK1 mutant phenotypes. It will be strengthened if the authors use UAS-hPINK1 and nsyb-Gal4 (or maybe ubiquitous Gal4) to rescue hPink1L347P and hPink1P399L phenotypes.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The UAS-hPink1 was originally created by the Lu lab (Yang et al., 2003, PMID: 12670421) and has been amply used before in Pink1 loss-of-function backgrounds (e.g. in Yang et al., 2006, PMID: 16818890). In our work, the control we refer to was UAS-hPink1 expression (driven by nSyb-gal4) in a Pink1 knock-out background. For unknown reasons we were unable to replace the fly Pink1 with a human pink1 cDNA, we explained this in the methods section and added a remark in the new manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>In addition, although the authors picked these models targeting different biology/ pathways, however, Aux and Synj both act in related steps of Clathrin-mediated endocytosis, with LRRK2 being their accessory regulatory proteins. Therefore, is the data set more favorable in identifying synaptic-related defects?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We picked these particular mutants, as they were the first we created in the context of a much larger collection of “PD flies” (see also Kaempf et al 2024, BioRxiv). We have made adaptations to the text to tone down the statement on the broad selection of mutants.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>GH146-GAL4+ PNs are derived from three neuroblast lineages, producing both cholinergic and GABAergic inhibitory PNs (Li et al, 2017). Therefore, OPN neurons have more than &quot;cholinergic projection neurons&quot;. How do we know from singlecell data that cholinergic neurons were more vulnerable across 5 models?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The reviewer is correct that GH146 drives expression in other cells than OPN and we now clearly state this in the text. We do present additional arguments that substantiate our conclusion that cholinergic neurons are affected: (1) our single cell sequencing identifies the most DEGs in cholinergic neurons. (2) nicotine (a compound activating cholinergic receptors) rescues dopamine-related problems in old PD-mutant flies. (3) Likewise, nicotine also alleviates problems we observed in LRRK2 mutant human induced dopaminergic neurons and this is blocked by mecamylamine, a non-competitive antagonist of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>In Figure 1b, the authors assumed that locomotion defects were caused by dopaminergic neuron dysfunction. However, to better support it, the author should perform rescue experiments using dopaminergic neuron-specific Gal4 drivers. Otherwise, the authors may consider staining DA neurons and performing cell counting. Furthermore, the authors stated in the discussion, that &quot;We now place cholinergic failure firmly ahead of dopaminergic system failure in flies&quot;, which feels rushed and insufficient to draw such a conclusion, especially given no experimental evidence was provided, particularly related to DA neuron dysfunction, in this manuscript.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Previously, Riemensperger et al., 2013 (PMID: 24239353) already linked synaptic loss of the dopaminergic PAM neurons to locomotion impairments (measured by SING). Furthermore, in a separate paper we show that the motor defects (SING) observed in PD mutants are rescued when the flies are fed L-DOPA, but not D-DOPA (Kaempf et al 2024; BioRxiv). In this same paper, we also show a significant correlation between SING defects and defects in dopaminergic synaptic innervation of PAM DAN onto Mushroom body neurons. We have referred to both articles in the revised manuscript.</p>
<p>The statement on cholinergic failure ahead of dopaminergic failure was made in the context of the sequence of events: young flies did not show DAN defects, but they did display olfactory defects. The statement was indeed not meant to imply causality. However, we have now conducted new experiments where we express wild type PD genes using GH146-Gal4 (that does not express in DAN) in the PD mutants and assess dopaminergic-relevant phenotypes later in life (see also new Figure 6 in the manuscript). This shows that GH146Gal4-specific rescue is sufficient to alleviate the DAN-dependent SING defects in old flies. Likewise, as indicated above, application of nicotine is also sufficient to rescue the DAN-associated defects (in PD mutant flies and human induced mutant dopaminergic neurons).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>It is interesting to see that different familial PD mutations converge onto synapses. The authors have suggested that different mechanisms may be involved directly through regulating synaptic functions, or indirectly through mitochondria or transport. It will be improved if the authors extend their analysis on Figure 3, and better utilize their single-cell data to dissect the mechanisms. For example, for all the candidates listed in Figure 3C, are they all altered in the same direction across 5 models?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This is indeed the case: the criteria for &quot;commonly deregulated&quot; included that the DEGs are changed in the same direction across several mutants. We ranked genes according to their mean gene expression across the mutants as compared it to the wildtype control: i.e. only if the DEGs are all up- or all down-regulated they end up on the top or bottom of our list. We added a remark in the revised manuscript. In preliminary work we also selected a number of the DEGs and conducted a screen where we manipulated the expression of these genes looking for rescue of the olfactory preference defects in our PD mutants. The strongest genetic interaction was with genes encoding proteins involved in proteostasis (Atg8/LC3, Lamp1 and Hsc70-4; and we also show a genetic interaction between EndoA and Lrrk in this work and in Matta et al., 2012) (Author response image 1 above). While interesting, these results require further work to understand the underlying molecular mechanisms. We present these preliminary data here, but have not included them in the main manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>While this approach is carefully performed, the authors should state in the discussions the strengths and the caveats of the current strategy. For example, what kind of knowledge have we gained by introducing these mutations at an endogenous locus? Are there any caveats of having scRNAseq at day 5 only but being compared with postmortem human disease tissue?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have included a “strengths and caveats section” in the discussion addressing these points.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This study investigates the cellular and molecular events leading to hyposmia, an early dysfunction in Parkinson's disease (PD), which develops up to 10 years prior to motor symptoms. The authors use five Drosophila knock-in models of familial PD genes (LRRK2, RAB39B, PINK1, DNAJC6 (Aux), and SYNJ1 (Synj)), three expressing human genes and two Drosophila genes with equivalent mutations.</p>
<p>The authors carry out single-cell RNA sequencing of young fly brains and singlenucleus RNA sequencing of human brain samples. The authors found that cholinergic olfactory projection neurons (OPN) were consistently affected across the fly models, showing synaptic dysfunction before the onset of motor deficits, known to be associated with dopaminergic neuron (DAN) dysfunction.</p>
<p>Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed significant transcriptional deregulation of synaptic genes in OPNs across all five fly PD models. This synaptic dysfunction was confirmed by impaired calcium signalling and morphological changes in synaptic OPN terminals. Furthermore, these young PD flies exhibited olfactory behavioural deficits that were rescued by selective expression of wild-type genes in OPNs.</p>
<p>Single-nucleus RNA sequencing of post-mortem brain samples from PD patients with LRRK2 risk mutations revealed similar synaptic gene deregulation in cholinergic neurons, particularly in the nucleus basalis of Meynert (NBM). Gene ontology analysis highlighted enrichment for processes related to presynaptic function, protein homeostasis, RNA regulation, and mitochondrial function.</p>
<p>This study provides compelling evidence for the early and primary involvement of cholinergic dysfunction in PD pathogenesis, preceding the canonical DAN degeneration. The convergence of familial PD mutations on synaptic dysfunction in cholinergic projection neurons suggests a common mechanism contributing to early non-motor symptoms like hyposmia. The authors also emphasise the potential of targeting cholinergic neurons for early diagnosis and intervention in PD.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This study presents a novel approach, combining multiple mutants to identify salient disease mechanisms. The quality of the data and analysis is of a high standard, providing compelling evidence for the role of OPN neurons in olfactory dysfunction in PD. The comprehensive single-cell RNA sequencing data from both flies and humans is a valuable resource for the research community. The identification of consistent impairments in cholinergic olfactory neurons, at early disease stages, is a powerful finding that highlights the convergent nature of PD progression. The comparison between fly models and human patients' brains provides strong evidence of the conservation of molecular mechanisms of disease, which can be built upon in further studies using flies to prove causal relationships between the defects described here and neurodegeneration.</p>
<p>The identification of specific neurons involved in olfactory dysfunction opens up potential avenues for diagnostic and therapeutic interventions.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The causal relationship between early olfactory dysfunction and later motor symptoms in PD remains unclear. It is also uncertain whether this early defect contributes to neurodegeneration or is simply a reflection of the sensitivity of olfactory neurons to cellular impairments. The study does not investigate whether the observed early olfactory impairment in flies leads to later DAN deficits. Additionally, the single-cell RNA sequencing analysis reveals several affected neuronal populations that are not further explored. The main weakness of the paper is the lack of conclusive evidence linking early olfactory dysfunction to later disease progression.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree that this is an interesting avenue to pursue and as indicated above in Figure 6 and in the reworked manuscript, we have now included data that strengthens the connection between early OPN defects and the later DAN dependent problems. Additional future work will be needed to elucidate the mechanisms of this cell-non autonomous effect.</p>

<p>The rationale behind the selection of specific mutants and neuronal populations for further analysis could be better qualified.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>Minor Comments:</p>
<p>(1) Questions about the sequencing methods and analysis approaches. From reading the methods and main text, I was confused about aspects of the Drosophila single-cell profiling. Firstly, did the authors multiplex their fly samples?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>No, we did not. Genotypes were separately prepared and sequenced, but they were all processed in parallel to avoid batch effects.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Secondly, it seems like there are two rounds of dataset integration performed, Harmony and Seurat's CCA-based method. This seems unorthodox. Could the authors comment on why they perform two integrations?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks for pointing this out, this was a mistake in the methods section (copied from a much older version of the manuscript). In this manuscript, we only used harmony for dataset integration and removed the methods on Seurat-CCA.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Finally, for all dataset integrations please state in the main text how datasets were integrated (by age, genotype, etc).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Datasets were integrated by sample id, corresponding to individual libraries.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) The authors focus on OPNs with a really nice set of experiments. I noticed however that Kenyon cells were also dysregulated. What about Olfactory sensory neurons? Could the authors provide comments on this?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Olfactory sensory neurons are located in the antennae of the fly brain and were not captured by our analysis. However, the GH146-Gal4-specific rescue experiments indicate these sensory neurons are likely not severely functionally impaired. Kenyon cells are an interesting affected cell type to look at in future experiments, as they are directly connected to DANs.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) There are several citations of Jenett et al 2012 that seem wrong (related to single-cell datasets).</p>

<p>We are sorry for this and have corrected this in the text.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors)</bold>:</p>
<p>(1) In the key resources table, a line called CG5010k.o. (chchd2k.o.) was mentioned, but was not used in the paper. The authors should remove it.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Sorry, this was from a previous older version of the manuscript. We fixed this.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) Why did the authors use human CDS for LRRK2, Rab39B, and PINK1, but fly CDS for Aux and Synj1? Is it based on the conservation of amino acid residues? Although the authors cited a review (Kalia &amp; Lang, 2015) to justify the selection of the mutations, for the interest of a broad audience, it is recommended that the authors expand their introduction for the rationale of their selection, including the pathogenicity of each selected mutation, original human genetics evidence, conservation between fly and human.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>(a) We used Drosophila cDNA for rescue experiments with aux and synj since knockin of the human homologues at the locus of these genes did not rescue its loss-offunction (lethality).</p>
<p>(b) We expanded the introduction to provide further explanation on the selection of our mutants we analyzed in this work. We picked these particular mutants, as they were the first we created in the context of a much larger collection of “PD flies” (see also Kaempf et al 2024, BioRxiv). We have made adaptations to the text to tone down the statement on the broad selection of mutants.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) Supplemental Figure 1a, is mRNA level normalized to an internal control? If not, it is not appropriate to compare the results directly from two primer sets, since each primer set may have different amplification efficiency.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We are sorry for the lack of information. Indeed, mRNA levels were determined using the Δ-Δ-CT method, where Ct values were first normalized to the housekeeping gene Rp49, and next expressed as a percent of endogenous Drosophila gene expression. We expanded the methods section and now also enlist the primers for Rp49 along with the other qPCR primers in Supplemental File 1.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) For Figure 2, it may be helpful to have a supplemental table or figure showcasing the clusters with significant changes (based on cell number-adjusted DEGs) for each model, i.e., what are those black cell clusters in Figure 2? &quot;Thus, cellular identity and cellular composition are preserved in young PD fly models.&quot; In Figure S2A, the authors only show cell composition percentages for 3 cell clusters, are the bars 95% standard error?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The error bars in Supplemental Figure 2a represent the 95 % CI. We have included a new supplemental table with the number of cells per cell cluster for each mutant (Supplemental File 3).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>What about the remaining 183 cell clusters? Are there any KI-model cell clusters that are statistically different than controls? What about the annotated cell types (e.g., the 81 with cell identities)? Please consider at least providing or pointing to a table to state how many have significant differences, or if there are truly none.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As mentioned above, we have included a new supplemental table with the number of cells per cell cluster for each mutant (Supplemental File 3).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) What are the rows in the sunburst plot in Figure 3a? Please be more descriptive in the figure legend or label the figure.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have expanded on this in the figure legend and now also include a summary of the SynGO analysis in Supplemental File 7. In Figure 3a, a summary sunburst plot is presented, reflecting the GO terms (inner rings, indicated in a) with their subdivided levels (the complete list is provided in Supplemental File 7). In Figure 3a’ and a” the DEG data acquired from the different datasets (human vs fly) are applied to the sunburst plot where rings are color-coded according to enrichment Q-value.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(6) In Table S4, which clusters (in the table) have normalized residuals that are outside of the 95% confidence interval of the regression model displayed in Figure S2e? They use this analysis to adjust for cell number bias and point out the &quot;most significant cell clusters&quot; affected in each model. This may be helpful for readers who want to grab a full list of responsive clusters.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have included this information in Supplemental File 5 (Tab “Cell types outside of CIs”) in the supplemental data of the manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(7) The human samples used all have different LRRK2 variants: for the crossspecies comparisons, do Lrrk flies have greater similarity to the human PD cases compared to the other fly models?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>No, comparing the vulnerable gene signatures from each of the fly mutants to the DEGs from the human samples does not show any greater similarity between the LRRK mutants compared to the other mutants.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>Clarifications required:</p>
<p>Some of the mutations used are not common PD-associated genes, the authors should explain the rationale behind using these particular mutants, and not using well-established fly models of PD (like for example GBA flies) or SNCA overexpression.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We opted to use knock-ins of mutations that are causal to Parkinsonism. Given flies do not express an alpha-synuclein homologue we were not able to add this ‘as such’ to our collection. Future work can indeed also include expression models or risk factor models (like GBA). As also requested by another reviewer, we did add further rationale and explanation to the genes we chose to analyze in this work.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Why starvation rather than lifespan for PD models? For the lifespan data shown there are no error bars, if the stats test is a log-rank or Cox proportional hazards (usually used in survival analysis, this should be stated), it would also be good to have the survival plots for all the survival during starvation, not just PINK1.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>While starvation assays can provide valuable insights into acute metabolic and physiological stress responses, we acknowledge that lifespan is a critical parameter and would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the PD models in our study. Based on this consideration and the reviewer’s feedback we have removed the starvation data from the manuscript. Unfortunately, we did not perform lifespan experiments, which is why these data were not included in the manuscript. However, based on our observations (though not detailed analysis), all genotypes tested—except for the PINK1 mutants—appeared to have a normal lifespan. For PINK1 mutants, most flies died by 25 days of age. Therefore, we conducted our assays using 15-day-old PINK1 mutant flies.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Do the fly models used have different lifespans, and how close to death was the SING assay performed? Different mutations show different effects, most phenotypes are really mild (hRab39BG192R has no phenotype), and PINK1 has the strongest, are these simply reflections of how strong the model is?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The ages of flies we analyzed are indicated in the legend. As mentioned before, all but PINK1 mutants- had a normal life span: i.e. we did not detect abnormal low number of flies or premature death at 50 days of age, except for the PINK1 mutants tested in this manuscript where most flies died by 25 days of age. Therefore, we conducted our assays using 15-day-old PINK1 mutant flies.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Rab39G192R has no phenotype in the tests presented, suggesting no degeneration, why use RabG192R for scRNA seq? Seems an odd choice, the authors should explain.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Single-cell sequencing was initiated before the full phenotypic characterization of all mutants was completed. Although basic characterization of the Rab39<sup>G192R</sup> mutant PD flies revealed either no significant phenotypes or only mild effects in the assays performed (Figure 1), the sequencing data provided additional insights into potential cellular and molecular alterations. Furthermore, all PD-mutant knock-ins, including Rab39<sup>G192R</sup> mutant PD flies, show dysfunctional synaptic terminals of their OPN neurons as they had significantly weaker Ca<sup>2+</sup>-responses, even though their synaptic area was increased (Figure 4 g-h). Furthermore, all mutants also had olfactory behavior defects (Figure 5 a).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>When the authors state that “For example, in the NBM, an area associated with PD (Arendt et al., 1983), 20% of the DEG that has an orthologous gene in the fly are also found among the most deregulated genes across PD fly models&quot; a test should be performed to confirm this is a significant overlap (such as a hypergeometric test).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have performed this test, of the 2486 significantly differential human genes, 1149 have a fly orthologue, and of these, 28.46 % overlap with the deregulated fly genes (5 % top and bottom gene as shown in Supplemental Table 7). Performing a hypergeometric test confirms that this overlap is significant, with a p-value of 9.06e<sup>76</sup>. We have included this in the text.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The authors speak of deregulation when speaking of the overlap between human and fly DE genes, but do the over-expressed genes in flies overlap with overexpressed genes in humans, or is the direction of transcription deregulation not concordant? If it is mostly not concordant, can the authors please comment as to why they might think that is the case?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In our fly experiments, we identified DEG in affected cell types and then defined common DEG by looking at the average change across the fly mutants. Genes that show a consistent change (all or mostly up, or all or mostly down) in the different mutants will end at the top of our list while genes that are up in some mutants and downregulated in others will average out and not end up in our commonly deregulated gene list. For comparison to the human data, we only looked for the presence of the human homologue, but did not assess if the change occurred in the same direction. More work will be needed to define the most relevant changes, but in a mini-screen we did select a number of DEG present in fly and human datasets from different functional categories and tested if they genetically interact with our PD mutants. As shown in Reviewer Figure 3, we find that modulating proteostasis pathway-encoding genes rescue the olfactory preference defect across many PD mutants.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Can the authors explain why only the NMB region was used for comparison with the fly data?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We used the NMB because this region has the highest number of cholinergic neurons to compare the deregulation in those neurons to the deregulation in the cholinergic OPN of mutant PD flies.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>In Figure 4, can the genotypes please be stated in full and why is the hPINK1 fly giving no detectable signal?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Despite several attempts, we failed to knock-in wild type hPink1 in the fly pink1 locus. Therefore, the hPink1 control used throughout the manuscript was the nSybGal4&gt;UAS-hPink1 in Pink1 knock-out background, except for Figure 4. Particularly, for experiments in this figure, we could not use UAS-hPink1 with nSyb-Gal4, since we needed OPN-specific expression of Gal4 to drive UAS-GCamP expression.</p>
<p>Therefore, this was labeled as “not determined” (“n.d.”), as indicated in the figure and the legend. We explained this better in the methods section, added a remark in the new manuscript and expanded the legend of Figure 4.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The paper states that&quot; These findings imply that factors affecting the function of cholinergic neurons might, by the absence of insufficient innervation, lead to DAN problems and degeneration, warranting further exploration of the underlying molecular mechanisms&quot;, this should be less strong, the paper never looks at DAN, only at OPN neurons. Fly neurons are mostly cholinergic, and human neurons are mostly glutamatergic, so jumping from one system to the other might not be as straightforward, the authors should comment on this.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We now included a new exciting experiment where we assessed DAN function in aged PD mutants where the wildtype gene was expressed in OPN using GH146-Gal4. We find this manipulation rescued DAN defects (measured by SING) in older flies. We further corroborated our observation by “replacing” cholinergic innervation with nicotine feeding in PD mutants. Also, this rescues the SING defect as well as the defects in neuronal activity in PAM DAN (based on live synaptic calcium imaging). Finally, we also show that incubating LRRK2<sup>G2019S</sup> mutant human induced dopaminergic neurons with nicotine is sufficient to rescue functional defects in these neurons (measured using calcium imaging). We included this data in the new manuscript and show them also in Figure 6 above (new Figure 6 in the revised manuscript).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Experiments that would improve the manuscript:</p>
<p>Does rescue of OPN function also rescue later progressive symptoms (geotaxis response)?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>It does, as indicated in the previous point and shown in Figure 6.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Do the fly PD models used show DAN degeneration? This could be assessed by stains with anti-TH stains.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We quantified DAN cell bodies using anti-TH, but see very little or no loss. There is, however, loss of synaptic innervation of the PAM onto the mushroom bodies. We included the data in a new Figure 6 (see also Figure 6). Furthermore, we have quantified this across the genetic space of familial Parkinsonism in Kaempf et al., 2024, BioRxiv. Note that this phenotype is also rescued by expressing wildtype CDS in their OPN using GH146-Gal4.</p>

<p>Stating &quot;fifth row&quot; in Fig 5c and d is confusing, can the figure be labelled more clearly?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We modified the figure (including extra marks and colors) and expanded the legend and the main text to differentiate better between expression of the rescues in OPN versus T1 neurons revealing that only expression in OPN neurons rescues the olfactory defects while expression in T1 neurons does not.</p>
