<title>Abstract</title><p>Sterol lipids are widely present in eukaryotes and play essential roles in signaling and modulating membrane fluidity. Although rare, some bacteria also produce sterols, but their function in bacteria is not known. Moreover, many more species, including pathogens and commensal microbes, acquire or modify sterols from eukaryotic hosts through poorly understood molecular mechanisms. The aerobic methanotroph <italic>Methylococcus capsulatus</italic> was the first bacterium shown to synthesize sterols, producing a mixture of C-4 methylated sterols that are distinct from those observed in eukaryotes. C-4 methylated sterols are synthesized in the cytosol and localized to the outer membrane, suggesting that a bacterial sterol transport machinery exists. Until now, the identity of such machinery remained a mystery. In this study, we identified three novel proteins that may be the first examples of transporters for bacterial sterol lipids. The proteins, which all belong to well-studied families of bacterial metabolite transporters, are predicted to reside in the inner membrane, periplasm, and outer membrane of <italic>M. capsulatus,</italic> and may work as a conduit to move modified sterols to the outer membrane. Quantitative analysis of ligand binding revealed their remarkable specificity for 4-methylsterols, and crystallographic structures coupled with docking and molecular dynamics simulations revealed the structural bases for substrate binding by two of the putative transporters. Their striking structural divergence from eukaryotic sterol transporters signals that they form a distinct sterol transport system within the bacterial domain. Finally, bioinformatics revealed the widespread presence of similar transporters in bacterial genomes, including in some pathogens that use host sterol lipids to construct their cell envelopes. The unique folds of these bacterial sterol binding proteins should now guide the discovery of other proteins that handle this essential metabolite.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Sterol lipids are ubiquitous and essential components of eukaryotic life, playing vital roles in intra- and intercellular signaling, stress tolerance, and maintaining cell membrane integrity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Bi and Liao, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Bloch, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Huang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Miao et al., 2002</xref>). Although sterol synthesis is often considered to be a strictly eukaryotic feature, several bacteria have been shown to also produce sterols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Bloch, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Ourisson et al., 1987</xref>). Bacterial sterols were first discovered in <italic>Methylococcus capsulatus</italic> more than 40 years ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">BIRD et al., 1971</xref>) and initially, were only observed in a few isolated aerobic methanotrophs (ψ-Proteobacteria) and a few myxobacteria (δ-Proteobacteria) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Bode et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Kohl et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Patt and Hanson, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Schouten et al., 2000</xref>). Subsequent comparative genomics analyses have revealed the potential to produce sterol in a variety of bacterial groups including Planctomycetes, α-Proteobacteria, and Bacteroidetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Bode et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Pearson et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Wei et al., 2016</xref>). Sterols produced by bacteria, however, tend to differ from eukaryotic sterols in both structure and in their biosynthetic pathways.</p>
<p>Sterol synthesis in both bacteria and eukaryotes requires the cyclization of the linear substrate oxidosqualene by an oxidosqualene cyclase (Osc) to generate either lanosterol or cycloartenol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Abe, 2014</xref>). However, fungi, vertebrates, and plants further modify these initial cyclization products to synthesize ergosterol, cholesterol, and stigmasterol, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Desmond and Gribaldo, 2009</xref>). These biochemical transformations include demethylations, isomerizations, saturations, and desaturations that are essential for sterols to function properly in eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Nes et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Xu et al., 2005</xref>). Although bacterial production of fully modified sterols such as cholesterol is rare (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Lee et al., 2023</xref>), some bacteria, including several aerobic methanotrophs and myxobacteria, do modify their sterols. For example, <italic>M. capsulatus</italic> produces sterols that are demethylated once at the C-4 and C-14 positions and contain a unique desaturation between C-8 and C-14 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Bouvier et al., 1976</xref>) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.1A</xref>). In addition, studies have revealed that bacterial proteins required to modify sterols can differ from the canonical eukaryotic sterol modifying proteins. Examples are the recently identified sterol demethylase proteins, SdmA and SdmB, in <italic>M. capsulatus</italic> that use O<sub>2</sub> to remove one methyl group at the C-4 position; the enzymes are mechanistically distinct from the eukaryotic C-4 demethylase enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Gachotte et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Lee et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Rahier, 2011</xref>).</p>

<p>Although we have a better grasp of the taxonomic distribution of sterol synthesis in bacteria and of the distinct bacterial proteins involved in their biosynthesis, the function of these lipids in bacteria remains a mystery. It has been posited that bacterial sterols play a role in modulating the fluidic properties of the cytoplasmic membrane, similar to what is observed for cholesterol and ergosterol in eukaryotic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Miao et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Parks et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Summons et al., 2006</xref>). However, studies in <italic>M. capsulatus</italic> have demonstrated that the distribution of sterols differs considerably from what occurs in eukaryotes. Approximately 90% of the free sterol pool in eukaryotic cells is found in the cytoplasmic membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Jacquier and Schneiter, 2012</xref>) while in <italic>M. capsulatus</italic>, 75% of sterols are localized to the outer membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">JAHNKE et al., 1992</xref>). The outer membrane is the external asymmetric membrane of Gram-negative bacteria and differs from the cytoplasmic membrane in that its outer leaflet is composed of lipopolysaccharides (LPS) in addition to phospholipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Ruiz et al., 2006</xref>). Additionally, sterols that differ by only a single methylation in the core structure can produce significantly different effects in terms of membrane fluidity and stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bacia et al., 2005</xref>). Given that <italic>M. capsulatus</italic> primarily produces sterols with one or two C-4 methyl groups, any sterol-membrane interactions in <italic>M. capsulatus</italic> could differ significantly from what is observed in eukaryotic membranes with cholesterol and ergosterol, which lack methyl groups at the C-4 position.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the 4,4-dimethyl sterols and 4-monomethyl sterols found in <italic>M. capsulatus</italic> also exist as precursors of pathway end-products in eukaryotes and accumulation of C-4 methylated sterols has been associated with a variety of eukaryotic processes. The accumulation of C-4 methylated intermediates is considered to be the cause of human genetic diseases known as sterolosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">He et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">König et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">McLarren et al., 2010</xref>) and 4,4-dimethyl sterols such as lanosterol in the brain are implicated in Parkinson’s disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Lim et al., 2012</xref>). In a variety of yeast species, C-4 methylated intermediates can regulate cellular processes associated with hypoxia and other conditions of cellular stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Hughes et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Serratore et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Todd et al., 2006</xref>). Although the function of 4,4-dimethyl sterols and 4-monomethyl sterols in bacteria is still elusive, a functional role for these specific sterols beyond maintaining membrane fluidity and integrity seems plausible.</p>
<p>To better understand the significance of sterol utilization in the bacterial domain, a fuller understanding of the molecular mechanisms controlling sterol production and localization is needed. Given the observed distribution of sterols in the outer membrane of <italic>M. capsulatus</italic>, we hypothesized that transporters specific for C-4 methylated sterols must exist that can shuttle these substrates to the outer membrane. Trafficking of sterols to various organelles in eukaryotic cells is not fully understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Jacquier and Schneiter, 2012</xref>) and impaired sterol transport is related to a variety of defects including lysosomal storage diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Vance and Peake, 2011</xref>). Identifying and characterizing bacterial proteins that transport sterol could reveal novel sterol binding motifs and folds and will provide meaningful insights into protein-sterol interactions and lipid trafficking more broadly.</p>
<p>In this study, we present three putative bacterial sterol transport proteins in <italic>M. capsulatus</italic> that exhibit remarkable specificity for C-4 methylated sterols. We first used bioinformatics to identify a cytoplasmic membrane protein (BstA), periplasmic protein (BstB), and outer membrane associated protein (BstC). Their ability to recognize and bind sterols was confirmed using protein-lipid pull down assays, where they showed selective binding to C-4 methylated sterols when in the presence of total lipid extracts from <italic>M. capsulatus.</italic> Quantitative assessment of ligand binding using Microscale Thermophoresis (MST) confirmed their preference for 4-monomethyl sterol, which they bind with equilibrium dissociation constants that are 30-90-fold lower than the 4,4-dimethyl sterol. High-resolution crystallographic structures of BstB and BstC reveal their pronounced divergence from eukaryotic sterol transporters. Docking studies and molecular dynamics simulations with sterol substrates reveal putative substrate binding sites and recognition mechanisms. Collectively, these data provide evidence for a novel sterol transport system within the bacterial domain and advances our understanding of bacterial sterol lipids.</p>

<sec id="s2a">
<title>Bioinformatic identification of sterol transport proteins in <italic>M. capsulatus</italic></title>
<p>In a previous study, we used the Joint Genome Institute (JGI) Integrated Microbial Genomes (IMG) Phylogenetic Profiler to identify seventeen candidate genes in <italic>M. capsulatus</italic> that are unique to C-4 demethylating methanotrophs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Lee et al., 2018</xref>). Among them, a putative operon that contains five genes was found to localize next to three sterol biosynthesis genes. Two (<italic>sdmA/sdmB</italic>) have been characterized as demethylases involved in sterol demethylation at the C-4 position. Homologs of the other three hypothetical genes we have named <italic>bstA, bstB</italic> and <italic>bstC</italic> (<underline>b</underline>acterial <underline>s</underline>terol transporter), are found in all other aerobic methanotroph genomes that contain <italic>sdmA/sdmB</italic>. In some of these species, these three genes are also seen to be adjacent to other sterol synthesis genes such as the oxidosqualene cyclase (<italic>osc</italic>) and squalene monooxygenase (<italic>smo</italic>), implying they may be functionally related to sterol physiology (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>)</p>
<p>To obtain additional insights into the proteins encoded by these genes, we performed more refined bioinformatic analyses including protein sequence similarity network (SSN) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Atkinson et al., 2009</xref>) and structure prediction with Phyre2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Kelley et al., 2015</xref>) and I-TASSER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Yang et al., 2015</xref>). BstA is predicted to belong to the Resistance Nodulation Division (RND) superfamily of transporters, which comprises inner membrane proteins that facilitate drug and heavy metal efflux, and protein secretion, amongst others. They are widespread in gram negative bacteria, but homologs are also found in archaea and eukaryotes. Interestingly, the human Newman Pick Type C1, a transporter of sterols, also contains a transmembrane RND domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Nikaido, 2018</xref>). The SSN of this superfamily shows that BstA is grouped into a single cluster containing 5 nodes (where sequences with &gt;50% identity are merged into a single node). Structural prediction shows BstA shares a high homology with a membrane-bound hopanoid transporter, HpnN (PDB 5KHS, <italic>Burkholderia multivorans</italic>), a RND transporter that moves hopanoids from the cytoplasm or cytoplasmic membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Doughty et al., 2011</xref>). In the SSN, HpnN is clustered separate from BstA, suggesting a possible functional divergence (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1A</xref>, <xref rid="tbls2" ref-type="table">Table S2</xref>).</p>
<p>BstB belongs to a family of periplasmic/substrate binding proteins (SBPs/PBPs) known to traffic bacterial metabolites such as phosphonate. BstB proteins are grouped into a single cluster consisting of 16 sequences, with most of the sequences belonging to the <italic>Methylococcaceae</italic> family. Notably, the BstB proteins cluster separately even under stringent cutoffs of sequence identity (as low as 20%), hinting at an astounding distinction of function compared with homologs (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1B</xref>, <xref rid="tbls2" ref-type="table">Table S2</xref>). Structure prediction of BstB shows homology to PhnD (PDB 3QK6), a periplasmic solute-binding protein of the phosphonate uptake system in <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Alicea et al., 2011</xref>). All structurally characterized PhnD homologs are distributed into different clusters in the SSN.</p>
<p>Finally, BstC is predicted to be a T-component of the tripartite ATP-independent periplasmic component superfamily, which comprises periplasmic lipoproteins implicated in the cytoplasmic import of small molecules. The SSN of BstC reveals that the protein and its closest homologs are also grouped into a separate cluster even under a sequence identity cutoff of 20%. The cluster consists of 13 sequences, with most from <italic>Methylococcaceae</italic> and <italic>Deltaproteobacteria</italic> families. At the time of analysis, only one protein in the entire superfamily had structural or biochemical information: Tp0956 from <italic>Treponema pallidum</italic> (PDB 3U64) is found in the second largest cluster of the network (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1C</xref>, <xref rid="tbls2" ref-type="table">Table S2</xref>). Compared with the SSNs of BstA and BstB, that of BstC shows the family is predominantly bacterial, with only 1 and 5 sequences from eukaryotes and archaea, respectively (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1A-C</xref>).</p>
<p>In summary, sequence and predicted structural homology analyses reveal BstA, BstB, and BstC to be highly similar to transporters involved in disparate bacterial transport systems. However, their separation into distinct clusters in the SSNs imply their functions, including potential substrates, are not identical to their homologs. Because the Bst genes always co-localize with sterol synthesis genes (<italic>osc, sdmA</italic> and <italic>sdmB</italic>) in methanotrophs that produce sterols, we hypothesize that BstA/BstB/BstC represent a novel transport system for sterols in bacteria (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref> and <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1D</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2b">
<title>Sterol interaction with transporters</title>
<p>To determine whether BstA, BstB, and BstC are sterol transporters, we first attempted gene deletion in <italic>M. capsulatus</italic>. The deletion of these genes, along with others that are required for sterol synthesis (e.g., <italic>osc</italic>) were not successful, hinting that sterol synthesis and proper localization might be essential in this organism. Because these proteins share homology with well-known bacterial transporters, we reasoned that they are transporters and focused on determining their substrate preference by conducting pull-down assays to assess the binding of sterols from <italic>M. capsulatus</italic> lipid extracts. In these studies, an excess of recombinantly produced pure proteins was incubated with either the total lipid extract (TLE) from <italic>M. capsulatus</italic> or a specific polar fraction enriched for native hydroxy-lipids/sterols (HS). Using the HisPur Ni-NTA resin, proteins were isolated, and the bound lipids were extracted and identified by GC-MS. In the presence of TLE and HS, BstA<sup>PD</sup> (the periplasmic domain of BstA; details in method), BstB, and BstC bound to 4-monomethyl and 4,4-dimethyl sterols (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>, <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2</xref>). In contrast, neither the 4-monomethyl sterol, the 4,4-dimethyl sterol, nor any other lipids were present when the proteins were incubated with the DMSO negative control, suggesting that the recombinantly produced proteins did not co-purify with any lipids. These results indicate that BstA<sup>PD</sup>, BstB, and BstC preferentially bind C-4 methylated sterols in a mixture of native <italic>M. capsulatus</italic> sterols, hopanoids, and fatty acids.</p>

<title>Quantitative analyses of protein-sterol interactions</title>
<p>The data from the pull-down assays demonstrated that C-4 methylated sterols have affinity for these putative sterol transporters. We next used microscale thermophoresis (MST) to determine the equilibrium binding affinities for these substrates. Binding curves were generated upon titration of the labeled proteins with serially diluted sterol substrates, and the equilibrium dissociation constants were calculated by fitting the curves with different kinetic models (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>, methods). The “<italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub>” model applies to binding events with a single binding site or multiple independent binding sites, while the Hill model is invoked in instances where multiple binding sites that exhibit cooperativity are present, with Hill coefficients (n<sub>H</sub>) greater than 1 signaling positive cooperativity. The average equilibrium dissociation (<italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub>) constant for BstA<sup>PD</sup> binding to 4-monomethyl sterol was determined to be 4.41±0.14 μM (n<sub>H</sub>=4.0) and ≥203±155 μM for the interaction with 4,4-dimethyl sterol. For BstB, the <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> value of 2.43±0.13 μM (n<sub>H</sub> of 2.4) was determined for 4-monomethyl sterol; and ≥232±84.3 μM for 4,4-dimethyl sterol. With BstC, the determined values were 2.50±0.39 μM and ≥80.9±14.2 μM for 4-monomethyl sterol and 4,4-dimethyl sterol, respectively. All <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> values for the 4,4-dimethyl sterol could not be accurately determined due to large errors caused by non-saturation even at the highest substrate concentration. In all three proteins, we measured clear binding to C-4 methylated sterols, with marked preference for the 4-monomethyl substrate. Additionally, BstA<sup>PD</sup> and BstB exhibit cooperativity for binding to 4-monomethyl substrate, indicating that multiple binding sites are plausible.</p>
<p>To further define the specificity of Bst proteins for sterols, we again used MST to detect their interactions with cholesterol and lanosterol, a lipid and precursor that differ in their methylation at the C-4 and C-14 positions, as well as their unsaturation patterns in the core ring structure. The MST results revealed no interaction between BstA<sup>PD</sup> and BstB with either cholesterol or lanosterol. However, BstC did bind to cholesterol with a <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> value of 3.6±0.64 μM and to lanosterol with a value of 17.3±3.92 μM (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3</xref>). These data hint that BstC is more tolerant to non-native substates.</p>

<title>Crystallographic structure of BstB</title>
<p>To understand the molecular details that govern sterol recognition and binding, we crystallized BstB and obtained crystals of the apo form (<xref rid="tbls1" ref-type="table">Table S1</xref>). The 1.6 Å-resolution structure of was determined by experimental phasing, producing electron density that allowed the unambiguous building of a model of BstB (except for one disordered loop spanning residues 202-204). The structure comprises two globular α/β domains (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>, domains A and B) that form a cleft at the middle. Domain A contains six β-strands while domain B contains five. All the β-strands are flanked by α-helices. The domains are connected by two loops: one 9-residue loop that runs from β4 in domain A to β5 in domain B, and a second 8-residue loop that connects β9 in domain B and β10 in domain A. These two long loops could work as a hinge to allow a bending motion of two domains to induce a conformational change upon substrate binding that is often observed with SBPs/PBPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Boer et al., 2019</xref>). In addition, an α-helix formed by the C-terminal residues lies behind the cleft and may also allow flexibility of the two domains. Several extend loops are found on the domain-domain interface. The loops (residues 34-38 and residues 171-177) exhibit poor electron densities, suggesting conformational sampling of more than one state (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Fig. S4A</xref>).</p>

<p>The cleft between domains A and B forms a bulky cavity with an area of ∼ 1179.5 Å<sup>2</sup> and a volume of ∼ 1009.6 Å<sup>3</sup> that extends into domain A and is only accessible to solvent from one side of the structure. The cavity is predominantly hydrophobic, suggesting large and hydrophobic substrates like sterols are favorable for binding (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>, <xref rid="tbls4" ref-type="table">Table S4</xref>). Additionally, a second pocket (area of ∼172 Å<sup>2</sup>; volume of ∼117 Å<sup>3</sup>) is found in domain B and close to the central cleft. This pocket is localized behind the unmodeled loop (residues 202-204), with the extremely poor density in this part implying high flexibility. The high level of hydrophobicity in this pocket suggests it could be an additional binding site for the sterol substrate (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>; Fig.S5), in support of the binding data that suggests cooperativity between multiple substrate binding sites. Other separate hydrophobic areas are also observed on the protein surface and a new hydrophobic interface could be formed by two hydrophobic areas across the cleft upon conformational change induced by substrate binding (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Fig. S5</xref>). These areas may be helpful for mediating the protein-protein interactions with BstA or BstC to facilitate the substrate transfer.</p>
<p>A DALI structural homology search (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Holm and Rosenström, 2010</xref>) suggests the structure of BstB closely resembles that of PBPs that share a bi-lobe architecture and undergo conformational change upon substrate binding to the central cavity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Quiocho and Ledvina, 1996</xref>). A comparison of the BstB structure with the phosphonate-binding protein PhnD from <italic>E. coli</italic> with and without its substrate (2-aminoethyl phosphonate, 2AEP, PDB 3P7I and 3S4U) was performed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Alicea et al., 2011</xref>). The comparison revealed that BstB adopts an intermediate conformation between the unliganded PhnD (3S4U) and liganded one (3P7I, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>). The cleft in BstB is less open (∼10 Å) than that in apo-PhnD (∼22 Å). There are two possible explanations for this: 1) compared with apo-PhnD structure, the cleft of BstB is deeper and more hydrophobic. Given that BstB binds to sterols (which have a nearly planar architecture and are more hydrophobic than phosphonates), the different architecture of the cleft in BstB may be related to its functional role; 2) it is known that binding of non-substrate ligands can at times trigger a conformational change in PBPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Boer et al., 2019</xref>). Although no obvious ligand density is observed in the BstB structure, weak unmodeled densities were observed inside the central cavity. Most of these are small patches that cannot be satisfactorily modeled with water and do not closely correspond to any reagent used for crystallization. One of these patches in the central cleft could be modeled with a chloride ion engaging in polar interactions with the surrounding Glu118, Tyr120 and Phe150. Additionally, more unmodeled positive density is observed in further into the cavity in domain A (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Fig. S4B-C</xref>). It is plausible that the binding of ligands co-purified with the protein triggered a conformational change leading to a “partially-open” state.</p>

<title>Substrate docking and molecular dynamics simulation of BstB</title>
<p>To obtain greater insights into the mechanism of substrate recognition and binding in the absence of a substrate-bound structure, we used ICM-Pro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Abagyan et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Abagyan and Totrov, 1994</xref>) to generate docking models of C-4 methylated sterol binding to BstB. A three-dimensional model of 4α-monomethyl sterol was constructed from the structure of cholesterol using the Molecular Editor in ICM-Pro and then docked to the BstB structure. In the first iteration, the protein was held rigid, and the ligand allowed to dock flexibly. In this docking model, the sterol was positioned in the hydrophobic cavity in domain A with the polar head pointing toward the central cleft and domain B, adjacent to three residues: Glu118, Tyr120 and Asn192. In subsequent replicate docking iterations, the side chains of these three residues were allowed to be flexible along with the ligand. There are three energetically favored poses: two (<italic>Mono</italic><sub>A</sub> and <italic>Mono</italic><sub>B</sub>) form a single hydrogen bond to Tyr120, while pose <italic>Mono</italic><sub>C</sub> where the hydroxyl makes two hydrogen bonds to Tyr120 and Asn192 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref> and <xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Figs. S6A-C</xref>, <xref rid="tbls3" ref-type="table">Table S3</xref>).</p>
<p>To probe the dynamics of the BstB structure during substrate binding, we performed multiple 20 ns molecular dynamics (MD) simulations using Desmond (Schrodinger) on each docked poses for monomethyl sterol from ICM-Pro. In all cases, analysis of the resultant MD trajectories indicated that the simulations became stable after the first few picoseconds. In the three poses where there was initially an interaction with Tyr120, that interaction is lost and replaced with a new hydrogen bond with Glu118, which persists for 85%-95% of the simulation. Pose <italic>Mono</italic><sub>C</sub> also has an intermittent interaction with Asn192 for approximately 11% of the simulation. In all simulations, whether there is a hydrogen bonding interaction with the ligand or not, the amide group of Asn192 is flipped.</p>
<p>To better probe the protein’s substrate preference, docking and MD simulations with the 4,4-dimethy sterol were also generated. In these models, the 4,4-dimethyl sterol also docks to the cavity in domain A with three poses of roughly equal energies (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Figs. S6D-F</xref>, <xref rid="tbls3" ref-type="table">Table S3</xref>). In one (pose <italic>Di</italic><sub>A</sub>), hydrogen bonds to Glu118, Tyr120 and Asn192 are possible; in a second (<italic>Di</italic><sub>B</sub>), hydrogen bonds to Glu118 and Tyr120 are possible; the third (<italic>Di</italic><sub>C</sub>) has a hydrogen bond to Tyr120 only. The 4,4-dimethyl sterol showed interesting behavior during the 20 ns simulations. Pose <italic>Di</italic><sub>A</sub>, which had three hydrogen bonds after ICM-Pro docking, retained all three interactions (although those with Glu118 and Tyr120 are intermittent and persist for only 12% of the simulation). Pose <italic>Di</italic><sub>B</sub> retained both interactions from the docking model, although the hydrogen bond to Tyr120 was only present for 10% of the simulation. The third pose, <italic>Di</italic><sub>C</sub>, showed the largest structural changes, losing the one interaction it had with Tyr120. In this pose, the head group of the sterol moved out of the binding pocket delineated by Glu118, Tyr120 and Asn192 and a new hydrogen bond with the carbonyl oxygen of Pro34 formed, persisting for the duration of the simulation (<xref rid="tbls3" ref-type="table">Table S3</xref>). It is possible that these differences, although subtle, explain the reduction in affinity for the dimethyl sterol substrate.</p>
<p>The aliphatic tails of all docked sterols reside in a hydrophobic cavity in domain A lined by the side chains of Tyr33, Pro34, Ala46, Met47, Met50, Ile89, Ser91, Leu92, Pro110, Ile112, Leu219, Met220, Val222, Leu244, Leu253, Cys254, Phe257, Ile259 and Phe262 in domain A. Sequence alignment shows that these residues are highly conserved between proteins in the same SSN cluster, implying their significance in forming the substrate binding pocket. Mutagenesis to remove or reduce the potential interactions with the polar head and the aliphatic tail showed subtle influences (&lt;2-fold) on the sterol binding affinity, indicating that the interaction between the protein and sterol is extensive and principally depends on hydrophobic interactions that are not easily disrupted (<xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Fig. S7</xref>). Moreover, the conformational dynamics of PBPs could mask the identity of additional residues that might be involved substrate binding and stabilization.</p>
<p>To investigate whether BstB can undergo conformational change (as most PBPs do upon substrate binding), a 150 ns molecular dynamics simulation on apo-BstB was performed. Plotting the <italic>RMSD</italic> of the simulated structure against the initial crystal structure at 25 ps intervals during the MD trajectory shows that for the first ∼90 ns the protein showed some degree of flexibility (<xref rid="figs8" ref-type="fig">Fig. S8A</xref>). During this part of the trajectory, the <italic>RMSD</italic> oscillates between 2.0 to 3.1 Å (average <italic>RMSD</italic> =2.6 Å). At ∼90 ns, there was a distinct conformational change in the structure giving rise to conformations with <italic>RMSD</italic>s ranging from 2.7 to 4.5 (average <italic>RMSD</italic> =3.3 Å). Visual analysis of the MD trajectory shows that at ∼90 ns the two domains open by approximately 20° (<xref rid="figs8" ref-type="fig">Fig. S8B</xref>, <xref rid="figm1" ref-type="fig">Movie 1</xref>). In contrast, the simulation (150 ns) on the <italic>Mono</italic><sub>C</sub> docked complex which had a <italic>RMSD</italic> of 2.6 Å for the entire length of the trajectory and did not show the same conformational change as the apo-BstB simulation, which supports the idea that the apo-BstB structure represents a “partially-open” form of the protein (<xref rid="figm2" ref-type="fig">Movie 2</xref>).</p>

Two monomers (<italic>RMSD</italic> of 0.656 Å for all Cαs) in the asymmetric unit form a dimer with 180<sup>∘</sup> rotational symmetry. Each monomer adopts an all-α-helical structure with 12 α-helices in total, designated with H1 to H12; 9 antiparallel arranged helices (H4-H12) form an irregular ring with a pore running through the center. The H4, H6, H8, H10, H12 constitute the inside wall of the pore, while the others form the outside wall. Two helices (H1-H2) at the N-terminus sit on the side-top of the ring with a short helical turn (H3) connecting the two (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>).</p>

<p>Hydrophobicity analysis shows that BstC has a predominantly hydrophilic exterior surface (<xref rid="figs9" ref-type="fig">Fig. S9A</xref>). Three cavities are found in the center of the structure. We annotated them as Tunnel 1 (TN1), Cavity 1 (CA1) and Cavity 2 (CA2), with total area of ∼ 597.1 Å<sup>2</sup> and total volume of ∼ 447 Å<sup>3</sup>. TN1 is closer to the N-terminal face of the structure, while CA1 and CA2 are proximal to the C-terminal face and form two open hydrophobic pockets. TN1 exhibits hybrid hydrophobicity, with the sides horizontal to cavities being hydrophobic while the vertical sides are more hydrophilic (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref> and <xref rid="figs9" ref-type="fig">Fig. S9B</xref>, <xref rid="tbls4" ref-type="table">Table S4</xref>). The extensive hydrophobic environment inside the BstC structure suggests it can accommodate large hydrophobic substrates. Notably, electrostatic calculation shows that most of the surface of BstC, especially the C-terminal face, exhibits strong negative charge (<xref rid="figs10" ref-type="fig">Fig. S10</xref>). These charged surfaces may mediate protein-protein interactions, perhaps with BstB.</p>
<p>A structure similarity search using the DALI server revealed high homology to Tp0956 (PDB 3U64, <italic>Treponema pallidum strain Nichols</italic>). Tp0956 is the T-component protein of a subfamily of TRAP (tripartite ATP-independent periplasmic) transporters known as TPATs (tetratricopeptide repeat-protein associated TRAP transporters), which are implicated in the transport of organic acid ligands in bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Brautigam et al., 2012</xref>). The true physiological substrate of Tp0956 has not been determined, but <italic>Treponema</italic> is a spirochete known to rely on import of host lipids and fatty acids to construct its cell envelope (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Radolf et al., 2016</xref>). Tp0956 contains four helical hairpins that are similar to tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) motifs, which are hallmarks of proteins that are involved in protein-protein interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">D’Andrea and Regan, 2003</xref>). Comparison of the structures show that two antiparallel α-helices exist in Tp0956 are missing in the structure of BstC (between H5-H6), as well as a shorter H4 and H5. But the TPR-like substructure is also observed in BstC and forms part of the pore and lateral surface of the protein, hinting that BstC might engage with itself or other proteins (<xref rid="figs11" ref-type="fig">Fig. S11</xref>). Size-exclusion chromatography coupled with multiangle light scattering (SEC-MALS) analysis shows that the purified BstC exists both as a monomer and a dimer in solution with a ratio ∼ 3:1 (<xref rid="figs12" ref-type="fig">Fig. S12</xref>). However, the role of the dimerization in this protein is not clear and its determination will require additional studies.</p>

<title>Substrate docking and molecular dynamics simulations with BstC</title>
<p>To assess substrate-binding, we performed the docking of 4-monomethyl sterol and 4,4-dimethyl sterol into the BstC structure using ICM-Pro. The final docking model was obtained by choosing the one with the most negative ICM-Pro score. All the sterols were found embedded in the hydrophobic cavity (CA1) lined by Gly128, Val131, Arg132, Met135, Ala138, Leu139, Leu142, Leu145, Leu167, Met170, Leu171, Lys174, Ala175, Pro176 and Phe208, with the hydroxyl group pointing inwards and the aliphatic tail pointed out (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref> and <xref rid="figs13" ref-type="fig">Fig. S13A-B</xref>). Residues involved in sterol interaction are located on H6, H7, H8 and H10 and are all highly conserved in a sequence alignment of the closest BstC homologs. No hydrogen bond is anticipated between the sterol and protein in the docking models, suggesting that the binding of substrate is dominated by hydrophobic interactions.</p>
<p>We then performed multiple 20 ns molecular dynamics simulations on the docked models of 4-monomethyl sterol from ICM-Pro. The simulations reveal that the substrate moves approximately 8-9 Å further into the binding site and the polar head makes a hydrogen bonding contact with the side chain of Glu86 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>). This movement takes place almost immediately and the hydrogen bond persists for 94% of the total time. In both the docking models and MD simulations, the sterol is positioned near the entrance of CA1 from the C-terminal side. Next to the entrance is an extended loop that consists of highly conserved hydrophobic and neutral residues (residues 175-184).</p>
<p>Intriguingly, simulations with the 4,4-dimethyl sterol revealed that it behaves differently in that it moves slowly inwards and does not get as deep (∼2.6 Å) into the pocket as the monomethyl sterol (<xref rid="figs13" ref-type="fig">Fig. S13C</xref>). A water-mediated contact is formed between the polar head and the side chain of Glu86 but persist for only 2% of the time. This lack of additional movement and H-bonding interaction may explain the binding data, where the protein has a <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> for the monomethyl sterol that is ∼ 30× lower than for the dimethyl sterol substrate.</p>
<p>Mutagenesis to convert Glu86 to Gly and Trp to remove or reduce the potential interactions with the polar head of the sterols leads to ∼ 4.5- and 100-fold decrease in the equilibrium affinity for 4-monomethyl sterol (<xref rid="figs14" ref-type="fig">Fig. S14A</xref>). Meanwhile, the mutagenesis eliminates the binding to 4,4-dimethyl sterol, cholesterol and lanosterol (<xref rid="figs14" ref-type="fig">Fig. S14B,C</xref>). These findings indicate that Glu86 plays a critical role in interacting with and stabilizing the sterols.</p>

<title>Comparison to eukaryotic sterol transporters</title>
<p>In most eukaryotic cells, lipid transfer proteins (LTPs) are used to transfer sterols between subcellular membranes by non-vesicular transport to maintain sterol homeostasis in different sub-cellular organelles.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Baumann et al., 2005</xref>) The most-studied family in mammals is the steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR)-related lipid transfer (START) domain (STARD) proteins. All fifteen STARD proteins identified to date possess lipid-harboring START domains that can be divided into six subfamilies based on sequence similarity and ligand specificity. In addition to STARD proteins, a novel yet evolutionarily conserved family that contain the START-like domains called the GRAMD1s/Lam/Ltc family (GRAMD1s in mammals and Lam/Ltc in yeast) was shown to mediate non-vesicular sterol transport from the plasma membrane to the endoplasmic reticulum to maintain sterol homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Gatta et al., 2015</xref>). A third family consists of the Osh/ORP/OSBP proteins (Oxysterol-binding homology in yeast and Oxysterol-binding Protein/OSBP-Related Protein in mammals), which are considered to be either sterol-sensing and/or sterol-transfer proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Raychaudhuri and Prinz, 2010</xref>). Besides these, two Niemann-Pick type C proteins, NPC1 and NPC2, were also reported to directly bind and transport cholesterols and various oxysterols; defective NPC proteins causes NPC disease, a fetal neurodegenerative disorder where sterols aberrantly accumulate in the lysosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Carstea et al., 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>To better understand the differences between eukaryote and bacteria sterol transport, we compared the structures of BstB and BstC with well-studied eukaryotic sterol transporters from different families. Human STARD4 (PDB 6L1D), yeast Lam4 (PDB 6BYM), yeast Osh4 (PDB 1ZI7 and 1ZHY), yeast NPC2 (PDB 6R4M and 6R4N), as well as a non-specific cytosolic sterol carrier protein, rabbit SCP2 (PDB 1C44) were chosen for the comparison. The crystal structures of STARD4, Lam4 and Osh4 show that they share a similar fold in that they are dominated by β-sheet motifs, which wrap around the longest α-helix and fold into a half-barrel/groove structure with the other side (or two) packed with several α-helices (<xref rid="figs15" ref-type="fig">Fig. S15A-D</xref>). A central hydrophobic cavity can accommodate sterols. In most cases, the sterols are positioned proximal to the tunnel entrance with the hydroxyl end oriented towards the inside of the tunnel. Also, a “lid” comprising a flexible “Ω1” loop is observed near the entrance of tunnel in STARD4 and sterol-bound Lam4. This loop is replaced by an N-terminal α-helix in Osh4, which serves a similar function. The SCP2 structure also exhibits an α/β-fold with a “lid”-like α-helix observed close to the N-terminus (<xref rid="figs15" ref-type="fig">Fig. S15E</xref>). The sterol-bond NPC2 adopts a different immunoglobulin-like β-sandwich fold with seven strands arranged into two β-sheets with a loosely packed hydrophobic cavity formed between the two sheets. The sterol is positioned at the entrance of the cavity with the hydroxyl end pointing out; no “lid”-like structure is observed in NPC2 structure (<xref rid="figs15" ref-type="fig">Fig. S15F-G</xref>).</p>
<p>Our comparative analysis shows that the eukaryotic sterol transporters share very little resemblance with BstB and BstC. The bilobed architecture of BstB is pronounced in its divergence from eukaryotic sterol transporters, suggesting that this protein evolved separately and may work in a distinct manner. For the all-helical BstC, the only similarities are the presence of a hydrophobic tunnel formed in the center of the protein that can accommodate sterols, and a loop next to the tunnel’s entrance that may also be used as a “lid” to restrict access to the substrate binding site (<xref rid="figs15" ref-type="fig">Fig. S15H</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Since their discovery more than 40 years ago, the function of bacterial sterols has remained a mystery. Recent identification of bacterial sterol demethylase enzymes that diverge from their eukaryotic counterparts provided renewed enthusiasm for deciphering the molecular machinery involved in bacterial sterol synthesis and trafficking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Lee et al., 2018</xref>). The aerobic methanotroph <italic>M. capsulatus</italic> is known to synthesize 4-monomethyl sterol from 4,4-dimethyl sterol and to accumulate these sterols in its outer membrane. Until now, the transport process remained elusive owing to lack of knowledge of transporters that facilitate the trafficking. We now fill this gap with the identification of potential transporters of C-4 methyl sterols in <italic>M. capsulatus</italic>: BstA, BstB and BstC.</p>
<p>Bioinformatic analyses revealed that BstA, BstB, and BstC belong to well-studied families of bacterial metabolite transporters. High resolution structures of BstB and BstC show that their large ligand binding sites display a dichotomy of hydrophobic and hydrophilic amino acids whose sidechains interact with the sterol hydrophobic tail and hydrophilic head. For BstC, this is especially interesting, as the only other family member characterized, Tp0956 from <italic>Treponema pallidum</italic>, displays a similar dichotomous ligand site. <italic>Treponema pallidum</italic>, the causative agent of syphilis, is a spirochete known to acquire and use host lipids– it is possible that Tp0956, and perhaps other T-component proteins, are involved in lipid trafficking.</p>
<p>In summary, the Bst proteins share sequence and structural homology with bacterial transporters involved in the trafficking of essential nutrients such as sugars, amino acids, vitamins, solutes, and metal ions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Davidson et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Higgins, 1992</xref>). Their implication in the transport of sterols expands the substrate repertoire for their respective families. The substrate binding sites observed in BstB and BstC should now enable the curation of functionally homologous sites in bacterial proteins, including in those from human pathogens known to traffic host lipids.</p>

<p>The SSNs were generated using EFI-EST sever (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://efi.igb.illinois.edu/efi-est/stepa.php">http://efi.igb.illinois.edu/efi-est/stepa.php</ext-link>). Proteins are represented by nodes. Only the nodes that share pairwise sequence alignments greater than the user-specified value will be connected by edges to create a network that reveals potential functional relationships among the proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Atkinson et al., 2009</xref>). HMMER webserver (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/hmmer/">https://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/hmmer/</ext-link>) was used to predict the superfamilies of Bst proteins. BstA is predicted to be a member of MMPL family (pfam03176 or IPR004869). Because some homologs are not annotated in the pfam family, we first used the Blast function to identify proteins sharing homology with BstA in UniProtKB (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.uniprot.org">www.uniprot.org</ext-link>). Homologs within the cutoff value of 5.3×10<sup>-80</sup> were also submitted to the SSN creation. The SSN was generated using the EFI-EST online tool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Gerlt et al., 2015</xref>) with an E-value threshold of 10<sup>-60</sup> (∼35% sequence identity); with this threshold, BstA proteins were grouped into a single cluster. UniRef50 (&gt;50% sequence identity merged into a single node) was used to facilitate the calculation and save time during the SSN creation. BstB belongs to a family of ABC transporter phosphonate periplasmic substrate-binding proteins (pfam12974); this Pfam was selected to create an SSN at E-value threshold of 10<sup>-50</sup> (∼40% sequence identity). Homologous proteins found in the UniprotKB (cutoff at 1.6×10<sup>-62</sup>) were added to the network as well. UniRef90 standard (≥90% sequence identity merged into a single node) was used to create the BstB SSN. BstC is classified as a member of the TRAP transporter T-component superfamily (IPR038537), which are thought to facilitate the import of small molecules into cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Radolf et al., 2016</xref>). An SSN was constructed with this dataset and the homologous genes found in the UniprotKB (cut-off at 6.1×10<sup>-39</sup>) at E-value threshold of 10<sup>-55</sup> (∼40% sequence identity). Cystoscope software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Shannon et al., 2003</xref>) was used to visualize the SSNs with the “organic” layout. The genome neighborhood network and diagram were generated using the Enzyme Function Initiative-Genome Neighborhood Tool (EFI-GNT; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://efi.igb.illinois.edu/efi-gnt/">https://efi.igb.illinois.edu/efi-gnt/</ext-link>) with the SSNs generated above. The neighborhood reading frame was set to 10 frames and the minimal co-occurrence was set to 20%.</p>

<title>Protein expression and purification</title>
<p>The genomic DNA of <italic>M. capsulatus</italic> texas was subjected to several rounds of PCR to isolate the genes encoding BstB and BstC without their respective signal peptides (cleavage sites determined by the SignalP 5.0 server (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Armenteros et al., 2019</xref>)). The final gene products were assembled into pET-28a vectors containing TEV-cleavable N-terminal hexa-histidine (His-) tags or pET-20b vectors containing C-terminal His-tags. DNA sequencing of the plasmids confirmed the correct insertion of the genes. The BstA<sup>PD</sup> gene was synthesized and inserted into pET-28a after codon optimization for expression in <italic>E. coli</italic>. The soluble periplasmic domain of BstA (BstA<sup>PD</sup>) was designed based on the structure predicted by AlphaFold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Jumper et al., 2021</xref>). Briefly, two fragments spanning residues 54-277 and 510-732 were connected by a GSGSGSGS linker to replace the membrane-spanning sequence. The DNA encoding BstA<sup>PD</sup> was cloned into pET28a. All the protein sequences and primers are listed in <xref rid="tbls5" ref-type="table">Table S5</xref>.</p>
<p>BstA<sup>PD</sup>, BstB (residues 24-281) and BstC (residues 16-264) proteins were expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic> BL21(DE3) cells and grown at 37 °C until OD<sub>600nm</sub> of 0.6. Protein expression was induced upon the addition of 0.25 mM isopropyl β-D-1thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) while shaking at 18 °C for 12h. Cells were harvested through centrifugation at 8000 × g for 15 min and resuspended in lysis buffer containing 25 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 100 mM NaCl, 2 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, and 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF). Cells were lysed by microfluidization and centrifuged at 11,000 × <italic>g</italic> for 40 min to remove cell debris. The supernatant was applied to a Ni-NTA affinity column (HiTrap IMAC FF, Cytiva product # 17092104), washed with lysis buffer supplemented with 15 mM imidazole to remove weakly bound proteins, and eluted with lysis buffer containing 300 mM imidazole. The eluate was concentrated and applied to a size-exclusion column (HiLoad 16/600 Superdex 200 pg, Cytiva product # 28989335) to remove additional contaminants, and purity was assessed through gel electrophoresis.</p>
<p>Selenium-methionine (Se-Met) labeled BstB and BstC were produced by supplementing the endogenous methionine synthesis of the expression host with Se-Met. The cells were cultured in M9 minimal media until OD<sub>600nm</sub> of 0.4. L-lysine (100 mg/L), L-phenylalanine (100 mg/L), L-threonine (100 mg/L), L-isoleucine (50 mg/L), L-leucine (50 mg/L) and L-valine (50 mg/L) and L-Se-Met (60 mg/L) were added to the media. 0.25 mM IPTG was added after 1h to commence induction and cells were cultured for an additional 12h at 18°C before harvesting. The proteins were purified by the protocol described above.</p>
<p>The N-terminal His-tags of proteins were removed during overnight incubation at room temperature with TEV protease at a molar ratio of 1:100 (TEV: protein). Proteins without tags were further purified by size-exclusion chromatography. The molecular weight of proteins was determined by SEC-MALS (Wyatt Technology). The purity of all purified proteins was assessed using SDS-PAGE stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue, after which aliquots of the purest fractions were flash-cooled in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 °C.</p>

<title>Sterols extraction from <italic>M. capsulatus</italic></title>
<p>Lipids were extracted from cell pellets of 2 L <italic>M. capsulatus</italic> cultures using a modified Bligh-Dyer extraction method as previously described.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Lee et al., 2018</xref>) Cells were re-suspended in 10:5:4 (vol:vol:vol) methanol: dichloromethane (DCM):water and sonicated for 1 hour. The organic phase was separated with 1:1 (vol:vol) DCM:water, later washed three times with DCM and then transferred to a clean vial and dried with N<sub>2</sub> to yield the total lipids extraction (TLE). The TLE was further purified using Silica column chromatography to isolate the alcohol soluble lipids.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Summons et al., 2013</xref>) The TLE was further purified using hand-packed silica column and lipids were eluted using solvent solutions of different polarities (Hexane, 8:2 Hexane:DCM, DCM, 1:1 DCM:Ethyl Acetate, Ethyl acetate). The alcohol soluble lipids (HS fraction) were eluted with 1:1 DCM:Ethyl Acetate. The HS fraction was then dried with N<sub>2</sub> and dissolved in DMSO. The 4-methylsterol and 4,4-dimethylsterol were purified from the alcohol soluble lipids by liquid-chromatograph (LC) using an Agilent 1260 Infinity II LC System. Briefly, lipids were run through a InfinityLab Poroshell120 EC-C18 column (4.6 x 150 mm, 2.7 Micron). The solvent system consisted of Solvent A: MeOH (with .04% formic acid and 0.1% ammonia), Solvent B: acetonitrile, and Solvent C: Water (with .04% formic acid and 0.1% ammonia). The solvent gradient started with 84% Solvent A, 1% Solvent B, and 15% Solvent C and ended with 100% Solvent A over the course of 50 minutes. Isolated sterols were derivatized to trimethylsilyl ethers with 1:1 (vol:vol) Bis(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide: pyridine and confirmed using GC-MS analysis as described in Lee et al, PNAS 2018.</p>

<title>Protein-lipid pull down assay</title>
<p>Proteins (BstA<sup>PD</sup>, BstB, BstC) were incubated with two different <italic>M. capsulatus</italic> lipid extracts: total lipid extractions (TLE) or the enriched sterol fraction (HS), both dissolved in DMSO. The TLE (139.5 µg total) contained 65.7 ng of 4-monomethyl sterol and 338.9 ng of 4,4-dimethyl sterol. The HS fraction (99.5 µg total) contained 313.8 ng and 967 ng of 4-monomethyl sterol and 4,4-dimethyl sterol, respectively. The experimental reaction conditions are as follows: 40 µM protein (BstA<sup>PD</sup>, BstB, BstC) was incubated with 7.5 µL of either the TLE or HS lipids. The reactions were carried out in reaction buffer of 200 mM HEPES pH 8.0, 100mM NaCl and 0.05% Triton X-100. During the negative control reactions, the proteins were incubated with DMSO that did not contain any lipids. This serves as (1) a vehicle control since the <italic>M. capsulatus</italic> TLE and HS fractions were dissolved in DMSO and (2) to determine whether C4-methylsterols were bound to the Bst proteins as a result of protein expression in <italic>E. coli</italic>. The reactions (both control and experiment) were incubated at 25 °C for 20 hours. The proteins were purified using HisPur Ni-NTA his resin (Thermos Fisher), lipids from the eluted protein fractions were extracted using a modified Bligh Dyer protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Ekiert et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Lee et al., 2018</xref>) and lipid samples were analyzed by GC-MS as previously described. HisPur Ni-NTA wash buffer: 25 mM Tris pH 8.0,100 mM NaCl and elution buffer: 25 mM Tris pH 8.0,100 mM NaCl, 300mM imidazole. SDS PAGE electrophoresis was conducted to demonstrate that the fractions analyzed did in fact contain protein.</p>

<p>Microscale thermophoresis (MST) experiments were performed with NanoTemper Monolith NT.115 instrument according to the manufacturer’s instructions (NanoTemper Technologies). In brief, His-tagged BstA<sup>PD</sup>, BstB and BstC were fluorescently labeled with Monolith His-Tag Labeling Kit RED-tris-NTA 2<sup>nd</sup> Generation according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The 4-methylsterol and 4,4-dimethylsterol were extracted from <italic>M. capsulatus</italic>, while lanosterol (CAS:79630, Sigma-Aldrich) and cholesterol (CAS: AAA1147018, Fisher Scientific) were prepared in DMSO with a final stock concentration of 3.9 mM and 7.76 mM, respectively.</p>
<p>50 nM of labeled proteins were diluted in assay buffer (20 mM HEPES pH 8.0, 100 mM NaCl, and 0.05% Tween 20), in the presence of sixteen-step serial dilution of 4-methylsterols or 4,4-dimethylsterols (ligand solubilized in DMSO at a final constant concentration of 5%). After incubation, samples were loaded into Monolith NT.115 Premium Capillaries (NanoTemper Technologies) and measurements were taken at a constant temperature of 23 °C. MST traces were collected with an LED excitation power of 40% and an MST laser power of 40%. The MO.

Briefly, chain A of the BstB and BstC crystal structure was used as the rigid receptor. Each protein molecule was converted to an ICM object, with optimization of hydrogen atom placement. Potential binding site were identified using the pocketfinder feature of ICM-Pro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Abagyan and Kufareva, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">An et al., 2005</xref>); for BstB and BstC the largest pockets had volumes of 1050 A<sup>3</sup> and 670 A<sup>3</sup>, respectively. The coordinates of the C-4 methylated sterols (4-monomethylsterol and 4,4-dimethylsterol) were generated using the ICM-Pro ligand editing tools, based upon the structure of cholesterol. The ligands were docked into the binding pockets in both protein receptors. The MA-1-206 docking runs were performed multiple times, results were ranked in order to the overall score, and the most energetically favored binding modes were extracted from ICM-Pro as PDB files. Additional docking runs with BstB were carried out where three residues (Glu118, Tyr120 and Asn192) were allowed to have rotationally flexible side chains to simulate induced fit docking, using the explicit group docking feature of ICM-Pro, while the rest of the protein remained rigid.

<p>Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were performed in triplicate on models comprising BstB and BstC docked with 4-monomethylsterol and 4,4-dimethylsterol, using Desmond (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Bowers et al., 2006</xref>) in the Schrodinger 2019-2 release. The docked complexes were prepared with Maestro (Schrodinger) using the OPLS3e force field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Roos et al., 2019</xref>). The pre-defined TIP3P water model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Neria et al., 1996</xref>) was used to build the system. The overall charge of the complexes was calculated as -1 and -10 for BstB and BstC respectively and neutralized with Na<sup>+</sup> ions. Prior to building in system for both complexes, 0.15 M salt (NaCl) was added, and the ions were restricted from coming within 20 Å of the ligand. The systems were minimized prior to the final 20 ns production step runs at 300 K and 1 atm pressure, using the Nosé–Hoover chain coupling scheme for the temperature control and the Martyna–Tuckerman–Klein chain coupling scheme with a coupling constant of 2.0 ps for pressure control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Martyna et al., 1992</xref>). Nonbonded forces were calculated using an r-RESPA integrator. The trajectories were saved at 10 ps intervals for analysis. For the 150 ns simulation on apo-BstB, the same protein preparation steps and variable settings were used except the trajectories were saved every 25 ps for analysis.

<p>This is a <bold>valuable</bold> contribution to our understanding of how some bacteria can transport sterols from the cytoplasm to the outer membrane. Though much remains to be tested and explored, the data and analyses presented here provide <bold>solid</bold> evidence for the genetic and physical interaction of BstA/B/C with bacterially-produced sterols. The manuscript will be of interest to scientists focusing on the characterization of novel bacterial proteins and those studying lipid transport and acquisition in bacterial pathogens.</p>

<p>Summary</p>
<p>
This article by Zhai et al, investigates sterol transport in bacteria. Synthesis of sterols is rare in bacteria but occurs in some, such as M capsulatus where the sterols are found primarily in the outer membrane. In a previous paper the authors discovered an operon consisting of five genes, with two of these genes encoding demethylases involved in sterol demethylation. In this manuscript, the authors set out to investigate the functions of the other three genes in the operon. Interestingly, through a bioinformatic analysis, they show that they are an inner membrane transporter of the RND family, a periplasmic binding protein, and an outer membrane-associated protein, all potentially involved with lipid transport, so providing a means of transporting the lipids to the outer membrane. These proteins are then extensively investigated through lipid pulldowns, binding analysis on all three, and X-ray crystallography and docking of the latter two.</p>
<p>Strengths</p>
<p>
The lipid pulldowns and associated MST binding analysis are convincing, clearly showing that sterols are able to bind to these proteins. The structures of BstB and BstC are high resolution with excellent maps that allow docking studies to be carried out. These structures are distinct from sterol-binding proteins in eukaryotes.</p>
<p>Weaknesses</p>
<p>
While the docking and molecular dynamics studies are consistent with the binding of sterols to BstB and BstC, this is not backed up particularly well. The MST results of mutants in the binding pocket of BstB have relatively little effect, and while I agree with the authors this may be because of the extensive hydrophobic interactions that the ligand makes with the protein, it is difficult to make any firm conclusions about binding.</p>
<p>The authors also discuss the possibility of a secondary binding site in BstB based on a slight cavity in domain B next to a flexible loop. This is not backed up in any way and seems unlikely.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
In eukaryotes, sterols are crucial for signaling and regulating membrane fluidity, however, the mechanism governing cholesterol production and transport across the cell membrane in bacteria remains enigmatic. The manuscript by Zhai et al. sheds light on this topic by uncovering three potential cholesterol transport proteins. Through comprehensive bioinformatics analysis, the authors identified three genes bstA, bstB, and bstC encoding proteins which share homology with transporters, periplasmic binding proteins, and periplasmic components superfamily, respectively. Furthermore, the authors confirmed the specific interaction between these three proteins and C-4 methylated sterols and determined the structures of BstB and BstC. Combining these structural insights with molecular dynamics simulation, they postulated several plausible substrate binding sites within each protein.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
The authors have identified 3 proteins that seem likely to be involved in sterol transport between the inner and outer membrane. The structures are of high quality, and the sterol binding experiments support a role for these proteins in sterol transport.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
While the author's model is very plausible, direct evidence for a role of BstABC in transport, or that the 3 proteins function together in a single pathway, is limited.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
The work in this manuscript builds on prior efforts by this team to understand how sterols are biosynthesized and utilized in bacteria. The study reports a new function for three genes encoded near sterol biosynthesis enzymes, suggesting the resulting proteins function as a sterol transport system. Biochemical and structural characterization of the two soluble components of the pathway establishes that both proteins can bind sterols, with a preference for 4-methylated derivatives. High-resolution x-ray structures of the apoproteins reveal hydrophobic cavities of the appropriate size to accommodate these substrates. Docking and molecular dynamics simulations confirm this observation and provide specific insights into residues involved in substrate binding.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
The manuscript is comprehensive and well-written. The annotation of a new function in a set of proteins related to bacterial sterol usage is exciting and likely to enable further study of this phenomenon - which is currently not well understood. The work also has implications for improving our understanding of lipid usage in general among bacterial organisms.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
The authors might consider moving some of the bioinformatics figures to the main text, given how much space is devoted to this topic in the results section.</p>
