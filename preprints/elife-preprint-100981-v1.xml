<title>Abstract</title><p>Push-pull systems for sustainable pest management of crop plants employ repellent stimuli from intercrops (“push”) to repel herbivores and attract their predators and parasitoids, and attracting stimuli from border plants (“pull”) to lead herbivorous insects out of the crop. The most widespread implementation, intercropping with the legume <italic>Desmodium</italic>, reduces herbivory damage from the invasive fall armyworm (FAW) <italic>Spodoptera frugiperda</italic>. However, the three publications to date investigating underlying mechanisms disagree whether the <italic>Desmodium</italic> intercrop emits bioactive volatiles that repel FAW. We aimed to resolve this controversy by measuring volatile emission from <italic>Desmodium intortum</italic> (greenleaf <italic>Desmodium</italic>) and <italic>D. incanum</italic> intercrops in push-pull fields, and assaying their effects on the behavior of the FAW in oviposition and wind tunnel choice bioassays. We detected many volatile substances in the headspaces of both <italic>Desmodium</italic> species, which exhibited similar profiles, including substances previously reported to repel lepidopteran herbivores. FAW moths preferred to oviposit on maize over <italic>Desmodium</italic>, but not on maize further from versus closer to <italic>Desmodium</italic> plants that were inaccessible to the moths, but sharing the air. In a wind tunnel bioassay, the moths tended to prefer maize volatiles over a combination of volatiles from maize and <italic>D. intortum</italic>, but not <italic>D. incanum</italic>. In conclusion, we found <italic>D. intortum</italic> and <italic>D. incanum</italic> to emit volatiles that have been shown to be bioactive, and FAW moths to prefer maize over either <italic>Desmodium</italic> species. Moreover, additional mechanisms are likely important for reducing FAW damage to maize under push-pull cultivation.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The sustainable intensification of agriculture is essential to achieve Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 2, zero hunger, and reduce hidden costs of meeting requirements of other SDGs such as 13, climate action (FAO et al., 2020). This is particularly important in the developing Global South where larger yield gaps are observed compared to the developed countries with more financial resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">David Tilman et al., 2011</xref>). Intercropping may offer sustainable solutions with potential for strong positive effects on pest and disease control as well as associated biodiversity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Beillouin et al., 2021</xref>).</p>
<p>The concept of “push-pull” mixed cropping was first reported in 1987 as a “stimulo-deterrence” strategy for the reduction of pest damage in cotton, combining a pest repellent intercrop (“push“) interspersed with the main crop, and an attractant border crop (“pull“) to trap pests at the field perimeter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Bruce et al., 1987</xref>). As most widely practiced, current push-pull systems benefit from the attractive and repellent stimuli of perennial inter- and border crops (referred to as companion crops), thereby reducing or eliminating the need for pesticides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Pickett et al., 2014</xref>). In Kenya, the first push-pull system, introduced in 1997, was designed to reduce yield losses caused by stemborer species and comprised a combination of the main crop maize (<italic>Zea mays</italic> L), the intercrop molasses grass (<italic>Melinis minutiflora</italic>), and the border crop Napier grass (<italic>Pennisetum purpureum</italic>) or Sudan grass (<italic>Sorghum vulgare sudanense</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Khan et al., 1997b</xref>).</p>
<p>Several volatile substances emitted from molasses grass repelled female stem borers and simultaneously attracted their parasitoid <italic>Cotesia sesamiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Khan et al., 1997a</xref><bold/>). Following the initial success of this system, there was interest in replacing molasses grass with a leguminous repellent intercrop that could improve soil quality by fixing nitrogen, and provide high-quality fodder. The legumes silverleaf <italic>Desmodium</italic> (<italic>Desmodium uncinatum</italic>) and its congeneric (<italic>Desmodium intortum</italic>) were shown to repel ovipositing stem borers and furthermore to suppress parasitic <italic>Striga</italic> weeds. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Khan et al., 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19"> 2002</xref><bold/>). The first <italic>Desmodium</italic>-intercropped version of push-pull used <italic>D. uncinatum</italic> in place of <italic>M. minutiflora</italic> together with <italic>P. purpureum</italic>. As a result of screening for more drought-tolerant companion plants, a version using <italic>D. intortum</italic> combined with the border crop <italic>Brachiaria</italic> cv Mulato II was developed as “climate-adapted push-pull“, which has been demonstrated to increase maize yield by a factor of 2.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Midega et al., 2015</xref>). Recently, a “third generation” push-pull system was evaluated using the intercrop <italic>D. incanum</italic> to replace <italic>D. intortum</italic> – which does not flower and set seed in many parts of tropical Africa and thus limits adoption and spread of push-pull by limiting seed supply for the intercrop – with <italic>Brachiaria brizantha</italic> cv Xaraes as border crop, which is more resistant to herbivorous mites that attack the mulato cultivar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Cheruiyot et al., 2021</xref>).</p>
<p>The invasive fall armyworm (FAW), <italic>Spodoptera frugiperda</italic>, originating from a maize-specialized strain from northern and central America, has become a major threat to African maize crops since 2016 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Goergen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Day et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Hailu et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Zhang et al., 2023</xref>). It spread rapidly through East Africa, with most of the farmers in Ethiopia and Kenya encountering the FAW after the long rains in the first half of 2017 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Kumela et al., 2018</xref>). The invasiveness of the moth is fueled by its relatively short life cycle of about four weeks and the capability of the adult females to lay hundreds of eggs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Sparks, 1979</xref>). Other traits favoring the FAW’s spread in Africa and beyond are its strong flight capacity, lack of diapause, reported survival in diverse habitats, rapid development of resistance to insecticides / viruses, and the polyphagous nature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Wan et al., 2021</xref>). Although its wide host range of at least 353 host species across 76 plant families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Montezano et al., 2018</xref>), the high financial and yield losses on the main crop maize due to the pest are particularly devastating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Eschen et al., 2021</xref>). The FAW is reported to outcompete resident stemborers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Hailu et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Sokame et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Mutyambai et al., 2022</xref>). The use of pesticides is a popular approach to control the FAW, posing risks to environmental and human health, which includes acute pesticide-related illnesses as many smallholder farmers do not use personal protective equipment while spraying (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Tambo et al., 2020</xref>). Therefore, sole reliance on pesticides is not sufficient to manage FAW sustainably, and Integrated Pest Management (IPM) strategies, such as the promotion of natural enemies, are desirable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Nyamutukwa et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Van den Berg and du Plessis, 2022</xref>). Climate-adapted and third-generation push-pull systems have been reported to reduce plant damage and yield loss caused by the FAW (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Midega et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Hailu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Cheruiyot et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Yeboah et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Mutyambai et al., 2022</xref>).</p>
<p>A systematic review on the chemical ecology of push-pull systems by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Lang et al., (2022)</xref>) found only thirty publications (seven primary sources, and 23 publications reporting on results from these primary sources) on the chemistry of push-pull and related mixed-cropping systems, from which 206 compounds were reported to be potentially associated with push and pull effects. Of these, 101 were categorized as plant volatiles and reported by studies with a focus on plant-insect interactions (as opposed to studies with a focus on <italic>Striga</italic> control). However, none of these publications reported volatiles sampled under field conditions. Two recent papers, both published after the literature review conducted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Lang et al., (2022)</xref>), reported additional potentially bioactive compounds from companion plants in maize-<italic>Desmodium</italic>-grass push-pull systems, and both publications supported the hypothesis that volatiles from the companion crop <italic>D. intortum</italic> repel the FAW and attract parasitic wasps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Sobhy et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Peter et al., 2023</xref>). In contrast, a third recent publication by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Erdei et al., (2024)</xref> detected low levels of volatiles from <italic>D. intortum</italic> plants and found no consistent preference of FAW for maize over either <italic>D. intortum</italic> or maize together with <italic>D. intortum</italic>, and concluded that the protective effects of the intercrop were more likely to result from physical trapping of FAW larvae.</p>
<p>Thus, further investigations are needed to understand the mechanisms by which the maize-<italic>Desmodium</italic>-grass push-pull system can protect maize from FAW. A summary of the studies to date on push-pull effects on the FAW can be found in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>. To our knowledge, no data on plant volatiles from the more drought-resistant <italic>D. incanum</italic> have been published so far. Therefore, this paper focuses on the volatiles of <italic>D. intortum</italic> and <italic>D. incanum</italic> and the effects of exposure to the headspaces of these plants, versus direct exposure to the plants, on the invasive pest FAW. We collected volatiles from plants in farmers’ fields as well as in bioassay setups under semi-field con-ditions, and conducted oviposition and flight tunnel bioassays to assess FAW moth preferences.</p>

<caption><p>Studies to date on push-pull effects on the fall armyworm (FAW) embedded in the mechanisms according to the current state of knowledge of the system. Volatiles (and potentially other traits) of the intercrop repel the herbivorous insect and additionally attract its parasitoids, while volatiles (and potentially other traits) of the border crop attract herbivores away from the main crop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Pickett et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Khan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Eigenbrode et al., 2016</xref>). The pull effect of the border crop Napier grass, <italic>Pennisetum purpureum</italic> was observed in earlier systems, as it attracted stemborers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Khan et al., 1997b</xref>), but could not be confirmed for the FAW with the border crop <italic>Brachiaria</italic> cv Mulato II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Sobhy et al., 2022</xref>).

In the comparison between field <italic>Desmodium</italic> plants, and potted bioassay plants that were sampled in a smaller number, the majority of substances showed a higher relative abundance in potted <italic>D. incanum</italic> (bioassay conditions), whereas in <italic>D. intortum</italic>, some substances occurred in higher concentrations in the potted plants, while others were not detected. Sixteen of the volatiles detected in <italic>Desmodium</italic> plants in farmers’ fields were also present in either uninfested or infested maize plants, with 14 substances overlapping (see <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>).</p>

<p>Two-thirds of the moths tested showed ten or fewer segment changes during the five minutes of each experiment.

Push-pull cropping systems benefit from the attractive and repellent stimuli of perennial companion crops (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Pickett et al., 2014</xref>), with more than one hundred plant volatiles from different classes, especially terpenoids and fatty acid-derived “green leaf” volatiles, reported to be associated with push-pull effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Lang et al., 2022</xref>). Nevertheless, the repellent role of volatiles from greenleaf <italic>Desmodium</italic> (<italic>D. intortum</italic>) has been investigated in only three studies and almost exclusively in potted plants, with conflicting reports of whether these volatiles repel FAW moths, and the only study reporting field measurements recovering few volatiles in relatively low abundance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Sobhy et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Peter et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Erdei et al., 2024</xref>). Here, we characterized volatiles sampled from both <italic>D. intortum</italic> (greenleaf <italic>Desmodium</italic>) and <italic>D. incanum</italic> growing in farmer fields or in pots, and conducted bioassays with FAW moths to determine whether the presence of <italic>Desmodium</italic> plants or their volatiles would alter moth preferences for maize. We identified up to 17 - 19 substances in headspace samples from <italic>Desmodium</italic> plants, often in abundance similar to or greater than volatiles measured from maize plants under comparable conditions, and we observed that FAW moths preferred to oviposit on maize rather than on <italic>Desmodium</italic> plants of either species. However, proximity to a <italic>Desmodium</italic> plant sharing the airspace did not influence FAW oviposition preferences for maize in a greenhouse cage choice assay, nor did FAW moths show a significant preference for maize volatiles over volatiles from a combination of maize and <italic>Desmodium</italic> plants in a wind tunnel choice assay. We note that these assays were performed in a risk area for malaria and other mosquito-borne illnesses, and so experimenters were protected with DEET, which has low volatility but is active in the vapor phase, where it can cause host avoidance by binding to insect olfactory receptors (although this has been mostly studied in the dipterans <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> and <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">DeGennaro, 2015</xref>). We reduced any potential influence on the lepidopteran in our experiments by using minimal amounts of DEET, avoiding direct contact of any DEET with experimental materials, and conducting behavioral assays without the insects being exposed to volatiles from the experimenter (experimenters were generally not present during oviposition assays, and the insects were in an isolated airspace during wind tunnel bioassays). We conclude that <italic>Desmodium</italic> plants in push-pull cultivation emit known bioactive volatiles, but cannot confirm that these volatiles alone repel FAW moths based on our bioassays, and therefore suggest that other features of the maize-<italic>Desmodium</italic>-border grass push-pull system, including the influence of border grasses as well as belowground interactions and other repellent traits of <italic>Desmodium</italic>, may be important for protecting maize from FAW moths and their larvae.</p>

<title>Emission of Potentially Bioactive Volatiles by <bold><italic>Desmodium</italic></bold> Intercrops</title>
<p>The headspace of <italic>Desmodium</italic> plants was dynamically sampled on Tenax TA adsorbent directly in push-pull fields, as well as from potted plants used for oviposition bioassays, overnight.</p>
<p>All substances occurring in fewer than 2/3 of the field samples were excluded from further analysis, which represents an arbitrary limit. Quantitative comparisons within single substances are possible, but must be handled with care, as normalization based on the biomass and leaf area of the plants was not possible. The chosen adsorbent, Tenax TA, is known to be effective for lipophilic to medium-polarity organic compounds of intermediate molecular weight (ca. C7-C26) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Dettmer and Engewald, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Tholl et al., 2020</xref>). It is possible that headspace samples changed during storage (up to 3 months tightly closed at room temperature) as degradation or thermal rearrangements on Tenax TA material have been reported before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Dettmer and Engewald, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Alborn et al., 2021</xref>). We extracted headspace samples using thermal desorption, which is simple and sensitive, but not appropriate for some compounds, such as the sesquiterpene germacrene A, which are susceptible to thermal rearrangement or degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Tholl et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Despite these caveats, our samples yielded a variety of volatiles with high signal:noise ratios, of which 13 had been previously reported from sampling the headspace of potted <italic>D. intortum</italic> plants onto Porapak Q for sampling durations of 24 h or 48 h followed by solvent extraction and GC-MS analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Sobhy et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Peter et al., 2023</xref>). In contrast, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Erdei et al., (2024)</xref> detected fewer volatiles in lower relative abundance from <italic>D. intortum</italic> using solid-phase microextraction (SPME) and a saturation time of 18 - 24h to sample intact, mechanically damaged or herbivoryinduced potted plants or intact plants in Tanzanian and Ugandan fields. Our study is the only one of these that limited the window of sampling strictly to the nighttime hours corresponding to the reported activity window for the FAW(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Sparks, 1979</xref>). In pretests no shorter activity window could be determined as the moths still showed mating behaviour and potential oviposition at around midnight (see <xref rid="s7" ref-type="sec">Appendix 1</xref>). Differences might be explained due to the different use of sampling techniques, as the sensitivity of SPME is lower in comparison to dynamic headspace collection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Tholl et al., 2006</xref>). To our knowledge, the volatile profile of <italic>D. incanum</italic> was not previously reported. In conclusion, the hypothesis that <italic>D. intortum</italic> and <italic>D. incanum</italic> emit potentially bioactive volatiles is supported.</p>

<title>Oviposition Choice Bioassay</title>
<p>FAW oviposition behaviour was observed over three nights in two treatments per <italic>Desmodium</italic> species. In one treatment, FAW moths had direct contact with <italic>Desmodium</italic> plants and in another, they had only indirect contact through aerial exposure to plants outside of, but directly next to a mesh cage. Moths always had direct contact with maize plants.</p>
<p>Critical consideration must be given to differences in the volatile profiles between the potted plants and those measured in farmers’ fields, which led to a separation of potted and field <italic>D. intortum</italic> in the second dimension of a PCA, and a near-separation of <italic>D. incanum</italic> in the first dimension. As the untargeted analysis was conducted based on the field <italic>Desmodium</italic> samples, any volatile substances that only occur in the potted plants were not identified or analyzed further (full results of GC-MS analysis are available with the source data for this publication). Oviposition on maize can alter the maize volatile profile and affect volatile emission in the following days, which is why the maize samples are divided into plants before and after (infested) oviposition exposure. Of the substances occurring in field <italic>Desmodium</italic> plants, approximately half were abundant in healthy and infested potted maize plants, with only one substance, (<italic>E</italic>)-α-Bergamotene, being present solely in infested maize plants. The sampling of potted plants was conducted using the same procedure as in the field, but in a greenhouse with netted walls on two sides that allowed air circulation as for the oviposition bioassays. Overall, this highlights the importance of studying oviposition cues and moth preferences directly in push-pull fields in the future.</p>
<p>In all treatments, the number of eggs laid per batch showed no difference depending on the position, which indicates that FAW moths did not adjust their behavior once they started laying eggs. This differs slightly from the outcomes reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Peter et al., (2023)</xref>, where a reduction in egg number per batch was observed and the number of eggs, but not the number of egg batches, differed between maize vs. maize + <italic>D. intortum</italic>. However, a clear preference for maize compared to the two <italic>Desmodium</italic> species was observed in the treatments where FAW moths had direct contact with both plant species, with a large effect size of 7 – 8 times more eggs on maize than on <italic>Desmodium</italic>. The preference of maize over <italic>D. intortum</italic> in oviposition assays with direct contact to both plants is consistent with various publications using similarly controlled setups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Sobhy et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Peter et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Erdei et al., 2024</xref>). There was little oviposition on the cage in our bioassays, which indicates that moths primarily chose between plants in our setup, but differs from the strong preference found by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Sobhy et al., (2022)</xref> of FAW moths to oviposit directly on the mesh of a bioassay cage rather than on the plants when offered maize co-planted with <italic>D. intortum</italic>. <italic>Desmodium</italic> and maize plants were planted in the same pots by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Sobhy et al., (2022)</xref>, and therefore maize volatiles may have been affected by belowground interactions or through priming by <italic>Desmodium</italic> volatiles prior to or during oviposition bioassays. This is in fact closer to the configuration in push-pull fields, but does not isolate the influence of the <italic>Desmodium</italic> headspace, as we sought to do here.</p>
<p>In our bioassays, no significant effect could be seen in the treatments where moths had only indirect contact with <italic>Desmodium</italic> volatiles coming from a <italic>Desmodium</italic> plant proximate to one maize plant, but outside of the cage. This is not consistent with the hypothesis that <italic>Desmodium</italic> volatiles repel FAW moths as proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Pickett et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Sobhy et al., 2022</xref>). It is possible that the distance of about 60 cm between the plants in the cages was not suitable to create a gradient of volatiles sufficient to allow moths to choose between maize plants closer to versus further from <italic>Desmodium</italic>, in which case neighboring treatments with distances of 50 – 100 cm could have also affected each other. To our knowledge, the only comparable setup was reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Erdei et al., (2024)</xref>, in which two maize plants were exposed to volatiles of either <italic>D. intortum</italic> or an artificial plant in a modified wind tunnel, and moths did not show a significant preference for either maize plant.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we found a preference of FAW for maize over <italic>D. intortum</italic> and <italic>D. incanum</italic>, but this preference could not be solely attributed to <italic>Desmodium</italic> volatiles in our experiments. It is not to be expected that herbivores use all potential host plants equally, and preferences among host plants or for host over non-host plants can be based on different plant traits. FAW moths may also prefer maize over <italic>Desmodium</italic> due to other traits such as the surface texture, as proposed in the findings from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Erdei et al., (2024)</xref> that silicate trichomes on <italic>D. intortum</italic> pose a danger to FAW larvae; or chemical repellents directly on the leaf surface. Belowground interactions or priming between <italic>Desmodium</italic> and maize plants co-planted in push-pull fields may also change moths’ preference for maize, an effect which could not have been observed with our experimental design, but might explain inconsistencies between our findings and those from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Erdei et al., (2024)</xref> versus those from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Sobhy et al., (2022)</xref>.</p>

<title>Wind Tunnel Bioassay</title>
<p>The short-term flight behavior of FAW moths was tested in a two-choice wind tunnel setup where volatiles of a maize plant vs. maize + <italic>Desmodium</italic> were compared against each other. Flight behavior showed large variation among the individual moths, but three-quarters of the moths had settled after at least three minutes or showed fewer than three segment changes in the last two minutes of the experiment. This experimental setup has limited space and duration, and moths may behave differently over longer times or when given more space to maneuver, as under normal field conditions. Furthermore, the quarter of the moths that showed high activity indicate the difficulty of quantifying the responses of such active fliers. Interestingly, a larger proportion of moths settled after 2 minutes when presented with maize versus maize + <italic>D. intortum</italic>, rather than continuing to fly. The moths showed a weak preference for the volatiles of the single maize plant over the volatiles of maize + <italic>D. intortum</italic>, whereby they slightly preferred volatiles from <italic>D. incanum</italic> + maize over maize alone but did not distinguish between volatiles from two maize plants (negative control). However, none of the treatments showed any significant preference. In contrast, repulsion of moths by <italic>D. intortum</italic> volatiles with or without the addition of maize was observed in no-choice assays when the total distance flown upwind at the end of the experiment was used as a metric (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Sobhy et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Peter et al., 2023</xref>). Based on these wind tunnel results, it cannot be excluded that the exchange of <italic>D. intortum</italic> with <italic>D. incanum</italic> in third-generation push-pull fields may reduce protection against FAW moths. However, in direct oviposition choice assays (in which moths were enclosed in a cage with one maize and one <italic>Desmodium</italic> plant), maize was preferred equally over either <italic>Desmodium</italic> species.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Several field studies have described positive effects of push-pull systems with the companion crops <italic>D. intortum</italic> or <italic>D. incanum</italic> on maize yield (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Midega et al., 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Cheruiyot et al., 2021</xref>). Here, we show that 17 - 19 volatile substances that have been previously shown to affect pest host choice were found in the headspaces of both companion crops <italic>D. intortum</italic> and <italic>D. incanum</italic> within the activity window of FAW moths. However, we did not observe a clear repellent effect of <italic>Desmodium</italic> volatiles on the FAW in our bioassays. FAW moths clearly preferred to oviposit on maize over <italic>D. intortum</italic> or <italic>D. incanum</italic> plants. Our results thus indicate that moths prefer maize over <italic>Desmodium</italic> and that this may be influenced by short-range mechanisms such as an unfavorable leaf surface of <italic>Desmodium</italic>. However, the main interest in the context of push-pull is how <italic>Desmodium</italic> contributes to protecting co-planted maize. A reduction of FAW damage on maize under push-pull cultivation has been demonstrated in multiple studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Midega et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Hailu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Cheruiyot et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Yeboah et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Mutyambai et al., 2022</xref>). Based on the literature, the pull effect of border crop volatiles may be important for reducing FAW damage in push-pull fields, in combination with the attraction of parasitoids by <italic>Desmodium</italic> volatiles and unfavorable host qualities of <italic>Desmodium</italic> plants for FAW (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). Furthermore, the <italic>Desmodium</italic> intercrop may be equally or more important for weed suppression, soil fertility, and possibly improving maize plant health and rigor as for volatile-mediated repellence of FAW in the push-pull system.</p>

<title>Methods and materials</title>
<p>All volatile sampling and bioassays were performed with two <italic>Desmodium</italic> species, <italic>Desmodium intortum</italic> (greenleaf <italic>Desmodium</italic>) and <italic>Desmodium incanum</italic> (often referred to as African <italic>Desmodium</italic> by the push-pull farmers) and in the method section referred to as <italic>Desmodium</italic> for simplicity. All raw data and code used for the statistical analysis can be found on Zenodo (CERN, Geneva, Switzerland, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.11633890">https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.11633890</ext-link>) and Github (github.com/ DariaMOdermatt/DesmodiumVolatilesinPush-Pull).</p>

<title>Pretest Moth Activity Window</title>
<p>The determination of the activity window of the FAW was relevant for the choice of the duration of the volatile sampling. The FAW is reported to be nocturnal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Sparks, 1979</xref>), without report of a more precise activity window. For the first cycle, two single maize leaves of the landrace ‘Jowi white’ were placed in wooden cages with meshed side walls (100 x 60 x 60 cm) in high cylindrical glasses filled with water, but sealed with a piece of cotton to prevent moths of entering the glasses. Moths of the age of 3 - 4 days were released in pairs of one female and one male in 10 different cages (resulting in 20 moths in total) and observed from 7pm - 11.30pm in two consecutive nights. The moths were recollected in falcon tubes in the morning after the first night, sealed with a piece of cotton to allow air circulation and stored at a temperature of approx. 25 °C until they were released in the same combinations on the following evening. For the second night fresh maize leaves were provided for the moths to oviposit. For the second cycle, potted maize plants with multiple leaves of the landrace ‘Jowi white’ were placed inside the wooden cages with a piece of cotton soaked with water. Three female and two male moths of different ages were placed each in three cages (resulting in 15 moths in total) and observed between 6pm - 1am in two consecutive nights. During day time the moths and the plant were left unaltered in the cage.</p>

<title>Volatile Sampling</title>
<p>Volatiles of <italic>Desmodium</italic> were collected from plants in push-pull fields of local smallholder farmers near Mbita in the counties Homa bay and Siaya (coordinates determined with WGS84 coordinate system (latitude, longitude): <italic>D. incanum</italic> = (-0.382096, 34.175487), (-0.4298279, 34.207891), (0.189957, 34.36072), <italic>D. intortum</italic> = (-0.382096, 34.175487), (-0.6302736, 34.494595), (-0.551479, 34.314673)). <italic>Desmodium</italic> volatiles were collected on three different push-pull fields in May and June 2023 during the long rains, selecting four representative plants per field. As it is becoming more common, some of the push-pull fields were mixed with vegetables such as kale or cowpeas. Volatile collections were also performed from potted <italic>Desmodium</italic> plants, as well as from healthy and infested potted maize plants on the research campus. Five three-week-old maize plants, later labeled as“infested”, were exposed in two cages, each with each three female and two male moths, for two nights prior to the volatile sampling, which resulted in 1 to 10 batches per plant. Potted plants were placed in a greenhouse with a glass roof and two glass walls, in which air was able to circulate through netted walls on the opposing longer walls of the greenhouse.</p>
<p>As an adsorbent, commercially available Tenax TA glass tubes (containing 150 mg adsorbent, 35 – 60 mesh, Markes International Ltd, England or 186 mg adsorbent, 60 – 80 mesh, Merck, Germany) were used. A handful of leaves were enclosed in a preheated roasting bag (Sainsbury’s, London, UK). The inlet tubing pushed 500 mL/min charcoal-filtered air into the bags from the lower bag rim, while the Tenax TA tube was connected to an air outlet tubing through a small hole at the top of the bag. Air flows were regulated by PYE Volatile Collection Kits (B. J. Pye, Kings Walden, UK) as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Steen et al. (2019)</xref>. Volatiles were accumulated on the adsorbent by aspirating the air at 200 mL/min (+/- 40 mL/min) for 11.75 h (+/- 30 min) overnight from 7 pm until 6.45 am of the following day. Under the same conditions, four ambient controls were sampled with an empty roasting bag on two fields with each <italic>Desmodium</italic> species. Additionally, a Tenax TA storage control was stored with all tubes, but never taken to the fields.</p>

<sec id="s5c">
<title>TD-GC-MS Measurement</title>
<p>All samples were measured on a TD-GC-MS instrument (Thermal Desorption – Gas Chromatography – Mass Spectrometer) from Shimadzu (TD30-QP2020NX Kyoto, Japan). The Tenax TA tubes were desorbed for 15 min at 220 °C under 80 mL/min nitrogen flow. Volatiles were trapped on a Tenax cooling trap at -20 °C and after desorption was completed, the cooling trap was heated rapidly to 230 °C. The sample was injected with a split ratio of 1:5 and separated on a Rtx-Wax column (30 m, 0.25 mmID, 0.25 μm, Restek Corporation, USA) with the following 35 min oven program: holding at 40 °C for 2 min, heating to 150 °C with 10 °C/min, holding at 150 °C for 2 min, heating to 190 °C with 3 °C/min, heating to 230 °C with 10 °C/min and holding at 230 °C for 3 min. Mass fragments from 33 m/z to 400 m/z resulting from electron ionization at 70 eV were recorded with a scan rate of 5 Hz at an ion source temperature of 230 °C from 3 – 30 min.</p>

<title>Feature Detection</title>
<p>A feature list was generated in MZmine (Version 3.9.0, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Schmid et al., 2023</xref>)) from all compounds that occurred in at least one-third of the field samples of either <italic>Desmodium</italic> species and in less than 4/5 of the combined control samples (ambient control and storage control). Features were numbered and considered as unidentified if there was no corresponding reference compound. After removal of contaminants, the features were added to an existing target list that was composed with commercially available plant volatiles that can be mainly classified as terpenoids and benzenoids, which as a whole contain a large variety of functional groups such as alcohols, aldehydes, ketones and esters. Additionally, the existing list included four green leaf volatiles ((<italic>E</italic>)-2-hexen-1-ol acetate, (<italic>E</italic>)-2-hexenal, (<italic>Z</italic>)-3-hexen-1-ol, (<italic>Z</italic>)-3-hexen-1-ol acetate) and a selection of more specific substances reported in push-pull fields such as (<italic>E</italic>)-4,8–dimethyl–1,3,7-nonatriene (DMNT) and (<italic>E</italic>,<italic>E</italic>)-4,8,12-trimethyl-1,3,7,11-tridecatetraene (TMTT). Integration of all substances and features was manually checked for the all control samples (ambient and storage control) using the LabSolutions Insight GCMS software (Shimadzu corporation, Kyoto, Japan). Peaks for all targets that occurred in at least 1/2 of the <italic>Desmodium</italic> field samples and in no more than 3/5 of controls were manually checked for all samples. Eventually, all targets that occured in at least 2/3 of the field samples of <italic>D. intortum</italic> or <italic>D. incanum</italic> and in no more than 3/5 of the controls were considered as present. In <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> the electron impact ionization (EI)-MS data of the unidentified features are displayed, and in <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> the origin of all reference standards used to identify the target hits can be found.</p>

<title>Fall Armyworm Moths</title>
<p>To form the FAW colony, wild individuals were collected in the counties Siaya, Kisumu, Migori, and Vihiga in Western Kenya. Larvae were fed on artificial diet based on soy flour, wheat germ, raw linseed oil, mineral mix, sugar, aureomycin, vitamins, agar, methyl parabene, sorbic acid, and calcium propionate (Article No 870-265-3747, Southland Products Inc, Lake Village AR, USA). Moths were fed on water and in rare cases after emergence on 10% honey solution. The colony was occasionally restocked with wild FAW moths. Each day after hatching, moths of both sexes were transferred to a cage to allow mating until the start of the experiment.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s5g">
<title>Experimental Procedure</title>
<p>Cages (100 x 60 x 60 cm) lined with wooden floors and ceilings and netted walls were placed in greenhouses that allowed air circulation through mesh side walls (for pictures of the real setup, see <xref rid="fig4-2" ref-type="fig">Figure 4—figure Supplement 2</xref>, for exact positioning in the greenhouses, see <xref rid="fig4-3" ref-type="fig">Figure 4—figure Supplement 3</xref> and <xref rid="fig4-4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4—figure Supplement 4</xref>). Two plants were placed within the cage at the greatest distance possible (approx. 60 cm) in two opposite corners. For the control treatment, two maize plants were placed in the cage, while the direct <italic>Desmodium</italic> treatment consisted of one maize plant and one <italic>Desmodium</italic> plant in the cage. In two additional treatments with indirect contact, two maize plants were placed in the cage, while one <italic>Desmodium</italic> plant was placed outside the cage unreachable for the FAW moths, but in proximity to one maize plant. Three female and two male moths at the age of 4 – 5 days were released approx. 1 h before dusk and allowed to oviposit under natural conditions of L12:D12 for three consecutive nights. Eggs were collected in five different groups depending on the position in which they were laid, either on one of the two plants, close to one of the plants within a maximum of 20 cm distance, or on the cage further than 20 cm from any plant (labeled as “No Decision”). Each treatment was repeated 19 – 21 times in total over five cycles, with up to 5 replicates per treatment per cycle.</p>

<title>Egg Count</title>
<p>Each batch of FAW eggs of was collected with sticky tape to separate the layers and spread all eggs out to one dimension. Each egg batch was taped to white paper and photographed in a UV imaging system (Syngene, Cambridge, England) against UV light coming from underneath the paper. A script for semiautomatic counts in ImageJ (Version 1.54f, National Institutes of Health, USA) was developed and used for counting the exact number of eggs per picture (see <xref rid="fig4-5" ref-type="fig">Figure 4—figure Supplement 5</xref>).

Maize plants (SC Duma 43, Seed Co Limited, Nairobi, Kenya) were used at the age of 4 – 7 weeks with five to eight fullygrown leaves. It was observed that maize plants seemed to grow more slowly in Nairobi than in Mbita, which could be explained by the generally lower temperatures in Nairobi. <italic>D. intortum</italic> and <italic>D. incanum</italic> seeds were obtained from a push-pull field on the icipe campus Mbita and were 6 – 8 weeks and 7 months old when used, respectively.</p>

<title>Fall Armyworm Moths</title>
<p>To form the FAW colony, wild individuals were collected in Central Kenya such as in the counties Kiambu, Muranga, and Embu and restocked with wild individuals every three months. Larvae were reared on maize leaves, while moths were only fed with water. The colony was occasionally restocked with wild FAW moths. Each day after hatching, moths of both sexes were transferred to a cage to allow mating until the start of the experiment. At least 2 h prior to the experiment, female moths were separated from males and and placed in the darkened experimental room for adjustment to temperature and humidity.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s5i3">
<title>Experimental Procedure</title>
<p>The five upper leaves of a maize plant were wrapped in a preheated roasting bag (Sainsbury’s, London, UK) with the addition of approximately the same biomass of <italic>Desmodium</italic> on one side of a two-choice wind tunnel (100 x 30 x 30 cm) and compared to a single maize plant wrapped in the same manner on the other side. Control treatments were conducted with one maize plant wrapped in this way on each side. Air was pushed through activated charcoal filters and into the roasting bag from the lower rim of the bag at a rate of 740 – 820 mL/min and a Teflon tube conveyed the plant volatiles from the top of the roasting bag to one side of the wind tunnel. Inside the wind tunnel, the air was pumped out from the center at the 0 cm mark resulting in an air stream at the air transfer tubing of 480 – 570 mL/min with no greater difference than 4 mL/min between the two sides. One female moth at an age of 4 – 5 days was released through a hole in the center at 0 cm and its flight behavior was observed for 5 minutes. The wind tunnel was separated into 5 sectors of 20 cm each, and a time stamp was set every time the moth changed the segment (See <xref rid="fig5-1" ref-type="fig">Figure 5—figure Supplement 1</xref>). All experiments were conducted between 7 pm and 1:30 am under red light. Each trial was recorded on video using a mobile phone camera (Fairphone 4, 48 MP), which captured the wind tunnel from a front view. The videos were rewatched for the data acquisition and in cases where moths were barely visible, complemented with the notes from the live observation. To simplify the data analysis, the two left sectors (50 – 30 cm left &amp; 30 – 10 cm left) were combined, as were the two right sectors (10 – 30 cm right, 30 – 50 cm right).</p>

<sec id="s5j">
<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>All statistical analysis was performed in RStudio (R version 4.3.2, RStudio version 2024.04.2). Mixed models were performed to determine significant effects of the positions of FAW eggs in the oviposition bioassays or for the duration of stay in the different sectors in the wind tunnel bioassays. In both bioassays a control with two maize plants was performed. Therefore, the control replications were included twice in the dataset, once with the egg count data or the duration of stay of both sides interchanged. In addition, the replication was included as a random effect into the model equations. For the oviposition bioassay, the egg counts on the maize or the <italic>Desmodium</italic> plant were compared amongst all treatments, with the inclusion of the greenhouse, the cage (combination of the cage group and the cage number), the start date and the replication number as random effects. For the wind tunnel bioassay, the duration of stay closer to the maize or the <italic>Desmodium</italic> plants were compared amongst all treatments, with the inclusion of the start date and the replication number as random effects.</p>

<label>Appendix 1</label><title>Pretests: Moth Activity Window</title>
<p>Pretests were carried out to determine the activity window of the FAW moths, as it was important for deciding the time window of the headspace sampling of volatiles that are relevant for the FAW moths. The FAW moth is reported to be nocturnal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Sparks, 1979</xref>) and was checked regularly from dusk until around midnight. In the first hours only little activity was observed, while toward midnight more flight and mating activity was observed. As a result, the moth activity could not be limited to the few hours of the evening and volatile sampling was proceeded from 7pm - 6.45am covering all dark hours.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The manuscript of Odermatt et al. investigates the volatiles released by two species of Desmodium plants and the response of herbivores to maize plants alone or in combination with these species. The results show that Desmodium releases volatiles in both the laboratory and the field. Maize grown in the laboratory also released volatiles, in a similar range. While female moths preferred to oviposit on maize, the authors found no evidence that Desmodium volatiles played a role in lowering attraction to or oviposition on maize.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The manuscript is a response to recently published papers that presented conflicting results with respect to whether Desmodium releases volatiles constitutively or in response to biotic stress, the level at which such volatiles are released, and the behavioral effect it has on the fall armyworm. These questions are relevant as Desmodium is used in a textbook example of pest-suppressive sustainable intercropping technology called push-pull, which has supported tens of thousands of smallholder farmers in suppressing moth pests in maize. A large number of research papers over more than two decades have implied that Desmodium suppresses herbivores in push-pull intercropping through the release of large amounts of volatiles that repel herbivores. This premise has been questioned in recent papers. Odermatt et al. thus contribute to this discussion by testing the role of odors in oviposition choice. The paper confirms that ovipositing FAW preferred maize, and also confirmed that odors released from Desmodium appeared not important in their bioassays.</p>
<p>The paper is a welcome addition to the literature and adds quality headspace analyses of Desmodium from the laboratory and the field. Furthermore, the authors, some of whom have since long contributed to developing push-pull, also find that Desmodium odors are not significant in their choice between maize plants. This advances our knowledge of the mechanisms through which push-pull suppresses herbivores, which is critically important to evolving the technique to fit different farming systems and translating this mechanism to fit with other crops and in other geographical areas.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Below I outline the major concerns:</p>
<p>(1) Clear induction of the experimental plants, and lack of reflective discussion around this: from literature data and previous studies of maize and Desmodium, it is clear that the plants used in this study, particularly the Desmodium, were induced. Maize appeared to be primarily manually damaged, possibly due to sampling (release of GLV, but little to no terpenoids, which is indicative of mostly physical stress and damage, for example, one of the coauthor's own paper Tamiru et al. 2011), whereas Desmodium releases a blend of many compounds (many terpenoids indicative of herbivore induction). Erdei et al. also clearly show that under controlled conditions maize, silver leaf and green leaf Desmodium release volatiles in very low amounts. While the condition of the plants in Odermatt et al. may be reflective of situations in push-pull fields, the authors should elaborate on the above in the discussion (see comments) such that the readers understand that the plant's condition during the experiments. This is particularly important because it has been assumed that Desmodium releases typical herbivore-induced volatiles constitutively, which is not the case (see Erdei et al. 2024). This reflection is currently lacking in the manuscript.</p>
<p>(2) Lack of controls that would have provided context to the data: The experiments lack important controls that would have helped in the interpretation:</p>
<p>(2a) The authors did not control the conditions of the plants. To understand the release of volatiles and their importance in the field, the authors should have included controlled herbivory in both maize and Desmodium. This would have placed the current volatile profiles in a herbivory context. Now the volatile measurements hang in midair, leading to discussions that are not well anchored (and should be rephrased thoroughly, see eg lines 183-188). It is well known that maize releases only very low levels of volatiles without abiotic and biotic stressors. However, this changes upon stress (GLVs by direct, physical damage and eg terpenoids upon herbivory, see above). Erdei et al. confirm this pattern in Desmodium. Not having these controls, means that the authors need to put the data in the context of what has been published (see above).</p>
<p>(2b) It would also have been better if the authors had sampled maize from the field while sampling Desmodium. Together with the above point (inclusion of herbivore-induced maize and Desmodium), the levels of volatile release by Desmodium would have been placed into context.</p>
<p>(2c) To put the volatiles release in the context of push-pull, it would have been important to sample other plants which are frequently used as intercrop by smallholder farmers, but which are not considered effective as push crops, particularly edible legumes. Sampling the headspace of these plants, both 'clean' and herbivore-induced, would have provided a context to the volatiles that Desmodium (induced) releases in the field - one would expect unsuccessful push crops to not release any of these 'bioactive' volatiles (although 'bioactive' should be avoided) if these odors are responsible for the pest suppressive effect of Desmodium. Many edible intercrops have been tested to increase the adoption of push-pull technology but with little success.</p>
<p>Because of the lack of the above, the conclusions the authors can draw from their data are weakened. The data are still valuable in the current discussion around push-pull, provided that a proper context is given in the discussion along the points above.</p>
<p>(3) 'Tendency' of the authors to accept the odor hypothesis (i.e. that Desmodium odors are responsible for repelling FAW and thereby reduce infestation in maize under push-pull management) in spite of their own data: The authors tested the effects of odor in oviposition choice, both in a cage assay and in a 'wind tunnel'. From the cage experiments, it is clear that FAW preferred maize over Desmodium, confirming other reports (including Erdei et al. 2024). However, when choosing between two maize plants, one of which was placed next to Desmodium to which FAW has no tactile (taste, structure, etc), FAW chose equally. Similarly in their wind tunnel setup (this term should not be used to describe the assay, see below), no preference was found either between maize odor in the presence or absence of Desmodium. This too confirms results obtained by Erdei et al. (but add an important element to it by using Desmodium plants that had been induced and released volatiles, contrary to Erdei et al. 2024). Even though no support was found for repellency by Desmodium odors, the authors in many instances in the manuscript (lines 30-33, 164-169, 202, 279, 284, 304-307, 311-312, 320) appear to elevate non-significant tendencies as being important. This is misleading readers into thinking that these interactions were significant and in fact confirming this in the discussion. The authors should stay true to their own data obtained when testing the hypothesis of whether odors play a role in the pest-suppressive effect of push-pull.</p>
<p>(4) Oviposition bioassay: with so many assays in close proximity, it is hard to certify that the experiments are independent. Please discuss this in the appropriate place in the discussion.</p>
<p>(5) The wind tunnel has a number of issues (besides being poorly detailed):</p>
<p>(5a) The setup which the authors refer to as a 'wind tunnel' does not qualify as a wind tunnel. First, there is no directional flow: there are two flows entering the setup at opposite sides. Second, the flow is way too low for moths to orient in (in a wind tunnel wind should be presented as a directional cue. Only around 1.5 l/min enters the wind tunnel in a volume of 90 l approximately, which does not create any directional flow. Solution: change 'wind tunnel' throughout the text to a dual choice setup /assay.</p>
<p>(5b) There is no control over the flows in the flight section of the setup. It is very well possible that moths at the release point may only sense one of the 'options'. Please discuss this.</p>
<p>(5c) Too low a flow (1,5 l per minute) implies a largely stagnant air, which means cross-contamination between experiments. An experiment takes 5 minutes, but it takes minimally 1.5 hours at these flows to replace the flight chamber air (but in reality much longer as the fresh air does not replace the old air, but mixes with it). The setup does not seem to be equipped with e.g. fans to quickly vent the air out of the setup. See comments in the text. Please discuss the limitations of the experimental setup at the appropriate place in the discussion.</p>
<p>(5d) The stimulus air enters through a tube (what type of tube, diameter, length, etc) containing pressurized air (how was the air obtained into bags (type of bag, how is it sealed?), and the efflux directly into the flight chamber (how, nozzle?). However, it seems that there is no control of the efflux. How was leakage prevented, particularly how the bags were airtight sealed around the plants?</p>
<p>(5e) The plants were bagged in very narrowly fitting bags. The maize plants look bent and damaged, which probably explains the GLVs found in the samples. The Desmodium in the picture (Figure 5 supplement), which we should assume is at least a representative picture?) appears to be rather crammed into the bag with maize and looks in rather poor condition to start with (perhaps also indicating why they release these volatiles?). It would be good to describe the sampling of the plants in detail and explain that the way they were handled may have caused the release of GLVs.</p>
<p>(6) Figure 1 seems redundant as a main figure in the text. Much of the information is not pertinent to the paper. It can be used in a review on the topic. Or perhaps if the authors strongly wish to keep it, it could be placed in the supplemental material.</p>

<p>Based on the controversy of whether the Desmodium intercrop emits bioactive volatiles that repel the fall armyworm, the authors conducted this study to assess the effects of the volatiles from Desmodium plants in the push-pull system on behavior of FAW oviposition. This topic is interesting and the results are valuable for understanding the push-pull system for the management of FAW, the serious pest. The methodology used in this study is valid, leading to reliable results and conclusions. I just have a few concerns and suggestions for improvement of this paper:</p>
<p>(1) The volatiles emitted from D. incanum were analyzed and their effects on the oviposition behavior of FAW moth were confirmed. However, it would be better and useful to identify the specific compounds that are crucial for the success of the push-pull system.</p>
<p>(2) That would be good to add &quot;symbols&quot; of significance in Figure 4 (D).</p>
<p>(3) Figure A is difficult for readers to understand.</p>
<p>(4) It will be good to deeply discuss the functions of important volatile compounds identified here with comparison with results in previous studies in the discussion better.</p>

<p>We thank both reviewers for their thorough and insightful feedback, which will contribute to improving our manuscript. In summary, the key concerns raised include the potential induction of GLV volatiles due to plant handling, limitations in the design of the &quot;wind tunnel&quot; bioassay, and the need for a deeper analysis of specific volatile compounds that contribute to the success of push-pull systems. We are happy to revise the entire manuscript according to all comments of the reviewers. This includes clarification of our methodology and providing a more reflective discussion on how physical stress might have influenced volatile emissions. Additionally, we will conduct new experiments with a modified bioassay setup to address concerns about directional cues and airflow control, minimizing cross-contamination. While the identification of individual compounds was beyond the scope of this study, we acknowledge its importance and propose it as a direction for future research.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>We acknowledge the need for a more reflective discussion on the possible causes of GLV (green leaf volatiles) emission, particularly regarding physical damage. Although the field plants were carefully handled, it is possible that some physical stress may have contributed to the release of GLVs. We will ensure the revised manuscript reflects this nuanced interpretation. However, we will also explain more clearly that our aim was to capture the volatile emission of plants used by farmers under realistic conditions and moth responses to these plants, not to be able to attribute the volatile emission to a specific cause. We think that this is also clear in the manuscript. However, we plan to revise relevant passages throughout the manuscript to ensure that we do not make any claims about the reason for volatile emissions, and that our claims regarding these plants and their headspace being representative of the system as practiced by farmers are supported. In the revised manuscript we will explain better that the volatile profiles comprise a majority of non-GLV compounds. As shown in figure 1, the majority of the substances that were found in the headspace of the sampled plants of Desmodium intortum or Desmodium incanum are non-GLV monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes, or aromatic compounds. We will also note that the experimental plants used in the study were grown in insect proof screenhouses and were checked for any insect damage before volatile collection and bioassay.</p>

<p>(2) Lack of controls that would have provided context to the data: The experiments lack important controls that would have helped in the interpretation:</p>
<p>(2a) The authors did not control the conditions of the plants. To understand the release of volatiles and their importance in the field, the authors should have included controlled herbivory in both maize and Desmodium. This would have placed the current volatile profiles in a herbivory context. Now the volatile measurements hang in midair, leading to discussions that are not well anchored (and should be rephrased thoroughly, see eg lines 183-188). It is well known that maize releases only very low levels of volatiles without abiotic and biotic stressors. However, this changes upon stress (GLVs by direct, physical damage and eg terpenoids upon herbivory, see above). Erdei et al. confirm this pattern in Desmodium. Not having these controls, means that the authors need to put the data in the context of what has been published (see above).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate this concern. Our study aimed to capture the real-world conditions of push-pull fields, where Desmodium and maize grow in natural environments without the direct induction of herbivory for experimental purposes. We will update the discussion to provide better context based on existing literature regarding the volatile release under stress conditions. We agree that in further studies it would be important to carry out experiments under different environmental conditions, including herbivore damage. However, this was not within the scope of the present study.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2b) It would also have been better if the authors had sampled maize from the field while sampling Desmodium. Together with the above point (inclusion of herbivore-induced maize and Desmodium), the levels of volatile release by Desmodium would have been placed into context.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We acknowledge that sampling maize and other intercrop plants, such as edible legumes, alongside Desmodium in the push-pull field would have allowed us to make direct comparisons of the volatile profiles of different plants in the push-pull system under shared field conditions. Again, this should be done in future experiments but was beyond the scope of the present study. Due to the amount of samples, we could handle given cost and workload, we chose to focus on Desmodium because there is much less literature on the volatile profiles of field-grown Desmodium than maize plants in the field: we are aware of one study attempting to measure field volatile profiles from Desmodium intortum (Erdei et al. 2024) and no study attempting this for Desmodium incanum. We will point out this justification for our focus on Desmodium in the manuscript. Additionally, we will suggest in the discussion that future studies should measure volatile profiles from maize and intercrop legumes alongside Desmodium and border grass in push-pull fields.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2c) To put the volatiles release in the context of push-pull, it would have been important to sample other plants which are frequently used as intercrop by smallholder farmers, but which are not considered effective as push crops, particularly edible legumes. Sampling the headspace of these plants, both 'clean' and herbivore-induced, would have provided a context to the volatiles that Desmodium (induced) releases in the field - one would expect unsuccessful push crops to not release any of these 'bioactive' volatiles (although 'bioactive' should be avoided) if these odors are responsible for the pest suppressive effect of Desmodium. Many edible intercrops have been tested to increase the adoption of push-pull technology but with little success.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Again, we very much agree that such measurements are important for the longer-term research program in this field. But again, for the current study this would have exploded the size of the required experiment. Regarding bioactivity, we have been careful to use the phrase &quot;potentially bioactive&quot;, or to cite other studies showing bioactivity, where we have not demonstrated bioactivity ourselves.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Because of the lack of the above, the conclusions the authors can draw from their data are weakened. The data are still valuable in the current discussion around push-pull, provided that a proper context is given in the discussion along the points above.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree that our study is limited to its specific aims. Therefore, we think the revisions will make these more explicit and help to avoid misleading claims.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) 'Tendency' of the authors to accept the odor hypothesis (i.e. that Desmodium odors are responsible for repelling FAW and thereby reduce infestation in maize under push-pull management) in spite of their own data: The authors tested the effects of odor in oviposition choice, both in a cage assay and in a 'wind tunnel'. From the cage experiments, it is clear that FAW preferred maize over Desmodium, confirming other reports (including Erdei et al. 2024). However, when choosing between two maize plants, one of which was placed next to Desmodium to which FAW has no tactile (taste, structure, etc), FAW chose equally. Similarly in their wind tunnel setup (this term should not be used to describe the assay, see below), no preference was found either between maize odor in the presence or absence of Desmodium. This too confirms results obtained by Erdei et al. (but add an important element to it by using Desmodium plants that had been induced and released volatiles, contrary to Erdei et al. 2024). Even though no support was found for repellency by Desmodium odors, the authors in many instances in the manuscript (lines 30-33, 164-169, 202, 279, 284, 304-307, 311-312, 320) appear to elevate non-significant tendencies as being important. This is misleading readers into thinking that these interactions were significant and in fact confirming this in the discussion. The authors should stay true to their own data obtained when testing the hypothesis of whether odors play a role in the pest-suppressive effect of push-pull.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate this feedback and agree that we may have overstated claims that could not be supported by strict significance tests. However, we believe that non-significant tendencies can still provide valuable insights. In the revised version of the manuscript, we will ensure a clear distinction between statistically significant findings and non-significant trends and remove any language that may imply stronger support for the odor hypothesis that what the data show.</p>

<p>(4) Oviposition bioassay: with so many assays in close proximity, it is hard to certify that the experiments are independent. Please discuss this in the appropriate place in the discussion.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have pointed this out in the submitted manuscript in the lines 275 – 279. Furthermore, we include detailed captions to figure 4 - supporting figure 3 &amp; figure 4 - supporting figure 4. We are aware that in all such experiments there is a danger of between-treatment interference, which we will point out for our specific case. We will also mention that this common caveat does not invalidate experimental designs when practicing replication and randomization and assume insect’s ability to select suitable oviposition site in the background of such confounding factors under realistic conditions. We will also mention explicitly that with our experimental setup we tried to minimize interference between treatments by spacing and temporal staggering.</p>

<p>(5) The wind tunnel has a number of issues (besides being poorly detailed):</p>
<p>(5a) The setup which the authors refer to as a 'wind tunnel' does not qualify as a wind tunnel. First, there is no directional flow: there are two flows entering the setup at opposite sides. Second, the flow is way too low for moths to orient in (in a wind tunnel wind should be presented as a directional cue. Only around 1.5 l/min enters the wind tunnel in a volume of 90 l approximately, which does not create any directional flow. Solution: change 'wind tunnel' throughout the text to a dual choice setup /assay.)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with these criticisms and will change the terminology accordingly. We also plan to conduct an additional experiment with a no-choice arena that provides conditions closer to a true wind tunnel. The setup of the added experiment features an odor entry point at only one side of the chamber to create a more directional airflow. Each treatment (maize alone, maize + D. intortum, maize + D. incanum, and a control with no plants) will be tested separately, with only one treatment conducted per evening to avoid cross-contamination.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5b) There is no control over the flows in the flight section of the setup. It is very well possible that moths at the release point may only sense one of the 'options'. Please discuss this.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We will add this to the discussion. The newly planned assays also address this concern by using a setup with laminar flow.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5c) Too low a flow (1,5 l per minute) implies a largely stagnant air, which means cross-contamination between experiments. An experiment takes 5 minutes, but it takes minimally 1.5 hours at these flows to replace the flight chamber air (but in reality much longer as the fresh air does not replace the old air, but mixes with it). The setup does not seem to be equipped with e.g. fans to quickly vent the air out of the setup. See comments in the text. Please discuss the limitations of the experimental setup at the appropriate place in the discussion.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We will add these limitations to the discussion and will address these concerns with new experiments (see answer 5a).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5d) The stimulus air enters through a tube (what type of tube, diameter, length, etc) containing pressurized air (how was the air obtained into bags (type of bag, how is it sealed?), and the efflux directly into the flight chamber (how, nozzle?). However, it seems that there is no control of the efflux. How was leakage prevented, particularly how the bags were airtight sealed around the plants?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We will add the missing information to the methods and provide details about types of bags, manufacturers, and pre-treatments. In short, Teflon tubes connected bagged plants to the bioassay setup and air was pumped in at an overpressure, so leakage was not eliminated but contamination from ambient air was avoided.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5e) The plants were bagged in very narrowly fitting bags. The maize plants look bent and damaged, which probably explains the GLVs found in the samples. The Desmodium in the picture (Figure 5 supplement), which we should assume is at least a representative picture?) appears to be rather crammed into the bag with maize and looks in rather poor condition to start with (perhaps also indicating why they release these volatiles?). It would be good to describe the sampling of the plants in detail and explain that the way they were handled may have caused the release of GLVs.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We will include a more detailed description of the plant handling and bagging processes to the methods to clarify how the plants were treated during all assays reported in the submitted manuscript and the newly planned assays. This will address concerns about the possible influence of plant stress, such as GLV emission due to bagging, on the results. We politely disagree that the maize plants were damaged and the Desmodium plants not representative of those encountered in the field. The Desmodium plant pictured was D. incanum, which has sparser foliage and smaller leaves than D. intortum.</p>

<p>(6) Figure 1 seems redundant as a main figure in the text. Much of the information is not pertinent to the paper. It can be used in a review on the topic. Or perhaps if the authors strongly wish to keep it, it could be placed in the supplemental material.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We think that Figure 1 provides essential information about the push-pull system and the FAW. To our knowledge, this partly contradictory evidence so far has not been synthesized in the literature. We realize that such a figure would more commonly be provided in a review article, but we do not think that the small number of studies on this topic so far justify a stand-alone review. Instead, the introduction to our manuscript includes a brief review of these few studies, complemented by the visual summary provided in Figure 1 and a detailed supplementary table. We will revise the figure and associated text in the introduction to highlight its relevance for the current study and to reduce redundant information.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>Based on the controversy of whether the Desmodium intercrop emits bioactive volatiles that repel the fall armyworm, the authors conducted this study to assess the effects of the volatiles from Desmodium plants in the push-pull system on behavior of FAW oviposition. This topic is interesting and the results are valuable for understanding the push-pull system for the management of FAW, the serious pest. The methodology used in this study is valid, leading to reliable results and conclusions. I just have a few concerns and suggestions for improvement of this paper:</p>
<p>(1) The volatiles emitted from D. incanum were analyzed and their effects on the oviposition behavior of FAW moth were confirmed. However, it would be better and useful to identify the specific compounds that are crucial for the success of the push-pull system.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We fully agree that identifying specific volatile compounds responsible for the push-pull effect would provide valuable insights into the underlying mechanisms of the system. However, the primary focus of this study was to address the still unresolved question whether Desmodium emits volatiles at all under field conditions, and the secondary aim was to test whether we could demonstrate a behavioral effect of Desmodium headspace on FAW moths. Before conducting our experiments, we carefully considered the option of using single volatile compounds and synthetic blends in bioassays. We decided against this because we judged that the contradictory evidence in the literature was not a sufficient basis for composing representative blends. Furthermore, we think it is an important first step to test for behavioral responses to the headspaces of real plants. We consider bioassays with pure compounds to be important for confirmation and more detailed investigation in future studies. There was also contradictory evidence in the literature regarding moth responses to plants. We thus opted to focus on experiments with whole plants to maintain ecological relevance.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) That would be good to add &quot;symbols&quot; of significance in Figure 4 (D).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We report the statistical significance of the parameters in Figure 4 (D) in Table 3. While testing significance between groups is a standard approach, we used a more robust model-based analysis to assess the effects of multiple factors simultaneously. We will clarify this in the figure legend and provide a cross-reference to Table 3 for readers to easily find the statistical details.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) Figure A is difficult for readers to understand.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Unfortunately, it is not entirely clear which specific figure is being referred to as &quot;Figure A&quot; in this comment. We kindly request further clarification on which figure needs improvement, and we will make adjustments accordingly to ensure that all figures are easily comprehensible for readers.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) It will be good to deeply discuss the functions of important volatile compounds identified here with comparison with results in previous studies in the discussion better.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Our study does not provide strong evidence that specific volatiles from Desmodium plants are important determinants of FAW oviposition or choice in the push-pull system. Therefore, we prefer to refrain from detailed discussions of the potential importance of individual compounds. However, in the revised version, we will indicate specifically which of the volatiles we identified overlap with those previously reported from Desmodium, as only the total numbers are summarized in the discussion of the submitted paper.</p>
