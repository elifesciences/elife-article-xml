<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Cells prevent heat damage through a highly conserved canonical heat stress response (HSR) in which heat shock factors (HSFs) bind heat shock elements (HSEs) to activate heat shock proteins (HSPs). Plants generate short HSFs that originate from HSF splicing variants, but little is known about S-HSFs. Although an enhanced canonical HSR confers thermotolerance, its hyperactivation inhibits plant growth. How this process is prevented to ensure proper plant growth has not been determined. Here, we report that <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> S-HsfA2, S-HsfA4c, and S-HsfB1 confer extreme heat (45°C) sensitivity and represent new kinds of HSF with a unique truncated DNA-binding domain (tDBD) that binds a new heat-regulated element (HRE). The HRE conferred a minimal promoter response to heat and exhibited heat stress sensing and transmission patterns. We used S-HsfA2 to investigate whether and how S-HSFs prevent hyperactivation of the canonical HSR. <italic>HSP17.6B,</italic> a direct target gene of HsfA2, conferred thermotolerance, but its overexpression caused HSR hyperactivation. We revealed that S-HsfA2 alleviated this hyperactivation in two different ways. 1) S-HsfA2 negatively regulates <italic>HSP17.6B via</italic> the HRE-HRE-like element, thus constructing a noncanonical HSR (S-HsfA2-HRE-<italic>HSP17.6B</italic>) to antagonistically repress HsfA2-activated <italic>HSP17.6B</italic> expression. 2) S-HsfA2 binds to the DBD of HsfA2 to prevent HsfA2 from binding to HSEs, eventually attenuating HsfA2-activated <italic>HSP17.6B</italic> promoter activity. Overall, our findings underscore the biological importance of S-HSFs, namely, preventing plant heat tolerance hyperactivation to maintain proper growth.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Elevated temperatures, <italic>i.e.,</italic> heat shock or heat stress, have become a global problem threatening crop yields (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bita and Gerats, 2013</xref>). Cells prevent heat damage through the canonical heat stress response (HSR). In this canonical HSR, a heat shock factor (HSF) trimer binds a DNA <italic>cis</italic>-acting element called a heat shock element (HSE) to induce the production of heat shock proteins (HSPs). This canonical HSR is highly conserved among different organisms but is highly complex in plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Morimoto, 1993</xref>). Accordingly, heat-tolerant plants are usually generated by overexpressing <italic>HSFs</italic> or <italic>HSPs</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Fragkostefanakis et al., 2015</xref>). Several studies have revealed that enhanced canonical HSR is beneficial for plant heat tolerance but also results in growth inhibition under normal conditions. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Zhu et al. (2009)</xref> reported that overexpression of <italic>Boea hygrometrica Hsf1</italic> in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and tobacco confers plant thermotolerance but also leads to seedling dwarfism under normal conditions. When <italic>Arabidopsis HsfA2</italic> and <italic>HsfA3</italic> are overexpressed, these <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> plants tolerate increased heat stress but exhibit seedling dwarfism under nonstress conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Ogawa et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Yoshida et al., 2008</xref>). These findings reflect the active growth inhibition of canonical HSR hyperactivation under nonstress conditions, which is undesirable for plant productivity. However, much less is known about how plants prevent canonical HSR hyperactivation to ensure a balance between heat resistance and growth. Considering that HSRs are highly complex in plants, we reasoned that there should be new kinds of HSFs that inhibit canonical HSR hyperactivation in plants. However, these new kinds of HSFs and their underlying regulatory mechanisms have yet to be determined in plants.</p>
<p>A common way for introns to expand the diversity of host gene products is alternative splicing (AS). An increasing number of studies have shown that heat stress-induced AS events in heat response genes, including HSFs, are very important regulatory mechanisms for the fitness of plants under heat stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Ling et al., 2021</xref>). Thus, we focused on heat-induced AS events in HSFs as a starting point for revealing new kinds of HSFs and their functions and regulatory mechanisms in the plant response to heat stress.</p>
<p>HSFs share similar constructs across eukaryotes, in which the HSE DNA-binding domain (DBD) is the most conserved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Nover et al., 2001</xref>). The DBD is a “winged” helix-turn-helix protein that consists of three α-helices (H1, H2, H3) and four-stranded antiparallel β-sheets (β1, β2, β3, β4). H3 directly binds to the HSE, and its adjacent wing domain (β3-loop-β4) is needed for the formation of HSF-HSE trimers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Littlefield and Nelson, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Ahn et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Feng et al., 2021</xref>). Interestingly, for all HSFs, the position of an intron within the DBD is conserved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Nover et al., 2001</xref>), and the intron is inserted between H3 and the wing domain coding region. In plants, mostly under heat stress, this intron is fully or partially retained to generate splice variants, such as <italic>Arabidopsis HsfA2-II</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Sugio et al., 2009</xref>), <italic>Arabidopsis HsfA2-III</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Liu et al., 2013</xref>), rice (<italic>Oryza sativa</italic>) <italic>OsHSFA2dII</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Cheng et al., 2015</xref>), lily (<italic>Lilium</italic> spp.) <italic>LlHSFA3B-III</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Wu et al. 2019</xref>), wheat (<italic>Triticum aestivum</italic>) <italic>TaHsfA2-7-AS</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Ma et al., 2023</xref>), and maize (<italic>Zea mays</italic>) <italic>ZmHsf17-II</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Zhang et al., 2024</xref>). These variants contain in-frame stop codons within the retained intron that may translate into short HSF isoforms (S-HSFs).</p>
<p>Several S-HSFs have been proven to play regulatory roles in thermotolerance in plants. Previously, we reported that heat stress-induced S-HsfA2 was detected by immunoblotting and can regulate the expression of <italic>HsfA2</italic> by binding to HSEs within the <italic>HsfA2</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Liu et al., 2013</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Wu et al. (2019)</xref> also reported that LlHSFA3B-III (S-LIHSFA3B) can be detected by immunoblotting and that overexpressing <italic>S-HSFA3B</italic> reduces tolerance to acute heat (45°C) in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> plants. TaHsfA2-7 generates the splice variant TaHsfA2-7-AS (S-TaHsfA2-7), which confers tolerance to heat (45°C) in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Ma et al., 2023</xref>).</p>
<p>S-LIHSFA3B interacts with lily HSFA3A to limit its transactivation function and temper the function of lily HSFA3A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Wu et al., 2019</xref>). S-ZmHsf17 can interact with the DBD of full-length ZmHsf17 to suppress the transactivation of ZmHsf17 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Zhang et al., 2024</xref>). These findings suggest that S-HSFs can regulate the activities of HSFs through S-HSF‒HSF protein interactions. However, how S-HSFs, as transcription factors, regulate plant heat responses remains unclear. Unlike classical HSFs, S-HSFs contain a unique C-terminal truncated DBD (tDBD) and an extended motif or domain encoded by the retained intron sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Liu et al., 2013</xref>). Although S-HSFs lack nuclear localization signals, S-HSFs can also localize to the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Sugio et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Liu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Cheng et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Wu et al. 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Ma et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Zhang et al., 2024</xref>). The tDBD lacks a wing domain and thereby might enable S-HSFs to recognize new heat-responsive DNA elements related to the HSE, while extended motifs or domains are variable in length and sequence and subsequently might contribute to regulatory roles, such as transcriptional regulation. Thus, S-HSFs could represent new kinds of plant HSFs. Considering that unique S-HSFs are expressed mostly under extreme heat stress, they could be associated with plant responses to heat stress. Therefore, uncovering the mechanism through which canonical HSR hyperactivation is regulated by S-HSFs will shed light on the balance between growth and thermotolerance.</p>
<p>In this study, we reported that S-HSFs (<italic>i.e.</italic>, S-HsfA2, S-HsfA4c, and S-HsfB1) are new kinds of HSFs that bind new heat-regulated elements (HREs) and negatively regulate <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> tolerance to extreme heat stress. Using S-HsfA2 as a representative S-HSF, we further investigated the molecular mechanisms by which S-HSFs prevent canonical HSR hyperactivation. The results showed that S-HsfA2 alleviates <italic>HSP17.6B</italic> overexpression-mediated HSR hyperactivation in two different ways: antagonistically repressing <italic>HSP17.6B</italic> overexpression through a noncanonical HSR (S-HsfA2-HRE-<italic>HSP17.6B</italic>) and acting as a negative binding regulator of HSFs to inhibit the binding of HsfA2 to the HSE of the HSP17.6B promoter. Our results reveal new kinds of HSF originating from HSF splicing variants and provide deep mechanistic insights into proper growth control against thermotolerance hyperactivity in plants.</p>

<title>S-HsfA2 confers extreme heat (45°C) sensitivity in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic></title>
<p>S-HsfA2 contains a 42-aa N-terminal domain (N-ter), a 61-aa tDBD, and a 26-aa extended leucine (L)-rich domain (LRD) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). According to the predicted AlphaFold 3D structure of S-HsfA2, the LRD forms an α-helix structure. Given that S-HsfA2 is expressed under extreme heat (42°C) but not under moderate heat (37°C) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Liu et al., 2013</xref>), we determined its role in tolerance to extreme heat. Overexpression of Flag-tagged S-HsfA2 under the control of the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S RNA promoter (35S) (<italic>35S:S-HsfA2-Flag</italic>, S-HsfA2-OE) significantly reduced seedling survival at 45°C for 2 h compared to that of the wild-type (WT) control (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>).</p>

<p>Our previous study showed that LRD is responsible for the transcriptional repression of S-HsfA2 in yeast cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Liu et al., 2013</xref>). We noted that a conserved transcriptional repression motif, LxLxLx (x=any amino acid) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Tiwari and Guilfoyle, 2004</xref>), exists in the LRD (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). Mutations (L to alanine (A)) in the LxLxLx motif (S-HsfA2<sup>L-A</sup>) converted S-HsfA2 from a transcriptional repressor to a transcriptional activator in yeast cells (Supplemental Figure S1), indicating that S-HsfA2 is an LxLxLx-type transcriptional repressor. As a result, overexpression of this dominant activator of S-HsfA2-Flag (S-HsfA2<sup>L-A</sup>-OE) eliminated the extreme heat-sensitive phenotype (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). When the plants were grown in soil, the S-HsfA2 genetic plants also exhibited the same extreme heat response phenotype (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>).</p>
<p>Next, we generated S-HsfA2-encoding mRNA (<italic>HsfA2-III</italic>)<italic>-</italic>knockdown transgenic lines (S-HsfA2-KD) through RNA interference (RNAi) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). In S-HsfA2-KD, the abundance of <italic>HsfA2-III</italic> but not <italic>HsfA2-II</italic> or <italic>HsfA2</italic> mRNA decreased under heat stress. S-HsfA2-KD plants displayed a clear resistance phenotype to extreme heat in both medium and soil (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). Overall, these genetic data strongly confirm that S-HsfA2 is sensitive to extreme heat in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and that the LxLxLx motif is needed for its biological functions.</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<title>The constitutive expression of S-HsfA2 inhibits <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> seedling growth</title>
<p>We also noted that overexpression of S-HsfA2 (S-HsfA2-OE) caused short root length (growth in medium) and seedling dwarfism (growth in soil) under normal conditions (Supplemental Figure S2). However, these growth defects were partially rescued in the S-HsfA2L-A-OE seedlings (Supplemental Figure S2), suggesting that the LxLxLx motif of S-HsfA2 is required for these biological functions. This finding reflected the negative impact of the constitutive expression of S-HsfA2 on <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> seedling growth.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2c">
<title>Heat stress promotes the nuclear accumulation of S-HsfA2</title>
<p>A previous study showed that S-HsfA2 is localized in the nucleus of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> mesophyll protoplasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Liu et al., 2013</xref>). We further investigated the subcellular localization of S-HsfA2 in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> using the <italic>35S:S-HsfA2-GFP</italic> transgene. We found that the GFP signals were distributed throughout the root cells under normal conditions but that the signals accumulated mainly in the nucleus after heat stress treatment (Supplemental Figure S3). This result is consistent with the finding that S-HsfA2 is a transcription factor involved in heat stress regulation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2d">
<title>S-HsfA2 binds a <italic>cis</italic>-acting element termed the heat-regulated element (HRE)</title>
<p>As S-HsfA2 is a transcription factor with a unique tDBD, we identified new <italic>cis</italic>-acting elements other than HSEs recognized by S-HsfA2 through chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) in heat stress-treated <italic>35S:S-HsfA2-GFP</italic> transgenic <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (Supplemental Figure S4A). High-throughput sequencing (seq) of DNA precipitated with an anti-GFP antibody revealed a centrosymmetric 7-bp motif (5′-GAAGAAG-3′). This motif was most significantly enriched (E=10<sup>−19</sup>) in the ChIP-Seq dataset (Supplemental Figure S4B). Because it was demonstrated to be a heat-regulated element, we hereafter named it an HRE.</p>
<p>HSEs are composed of at least three alternating nGAAn/nTTCn blocks (n denotes any nucleotide) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Amin et al., 1988</xref>). Accordingly, an HRE is considered a partially overlapping element of two inverted nGAAn blocks sharing a G base (5′-nGAA-&gt;G&lt;-AAGn-3′), indicating that the HRE and HSE are partially related. From the ChIP-Seq dataset, a total of 80 putative S-HsfA2 targets were identified (Supplemental Figure S4C), 65 of which contained the HRE (Supplemental Table S1).</p>
<p>We next confirmed the binding of S-HsfA2 or tDBD to the HRE. The bacterially expressed and purified glutathione S-transferase (GST)-tagged S-HsfA2 fusion protein (GST-S-HsfA2) (Supplemental Figure S5) was used in electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs). The results showed that GST-S-HsfA2, but not the mock control (GST alone), specifically bound to HRE <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). According to the yeast one-hybrid (Y1H) assay, S-HsfA2 also specifically recognized HRE (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). Interestingly, His6-tDBD recognized the HRE, but His6-DBD bound to the HSE <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>). Consistent with this observation, His-tagged HsfA2 did not bind to HRE <italic>in vitro</italic> (Supplemental Figure S6). These findings indicate that S-HsfA2 uses the tDBD to bind to HREs <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p>

<p>To determine the heat induction effect of HRE, we constructed an HRE trimer driving the minimal 35S promoter (-46/+8, 35Sm)-β-glucuronidase (<italic>GUS</italic>) reporter gene (<italic>HRE-35Sm:GUS</italic>) in transgenic <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). HRE could drive 35Sm to enable clear GUS histochemical staining in seedlings. However, as observed for the vector control (<italic>35Sm:GUS</italic>), mutations in the HRE (<italic>mHRE-35Sm:GUS</italic>) caused a full loss of GUS staining regardless of heat stress. Weak GUS signals were mainly detected in the shoot apical region and the shoot vascular system in the <italic>HRE-35Sm:GUS</italic> seedlings. In a time-course study, GUS signals were enhanced under heat stress (37°C) for 15-30 min, suggesting that GUS might be transported <italic>via</italic> the vascular system from the shoot apical region to the shoot to respond to the heat response at the whole-plant level.</p>

<p>A quantitative GUS expression assay at both the mRNA (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>) and protein (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>) levels revealed that HRE conferred heat responsiveness to 35Sm by 2- to 4-fold. This heat responsiveness was also heat (37°C)-time dependent (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>). HRE-bound nuclear extracts were derived from <italic>Arabidopsis in vitro</italic>, particularly from extreme heat shock (42°C)-treated <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> nuclear extracts (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>), further suggesting that HRE has the biochemical characteristics of a heat response element.

<title>S-HsfA2 acts as an HRE-binding transcription repressor in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic></title>
<p>To determine whether S-HSfA2 depends on the HRE to regulate a gene, we introduced the <italic>35S:S-HsfA2-Flag</italic> or <italic>35S:S-HsfA2<sup>L-A</sup>-Flag</italic> effector into the <italic>HRE-35Sm:GUS</italic> reporter lines by crossing, and we found that GUS protein levels were downregulated compared with those in uncrossed controls (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref>). In contrast, the <italic>35S:S-HsfA2<sup>L-A</sup>-Flag</italic> effector increased GUS levels (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref>). These results confirmed that S-HsfA2 is an HRE-binding transcription repressor. This finding also indicated that the LxLxLx motif within the LRD is needed for S-HsfA2 repression activity in plant cells, which is consistent with findings in yeast cells (Supplemental Figure S1).</p>

<title>S-HsfA2, S-HsfA4c, and S-HsfB1 represent new kinds of plant HSF</title>
<p>Given that S-HsfA2 is an HRE-binding transcriptional repressor and confers extreme heat sensitivity in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, we hypothesized that S-HsfA2 represents a new HSF. The new HSFs are not limited to S-HsfA2 because tDBD is responsible for HRE binding and is highly conserved among S-HSFs. To provide further supporting data, we characterized S-HsfA4c, S-HsfB1, and S-HsfB2a, which were previously identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Liu et al., 2013</xref>).</p>
<p><italic>HsfA4c</italic> (At5G45710) has two splice variants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Liu et al., 2013</xref>): an intron 2-containing predominant S-<italic>HsfA4c</italic> and a less abundant intron 1-containing full-length <italic>HsfA4c. S-HsfA4c</italic> encodes S-HsfA4c. <italic>S-HsfA4c</italic> was constitutively expressed, but heat stress enhanced its expression (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). S-HsfA4c shares similar structural features (LxLxLx motif-containing LRD, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>) with S-HsfA2. S-HsfA4c acted as a transcriptional repressor in yeast cells, and LRD was needed for its transcriptional repression (Supplemental Figure S7). S-HsfA4c bound to the HRE according to both Y1H (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>) and electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>). Overexpression of <italic>35S:S-HsfA4c-GFP</italic> (S-HsfA4c-OE) resulted in heat sensitivity compared with that of the <italic>35S:GFP</italic> vector control (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>), whereas T-DNA insert-mediated knockdown of <italic>S</italic>-<italic>HsfA4</italic>c together with <italic>HsfA4c</italic> increased thermotolerance (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>). Interestingly, heat stress enhanced the translocation of HsfA4c-GFP into the nucleus (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>), similar to what was observed for S-HsfA2-GFP (Supplemental Figure S3).</p>

<p>Like <italic>S-HsfA4c, S-HsfB1</italic> was constitutively expressed, but heat stress strongly increased its expression (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). In contrast, <italic>S-HsfB2a</italic> was heat stress inducible (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). S-HsfB1 and S-HsfB2a were localized to the nucleus of plant cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>). S-HsfB2a is a weak transcriptional activator in yeast cells, but S-HsfB1 has no transactivation activity (Supplemental Figure S8). According to the Y1H results, both S-HsfB1 and S-HsfB2a could bind to the HRE (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>). However, S-HsfB1, but not S-HsfB2a, bound to the HRE <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>). Thus, S-HsfB2a did not appear to be an HRE-binding protein. Therefore, we selected S-HsfB1 for further confirmation of its effects on <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> thermotolerance. We found that seedling survival, especially chlorophyll content, was markedly reduced by S-HsfB1 overexpression (<italic>35S:S-HsfAB1-RFP</italic>) in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> plants under heat stress (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref>). In contrast, the specific knockdown of <italic>S-HsfB1</italic> through antisense RNA (targeting the retained intron sequences) and both the <italic>HsfB1</italic> and <italic>S-HsfB1</italic> double knockout resulted in increased seedling survival, especially in terms of the chlorophyll content, under heat stress (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5F</xref>). Collectively, these data indicate that HRE binding and negative regulatory effects on extreme heat stress tolerance are common for S-HsfA2, S-HsfA4c, and S-HsfB1. Therefore, we conclude that these three S-HSFs represent new kinds of plant HSFs.</p>

<title>S-HsfA2 attenuates HsfA2-regulated <italic>HSP17.6B</italic> promoter expression</title>
<p>We then explored the effects of S-HsfA2, a negative binding regulator of HsfA2, on HsfA2-mediated HSP17.6Bp expression. Based on the interaction between HsfA2-nYFP and S-HsfA2-cYFP in the BiFC assay (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9D</xref>), we used dual-luciferase (LUC) reporter assays to test whether S-HsfA2-cYFP inhibits the <italic>HSP17.6Bp</italic> activity activated by HsfA2-nYFP. To avoid the effect of S-HsfA2 on <italic>HSP17.6Bp</italic>, a short, truncated 135-bp <italic>HSP17.6Bp</italic> (sHSP17.6Bp) containing HSE but lacking an HRE-HRE-like sequence was used in this assay. Compared with the GUS effector controls, HsfA2-nYFP increased <italic>sHSP17.6Bp-LUC</italic> reporter expression in tobacco cells. As expected, S-HsfA2-cYFP failed to regulate sHSP17.6Bp. However, compared with the GUS-cYFP control, S-HsfA2-cYFP reduced the HsfA2-nYFP-mediated <italic>sHSP17.6Bp-LUC</italic> reporter expression level by more than 50% (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Figure 10B</xref>). These results establish the importance of S-HsfA2 in HsfA2-regulated HSP17.6Bp expression by preventing HsfA2 from binding to the HSE.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The AS events of HSFs have been extensively described in plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Sugio et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Liu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Cheng et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Wu et al. 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Ma et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Zhang et al., 2024</xref>), but the specific biological functions of these splice variants and their underlying regulatory mechanisms have largely not been determined. In this study, we demonstrated that <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> S-HSFs, <italic>i.e.</italic>, S-HsfA2, S-HsfA4c, and S-HsfB1, derived from HSF splicing variants represent new kinds of HSF. Several molecular and genetic studies support this conclusion: (<italic>i</italic>) S-HSFs are localized in the nucleus, especially after heat stress, reflecting their cellular heat response features; (<italic>ii</italic>) S-HSFs have a unique conserved tDBD that binds to the HRE, a new heat response element; and (<italic>iii</italic>) S-HSFs confer extreme heat stress sensitivity as negative regulators of heat tolerance. Using S-HsfA2 as a representative S-HSF, we further revealed the molecular mechanisms underlying the ability of S-HSFs to prevent canonical HSR hyperactivation caused by <italic>HSP17.6B</italic> overexpression. Therefore, our findings reveal a novel mechanism by which plants balance thermotolerance and growth and offer insight into the breeding of thermotolerant plants.</p>

<title>Splice variants of HSFs generate new plant HSFs</title>
<p>In this work, we showed that <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> S-HsfA2, S-HsfA4c, and S-HsfB1 are generated from partial or full retention of the conserved intron in the DBD. S-HSFs (such as S-HsfA2, S-HsfA4c, and S-HsfB1) lack all the C-terminal functional domains of HSFs but share a common unique structural feature, <italic>i.e.,</italic> tDBD. Another structural feature of S-HSFs is extended motifs or domains encoded by the retained introns. However, their lengths and sequences vary among different S-HSFs and are therefore less conserved than those of the tDBD. For example, lengths of 26 aa, 30 aa, and 13 aa were found for S-HsfA2, S-HsfA4c, and S-HsfB1, respectively. We found that the extended domain, <italic>i.e.</italic>, the LRD, allows S-HsfA2 to act as a transcriptional repressor. More importantly, LRD is needed for the functions of S-HsfA2 in heat tolerance regulation. Therefore, we concluded that the extended motifs or domains are essential for the functions of S-HSFs.</p>
<p>Although S-HsfA2, S-HsfA4c, and S-HsfB1 only have conserved tDBD sequences plus adjacent extended motifs or domains, these small HSF isoforms are of biological importance since they negatively regulate extreme heat tolerance in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>. Notably, two aspects related to heat stress are consistent with their biological relevance. First, <italic>S-HsfA2</italic>, <italic>S-HsfA4c</italic>, and <italic>S-HsfB1</italic> strongly respond to extreme heat stress, indicating that they function in extreme heat stress in <italic>Arabidopsis.</italic> We also found that the constitutive expression of S-HsfA2 inhibits <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> growth. Considering this, <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> plants do not produce S-HSFs or produce fewer S-HSFs under normal conditions to avoid growth inhibition. Another is the heat stress-induced translocation of S-HsfA2 and S-HsfA4c into the nucleus to regulate target gene transcription. Overall, our data strongly support that S-HSFs act as new kinds of HSFs and thus increase the diversity of HSFs.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, AS events in the DBD of plant HSFs have not been detected in animal HSFs. Several reports have shown that animal HSFs utilize exon skipping to generate HSF splicing isoforms containing full-length DBDs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Tanabe et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Fujikake et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Zhang et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Neueder et al., 2014</xref>). These animal HSF isoforms have different transcriptional activities and work synergistically to regulate the transcription of <italic>HSPs</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Tanabe et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Neueder et al., 2014</xref>). Therefore, new kinds of HSF seem to be plant specific, reflecting a unique feature of plant systems.</p>

<title>HRE is a heat response element</title>
<p>HSE is a known heat-responsive element and is essential for heat-inducible transcription of genes. In this study, we showed that the HRE is a heat response element, as determined by molecular, biochemical, and genetic analyses. HRE confers a minimal promoter response to heat and is responsible for heat-induced expression of the <italic>HSP17.6B</italic> promoter. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">He et al. (2022)</xref> reported a heat stress sensing and transmission pathway at the whole-plant level. Nitric oxide (NO) bursts in the shoot apex under heat stress, and NO, an S-nitrosoglutathione, can rapidly move from shoot to root through the vascular system in whole <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> plants. Interestingly, the GUS reporter driven by HREs was constitutively expressed in the shoot apical region, and heat stress enhanced and promoted GUS movement along the shoot vascular system to the leaves and hypocotyl. Therefore, the HRE exhibits heat stress sensing and transmission patterns, indicating a heat regulation function.</p>
<p>The HRE consists of two inverted HSE blocks (nGAAn) that share a G base. Although HRE is partially related to HSE, it does not bind to the DBD or to HsfA2 <italic>in vitro</italic>. In contrast, HRE is recognized by tDBD, S-HsfA2, S-HsfA4c, and S-HsfB1 <italic>in vitro.</italic> Loss of the wing domain within the DBD might partly explain why the DNA-binding characteristics of the tDBD change.</p>
<p>We also noted that HRE can drive the constitutive expression of the <italic>GUS</italic> reporter and bind nuclear extracts under normal conditions. These data suggest that some unknown constitutive transcription factors other than S-HSFs exist in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>. In the future, these HRE-binding transcription factors need to be screened by Y1H and DNA‒protein pulldown assays. These studies can further characterize the working molecular mechanisms of HRE.</p>

<title>The noncanonical HSR: S-HsfA2-HRE-<italic>HSP17.6B</italic></title>
<p>Using S-HsfA2 as a representative S-HSF, we proposed the S-HsfA2-HRE-<italic>HSP17.6B</italic> noncanonical HSR. In this HSR, S-HsfA2 binds to the HRE-HRE-like element to prevent <italic>HSP17.6B</italic> overexpression and eventually attenuates <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> tolerance to extreme heat. Given that <italic>HSP17.6B</italic> overexpression-mediated heat tolerance hyperactivation represses <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> growth, our results underscore the biological significance of this noncanonical HSR: preventing plant heat tolerance hyperactivation to maintain proper growth. Although we propose a noncanonical HSR based on S-HsfA2, S-HSF-mediated noncanonical HSRs should constitute a widespread regulatory mechanism in planta because the tDBD is highly conserved in S-HSFs and because the HRE can be bound by the tDBD.</p>

<sec id="s3d">
<title>S-HSFs act as new negative binding regulators of HSFs</title>
<p>During the canonical HSR, cells often utilize negative binding regulators of HSFs, including HSP70 and HSF-binding proteins (HSBPs), to inactivate HSFs in different ways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Morimoto, 1998</xref>). HSP70 represses the transcriptional activity of HSFs by directly binding to the transcriptional activation domain (Baler and Voellmy, 1996). HSBPs are conserved small nuclear proteins that dissociate trimeric HSFs and abate transcription activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Satyal et al., 1998</xref>). <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> HSBP (AT4G15802) attenuates the canonical HSR by interacting with HSFs and decreasing HSF DNA-binding activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Hsu et al., 2010</xref>). S-ZmHsf17 can interact with the DBD of ZmHsf17 to suppress the transactivation of ZmHsf17 by reducing the HSE-binding capacity of ZmHsf17 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Zhang et al., 2024</xref>), suggesting that S-HSFs may act as negative binding regulators of HSFs. In the present study, S-HsfA2 was also identified as a negative binding regulator of HsfA2. Unlike HSP70 and HSBPs, S-HsfA2 binds to the DBD, thus decreasing the HSE-binding capacity of HSFs such as HsfA2 and eventually attenuating HsfA2-regulated <italic>HSP17.6B</italic> promoter activity. According to the Y2H results, S-HsfA2 interacts with five HSFs (HsfA1e, HsfA2, HsfA3, HsfA7a, and HsfB2b). It is of interest to explore whether S-HsfA2 inactivates HsfA1e, HsfA3, HsfA7a, and HsfB2b.</p>

<title>S-HsfA2 molecular working model</title>
<p>Taken together, our findings in this study support the use of a molecular model in which S-HsfA2 balances the gain and loss of canonical HsfA2-regulated <italic>HSP17.6B</italic> overexpression-mediated HSR hyperactivation. S-HsfA2 directly binds to the HRE of the <italic>HSP17.6B</italic> promoter to repress <italic>HSP17.6B</italic> expression and interacts with the DBD of HsfA2 to inactivate HsfA2 binding to the <italic>HSP17.6B</italic> promoter, ultimately alleviating hyperactivation of the HsfA2-HSE-<italic>HSP17.6B</italic> HSR (<xref rid="fig11" ref-type="fig">Figure 11</xref>).

<p>This paper reports a novel mechanism of regulation of the heat shock response in plants that acts as a brake to prevent hyperactivation of the stress response. The findings are <bold>valuable</bold> to understand and potentially manipulate the plant's response to heat stress and the presented evidence is overall <bold>solid</bold>.

<p>In the present work, Chen et al. investigate the role of short heat shock factors (S-HSF), generated through alternative splicing, in the regulation of the heat shock response (HSR). The authors focus on S-HsfA2, an HSFA2 splice variant containing a truncated DNA-binding domain (tDBD) and a known transcriptional-repressor leucin-rich domain (LRD). The authors found a two-fold effect of S-HsfA2 on gene expression. On the one hand, the specific binding of S-HsfA2 to the heat-regulated element (HRE), a novel type of heat shock element (HSE), represses gene expression. This mechanism was also shown for other S-HSFs, including HsfA4c and HsfB1. On the other hand, S-HsfA2 is shown to interact with the canonical HsfA2, as well as with a handful of other HSFs, and this interaction prevents HsfA2 from activating gene expression. The authors also identified potential S-HsfA2 targets and selected one, HSP17.6B, to investigate the role of the truncated HSF in the HSR. They conclude that S-HsfA2-mediated transcriptional repression of HSP17.6B helps avoid hyperactivation of the HSR by counteracting the action of the canonical HsfA2.</p>
<p>The manuscript is well written and the reported findings are, overall, solid. The described results are likely to open new avenues in the plant stress research field, as several new molecular players are identified. Chen et al. use a combination of appropriate approaches to address the scientific questions posed. However, in some cases, the data are inadequately presented or insufficient to fully support the claims made. As such, the manuscript would highly benefit from tackling the following issues:</p>
<p>(1) While the authors report the survival phenotypes of several independent lines, thereby strengthening the conclusions drawn, they do not specify whether the presented percentages are averages of multiple replicates or if they correspond to a single repetition. The number of times the experiment was repeated should be reported. In addition, Figure 7c lacks the quantification of the hsp17.6b-1 mutant phenotype, which is the background of the knock-in lines. This is an essential control for this experiment.</p>
<p>(2) In Figure 1c, the transcript levels of HsfA2 splice variants are not evident, as the authors only show the quantification of the truncated variant. Moreover, similar to the phenotypes discussed above, it is unclear whether the reported values are averages and, if so, what is the error associated with the measurements. This information could explain the differences observed in the rosette phenotypes of the S-HsfA2-KD lines. Similarly, the gene expression quantification presented in Figures 4 and 5, as well as the GUS protein quantification of Figure 3F, also lacks this crucial information.</p>
<p>(3) The quality of the main figures is low, which in some cases prevents proper visualization of the data presented. This is particularly critical for the quantification of the phenotypes shown in Figure 1b and for the fluorescence images in Figures 4f and 5b. Also, Figure 9b lacks essential information describing the components of the performed experiments.</p>
<p>(4) Mutants with low levels of S-HsfA2 yield smaller plants than the corresponding wild type. This appears contradictory, given that the proposed role of this truncated HSF is to counteract the growth repression induced by the canonical HSF. What would be a plausible explanation for this observation? Was this phenomenon observed with any of the other tested S-HSFs?</p>
<p>(5) In some cases, the authors make statements that are not supported by the results:</p>
<p>
(i) the claim that only the truncated variant expression is changed in the knock-down lines is not supported by Figure 1c;</p>
<p>
(ii) the increase in GUS signal in Figure 3a could also result from local protein production;</p>
<p>
(iii) in Figure 6b, the deletion of the HRE abolishes heat responsiveness, rather than merely altering the level of response; and</p>
<p>
(iv) the phenotypes in Figure 8b are not clear enough to conclude that HSP17.6B overexpressors exhibit a dwarf but heat-tolerant phenotype.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors report that Arabidopsis short HSFs S-HsfA2, S-HsfA4c, and S-HsfB1 confer extreme heat. They have truncated DNA binding domains that bind to a new heat-regulated element. Considering Short HSFA2, the authors have highlighted the molecular mechanism by which S-HSFs prevent HSR hyperactivation via negative regulation of HSP17.6B. The S-HsfA2 protein binds to the DNA binding domain of HsfA2, thus preventing its binding to HSEs, eventually attenuating HsfA2-activated HSP17.6B promoter activity. This report adds insights to our understanding of heat tolerance and plant growth.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) The manuscript represents ample experiments to support the claim.</p>
<p>
(2) The manuscript covers a robust number of experiments and provides specific figures and graphs in support of their claim.</p>
<p>
(3) The authors have chosen a topic to focus on stress tolerance in a changing environment.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) One s-HsfA2 represents all the other s-Hsfs; S-HsfA4c, and S-HsfB1. s-Hsfs can be functionally different. Regulation may be positive or negative. Maybe the other s-hsfs may positively regulate for height and be suppressed by the activity of other s-hsfs.</p>
<p>(2) Previous reports on gene regulations by hsfs can highlight the mechanism.</p>
<p>(3) The Materials and Methods section could be rearranged so that it is based on the correct flow of the procedure performed by the authors.</p>
<p>(4) Graphical representation could explain the days after sowing data, to provide information regarding plant growth.</p>
<p>(5) Clear images concerning GFP and RFP data could be used.</p>
