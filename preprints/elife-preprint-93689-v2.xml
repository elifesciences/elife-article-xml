<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Complex macro-scale patterns of brain activity that emerge during periods of wakeful rest provide insight into the organisation of neural function, how these differentiate individuals based on their traits, and the neural basis of different types of self-generated thoughts. Although brain activity during wakeful rest is valuable for understanding important features of human cognition, its unconstrained nature makes it difficult to disentangle neural features related to personality traits from those related to the thoughts occurring at rest. Our study builds on recent perspectives from work on ongoing conscious thought that highlight the interactions between three brain networks - ventral and dorsal attention networks, as well as the default mode network. We combined measures of personality with state-of-the-art indices of ongoing thoughts at rest and brain imaging analysis and explored whether this ‘tri-partite’ view can provide a framework within which to understand the contribution of states and traits to observed patterns of neural activity at rest. To capture macro-scale relationships between different brain systems, we calculated cortical gradients to describe brain organisation in a low dimensional space. Our analysis established that for more introverted individuals, regions of the ventral attention network were functionally more aligned to regions of the somatomotor system and the default mode network. At the same time, a pattern of detailed self-generated thought was associated with a decoupling of regions of dorsal attention from regions in the default mode network. Our study, therefore, establishes that interactions between attention systems and the default mode network are important influences on ongoing thought at rest and highlights the value of integrating contemporary perspectives on conscious experience when understanding patterns of brain activity at rest.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Macro-scale patterns of brain activity at rest have the potential for elucidating the organisation of neural function, different types of psychiatric conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Cao et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Koban et al., 2021</xref>), developmental changes including those during adolescence and old age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Dosenbach et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Cui et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Gratton et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">Wen et al., 2020</xref>), neurological disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93">Zhang et al., 2021</xref>) and are important for revealing the neural basis behind the landscape of self-generated experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Karapanagiotidis et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Mckeown et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Kucyi et al., 2021</xref>). However, compared to controlled experimental conditions, interpreting neural activity recorded during resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) is challenging, partly because both trait-level aspects of the individual, and, the inherently complex and dynamic nature of ongoing experience at rest are both contributory factors to the observed brain activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Smallwood et al., 2021b</xref>). It has recently been suggested that the meaning of different patterns of neural activity can be usefully constrained by pairing imaging data at rest with additional measures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Finn, 2021</xref>), for example by accounting for the patterns of thoughts individuals experience at rest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Karapanagiotidis et al., 2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Mckeown et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Gonzalez-Castillo et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Kucyi et al., 2021</xref>), trait variation in how people think during tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Smallwood et al., 2016</xref>) or features of their personality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Hsu et al., 2018</xref>). While this methodological perspective is invaluable, we currently lack a theoretical framework within which to understand the brain-cognition relationships that these observations will establish. To address this gap in the literature, our study explores whether contemporary theories of the neural basis of ongoing conscious thought can provide a framework within which to interpret associations between macro-scale patterns of neural activity observed at rest, and measures of traits and self-reports of ongoing experience.</p>
<p>Emerging views of how the brain supports patterns of ongoing conscious thought highlight interactions between three large scale networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Menon, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Huang et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Smallwood et al., 2021b</xref>): the ventral attention network (VAN), the dorsal attention network (DAN) and the default mode network (DMN)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1">⊕</xref></sup>. Traditionally, it was argued that the DMN was thought to have an antagonistic relationship with systems linked to external processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Fox et al., 2005</xref>). However, according to the ‘tri-partite’ network accounts the relationship between the DMN and other brain systems is more nuanced. From this perspective key hubs of the ventral attention network, such as the anterior insula and dorso-lateral prefrontal cortex, help gate access to conscious experience regardless of the focus of attention. This is hypothesised to occur because the VAN influences interactions between the DAN, which is more important for external mental content (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Corbetta and Shulman, 2002</xref>), and the DMN which is important when states (including tasks) rely more on internal representations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Smallwood et al., 2021a</xref>). For example, Huang and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Huang et al., 2021</xref>) established that activity levels in the anterior insula determine whether stimuli presented at perceptual threshold are consciously perceived, and this gating of external input emerged as a consequence of changes in the normal interactions between the DAN and DMN. They also found that disruptions to activity in the insula through anaesthesia resulted in reductions in self-generated mental imagery. Coming from a different perspective, Turnbull and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Turnbull et al., 2019b</xref>) used experience sampling during task performance to link patterns of neural activity to different features of ongoing thought. For example, they found activity in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (a member of the VAN according to a parcellation by Yeo, Krienen and colleagues, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">Yeo et al., 2011</xref>) was correlated with apparently contradictory patterns of ongoing thought – (i) self-generated episodic thoughts during periods of low demands, and (ii) patterns of detailed task focus when individuals were engaged in demanding external task. In the same study, however, neural activity within regions of the dorsal parietal cortex within the DAN, was exclusively reduced when participants engaged in self-generated thinking, highlighting a parallel neglect of external input seen by Huang and colleagues. Finally, in a second study, Turnbull and colleagues found that at rest, trait variance in the ability to focus on self-generated experience in laboratory situations with lower task demands is associated with decoupling of signals arising from the DAN and DMN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Turnbull et al., 2019a</xref>). Summarising this emerging evidence, studies focused on understanding ongoing thought patterns from different perspectives converge on the view that regions of the VAN may be important for gating conscious access to different types of content by biasing interactions between the DAN and the DMN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Huang et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Smallwood et al., 2021b</xref>).</p>
<p>Our current study explored whether this “tri-partite network” view of ongoing conscious thought derived from studies focused on understanding conscious experience, provides a useful organising framework for understanding the relation between observed brain activity at rest and patterns of cognition/ personality traits. Such analysis is important because at rest there are multiple features of brain activity that can be identified via complex analyses that include regions that show patterns of coactivation (which are traditionally viewed as forming a cohesive network, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Biswal et al., 1995</xref>) as well as patterns of anti-correlation with other regions (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Fox et al., 2005</xref>). However, it is unclear which of these relationships reflect aspects of cognition or behaviour or are in fact aspects of the functional organisation of the cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Fox and Raichle, 2007</xref>). Consequently, our study builds on foundational work (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Vanhaudenhuyse et al., 2011</xref>) in order to better understand which aspects of neural function observed at rest are mostly likely linked to cognition and behaviour. With this aim in mind, we examined links between macro-scale neural activation and both (i) trait descriptions of individuals and (ii) patterns of ongoing thought. Our sample was a cohort of 144 participants who underwent a one-hour resting-state scan. Across this one-hour period, participants were interrupted on four occasions to answer a set of questions about their experiences at rest using multidimensional experience sampling (MDES), similar to a number of prior neuroimaging studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Smallwood et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Poerio et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">Wang et al., 2018</xref>). During a different session, the same participants also completed a battery of measures assessing features of their personality (such as the Big five (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Costa and McCrae, 2008</xref>)) as well as subclinical/ psychiatric traits such as trait anxiety and depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c94">Zigmond and Snaith, 1983</xref>). Since our research question depends on understanding the hypothesised relationship between large scale networks (VAN, DMN and DAN), we used the BrainSpace toolbox (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">Vos de Wael et al., 2020</xref>) to provide whole brain low dimensional representations of functional brain organisation, generating maps which represent the similarities and differences in the activity within different systems. We used R version 4.2.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">R Core Team, 2021</xref>) to produce low dimensional representations of both traits and thoughts using principal component analysis (PCA). Using these two sets of data, we performed multiple regression to identify how brain network organisation varies with traits and states. In these analyses, the low dimensional representations of brain organisation were the dependent measures, and the components of traits and states were explanatory variables.</p>

<sec id="s2a">
<title>Data</title>
<p>The dataset used here is part of the MPI-Leipzig Mind-Brain-Body (MPILMBB) database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Mendes et al., 2019</xref>). The complete dataset consists of a battery of self-reported personality measures, measures of spontaneous thought, task data, and structural and resting-state functional MRI from participants between 20 and 75 years of age. Data were collected over a period of five days, with the MRI sessions always falling on day 3. The questionnaires were completed by participants before and after this day, using Limesurvey (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.limesurvey.org">https://www.limesurvey.org</ext-link>: version 2.00+) at their own convenience and using pen-and-paper on-site. A detailed description of the participants, measures, and data acquisition protocol has been previously published along with the dataset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Mendes et al., 2019</xref>).</p>
<sec id="s2a1">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>We limited our investigation to personality and thought self-reports, and rs-fMRI from participants under 50 years of age, who had complete data from at least three resting-state scans. The resulting sample included 144 participants (74 men, mean age= 26.77 years, SD= 4.03; 70 women, mean age = 26.93 years, SD = 5.55).</p>

<sec id="s2a2">
<title>Resting state fMRI with Multidimensional Experience Sampling (MDES)</title>
<p>The current sample includes one hour of fully pre-processed rs-fMRI data from 144 participants (four scans from 135 participants, and three scans from nine participants whose data were missing or incomplete). The rs-fMRI was performed in four adjacent 15-minute sessions each immediately followed by MDES which retrospectively measured various dimensions of spontaneous thought during the scan. Images were acquired in axial orientation using T2∗-weighted gradient-echo echo planar imaging (GE-EPI) sensitive to blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) contrast. Sequences were identical across the four runs, except for alternating slice orientation and phase-encoding direction, to vary the spatial distribution of distortions and signal loss. Motion correction parameters were derived by rigid-body realignment of the time-series to the first (after discarding the first five volumes) volume with FSL MCFLIRT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Jenkinson et al., 2002</xref>). Parameters for distortion correction were calculated by rigidly registering a temporal mean image of this time series to the fieldmap magnitude image using FSL FLIRT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Jenkinson and Smith, 2001</xref>) which was then unwarped using FSL FUGUE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Jenkinson et al., 2012</xref>). Transformation parameters were derived by coregistering the unwarped temporal mean to the subject’s structural scan using FreeSurfer’s boundary-based registration algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Greve and Fischl, 2009</xref>). All three spatial transformations were then combined and applied to each volume of the original time series in a single interpolation step. The time series was residualised against the six motion parameters, their first derivatives, “outliers” identified by Nipype’s rapidart algorithm (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://nipype.readthedocs.io/en/latest/interfaces/">https://nipype.readthedocs.io/en/latest/interfaces/</ext-link> A CompCor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Behzadi et al., 2007</xref>) approach was implemented to remove physiological noise from the residual time-series-which included first six principal components from all the voxels identified as white-matter cerebrospinal fluid. The denoised time series were temporally filtered to a frequency range between 0.01 and 0.1 Hz using FSL, mean centered and variance normalized using Nitime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Rokem et al., 2009</xref>). Imaging and pre-processing protocols are described in detail in Mendes et al (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Mendes et al., 2019</xref>).</p>
<p>The MDES battery included 12 statements (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>) which participants rated on a visual analog scale with 5% response increments that go from 0% = “describes my thoughts not at all” to 100% = “describes my thoughts completely”.

<title>Dimension reduction for questionnaire and MDES data</title>
<p>We performed two separate principal component analyses (PCA) to obtain low dimensional summaries of the 71 trait variables from 21 questionnaires, and 12 thought variables from MDES. 71 scores from the personality questionnaires of 144 participants were included and missing data (3.15% of including all variables) were imputed by the variable mean. PCA was performed on this matrix and five “trait” components (henceforth referred to as “traits”) were selected on the basis of eigenvalues &gt;1, using the Kaiser-Guttman criterion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Joliffe, 2002</xref>) and their congruence with the previously well-established “Big Five” personality traits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Digman, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Cobb-Clark and Schurer, 2012</xref>). For the MDES data, separate instances of responding for each participant were concatenated, resulting in a matrix with 576 observations of 12 variables. PCA was performed on this matrix, and five “thought” components (henceforth referred to as “thought patterns”) were selected on the basis of eigenvalues &gt;1. Varimax rotation was applied to both solutions to optimize the distinctiveness of each component. The five thought pattern scores were then averaged across the four scans, resulting in one score for each thought pattern for each participant, describing their location on a particular thought dimension.</p>

<title>Dimension reduction for whole-brain functional connectivity</title>
<p>Functional time-series for each participant was extracted using the Schaefer 400 parcellation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Schaefer et al., 2018</xref>) using the fully pre-processed data from all four resting-state scans. The data from separate scans were concatenated, and a 400×400 connectivity matrix was calculated from the resulting time series for each participant using Pearson correlation. A group connectivity matrix of the whole sample was calculated by averaging the 144 individual matrices.</p>
<p>In order to summarize whole brain connectivity in a low-dimensional space, we performed gradient analysis using the BrainSpace toolbox (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">Vos de Wael et al., 2020</xref>). 10 macro-scale gradients were calculated for the group (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). First, we applied fisher’s z transform to the group matrix, building an affinity matrix (kernel= normalized angle, sparsity= 0.9) and then decomposed it using PCA. We chose the PCA approach for gradient calculation, as Hong and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Hong et al., 2020</xref>) have shown that compared to non-linear decomposition methods, PCA provides better reliability and higher phenotypic predictive value for connectivity gradients. For ease of interpretation and comparability, group gradients were aligned to a subsample of the HCP dataset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Van Essen et al., 2013</xref>) included in BrainSpace. Finally, following Mckeown et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Mckeown et al., 2020</xref>) 10 gradients were calculated in order to maximize the gradient fit for all individuals during alignment. Individual gradients were calculated for each participant, aligned to the group-level gradients, resulting in a 400×10 matrix for each participant. 10 gradients were calculated to facilitate alignment across individuals irrespective of differences in rank order of individual gradients (to control for the possibility, for example, that the pattern summarised by group-level Gradient 2 is Gradient 4 for some participants). Subsequent regression analyses were limited to the first three group-aligned gradients, which have been relatively well-characterized in previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Margulies et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Mckeown et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Turnbull et al., 2020b</xref>). To visualize the functional axis captured by each gradient, we performed Neurosynth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">Yarkoni et al., 2011</xref>) decoding on the group gradient maps (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). Further, we calculated the average gradient score for all parcels within each of the seven connectivity networks described by Yeo and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">Yeo et al., 2011</xref>) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>).</p>

<title>Stability of thoughts-patterns and gradients</title>
<p>To quantify the stability of thoughts and connectivity gradients over the whole scanning period, intra-class correlation coefficients (ICC) were calculated for the thought patterns and following Hong and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Hong et al., 2020</xref>), discriminability indices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Bridgeford et al., 2021</xref>) were calculated for whole gradients by treating the 4 scans and subsequent thought probes as separate instances. We used the two-way mixed effects model (i.e. type 3 ICC) used for quantifying test-retest reliability, where samples cannot be considered independent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Koo and Li, 2016</xref>). Only the 135 participants who had four full-length resting state scans were included in this analysis. As this analysis found reasonable levels of reliability (see below), the averages of the four separate thought scores were used as regressors in subsequent analysis. This allowed for both a robust measure of thought patterns over the whole testing period, and the inclusion of all 144 participants in the analysis.</p>

<title>Multiple Multivariate Regression</title>
<p>To investigate the relationship between individual differences in traits, thoughts, and macro-scale cortical gradients, we used multiple multivariate regression as implemented in the MATLAB SurfStat Toolbox (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">Worsley et al., 2009</xref>) [<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.math.mcgill.ca/keith/surfstat/">http://www.math.mcgill.ca/keith/surfstat/</ext-link>]. 400 separate linear models were estimated for 400 parcels, with the gradient scores from the first three gradients as the dependent variables, and with five trait scores (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>) and five thought scores (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>), as well as nuisance variables age, motion, and gender included as independent variables. The resulting significant effects from 400 parcels were corrected for False Discovery Rate (FDR, q &lt; .05) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Storey, 2003</xref>) at the multivariate (three gradients) level. In order to test which gradient score was affected, follow-up univariate analyses were performed on the resulting parcels for each gradient separately, and effects were further Bonferroni corrected (p<sub>bonf</sub> &lt; .025) for the total number of comparisons performed for all parcels (including the analyses of all three gradients) for each variable. Additionally, to see how the trait components related to the thought components, we performed multiple multivariate regression with the thoughts as dependent variables and traits as independent variables.</p>

<title>Traits and thought patterns</title>
<p>Application of PCA to the battery of personality questionnaires resulted in five “traits” (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1 A</xref>, <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>) with eigenvalues &gt; 1, explaining 48.4% of the variance. The five trait components, independent of the direction of loadings, largely map onto the “big five” personality factors: neuroticism, conscientiousness (positive loading on “procrastination” in our PCA result), extraversion (positive loading on “introversion” in our PCA result), agreeableness (positive loading on anti-social in our results) and openness to experience, respectively. Application of PCA to the MDES questions revealed five “thought patterns” (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 2</xref>) with eigenvalues&gt;1, explaining 65.4% of the variance. Based on the most heavily loaded dimensions within each pattern, we named these: “modality” (image vs words), “positive episodic social”, “specific internal”, “self-relevant” and “prospective”.</p>
<sec id="s3a1">
<title>Intraclass correlation – thoughts</title>
<p>Our first analysis established the reliability of thought components across the one hour of scanning. The five thought patterns showed low to moderate agreement between individual scores from single sessions (modality = 0.5856, positive episodic-social= 0.4531, specific internal= 0.5226, self-relevant = 0.5832, prospective= 0.3118), indicating a degree of variability between sessions. The average of all scores had high ICCs for the first four components (modality = 0.8497, positive episodic social = 0.7783, specific internal = 0.8141, self-relevant = 0.8484, prospective = 0.6444). The average scores from 4 sessions were used as regressors in subsequent analyses.</p>
<p>Next, we examined the relationship between the low dimensional representations of both personality and thoughts. Multiple multivariate regression using traits as predictor variables of thought patterns established that “negative affect” had a significant effect on thoughts (5,134) = 3.88, p = 0.003, partial η² = 0.127). Univariate follow-up showed that a high score on trait neuroticism was significantly associated with less “positive episodic social” thought (pattern 2; ß = -0.229, 95% CI = [-0.389 -0.07], p = 0.005, partial η² = 0.055) as well as greater “self-relevant” thought (pattern 4; ß = 0.229, 95% CI = [0.066 0.391], p = 0.006, partial η² = 0.053), (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref>).</p>

<title>Macro-scale cortical gradients</title>
<p>The first three group level gradients are shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref> along with their Neurosynth meta-analytic associations and relationships to the Yeo-networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">Yeo et al., 2011</xref>) (7-network solution). The first gradient (G1) differentiates between visual regions at one end and DMN at the other. The second gradient (G2) describes the dissociation between somatomotor and visual cortices. The third gradient (G3) captures the segregation between different transmodal systems (the default mode network versus the fronto-parietal system). The three gradients are largely similar to the ones reported by Margulies et al.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Margulies et al., 2016</xref>) and subsequent literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Hong et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Paquola et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bethlehem et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Mckeown et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Turnbull et al., 2020b</xref>). Due to the difference in the decomposition provided by PCA vs. DM approach, the endpoints of G1 are different from those first reported by Margulies et al (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Margulies et al., 2016</xref>) in that one end is anchored by the visual network alone, as opposed to visual and somatomotor, while in G2, the somatomotor network is separated from both the visual and default mode networks, as opposed to the visual network alone in the (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Margulies et al., 2016</xref>) study. However, like those reported by Margulies and colleagues, the first two gradients together describe network-level connectivity space anchored at three ends by the visual, somatomotor and default mode network, respectively (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). Stability of results irrespective of the decomposition approach is shown in <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">supplementary Figure 4</xref>. Single gradients tended to be stable over the 4 sessions, with a discriminability index of 0.964 for Gradient 1, 0.918 for Gradient 2, and 0.983 for Gradient 3 over four adjacent scans from 135 participants.

<title>Relationship between state-trait variability and cortical gradients</title>
<p>Having established low dimensional representations of thought, personality, and brain organisation, we next examined associations between different types of personality and ongoing thought experienced during the scan and our metrics of functional brain organisation. To this end, we performed a multiple multivariate regression with thoughts, traits, and nuisance variables (motion, age and gender) as independent variables, with whole brain functional organisation, as captured by the first three gradients, as dependent variables. In this analytic approach relationships between cognition along one gradient but not along another help identify which relationships between brain systems are mostly likely to relate to the feature of cognition in question (i.e. each gradient acts as a control for the other). In these analyses both trait “introversion” and a pattern describing “specific internal” thought showed significant effects at the multivariate level.

<title>Trait Introversion</title>
<p>Along the first gradient, a parcel within the right orbitofrontal cortex (within the executive control network, shown in orange) showed more similarity with transmodal regions for individuals high on introversion. Six parcels within the ventral attention network, including anterior insula, operculum and cingulate cortex were closer to the somatomotor end along gradient two (shown in purple). The same regions showed lower scores along the third gradient in participants with higher introversion scores, indicating stronger integration with the default mode network. A parcel within posterior cingulate cortex (control) was also more segregated from the visual end of gradient two in participants with higher introversion scores.

<title>Specific internal cognition</title>
<p>Relationships with patterns of more specific internal cognition were confined to the dorsal attention and visual networks. A region within the superior parietal lobule (DAN) had lower scores on the first gradient (more transmodal) and higher scores on the second gradient (less visual), indicating less similarity with visual regions whose ongoing experience was more “specific” and “internal”. Along the third gradient, higher “specific internal” thought scores were associated with greater separation between these regions and the default mode network. Finally, a parcel within the parahippocampal gyrus/ extrastriate (visual network) showed a broad spread along gradient one, with participants with higher “specific internal” thought scores falling on the transmodal/ DMN side and participants with lower scores (higher “surroundings”) closer to the visual system side.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our study investigated whether an emerging “tri-partite” perspective from contemporary views of ongoing conscious thought can provide a framework that can account for the relationship between dispositional traits, self-reports of ongoing thought, and individual differences in large scale patterns of neural connectivity at rest. This tri-partite network account emphasises the roles of regions embedded within three large scale networks as important for ongoing experience: the ventral attention network, the dorsal attention network and the default mode network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Huang et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Smallwood et al., 2021b</xref>). We calculated macro-scale connectivity gradients from one hour of resting state fMRI for 144 participants. The variability of these gradients was then analysed as a function of self-reports of ongoing thought patterns (captured by the principal components of MDES) and personality traits (described by the principal components of a battery of personality and habit measures). Given the tendency of certain traits to be correlated with frequency of specific patterns of thought (e.g. depression level with intrusive and negative thought (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Konu et al., 2021</xref>) we also looked for possible dependencies between trait and thought components through multivariate regression using traits as predictors.</p>
<p>Our analyses confirmed that both patterns of thought, and indices of traits, contribute to patterns of brain organisation in a manner that converges with the emerging tri-partite view of ongoing conscious thought. For example, it has been hypothesised that the ventral attention network (VAN) helps adjudicate between internal and external influences on ongoing thought (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Huang et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Smallwood et al., 2021b</xref>) and we found that individuals who were high on dispositional “introversion” showed variation in anterior insula, overlying operculum and ACC: all regions making up part of the VAN. For more introverted people these regions showed greater alignment with somatomotor regions and less with visual cortex (gradient 2), and greater alignment with default mode network than the fronto-parietal network (gradient 3). Notably, prior studies have found that regions of sensorimotor cortex are linked to deliberate mind-wandering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Golchert et al., 2017</xref>) and individuals who tend to generate patterns of episodic social cognition during periods of low task demands show greater temporal correlation between the VAN and sensori-motor cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Turnbull et al., 2019a</xref>). Introversion reflects a predisposition towards internal subjective states rather than external objects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Jung, 1995</xref>), and so our analysis adds to an emerging literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Golchert et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Turnbull et al., 2019a</xref>) that suggests that there may be an important relationship between sensorimotor cortex and the ventral attention network in patterns of internal self-generated thought.</p>
<p>Our study also highlighted that associations between observed patterns of neural organisation at rest and patterns of ongoing thought are consistent with the hypothesized tripartite view (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Huang et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Smallwood et al., 2021b</xref>). For example, we found a pattern of detailed thinking during wakeful rest that was correlated with stronger decoupling between a region within dorsal parietal cortex from the visual network (as indexed by changes in both gradients 1 and 2), and greater separation from the default mode network (gradient 3). This region overlaps with a region within the DAN identified by (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Turnbull et al., 2019b</xref>) in which brain activity was reduced during self-generated thoughts relative to external task focus, suggesting an important role for the DAN in external facing attention. Furthermore, using a technique known as “echoes” analysis (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Leech et al., 2012</xref>), Turnbull and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Turnbull et al., 2019b</xref>) established that individuals who engaged in self-generated thought during situations of low external demand, at rest showed greater separation between the dorsal attention network and lateral regions of the default mode network in a region of the dLPFC, also a member of the VAN. Thus, our study confirms prior studies that highlight that greater segregation between the DAN and the DMN in the capacity to engage in thoughts that are less linked to the external environment. Together, the convergence between the current analysis and perspectives from research on conscious experience highlight a high degree of overlap in both the regions identified and the hypothesised functions. Our observations are important, therefore, because they help establish that with the appropriate methodology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Mckeown et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Finn, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Gonzalez-Castillo et al., 2021</xref>) neural accounts of conscious experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Huang et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Smallwood et al., 2021b</xref>) provide an important valuable way to make sense of brain-cognition links observed at rest. Second, our data provides evidence for the “decoupling” hypothesis of self-generated experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Smallwood, 2013a</xref>). This perspective emerged from observations that cortical processing of external inputs is reduced when individuals focus on internal self-generated thought (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Smallwood et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Kam et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Baird et al., 2014</xref>), and assumes that this reduced processing of external input allows an internal train of thought to persist in a more detailed manner (p.524,Smallwood, 2013 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Smallwood, 2013b</xref>)). Our data is consistent with this view since both personality traits linked to internal focus (“introversion”), and patterns of detail experience that are not directed externally (“specific internal thought”), are linked to reductions in the similarity between neural activity in regions linked to attention and cognition, with regions of visual cortex. In this way our study provides novel insight into how the macro-scale functional patterns across the cortex support the emergence of detailed patterns of internal experience. Critically, in our study there was no external task from which thinking needed to be decoupled from, ruling out accounts of this process as a “lapse” in the normal upregulation of task relevant material needed for task completion (for discussion see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Franklin et al., 2013</xref>, Smallwood 2013ab).</p>
<p>Although our study establishes how contemporary work on conscious experience can help understand patterns of brain organisation observed at rest and highlights how these approaches can be leveraged to understand the neural correlates of both an individuals’ traits, and their thoughts, there are nonetheless important questions that our study leaves open. For example, contemporary work on ongoing conscious thought highlights time and context as key variables necessary for understanding the neural correlates of different features of thinking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Smallwood et al., 2021b</xref>). Since the aim of our study was to focus on the brain at rest, interpretations of our results should bear in mind that under different task conditions, neural correlates between thinking, personality and neural activity may be different. For example, prior studies have established that posterior elements of the default mode network can become integrated into task positive systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Krieger-Redwood et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">Vatansever et al., 2017</xref>) and under demanding task conditions the default mode network is linked to patterns of task focused cognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Sormaz et al., 2018</xref>). Similarly, our analysis focused on ‘static’ indices of neural activity rather than dynamic measures. We chose to focus on static indices of neural activity because our prior studies have shown that brain-behaviour correlations can be relatively stable over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">Wang et al., 2020</xref>), and as we establish in our study these patterns show reasonable stability across a one hour session. Furthermore, our study, particularly with respect to the findings relating to DAN, map closely onto studies that use experience sampling to identify momentary correlations between neural activity and experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Turnbull et al., 2019b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">2019a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">2020b</xref>). Nonetheless, there are likely to be important dynamic features of ongoing experience that our analysis of static brain organisation cannot capture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Kucyi, 2018</xref>). Recent discussions in cognitive neuroscience have highlighted the link between sample size and the reproducibility of brain-wide associations with behavioural phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Marek et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Spisak et al., 2023</xref>). Our analysis of the trait and thought data alone revealed that “neuroticism” was related to high negative and episodic thoughts, however, we did not find any other significant relationships among traits and thought patterns. In the current data, neuroticism was the most prominent out of all five traits included in the analysis, accounting for 29% of the total variance explained by them. It is therefore likely that more extensive and robust correlations between thoughts patterns and other traits, as well as thoughts, traits and macroscale connectivity patterns would emerge with data sets with larger sample sizes. In the future it may also be important to consider measures of traits that could have relationships to both neural activity and or experience at rest (e.g. self-consciousness <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">de Caso et al., 2017</xref>, or autistic tendencies, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Turnbull et al., 2020a</xref>). It is worth noting that mapping momentary changes between ongoing experience and neural activity will likely depend on a data set tailored to this question, in particular in which (i) experience sampling measures are collected more frequently as well as (ii) methodological advances that allow patterns of activity to be mapped without using temporal correlation. and that measure thinking across multiple contexts.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors ran an explorative analysis in order to describe how a &quot;tri-partite&quot; brain network model could describe the combination between resting fMRI data and individual characteristics. They utilized previously obtained fMRI data across four scanning runs in 144 individuals. At the end of each run, participants rated their patterns of thinking on 12 statements (short multi-dimensional experience sampling-MDES) using a 0-100% visual analog scale. Also, 71 personality traits were obtained on 21 questionnaires. The authors ran two separate principal component analyses (PCAs) to obtain low dimensional summaries of the two individual characteristics (personality traits from questionnaires, and thought patterns from MDES). The dimensionality reduction of the fMRI data was done by means of gradient analysis, which was combined with Neurosynth decoding to visualize the functional axis of the gradients. To test the reliability of thought components across scanning time, intra-class correlation coefficients (ICC) were calculated for the thought patterns, and discriminability indices were calculated for whole gradients. The relationship between individual differences in traits, thoughts, and macro-scale gradients was tested with multivariate regression. The authors found: a) reliability of thought components across the one hour of scanning, b) Gradient 1 differentiated between visual regions and DMN, Gradient 2 dissociated somatomotor from visual cortices, Gradient 3 differentiated the DMN from the fronto-parietal system), c) the associations between traits/thought patterns and brain gradients revealed significant associations with &quot;introversion&quot; and &quot;specific internal&quot; thought: &quot;Introversion&quot; was associated with variant parcels on the three gradients, with most of parcels belonging to the VAN and then to the DMN; and &quot;Specific internal thought&quot; was associated with variant parcels on the three gradients with most of parcels belonging to the DAN and then the visual. The authors conclude that interactions between attention systems and the DMN are important influences on ongoing thought at rest.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The study's strength lies in its attempt to combine brain activity with individual characteristics using state-of-the-art methodologies.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
The study protocol in its current form restricts replicability. This is largely due to missing information on the MRI protocol and data preprocessing. The article refers the reader to the work of Mendes et al 2019 which is said to provide this information, but the paper should rather stand alone with all this crucial material mentioned here, as well. Also, effect sizes are provided only for the multiple multivariate regression of the inter-class correlations, which makes it difficult to appreciate the power of the other obtained results.</p>

<p>The authors set out to draw further links between neural patterns observed at &quot;rest&quot; during fMRI, with their related thought content and personality traits. More specifically, they approached this with a &quot;tri-partite network&quot; view in mind, whereby the ventral attention network (VAN), the dorsal attention network (DAN) and the default mode network (DMN) are proposed to play a special role in ongoing conscious thought. They used a gradient approach to determine the low dimensional organisation of these networks. In concert, using PCA they reduced thought patterns captured at four time points during the scan, as well as traits captured from a large battery of questionnaires.</p>
<p>The main findings were that specific thought and trait components were related to variations in the organisation of the tri-partite networks, with respect to cortical gradients.</p>
<p>Strengths of the methods/results: Having a long (1 hour) resting state MRI session, which could be broken down into four separate scanning/sampling components is a strength. Importantly, the authors could show (via intra-class correlation coefficients) similarity of thoughts and connectivity gradients across the entire session. Not only did this approach increase the richness of the data available to them, it speaks in an interesting way to the stability of these measures. The inclusion of both thought patterns during scanning along with trait-level dispositional factors is most certainly a strength, as many studies will often include either/or of these, rather than trying to reconcile across. Of the two main findings, the finding that detailed self-generated thought was associated with a decoupling of regions of DAN from regions in DMN was particularly compelling, in light of mounting literature from several fields that support this.</p>
<p>Weaknesses of the methods/results: Considering the richness of the thought and personality data, I was a little surprised that only two main findings emerged (i.e., a relationship with trait introversion, and a relationship with the &quot;specific internal&quot; thought pattern). I wondered whether, at least in part and in relation to traits, this might stem from the large and varied set of questionnaires used to discern the traits. These questionnaires mostly comprised personality/mood, but some sampled things that do not fall into that category (e.g., musicality, internet addition, sleep) and some related directly to spontaneous thought properties (e.g., mind wandering, musical imagery). It would be interesting to see what relationships would emerge by being more selective in the traits measured, and in the tools to measure them.</p>
<p>Taken together, the main findings are interesting enough. However, the real significance of this work and its impact, lie in the richness of the approach: combing across fMRI, spontaneous thought, and trait-level factors. Triangulating across these data has important potential for furthering our understanding of brain-behaviour relationship across different levels of organisation.</p>

<p>Thank you for these comments. We have addressed both issues by adding effect sizes for reported trait and thought related effects within the results table (Table 3, Line 427) and providing more information about the fMRI protocol and preprocessing steps.  (Lines 162- 188)</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>We agree that being more selective in trait measures and measuring tools could lead to more insights into trait – brain relationships. In part the emergence of only two main findings could also be a trade-off of multiple comparison corrections inherent in our current approach (i.e. 400 separate models for all parcels). Furthermore, we have adjusted the text in the discussion in this revision to highlight that more targeted measures of personality (e.g. self-consciousness) could provide a more nuanced view of the relationship between traits and patterns of thought at rest. (Line 532):</p>
<p>“In the future it may also be important to consider measures of traits that could have relationships to both neural activity and or experience at rest (e.g. self-consciousness de Caso et al., 2017, or autistic tendencies, Turnbull et al., 2020a).”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Taken together, the main findings are interesting enough. However, the real significance of this work, and its impact, lie in the richness of the approach: combing across fMRI, spontaneous thought, and trait-level factors. Triangulating these data has important potential for furthering our understanding of brain-behaviour relationship across different levels of organisation.</p>
<p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>Recommendations for improving the writing and presentation.</p>
<p>- Frame the study objectives more clearly. If it's about which theoretical framework best supports the data, you might need to advocate on why the tri-partite approach is a more efficient framework than others. If not, the argument will beg the question: you will find an effect on this model, so you will claim that this is an informative model. For example, if the focus is on these three RSNs and thought reporting, the authors might want to contextualize it historically, like how from two networks (DMN-antagonistic; Vanhaudenhuyse JCognNeurosci 2012; Demertzi et al, NetwNeuroci 2022) we end up to three and why this is a more suitable approach. What about whole-brain connectomic approaches, such as the work by Amico et al?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have expanded on the objectives and rationale of the study by editing/ expanding the introduction as follows (Lines 84-87):</p>
<p>“Traditionally, it was argued that the DMN was thought to have an antagonistic relationship with systems linked to external processing (Fox et al., 2005). However, according to the ‘tri-partite’ network accounts the relationship between the DMN and other brain systems is more nuanced. From this perspective key hubs of the ventral attention network, such as the anterior insula and dorso-lateral prefrontal cortex, help gate access to conscious experience, influencing regardless of the focus of attention. This is hypothesised to occur because the VAN influences interactions between the DAN, which is more important for external mental content (Corbetta and Shulman, 2002), and the DMN which is important when states (including tasks) rely more on internal representations (Smallwood et al., 2021a)..”  (… and Lines 112:125):</p>
<p>“Our current study explored whether this “tri-partite network” view of ongoing conscious thought derived from studies focused on understanding conscious experience, provides a useful organizing framework for understanding the relation between observed brain activity at rest and patterns of cognition/ personality traits. Such analysis is important because at rest there are multiple features of brain activity that can be identified via complex analyses that include regions that show patterns of coactivation (which are traditionally viewed as forming a cohesive network, (Biswal et al., 1995) as well as patterns of anti-correlation with other regions (e.g. Fox et al., 2005). However, it is unclear which of these relationships reflect aspects of cognition or behaviour or are in fact aspects of the functional organization of the cortex (Fox and Raichle, 2007). Consequently, our study builds on foundational work (e.g. Vanhaudenhuyse et al., 2011) in order to better understand which aspects of neural function observed at rest are mostly likely linked to cognition and behaviour. With this aim in mind, we examined links between macro-scale neural activation and both (i) trait descriptions of individuals and (ii) patterns of ongoing thought.”</p>

<p>- As there was no explicit description of the adopted design and the fMRI procedure, I deduced that it was about a within-subject design, 1-hour scanning session, comprised of four runs, each lasting 15 min, can that be correct? In any case, an explicit description of the design and the fMRI procedure eases the reading and replicability.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for pointing this out. We have now restructured and edited the text relating to write those details clearly and explain the MDES part of the procedure in the same section. It now reads (Lines 162:167):</p>
<p>“Resting state fMRI with Multidimensional Experience Sampling (MDES)</p>
<p>The current sample includes one hour of fully pre-processed rs-fMRI data from 144 participants (four scans from 135 participants, and three scans from nine participants whose data were missing or incomplete). The rs-fMRI was performed in four adjacent 15-minute sessions each immediately followed by MDES which retrospectively measured various dimensions of spontaneous thought during the scan.”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>- Was there a control to the analysis, such as a gradient which also associated with these characteristics? Anything else?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In our analyses we explore multiple gradients and how they link to traits and thoughts at rest. While there is no explicit control, each analyses provides a constraint on the interpretation of the other analyses. We have added the following text to expand on this point (Line 372):</p>
<p>“To this end, we performed a multiple multivariate regression with thoughts, traits, and nuisance variables (motion, age and gender) as independent variables, with whole brain functional organisation, as captured by the first three gradients, as dependent variables. In this analytic approach relationships between cognition along one gradient but not along another help identify which relationships between brain systems are mostly likely to relate to the feature of cognition in question (i.e. each gradient acts as a control for the other).”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>- I feel that Table 1 (list of tests) carries less information compared to Supplementary Table 1 (how spontaneous thought was reported and scored). I would suggest swapping them, unless Table 1 further contains which outcome measures per test were used for the analysis.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for this suggestion. Table showing the MDES questions has now been moved to the main text (Table 1, Line 194). However, as there is no other description of the questionnaires included in the main text, we have also retained the table listing personality/ trait questionnaires (Table 2, Line 200).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>- Ten group-level gradients were calculated out of which three were shown on the basis of previous work. Please, visualize all 10 gradients as complementary material to inform potential future works on how these look.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for this suggestion. Supplementary figure 3 now shows all 10 gradients.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>- Please provide more information on preprocessing, especially with motion artifacts and how the global signal was processed.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for pointing this out. We have now included the following text, summarized from Mendes et al., 2019, to describe the preprocessing in brief (Line 171:188):</p>
<p>“Motion correction parameters were derived by rigid-body realignment of the timeseries to the first (after discarding the first five volumes) volume with FSL MCFLIRT (Jenkinson et al., 2002). Parameters for distortion correction were calculated by rigidly registering a temporal mean image of this time series to the fieldmap magnitude image using FSL FLIRT (Jenkinson and Smith, 2001) which was then unwarped using FSL FUGUE (Jenkinson et al., 2012). Transformation parameters were derived by coregistering the unwarped temporal mean to the subject’s structural scan using FreeSurfer’s boundary-based registration algorithm (Greve and Fischl, 2009). All three spatial transformations were then combined and applied to each volume of the original time series in a single interpolation step. The time series was residualised against the six motion parameters, their first derivatives, “outliers” identified by Nipype’s rapidart algorithm (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://nipype.readthedocs.io/en/latest/interfaces/">https://nipype.readthedocs.io/en/latest/interfaces/</ext-link> A CompCor (Behzadi et al., 2007) approach was implemented to remove physiological noise from the residual time-series- which included first six principal components from all the voxels identified as white-matter cerebrospinal fluid. The denoised time series were temporally filtered to a frequency range between 0.01 and 0.1 Hz using FSL, mean centered and variance normalized using Nitime (Rokem et al., 2009). Imaging and pre-processing protocols are described in detail in Mendes et al (Mendes et al., 2019).”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>- Please, describe the duration of the whole process, and when the questionnaire data were collected.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We apologize for the lack of clarity. “Data” section of the Methods has now been edited to explain this more clearly, it now reads (Line 146:154):</p>
<p>“The dataset used here is part of the MPI-Leipzig Mind-Brain-Body (MPILMBB) database (Mendes et al., 2019). The complete dataset consists of a battery of selfreported personality measures, measures of spontaneous thought, task data, and structural and resting-state functional MRI (one hour, divided into four adjacent 15-min sessions) from participants between 20 and 75 years of age. Data were collected over a period of five days, with the MRI sessions always falling on day 3. The questionnaires were completed by participants before and after this day, using Limesurvey (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.limesurvey.org">https://www.limesurvey.org</ext-link>: version 2.00+) at their own convenience and using penand-paper on-site. A detailed description of the participants, measures, and data acquisition protocol has been previously published along with the dataset (Mendes et al., 2019).”</p>

<p>- In light of the discussion about sample sizes and the power of the correlations, can you indicate the effect sizes of the reported results?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for pointing this out. Effect sizes have been added to the results table (Table 3, Line 427)</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Minor corrections to the text and figures</p>
<p>- Introduction: &quot;Our sample was a cohort....states were explanatory variables&quot;: Better move this part to Methods. Ideally, provide the hypotheses here, the ways you wanted to test them, and how you would negate them. What would it mean that you got the hypotheses confirmed? What would the opposite outcome mean?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have added the following text before this part to clarify expand on the objective of the study (Lines 112:125):</p>
<p>“Our current study explored whether this “tri-partite network” view of ongoing conscious thought derived from studies focused on understanding conscious experience, provides a useful organising framework for understanding the relation between observed brain activity at rest and patterns of cognition/ personality traits. Such analysis is important because at rest there are multiple features of brain activity that can be identified via complex analyses that include regions that show patterns of coactivation (which are traditionally viewed as forming a cohesive network, (Biswal et al., 1995) as well as patterns of anti-correlation with other regions (e.g. Fox et al., 2005). However, it is unclear which of these relationships reflect aspects of cognition or behaviour or are in fact aspects of the functional organisation of the cortex (Fox and Raichle, 2007). Consequently, our study builds on foundational work (e.g. Vanhaudenhuyse et al., 2011) in order to better understand which aspects of neural function observed at rest are mostly likely linked to cognition and behaviour. With this aim in mind, we examined links between macro-scale neural activation and both (i) trait descriptions of individuals and (ii) patterns of ongoing thought.”</p>
<p>We have refrained from listing hypothesis, as the analyses we performed were data driven rather than hypothesis driven to include all possible associations between largescale connectivity patterns and individual state and trail level differences in personality and thought/ experience. We hope that the added text provides more context to understand this rationale.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>- Please, clarify whether &quot;conscious thought&quot; means &quot;reportable.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for this suggestion. We have now edited the first reference to thought patterns in the discussions to read “self-reports of ongoing thought”, instead of just “ongoing thought” (Line 432)</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>- Please, clarify whether &quot;experience&quot; and &quot;thought&quot; are used interchangeably. This is because experience can also be ineffable, beyond thought reporting.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>To clarify this in the context of the current study, we have edited first reference to “ongoing experience” in the introduction to “self-reports of ongoing experience”. (Line 75)</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>- To ease reading comprehension for each Figure, communicate the main findings first, before describing the figures.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We believe this lack of clarity is caused by including the figure reference in the heading of the results subsections. We hope this issue is fixed by editing the text in the following manner (Line 381):</p>
<p>“Trait Introversion</p>
<p>Along the first gradient, a parcel within the right orbitofrontal cortex (within the executive control network, shown in orange) showed more similarity with transmodal regions for individuals high on introversion. Six parcels within the ventral attention network, including anterior insula, operculum and cingulate cortex were closer to the somatomotor end along gradient two (shown in purple). The same regions showed lower scores along the third gradient in participants with higher introversion scores, indicating stronger integration with the default mode network. A parcel within posterior cingulate cortex (control) was also more segregated from the visual end of gradient two in participants with higher introversion scores. Associations between trait “introversion” and brain-wide activity are shown in Figure 4.”</p>
