<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Though the responses of the rich variety of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) reflect the totality of visual processing in the retina and provide the sole conduit for those processed responses to the brain, we have much to learn about how the brain uses these signals to guide behavior. An impediment to developing a comprehensive understanding of the role of retinal circuits in behavior is the paucity of causal studies in the intact primate visual system. Here we demonstrate the ability to optogenetically activate individual RGCs with flashes of light focused on single RGC somas <italic>in vivo</italic>, without activation of neighboring cells. The ability to selectively activate specific cells is the first step toward causal experiments that directly link retinal circuits to visual experience and behavior.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Though only a few classes of light-sensitive cells capture the retinal image in the primate eye, evolution has produced many more classes of retinal ganglion cell (RGC), on the order of 20, each morphologically and physiologically distinct and independently tiling the retina, to convey visual information to the brain. This dramatic expansion of cell classes in the retinal output combined with microelectrode recordings in excised tissue have made it increasingly clear that the diversity of RGCs reflects instead a surprising amount of complex early processing in the mammalian retina, processing that previously been had been thought to reside deeper in the brain (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Gollisch and Meister, 2010</xref></italic></bold>). There is evidence, for example, for specialized circuits that convey directional selectivity(<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Barlow et al., 1964</xref></italic></bold>), segregate object from background motion(<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Lettvin et al., 1959</xref></italic></bold>), and anticipate moving stimuli(<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Berry et al., 1999</xref></italic></bold>). However, we remain uncertain about the direct functional role of these RGC classes because, while ex vivo recordings can characterize the specific stimulus requirements of RGC classes, they are often made in the excised retina that is detached from the downstream visual pathways they serve. Such studies preclude direct manipulations of RGC activity to observe the impact on visual experience or behavior in the awake primate. For example, we cannot say with certainty whether the DS cells recently observed in the non-human primate (NHP) are involved in eye movements, the perceptual experience of motion, or both. In-deed, there is even lingering controversy about the perceptual roles of the most common primate RGCs, the midget and parasol ganglion cells (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Freedland and Rieke, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Patterson et al., 2019</xref></italic></bold>).</p>
<p>To address these controversies, one exciting possibility for the future is the development of studies in which the effect of manipulating RGC responses in the awake behaving animal can be measured with psychophysical or behavioral measures. There have been formidable challenges to deploying this causal paradigm to study retinal circuits because of their inaccessibility inside the moving eye of the awake behaving primate. Advances in high resolution retinal imaging with adaptive optics now make it possible to observe single RGCs in the living eye (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Gray et al., 2008</xref></italic></bold>). AO has also enabled very accurate eye tracking, making it possible to not only image but also stimulate single photoreceptors repeatedly with focused flashes of light (<bold><italic>Schmidt et al., 2018a</italic></bold>,b; <bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Tuten et al., 2017</xref></italic></bold>) in the moving human eye. In addition, viral vectors now allow expression of calcium indicators such as GCaMP6s (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Yin et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Godat et al., 2022</xref></italic></bold>) enabling recording from single RGCs <italic>in vivo</italic>. Finally, optogenetic activation of RGCs has been demonstrated in both macaque (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">McGregor et al., 2020</xref></italic></bold>) and human (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Sahel et al., 2021</xref></italic></bold>) retina <italic>in vivo</italic>. These recent technical advances taken together now offer the possibility of causal experiments in which single RGCs are optogenetically stimulated in the living primate eye while the behavioral consequences are measured. Here, we demonstrate the first step toward establishing this capability: showing successful stimulation of single RGCs in the living primate eye.</p>

<title>Results and Discussion</title>
<p>The selected cells and their fluorescence traces can be seen in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>. These recordings were transformed into z-scores using means and standard deviations acquired earlier in the session where no stimulus was present. All targeted cells showed large responses to the optogenetic probe, while the non-targeted cells showed no significant response. Even those non-targeted cells closest to the probe show responses within the normal range. There is no evidence their responses are elevated relative to more distant cells as would be expected if optical cross talk were eliciting responses from nearby cells. <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> shows all cells’ ΔF/F values plotted against their distance from the targeted cell. These data indicate that only the targeted cell is being activated by the optogenetic stimulus.</p>

<p>Here we show that it is possible to excite individual RGCs expressing an optogenetic actuator in the living monkey eye. When cells are chosen that have especially large separation from their nearest neighbors, this excitation can be achieved without simultaneously stimulating nearby cells. Additional experiments will be required to determine the degree of optical selectivity that can be achieved at slightly larger eccentricities where the RGCs are more densely packed and stacked many cells deep. One approach to reducing the crosstalk problem would be to target a subset of RGC classes with retrograde injections into brain regions that receive a more sparse RGC input from retina. It could also be reduced were it possible to develop viral vectors specific to a particular RGC class. The demonstration of <italic>in vivo</italic> selective activation of individual RGCs lays a possible foundation for future causal studies of RGC function. Such experiments would involve, for example, first, <italic>in vivo</italic> calcium imaging to classify each RGC, followed by psychophysical experiments combined with optogenetic stimulation designed to explore each cell’s role in visual behavior. Such experiments would establish a direct link between activation of an individual RGC and visual behavior. Such experiments could help determine whether a given cell class contributes to perceptual experience, subconscious visual behavior, or both. These experiments will face additional challenges such as deploying the technology demonstrated here in the awake behaving animal where eye motion will be larger than in the anesthetized animal. Nonetheless, the single cone tracking and stimulation experiments in the awake human inspire confidence that this will be possible (<bold><italic>Schmidt et al., 2018a</italic></bold>,b; <bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Tuten et al., 2017</xref></italic></bold>).</p>
<p>The causal experimental approach has been successful in understanding the roles of neuronal classes in cortex of NHPs for many years, such as the work of Newsome and colleagues who showed that electrical activation of directional selective cells in MT modifies the animal’s choices in motion discrimination tasks (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Salzman et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Cicmil and Krug, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Parker and Newsome, 1998</xref></italic></bold>). More recently, this paradigm has incorporated optogenetic activation to investigate the function role of localized neural circuitry in cortex. For example, Jazayeri <italic>et al</italic>. directly activated neurons in the primate V1 to demonstrate their relationship to gaze position<bold><italic>Jazayeri et al</italic></bold>. (<bold><italic>2012</italic></bold>). Soma <italic>et al</italic>. applied the technique to motor control, activating posterior parietal and motor cortex neurons to bias limb movements(<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Soma et al., 2019</xref></italic></bold>)</p>
<p>In future experiments that will use this approach we will need to demonstrate if the activation of a single RGC can be detected psychophysically in a monkey model. Monkeys are remarkably good at psychophysical experiments, with performance rivalling that of human observers(<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Matsuno and Fujita, 2009</xref></italic></bold>). Moreover, analogous experiments in which single cones are targeted with light have shown that visibility can be measured from photon absorption with flashes of light delivered through adaptive optics to single cones from each of the three foveal cone classes(<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Williams et al., 1981</xref>; Schmidt et al., 2018b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Hofer et al., 2005</xref></italic></bold>). Indeed, the somas of RGCs are substantially easier to selectively target because they are more than five times larger than the cones successfully targeted in these prior experiments.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the interpretation of causal experiments through optogenetic stimulation of a single RGC is inevitably complicated by the fact that perceptual experience depends on populations cells and the role of any cell in perception will necessary depend on the signals of its neighbors. Neighboring RGCs with overlapping receptive fields to that of the RGC in question will typically not be signalling in the manner is which they normally would. How the brain would interpret such an unusual pattern of excitation is not entirely clear and it may be necessary to control the stimulation of multiple nearby RGCs to develop a clear understanding of their function. Additionally, should it prove possible to realize this paradigm, it could provide valuable data to guide optogenetics-based vision restoration therapies. This could eventually offer the opportunity to instill responses in individual classes of RGCs that lead to a perceptual experience that more closely resembles that generated by the natural environment in the sighted eye.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="s3a">
<title>Animals and Animal Care</title>
<p>These experiments were performed in two anesthetized <italic>macaca fascicularis</italic>, one male (M1) and one female (M2). Macaques were housed in an AAALAC accredited facility and were provided with care by 4 full time veterinarians, 5 veterinary technicians, and an animal behaviorist from the Department of Comparative Medicine. The animal care staff monitored each animal for signs of discomfort at least twice daily. They were caged in pairs and had free access to lab chow and water. Their diet was additionally supplemented with daily treats including dried fruits, fresh fruits, vegetables, and nuts. All animals have daily access to enrichment items such as puzzle feeders and mirrors, and are provided with movies and/or music. More novel enrichment items such as treat filled bags, snow, or forage boxes were provided weekly. The macaques had access to a large play space with swings and perches on a rotating basis. This study was carried out in strict accordance with the Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology (ARVO) Statement for the Use of Animals and the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health. One animal had two lesions of the central fovea, which had removed cone input to many of the labeled RGCs. The RGCs deafferented in this manner are easily distinguishable from those with normal input, and were avoided for study in this experiment.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s3b">
<title>Injections for Expression of Optogenetic and Calcium Indicator</title>
<p>Prior to injection, both animals received daily subcutaneous injections of cyclosporine to reduce the possibility of immune reaction to the injection. Blood trough levels were monitored to titrate the dose into the range of 150-200 ng/ml, and these levels were maintained throughout the testing period. The ocular surface was disinfected before injection with 50% diluted Betadine. Coexpression of both an optogenetic actuator (ChrimsonR) and a calcium indicator (GCaMP6s) enabled both stimulation of RGCs and recording of their responses. This was achieved with a single intravitreal injection containing a mixture of two adeno-associated virus (AAV2) based vectors with a ubiquitous CAG promoter, AAV2-CAG-tdTomato-ChrimsonR and AAV2-CAG-GCaMP6s. These vectors were synthesized by the University of Pennsylvania Vector core. The injection was delivered via a 30 gauge needle with a tuberculin syringe into the middle of the vitreous roughly 2 mm behind the limbus. The injection was made in the right eye of M1 and the left eye of M2, and had a total volume of 75 μL. Post-injection, the eyes were monitored with conventional SLO imaging (Heidelberg Spectralis) for adverse events such as inflammation, which was not present in either animal throughout data collection. As previously demonstrated (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Dalkara et al., 2013</xref></italic></bold>), expression was largely confined to an annulus spanning from 0.5° to 2°. The inner edge of this annular region corresponds to the most centrally located RGCs that receive input from the most central fovea, while the outer edge corresponds to the most eccentric location where we presume the inner limiting membrane remained thin enough for penetration of the viral vector. All RGCs that obtained expression are close enough to the foveal center to be displaced from their receptive fields, allowing for direct optogenetic activation of cell somas without stimulation of the cones that drive them.</p>

<sec id="s3c1">
<title>Anesthesia and Animal Preparation</title>
<p>Anesthesia and animal preparation were performed by licensed veterinary technicians. Macaques were fasted overnight prior to anesthesia in preparation for ventilation. The morning of an imaging session, macaques were moved to the laboratory and anesthetized with isoflurane. They were placed prone upon a stereotaxic cart, supported by cushions and covered with a warming blanket. The animals were paralyzed for the duration of imaging via an injection of vecuronium bromide. For the duration of paralysis, the animal’s heart and respiratory rates, blood oxygenation levels, and electrocardiogram were monitored by a veterinary technician. The animal’s pupils were dilated with drops of phenylephrine chloride (2.5%) and Tropicamide (1%), and the eye fitted with a rigid gas permeable contact lens to maintain corneal hydration. The animal’s head was stabilized with ear bars and a chin rest, and the animal’s whole body could be rotated via the stereotaxic cart to position the animal for imaging. The macaque was monitored for several hours by a veterinary technician after each session to ensure full and safe recovery from the anesthetic drugs. This procedure was repeated no more than once per week on an individual macaque.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s3c2">
<title>Imaging Procedure</title>
<p>High resolution imaging was performed with an adaptive optics scanning light ophthalmoscope (AOSLO), a complete description of which can be found in (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Godat et al., 2022</xref></italic></bold>). A Shack-Hartmann wavefront sensor in conjunction with an 847 nm laser diode source (QPhotonics) was used for wavefront sensing. The wavefront sensor data controlled a deformable mirror (ALPAO) in a closed-loop configuration operating at 10 Hz to provide correction of ocular aberrations. Reflectance and fluorescence signals were collected with photomultiplier tubes. The RGC layer was imaged using the fluorescent light emitted by the calcium indicator excited with light from a 488 nm laser (Qiop-tiq), and the optogenetic was excited using the 640 nm line of a multi-line laser (Toptica). The cone mosaic was simultaneously imaged with light from a a 796 nm superluminescent diode (Superlum) to provide a higher SNR helpful for both real-time stimulus stabilization and post-recording image registration. Both uses are based upon cross-correlation of small strips of the image (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Yang et al., 2014</xref></italic></bold>). For stimulus stabilization, only strips located near the stimulus’ intended location were used in the cross correlation, allowing the stimulus to be repeatedly presented to the same retinal location. This stabilization is necessary because the heart beat and respiration of the animal cause lateral shifts in the retinal imaging throughout recording of approximately 50 μm. The image registration application is similar in execution and is applied in turn to all sections of the image to obtain a single stabilized video. The motion data from the strip registration of the cone reflectance video was used to stabilize the calcium recording. These methods allowed us to obtain cellular-scale recordings from the primate retina in vivo while correcting for the motion inherent to the living eye.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s3c3">
<title>Cell selection</title>
<p>For this first study, we selected RGCs lying on the innermost edge of the annulus of expression often had large distances between their somas, making them easier to target with optogenetic stimulation without exciting neighboring cells. This crosstalk could potentially enter our measurements both when stimulating and recording. First, scatter from the 640 nm stimulus may illuminate nearby cell somas or underlying fibers of passage. Additionally, these nearby cell somas, their dendritic arbors, and fibers may contaminate the GCaMP recording if they overlap with the cell of interest’s soma. We chose cells two cells in each of the two animals that were &gt; 20 μm from their the nearest neighbor to mitigate the possibility of optical crosstalk. Optical crosstalk presents a possible issue because of the overlap between the 488 nm excitation light and our fluorophores’ emission spectra, with the absorption spectrum of ChrimsonR. The relevant spectra are shown in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>. There is significant overlap between the emission wavelengths of our fluorophores and the absorption spectrum of ChrimsonR. The 488 nm imaging light provides a static stimulus to each cell, and does not preclude selectively activating one RGC via the optogenetic probe. We estimate that the emission from GCaMP and tdTomato is at least 4 orders of magnitude lower than this static stimulus, making it unlikely that these caused a significant cell response. Cells within a 1°x1° field of view were imaged at 488 nm (25 μW) for 30 seconds to allow for adaptation to the maintained calcium imaging light. ChrimsonR was then activated by a circular stimulus (640 nm, 750 μW) with a diameter of 12.5 μm, approximately the size of a cell soma. This stimulus was formed by modulating the 640 nm laser source’s output to only be on while scanning over the soma of interest at a rate of 25 Hz. The duration of excitation was 800 ms, throughout which the stimulus was stabilized on the cell’s soma using the method describe in the imaging procedure section. This stimulus was repeated four times for each trial with a waiting period of 15 seconds between stimuli.</p>

<title>Analysis</title>
<p>Analysis The GCaMP6s recordings were registered using strip registration and the frames averaged to obtain a high SNR image of the RGC mosaic. This registration is necessary because the heart beat and respiration of the animal cause lateral shifts in the retinal imaging throughout recording of approximately 50 μm. The resulting RGC image was manually segmented to create a binary mask that can be applied to each frame of the video. The mask is used to extract the mean brightness of each cell soma for each frame. These brightness values are then used to calculate ΔF/F values for each cell soma in response to each stimulus. This calculation was performed for all cells that remain within the field of view for the entirety of the recording. Cells near the edge of the field of view often move in and out of visibility, obscuring any signals that may be present. The mean and standard deviation of ΔF/F values are calculated for periods during which no stimulus was present using data taken from all labeled RGCs in the subject’s retina. These are used to transform the cell responses to stimuli into z-scores.</p>

<p>Summary</p>
<p>
This manuscript reports preliminary evidence of successful optogenetic activation of single retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) through the eye of a living monkey using adaptive optics (AO).</p>
<p>Strengths</p>
<p>
The eventual goals of this line of research have enormous potential impact in that they will probe the perceptual impact of activating single RGCs. While I think more data should be included, the four examples shown look quite convincing.</p>
<p>Weaknesses</p>
<p>
While this is undoubtedly a technical achievement and an important step along this group's stated goal to measure the perceptual consequences of single-RGC activations, the presentation lacks the rigor that I would expect from what is really a methods paper. In my view, it is perfectly reasonable to publish the details of a method before it has yielded any new biological insights, but in those publications, there is a higher burden to report the methodological details, full data sets, calibrations, and limitations of the method. There is considerable room for improvement in reporting those aspects. Specifically, more raw data should be shown for activations of neighboring RGCs to pinpoint the actual resolution of the technique, and more than two cells (one from each field of view) should be tested. Some information about the density of labeled RGCs in these animals would also be helpful to provide context for how many well-isolated target cells exist per animal.</p>

<p>This proof-of-principle study lays important groundwork for future studies. Murphy et al. expressed ChrimsonR and GCaMP6s in retinal ganglion cells of a living macaque. They recorded calcium responses and stimulated individual cells, optically. Neurons targeted for stimulation were activated strongly whereas neighboring neurons were not.</p>
<p>The ability to record from neuronal populations while simultaneously stimulating a subset in a controlled way is a high priority for systems neuroscience, and this has been particularly challenging in primates. This study marks an important milestone in the journey towards this goal.</p>
<p>The ability to detect stimulation of single RGCs was presumably due to the smallness of the light spot and the sparsity of transduction. Can the authors comment on the importance of the latter factor for their results? Is it possible that the stimulation protocol activated neurons nearby the targeted neuron that did not express GCaMP? Is it possible that off-target neurons near the targeted neuron expressed GCaMP, and were activated, but too weakly to produce a detectable GCaMP signal? In general, simply knowing that off-target signals were undetectable is not enough; knowing something about the threshold for the detection of off-target signals under the conditions of this experiment is critical.</p>
<p>Minor comments:</p>
<p>
Did the lights used to stimulate and record from the retina excite RGCs via the normal light-sensing pathway? Were any such responses recorded? What was their magnitude?</p>
<p>The data presented attest to a lack of crosstalk between targeted and neighboring cells. It is therefore surprising that lines 69-72 are dedicated to methods for &quot;reducing the crosstalk problem&quot;. More information should be provided regarding the magnitude of this problem under the current protocol/instrumentation and the techniques that were used to circumvent it to obtain the data presented.</p>
<p>Optical crosstalk could be spatial or spectral. Laying out this distinction plainly could help the reader understand the issues quickly. The Methods indicate that cells were chosen on the basis that they were &gt; 20 µm from their nearest (well-labeled) neighbor to mitigate optical crosstalk, but the following sentence is about spectral overlap.</p>
<p>Figure 2 legend: &quot;...even the nearby cell somas do not show significantly elevated response (p &gt;&gt; 0.05, unpaired t-test) than other cells at more distant locations.&quot; This sentence does not indicate how some cells were classified as &quot;nearby&quot; whereas others were classified as being &quot;at more distant locations&quot;. Perhaps a linear regression would be more appropriate than an unpaired t-test here.</p>
<p>Line 56: &quot;These recordings were... acquired earlier in the session where no stimulus was present.&quot; More information should be provided regarding the conditions under which this baseline was obtained. I assume that the ChrimsonR-activating light was off and the 488 nm-GCaMP excitation light was on, but this was not stated explicitly. Were any other lights on (e.g. room lights or cone-imaging lights)? If there was no spatial component to the baseline measurement, &quot;where&quot; should be &quot;when&quot;.</p>
<p>Please add a scalebar to Figure 1a to facilitate comparison with Figure 2.</p>
<p>Lines 165-173: Was the 488 nm light static or 10 Hz-modulated? The text indicates that GCaMP was excited with a 488 nm light and data were acquired using a scanning light ophthalmoscope, but line 198 says that &quot;the 488 nm imaging light provides a static stimulus&quot;.</p>
<p>A potential application of this technology is for the study of visually guided behavior in awake macaques. This is an exciting prospect. With that in mind, a useful contribution of this report would be a frank discussion of the hurdles that remain for such application (in addition to eye movements, which are already discussed).</p>

<p>This paper reports a considerable technical achievement: the optogenetic activation of single retinal ganglion cells in vivo in monkeys. As clearly specified in the paper, this is an important step towards causal tests of the role of specific ganglion cell types in visual perception. Yet this methodological advance is not described currently in sufficient detail to replicate or evaluate. The paper could be improved substantially by including additional methodological details. Some specific suggestions follow.</p>
<p>The start of the results needs a paragraph or more to outline how you got to Figure 1. Figure 1 itself lacks scale bars, and it is unclear, for example, that the ganglion cells targeted are in the foveal slope.</p>
<p>The text mentions the potential difficulties targeting ganglion cells at larger eccentricities where the soma density increases. If this is something that you have tried it would be nice to include some of that data (whether or not selective activation was possible). Related to this point, it would be helpful to include a summary of the ganglion cell density in monkey retina.</p>
<p>Related to the point in the previous paragraph - do you have any experiments in which you systematically moved the stimulation spot away from the target ganglion cell to directly test the dependence of stimulation on distance? This would be a valuable addition to the paper.</p>
<p>The activity in Figure 1 recovers from activation very slowly - much more slowly than the light response of these cells, and much more slowly than the activity elicited in most optogenetic studies. Can you quantify this time course and comment on why it might be so slow?</p>
<p>Traces from non-targeted cells should be shown in Figure 1 along with those of targeted cells.</p>
