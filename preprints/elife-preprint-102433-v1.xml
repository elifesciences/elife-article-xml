<title>Abstract</title><p>In the clinic, anti-tumor angiogenesis is commonly employed for treating recurrent, metastatic, drug-resistant triple-negative and advanced breast cancer. Our previous research revealed that the deubiquitinase STAMBPL1 enhances the stability of MKP-1, thereby promoting cisplatin resistance in breast cancer. In this study, we discovered that STAMBPL1 could upregulate the expression of the hypoxia-inducible factor HIF1α in breast cancer cells. Therefore, we investigated whether STAMBPL1 promotes tumor angiogenesis. We demonstrated that STAMBPL1 increased <italic>HIF1A</italic> transcription in a non-enzymatic manner, thereby activating the HIF1α/VEGFA signaling pathway to facilitate TNBC angiogenesis. Through RNA-seq analysis, we identified the transcription factor GRHL3 as a downstream target of STAMBPL1 that is responsible for mediating <italic>HIF1A</italic> transcription. Furthermore, we discovered that STAMBPL1 regulates <italic>GRHL3</italic> transcription by interacting with the transcription factor FOXO1. These findings shed light on the role and mechanism of STAMBPL1 in the pathogenesis of breast cancer, offering novel targets and avenues for the treatment of triple-negative and advanced breast cancer.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a subtype of breast cancer characterized by a lack of expression of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). Despite representing only 10–15% of all breast cancer cases, it is associated with a greater risk of recurrence, metastasis, and resistance to chemotherapy, leading to a poorer prognosis than other types of breast cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. Therefore, understanding the pathogenesis of this subtype of breast cancer and identifying effective treatment targets are key areas of research focus and challenge. In the clinic, in addition to surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy, treatment approaches for TNBC also include the use of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors, poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors, immune checkpoint inhibitors, and anti-angiogenic therapies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>For solid tumors, the survival, proliferation, and invasion of cancer cells rely on surrounding blood vessels to provide nutrients and oxygen. Cancer cells can increase the synthesis and secretion of the vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA), activate endothelial cells in neighboring blood vessels through paracrine pathways, and stimulate tumor angiogenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>. Therefore, investigating the upstream molecular mechanisms that activate VEGFA in cancer cells offers new targets for inhibiting TNBC angiogenesis via disruption of this signaling pathway.</p>
<p>The deubiquitinase STAMBPL1 (also known as AMSH-LP) belongs to the AMSH family and cleaves K63-linked polyubiquitin chains<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. STAMBPL1 stabilizes XIAP to inhibit apoptosis in prostate cancer cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup> and confers resistance to honokiol-induced apoptosis in various cancer cell types by stabilizing Survivin and c-FLIP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. Our previous research demonstrated that STAMBPL1 enhances cisplatin resistance in TNBC cells through the stabilization of MKP-1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. In this study, we discovered that, independent of its deubiquitinating enzyme activity, STAMBPL1 upregulates HIF1α expression in TNBC cells. We aimed to investigate the molecular mechanism by which it upregulates HIF1α and explore its role in tumor angiogenesis in TNBC.</p>
<p>FOXO1, a member of the forkhead box transcription factor family, regulates various physiological and pathological processes, such as cell proliferation, apoptosis, autophagy, and oxidative stress<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>. In breast cancer, FOXO1 enhances the stemness of cancer cells by promoting <italic>SOX2</italic> transcription<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup> and confers resistance to chemotherapy drugs in basal-like breast cancer cells by activating <italic>KLF5</italic> transcription<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. Furthermore, FOXO1 plays a crucial role in angiogenesis by upregulating VEGFA transcription<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. However, the specific mechanism by which FOXO1 regulates VEGFA transcription remains unclear, and its role in tumor angiogenesis in TNBC requires further investigation.</p>
<p>In this study, we discovered that STAMBPL1 facilitates the transcriptional regulation of <italic>GRHL3</italic> by interacting with FOXO1, consequently enhancing <italic>HIF1A</italic> transcription through GRHL3 to activate the HIF1α/VEGFA pathway. This results in increased endothelial cell activity via paracrine signaling, thereby promoting tumor angiogenesis in TNBC.</p>

<title>Cell proliferation and migration assays</title>
<p>To detect the proliferation of HUVECs, we used the Click-iT™ EdU Alexa Fluor™ 647 Imaging Kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly, HUVECs were seeded on coverslips (BD Biosciences) at 0.5×10<sup>5</sup> cells per well. The next day, the supernatants were discarded, and the cells were cultured with conditioned medium (CM). Six hours later, the cells were incubated with EdU in CM for 4 hours, followed by fixation and staining. For each sample, three random fields were observed via fluorescence microscopy, and the total numbers of cells and EdU-positive cells were counted. To detect the migration of HUVECs, we performed a wound-healing assay. Twenty-four hours after seeding, the supernatants of the HUVECs were discarded, and the cells were scratched and cultured with CM for 24 hours. Wound closure was imaged via microscopy. For each image, the gap width was analyzed via ImageJ.</p>

<title>Immunofluorescence staining</title>
<p>HEK293T cells plated on cell culture slides were transfected with the STAMBPL1 and FOXO1 expression plasmids. Two days after transfection, the cells were fixed in 3.7% polyformaldehyde at 4°C overnight. After being blocked with 5% BSA at room temperature for 1 hour, the cells were stained with anti-STAMBPL1 (mouse) and anti-FOXO1 (rabbit) antibodies at 4°C overnight. The cells were subsequently stained with both an Alexa Fluor647-labeled anti-mouse secondary antibody and a FITC-labeled anti-rabbit secondary antibody (ZSGB-Bio, Beijing, China) at room temperature for 1 hour. Nuclei were stained with DAPI (Biosharp, BL739A) for 15 min. Images were captured via a confocal microscope.</p>

<title>Immunoprecipitation and GST pull-down</title>
<p>For endogenous protein interaction, cell lysates were first incubated with anti-FOXO1 antibodies or rabbit IgG (2729S; Cell Signaling Technology) and then incubated with protein A/G magnetic beads (HY-K0202; MCE). For the GST pull-down assay, the cell lysates were directly incubated with Glutathione Sepharose 4B (10312185; Cytiva) overnight at 4°C. For the IP-Flag assay, cell lysates were directly incubated with anti-Flag magnetic beads (HY-K0207; MCE) overnight at 4°C. The precipitates were washed four times with 1 ml of lysis buffer, boiled for 10 minutes with 1×SDS sample buffer, and subjected to WB analysis.</p>

<title>Xenograft experiments</title>
<p>We purchased 5- to 6-week-old female BALB/c nude mice from SLACCAS (Changsha, China). Animal feeding and experiments were approved by the animal ethics committee of Kunming Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences. HCC1806-shLuc, HCC1806-shSTAMBPL1, or HCC1806-shGRHL3 cells and HCC1806-PCDH-Vector or HCC1806-PCDH-STAMBPL1 cells (1 × 10<sup>6</sup> in Matrigel (BD Biosciences, NY, USA)) were implanted into the mammary fat pads of the mice. When the tumor volume reached approximately 50 mm<sup>3</sup>, the nude mice were randomly assigned to the control or treatment groups (n = 4/group). The control group was given vehicle alone, and the treatment group received the FOXO1 inhibitor AS1842856 (10 mg/kg), the VEGFR inhibitor apatinib (50 mg/kg), and the FOXO1 inhibitor AS1842856 combined with the VEGFR inhibitor apatinib via intragastric administration every two days for 20 days. The tumor volume was calculated as follows: tumor volume was calculated by the formula (π × length × width<sup>2</sup>)/6. The maximal tumor size permitted by the animal ethics committee of Kunming Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, and the maximal tumor size in this study was not exceeded.</p>

<title>STAMBPL1 upregulates HIF1α in a non-enzymatic manner in TNBC cells</title>
<p>Our previous research revealed that STAMBPL1, a deubiquitinase, promotes cisplatin resistance in TNBC by stabilizing MKP1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. To further investigate the role and mechanism of STAMBPL1 in TNBC, we discovered that the knockdown of STAMBPL1 can inhibit hypoxia-induced HIF1α expression (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>) and suppress the transcription of the HIF1α downstream genes <italic>VEGFA</italic> and <italic>GLUT1</italic> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B-E</xref>). Under normoxic conditions, both STAMBPL1 and its enzymatically mutated variant (E292A) can upregulate the protein expression of HIF1α (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F</xref>). These findings suggest that STAMBPL1 enhances the expression of HIF1α in breast cancer cells through a non-DUB enzyme activity mechanism.</p>

<p>Our previous study demonstrated that STAMBPL1 is localized in the nucleus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>.

Therefore, we aimed to investigate whether STAMBPL1 promotes GRHL3 transcription via FOXO1.

Through the generation of a series of Flag-FOXO1/GST-fused STAMBPL1 deletion mutants, we mapped the regions of the proteins responsible for this interaction (SFig. 5F‒G). The results of the GST pulldown assay indicated that the N-terminus (1–140 aa) of STAMBPL1 interacted with FOXO1 (SFig. 5H). Additionally, an immunoprecipitation assay revealed an interaction between the FOXO1 protein (250–596 aa) and STAMBPL1 (SFig. 5I).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we discovered that STAMBPL1 promotes angiogenesis in TNBC by activating the HIF1α/VEGFA pathway independently of its enzymatic activity. Through RNA-seq analysis, we revealed that STAMBPL1 positively regulates the transcription of <italic>GRHL3</italic>. Furthermore, we demonstrated that GRHL3 binds to the promoter of the <italic>HIF1A</italic> gene, thereby increasing its transcription. Additionally, we found that STAMBPL1 interacts with FOXO1 to facilitate the transcription of GRHL3/HIF1α/VEGFA. Importantly, we confirmed that the combination of the FOXO1 inhibitor AS1842856 and the VEGFR inhibitor apatinib effectively inhibited tumor growth in nude mice. These findings suggest that both STAMBPL1 and FOXO1 may be potential therapeutic targets for inhibiting angiogenesis in TNBC. This study is the first to uncover the role of STAMBPL1 in promoting angiogenesis through the FOXO1/GRHL3/HIF1α axis. Furthermore, a novel transcription factor, GRHL3, which regulates the transcription of HIF1α, was identified. These findings provide valuable insights for developing new therapeutic strategies to target TNBC.</p>
<p>The role of STAMBPL1 in tumors has not been fully recognized. Recent studies have reported its involvement in the epithelial‒mesenchymal transition of various cancers, and its absence has been shown to affect the mesenchymal phenotype of lung and breast cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. Our previous research demonstrated that STAMBPL1 can stabilize MKP1 through deubiquitination and that the deletion of STAMBPL1 and MKP1 increases the sensitivity of breast cancer cells to cisplatin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>, suggesting that STAMBPL1 may be a potential therapeutic target for breast cancer. However, the mechanism by which STAMBPL1 activates the transcriptional activity of FOXO1 has not been elucidated, as STAMBPL1 does not stabilize the FOXO1 protein through its deubiquitinating enzyme activity. We speculate that STAMBPL1 may recruit other coactivators to FOXO1 transcription complexes. It will be important to develop a <italic>Stambpl1</italic> knockout mouse model to investigate the exact role of STAMBPL1 in TNBC. Additionally, we need to develop HIF1α and FOXO1 antibodies suitable for immunohistochemistry to detect their expression in TNBC clinical samples.</p>
<p>Several studies have reported that FOXO1 inhibits tumor angiogenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. Studies have shown that M2 macrophage-derived exosomal miR-942 promotes the migration and invasion of lung adenocarcinoma cells and facilitates angiogenesis by binding to FOXO1 to alleviate the inhibition of β-catenin, in which the upregulation of FOXO1 induces a decrease in cell invasion and angiogenesis <italic>in vitro</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. FOXO1 inhibits gastric cancer growth and angiogenesis under hypoxic conditions via inactivation of the HIF1α-VEGF pathway, possibly in association with SIRT1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. Cancer-associated fibroblast (CAF)-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) deliver miR-135b-5p into colorectal adenocarcinoma cells to downregulate FOXO1 and promote HUVEC proliferation, migration, and angiogenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. Colorectal cancer cell-derived exosomes overexpressing miR-183-5p promote the proliferation, migration and tube formation of HMEC-1 (human microvascular endothelial cells) cells through the inhibition of FOXO1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. Bladder cancer cell-derived exosomal miR-1247-3p facilitates angiogenesis by inhibiting FOXO1 expression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. However, the role of FOXO1 in breast cancer angiogenesis has not been studied, and our study revealed that FOXO1 can promote the expression of HIF1α and VEGFA, suggesting that it may play a role in promoting angiogenesis in breast cancer.</p>
<p>Studies have demonstrated that the AKT‒FOXO1 signaling pathway regulates the expression of GRHL3. To investigate this, the researchers utilized a previously published ChIP-seq dataset for FOXO1 from human endometrial stromal cells. They reported that FOXO1 occupied BRD4-bound enhancers near the <italic>GRHL3</italic> gene. The authors subsequently confirmed that the removal of EGF and insulin from the growth medium significantly increased the expression of GRHL3, but the administration of the FOXO1 inhibitor AS1842856 partially blocked the induced expression of GRHL3<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>. These results suggest that FOXO1 plays a regulatory role upstream of GRHL3, and our study also confirmed that FOXO1 promotes the transcription of <italic>GRHL3</italic> by binding to its promoter.</p>
<p>GRHL3 is a highly conserved epidermal-specific developmental transcription factor that has recently gained attention in the field of cancer research<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>. To date, only a few genes regulated by GRHL3 have been identified. Studies have shown that GRHL3 levels are significantly reduced in human skin and head and neck squamous cell carcinomas and suggest that GRHL3 is a key tumor suppressor pathway in squamous cell carcinomas<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>. GRHL3 was also found to be induced by TNF-α in the mammary carcinoma cell line MCF-7 and was identified as a TNFα-induced endothelial cell migration factor with promigratory activity as high as that of VEGF<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>. However, the specific role of GRHL3 in breast cancer is unclear. Studies have confirmed that GRHL3 strongly stimulates endothelial cell migration, which is consistent with an angiogenic, protumorigenic function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>. In our study, we demonstrated that GRHL3 promotes TNBC angiogenesis. HIF1α, a known regulator of angiogenesis, is regulated by growth factors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>, cytokines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup> and mitogens<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>. The EGFR/Akt pathway is a known positive regulator of HIF1α, potentially through mTOR<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup> or independent of it<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>. While the mechanisms regulating HIFα protein expression have been extensively studied, those modulating HIF1α transcriptional activity remain unclear. Our study reveals for the first time that GRHL3 promotes transcriptional activity by binding to the promoter of the <italic>HIF1α</italic> gene.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>In summary, STAMBPL1 promoted TNBC angiogenesis by activating the GRHL3/HIF1A pathway via FOXO1 in a non-enzymatic manner. These findings highlight the significant role of STAMBPL1 in TNBC angiogenesis and suggest that targeting the STAMBL1/FOXO1/GRHL3/HIF1α/VEGFA axis could be a potential therapeutic strategy to inhibit angiogenesis in TNBC.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
In this study by Fang et al., the authors show how STAMBPL1 promotes TNBC angiogenesis via a feed-forward GRHL3/HIF1a/VEGFA axis. They demonstrate that STAMBPL1 interacts with FOXO1, define the required domains in each protein, and illustrate that this interaction facilitates FOXO1 transcriptional factor activity, which then activating GRHL3/HIF1a/VEGFA signaling. Lastly, they show that the combination of VEGFR and FOXO1 inhibitors can synergistically suppress STAMBPL1-overexpressing TNBC.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The manuscript is clearly written, and the results are well explained. The observation that STAMBPL1 mediates GRHL3 transcription through its interaction with FOXO1 is novel. The findings also have important translational potential.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
The mechanism by which STAMBPL1 mediates GRHL3 transcription through its interaction with FOXO1 is not sufficiently discussed, especially in relation to how STAMBPL1 regulates FOXO1. Some reported effects are modest.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
In their manuscript, Fang and colleagues make a notable contribution to the field of oncology, particularly in advancing our understanding of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). The research delineates the role of STAMBPL1 in promoting angiogenesis in TNBC through its interaction with FOXO1 and the subsequent activation of the GRHL3/HIF1A/VEGFA axis. The evidence presented is robust, with a combination of in vitro experiments, RNA sequencing, and in vivo studies providing a comprehensive view of the molecular mechanisms at play. The strength of the evidence is anchored in the systematic approach and the utilization of multiple methodologies to substantiate the findings.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
The manuscript presents a methodologically robust framework, incorporating RNA-sequencing, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays, and a suite of in vitro and in vivo model systems, which collectively substantiate the claims regarding the pro-angiogenic role of STAMBPL1 in TNBC. The employment of multiple cellular models, conditioned media to assess HUVEC functional responses, and xenograft tumor models in murine hosts offers a comprehensive evaluation of STAMBPL1's impact on angiogenic processes.A salient strength of this work is the identification of GRHL3 as a transcriptional target of STAMBPL1 and the demonstration of a physical interaction between STAMBPL1 and FOXO1, which modulates GRHL3-driven HIF1A transcription. The study further suggests a potential therapeutic strategy by revealing the synergistic inhibitory effects of combined VEGFR and FOXO1 inhibitor treatment on TNBC tumor growth.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
A potential limitation of the study is the reliance on specific cellular and animal models, which may constrain the extrapolation of these findings to the broader spectrum of human TNBC biology. Furthermore, while the study provides evidence for a novel regulatory axis involving STAMBPL1, FOXO1, and GRHL3, the multifaceted nature of angiogenesis may implicate additional regulatory factors not exhaustively addressed in this research.</p>
<p>Appraisal of Achievement and Conclusion Support:</p>
<p>
The authors have successfully demonstrated that STAMBPL1 promotes HIF1A transcription and activates the HIF1α/VEGFA axis in a non-enzymatic manner, leading to increased angiogenesis in TNBC. The results are generally supportive of their conclusions, with clear evidence that STAMBPL1 upregulates HIF1α expression and enhances the activity of HUVECs. The study also shows that STAMBPL1 interacts with FOXO1 to promote GRHL3 transcription, which in turn activates HIF1A.</p>
<p>Impact on the Field and Utility:</p>
<p>
This research is poised to exert a substantial impact on the oncological research community by uncovering the role of STAMBPL1 in TNBC angiogenesis and by identifying the STAMBPL1/FOXO1/GRHL3/HIF1α/VEGFA axis as a potential therapeutic target. The findings could pave the way for the development of novel therapeutic strategies for TNBC, a subtype characterized by a paucity of effective treatment options. The methodologies utilized in this study are likely to be valuable to the research community, offering a paradigm for investigating the role of deubiquitinating enzymes in oncogenic processes.</p>
<p>Additional Context:</p>
<p>
It would be beneficial for readers to understand the broader context of TNBC research and the current challenges in treating this aggressive cancer subtype. The significance of this work is heightened by the lack of effective treatments for TNBC, making the identification of new therapeutic targets particularly important. Furthermore, understanding the specific mechanisms by which STAMBPL1 regulates HIF1α expression could provide insights into hypoxia signaling in other cancer types as well.</p>

<p>In this manuscript, Fang et al. describe a new oncogenic function of the STAMBPL1 protein in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). STAMBPL1 is a deubiquitinase that has been poorly studied in cancer. Previous reports identify it as a promoter of epithelial to mesenchymal transition or an inhibitor of cisplatin-induced cell death, but its participation to other cancer phenotypes has not been investigated. Fang et al. find that in cell line models of TNBC, STAMBPL1 promotes expression of the transcription factor HIF-1a and its downstream target VEGF, with the consequence of stimulating neo-angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, the authors find that this occurs via a non-enzymatic and indirect mechanism, that is by promoting the expression of GRHL3, a transcription factor that in turn binds to the HIF-1a promoter to stimulate its transcription. Interestingly, the way by which STAMPB1 promotes GRHL3 expression is by facilitating the transcriptional activity of FOXO1, a known regulator of GRHL3. Because the authors find that STAMBPL1 and FOXO1 interact, they suggest that STAMBPL1 may promote the formation of an active transcriptional complex containing FOXO1, perhaps by facilitating the recruitment of transcriptional coactivators.</p>
<p>
In conclusion, these data position for the first time the STAMBPL1 deubiquitinase in a FOXO-GRHL3 regulatory axis for the control of VEGF expression and tumor angiogenesis.</p>
<p>
The main weaknesses of this work are that the relevance of this molecular axis to the pathogenesis of TNBC is not clear, and it is not clearly established whether this is a regulatory pathway that occurs in hypoxic conditions or independently of oxygen levels.</p>
<p>
With respect to the first point, both FOXO1 and GRHL3 have been previously described as tumor suppressors, with reports of FOXO1 inhibiting tumor angiogenesis. Therefore, this works describes an apparently contradictory function of these proteins in TNBC. While it is not surprising that the same genes perform divergent functions in different tumor contexts, a stronger evidence in support of the oncogenic function of these two genes should be provided to make the data more convincing. As an example, the data in support of high STAMBPL1, FOXO and GRHL3 gene expression in TNBC TCGA specimens provided in Figure 8 is not very strong and it is not clear what the non-TNBC specimens are (whether other breast cancers or other tumors, perhaps those tumors whether these genes perform tumor suppressive functions). To strengthen the notion that STAMBPL1, FOXO and GRHL3 are overexpressed in TNCB, the authors could provide a comparison with normal tissue, as well as the analysis of other publicly available datasets (like the NCI Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium as an example). Finally, is it not clear what are the basal protein expression levels of STAMBPL1 in the cell lines used in this study, as based on the data presented in Figures 2D and F it appears that the protein is not expressed if not exogenously overexpressed. It would be helpful if the authors addressed this issue and provided further evidence of STAMBPL1 expression in TNBC cell lines.</p>
<p>
Linked to these considerations is the second major criticism, namely that it is not made clear if this new regulatory axis is proposed to act in normoxic or hypoxic conditions. The experiments presented in this paper are performed in both conditions but a clear explanation as to why cells are exposed to hypoxia is not given and would be necessary being that HIF-1a transcription and not protein stability is being analyzed. Also, different hypoxic conditions are sometimes used, resulting in different mRNA levels of HIF-1a and its downstream targets and quite significant fluctuations within the same cell line from one experimental setting to the next. The authors should provide an explanation as to why experimental conditions are changed and, more importantly, the experiments presented in Figure 2 should be performed also in normoxia.</p>
<p>
Another critical point is that necessary experimental controls are sometimes missing, and this is reducing the strength of some of the conclusions enunciated by the authors. As examples, experiments where overexpression of STAMBPL1 is coupled to silencing of FOXO1 to demonstrate dependency lack FOXO1silencing the absence of STAMBPL1 overexpression. Because diminishing FOXO1 expression affects HIF-1a/VEGF transcription even in the absence of STAMBPL1 (shown in Figure 7C, D), it is not clear if the data presented in Figure 7G are significant. The difference between HIF-1a expression upon FOXO1 silencing should be compared in the presence or absence of STAMBPL1 overexpression to understand if FOXO1 impacts HIF-1a transcription dependently or independently of STAMBPL1.</p>
<p>In addition, some minor comments to improve the quality of this manuscript are provided.</p>
<p>
(1) As a general statement, the manuscript is extremely synthetic. While this is not necessarily a negative feature, sometimes results are discussed in the figure legends and not in the main text (as an example, western blots showing HIF-1a expression) and this makes it hard to read thought the data in an easy and enjoyable manner.</p>
<p>
(2) The effect of STAMBPL1 overexpression on HIF-1a transcription is minor (Figure 2) The authors should explain why they think this is the case and whether hypoxia may provide a molecular environment that is more permissive to this type of regulation.</p>
<p>
(3) HIF-1a does not appear upregulated at the protein level protein by STAMBPL1 or GRLH3 overexpression, even though this is stated in the legends of Figures 2 and 6. The authors should show unsaturated western blots images and provide quantitative data of independent experiments to make this point.</p>
<p>
In summary, adding necessary controls and performing additional experiments to substantiate the oncogenic function of these genes in TNCB would strengthen the authors' conclusions.</p>
