<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Cation-coupled transporters play critical roles in many aspects of cell physiology and pharmacokinetics and are involved in many serious diseases including cancers, metabolic diseases, neurodegenerative diseases, etc. Their specific locations and functions make them viable drug targets<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. Following decades of effort, the structures of many transporters have been determined by x-ray crystallography and, more recently, by cryoEM<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>. However, we still do not have a deep understanding of the structural basis for substrate accumulation to high concentrations, the mechanisms for the obligatorily coupled transport, as well as the cellular regulation of transporters’ activities to meet metabolic needs.</p>
<p><italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> serovar Typhimurium melibiose permease (MelB<sub>St</sub>) is the prototype Na<sup>+</sup>/solute transporter of the major facilitator superfamilies (MFS)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>. It catalyzes the stoichiometric symport of galactopyranoside with Na<sup>+</sup>, H<sup>+</sup>, or Li<sup>+</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>. Crystal structures of sugar-bound states have been determined, which reveals the sugar recognition mechanism<sup>19</sup>. In all solved x-ray crystal structures, MelB<sub>St</sub> is in an outward-facing conformation; the observed physical barrier of the sugar translocation, named the inner barrier, prevents the substrate from moving into the cytoplasm directly. It is well-known that transporters change their conformation to allow the substrate translocation from one side of the membrane to the other and conformational dynamics is the intrinsic feature necessary for their functions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>To understand how the sugar substrate and the coupling cations dictate transporter function, we have established thermodynamic binding cycles in MelB<sub>St</sub> using isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) measurements and identified that the positive cooperativity of the binding of cation and melibiose as the core symport mechanism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>; furthermore, the binding of the second substrate changes the thermodynamic feature of heat capacity change from positive to negative, suggesting primary dehydration processes when both substrates concurrently occupy the transporter<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>. While the structural origins have not yet been completely determined yet, they may be related to forming an occluded intermediate conformation, a necessary state for a global conformational transition.</p>
<p>To determine structurally unresolved states of MelB<sub>St</sub>, nanobodies (Nbs) were raised against the wild-type MelB<sub>St</sub>. One group of Nbs (Nb714, Nb725, and Nb733) has been identified to interact with the cytoplasmic side of MelB<sub>St</sub> and their binding completely inhibits MelB<sub>St</sub> transport activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>. MelB<sub>St</sub> bound with Nb725 or Nb733 retained its binding to Na<sup>+</sup>, but its affinity for melibiose is inhibited. The MelB<sub>St</sub>/Nb733 complex also retained the affinity to its physiological regulator dephosphorylated EIIA<sup>Glc</sup> of the glucose-specific phosphoenolpyruvate:phosphotransferase system (PTS). EIIA<sup>Glc</sup>, the central metabolite regulator in bacterial catabolic repression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>, greatly inhibited the galactoside binding to non-PTS permeases MelB <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup> and the H<sup>+</sup>-coupled lactose permease (LacY)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>, but still retained the binding of Na<sup>+</sup> to MelB <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>. Thus, the functional modulation of the two Nbs on MelB mimics the binding of EIIA<sup>Glc</sup>. The crystal structure of dephosphorylated EIIA<sup>Glc</sup> binding to the maltose permease MalFGK<sub>2</sub>, an ATP-binding cassette transporter, has been determined<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>, but there is no structural information on EIIA<sup>Glc</sup> binding to the MFS transporters. Determination of the structures of MelB<sub>St</sub> in complex with this group of Nbs is important and will reveal critical information to understand the manner by which EIIA<sup>Glc</sup> regulates the large group of MFS sugar transporters.</p>
<p>In the current study, we applied cryoEM single-particle analysis (cryoEM-SPA) and determined the near-atomic resolution structure of MelB<sub>St</sub> complexed with a Nb725_4, a modified Nb725 with a designed scaffold which enables NabFab binding<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>. The use of the Nb provided a Na<sup>+</sup>-bound lower sugar-affinity inward-facing conformation of MelB<sub>St</sub>. Furthermore, our studies using this conformation-selective Nb in combination with hydrogen/deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) demonstrate a powerful approach for characterizing protein conformational flexibility<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>, and also provides critical dynamic information to understand how the substrate binding drives the conformational transition necessary for the substrate translocation in MelB<sub>St</sub>.</p>

<title>CDR grafting to generate a hybrid Nb and its functional characterization</title>
<p>To facilitate structure determination of MelB<sub>St</sub> complexed with the conformation selective Nb by cryoEM-SPA, a novel universal tool based on a NabFab was applied to increase the effective mass of small particles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>, since MelB<sub>St</sub> (mass, 53.5 kDa) has limited extramembrane mass. A hybrid Nb725_4 was created by complementarity-determining region (CDR) grafting or antibody reshaping<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup> to transfer the binding specificity of MelB<sub>St</sub> Nb725 to the TC-Nb4 recognized by the NabFab<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup> (<bold>sFig. 1a</bold>). Extensive <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> functional characterization revealed that the hybrid Nb725_4 possesses the binding properties of its parents Nbs (Nb725 and TC-Nb41) with slightly compromised affinities to MelB<sub>St</sub>. Nb725_4 binds to MelB<sub>St</sub> intracellularly and inhibits MelB-mediated melibiose fermentation and active transport, with an equilibrium dissociation constant (<italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub>) of 3.64 ± 0.62 µM, compared to 1.58 ± 0.42 µM for Nb725 (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a-d</xref></bold>; <bold><xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref></bold>).</p>

<p>The parent Nb725 had a poor binding to the NabFab (<bold>sFig. 1b</bold>)<bold><sub>,</sub></bold> but Nb725_4 exhibited greatly increased affinity to NabFab at a <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> value of 52.53 ± 13.03 nM (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref></bold>; <bold><xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref></bold>).

<p>Nb725_4 binding properties were further analyzed in the presence of the MelB ligands. As expected, the presence of melibiose yielded 6-and 3-fold inhibition, and α-NPG afforded 8-and 4-fold inhibition, on the binding of Nb725 and Nb725_4, respectively (<bold><xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref></bold>; <bold>sFig. 2</bold>). The physiological regulatory protein EIIA<sup>Glc</sup> (<bold><xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref></bold>; <bold>sFig. 2</bold>) showed no inhibition on the binding affinity of both Nbs.</p>

<p>Various ligands binding to the Nb/MelB<sub>St</sub> complex in the presence of Na<sup>+</sup> were also examined with ITC. As published<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>, the melibiose binding was undetectable in the presence of Nb725 (<bold>sFig. 3a</bold>). To characterize the sugar effect quantitatively, the α-NPG binding was carried out. Interestingly, the exothermic binding observed in the absence of the Nb changed to endothermic binding reactions in the Nb-bound states; and also, the α-NPG affinity decreased by 21-or 32-fold for Nb725 or Nb725-4, respectively (<bold><xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref></bold>; <bold>sFig. 3b</bold>).

Collectively, galactosides binding to MelB<sub>St</sub> were mutually exclusive with Nbs (Nb725, Nb725_4, or Nb733) or EIIA<sup>Glc</sup>, and the negative cooperativity implied that MelB<sub>St</sub> conformations favored by galactosides and those binders differ. This conclusion was further supported by the Na<sup>+</sup> or EIIA<sup>Glc</sup> binding to the MelB<sub>St</sub>/Nb complexes (<bold><xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref></bold>; <bold>sFig. 3c-d)</bold>, which showed no inhibition for Na<sup>+</sup> affinity and even slightly better binding for EIIA<sup>Glc</sup>. Therefore, MelB<sub>St</sub> complexed with Nb725_4 retains its physiological functions, and its conformation is expected to be similar when trapped by either of those Nbs and EIIA<sup>Glc</sup> but is different from the sugar-bound outward-facing structure [PDB ID 7L17]<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>.</p>

<title>Inward-facing MelB<sub>St</sub> trapped by Nb725_4</title>
<p>CryoEM-SPA was used to image the complex consisting of MelB<sub>St</sub> in nanodiscs, Nb725_4, NabFab, and anti-Fab Nb. The data collection, processing, and evaluation followed the standard protocols <bold>(sFigs. 4-5)</bold>. From a total number of 296,925 selected particles, structures of MelB<sub>St</sub>, Nb725_4, and NabFab were determined to a golden standard Fourier shell correlation (GSFSC) resolution of 3.29 Å at 0.143 (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref></bold>). The map for anti-Fab Nb were relatively poor and excluded from particle reconstruction. The quality of the Coulomb potential map allowed for unambiguous docking of available coordinates of NabFab [PDB ID 7PHP], a predicted model for Nb725_4 by Alpha-Fold 2<sup>40,41</sup>, and the N-terminal helix bundle from the outward-facing crystal structure of D59C MelB<sub>St</sub> [PDB ID 7L17]. The C-terminal helix bundle of MelB<sub>St</sub> and the ion Na<sup>+</sup> were manually built. The final model contains 417 MelB<sub>St</sub> residues (positions 2-210, 219-355, and 362-432), with 6 unassigned side-chains at the C-terminal domain (Leu293, Tyr355, Arg363, Tyr369, Tyr396, and Met410) due to the map disorder, 122 of Nb725_4 residues 2-123, and 229 of NabFab H-chain residues 1-214, and 210 of NabFab L-chain residues 4-213, respectively. The local resolution estimate showed that the cores of NabFab, Nb725_4, and the N-terminal helix bundle of MelB<sub>St</sub> exhibit better resolutions up to 2.84 Å and most regions in the C-terminal helix bundle of MelB<sub>St</sub> have resolutions between 3.2 to 3.6 Å (<bold>sFig. 6a</bold>). The N-terminal helix bundle has a completely connected density; however, the map corresponding to three cytoplasmic loops at positions 211-218 in the middle loop<sub>6-7</sub>, positions 356-361 in loop<sub>10-11</sub>, or the entire C-terminal tail after Tyr432, is missing. The map quality, model statistics, and the model-map matching <italic>Q</italic> scores, generally matched to this reporting resolution (<bold>Supplementary sTable 1; sFig. 6a-c</bold>).</p>
<p>The NabFab structure in this complex is virtually identical to that in the NorM complex [PDB ID 7PHP]<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup> with rmsd of all atoms of 1.334 Å (<bold>sFig. 7a-c</bold>). When the alignment focused on the NabFab H-chain, the two NabFab/Nb binary complexes in both complexes were organized similarly (<bold>sFig. 7d)</bold>, and the binding of Nbs with their corresponding transporters varied.</p>
<p>The structure shows that the Nb725_4 is bound to the cytoplasmic side of MelB<sub>St</sub> at an inward-open conformation (<bold>sFig. 8a&amp;b)</bold>, which supports the functional analyses and reveals the MelB<sub>St</sub> conformation for the Nb binding. The contact surfaces match in shape and surface potential with a contact area of 435 A<sup>2</sup>. CDR-1 (Arg30, Asp31, Asn32, and Ala33) and CDR-2 (Tyr52, Asp53, Leu54, Tyr56, Thr57, and Ala58) form interactions with two cytoplasmic regions of MelB<sub>St</sub>, the tip between helices IV and V, i.e., loop<sub>4-5</sub>, (Pro132, Thr133, Asp137, Lys138, and Arg141) and the beginning region of the middle loop<sub>6-7</sub> (Tyr205, Ser206, and Ser207) (<bold>sFig. 8c</bold>). The Nb binding was stabilized by salt-bridge and hydrogen-bonding interactions at both corners of this stretch of inter-protein contacts. In the published outward-open conformation of MelB<sub>St</sub>, such a binding surface for recognizing Nb725_4 does not exist. Most regions of the middle loop, the C-terminal helix bundle, and the C-terminal tail helix must be displaced to permit the binding, and some of those regions are completely disordered in this inward-facing structure. All data supported that Nb725_4 only binds to MelB<sub>St</sub> in an inward-open state. Thus, it is a conformation-selective Nb.</p>
<p>Nb725_4, Nb725, and another Nb733<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup> behave similarly; all inhibit the sugar binding and transport. We conclude that all three binders are the inward-facing conformation-specific negative modulators of MelB<sub>St</sub>. Further, ITC measurements (<bold>sFig. 2</bold>) showed that MelB<sub>St</sub> binds to either of three Nbs in the absence or presence of EIIA<sup>Glc</sup> or binds to EIIA<sup>Glc</sup> in the absence or presence of either Nbs. The complex composed of MelB<sub>St</sub>, EIIA<sup>Glc</sup>, and Nb725 (or Nb733<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>) can be isolated (<bold>sFig. 9</bold>).</p>

<p>The crystal structure of sugar-bound D59C MelB<sub>St</sub> (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3c&amp;d</xref></bold>; <bold>sFig. 11)</bold>, which retains an intact sugar-binding and translocation pathway, shows that the sugar-binding pocket is formed by both N-and C-terminal bundles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. Due to the Cys mutation, the cation-binding pocket is loosely packed and this mutant does not bind Na<sup>+</sup> or Li<sup>+</sup>. When overlaying the outward-facing crystal structure upon the inward-facing cryoEM structures (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3d</xref></bold>, <bold>sticks in black</bold>), little variation of the positioning of the sugar-binding residues on the N-terminal bundle is observed except for Arg149, but all C-terminal residues involved in the sugar-binding pocket show greater displacements. In the cation-site mutant, Lys377 forms a salt-bridge interaction with Asp55; in the Na<sup>+</sup>-bound structure, Lys377 is closer to Asp124, and Asp55 is liganded with Na<sup>+</sup>.</p>
<p>The loosely arranged sugar-binding residues observed in the Nb725_4-bound conformation provide the structural foundation for measured lower sugar affinities (<bold><xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref></bold>), so this structure represents an intracellular Na<sup>+</sup>-bound sugar-releasing conformation. Since the positioning of the key residues for galactoside specificity (Lys18, Asp19, and Asp124) exhibits virtually no change, it is conceivable that this conformation retains the initial recognition of sugar for reversal reactions, a common feature for carrier transporters<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup>.</p>

<title>Conformational changes between inward-and outward-facing states</title>
<p>The outward-facing structure was trimmed to match the residues resolved in the inward structure. The superposition of the outward-and inward-facing MelB<sub>St</sub> exhibited rmsd of all atoms of 5.035 Å (<bold>sFig. 12a)</bold>, and the major displacement exists at both ends of transmembrane helices. The alignment based on the N-terminal positions 2-200 or the C-terminal positions 231-432 exhibits a clear difference in the angle of the domain packing (<bold>sFig. 12b&amp;c)</bold>. The focused alignment of positions 2-200 or 231-432 exhibits greatly reduced rmsd values (<bold>sFig. 12d&amp;e</bold>). The N-terminal domains at both conformations are virtually the same, especially for the helices-I, -II, and -IV that host the sugar-and cation-specificity determinant pockets (<bold>sFig. 12f</bold>). Some structural rearrangements within 3-5 Å exist in the C-terminal bundle, especially on both ends of cavity-lining helices (VII, VIII, X, and XI) and their link or extended loop (<bold>sFig. 12g&amp;h</bold>). Thus, the conformational changes between the outward-and inward-facing states can be adequately described by a rocker-switch-like movement with some structural rearrangements in the C-terminal bundle as also indicated in <bold>sFig. 13</bold>.</p>

<title>Substrate translocation barriers</title>
<p>The two structures clearly reveal the two essential barriers critical for substrate translocation, the thicker inner barrier in the outward structure and the thinner outer barrier in the inward structure (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a&amp;d</xref></bold>). The core of the inner barrier is formed by three-helix pairs from both domains (V/VIII, IV/X, and back II/XI), and stabilized by an extensive charged network (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b</xref></bold>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup>. The N-terminal Arg141 (helix-V) forms salt-bridge interactions with the C-terminal Asp351 and Asp354 (helix-X), and this core interaction links with four other charged residues to stabilize the cytoplasmic closure by forming an inner barrier. In addition, the inner barrier is also stabilized by two peripheral amphiphilic helices at the cytoplasmic side (in the middle loop and the C-terminal tail) (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b</xref></bold>). The entire middle loop<sub>6-7</sub> across the two domains interact with broader areas (the N-terminal loop<sub>2-3</sub>, loop<sub>4-5</sub>, and helices-II &amp; -IV, as well as the C-terminal loop<sub>10-11</sub>, helices-X &amp; - XI, and the C-terminal tail). The C-terminal tail helix interacts with both N-and C-terminal domains (helices-V &amp;-X). The contacting area between the two bundles (based on positions 2-212 and 213-450) is 2218 Å<sup>2</sup> with nine salt-bridge and five hydrogen-bounding interactions.</p>

<p>The core of the outer barrier in the inward-facing structure is also formed by three pairs of helices from both domains (V/VIII, I/VII, and II/XI) (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4f</xref></bold>). The longest loop<sub>11-12</sub> at the periplasmic side moves into the middle area and forms contacts with helices-I and -VII, sealing the periplasmic opening. Notably, helical pair I/VII or IV/X is only involved in the outer or inner barrier, respectively, and the other two cavity-lining helical pairs (V/VIII and II/XI) are engaged in both barriers (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b, c, &amp; e, f</xref></bold>). The contact area between the two bundles at the periplasmic side of 1435 Å<sup>2</sup> is much smaller. These structural features further supported that the outward-facing state is more stable than the inward-facing MelB<sub>St</sub>. In the inward-facing conformation, all of the salt-bridge interactions are broken (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b&amp;e</xref></bold>), and the Arg141 and Lys138 engage in the binding of Nb725_4 (<bold>sFig. 8c</bold>). Therefore, this cytoplasmic-side salt-bridge network is the inner barrier-specific.</p>
<p>Assessed by the sugar-bound structure (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref></bold>), the substrate-binding pocket is outlined by Trp128 and Trp 342 on the inner barrier and Tyr26 on the outer barrier (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3d</xref></bold>; <bold>sFigs. 11, 12f</bold>), part of both barriers. Notably, the major binding residues that involve the multiple hydrogen-bonding interactions with the galactosyl moiety are only part of the inner barrier. In the inward-facing state, the inner barrier is broken, which exposes the binding site to the cytoplasm and also results in the interruption of the sugar-binding pocket (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4d</xref></bold>). The C-terminal binding residues moved away due to the displacement of the backbone of helices-X/XI, and the sugar-binding residues become loosely organized with a low sugar-binding affinity. The structural features indicated that the molecular mechanisms for the sugar translocation simply result from the barrier switch generating a low sugar-affinity inward state of MelB. The outer barrier does not contain residues essential for galactoside binding, so the break of the outer barrier has a much less profound effect on the sugar-binding affinity.</p>

<p>The effect of MelB<sub>St</sub> structural dynamics imposed by Nb725_4 is presented as the differential deuterium labeling (ΔD). As shown in the residual plot of each peptide between the two states (D<sub>Nb725_4-bound – Nb-free</sub>) (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5b</xref></bold>) at three labeling time points, variable levels of protections (less deuterium exchange in the complex state) are observed in MelB<sub>St</sub>. A slight deprotection is only observed at the N-terminus. After proper statistical analysis, there are 232 positions (&gt;50% labeled positions) exhibiting insignificant HDX changes (D<sub>Nb725_4-bound – Nb-free</sub> value &lt; |0.3184| or P &gt; 0.05) as indicated by ribbon representation (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5b</xref></bold>). The remaining 177 positions, not counting the His tag, covered by 71 overlapping peptides show statistically significant changes (D<sub>Nb725_4-bound – Nb-free</sub> value ≥ |0.3184| and P ≤ 0.05) and are highlighted by the cartoon representation (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref></bold>). Overall, those regions are mainly distributed on the cavity-lining helices and cytoplasmic peripheral regions including the middle loop and C-terminal tails, as well as the C-terminal periplasmic loops. The corresponding deuterium uptake curves covering 3-magnitude time points were plotted <bold>(Extended Fig. 1)</bold> and the representative peptides were displayed as insets around the structure (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref></bold>, <bold>insets)</bold>. Most Nb725_4 binding residues are not covered, either not covered by the labeled peptides (Tyr205, Ser206, and Ser207) or by insignificant change (Pro132 and Thr133), except for Asp137, Lys138, and Arg141 that were presented in 8 peptides. Depending upon the exchange rate and response to the binding of Nb725_4, the MelB<sub>St</sub> HDX can be categorized into four groups.</p>
<p><underline>Group-I</underline> peptides show low-level HDX exchange rates and Nb725_4 afforded complete inhibition for up to at least 50 min (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref></bold>, <bold>cartoon and curve in blue</bold>). These peptides are located in transmembrane helices, middle-loop helix, and C-terminal periplasmic loops across both domains and most are clustered at the cavity-lining helices. Peptides carrying the Nb-binding residues Asp137, Lys138, and Arg141 are marked in the plots (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref></bold>, <bold>inset; Extended Fig. 1</bold>). <underline>Group II</underline> peptides show faster deuterium uptake over time (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref></bold>, <bold>cartoon and curve in deep olive</bold>). The Nb725_4 binding affords small to moderate protections. The group-II peptides are spotted at three cytoplasmic regions; interestingly, all surround the helix-X, which plays a critical role in the stability of the inner barrier. At the inward-facing structure, most of those residues are either missing or poorly resolved. The deuterium uptakes in the Nb725_4-bound MelB<sub>St</sub> complex likely result from structural flexibility.</p>
<p><underline>Group-III</underline> peptides show higher-level HDX exchange rates of greater than 60% for both bound and free states even at 30 sec (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref></bold>, <bold>drawing in yellow</bold>). Nb725_4 only affords short-time, weak protections. They are located in the C-terminal tail unstructured region, and most of them are structurally unresolved due to severe disorders. <underline>Group-VI</underline> peptide only contains the short N-terminal tail showing a medium-level uptake (40-50%) across all labeling times, and Nb725_4 affords a slight deprotection due to allosteric changes upon the Nb725_4 binding (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref></bold>, <bold>cartoon and curve in red</bold>). The results show that Group III and IV peptides covering both tails are solvent-accessible dynamic regions, which is consistent with the notion that they play little role in transport-critical conformational transitions.</p>
<p>The 30-sec deuterium uptake in the absence of Nb725_4 for the first two groups was further analyzed. Among the five group-I and four group-II members with faster exchanges as judged by the shortest reaction time of 30 sec (<bold>sFig. 14)</bold>, except for the two periplasmic loop<sub>7-8</sub> (peptide 261-271) and loop<sub>9-10</sub> (peptide 317-326), others are clustered on the cytoplasmic side. In the outward-facing structure (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7a</xref></bold>), the spotted peptides pack against one another: helix-V (peptide 137-150) with helix-VIII (peptide 284-289), and the middle-loop helix (peptide 220-233) with helix-X (peptide 364-368). All surround the conformation-dependent charged network. Notably, this short peptide 137-150 links the sugar-binding residue Arg149 to the charged network by residues Lys138, Arg141, and Glu142 (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b</xref></bold>). In the inward-facing structure (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7b</xref></bold>), these packed helices were moved against one another. Therefore, these higher dynamic regions may play important roles in responding to the ligand binding and initiating the global conformational transition.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Formation and stabilization of a high-energy inward-facing conformation of MelB<sub>St</sub> in a form suitable for structure determination by cryoEM-SPA was a technically challenging sample preparation problem, which we solved by the formation of a complex of MelB<sub>St</sub> with a conformation-selective binder and fiducial NabFab. The resulting structure, a high-energy inward-facing, low sugar-affinity state of MelB<sub>St</sub> with a bound Na<sup>+</sup>, represents the intracellular sugar-releasing/rebinding state in the stepped-binding model for the mechanism of coupled transport (<bold><xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref></bold>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. Our previous results on the cooperativity of binding<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup> supported the contention that Na<sup>+</sup> binding increases the melibiose affinity to allow melibiose uptake at lower available concentrations, a critical evolved mechanism for cation-coupled transporters. The new Na<sup>+</sup>-bound sugar-releasing inward-facing cryoEM structure provides a structural basis to support the transport model based on a sequential process of the sugar-binding after Na<sup>+</sup> binding first and sugar release prior to Na<sup>+</sup> release (<bold><xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref></bold>).</p>

<p>Eight states are postulated including transient intermediates. In this reversal reaction, the cation binds prior to the sugar and releases after sugar release. Melibiose active transport or inflex begins at step [1] and proceeds via the red arrows clockwise around the circle, with one melibiose and one cation inwardly across the membrane per cycle. Melibiose efflux begins at step [6] and proceeds via the black arrows anti-clockwise around the circle, with one melibiose and one cation outwardly across the membrane per circle. Melibiose exchange begins at step 6, and only takes 4 steps involving steps [2 – 5] as highlighted in gray color. The low-sugar affinity inward-facing Na<sup>+</sup>-bound cryoEM structure represents the state after the release of sugar, as indicated by a dashed box.</p></caption>

<p>The alternating-access movement has been widely used to describe the conformational change of transporters<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>. This description focuses on how the substrates access their binding site or leave the protein. The core symport mechanism for coupled substrate translocations is the mobile barriers involving the inner and outer barriers as proposed originally by Peter Mitchell<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup> (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a&amp;d</xref></bold>). Our binding thermodynamic cycle study on the determination of heat capacity change (∆<italic>C</italic><sub>p</sub>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup> showed positive values with the binding of one substrate, suggesting the dominance of hydrations and opening of the transporter, and negative values with the second substrate binding, suggesting dehydration and transition to the occluded intermediate state as indicated at step [3] in <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref>. The data fit well with a barrier mechanism that prevents a single substrate molecule from crossing the protein to favor obligatory co-translocation. When this inner barrier breaks as a result of the conformational switch induced by the binding of two substrates, the sugar-binding specific pocket which is part of this inner barrier also breaks (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4e</xref></bold>), creating the intracellular sugar low-affinity state and the sugar-releasing path. Collectively, based on structural and thermodynamical analyses, all show that cooperative binding is integral to barrier switching in the core symport mechanism.</p>
<p>For substrate translocation, historically, a two-binding-site walking model was proposed: a high-affinity site at the outer surface and a low-affinity site at the inner surface. In this functional and structural paradigm, a substrate molecule moves across the protein from its high-affinity binding site to a low-affinity site for subsequent release. This canonical model has been challenged in LacY as the same binding affinity was measured at both the inner and outer surfaces<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup>, and a single substrate-binding site was also observed in its 3D structures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>. Therefore, a single-binding site in the middle of the protein has been the current canonical model. Actually, one of the major challenges in measuring the substrate binding in membrane transporters is the intrinsic dynamic feature of the transport proteins, which makes it difficult to attribute the outcome to a specific state. Therefore, the substrate binding affinity measured in a bulk sample is an average of binding affinities from all of the individual molecules in a distribution. It is also challenging to establish a correlation between measured binding affinities and experimentally determined structures. We approached this problem by using the conformation-specific binding protein Nb725_4 to decouple the binding and conformational dynamics shifting conformers to a single state or a narrowed cluster, i.e., through experimental modulation of the distribution. The results of the structural determination and binding analysis in the combination of the conformation-selective Nb permitted the extension of the current single substrate-binding site (and single affinity) model to a more refined model of one site possessing conformation-dependent higher-affinity and lower-affinity states. Identification of this critical lower-affinity inward-open state of the sugar-binding site is significant for understanding the molecular basis of higher intracellular substrate accumulation.</p>
<p>The shared cation site for Na<sup>+</sup>, Li<sup>+</sup>, or H<sup>+</sup>, which is hosted only by the N-terminal two helices (II and IV), is in close proximity but not part of the mobile barrier at either outward-and inward-facing state. The inward-facing state retains the Na<sup>+</sup> binding affinity (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d</xref></bold>; <bold><xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref></bold>) and the bound Na<sup>+</sup> ion was observed (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3ab</xref></bold>). Consistently, the simulated Na<sup>+</sup>-binding site at both outward-and inward-facing conformations is virtually identical (<bold>sFig. 10</bold>), which is in stark contrast to the conformation-dependent sugar binding in MelB<sub>St</sub>. No conformational dependency of Na<sup>+</sup> binding might suggest the mechanism for the reversible reaction. It is likely that this Na<sup>+</sup>-binding site co-evolved with the <italic>E. coli</italic> intracellular Na<sup>+</sup> homeostasis maintained to 3-5 mM<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></sup> to achieve optimal activity.</p>
<p>To interrogate the structural dynamics of MelB<sub>St</sub> and conformational switch mechanisms, an HDX-MS comparability study in the absence or presence of the conformational Nb725_4 was performed. HDX-MS is a powerful approach for characterizing protein conformational flexibility and dynamics<sup>37,38</sup> and has recently been applied to membrane transport proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref></sup>. Under experimental conditions, two major parameters (solvent accessibility and hydrogen protonation) contribute to the H/D exchange rate. The residual plot clearly indicates that the major effects of Nb725_4 binding are the reduction of the conformational dynamics of MelB<sub>St</sub> (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5b</xref></bold>). Stronger protections are observed at both transmembrane helix bundles, especially both ends of the cavity-lining helices (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref></bold>, <bold>cartoon in blue</bold>), which marks the most conformationally dynamic regions that correlate to the conformational transition in MelB<sub>St</sub>. Notably, the Nb-free Na<sup>+</sup>-bound WT MelB<sub>St</sub> exists in both outward-and inward-facing conformations with a bias towards the outward-facing state<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>, and the MelB<sub>St</sub> in the Nb725_4 complex exists only as an inward-facing conformational ensemble. Therefore, the differences observed by HDX-MS between the two samples in the absence and presence of Nb725_4 likely disclosed, to some extent, the MelB<sub>St</sub> global conformational transitions, in addition to the atomic motions.</p>
<p>While the resolution of HDX is at a peptide level, the data showed marked effects on two well-conserved cytoplasmic helices of MFS transporters (on the middle loop and the C-terminal tail). Those peripheral amphiphilic helices are likely to play important roles in the stability of the inner barrier. Consistently, a recent atomic force microscopy study has shown that the middle loop becomes loosely packed in the presence of both sugar and cation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>As described, the peptide 137-150 of helix-V contains a sugar-binding residue Arg149 and three conformation-critical residues Lys138, Arg141, and Glu142 in the inner barrier-specific charged network (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref></bold>). Extensive site-directed mutagenesis and second-site suppression showed that this charged network play important role in the conformational changes and the mutations at all three Arg at positions 141, 295 and 363 (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b</xref></bold>) can be substantially rescued by a single mutation D35E (helix-I) located at the other side of the membrane<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup>. Arg141 and Glu142 of <italic>E. coli</italic> MelB have been shown to participate in the conformational transition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref></sup>. Pro148 has been identified by second-site mutation to reduce the transport <italic>V</italic><sub>max</sub> of a <italic>V</italic><sub>max</sub> elevated mutant by modulating the rate of conformational change<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref></sup>. Thus, the helix-V dynamic region (peptide 137-150) could link the sugar-binding pocket with the inner barrier-specific salt-bridge network. Together with the interactions with the dynamic regions (residues 284-289) of helix-VIII, the substrate binding occupancy could be propagated, via an allosteric mechanism, from the sugar-binding pocket to the cytoplasmic peripheral helices as a pre-transition for the opening of the transporter to the cytoplasm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>All of the conformation-selective nanobodies (Nb725, Nb733, and the hybrid Nb725_4) are expected to bind MelB<sub>St</sub> similarly and trap it at the high-energy state, which is consistent with the observation of very low-frequency occurrence during Nbs selection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>. The effects of the Nbs binding mimic the regulatory effect imposed by EIIA<sup>Glc</sup> binding<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>, i.e., reduction of sugar-binding affinity with no change in the Na<sup>+</sup> binding. Interestingly, either Nbs or EIIA<sup>Glc</sup> can bind to MelB<sub>St</sub> in the absence or presence of the other (<bold><xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref></bold>; <bold>sFigs. 2&amp;3</bold>); the complex composed of all three proteins can be isolated (<bold>sFig. 9</bold>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>. The extensive comparisons strongly support the notion that the Nbs and EIIA<sup>Glc</sup> can concurrently recognize two spatially distinct epitopes of MelB<sub>St</sub>, and the inward-facing conformation trapped by the Nb mimics the conformation of MelB<sub>St</sub> under the EIIA<sup>Glc</sup> regulation. Available data showed that three positions (Asp438, Arg441, and Ile445) on one face of the C-terminal tail helix of MelB<sub>St</sub> might be involved in EIIA<sup>Glc</sup> binding<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref></sup>, and this region is conserved with the later known EIIA<sup>Glc</sup> binding site in MalK<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>. Thus, the cytoplasmic surface of the C-terminal domain could potentially support the EIIA<sup>Glc</sup> binding at the inward-facing state; unfortunately, the C-terminal tail helix is disordered in this Nb-bound inward-facing structure,</p>
<p>In this study, we demonstrated that the mobile barrier mechanism plays a central role in substate translocation, the barrier dynamics are modulated by the cooperative binding of substrates, and the inner/outer barrier shifting directly regulates the sugar-binding affinity, with no effect on the Na<sup>+</sup> binding. Furthermore, we proposed that the functional inhibition of this MFS transporter by the central regulatory protein EIIA<sup>Glc</sup> is achieved by trapping MelB<sub>St</sub> in a low-sugar affinity inward-facing state. Overall, our studies provide substantial information to explain the obligatorily coupled transport of Na<sup>+</sup> and sugar substrate in structural and dynamic terms collectively.</p>

All samples were degassed by a TA Instruments Degassing Station (model 6326) for 15 min prior to the titration. Heat changes were collected at 25 °C, and data processing was performed with the NanoAnalyze (v. 3.7.5 software) provided with the instrument. The normalized heat changes were subtracted from the heat of dilution elicited by the last few injections, where no further binding occurred, and the corrected heat changes were plotted against the mole ratio of titrant versus titrand. The values for the binding association constant (<italic>K</italic><sub>a</sub>) were obtained by fitting the data using the one-site independent-binding model included in the NanoAnalyze software (version 3.7.5), and the dissociation constant (<italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub>) = 1/<italic>K</italic><sub>a</sub>.

<title>Grids vitrification and single-particle cryoEM data acquisition</title>
<p>Grids preparation and data collection were carried out in S<sup>2</sup>C<sup>2</sup> (Menlo Park, CA). The WT MelB<sub>St</sub>/Nb725_4/NabFab/anti-NabFab Nb complex was thawed out from -80 °C storage. Aliquots of 3 μL of samples at 0.75 mg/ml or 1.5 mg/ml protein concentration were placed on 300-mesh Cu holey carbon grids (Quantifoil, R1.2/1.3) after glow-discharge (PELCO easiGlow™) at 15 mA for 30 sec, and blotted on two sides for 3 sec at 4 °C and 100% humidity before vitrified in liquid ethane using a Vitrobot Mark IV (Thermo Fisher). The grids were subsequently transferred to a Titan Krios (G3i) electron microscope (Thermo Fisher) operating at 300 kV and equipped with K3 direct electron detector (Gatan) and BioQuantum energy filter. The best grids were found from the sample at 1.5 mg/ml concentration.</p>
<p>A total of 14,094 and 8715 movies were automatically collected using the EPU Data Acquisition Software (Thermo Fisher) for non-tilted and 30-degree tilted collections, respectively. Both datasets were collected at a 0.86 Å pixel size and a dose of 50 e<sup>−</sup>/Å<sup>−2</sup> across 40 frames (0.0535 or 0.07025 sec per frame for the non-tilted and tilted data collection, respectively) at a dose rate of approximately 23.36 or 17.8 e<sup>−</sup>/Å<sup>2</sup>/s, respectively. A set of defocus values was applied ranging from -0.8, -1.0, -1.2, -1.4, or -1.8 μm with an energy filter slit width of 20 eV and a 100 μm objective aperture.</p>

<title>Single-particle data processing</title>
<p>All cryoEM single-particle data processing was performed using CryoSPARC program (v. 2 – 4.01) (<bold>sFig. 4a</bold>). All imported movies were aligned using defaulted Patch Motion Correction and followed with defaulted Patch contrast transfer function (CTF) Estimation. Micrographs were then curated based on CFT Estimation, astigmatism, and ice thickness, which resulted in 13,649 and 7,129 micrographs for the non-tilted and 30-degree tilted datasets, respectively.</p>
<p>Initially, particle picking from the 2000 micrographs was performed using Blob Picker using 120 and 160 Å for the minimal and maximal particle diameters, respectively, in the CryoSPARC program (<bold>sFig. 4b)</bold>. A total of 1,087,124 particles were selected and extracted with a box size of 256 pixels. After 2 runs of 2D Classification, five classes were selected as imputing templates in Template Picker. A total of resultant 9,103,229 particles from 13,649 micrographs were extracted with a box size of 384 pixels bin 92 pixels and subjected to iterative rounds of 2D Classification. The yielded 1,245,734 particles were re-extracted at a box size of 416 pixels. After further sorting using 2D Classification, the highly selected 338,883 particles, which clearly contained nanodisc-surrounding MelB<sub>St</sub> bound with Nb725_4/NabFab/anti-NabFab Nb, were used for Ab-Initio 3D Reconstruction. One out of 5 Ab-Initio classes contained the expected super-complex from a total of 93,693 particles, which allowed for a 3.80 Å volume to be reconstructed using Non-uniform Refinement. The 93,693 particles were then further sorted using heterogeneous refinement with input volumes created by multiclass Ab-initio to a subset of 41,264 particles, which allowed a 3.49 Å volume to be reconstructed using Non-uniform Refinement with a static mask prepared from one of the volumes. This map was successfully used to build the initial model of all four proteins; however, this map was anisotropic and lacked some orientations in angular space. To improve the map quality, two strategies were applied including reprocessing this dataset and performing tilted data collection. The hand of the 3.49 Å volume was changed and used to generate 50 templates.</p>
<p>Template Pick using the 50 templated was applied to the 13,649 micrographs, which generated 7,632,727 particles (<bold>sFig. 4c)</bold>. After extraction at a box size of 384 pixels bin 92 pixels and iterative rounds of 2D Classification and Heterogeneous Refinement, 370,941 particles were selected and re-extract at a box size of 384 pixels. This 370,941-particle set was combined with the previously identified 41,264-particle set after extraction at a box size of 384 pixels and removed duplicate, the subset of 188,566 particles exhibited slightly improved directional distribution. To further explore the first data collection, the previously rejected 2D classes were analyzed and 214,522 particles were selected based on orientation. After combined and iterative rounds of 2D Classification, Heterogeneous Refinement, and Local Refinement, a subset of the 196,254-particle set supported a 3.39 Å volume to be reconstructed using local refinement, and the directional distribution of the map is further improved.</p>
<p>A tilted data collection on the same microscopy and parameter settings was performed with a 30-degree tilt (<bold>sFig. 4c)</bold>. A total number of 7,129 micrographs were obtained. The 50-templates were used for particle pick, which yielded 2,887,147 particles after curation. The particles were extracted using a box size of 384 bin 96 pixels. After 3-run 2D Classification and followed 3-run Heterogeneous Refinement using the 3.39 Å volumes and the other two Ab-initio volumes, a subset of 544,531 particles were re-extracted using a box size of 384 pixels. After further iterative rounds of 2D Classification, Heterogeneous Refinement, and Local Refinement, 182,101 particles were obtained for the tilted collection, which could support a 4.01 Å volume using Local Refinement and directional distribution focused on the missing angles in the first dataset.</p>
<p>A total number of 378,355 polished particles from both non-tilted and 30-degree tilted data acquisition were used to reconstruct a 3.40 Å volume using Local Refinement, and the 30-degree tilted data filled the missing particle orientations but the resolution was not improved. The particles were subjected to 3D Classifications using a target resolution of 3.3 Å and 10 classes and the highest resolution classes were collected. The final collected 296,925-particle set supported a 3.37 Å volume to be reconstructed using Local Refinement and a static mask covering MelB<sub>St</sub>, Nb725_4, and NabFab. The reporting GSFSC resolution of 3.29 Å was calculated by Validation (FSC) using the two half maps, and the particle distribution was calculated by ThereDFSC (<bold>sFig. 5</bold>).</p>
<p>The initial mask for Non-uniformed Refinement was created in UCSF ChimeraX using the volume generated from Ab-Initio 3D Reconstruction which covered the full complex. The refinement masks for final-stage Local Refinement only covered MelB<sub>St</sub>, Nb725_4, and NabFab and filtered at a low pass to 10 Å and soft padding width of 10. The 3D Classification used the full-covered mask as the solvent mask and the refinement masks in the Local Refinement as the focus mask.</p>
<p>Local Refinement set the initial low pass resolution of 8 Å, use of pose/shift Gaussian prior during alignment, Rotation search extent of 9 °, and Shift search extent of 6 Å. The final 3.29 Å volume was sharpened in Phenex auto_sharpen program<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref></sup> default setting for model refinement.</p>

<title>Model building and structure refinement</title>
<p>The initial model building was carried out based on the 3.45 Å reconstruction map obtained from the first dataset. The coordinates of MelB<sub>St</sub> D59C (PDB ID 7L17), NabFab and anti-NabFab Nb (PDB ID 7PHP), and a sequence-based 3-D model generated by AlphaFold 2 were fitted into the map in UCSF ChimeraX<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">73</xref></sup>. The N-terminal helices of MelB<sub>St</sub> fit well and the C-terminal helices were manually fitted into the initial map. The sequence of MelB<sub>St</sub> D59C was mutated back to wild type in COOT<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">74</xref></sup>. All 4 chains were changed to poly-Ala peptides and the side chains of each residue were rebuilt. Structure refinement was performed using phenix.real_space_refine application in PHENIX<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">75</xref></sup> in real space with secondary structure and geometry restraints.</p>
<p>The model was refined against the final map at a resolution of 3.29 Å after sharpening using PHENIX auto_sharpen program default setting<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref></sup>. A cation Na<sup>+</sup> was modeled in the density between helices-II and -IV in COOT. After runs of refinement and remodeling, in total, 417 residues of MelB<sub>St</sub> (positions 2-210, 219-355, and 364-432), with 6 unassigned side-chains at the C-terminal domain (Leu293, Tyr355, Arg363, Tyr369, Tyr396, and Met410) due to the map disorder, 122 residues of Nb725_4 (2-123), 229 residues of NabFab H-chain (1-214), and 210 residues of NabFab L-chain (4-213), were modeled, respectively. There are three MelB<sub>St</sub> regions with missing densities including the middle loop righter after the Nb binding site (positions 211-218), loop<sub>10-11</sub> (356-361), and the C-terminal tail after residue Tyr432. In addition, the densities between positions 219-230 and the regions close to the missing densities at loop<sub>10-11</sub> are very weak. There is no unexplained density that can be clearly modeled by lipids. Statistics of the map reconstruction and model refinement can be found in <bold>sTable 1</bold>. The model-map fitting quality was evaluated by <italic>Q</italic> score program<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>.

<title>All-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations</title>
<p>All-atom MD simulations were performed taking the inward-facing CryoEM structure as the starting model. Atom coordinates in the loops missing from the CryoEM structure were filled in using homology modeling with the Modeller software package<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">77</xref></sup>. Subsequently, the protein was embedded into a lipid bilayer composed of 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl phosphatidylethanolamine (POPE), 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl phosphatidylglycerol (POPG), and cardiolipin (CDL), in a molar ratio of 7:2:1 for POPE:POPG:CDL, mimicking the membrane composition of <italic>E. coli.</italic> Each side of the lipid bilayer was then enclosed by a box of water molecules with 25 Å thickness. Sodium chloride ions were introduced among these water molecules to yield a solution with an approximate concentration of 0.16 M. The system setup was performed via the CHARMMGUI<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">78</xref></sup> web interface. The all-atom MD simulations for the outward-facing MelB<sub>St</sub> under the same setup have been reported by constructing through an in-silico mutation, converting the outward-facing crystal structure of the D59C MelB<sub>St</sub> mutant (PDB ID 7L16) back to the WT MelB <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup>. In both the inward and outward-facing configurations, a sodium ion was initially situated in the binding site, while melibiose was notably absent from the system. Each system underwent initial optimization where the heavy atoms of proteins and lipids were harmonically restrained, employing a force constant of 1000 kJ/mol/Å<sup>2</sup>. This was followed by 100 picoseconds (ps) of dynamics at a temperature of 300 K in the constant NVT ensemble. Subsequently, the restraints were gradually reduced during 10 ns of dynamics in the constant NPT ensemble, maintained at a temperature of 300 K and pressure of 1 atm. For equilibration, we carried out an additional 30 ns of dynamics in the NPT ensemble under the same conditions, but without any restraints. After the equilibration stage, 1 μs of dynamics was performed in the constant NPT ensemble, under the same temperature and pressure, to generate the production trajectories. We maintained the temperature using a Langevin thermostat with a friction coefficient of 1 ps<sup>-1</sup>. The trajectory was propagated with a timestep of 2 femtoseconds (fs), and all bonds involving a hydrogen atom were constrained. The CHARMM36 force field<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">79</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">81</xref></sup> was utilized to simulate the protein, lipid, and ions throughout all simulations. Electrostatic interactions were calculated using the particle mesh Ewald method, with a tolerance of 5 x 10<sup>-4</sup>. We set the cutoff for van der Waals interactions at 12 Å. The TIP3P model<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">82</xref></sup> was used to treat water molecules and ions. All classical MD simulations were performed using the OPENMM<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">83</xref></sup> software package.</p>

<title>Hydrogen-deuterium exchange coupled to mass spectrometry (HDX-MS)</title>
<p>In-solution pairwise HDX-MS experiment was performed to study the structural dynamics of MelB<sub>St</sub>. Labeling, quenching, lipids removal, and online digestion were achieved using a fully automated manner using HDx3 extended parallel system (LEAP Technologies, Morrisville, NC)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">84</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">85</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Working samples of MelB<sub>St</sub> and MelB<sub>St</sub> complexed with Nb725_4 were prepared to a concentration of 50.0 μM for MelB<sub>St</sub> and 100 μM for Nb725_4 in a buffer of 25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.01% DDM in H<sub>2</sub>O. Aliquots of 4 µl of each working sample were diluted by 10-fold into the labeling buffer of 25 mM Tris-HCl, pD 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.01% DDM in D<sub>2</sub>O. The reactions were incubated in D<sub>2</sub>O buffer at 20 °C for multiple time points (30 sec, 300 sec, and 3000 sec) in triplicates and non-deuterated controls were prepared in a similar manner except H<sub>2</sub>O buffer was used in the labeling step. The pH of the labeling buffer was measured with a pH meter mounted with a glass electrode and then corrected to pD (pD = pH + 0.4).</p>
<p>The reactions were quenched at given time points by adding the same volume of ice-cold 6 M urea, 100 mM citric acid, pH, 2.3 in water for 180 seconds at 0 °C and immediately subjected to a lipid filtration module containing ZrO<sub>2</sub> available on the LEAP PAL system. After incubation of 60 sec, the LEAP X-Press then compressed the filter assembly to separate proteins from the ZrO2 particles-bound phospholipids and detergents. The filtered protein sample was injected into a cool box for online digestion and separation.</p>
<p>LC/MS bottom-up HDX was performed using a Thermo Scientific™ Ultimate™ 3000 UHPLC system and Thermo Scientific<sup>TM</sup> Orbitrap Eclipse<sup>TM</sup> Tribrid<sup>TM</sup> mass spectrometer. Samples were digested with a Nepenthesin-2 (Affipro, Czech Republic) column at 8 °C for 180 sec and then trapped in a 1.0 mm x 5.0 mm, 5.0 µm trap cartridge for desalting. Peptides were then separated on a Thermo Scientific™ Hypersil Gold<sup>TM</sup>, 50 x1 mm, 1.9 µm, C18 column with a gradient of 10 % to 40 % gradient (A: water, 0.1 % formic acid; B: acetonitrile, 0.1 % formic acid) gradient for 15 minutes at a flow rate of 40 µL/min. To limit carry-over issues, a pepsin wash was added in between runs. To limit the back-exchange of hydrogen, all of the quenching, trapping, and separation steps were performed at near 0 °C.</p>
<p>For data analysis, a nonspecific digested peptide database was created for MelB<sub>St</sub> with separate tandem mass spectrometry measurements of non-deuterated samples. Digested peptides from undeuterated MelB<sub>St</sub> protein were identified on the orbitrap mass spectrometer using the same LC gradient as the HDX-MS experiment with a combination of data-dependent and targeted HCD-MS2 acquisition. Using the Thermo BioPharma Finder software (v 5.1), MS2 spectra were matched to the MelB<sub>St</sub> sequence with fixed modifications. Altogether 153 peptide assignments (confident HDX data cross all labeling times) were confirmed for MelB <sub>St</sub> samples giving 86% sequence coverage. MS data files were processed using the Sierra Analytics HDExaminer software with the MelB<sub>St</sub> peptide database. Following the automated HDX-MS analysis, manual curation was performed. Upon the completion of the data review, a single charge state with high-quality spectra for all replicates across all HDX labeling times was chosen to represent HDX for each peptide. Differential HDX data were tested for statistical significance using the hybrid significance testing criteria method with an in-house MATLAB script, where the HDX differences at different protein states were calculated (ΔD = D<sub>Nb725_4-bound</sub> – D<sub>Nb-free</sub>). D denotes deuteration, defined as the mass increase above the average mass of the undeuterated peptide. Mean HDX differences from the three replicates were assigned as significant according to the hybrid criteria based on the pooled standard deviation and Welch’s t-test with P &lt; 0.01. The statistically significant differences observed at each residue (ie., ΔD ≥ 0.3184 for this study) were used to map HDX consensus effects based on overlapping peptides onto the structure models. Residue-level data analysis was performed using a built-in function in BioPharma Finder software. The parameters included the number of simulations of 200, recorded solutions of 20, Chi2 increase by the larger of smooth absolute of 0, smother relative of 2, differential absolute of 0, and differential relative of 2.</p>

<p>In an <bold>important</bold> study that will be of interest to the mechanistic membrane transport community, the authors capture the first cryo-EM structure of the inward facing melbiose transporter MelB, a well-studied model transporter from the major facilitator (MFS) superfamily. Cryo-EM experiments and supporting biophysical experiments provide <bold>solid</bold> evidence for transporter conformational changes.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The current study reports a cryo-EM structure of MFS transporter MelB trapped in an inward-facing state by a conformationally selective nanobody. The authors compare this structure to previously-resolved crystal structures of outward-facing MelB. Additionally, the authors report H/D exchange/ mass spec experiments that identify accessible residues in the protein.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors overcame very significant technical challenges to solve the first inward-facing structure of the small, model MFS transporter MelB by cryo-EM. The use of conformation-trapping nanobodies (which had been reported previously by this group) is particularly nice.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The authors highlight the use of HDX experiments as a measurement of protein conformational dynamics. However, the experiment instead measures the accessibility of different residues. An ideal experiment would trap the transporter in inward- and outward states, but only the inward conformation is trapped here. The outward-facing conformation is instead an ensemble of outward and occluded conformations. It seems obvious that this will be more dynamic than the nanobody-trapped inward state.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The manuscript authored by Lan Guan and colleagues reveals the structure of the cytosol-facing conformation of the MelB sodium/Li coupled permease using the nab-Fab approach and cryoEM for structure determination. The study reveals the conformational transitions in the melB transport cycle and allows understanding of the role of sugar and ion specificities within this transporter.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The study employs a very exciting strategy of transferring the CDRS of a conformation specific nano body to the nab-fab system to determine the inward-open structure of MelB. The resolution of the structure is reasonable enough to support the major conclusions of the study. This is a well-executed study.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>It is somewhat speculative that the structure represents the EIIa-bound regulatory state. There's a strong enough case that it should be analyzed in the discussion, but I don't think it is firmly established. Therefore, the title of the paper should be changed.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Our answer: Thank you for the comment. We have changed the title to “Mobile barrier mechanisms for Na+-coupled symport in an MFS sugar transporter”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Reading through the manuscript, it was challenging to distinguish what is new in the current manuscript and what has been done previously. There were a lot of parts where it was hard for me to identify the main point of the current study among all the details of previous studies. It would also benefit from shortening. For example:</p>
<p>-Page 6: Nb725 binding has already been characterized extensively in the very nice JBC paper earlier this year. It's important to test 725-4 for binding, but since it doesn't change the binding interaction, and probably wouldn't be expected to, the entire section could be written more succinctly. The main point, which is that 725-4 behaves like 725, is lost among all the details</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Our answer: Thanks for this instructive suggestion. We have shortened the description in this section.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>-Page 9-10. I don't understand what summarizing all of the results from the previous D59C studies adds to the current story. It's important because it provides an indication of the substrate binding site, but its mechanism of action does not seem relevant to the current work.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Our answer: We have shortened the description of the sugar-binding site and moved the previous Fig. 3b to supplementary figure sFig. 11. According to your comment about showing the location of the binding sites, which is also suggested by Reviewer #2, we modified Fig. 3 and added two panels to map the location of the bound Na+ in the inward-facing structure and the bound sugar in the outward-facing structure.</p>
<p>The sugar-binding site identified in the published structure is critical to construct the mobile barrier mechanism. The sugar-binding residues identified in the published structure provided essential data to support the conclusion that the sugar-binding pocket is broken in the inward-facing structure. Thus, this published structure is mechanistically relevant to the current study.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>-Page 12. Too much summary of the previous outward structure. Since this is already part of the literature, it would be more efficient to reference the previous data when it is important to interpret the new data (or show as a figure).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Our answer: The introduction of the previous sugar-binding sit is important for the detailed comparison between the two states as discussed above, but we agree with this reviewer and have significantly shortened the paragraph by moving the detailed description into the legend to the sFig. 11.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>-Instead of providing the PDB ID in figures of the current structure, just say &quot;current work&quot; or similar. Then it is obvious you are not citing a previous structure.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Our answer: To distinguish clearly the new data and published results, the citation of the cryoEM structure [PDP ID 8T60] has been completely removed from the main text but kept in sTable 1.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>-An entire panel of Figure 3 is dedicated to ligand binding in a previous outward-facing structure.</p>
<p>Showing it in the overlay would be sufficient.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Our answer: It is the first time for us to show a structure with a bound-Na+. Fig. 3 also illustrates the spatial relationship between the sugar-binding pocket and the cation-binding pocket since both binding sites are determined now. As stated above, according to two reviewers’ comments, we have modified the Figures and the Fig. 3d is the overlay.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Please increase the size of the font in all figures. It should be 6-8 point when printed on a standard sheet of paper. Labels in Figure 3, distances in Figure 4, and everything in Figure 5 is hard to see.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Our answer: Thank you for the comments and the enlargement of the figure size and label font in all figures have been made.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Figure 2: would be helpful to show Figure S8 in the main text, orienting the reader to the approximate location of substrate binding. What is known about the EIIA-Glc binding interface? Has anyone probed this by mutagenesis? Where are these residues on the overall structure, and are they somewhere other than the nanobody interface?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Our answer: Thank you for this comment. We have added a panel for orienting the readers about the substrate location in MelB in Figure 3c. The sFig. 8 actually focuses on the details of Nb interactions with MelB. Our current data strongly supported the notion that the Nb-bound MelBSt structure mimics the EIIAGlc-bound MelB but is not structurally resolved, so we have tuned down our statement on EIIAGlc. There is one study suggesting the C-terminal tail helix may be involved in the EIIAGlc binding, which has been added to the discussion.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Can Figure 5 be split into 2 figures and simplified?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Our answer: thanks for the suggestion. We have split it into Figs. 5b and 6 and also moved the peptide mapping to the Fig 5a.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>What is the difference between cartoon and ribbon rendering?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Our answer: Ribbon: illustrating the structure; cartoon: highlighting the positions with statistically significant protection or deprotection. The statistically significant changes are implied by the ribbon representation; Sphere: not covered by labeled peptides.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Can the panels showing the kinetic data be enlarged? I don't think they need to surround the molecule. An array underneath would be fine.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Our answer: We have enlarged all figures and labels. The placement of selected plots around the model could clearly show the difference in deuterium uptake rates between the transmembrane domain and extra-membrane regions. We will maintain this arrangement.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Do colors in panel A correspond with colors in panel B?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Our answer: The color usage in both are different. Now the two panels have been separated.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Do I understand correctly that in the HDX experiments, negative values indicate positions that exchange more quickly in the nanobody-free protein relative to the nanobody-bound protein?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Our answer: Your understanding is correct.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>I assume some of this is due to the protein changing conformation, but some of it might be due to burial at the nanobody-binding interface. Can those peptides be indicated?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Our answer: Thank you for this comment. We have marked the peptide carrying the Nb-binding residues on uptake plots in Figs.6 and Extended Fig. 1. There are only three Nb-binding residues covered by many overlapping peptides. Most are not covered, either not carried by the labeled peptides (Tyr205, Ser206, and Ser207) or with insignificant changes (Pro132 and Thr133), except for Asp137, Lys138, and Arg141 which are presented in 8 labeled peptides.</p>
<p>Few buried positions in the outward-facing state are expected to be solvent in the inward-facing state; unfortunately, inward-facing state they are buried by Nb binding.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Make figure legends easier to interpret by removing non-essential methods details (like buffer conditions).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Our answer: We removed the detailed method descriptions in most figure legends. Thank you.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Check throughout for typos.</p>
<p>ie page 9 Lue Leu</p>
<p>Page 9 like likely</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Our answer: We have corrected them. Thank you!</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>I have mostly minor questions/remarks.</p>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Why not do the hdx-ms experiments in the presence of sugar? That would give a proper distinction between two conformational states, instead of an ensemble of states vs one state.</p>
</list-item></list>
</disp-quote>
<p>Our answer: MelB conformation induced by sugar is also multiple states, and likely most are outward-facing states and occluded intermediate states. This is also supported by the new finding of an inward state with low sugar affinity. The ideal design should be one inward and one outward to understand the inward-outward transition. We have not identified an outward-facing mutant while we can obtain the inward by the Nb. WT MelBSt with bound Na+ favors the outward-facing state. Although our design is not ideal, we do have one state vs a predominant outward-facing WT with bound Na+.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Minor comments:</p>
<p>• Fig 5 is misleading as the peptide number does not match with the amino acid sequence. I would suggest putting a heat map with coverage on top. Or showing deuterium uptake per peptide. See examples below.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Our answer: The peptide number should not match with sequence number. We have 155 overlapping peptides that cover the entire amino acid sequence including the 10-His tag, and there are 60 residues with no data because they are not covered by a labeled peptide. The residue positions that are covered by peptides are estimated by bars on the top. The cylinder length does not correspond to the length of the transmembrane helix, just for mapping purposes.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Can the authors explain how they found that the Nbs bind to the cytoplasmic side (before obtaining the structure)?</p>
</list-item></list>
</disp-quote>
<p>Our answer: Our in vivo two-hybrid assay between the Nb and MelBSt indicated their interaction on the cytoplasmic surface of MelBSt, which is further confirmed by the melibiose fermentation and transport assay, where the transport activities were completely inhibited by intracellularly coexpressed Nb and MelBSt. Thanks for raising this question.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>•  The authors use the word &quot;substrate&quot; indifferently for sugar and Na+ binding, which is a bit confusing. Technically, only sugar is the substrate and Na+ is a ligand, or cotransported-ion, that powers the reaction of transport. This might sound like nit-picking but it can lead to misunderstandings (at some point I thought two sugars were transported, and then I was looking for the second Na+ binding site).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Our answer: We used to call the sugar and Na as co-substrate but we agree with this comment.</p>
<p>We have changed by using substrate for the cargo sugar and coupling cation for the driving cation.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>•  Abstract &quot;only the inner barrier&quot; - the is missing.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks. We have corrected this.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>•  p.3 intro &quot;and identified that the positive cooperativity of cation and melibiose, &quot; something is missing.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks again. We missed the “as the core symport mechanism”.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>•  P.6 Nb275_4 instead of Nb725_4</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you very much for your careful reading.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>•  P.7. Also, affinity affinities</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you very much. We changed to “; and also, the -NPG affinity decreased by 21~32-fold for both Nbs”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>•  P.8 &quot; contains 417 MelBSt residues (positions 2-210, 219-355, and 364-432). This does not sum up to 417 residues.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks for your critical reading. We changed 364-432 to 262-432.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>•  p.9 Lue 54</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have corrected it to Leu54.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>•  I find fig.3 hard to read. Can the authors show the Na+ binding pockets and sugar binding pockets within the structure? Especially figure 3b. why are the residues in different colors?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Our answer: We have moved Fig 3b into sFig. 11. We colored the residues in the previous Fig 3B to match the hosting helices. We have added two panels to show the location of both sugar and Na in the molecular. Thank you for your comments.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>•  Fig4 bcef. Colored circles at the end of the helices. What are they for?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Our answer: We revised the legend. “The paired helices involved in either barrier formation were highlighted in the same colored circles.”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>•  86% coverage includes the his-tag - it would be good to clarify that.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Our answer: Yes, it includes the 10-His tag.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>•  Fig.7 - anti clockwise cycle of transport is counter-intuitive.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Our answer: We have re-arranged. Our model was constructed originally to explain efflux due to limited information at the earlier state. Now more data are available allowing us to explain inflow and active transport.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>•  Where are all the uptake plots per peptide for the HDX-MS data?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Our answer: We have added the course raw data and prepared all uptake plots for all 71 peptides with statistically significant changes as an Extended Fig. 1.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>•  P.22 protein was concentrated to 50 mg/mL. Really? That is a lot.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This is correct. We can even concentrate MelBSt protein to greater than 50 mg/ml.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>•  Have the authors looked into the potential role of lipids in regulating the conformational transition? Since the structure was obtained in nanodiscs, have they observed some unexplained densities? The role of lipid-protein interactions in regulating such transitions was observed for several transporters including MFS (Gupta K, et al. The role of interfacial lipids in stabilizing membrane protein oligomers. Nature. 2017 10.1038/nature20820. Martens C, et al. Direct protein-lipid interactions shape the conformational landscape of secondary transporters. Nat Commun. 2018 10.1038/s41467-018-06704-1.). Furthermore, I see the authors have already observed lipid specific functional regulation of MelB (ref: Hariharan, P., et al BMC Biol 16, 85 (2018). <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s12915-018-0553-0">https://doi.org/10.1186/s12915-018-0553-0</ext-link>). A few words about this previous work, and even commenting on the absence of lipid-protein interactions in this current work is worthwhile.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Our answer: Thanks for this very relevant comment. We paid attention to the unmodelled densities. There is one with potential but it is challenging to model it. We have added a sentence “There is no unexplained density that can be clearly modeled by lipids.” in the method to address this concern.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>1. In the following sentence, the authors report high errors for the Kd value. The anti-Fab Nb binding to NabFab was two-fold poorer than Nb725_4 at a Kd value of 0.11 {plus minus} 0.16 μM. The figure however indicates that the error value is 0.016 µM. Pls correct.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Our answer: Thank you. You are correct. The error has been corrected. 0.16 ± 0.02 uM. In this revised manuscript, we present the data in nM units.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. Is the stoichiometry of the MelB:Na+ symport clearly known in this transporter. It can be mentioned in the discussion with appropriate references.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Our answer: Yes, the stoichiometry of unity has been clearly determined, which was included in the second paragraph of the previous version.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. In the last section of results, the authors seem to suggest a greater movement within their Cterminal helical bundle compared to N-terminal helices. Is there evidence to suggest an asymmetry in the rocker switch between the two states of the transporter?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Our answer: Our structural data revealed that the C-terminal bundle is more dynamic compared with the N-terminal bundle where hosts the residues for specific binding of galactoside and Na+. The HDX data showed that the most dynamic regions are the structurally unresolved C-terminal tail by either method, the conserved tail helix and the middle-loop helix. transmembrane helices are relatively less dynamic with similar distributions on both transmembrane bundles. Since the most dynamic regions are peripheral element associated with the C-terminal domain, it might give a wrong impression. With regard to the symmetric or asymmetric movement, which will certainly affect the dynamic interactions between the transporter and the lipids, we favor the notion that MelBSt performs symmetric movement during the rocker switch between inward and outward states at the least cost for the protein-lipids interaction.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. Figure 1. Are the thermograms exothermic or endothermic? clarify</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Our answer: In our thermograms, all positive peaks are exothermic due to the direct detection of the heat release by the TA instrument. We clarified this in Method and now we stress this in figure legends to avoid confusion.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. Figure 4a,d. Please put in a membrane bilayer and depict cytosolic and extracellular compartments for clarity.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you. We have added a bilayer and labeled the sidedness in this figure and other related figures.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. Fig 7. Melibiose symport cannot be referred to as Melibiose efflux transport in the legend as the latter refers to antiport. Pls rectify.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Our answer: Influx and efflux are conventionally used to describe the direction of movement of a substrate. The use of symport and antiport indicates the directions of the coupling reaction for the cargo and cation. For the symporter MelB, melibiose efflux means that sugar with the coupled cation moves out, which is driven by the melibiose concentration. During the steady state of melibiose active transport, efflux rate = influx rate.</p>

<p>1. Page 11 &quot;A common feature of carrier transporters&quot;. The authors can use either carriers or transporters. Need not use both simultaneously.</p>
