<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Sleep associated memory consolidation and reactivation play an important role in language acquisition and learning of new words. However, it is unclear to what extent properties of word learning difficulty impact sleep associated memory reactivation. To address this gap, we investigated in twenty-two young healthy adults the effectiveness of auditory targeted memory reactivation (TMR) during non-rapid eye movement sleep of artificial words with easy and difficult to learn phonotactical properties. Here, we found that TMR of the easy words improved their overnight memory performance, whereas TMR of the difficult words had no effect. By comparing EEG activities after TMR presentations, we found an increase in slow wave density independent of word difficulty, whereas the spindle-band power nested during the slow wave up-states - as an assumed underlying activity of memory reactivation - was significantly higher in the easy/effective compared to the difficult/ineffective condition. Our findings indicate that word learning difficulty by phonotactics impacts the effectiveness of TMR and further emphasize the critical role of prior encoding depth in sleep associated memory reactivation.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Learning of new words is essential in language acquisition. During the learning process of unknown words, top-down influences can facilitate perception and encoding of these words depending on the similarity between the new words and the pre-existing knowledge. For example, previous studies have shown that artificial words with similar phonotactic properties to real words are easier to learn and to remember<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>, suggesting that pre-existing knowledge about the sound structure (i.e. schemas) facilitates encoding and consolidation of new words. A synchronized interplay between the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, hippocampus and unimodal associative cortices is proposed to explain schema instantiation and schema mnemonic effects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup> at the neural level. To describe the influence of phonology on memory processing within this framework, new words with phonetic structure congruent to activated schema variables are inserted with less cognitive effort and difficulty into pre-existing knowledge networks of long-term memory in contrast to schema-incongruent words.</p>
<p>According to the complementary system account by Gaskell and colleagues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>, learning of new words comprises a first stage of rapid initial familiarization represented by neural activities of the medial temporal lobe and a second stage of slow offline consolidation of the neocortex. The model suggests that, after initial hippocampal learning, through sleep consolidation memory representations of the words are gradually integrated into long-term lexical and phonological memory structures of the neocortex. Additionally, these processes of memory consolidation might depend on spontaneous and repeated reactivation of the newly formed memory traces during non-rapid eye-movement (NREM) sleep<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>. The active system consolidation hypothesis proposes synchronized hippocampal sharp-wave-ripples, thalamocortical sleep spindles and slow oscillations as underlying activities of memory reactivation during sleep. Accordingly, studies in humans<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup> and in rodent models<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup> found that sleep spindles and hippocampal sharp wave ripples occur grouped during slow oscillations and that these events correlate with memory consolidation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>While similarity of the learning material to pre-existing knowledge clearly facilitates encoding, this notion is controversial for the effects on sleep consolidation. For example, Havas and co-authors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup> tested learning and consolidation of artificial words phonologically derived either from participant’s native language (L1 words in Spanish) or foreign language (L2 words in Hungarian). Here, sleep-associated improvements in memory recognition were only observable in the condition of the L2 words, suggesting that a reduced similarity to pre-existing knowledge facilitates consolidation during sleep. Also, in a study by Payne et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>, sleep-associated memory benefits occurred only for semantically unrelated word-pairs, but not for semantically related words.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Zion and colleagues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup> reported that sleep facilitated consolidation in a second language learning task in participants with a higher degree of meta-linguistic knowledge, indicating a beneficial effect of pre-existing knowledge on new word consolidation. Similarly, Durrant and colleagues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup> reported that only schema-conformant but not non-conformant learnings benefitted from sleep. In a study from our own lab, German-participants learning unknown Dutch vocabulary profited more from sleep compared to native French speaker when given the same amount of learning trials, whereas German native speakers might have more pre-existing knowledge about the Dutch words in relation to the French native speakers, which facilitated learning and consolidation of the new Dutch vocabulary<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>A promising approach to examine sleep-associated memory consolidation is to experimentally bias reactivation by re-presenting olfactory<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup> or auditory<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup> reminder cues during sleep, a technique known as targeted memory reactivation (TMR). TMR has been related to elevated slow-wave and spindle activity following cueing presentations as neural markers of memory reactivation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>. So far two studies suggest that prior knowledge increase the effectiveness of TMR: Groch and colleagues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup> reported improved memory performance by TMR for associations between pseudo-words and familiar objects, but not for word associations of new/unknown objects. Here, before sleep subjects showed as well better encoding performance for the familiar compared to the unknown objects. In another study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup> of learning sound-object locations, the effectiveness of TMR correlated positively with the initial encoding performance prior to sleep. Additionally, both studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup> found significant associations between TMR’s effectiveness and sleep spindle activities after the cueing presentations. These findings suggest that higher similarity between the learning material and the pre-existing knowledge facilitates reactivation and consolidation during sleep. However, it is unknown whether these findings can be generalized to learning of new artificial words with different levels of phonotactical similarity to prior word-sound knowledge, as a factor of learning difficulty.</p>
<p>To address this issue, we designed artificial words with varying difficulty levels by phonotactical properties. Healthy young participants learned to categorize these words into rewarded and unrewarded words. By using auditory TMR, we re-presented the artificial words during subsequent sleep to study its effect on categorization performance. As a manipulation check, we expect that artificial words with more familiar phonotactical properties would be easier to learn compared to words with less familiarity. Regarding previous findings<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>, we hypothesized higher effectiveness of TMR for the easy to learn words in comparison to the difficult words, accompanied by higher oscillatory activity on the slow-wave and spindle range.</p>

<title>Experimental design</title>
<p>To study the impact of difficulty in word learning on TMR, we created a novel learning paradigm. Here, we formed four sets of artificial words (40 words per set) consisting of different sequences of two vowels and two consonants (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>). Comparison analyses between the sets revealed significant differences in phonotactic probability (PP; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>; unpaired <italic>t</italic>-tests: G1 / G2 &gt; G3 / G4, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.005). PP quantifies the frequency of a single phoneme (phoneme probabilities) or a sequence of phonemes (e.g., biphone probabilities) within a language and thus serves as a measurement of the similarity between the artificial words and the pre-existing real word knowledge. According to distinct levels of PP, we paired the four sets to the high-(G1 &amp; G2) and low-PP (G3 &amp; G4) condition, respectively.</p>

<p>During encoding, we trained the subjects to discriminate the artificial words based on reward associations by manual button presses. Therefore, the high- and the low-PP condition, consisted of 40 rewarded and 40 non-rewarded words. After the auditory presentation of the word and the button press response, subjects received feedback at the end of each trial (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>). In terms of the signal detection theory<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>, the responses with regard to the reward associations of the words were assigned to the following four response types: hits (rewarded, correct); correct rejections (correct, unrewarded); misses (rewarded, incorrect); and false alarms (unrewarded, incorrect) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d</xref>). Dependent on responses, subjects received money points. By three presentations of each word in randomized order, they were trained to categorize the artificial words.</p>
<p>After encoding and before sleep, we tested the pre-sleep memory performance (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1e</xref>). Subjects slept one night in the sleep laboratory and during non-REM sleep stages 2 &amp; 3 we conducted auditory TMR of the low-PP words in one group of subjects and TMR of the high-PP words in the other group (between subject design). At the following morning, we tested the post-sleep memory performance.</p>

<title>Manipulation check based on encoding analyses</title>
<p>To validate our novel paradigm, we examined the influence of PP on encoding performance. Based on the signal detection theory<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>, we calculated sensitivity values (d’) to measure subject’s abilities to differentiate and categorize rewarded and unrewarded words of the two PP conditions over the three presentations of the encoding task (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>). A repeated-measure ANOVA on sensitivity with PP (high vs. low) and presentations (1 to 3) as within-subjects factors revealed significant main effects of PP (<italic>F</italic>(1,32) = 5.13, <italic>p</italic> = 0.03), and presentations (<italic>F</italic>(2,64) = 95.67, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001). Additional pairwise comparisons between PP conditions showed significant differences after the first presentation (paired <italic>t</italic>-tests of the three presentations in order: (1) <italic>t</italic>(32) = 0.73, <italic>p</italic> = 0.47; (2) <italic>t</italic>(32) = 2.35, <italic>p</italic> = 0.03; (3) <italic>t</italic>(32) = 2.17, <italic>p</italic> = 0.04). These results indicate superior learning performance for words with high-compared to words with low-PP.</p>

</fig>
<p>To examine the oscillatory correlates of encoding performance, we conducted time-frequency analyses time-locked to auditory word representations (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref>) and extracted power values over time, frequency, and EEG electrodes by using wavelet transformations (see methods). This analysis revealed a strong desynchronization after word presentations (0.7 to 1.9 s to stimulus onset) in the frequency range of the alpha waves (8-13 Hz) and pronounced over parietal and occipital electrodes in contrast to baseline activity (−1 to −0.1 s to stimulus onset; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref>, right panel). Testing whether changes in alpha desynchronization correspond to increased encoding performance over repetitive presentations, a repeated-measure ANOVA on alpha power values merged over central electrodes (Pz, Cz) including presentations (1 to 3) as a single within-subjects factor revealed a significant increase in alpha desynchronization (<italic>F</italic>(2,64) = 4.19, <italic>p</italic> = 0.02).</p>
<p>Regarding distinct levels of encoding performance between high- and low-PP, we compared next changes in alpha desynchronization between these conditions. Here, we obtained the changes in power values by subtracting the first from the second and third presentation for the high- and low-PP condition, respectively. Cluster-based statistics of the third presentation revealed a significant cluster over the left posterior electrodes with a stronger alpha power decrease for the high- in contrast to the low-PP condition (time window: 0.7 to 1.9s; frequency range 8-13Hz; averaged <italic>t</italic>-value over the 5 cluster electrodes = −2.69, <italic>p</italic> = 0.01; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref>). A repeated-measure ANOVA on alpha power changes (merged over Pz and Cz electrodes) with PP (high vs. low) and presentations (2 to 3) as within-subjects factors revealed a main effect of PP (<italic>F</italic>(1,32) = 5.42, <italic>p</italic> = 0.03), and a significant interaction (<italic>F</italic>(1,32) = 7.38, <italic>p</italic> = 0.01) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d</xref>). Post-hoc pairwise comparison between PP conditions showed significant difference of the third presentation (paired <italic>t</italic>-tests of presentations in order: (2) <italic>t</italic>(32) = −0.36, <italic>p</italic> = 0.72; (3) <italic>t</italic>(32) = −3.55, <italic>p</italic> = 0.001) and a <italic>t</italic>-test against 0 revealed significantly decreased activity in high-PP of the third presentation (<italic>t</italic>(32) = −2.92, <italic>p</italic> = 0.006). In addition to the behavior results, these EEG results indicate differences between PP conditions in desynchronization of alpha oscillations, as an assumed neural correlate of encoding depth. To summarize, as a manipulation check based on encoding analyses, we confirmed that the conditions of high- and low-PP corresponds to distinct levels in learning difficulty.</p>

<title>TMR affects memory consolidation of the easy to learn words</title>
<p>To examine whether TMR during sleep impacts memory consolidation with respect to learning difficulty, we calculated the overnight changes by subtracting the pre- from the post-sleep memory performance of the high- and low-PP conditions. Conducting <italic>t</italic>-tests against 0 revealed a significant increase in the TMR/cueing condition of high-PP (high-PP cued: 0.24 ± 0.1, <italic>t</italic>(10) = 2.44, <italic>p</italic> = 0.035), while the memory performance remained unchanged in all the other conditions (low-PP cued: −0.09 ± 0.08, <italic>t</italic>(10) = −1.16, <italic>p</italic> = 0.27; high-PP uncued: 0 ± 0.08, <italic>t</italic>(10) = −0.04, <italic>p</italic> = 0.97; low-PP uncued: 0.03 ± 0.1, <italic>t</italic>(10) = 0.31, <italic>p</italic> = 0.76; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>). An additional two-way mixed design ANOVA on the same values with cueing as a between-subject factor (cued vs. uncued) and learning difficulty as a within-subject factor (high- vs. low-PP) showed no significant results (cueing: <italic>F</italic>(1,20) = 0.5, <italic>p</italic> = 0.49; learning difficulty: <italic>F</italic>(1,20) = 2.37, <italic>p</italic> = 0.14; cueing x learning difficulty: <italic>F</italic>(1,20) = 3.62, <italic>p</italic> = 0.07). Post-hoc pairwise comparisons revealed a significant difference between the high-PP cued and the low-PP cued (high-PP cued vs. low-PP cued: <italic>t</italic>(20) = 2.63, <italic>p</italic> = 0.02), and no significant difference to the other conditions (high-PP cued vs.: high-PP uncued <italic>t</italic>(20) = 1.91, <italic>p</italic> = 0.07; low-PP uncued <italic>t</italic>(10) = 1.55, <italic>p</italic> = 0.15). In additional control analyses, pre-sleep memory performance and vigilance shortly before the post-sleep memory task did not significantly differ between both cueing groups (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbls1">Table S1</xref>).</p>

<p>Next, we explored whether TMR conditions impact biases in decision making. Therefore, we analyzed changes between the pre- and post-sleep memory tasks of c-criterion values as a measurement of risk avoidance/seeking in decision making<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>. Here, we found as well a significant overnight increase in the high-PP cued condition (high-PP cued: 0.2 ± 0.07, <italic>t</italic>(10) = 3.04, <italic>p</italic> = 0.01), indicating an increased bias towards risk avoidance by TMR (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref>), while all the other conditions remained unchanged (high-PP uncued: 0.09 ± 0.06, <italic>t</italic>(10) = 1.4, <italic>p</italic> = 0.19; low-PP cued: 0.08 ± 0.05, <italic>t</italic>(10) = 1.63, <italic>p</italic> = 0.13; low-PP uncued: 0.03 ± 0.05, <italic>t</italic>(10) = 0.56, <italic>p</italic> = 0.59). An ANOVA on c-criterion changes shows no significant effects (cueing: <italic>F</italic>(1,20) = 1.86, <italic>p</italic> = 0.19; learning difficulty: <italic>F</italic>(1,20) = 3.35, <italic>p</italic> = 0.08; cueing x learning difficulty: <italic>F</italic>(1,20) = 0.43, <italic>p</italic> = 0.52). Additional post-hoc pairwise comparisons revealed a significant difference between the high-PP cued and low-PP uncued (high-PP cued vs. low-PP uncued: <italic>t</italic>(10) = 2.43, <italic>p</italic> = 0.04), and no difference to other conditions (high-PP cued vs.: high- PP uncued <italic>t</italic>(20) = 1.28, <italic>p</italic> = 0.22; low-PP cued <italic>t</italic>(20) = 1.57, <italic>p</italic> = 0.13).</p>
<p>Taken together, these results suggest that the effectiveness of TMR depends on the level of difficulty in word learning, while auditory cueing during sleep increases the memory performance of the easy to learn words.</p>

<title>Increased spindle power nested during slow wave up-states in TMR of the easy to learn words</title>
<p>After analyzing TMR’s effectiveness on behavior, we investigated the corresponding neural activities by EEG. By visual inspection of the signals, auditory word presentations during NREM sleep led to broad high-amplitude oscillations, called slow waves (SW; 0.5-3Hz), whereas sleep spindle activity (9-16Hz) with various amplitude occurred preferentially nested during the SW’s up-state phase (see for example traces <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref>).</p>

<p>To statistically analyze whether TMR increases the SW density, we conducted a detection algorithm. To control for individual differences, we included 30% of SW with the highest amplitude per subject (see methods) in subsequent analyses. Testing changes of SW density in time windows of 0.5s, revealed significant increases after stimulus onset in comparison to baseline (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b</xref>; baseline period of −1.5 to 0s before stimulus onset; <italic>t</italic>-tests against 0; 0 to 0.5s: 49.73 ± 14.32%, <italic>t</italic>(21) = 3.47, <italic>p</italic> = 0.002; 0.5 to 1s: 83.44 ± 14.97%, <italic>t</italic>(21) = 5.57, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001; 1.5 to 2s: 40.33 ± 10.67%, <italic>t</italic>(21) = 3.78, <italic>p</italic> = 0.001). Additional comparisons between the TMR conditions of high- and low-PP showed no significant differences in SW density, SW amplitude, number of TMR presentations and other sleep parameters (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbls2">Table S2</xref>). In sum, these results indicate an increase of SW in response to auditory word stimulation independent of difficulty in word learning.</p>
<p>Next, we analyzed whether variations in spindle-band oscillations nested during the SW up- states after auditory TMR – as a neural signature of memory reactivation – differ between the conditions of high- and low-PP. To extract the spindle power during SW up-states, we conducted time-frequency analyses time-locked to the troughs of the detected SW in the time-window from 0 to 6s after auditory presentations. <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4c</xref> shows the grand average analyses per condition, whereas the fast spindle band activity (12-16Hz) nested during SW up-states displayed a topography with maximum power over the central-parietal electrodes. Comparison between PP conditions revealed a significant greater spindle-band power prominent in the frequency range of 11-14Hz during SW up-states of high- in contrast to low-PP (averaged <italic>t</italic>-value over the 5 cluster electrodes = 2.66, <italic>p</italic> = 0.01; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4d</xref>), whereas post-hoc comparison including the individual SW amplitude as a covariate still revealed the significance of this cluster (<italic>t</italic>(20) = 2.38, <italic>p</italic> = 0.03).</p>
<p>These results suggest that successful TMR of the easy to learn words is associated with increased spindle activity nested during SW up-states.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we asked whether learning difficulty of artificial words affects TMR’s effectiveness and its neural activities. After confirming easier encoding of artificial words with high-compared to low phonotactic familiarity, we found that auditory TMR during sleep improved the memory performance of the easy to learn words, whereas cueing of the difficult words had no effect. Correspondingly, at the neural level, we observed that cueing presentations of the easy words induced significant greater spindle-band oscillations nested during SW up-states in comparison to the difficult words. To our knowledge, we present here the first study to address the critical role of learning difficulty by experimental manipulations of phonotactical word properties on TMR’s effectiveness and its neural signatures.</p>
<p>Related to our finding of TMR’s effectiveness of the easy words, previous research in object association learning showed beneficial influences of encoding depth<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup> and prior knowledge<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup> on TMR. Language studies without using TMR revealed that prior knowledge affected sleep dependent memory integration of new words in children<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup> and in adults<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. To explain these critical influences on consolidation during sleep, the model of the complementary systems approach of word learning (CLS)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup> proposes that new word memory temporary encoded in the hippocampus transfer during sleep into cortical structures of lexical and phonological memory for long-term embedding, due to co-activation of both memory systems. Thus, word memory reactivation and consolidation during sleep depend on the hippocampal encoding depth and the cortical prior knowledge in phonotactics. Regarding our results, we suggest facilitated systems co-activation/consolidation of the easy to learn words by auditory cueing during sleep as a manipulation of both factors – via enhanced initial encoding and higher similarity to pre-existing phonotactical knowledge – compared to the difficult to learn words.</p>
<p>Contrary to our results, other studies found better memorization of words with low phonological<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup> and semantical<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup> similarity to pre-existing knowledge after a retention period of sleep compared to words with high similarity. To explain this discrepancy, we could speculate that a very high degree of similarity led to a strong memory formation during wake-encoding, which prevented an additional effect of consolidation during sleep. Indeed, Creery et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup> showed that learned object-location associations only benefited from TMR during sleep when not almost perfectly recalled during prior wake. Here, a moderate encoding depth might benefit most from subsequent sleep consolidation compared to insufficient or almost perfect encoding. Alternatively, the contrary results could be related to characteristics of the learning paradigms (L1-vs. L2-like novel words with associations to objects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>; semantically related vs. unrelated word pairs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>) distinct to our design.</p>
<p>In addition to effectiveness of TMR on memory, we observed a significant change of the decision bias in the cueing condition of the easy to learn words and no overnight changes in the other conditions. Here, subjects became more biased in their decision making to avoid losses of money points. This observation suggests that TMR not only captures specific memory traces of the words and their reward associations, but also decision-making tendencies. In a previous study, Ai and colleagues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup> revealed altered reward-relevant decision preferences by TMR. To what extent concepts of decision-making such as risk avoidance/seeking could be reactivated, transformed, and consolidated by TMR is largely unexplored and might be interesting for future research for example in neuroeconomics.</p>
<p>Correspondent to our behavior results of TMR’s effectiveness, we found significantly higher spindle-band oscillations nested during SW up-states after cueing presentations of the easy in comparison to the difficult words. Accordingly, the active system consolidation hypothesis proposes slow wave - sleep spindle coupling activities as an underlying mechanism of systems consolidation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>. Previous studies reported associations of SW and spindle activities during sleep with the integration of new memories in pre-existing knowledge networks<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>. Strikingly, recent studies by implementing machine learning for EEG decoding revealed that classification accuracy of distinct memory categories peaked above chance level synchronized with SW-spindle coupling events<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>. Here, our results support the assumption of SW-spindle activities as an underlying mechanism of memory reactivation during sleep by providing additional evidence to link successful TMR on behavior to increased spindle activity during SW up-states.</p>
<p>In validation of our novel paradigm, we confirmed easier encoding and better memorization of artificial words with high- in comparison to low-PP, in line with previous studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. These results suggest that participants used their prior knowledge of frequently occurring word-sound patterns to facilitate learning. Regarding the framework of schema theory<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>, processing of incoming words with high-PP might co-activate consistent schemata of prior word sound knowledge and thus may lead to facilitated memory integration and stabilization during encoding in comparison to processing of more inconsistent words with low-PP.</p>
<p>Our EEG analyses of encoding revealed desynchronization of alpha oscillations as a function of learning improvements. Additionally, superior encoding of the high-PP words corresponded to greater alpha desynchronization in comparison to the low-PP words. Consequently, we assume that the suppression of alpha oscillations over parietal and occipital electrodes represent a neural correlate of mnemonic functioning. Accordingly, previous studies linked desynchronization of alpha oscillations to memory processing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup> and memory replay during wake<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>. A study of intracranial electrophysiology in epilepsy ptients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup> showed that neocortical alpha/beta desynchronization precede and predict fast hippocampal gamma activity during learning. The authors propose that these coupled activities represent hippocampal-cortical information transfer important for memory formation. Here, our findings let suggest cortical alpha desynchronization as neural marker of wake mnemonic processing according to distinct levels of difficulty in word learning.</p>
<p>Our study has limitations due to a small sample size and between-subject comparisons. Further, potential influences of phonotactic word properties and the prior encoding depth on TMR cannot be interpreted independently because the conditions of phonotactic word properties impacted already the encoding depth before sleep. To disentangle these potential factors, future studies could include a higher number of encoding trials for the low-PP words to equalize the encoding depth between conditions prior to TMR, as successfully shown in a recent study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. Additionally, a within-subject design with a larger sample size would provide a more robust control of interindividual differences in sleep and cognition.</p>
<p>To conclude, our present study demonstrates that difficulty in word learning as a manipulation of phonotactic properties impacts the effectiveness of TMR. Here, TMR of the easy to learn words facilitates categorization learning while TMR of the difficult words had no effect. Auditory cueing of the easy words induced increased spindle activity during the SW up-states - as an assumed underlying activity of memory reactivation - compared to the difficult words. Thus, our findings suggest that future research and clinical applications to restore language capabilities should consider learning difficulty based on phonotactical word properties as a potential factor of successful TMR, whereas alpha desynchronization during initial learning as a neural marker of encoding depth may serve as a predictor for sleep-associated memory reactivation and consolidation.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="s4a">
<title>Subjects</title>
<p>The study included 39 subjects (29 females) with an age range of 19 to 28 years (M = 22.28 years, SD = 2.04). Participants were recruited from the University of Fribourg community by E-Mail or through advertisements at the campus of the University. Before participation, subjects had to give written informed consent as approved by the Ethical Commission of the Department of Psychology of the University of Fribourg. All participants were German speakers, and no subject had a history of neurological or psychiatric illness. The participants were instructed to keep a normal sleep schedule, to get up in the morning before 8 a.m. and not to consume alcohol and caffeine on experimental days. For participation, subjects either received credit for an undergraduate class and/or monetary compensation.</p>
<p>Data were excluded from subjects who did not reach the minimal learning performance (d-prime during pre-sleep memory test greater than 0.9 in at least one of the two PP conditions) or showed a negative d-prime value in at least one condition (5 and 1 subjects respectively).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4b">
<title>Pre-Learning</title>
<p>Participants arrived at the sleep laboratory at 19:30h. Electrodes for standard polysomnography (32 EEG electrodes, EMG and ECG electrodes) were mounted with two EEG mastoid electrodes. One electrode under the right eye was attached to record eye movements.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4c">
<title>Encoding task</title>
<p>The encoding task started around 21:00h. Subjects learned to discriminate rewarded and unrewarded artificial words by right- and left-hand button presses. During each trial, an initial fixation cross was displayed between 1.7 and 2.3s. Subsequently, concurrent with the onset of a blank screen the sound of an artificial word was played for 0.7 to 1s. After a waiting period (blank screen 2s), a question mark appeared to signal the onset of the response time window (maximal duration 4s). Following the key press response, a feedback screen with the money points of the trial and the current task score appeared for 2s. The learning task contained 480 trials in randomized order according to 160 artificial words with three presentations each.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4d">
<title>Pre-Sleep Memory task</title>
<p>After finishing the encoding task, following a 10-min break, subjects performed the pre-sleep memory task. The memory task had the same trial structure as the encoding task without the last feedback screen. Participants received again money points for correct responses. However, the received amount was only shown at the end of the task. The memory task contains 160 trials according to the 160 artificial words.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4e">
<title>Auditory target memory reactivation during sleep</title>
<p>Following an additional impedance check and re-adjustment of the EEG electrodes, subjects went to bed in a noise and electric shielded cabin of the sleep laboratory. All night sleep periods started with light off between 23:00 and 24:00h. Based on online monitoring of SWS and N2 sleep, artificial words were presented aurally via loudspeakers (sound pressure level 55dB) with a randomized inter-stimulus interval of 8±2s. One group of subjects were exposed to artificial words with low phonotactic probability during sleep, whereas we presented to the other group the high phonotactic probability words (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbls1">Table S1</xref> for number of reactivations). We interrupted word presentations when we observed online an arousal or patterns of REM sleep.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4f">
<title>Post-Sleep Memory task</title>
<p>After sleep and re-adjustment of the EEG, subjects performed the post-sleep memory task (see above the description of the pre-sleep memory task).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4g">
<title>Experimental tasks</title>
<p>All experimental tasks, including sleep reactivation, were conducted by using the E-Prime software (Psychology Software Tools, Sharpsburg, USA). By presentation of practice trials at the beginning, the subject’s understanding of the task was approved. Across all tasks, stimuli were presented in randomized order.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4h">
<title>Stimuli</title>
<p>To create artificial words, we subdivided the alphabet in two groups of consonants (C1: b, c, d, f, g, h, j, k, l, m; C2: n, p, q, r, s, t, v, w, x, z) and vowels (V1: a, e, I; V2: o, u, y). Four-letter-words were created by selecting letters from the vowel and consonant groups according to four different sequences (G1:C1, V1, V2, C2; G2: C1, V1, C2, V2; G3: V1, C1, C2, V2; G4: V1, C1, V2, C2). Artificial words were converted automatically from text to speech files (wav format) by using MATLAB functions (tts.m, audiowrite.m) with the setting of a female computer voice with American English pronunciation. From this pool of 900 stimuli for each rule, we selected 40 artificial words per rule category (4 x 40 words) according to the inclusion criteria: fluent and understandable pronunciation; no meaning; no names; aurally discriminable to other selected words.</p>
<p>Phonotactic probability values were computed for each word by using an online computation platform<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://calculator.ku.edu/phonotactic/about">https://calculator.ku.edu/phonotactic/about</ext-link>) according to an American English lexicon. Between rule category comparison analyses revealed significant differences in phonotactic probabilities between two rules in contrast to the other two rules (see <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4i">
<title>Psychomotor vigilance task</title>
<p>With respect to vigilance after sleep before the post-sleep memory task, a reaction time measurement was conducted by the Psychomotor Vigilance Task (PVT)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>. Each trial began with a fixation cross of a randomized duration between 2 and 10 seconds. Participants were instructed to press the spacebar button with the forefinger of the non-dominant hand as quickly as possible after numbers started to count in milliseconds on the screen. The reaction time was displayed for 1s after the key press. The PVT had a duration of 10 min (see for results <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbls2">Supplementary Table 2</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4j">
<title>Behavior analyses</title>
<p>As a measurement of discrimination learning and memory performance, we calculated sensitivity values (d’=z(hits)-z(false alarms)) according to the signal detection theory<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>. Here, we considered correct trials with gaining of money points as hits and incorrect trials with a loss of money points as false alarms (see <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d</xref>). In addition, we assessed measurements of the response bias (c=−0.5*(z(false alarms)+z(hits))). According to the convention<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>, rates of 0 and 1 were replaced with 0.5/n and with (n-0.5)/n respectively, whereas n corresponds to the number of trials (n=40). Values of sensitivity and response bias were calculated separately for the low- and high-PP condition.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4k">
<title>EEG recordings</title>
<p>We made EEG recordings by using customized 32-Ag/AgCl electrodes at 10-10 locations caps (EASYCAP, Woerthsee-Etterschlag, Germany) and 32 channel amplifiers (Brain Products, Gilching, Germany). Impedances were kept below 10 kΩ. The EEG was recorded with a sampling rate of 500 Hz using Brain Vision Recorder software (Brain Products, Gilching, Germany). Signals were referenced to electrodes at the mastoids. The ocular activity was measured via one EOG channel mounted ∼2 cm below the right eye. Muscle tone was monitored by EMG recordings made under the chin. The following EEG electrodes were used for subsequent wake and sleep analyses: Fp1, Fp2, F3, F4, C3, C4, P3, P4, O1, O2, F7, F8, T7, T8, P7, P8, Fz, Cz and Pz.</p>

<sec id="s4l">
<title>Sleep scoring</title>
<p>Sleep stages NREM1, NREM2, NREM3, wake, and REM sleep were scored manually according to the criteria of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) by monitoring signals of frontal, central, and occipital electrodes over 30 s epochs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup>.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4m">
<title>Preprocessing Wake EEG</title>
<p>Wake EEG were preprocessed using the Fieldtrip toolbox (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://fieldtriptoolbox.org">http://fieldtriptoolbox.org</ext-link>; Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition and Behaviour, Radboud University, Netherlands)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup>. First, raw data signals were re-referenced to averaged mastoid electrodes and filtered (high- and low-pass, 0.5 and 45 Hz). For each trial, data were segmented into epochs (−2 to 4s) time-locked to stimulus onset. After demean and detrend processing steps, noisy trials were identified by visual inspection and discarded from further analyses. We then conducted an independent component analysis (ICA) to identify and reject ICA components impacted by eye blinks and eye movements.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4n">
<title>Preprocessing Sleep EEG</title>
<p>EEG signals during sleep were re-referenced to averaged mastoid electrodes and filtered (high- and low-pass, 0.5 and 35 Hz). To analyze EEG activities of TMR, data were segmented into epochs (−2 to 8s) around the onset of stimuli presentations. After demean and detrend processing, trials with signals distorted by noise and movement artefacts were identified by visual inspection and removed from further analyses.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4o">
<title>Time-Frequency Analysis Wake data</title>
<p>We conducted the time-frequency analyses by using Morlet wavelet analyses implemented in the Fieldtrip toolbox. The number of wavelet cycles was adjusted to 7 cycles. We extracted oscillatory power in the frequency range of 1 to 45 Hz with frequency steps of 0.2 Hz and time steps of 10 ms. All the power values were baseline corrected and transformed to absolute changed values by subtracting the corresponding averaged values of the baseline interval of −1 to −0.1 s before stimulus onset.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4p">
<title>Slow wave-spindle power analyses</title>
<p>To reduce influence of potential confounders on TMR like low prior learning performance and number of reactivations, we included only subjects with a pre-sleep memory performance d’&gt;0.75 in both PP conditions and who did receive a minimal number of 160 reactivations (each word was represented at least two times during sleep). Thus, we excluded 5 and 6 subjects respectively. The final sample for sleep analyses consisted of n = 22 with 11 subjects in each cueing condition.</p>
<p>To detect slow waves, we first localized all negative and positive peaks of the 0.5 to 3Hz band-pass filtered signal during the auditory cueing trials in the time windows of 0 to 6s according to stimulus onsets. In addition, time distance between the prior and posterior positive peaks should be in the range of 0.3 to 2s. For the following analyses, the 30% slow waves with the highest amplitude (from negative peak to posterior positive peak) were included for each subject.</p>
<p>We then extracted the corresponding spectral power (1–30Hz) in a time window around this negative slow wave peak (±2s) using Morlet wavelet (7 cycles) analysis implemented in the Fieldtrip toolbox, with a time window and step size of 10ms and frequency steps of 0.2Hz. Extracted power data over frequency and time was averaged of the slow waves and baseline corrected by subtracting the averaged values of the baseline interval of −2 to −1.5s prior to the negative slow wave peak. Finally, the transformed absolute changed values were plotted for the frequency and time range of interest and different conditions (see <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4c</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4q">
<title>Slow wave density analyses</title>
<p>To analyze the number of slow waves around memory reactivations during sleep, we divided the time course of reactivation trials in equally sized bins with a duration of 0.5s from −1.5 to 3s according to stimulus onset. Based on negative peaks of detected slow waves, we counted the occurring of slow waves for each bin over trials. Subsequently, we computed density values for each bin by division of the number of trials. Finally, we calculated the relative increase in slow wave density in percent by division of the averaged baseline values (bins: −1.5 to 0s; see <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4r">
<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>To test for differences between conditions of wake behavioral data, repeated-measure ANOVAs and paired sample t-tests were used. Two-way mixed design ANOVAs and independent sample t-tests were computed for sleep behavior analyses. For all behavior statistical analyses, the p-value was set at p &lt; 0.05 and all statistical analyses were processed by using MATLAB 2018a (MathWorks, Natick, USA) and SPSS (IBM Corp., Version 25).</p>
<p>Considering the problem of multiple testing in statistics, we applied cluster based permutation tests implemented in the Fieldtrip toolbox<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup> to test for potential differences of EEG time-frequency data. Here, dependent sample t-tests and an independent sample test (for between subject group comparison of sleep data) were conducted. We specified the number of permutations by 1000 and the minimal number of channels by two. The cluster alpha level was set at p = 0.05 for two-tailed testing. Plots with significant clusters of electrodes are shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4d</xref>. After confirming the existence of significant cluster, we conducted an additional repeated-measure ANOVA with averaged values of the identified time and frequency range of interest (see <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d</xref>). To control for SW amplitude size as a potential confounder in spindle activity differences during SW up-states, we extracted and averaged power values of the significant cluster (0.3 to 0.8s; 11-14Hz; Pz, P3, P4, O2, P7) per subject and conducted a post-hoc independent sample t-test based on residuals corrected by individual SW amplitude size.</p>

<p>This study provides <bold>useful</bold> findings on how phonetic properties of words, i.e., their difficulty and prior knowledge, influence the outcome of targeted memory reactivation (TMR) during sleep. Unfortunately, the small sample size together with a between-subject design, renders the evidence <bold>incomplete</bold>, thus warranting future work to shed further light on the impact of TMR in language learning.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
The authors aim to consider the effects of phonotactics on the effectiveness of memory reactivation during sleep. They have created artificial words that are either typical or atypical and showed that reactivation improves memory for the latter but not the former.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
This is an interesting design and a creative way of manipulating memory strength and typicality. In addition, the spectral analysis on both the wakefulness data and the sleep data is well done. The article is clearly written and provides a relevant and comprehensive of the literature and of how the results contribute to it.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
1. Unlike most research involving artificial language or language in general, the task engaged in this manuscript did not require (or test) learning of meaning or translation. Instead, the artificial words were arbitrarily categorised and memory was tested for that categorisation. This somewhat limits the interpretation of the results as they pertain to language science, and qualifies comparisons with other language-related sleep studies that the manuscript builds on.</p>
<p>2. The details of the behavioural task are hard to understand as described in the manuscript. Specifically, I wasn't able to understand when words were to be responded to with the left or right button. What were the instructions? Were half of the words randomly paired with left and half with right and then half of each rewarded and half unrewarded? Or was the task to know if a word was rewarded or not and right/left responses reflected the participants' guesses as to the reward (yes/no)? Please explain this fully in the methods, but also briefly in the caption to Figure 1 (e.g., panel C) and in the Results section.</p>
<p>3. Relatedly, it is unclear how reward or lack thereof would translate cleanly into a categorisation of hits/misses/correct rejections/false alarms, as explained in the text and shown in Figure 1D. If the item was of the non-rewarded class and the participant got it correct, they avoided loss. Why would that be considered a correct rejection, as the text suggests? It is no less of a hit than the rewarded-correct, it's just the trial was set up in a way that limits gains. This seems to mix together signal detection nomenclature (in which reward is uniform and there are two options, one of which is correct and one isn't) and loss-aversion types of studies (in which reward is different for two types of stimuli, but for each type you can have H/M/CR/FA separably). Again, it might all stem from me not understanding the task, but at the very least this required extended explanations. Once the authors address this, they should also update Fig 1D. This complexity makes the results relatively hard to interpret and the merit of the manuscript hard to access. Unless there are strong hypotheses about reward's impact on memory (which, as far as I can see, are not at the core of the paper), there should be no difference in the manner in which the currently labelled &quot;hits&quot; and &quot;CR&quot; are deemed - both are correct memories. Treating them differently may have implications on the d', which is the main memory measure in the paper, and possibly on measures of decision bias that are used as well.</p>
<p>4. The study starts off with a sample size of N=39 but excludes 17 participants for some crucial analyses. This is a high number, and it's not entirely clear from the text whether exclusion criteria were pre-registered or decided upon before looking at the data. Having said that, some criteria seem very reasonable (e.g., excluding participants who were not fully exposed to words during sleep). It would still be helpful to see that the trend remains when including all participants who had sufficient exposure during sleep. Also, please carefully mention for each analysis what the N was.</p>
<p>5. Relatedly, the final N is low for a between-subjects study (N=11 per group). This is adequately mentioned as a limitation, but since it does qualify the results, it seemed important to mention it in the public review.</p>
<p>1. The linguistic statistics used for establishing the artificial words are all based on American English, and are therefore in misalignment with the spoken language of the participants (which was German). The authors should address this limitation and discuss possible differences between the languages. Also, if the authors checked whether participants were fluent in English they should report these results and possibly consider them in their analyses. In all fairness, the behavioural effects presented in Figure 2A are convincing, providing a valuable manipulation test.</p>
<p>2. With regard to the higher probability of nested spindles for the high- vs low-PP cueing conditions, the authors should try and explore whether what the results show is a general increase for spindles altogether (as has been reported in the past to be correlated with TMR benefit and sleep more generally) or a specific increase in nested spindles (with no significant change in the absolute numbers of post-cue spindles). In both cases, the results would be interesting, but differentiating the two is necessary in order to make the claim that nesting is what increased rather than spindle density altogether, regardless of the SW phase.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
The work by Klaassen &amp; Rasch investigates the influence of word learning difficulty on sleep-associated consolidation and reactivation. They elicited reactivation during sleep by applying targeted memory reactivation (TMR) and manipulated word learning difficulty by creating words more similar (easy) or more dissimilar (difficult) to our language. In one group of participants, they applied TMR of easy words and in another group of participants, they applied TMR of difficult words (between-subjects design). They showed that TMR leads to higher memory benefits in the easy compared to the difficult word group. On a neural level, they showed an increase in spindle power (in the up-state of an evoked response) when easy words were presented during sleep.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
The authors investigate a research question relevant to the field, that is, which experiences are actually consolidated during sleep. To address this question, they developed an innovative task and manipulated difficulty in an elegant way.</p>
<p>Overall, the paper is clearly structured, and results and methods are described in an understandable way. The analysis approach is solid.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
1.Sample size</p>
<p>
For a between-subjects design, the sample size is too small (N = 22). The main finding (also found in the title &quot;Difficulty in artificial word learning impacts targeted memory reactivation&quot;) is based on an independent samples t-test with 11 participants/group.</p>
<p>The authors explicitly mention the small sample size and the between-subjects design as a limitation in their discussion. Nevertheless, making meaningful inferences based on studies with such a small sample size is difficult, if not impossible.</p>
<p>2.Choice of task</p>
<p>
Even though the task itself is innovative, there would have been tasks better suited to address the research question. The main disadvantage the task and the operationalisation of memory performance (d') have is that single-trial performance cannot be calculated. Consequently, choosing individual items for TMR is not possible.</p>
<p>Additionally, TMR of low vs. high difficulty is conducted between subjects (and independently of pre-sleep memory performance) which is a consequence of the task design.</p>
<p>The motivation for why this task has been used is missing in the paper.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
In this study, the authors investigated the effects of targeted memory reactivation (TMR) during sleep on memory retention for artificial words with varying levels of phonotactical similarity to real words. The authors report that the high phonotactic probability (PP) words showed a more pronounced EEG alpha decrease during encoding and were more easily learned than the low PP words. Following TMR during sleep, participants who had been cued with the high PP TMR, remembered those words better than 0, whilst no such difference was found in the other conditions. Accordingly, the authors report higher EEG spindle band power during slow-wave up-states for the high PP as compared to low PP TMR trials. Overall, the authors conclude that artificial words that are easier to learn, benefit more from TMR than those which are difficult to learn.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
1. The authors have carefully designed the artificial stimuli to investigate the effectiveness of TMR on words that are easy to learn and difficult to learn due to their levels of similarity with prior word-sound knowledge. Their approach of varying the level of phonotactic probability enables them to have better control over phonotactical familiarity than in a natural language and are thus able to disentangle which properties of word learning contribute to TMR success.</p>
<p>2. The use of EEG during wakeful encoding and sleep TMR sheds new light on the neural correlates of high PP vs. low PP both during wakeful encoding and cue-induced retrieval during sleep.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
1. The present analyses are based on a small sample and comparisons between participants. Considering that the TMR benefits are based on changes in memory categorization between participants, it could be argued that the individuals in the high PP group were more susceptible to TMR than those in the low PP group for reasons other than the phonotactic probabilities of the stimuli (e.g., these individuals might be more attentive to sounds in the environment during sleep). While the authors acknowledge the small sample size and between-subjects comparison as a limitation, a discussion of an alternative interpretation of the data is missing.</p>
<p>2. While the one-tailed comparison between the high PP condition and 0 is significant, the ANOVA comparing the four conditions (between subjects: cued/non-cued, within-subjects: high/low PP) does not show a significant effect. With a non-significant interaction, I would consider it statistically inappropriate to conduct post-hoc tests comparing the conditions against each other. Furthermore, it is unclear whether the p-values reported for the t-tests have been corrected for multiple comparisons. Thus, these findings should be interpreted with caution.</p>
<p>3. With the assumption that the artificial words in the study have different levels of phonotactic similarity to prior word-sound knowledge, it was surprising to find that the phonotactic probabilities were calculated based on an American English lexicon whilst the participants were German speakers. While it may be the case that the between-language lexicons overlap, it would be reassuring to see some evidence of this, as the level of phonotactic probability is a key manipulation in the study.</p>
<p>4. Another manipulation in the study is that participants learn whether the words are linked to a monetary reward or not, however, the rationale for this manipulation is unclear. For instance, it is unclear whether the authors expect the reward to interact with the TMR effects.</p>
