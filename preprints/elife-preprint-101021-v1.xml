<title>Abstract</title><p>Human perception is susceptible to social influences. To determine if and how individuals opportunistically integrate real-time social information about noisy stimuli into their judgment, we tracked perceptual accuracy and confidence in social (dyadic) and non-social (solo) settings using a novel continuous perceptual report (CPR) task with peri-decision wagering. In the dyadic setting, most participants showed a higher degree of perceptual confidence. In contrast, average accuracy did not improve compared to solo performance. Underlying these net effects, partners in the dyad exhibit mutual convergence of accuracy and confidence, benefitting less competent or confident individuals, at the expense of the better performing partner. In conclusion, real-time social information asymmetrically shapes human perceptual decision-making, with dyads expressing more confidence without a matching gain in overall competence.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Natural behavior is a time-continuous process that depends on past events, reward contingencies, expectations, and social context. To behave adaptively in uncertain environments, individuals collect and evaluate dynamic sensory evidence. Perceptual decision-making encompasses two main dimensions: competence (accuracy of the percept) and confidence in the perceptual experience. Perceptual confidence, the individual’s belief regarding the accuracy of the own perception via metacognitive assessment of the perceptual history, plays a key role in perceptual decision-making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Fleming and Lau, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Kepecs and Mainen, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Yeung and Summerfield, 2012</xref>). Social settings can change decision competence and confidence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bahrami et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Bang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Esmaily et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Pescetelli et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Pescetelli and Yeung, 2022</xref>). In a social interaction, the assessment of own and other’s behavior depends on the individuals’ skill level: Incompetent individuals do not only perform poorly but are also unable to recognize this (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Kruger and Dunning, 1999</xref>). However, it remains uncertain whether this metacognitive bias applies to basic perceptual phenomena, specifically the relationship between perceptual accuracy and perceptual confidence. Furthermore, it is not clear how real-time social influence manifests when individual decisions are combined with social signals. To address these gaps, we investigate whether, under which conditions, and to what extent unconstrained social information exchange affects the continuous accuracy and confidence reports of individuals during perception of ambiguous visual stimuli during a decision-making paradigm with unconstrained social exchange.</p>
<p>Perceptual decision-making is susceptible to both informational and normative social influences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Frith and Singer, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Takagaki and Krug, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Terenzi et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Toelch and Dolan, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Van Den Bos et al., 2013</xref>). For instance, by integrating the perceptual report of a partner with one’s own subjective experience, the quality of perceptual judgments can be optimized and result in collective benefits but only under certain conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bahrami et al., 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">2012a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Baumgart et al., 2020</xref>). In addition, social information can speed up decision-making by reducing exploration time, but it can also introduce biases and false beliefs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Bang and Frith, 2017</xref>). For example, social conformity biases information uptake towards majority choices in perceptual decision-making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Germar et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Toelch et al., 2018</xref>). Confidence reports in particular have been shown to have a major influence during social exchange. Judging competence of others is difficult because it requires performance monitoring over time. Therefore, agents often use confidence signals of a partner as surrogate for assessing competence of others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Bang and Frith, 2017</xref>). Furthermore, confidence signals could serve as a channel for social information transfer. For instance, the expressed confidence range can adapt to specific social partners to achieve more optimal group decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Bang et al., 2017</xref>). Access to choices coupled with the confidence of another player has been reported to modulate post-decision wagers: dyadic choice agreement caused increases in confidence levels while disagreement reduced confidence. Furthermore, compared to solo performance, dyadic agreement resulted in greater improvements to both confidence and accuracy than disagreement reduced these factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Pescetelli et al., 2016</xref>). Accuracy and confidence measures generally covary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Baumgart et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Khalvati et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Pescetelli et al., 2016</xref>), however, how real-time social feedback during continuous evidence accumulation affects each measure is poorly understood.</p>
<p>Previous studies of social perceptual decision-making are characterized by the following aspects: First, sensory stimuli were presented in a serial and random manner, however, sensory perception is an ongoing and correlated process. Second, trial-based, discrete paradigms have been used, with delays between perceptual and metacognitive reports. This makes it liable to include aspects in metacognitive judgments that were not available at the time of the perceptual report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Navajas et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Yeung and Summerfield, 2012</xref>). Third, choices were limited to two options, e.g., left vs right (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Esmaily et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Kiani and Shadlen, 2009</xref>) or first vs second interval (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bahrami et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Pescetelli and Yeung, 2022</xref>), not allowing the report of the graded sensory perception. Fourth, social exchange and joint decision-making was imposed, resulting in interdependent dyadic performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bahrami et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Bang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Baumgart et al., 2020</xref>). Furthermore, choices have been recorded in a serial manner with individual choices preceding joint choices. To understand how decision confidence and accuracy evolve during the course of the dynamic decision-making and how both factors are shaped by the availability of social information, novel experimental methods allowing unrestricted access to continuous reports are needed. Indeed, recent work began to demonstrate the influence of continuous confidence reports during dyadic co-action, although still in a two-alternative and serial design. Dynamic, mutually visible confidence reports elicited greater increase of perceptual confidence during agreement and less reduction during disagreement, compared to static reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Pescetelli and Yeung, 2020</xref>), and also resulted in the confidence alignment between dyadic human partners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Pescetelli and Yeung, 2022</xref>).</p>
<p>To overcome these limitations, a new approach that partly reconciles the mismatch between real-life continuous perception and experiments has recently emerged: continuous psychophysics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Bonnen et al., 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Huk et al., 2018</xref>). This technique quantifies various sensorimotor and cognitive processes in real-time via continuous perceptual reports (CPR). CPRs have been shown to be viable alternatives for estimating perceptual uncertainty parameters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Straub and Rothkopf, 2022</xref>). As perceptual reports are displayed continuously, we argue that CPRs are particularly useful to measure interacting processes that unfold over time, such as the integration of noisy sensory and social information. To that end, we developed a novel CPR paradigm that allows the assessment of individual decision-making during social (dyadic) and non-social (solo) decision-making. Notably, our social setting did not enforce dyadic payoff interdependence: the payoffs of the two players did not influence each other. Participants were free to monitor and opportunistically incorporate information provided by the other player, without being compelled to do so by the task design.</p>
<p>Our task was set up to dissociate the perceptual report and the associated confidence via real-time (“peri-decision”) wagering, using standardized, easily comparable visual cues (see Methods). Previous work resorted to <italic>post-decision</italic> confidence assessments like (i) numerical ratings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Boldt and Yeung, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Fleming et al., 2010</xref>), (ii) post-decision wagering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Moreira et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Persaud et al., 2007</xref>), or (iii) opt-out/decline response options (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Gail et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Hanks and Summerfield, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Khalvati et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Kiani and Shadlen, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Komura et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Smith, 1997</xref>). Here, in contrast, we use continuous wagering to allow immediate access to the full perceptual report of others, including accuracy and confidence. With this approach, we aimed to answer the following questions: First, do humans express perceptual confidence in real-time? Second, does accuracy and the expression of confidence depend on the social setting? We hypothesize that humans signal perceptual confidence based on a real-time evaluation of the visual scene, and incorporate others’ perceptual choice and confidence to better interpret ambiguous sensory information. Specifically, we expect the weighted integration of sensory and social evidence to result in more accurate and confident perceptual reports. We conjectured that a partner’s task competence is a key driver of information integration during social interaction, with more dyadic benefit for participants performing worse in the solo condition.</p>

<sec id="s2">
<title>Results</title>
<p>To assess the integration of social information, we developed a behavioral paradigm (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>, <xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 1a</xref> and Supplementary Video 1, Continuous Perceptual Report task, ‘CPR’, see Methods) that enables continuous “peri-decision” wagering on the accuracy of perceptual judgments about the direction of a noisy random dot pattern (RDP). Participants used a joystick to signal their perceived direction (angle) and confidence (eccentricity, the deviation from the central position). Their task was to maximize the monetary reward score by following the direction of the RDP as accurately as possible, so that their cursor (partial circle, ‘response arc’) would overlap with occasionally presented small reward targets appearing in the direction of the coherent motion (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 1b</xref>). Notably, increasing joystick eccentricity shortened the arc length, making it harder to hit the target. In case of a successful target hit, the reward score was calculated as the product of report accuracy and confidence (and was zero otherwise, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1d</xref>). This reward scheme was intended to elicit continuous peri-decision wagering, by awarding large rewards for accurate and confident reports, small rewards for less accurate and/or less confident reports, and omitting rewards for inaccurate but confident reports.</p>

<p>Participants played the game in different experimental settings: alone (<italic>solo)</italic> and together with a partner (<italic>dyadic</italic>). In dyadic experiments, we continuously presented the perceptual (joystick) reports – perceived motion direction and associated confidence – of both participants in a mutually visible manner. In the context of this paper, we define as social information the perceptual report of the partner. In addition, ‘task competence’ refers to perceptual accuracy, while ‘performance’ relates to the behavioral outcome (reward score).</p>

<title>Humans express perceptual confidence in real-time through peri-decision wagering</title>
<p>Confidence measures have been shown to scale with evidence accumulation time and perceptual performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Balsdon et al., 2021</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Kiani and Shadlen, 2009</xref>). Our task design intended to capture perceptual confidence changes via real-time wagering behavior. First, we verified that participants used peri-decision wagering while playing the CPR game. To that end, we quantified if the overall quality of the solo report depended on the RDP motion coherence. The following parameters were considered: joystick position (accuracy &amp; eccentricity), the proportion of successfully collected targets (‘hit rate’, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2a</xref>), and joystick response lag after an RDP direction change (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2b-c</xref>, <xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 1d</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>Participants responded, on average, 643 ms ± 78 ms (Mean ± IQR, coherence pooled) after an RDP direction change, with higher motion coherence causing faster stimulus following responses. Low RDP coherence resulted in a breakdown of motion tracking, increasing the variance of cross-correlation peaks. This motion tracking profile reflects the average evidence integration time, with faster more reliable responses suggesting higher levels of confidence.</p>
<p>Despite high inter-subject variability, we found that motion coherence robustly impacts all behavioral response measures: hit rates, joystick accuracy and joystick eccentricity (Linear mixed effects model – see <xref rid="tblS1" ref-type="table">Supplementary Table 1</xref> to <xref rid="tblS4" ref-type="table">Supplementary Table 4</xref>). This suggests that participants were able to adapt their behavioral response to varying stimulus difficulty to maximize monetary outcome. Hence, participants had utilized the contingencies of the game and were able to wager on their percepts. In addition to this consistent joystick response modulation, we further demonstrate that hit rates, while generally increasing with motion coherence, dropped for 24 of 38 participants (63%) during the most salient RDP coherence, suggesting overconfident or risk-seeking joystick placement. These findings imply faster evidence integration resulting in higher perceptual accuracy and confidence levels.</p>
<p>To assess if subjects used joystick eccentricity as a proxy for perceptual confidence, we adapted the metacognitive performance analysis of the area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC) for confidence ratings to our continuous joystick responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Fleming and Lau, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Maniscalco and Lau, 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">2012</xref>). We used the distributions of joystick response measurements to infer whether there is a relationship between response accuracy and eccentricity, separately for each RDP coherence level. To that end, we median-split the joystick responses into high- and low eccentricity distributions. We then analyzed the AUC to quantify if the accuracy of these distributions were different. High accuracy was indeed related to higher eccentricity, suggesting an ongoing metacognitive assessment of the perceptual report that is reflected in the eccentric joystick placement (<xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 2</xref>). Thus, participants optimized joystick placement in both response dimensions (accuracy and eccentricity) when the task was easier, which provides further evidence for real-time peri-decision wagering, and the link between joystick eccentricity and perceptual confidence.</p>
<p>In summary, the solo CPR data indicate that participants positioned the joystick to actively wager on their own percept. As the eccentric joystick position was the only response dimension that could be chosen freely via metacognitive assessment of the current perceptual process, it can be treated as a proxy measure of subjective perceptual confidence. Usage and range of this response parameter varied widely between participants, suggesting individual confidence ranges. These findings imply that our CPR game makes it possible to continuously assess participants’ perceptual processes and associated confidence based on the behavioral report. In the next section, we examine whether and to what extent participants incorporated the perceptual report of a second player into their own decision-making process and how this affected perceptual accuracy and confidence.</p>

<title>Social setting changes perceptual confidence during real-time decision-making</title>
<p>Previous studies have shown that, under certain conditions, two participants are more successful in perceptual decision-making than the more competent player on its own (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Bahrami et al., 2012b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Pescetelli and Yeung, 2022</xref>). We asked whether participants performed the CPR task better when a second player was playing along, and if so, whether changes in perceptual competence or confidence were the driving forces behind any improvement. To that end, we have developed a two-player (dyadic) CPR task (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1a</xref>) to assess whether and how participants incorporated information from another player into their own perceptual report. Dyadic conditions could be real, with two human participants playing simultaneously (‘HH dyad’; participants were introduced to the other player beforehand); or simulated, with one participant (who is led to believe to be playing with another participant) performing alongside a computer agent (‘HC dyad’). This section covers results of human-human dyadic experiments. Both participants reacted to the same RDP and could observe both cursors and feedback of immediate and cumulative scores for themselves and the other player (see Methods). Importantly, we did not enforce a competitive or cooperative context – the individual payoff did not directly depend on the performance of the partner. Thus, participants could freely choose whether to use or ignore the perceptual report of the other player.</p>
<p>We pooled all experimental sessions of each participant according to social context (solo vs dyadic, within-subject). Average response lags after a direction change were significantly different in solo and dyadic experiments (Solo: 643 ms ± 78 ms [Mean ± IQR]; Dyadic 662 ms ± 105 ms; Wilcoxon signed rank test, n = 34, Z = −2.98, p &lt; 0.01), albeit the average response lag difference was small. We also found a small but significant improvement in average individual score between solo and dyadic experiments (Solo: 0.2357 ± 0.0696 [Mean ± IQR]; Dyadic 0.247 ± 0.049; Wilcoxon signed rank test, n = 34 (subjects), Z = 2.31, p &lt; 0.05). Compared to the solo CPR, 68% of participants (23/34) achieved a higher score when co-acting with a partner (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3a</xref>). On the level of a dyad, the combined score of two players working together was higher than that of the same two players working alone (Mean difference = 0.023, Wilcoxon signed rank test, n = 50 (dyads), Z= −3.36, p&lt;0.001). Thus, social context seemed to improve overall task outcome (‘reward score’).</p>

</fig>
<p>Next, we assessed whether changes in perceptual competence (discrete: hit rate; continuous: accuracy) or confidence were the driving factors behind this improvement. Hit rates were unaffected by social setting (Solo: 0.3887 ± 0.1054 [Mean ± IQR]; Dyadic 0.3909 ± 0.0638; Wilcoxon signed rank test, n = 34 (subjects), Z = 0.6582, p = 0.51). Furthermore, average response accuracy in dyadic experiments did not change for 94% (32/34) of participants (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3b</xref>; within subjects: Wilcoxon rank-sum test, coherence pooled, number of tests: 34 (subjects), Bonferroni-corrected significance threshold = 0.0015; across subjects: Wilcoxon signed rank test, Median AUC = 0.49, Z = −1.94, p = 0.0523). Thus, the access to reports of others did not improve average CPR competence. However, 94% of participants (32/34) placed their joysticks at a significantly different eccentric position when playing in a dyadic setting (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3b</xref>; within subjects: Wilcoxon rank-sum test, coherence pooled, number of tests: 34 (subjects), Bonferroni-corrected significance threshold = 0.0015; across subjects: Wilcoxon signed rank test, Median AUC = 0.57, Z = 2.47, p &lt; 0.05), suggesting altered confidence reports in a social setting. We estimated the directionality of the dyadic vs solo <italic>social modulation</italic> with the area under the receiver-operating characteristic (AUC) for each player (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3c</xref> + <xref rid="figS3" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 3</xref>, see Methods). Of all participants with significantly different joystick eccentricity in solo and dyadic conditions, 38% - 56% (min and max across coherence levels) increased their joystick eccentricity when playing with a partner, while 12% - 26% changed to a more central position, i.e., played more conservative (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3c</xref>, Wilcoxon rank-sum test, number of tests: 34 (subjects) * 7 (coherence levels) = 238, Bonferroni-corrected significance threshold = 2.1008e-04). Thus, most participants achieved better score by signaling, on average, more perceptual confidence during their continuous perceptual report in a social setting. The observed bidirectional effect might be explained by dyadic convergence, as initially less confident participants seemed to increase their perceptual wagers, while accurate individuals declined in accuracy (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3c</xref>, plot of social modulation vs solo performance, see also <xref rid="figS4" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 4</xref>) We further explore this hypothesis in the next section.</p>

<sec id="s2c">
<title>Performance difference between participants determines dyadic effect</title>
<p>When comparing all solo vs all dyadic sessions, our results suggest that perceptual confidence but not competence is modulated by the social setting. We next asked whether the observed social modulation can be explained by within-dyad differences in solo behavior. Intuitively, we hypothesized that a larger difference in solo performance between subjects would lead to a stronger modulation by the social context, because no additional information can be derived from observing a very similar partner (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4a</xref>, ‘bow-tie’). On the other hand, earlier work suggested less successful perceptual decision-making in dyadic settings when perceptual sensitivities or confidence differ strongly between participants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bahrami et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Pescetelli and Yeung, 2022</xref>). To test these rival hypotheses, we analyzed the social modulation by contrasting the dyadic vs solo AUC for each player (all solo sessions of this subject vs specific dyadic session, RDP coherence pooled). Overall, we observed three behavioral patterns, across the range of individual solo differences (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4a</xref>): (i) both participants improved in a social setting (AUC &gt; 0.5; Accuracy: 14% of dyads, Eccentricity: 48% of dyads), (ii) both participants got worse (AUC &lt; 0.5; Accuracy: 38%, Eccentricity: 16%) and (iii) one player improved while the other got worse (Accuracy: 48%, Eccentricity: 36%). Across the participants, the confidence increased while accuracy slightly decreased in the dyadic setting (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4a</xref> – histogram, Wilcoxon signed rank test (n = 100), Accuracy: Median = 0.48, Z = - 2.93, p &lt; 0.01; Eccentricity: Median = 0.58, Z = 2.92, p &lt; 0.01), confirming earlier within-subject findings for confidence (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). The significant shift of the median from 0.5 indicates asymmetric social modulation. Crucially, in contrast to earlier studies, our data does not reveal systematic dyadic benefits for dyads with similar perceptual accuracy or confidence. Instead, there was a positive (but not significant) correlation between the average social modulation within a dyad and solo difference between players (<xref rid="figS5" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 5a</xref>).</p>

<p>Left column: schematic depiction of hypothesized effects; middle and right column: actual data for eccentricity (confidence) and accuracy. <bold>(a)</bold> Left: social modulation might increase monotonically with solo performance difference (‘bow-tie’). Alternatively, similar performance has been shown to result in dyadic improvements (‘Gaussian’). Middle and right: within-dyad social modulation (dyadic vs solo), measured by AUC, as a function of the within-dyad solo difference.

<graphic xlink:href="608609v1_fig4.tif" mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image"/>
</fig>
<p>To further examine the relationship between solo and dyadic performance, we tested the social modulation difference between the two players in the dyad, again as a function of individual differences in the solo condition. The absolute social modulation difference increased with larger difference in solo performance, as indicated by the running averages and better fits resembling a U-shaped function instead of a linear function (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4b</xref>, Adj. R<sup>2</sup>: Accuracy: Linear = 0.0335 vs. Quadratic = 0.0620; Eccentricity: Linear = −0.0186 vs. Quadratic = 0.2271). Thus, more dissimilar solo performance elicits large differences in social modulation.</p>
<p>Furthermore, concerning the direction of this relationship, we hypothesized that the worse solo player would benefit from a social setting, <italic>relative</italic> to the better solo player (here and elsewhere, “worse”/“better” mean less/more confident/accurate, correspondingly). <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4c</xref> (right column, see also <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4a</xref>) illustrates two possible scenarios: for dyad x, the individually worse player benefits from social context while the better solo player gets worse. For dyad y, both players get better, but the individually worse one improves more. We correlated the <italic>signed</italic> social modulation difference between the two members of each dyad with the difference in solo behavior. For both eccentricity and accuracy, a negative correlation was found between the within-dyad difference in social modulation and the difference in solo task (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4c</xref>, Pearson correlation, n = 50, Eccentricity: r = −0.74, p &lt; 0.05; Accuracy: r = −0.6, p &lt; 0.01; compared to permuted dyads, see Methods). Thus, in line with our prediction, worse solo players either improve more or at least get less bad, relative to the initially better partner (who is either improving less or getting worse).</p>
<p>The observed effects could be explained by confidence convergence during dyadic interaction, which has been reported to impact perceptual accuracy of individual and dyadic decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Bang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Pescetelli and Yeung, 2022</xref>). To directly test this, we contrasted the absolute eccentricity and accuracy differences between the two players in dyadic vs solo setting. Compared to solo experiments, 74% of dyads (37/50) exhibit a smaller eccentricity difference when playing together (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4d</xref>, Wilcoxon signed rank test, n = 50, Z = 3.46, p &lt; 0.001). This finding and the relative benefit for the worse solo player (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4c</xref>) suggest dyadic convergence for metacognitive confidence, and to a smaller extent for accuracy, in a social context. This convergence is asymmetric because initially more confident players were affected less, and more accurate players were affected more, than their counterparts (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3c</xref>), resulting in overall positive shift for confidence and slight negative shift for accuracy (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4a</xref>).</p>
<p>Lastly, we compared the average eccentricity and the average accuracy correlations between the two players, in solo and dyadic context. As expected, there was no correlation between solo reports, but the participants’ behavior became significantly correlated when they played together (<xref rid="figS5" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 5c</xref>, Pearson’s correlation, n = 50, Accuracy: Solo: r = 0.19, p = 0.18, Dyadic: r = 0.48, p &lt; 0.001; Eccentricity: Solo: r = 0.11, p = 0.44, Dyadic: r = 0.54, p &lt; 0.001).</p>

<title>Perceptual accuracy improves with reliable social signaling</title>
<p>As expected, the quality of the solo perceptual report declined in a comparable fashion across participants for low stimulus coherence (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). We wondered if this perceptual breakdown led to the relatively small accuracy modulation by the social context we described above (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>). Based on earlier work on Bayesian integration and social conformity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">De Martino et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Germar et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Khalvati et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Park et al., 2017</xref>), we expected that integrating information from a partner will be weighted by their reports’ accuracy reliability. We hypothesized that participants would integrate more social evidence when it was reliably accurate, regardless of the stimulus noise. Furthermore, we asked whether incorporating social signals into human decision-making requires graded, accuracy-depended confidence signaling by others.</p>
<p>To that end, we developed a computer player, that was programed to accurately represent the nominal RDP direction (± Gaussian noise; note that even 0% coherence had a correct “nominal” direction), with a fixed “confidence” of 0.5 (± Gaussian noise in a.u.) across all coherence levels at all times (<xref rid="figS6" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 6</xref>). In such human-computer (HC) dyads, the computer player was physically impersonated by one of the experimenters who pretended to be the partner. Thus, participants believed that they played the game with another human. The computer player was set up to report motion direction with a constant, human-like latency (508 ms ± Gaussian noise). The computer response was not affected by the cursor of the human participants, resulting in a situation where the social signals might only unilaterally affect the human player. Crucially, unlike real human partners, the computer player did not provide useful information regarding its tracking confidence. With this condition we aimed to evaluate whether human participants would integrate social cues about the motion direction into their own reports, while the partner’s confidence report was uninformative. We nevertheless expected a response accuracy improvement, especially when sensory evidence became degraded at low coherences. Furthermore, we hypothesized that the reliable nature of the computer partner would result in riskier, more eccentric joystick placement in human players.</p>
<p>By accurately representing the stimulus direction, the computer player triggered profound behavioral effects (<xref rid="tblS2" ref-type="table">Supplementary Table 2</xref> to <xref rid="tblS4" ref-type="table">Supplementary Table 4</xref>). In this setting, participants collected more targets with a higher score (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5a</xref>). Compared to human-human dyads, 48% of participants (16/33) improved their accuracy (while none became worse) across all coherence levels (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5b-d</xref>, within-subjects: Wilcoxon rank-sum test, coherence pooled, number of tests = 33 (subjects), Bonferroni-corrected significance threshold = 0.0015; across subjects: Wilcoxon signed rank test, Median AUC = 0.57, Z = 4.85, p &lt; 0.001; see <xref rid="figS7" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 7</xref> for comparison to solo behavior). In particular, 52% of participants (17/33) showed a significant accuracy boost at 0% coherence (Wilcoxon rank-sum test, number of tests: 33 (subjects) * 7 (coherence levels) = 231, Bonferroni-corrected significance threshold = 2.1645e-04, Median AUC across subjects at 0% coherence = 0.73). Thus, participants integrated reliable sensory-social direction cues to improve their task performance, especially when stimulus was ambiguous, suggesting a unilateral convergence towards the computer player. But despite more accurate task performance, most participants did not improve in the eccentricity dimension (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5b-d</xref>). In fact, compared to an interaction with a real human counterpart, 64% of participants showed less confidence while only 18% improved when playing with the computer player (within-subjects: Wilcoxon rank-sum test, coherence pooled, number of tests = 33 (subjects), Bonferroni-corrected significance threshold = 0.0015, across subjects: Wilcoxon signed rank test, Median AUC = 0.45, Z = −3.15, p &lt; 0.01). Subjects were particularly affected when the task was easy (98% coherence, Median AUC across subjects = 0.36). This too seems to suggest confidence convergence to the relatively invariant low confidence computer player, even with otherwise reliably accurate direction signaling.</p>

<title>Social modulation of confidence and accuracy co-varies across dyads</title>
<p>So far, we analyzed the accuracy and the eccentricity modulations independently. Here we investigate the link between the two report dimensions.

However, the apparent dissociation between the <italic>average</italic> improvement of accuracy and the <italic>average</italic> decline of confidence is still grounded in a lawful relationship between two response dimensions. Players who gained substantially more accuracy tended to show confidence increase, or at least less confidence decrease, compared to players who did not change much in accuracy (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>, HC vs HH: n = 98, r = 0.62, p &lt; 0.001).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we assessed continuous human perceptual decision-making in social and non-social settings, with a newly developed paradigm, where subjects wager on the correctness of their motion percept in real-time. Overall, in dyadic settings, we find higher perceptual confidence but no gain in accuracy. We demonstrate that convergence during dyadic co-action underlies this net effect: the magnitude and directionality of the behavioral change depends on competence and confidence of the social partners.</p>
<p>In contrast to the general increase in confidence we have observed, previous studies did not report overall rise in confidence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Bang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Pescetelli et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Pescetelli and Yeung, 2022</xref>). However, some earlier work demonstrated gains in dyadic competence – i.e. when the joint decision-making outperforms even the better of two partners – after partners exchanged their individual confidence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bahrami et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Pescetelli et al., 2016</xref>). Likewise, competence increases even during dyadic co-action, especially for participants with similar confidence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Pescetelli and Yeung, 2022</xref>). Despite presenting subjective confidence continuously and saliently as part of the perceptual report, our dyadic task did not evoke overall improvements in accuracy (a continuous measure of competence) or hit rate (a discrete measure of competence), suggesting a metacognitive bias in social conditions. The resulting score (which combines accuracy, hit rate, and confidence), however, did improve in the dyadic setting, suggesting a form of dyadic benefit dissociated from perceptual competence. This indicates that real-time social feedback boosts confidence in one’s perception, without a corresponding enhancement in competence.</p>
<p>This apparent disconnect between confidence (which can be construed as perceived competence) and actual competence is further reflected in the differences in social modulation as a function of solo performance. We found that individually least confident players exhibited the largest increase in confidence in dyadic settings. Conversely, the most individually accurate players declined in accuracy. Reminiscent of previous work on metacognitive biases in individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Kruger and Dunning, 1999</xref>), we show disproportional effects of social context on perceptual confidence in less competent players. Less skilled individuals benefit from the social information of their superior partners, while proficient individuals give little weight to the information of their less skilled partners.</p>
<p>Along these lines, we found convergence in accuracy and especially confidence between dyadic partners. Direction and magnitude of this effect were determined by the difference in performance of the two players, with the worse solo player changing more and in a more beneficial way during dyadic experiments. Larger solo differences between participants resulted in larger difference in social modulation between the partners. Dyadic confidence convergence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Esmaily et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Pescetelli and Yeung, 2022</xref>) and confidence matching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Bang et al., 2017</xref>) have been described before. Here, we also show systematic social modulation based on not only accuracy and confidence differences between participants but also on their initial solo performance. However, unlike the previous work, where similar confidence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Pescetelli and Yeung, 2022</xref>) or perceptual sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bahrami et al., 2012a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Baumgart et al., 2020</xref>) correlated with higher dyadic competence, we do not find systematic dyadic competence benefits (in our case, average accuracy within a dyad) for subjects with similar task competence or confidence. We speculate that the type and modality of social feedback and interaction might underlie these differences. Explicit verbal communication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bahrami et al., 2012a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">2010</xref>) or periods of metacognitive introspection in which prior individual decisions are evaluated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Pescetelli and Yeung, 2022</xref>) might have elicited competence improvements.</p>
<p>The control experiment with a reliably accurate, simulated dyadic partner who exhibited constant intermediate level of confidence irrespective of the task difficulty evoked vastly improved hit rate and accuracy, especially when sensory information was ambiguous. At the same time, human confidence reports became more conservative when playing with the “conservative” simulated partner, especially at the high stimulus coherence. Improvements in competence together with declining confidence further support dyadic convergence, because the human player gravitated towards the report of the simulated partner. Thus, instead of using the reliably accurate information provided by the computer player to be more accurate <italic>and</italic> more confident, convergence interfered with fully maximizing the reward score. High-accuracy, low-confidence simulated partners have been recently shown to elicit more conservative confidence reports during binary dyadic decision-making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Esmaily et al., 2023</xref>). Beyond these results, our experiments demonstrate that humans do not require sensible confidence expression to recognize and utilize differences in task competence. Our findings indicate a possible dissociation between the direction of accuracy and confidence alignment. At the same time, we observe a positive covariation of accuracy and confidence modulation by the dyadic context, suggesting a retention of metacognitive sensitivity under social influence. We conclude that performance history and temporal reliability might be important factors in addition to explicitly signaled confidence, especially when these information streams are not congruent.</p>
<p>Systematic changes towards group consensus (‘social conformity’) have been shown to bias decision-making towards majority choices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">De Martino et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Germar et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Park et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Toelch and Dolan, 2015</xref>). The dyadic convergence we and others observe might be the basis for social conformity in larger group settings. Critically, dyadic convergence bilaterally affects both partners, but asymmetrically. For instance, the more confident players adjust their confidence very little but such individuals may disproportionally influence group consensus.</p>
<p>In our experiment, participants were not instructed to cooperate or compete with one another. They did not jointly reach a perceptual decision but instead co-acted under independent reward contingencies. This difference to previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Bahrami et al., 2012b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">2012a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Pescetelli et al., 2016</xref>) is crucial for interpreting our results, since participants could ignore the overt behavior of the other player. Therefore, any social modulation or correlated behavior observed in our experiment can be attributed to a spontaneous, self-regulated process. We interpret our findings as evidence that in social situations most people spontaneously and opportunistically integrate the judgment of others into their own decisions, even when social interaction is not incentivized or enforced. In line with this argument, humans seem to naturally follow gaze signals and choice preferences of others, suggesting the utilization of others’ thoughts and intentions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Bayliss et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Madipakkam et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Mitsuda and Masaki, 2018</xref>). Furthermore, human co-action seems to result in attentional attraction or withdrawal in some dyads (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Dosso et al., 2018</xref>). As next step, it would be very interesting to test whether face-to-face co-action through the transparent shared visual display will induce even stronger social effects compared to separate experimental booths (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Moeller et al., 2023</xref>).</p>
<p>The advent of new techniques such as time-continuous decision-making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Bonnen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Huk et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Noel et al., 2023</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">2022</xref>) and hyperscanning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Babiloni and Astolfi, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Czeszumski et al., 2020</xref>) allow to ask how evolving decisional variables are represented in neural circuitry underlying flexible behaviors. This is an important step beyond the traditional approach based on discrete, trial-based decisions. Adapting this approach, we demonstrate real-time influence of social information on human perceptual decisions. Studies investigating the neuronal correlates of similar perceptual decisions have demonstrated faster and more accurate behavioral responses when the sensory evidence resulted in earlier and more reliable neuronal changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Fan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Gold and Stocker, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Kiani and Shadlen, 2009</xref>). It has also been shown that microstimulation- and optogenetically- elicited inputs can be integrated into perceptual decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Fetsch et al., 2018</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Salzman et al., 1990</xref>). Along these lines, we propose that reliably accurate real-time social information is multiplexed with sensory signals, possibly resulting in enhanced encoding already in cortical neurons representing relevant sensory dimensions.</p>
<p>In summary, we show that the presence of a co-acting social partner adaptively changes continuous perceptual decisions, resulting in mutual but asymmetric convergence and a net dyadic benefit. This is particularly apparent in a strong improvement of competence, confidence, and reward score of the worse partner. The better partner, on the other hand, gets less accurate and/or slightly loses confidence. These lawful relationships between confidence and competence modulations demonstrate the importance of concurrently considering these two measures, both within each participant and across interacting partners. These results advance our understanding of how humans evaluate and incorporate social information, especially in real-time decision-making situations not permitting slow and careful deliberation.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="s4a">
<title>Study design and participants</title>
<p>Data were recorded from 38 human participants (Median age: 26.17 years, IQR 4.01; 13 of which with corrected vision) between January 2022 and August 2023. Prior to the experimental sessions, each participant was trained on two occasions. During the experimental phase, participants played three variations of the experimental paradigm: alone (solo), with a human player (Human-Human dyad), and with a computer player (Human-Computer dyad). The experimental order was mixed and largely determined by the availability of participants (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 1a</xref>). Most participants in this study originated from central Europe or South Asia. All procedures performed in this study were approved by the Ethics Board of the University of Göttingen (Application 171/292).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4b">
<title>Experimental setup</title>
<p>Participants sat in separate experimental booths with identical hardware. They were instructed to rest their head on a chinrest, placed 57 cm away from the screen (Asus XG27AQ, 27” LCD). A single-stick joystick (adapted analog multifunctional joystick (Sasse), Resolution: 10-bit, 100 Hz) was anchored to an adjustable platform placed in front of the participants, at a height of 75 cm from the floor. The joystick was calibrated before data acquisition to ensure comparable readouts. Screens were calibrated to be isoluminant. Two speakers (Behringer MS16), one for each setup were used to deliver auditory feedback at 70 dB SPL.</p>
<p>The experimental paradigm was programmed in MWorks (Version 0.10 - <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://mworks.github.io">https://mworks.github.io</ext-link>). Two iMac Pro computers (Apple, MacOS Mojave 10.14.6) served as independent servers for each setup booth. These computers were controlled by an iMac Pro (Apple, MacOS Mojave 10.14.6). Custom-made plugins for MWorks were used to generate and display the stimuli, to handle the data acquisition from the joystick (10 ms sampling rate), and to incorporate all data from both servers into a single data file.</p>

<sec id="s4c">
<title>Continuous perceptual report (CPR) game</title>
<p>Participants were instructed to maximize monetary outcome in a motion tracking game. In this game, subjects watched a frequently changing random dot pattern on the screen and used a joystick (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Szul et al., 2020</xref>) to indicate their current motion direction perception. The joystick controlled an arc-shaped response cursor on the screen (partial circle with fixed eccentricity, Solo: 2 degree of visual angle (‘dva’) radius from the center of the screen; Dyadic: 1.8 dva &amp; 2 dva radius). The angular direction of the joystick was linked to the cursor’s polar center position. In addition, the joystick eccentricity was permanently coupled to the cursor’s width (see below, 13 – 180 degrees). This resulted a continuous representation of the joystick position along its two axes. By moving the joystick, participants could rotate and shape the cursor. At unpredictable times (1% probability every 10 ms), a small white disc (‘reward target’, diameter: 0.5 dva) appeared on the screen for a duration of 50 ms at 2.5 dva eccentricity, congruently with the motion direction of the stimulus. Whenever a target appeared in line with the cursor, the target was considered collected (‘hit’) and the score of the participant increased. To help participants performing such alignment to the best of their perceptual abilities, a small triangular reference point was added to the center point of the cursor. Throughout the experiment, participants were required to maintain gaze fixation on a central fixation cross (2.5 dva radius tolerance window) or the cursor would disappear and no targets could be collected until fixation was resumed.</p>
<p>In the solo experiments, the cursor was always red. In dyadic conditions, the two cursors, present on screen simultaneously, were red and green (isoluminant at 17.5 cd/m<sup>2</sup> ± 1 cd/m<sup>2</sup>). During dyadic experiments, the position of the two cursors switched between stimulus cycles, with the red cursor always starting above, but not overlapping the green cursor. Each cursor color was permanently associated with one of the two experimental booths. After the mid-session break, participants switched booths, contributing an equal amount of data for each setup (600 reward targets, ∼20 min, up to 17 stimulus cycles). Players initiated new stimulus cycles with a joystick movement. Each stimulus cycle could last up to 75 seconds, during which the RDP’s motion direction and coherence changed at pseudorandomized intervals, resulting in the presentation of 30 stimulus states per cycle.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4d">
<title>Random dot pattern (RDP)</title>
<p>We used a circular RDP (8 dva radius) with white dots on a black background. Each dot had a diameter of 0.1 dva, moved with 8 dva/s and had a lifetime of 25 frames (208 ms). The overall dot density was 2.5 dots/dva. The stimulus patch was centrally located on the screen. The central part of the stimulus (5 dva diameter) was blacked out. In this area we presented the fixation cross and the response arc. The RDP motion direction was randomly seeded and set to change instantly by either 15 deg, 45 deg, 90 deg or 135 deg after a pseudo-randomized time interval of 1250 ms to 2500 ms. Whether the signal moved in clockwise or counterclockwise direction was random. Only signal dots altered their direction. The dot coherence changed pseudo-randomly after 10 RDP direction changes to the coherence level that was presented least. Seven coherence conditions were tested: 0, 8, 13, 22, 36, 59, 98%.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4e">
<title>Gaze control</title>
<p>Participants were required to maintain gaze fixation at the center of the screen throughout each stimulus cycle. We used a white cross (0.3 dva diameter) as anchor point for the participants’ gaze. The diameter of the fixation window was set to 5 dva. An eye tracker (SR research, EyeLink 1000 Plus) was used to control gaze position in real-time. If the gaze position left the fixation window for more than 300 ms, the player’s arc would disappear from the screen, preventing target collection. In addition to this, an increase of the fixation cross’ size, together with a change in color (white to red), signaled to the participants that fixation was broken. As soon as the gaze entered the fixation window again, visual parameters were reset to the original values and the arc would reappear, allowing the player to continue target collection.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4f">
<title>Reward score</title>
<p>Participants were incentivized to maximize their monetary outcome by collecting as many targets as possible with the highest possible score. The minimum polar distance between the arc’s center position and the target’s center (‘accuracy’) as well as the angular width of the arc (‘eccentricity’) at the moment of collection were taken into account when calculating the score:
<disp-formula id="eqn1">
<graphic xlink:href="608609v1_eqn1.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula>
where <italic>RDP<sub>dir</sub></italic>refers to the direction of the random dot pattern and <italic>JS<sub>dir</sub></italic> refers to the direction of the joystick at sample <italic>i</italic>.
<disp-formula id="eqn2">
<graphic xlink:href="608609v1_eqn2.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>

where <italic>Eccentricity</italic> varies between 0 and 1 for minimal and maximal eccentric joystick positions, respectively.
<disp-formula id="eqn3">
<graphic xlink:href="608609v1_eqn3.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula>
Thus, narrower and more accurately placed cursors caused higher reward scores.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4g">
<title>Feedback signals</title>
<p>Various feedback signals were provided throughout the experiment to inform participants about their short- and long-term performance. All feedback signals were mutually visible.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4h">
<title>Immediate feedback</title>
<p>Immediately after a target was collected, visual and acoustic signals were provided simultaneously. The auditory feedback consisted of a 200 ms long sinusoidal pure tone at a frequency determined by the score. Each tone corresponded to a reward range of 12.5%, with lower pitch corresponding to low reward score. We used 8 notes from the C5 major scale (523, 587, 659, 698, 784, 880, 988, 1047 Hz). Sounds were on- and off-ramped using a 50 ms Hanning window. No sound feedback was given for missed targets. In solo experiments, the visual feedback consisted of a 2 dva wide circle, filled in proportion to the score with the same color as the arc’s player. The circle was presented in the center of the screen, behind the fixation cross for 150 ms. In dyadic conditions, the visual feedback consisted of half a disc for each player and both color-coded halves were mutually visible.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4i">
<title>Short-term feedback</title>
<p>During each stimulus cycle, a running average of the reward score was displayed for each player with a 0.9 dva wide, color-coded ring around the circumference of the RDP (18.2 dva and 19.4 dva diameter). After every target presentation, the filled portion of the ring updated. To avoid spatial biasing, the polar zero position of the ring changed randomly with every stimulus cycle.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4j">
<title>Long-term feedback</title>
<p>Cumulative visual feedback was provided after each stimulus cycle (during the inter-cycle intervals) for 2000 ms. It displayed the total reward score accumulated across all cycles as a colored bar graph located at the center of the screen. A grey bar (2 dva wide, max height: 10 dva) indicated the maximal possible cumulative score after each cycle. A colored bar next to it (same dimensions) showed how much was collected by the player so far. In dyadic experiments, red and green bars would be shown on either side of the grey bar. In solo experiments, a red arc was shown to the left of the grey bar. The configuration of the visual stimuli and task parameters is illustrated in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref> and as a supplementary video file (Supplementary Video 1).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4k">
<title>Behavioral analysis</title>
<p>Performance metrics were extracted and averaged in time windows of 30 frames (∼250 ms) that were either target- or state-aligned: Target-alignment refers to time windows prior to the first target presentation of each stimulus state. Target-aligned data were only considered if the first target appeared at least 1000 ms after the direction change. This analysis approach was chosen to (i) allow adequate time for a response and (ii) to avoid the prediction of motion direction based on earlier target locations. State-alignment refer to a 30 frames time-window before a motion direction change of the stimulus. Stimulus states in which fixation breaks exceeded 10% of the state duration were excluded from the performance analyses.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4l">
<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>For population analyses, data were first averaged within-subject. Bootstrapped 95% confidence intervals were estimated with 1000 repetitions (Matlab: bootci). Differences between experimental conditions were tested with a two-sided Wilcoxon signed rank test (Matlab: signrank, for paired samples) and a two-sided paired Wilcoxon rank sum test (Matlab: ranksum). Bonferroni correction was applied for multiple testing. Whether or not coherence was pooled is indicated for each test. Within-subject effect size was estimated with the area under the receiver operating characteristic (‘AUC’, Matlab: perfcurve). AUC values of 0.5 indicated similar distributions. AUC of 0 and 1 suggested perfectly separated distributions. Directionality of social modulation was inferred by AUC change (larger vs smaller than 0.5). Correlation coefficients were calculated with a Pearson correlation (Matlab: corrcoef). Average response lags between stimulus and response were estimated with the maximum cross-correlation coefficient (Matlab: xcorr). Social modulation differences between dyadic players were compared to the baseline modulation of shuffled dyadic partners (Matlab: randperm). We fitted three Generalized Linear Mixed Models (GLMM; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Baayen, 2008</xref>) which differed in their response variable and the size of the data set analyzed but had identical fixed effects structures and largely identical random effects structures. We fitted one model for the probability of a target hit (model 1a), joystick eccentricity (model 1b), and joystick accuracy (model 1c) as the response. All three aimed at estimating the extent to which the respective response variable was affected by the fixed effects of experimental condition (solo or human-computer dyad), random dot pattern coherence, stimulus duration, stimulus number, block number, and day number. We hypothesized that the effect of coherence depended on the condition, thus, we included the interaction between these two predictors into the fixed affects part of the model. To avoid pseudo-replication and account for the possibility that the response was influenced by several layers of non-independence, we included three random intercepts effects, namely those of the ID of the participant, the ID of test day (nested in participant; thereafter ‘day ID’), and the ID of the block (nested in participant and day; thereafter ‘block ID’). The reason for including the latter two was that it could be reasonably assumed that the performance of participants varied between test days and also between blocks tested on the same day. To avoid an ‘overconfident model’ and keep type I error rate at the nominal level of 0.05 we included all theoretically random slopes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Barr et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Schielzeth and Forstmeier, 2009</xref>). These were those of condition, coherence, their interaction, stimulus duration, stimulus number, block number, and day number within participant, coherence, stimulus duration, stimulus number, and block number within day ID, and finally coherence, stimulus duration, and stimulus number within block ID. Originally we also included estimates of the correlations among random intercepts and slopes into each model, but do to convergence and identifiability problems (recognizable by absolute correlation parameters being close to 1; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Matuschek et al., 2017</xref>) we had to exclude all or several of these estimates from the full models (see <xref rid="tblS1" ref-type="table">Supplementary Table 1</xref> for detailed information).</p>
<p>For each model we conducted a full-null model comparison which aims at avoiding ‘cryptic multiple testing’ and keeping the type one error rate at the nominal level of 0.05 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Forstmeier and Schielzeth, 2011</xref>). As we had a genuine interest in all predictors present in the fixed effects part of each model the null models comprised only the intercept in the fixed effect’s part but were otherwise identical to the respective full model. This full-null model comparison utilized a likelihood ratio test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Dobson, 2001</xref>). Tests of individual effects were also based on likelihood ratio test, comparing a full model with an each in a set of reduced models which lacked fixed effects one at a time.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4m">
<title>Model implementation</title>
<p>We fitted all models in R (version 4.3.2; R Core Team, 2023). In model 1a we included the response as a two columns matrix with the number of targets hit and not hit in the first and second column respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Baayen, 2008</xref>). The model was fitted with a binomial error structure and logit link function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">McCullagh and Nelder, 1989</xref>). In essence, such models model the proportion of targets hit. We are aware that in principle one would need an ‘observation level random effect’ which would link the number of targets hit and not hit in a given stage. However, in a relatively large proportion of stages (19.7%) there was only a single target that appeared and in the majority of stages (47.0%) only two targets appeared, making it unlikely that a respective random effect can be fitted successfully.</p>
<p>For models 1b and 1c, we fitted with a beta error distribution and logit link function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Bolker, 2008</xref>). Models fitted with a beta 1 error distribution cannot cope with values in the response being exactly 0 or 1. Hence, when such values were present in a given response variable we transformed then as suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Smithson &amp; Verkuilen, 2006</xref>. Model 1a was fitted using the function glmer of the package lme4 (version 1.134; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Bates et al., 2015</xref>), and models 1b and 1c were fitted using the function glmmTMB of the equally named package (version 1.1.8; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Brooks et al., 2017</xref>). We determined model stability by dropping levels of the random effects factors, one at a time, fitting the full model to each of the subsets, and finally comparing the range of fixed effects estimates obtained from the subsets with those obtained from the model fitted on the respective full data set. This revealed all models to be of good stability. We estimated 95% confidence limits of model estimates and fitted values by means of parametric bootstraps (N=1000 bootstraps; function bootMer of the package lme4 for model 1 and function simulate of package glmmTMB for models the response was overdispersed (maximum dispersion parameter: 1.0).</p>

Note that each experimental session comprised two blocks, one in each setup. Independent of the session type (see panel (a) for more details), scores increased over time, likely due to perceptual learning. The final cumulative score is comprised of the hit rate, accuracy and eccentricity, all of which are affected by number of the experimental block, with later sessions resulting in higher hit rate as well as more accurate and eccentric responses (<xref rid="tblS1" ref-type="table">Supplementary Table 1</xref> - <xref rid="tblS4" ref-type="table">Supplementary Table 4</xref>). <bold>(d)</bold> Normalized cross-correlation coefficients between random dot motion direction and joystick response direction illustrated for each subject.

<p><bold>(a)</bold> Performance summary in (human-human) dyadic experiments. Hit rate (left), accuracy (center) and eccentricity (right) illustrated for each subject contributing human-human dyadic data. Same conventions as in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2a</xref>. <bold>(b)</bold> Comparison of social modulation with response measures of solo experiments. Hit rate differences (left, compared to solo hit rate) and social modulation of accuracy (center, compared to solo accuracy) and eccentricity (right, compared to solo eccentricity) are displayed for the entire population. Joystick data was recorded in a normalized fashion for both accuracy (180deg difference = 0; Perfect match of stimulus direction = 1) and eccentricity (center = 0; Max. eccentricity = 1). Each participant contributes on data point per coherence condition (color-coded). The median score across all subjects is overlaid for each coherence condition in brighter color hues. Error bars show 99% confidence intervals of the median in solo and dyadic conditions. <bold>(c)</bold> Social modulation of the eccentricity responses for three example participants. Data for solo (light, left) and human-human dyadic experiments (dark, right) are displayed for each stimulus coherence level (color-coded). Each dot corresponds to the time-window average for a single stimulus state. All sessions of the same experimental condition are pooled. Corresponding AUC values, used to quantify the direction and magnitude of social modulation between dyadic and solo experiments, are shown below. A value of 0.5 corresponds to perfect overlap between solo and dyadic response distributions, 1 and 0 imply perfect separation between experimental conditions.</p></caption>

The social element is that participants can see another player's responses as well as their own. The study is a <bold>useful</bold> contribution to social decision-making primarily by introducing a new task and offering <bold>solid</bold> evidence on how participants are impacted by others' decisions during continuous perceptual choices. The manuscript could be improved through streamlining, more consistent use of terms such as &quot;dyadic&quot; and clarification about the differences between primary uncertainty and metacognitive confidence.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This paper reports an interesting and clever task that allows the joint measurement of both perceptual judgments and confidence (or subjective motion strength) in real/continuous time. The task is used together with a social condition to identify the (incidental, task-irrelevant) impact of another player on decision-making and confidence.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The innovation on the task alone is likely to be impactful for the field, extending recent continuous report (CPR) tasks to examine other aspects of perceptual decision-making and allowing more naturalistic readouts. One interesting and novel finding is the observation of dyadic convergence of confidence estimates even when the partner is incidental to the task performance, and that dyads tend to be more risk-seeking (indicating greater confidence) than when playing solo. The paper is well-written and clear.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) One concern with the novel task is whether confidence is disambiguated from a tracking of stimulus strength or coherence. The subjects' task is to track motion direction and use the eccentricity of the joystick to control the arc of a catcher - thus implementing a real-time sensitivity to risk (peri-decision wagering). The variable-width catcher has been used to good effect in other confidence/uncertainty tasks involving learning the spread of targets (the Nassar papers). But in the context of an RDK task, one simple strategy here is to map eccentricity directly to (subjective) motion coherence - such that the joystick position at any moment in time is a vector with motion direction and strength. This would still be an interesting task - but could be solved without invoking metacognition or the need to estimate confidence in one's motion direction decision (the analyses in Supplementary Figure 2 are nice in showing a dissociation from (objective) coherence, such that even within a coherence level, changes in eccentricity scale with direction precision - but this does not get around the potential conflation of confidence with fluctuations in motion energy).</p>
<p>In other words, in this deflationary framing, what the subjects might be doing is tracking two features of the world - motion strength and direction. This possibility needs to be ruled out if the authors want to claim a mapping between eccentricity and decision confidence (for instance, an ideal observer model of the task that set eccentricity proportional to instantaneous motion strength presumably would also sensibly accrue reward targets, without the need to compute confidence in the direction response). This would be straightforward to simulate and would establish a baseline model against which to compare claims about confidence (eg when evaluating additional social modulations). More generally it casts doubt on claims such as the one on line 210 that eccentricity was &quot;chosen freely via metacognitive assessment of the current perceptual process, [and] can be treated as a proxy measure of subjective perceptual confidence.&quot;</p>
<p>One route to doing this would be to ask whether the eccentricity reports show statistical signatures of confidence that have been established for more classical punctate tasks. Here a key move has been to identify qualitative patterns in the frame of reference of choice accuracy - with confidence scaling positively with stimulus strength for correct decisions, and negatively with stimulus strength for incorrect decisions (the so-called X-pattern, for instance Sanders et al. 2016 Neuron <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27151640/">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27151640/</ext-link>).</p>
<p>(2) I was surprised not to see more analysis of the continuous report data as a function of (lagged) task variables. Some of this analysis is shown in Figure 2b relative to an (objective) direction change, and also in the cross-correlation plots in Supplementary Figure 1d. But to fully characterise the task behaviour it also seems important to ask how and whether fluctuations in motion energy (assuming that the RDK frames were recorded) during a steady state phase are affecting continuous reporting of direction and eccentricity, prior to asking how social information is incorporated into subjects' behaviour.</p>
<p>Minor points:</p>
<p>(1) Lines 295-298, isn't it guaranteed to observe these three behavioural patterns (both participants improving, both getting worse, only one improving while the other gets worse) even in random data?</p>
<p>(2) Lines 703-707, it wasn't clear what the AUC values referred to here (also in Figure 3) - what are the distributions that are being compared? I think part of the confusion here comes from AUC being mentioned earlier in the paper as a measure of metacognitive sensitivity (correct vs. incorrect trial distributions), whereas my impression here is that here AUC is being used to investigate differences in variables (eg confidence) between experimental conditions.</p>
<p>(3) Could the findings of the worse solo player benefitting more than the better solo player (Figure 4c) be partly due to a compressive ceiling effect - eg there is less room to move up the psychometric function for the higher-scoring player?</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Schneider et al examine perceptual decision-making in a continuous task setup when social information is also provided to another human (or algorithmic) partner. The authors track behaviour in a visual motion discrimination task and report accuracy, hit rate, wager, and reaction times, demonstrating that choice wager is affected by social information from the partner.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>There are many things to like about this paper. The visual psychophysics has been undertaken with much expertise and care to detail. The reporting is meticulous and the coverage of the recent previous literature is reasonable. The research question is novel.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The paper is difficult to read. It is very densely written, with little to distinguish between what is a key message and what is an auxiliary side note. The Figures are often packed with sometimes over 10 panels and very long captions that stick to the descriptive details but avoid clarity. There is much that could be shifted to supplementary material for the reader to get to the main points.</p>
<p>Example: In lines 176-181, we read about reaction times in the motion task with a level of detail and repetition that has very little relevance to the message of the paper. When we get to social condition and we read about RT in lines 239-243, it is not quite clear what it is that we should take away from this.</p>
<p>Another example: the word &quot;eccentricity&quot; is used to refer to &quot;deviation from central position&quot; as a measure of wager. But we see in Figure 1 that it actually refers to the width of the ARC straddling the reported direction of motion. The confusion is compounded when we see in Figure 2b that the two subjects' different levels of confidence are (short red and long green) arcs at the SAME Eccentricity and overlap one another. The use of the word eccentricity is clearly driven by the Joystick action description and is in direct conflict with the meaning of what eccentricity is in visual perception.</p>
<p>A third and very important one is what the word &quot;dyadic&quot; refers to in the paper. The subjects do not make any joint decisions. However, the authors calculate some &quot;dyadic score&quot; to measure if the group has been able to do better than individuals. So the word dyadic sometimes refers to some &quot;nominal&quot; group. In other places, dyadic refers to the social experimental condition. For example, we see in Figure 3c that AUC is compared for solo vs dyadic conditions. This is confusing.</p>
<p>A key problem with the paper is that it introduces many terms and the main text often overlooks defining them clearly. I still do not understand the difference between Accuracy and Hit in the paper's jargon. The same goes for &quot;score&quot;. Please note that the answer &quot;this is defined in the supplementary method&quot; is not acceptable. These are key constructs in the paper. The flow of the paper's main text depends on them.</p>

<body>
<p>We sincerely thank you for your constructive and insightful feedback on our manuscript, including the assessment of its strengths and suggestions for improvements. This will allow us to enhance the clarity and impact of our work. In our revised manuscript, we will address your recommendations as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Disambiguating whether the joystick eccentricity reflects the subject’s confidence or simply the perceived stimulus strength or coherence</p>
<p>We agree that this is a pivotal issue for the interpretation of our results. We are confident that the joystick “eccentricity” (i.e., radial joystick deviation from the center) does not simply correlate with the moment-to-moment fluctuations of stimulus coherence. The observations that the radial joystick response varied considerably more than the stimulus fluctuations within each subject and each coherence level, and the analysis of metacognitive sensitivity, suggest that subjects indeed incorporated confidence judgements into their continuous reports. As proposed, we will further explore the established signatures of metacognitive confidence reports, and we will quantify the motion energy fluctuations within time intervals where the nominal stimulus parameters remained constant, to examine whether accuracy and confidence levels vary in response to these fluctuations. This approach will provide deeper insights into continuous dynamics within our paradigm.</p>
<p>(2) Rationale for Social Investigation</p>
<p>We will clarify the rationale and methodology of the social aspects in our experiments to better contextualize our approach and findings and their relationship to the field of collective decision-making. In particular, we will further emphasize that while our paradigm indeed did not impose integrating the information from the partner and did not involve incentives for collectively solving the task, the participants could (and did) incorporate the social information into their judgements and mostly improved their earnings. In this way, our approach complements the studies that required joint decisions.</p>
<p>(3) Streamlining and Terminology</p>
<p>We will streamline the text and figure legends to present our main arguments more concisely and improve the overall flow of the manuscript. Additionally, we will include a glossary to the main text to clarify terminology, enhancing accessibility and ensuring consistent understanding of key terms throughout the paper.</p>
<p>To clarify two of the points upfront, we indeed used the term “eccentricity” not in a visual science sense but as the measure of radial joystick deviation from the center and the corresponding angular width of the response arc; we now realize that this is confusing in the context of visual psychophysics paper and will use another word. The term “dyadic” was meant to describe the experimental condition when two participants worked on the task, and associated measures of performance in this condition. The “dyadic score”, defined as the average score across the two participants in the dyadic condition, will be renamed as “combined score”.</p>
<p>(4) Incorporation of Additional Literature</p>
<p>We acknowledge and appreciate the recommendations for additional relevant literature, which we will incorporate into our discussion. This will allow us to contextualize our findings more thoroughly within the existing body of research and highlight the broader implications of our work.</p>
