<title>Abstract</title><p>Cell survival in metazoans depends on cell attachment to the extracellular matrix (ECM) or to neighboring cells. Loss of such attachment triggers a type of programmed cell death known as anoikis, the acquisition of resistance to which is a key step in cancer development. The mechanisms underlying anoikis resistance remain unclear, however. The intracellular F-actin cytoskeleton plays a key role in sensing the loss of cell-ECM attachment, but how its disruption affects cell fate during such stress is not well understood. Here we reveal a cell survival strategy characterized by formation of a giant unilocular vacuole (GUVac) in the cytoplasm of the cells whose actin cytoskeleton is disrupted during loss of matrix attachment. Time-lapse imaging and electron microscopy showed that large vacuoles with a diameter of &gt;500 nm accumulated early after inhibition of actin polymerization in cells in suspension culture, and that these vacuoles subsequently coalesced to form a GUVac. GUVac formation was found to result from a variation of a macropinocytosis-like process, characterized by the presence of inwardly curved membrane invaginations. This phenomenon relies on both F-actin depolymerization and the recruitment of septin proteins for micron-sized plasma membrane invagination. The vacuole fusion step during GUVac formation requires PI(3)P produced by VPS34 and PI3K-C2α on the surface of vacuoles. Furthermore, its induction after loss of matrix attachment conferred anoikis resistance. Our results thus show that the formation of a previously unrecognized organelle promotes cell survival in the face of altered actin and matrix environments.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Cells of higher organisms contain various functional organelles with characteristic morphologies. These organelles compartmentalize the cell interior and are dynamically remodeled or newly formed as adaptive responses to changes in the cellular environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Jang et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Scott et al., 2004</xref>). The formation of large intracellular vacuoles has been observed across diverse eukaryotic species. Most plant cells, for example, contain a large acidic vacuole that occupies most of the cell volume and functions to maintain turgor pressure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Taiz, 1992</xref>). Large vacuoles have also been described in mammalian cells. In the developing vascular system, for instance, the emergence of a sizeable intracellular vacuole is thought to underlie endothelial lumenization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Kamei et al., 2006</xref>). Furthermore, glioblastoma cells expressing oncogenic Ras protein manifest increased macropinocytosis and accumulation of large cytoplasmic vacuoles that result in a nonapoptotic form of cell death known as methuosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Maltese and Overmeyer, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Overmeyer et al., 2008</xref>). White adipocytes in fat tissue also form a large unilocular sac (lipid droplet) that occupies most of the cytoplasm but contains lipids rather than extracellular fluid. However, whether the ability to form large vacuoles is a generally conserved functional program across mammalian cell types has remained unknown.</p>
<p>Loss of extracellular matrix (ECM) attachment in normal epithelial cells can induce a form of programmed cell death known as anoikis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Frisch and Francis, 1994</xref>). However, metastatic tumor cells occasionally circumvent such death induction by cell-cell adhesion and cell clustering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Labuschagne et al., 2019</xref>). Both cell-ECM interaction and cell-cell adhesion directly affect the actin cytoskeleton via integrin or cadherin proteins, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Bachir et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bertocchi et al., 2017</xref>). However, whether extracellular information transmitted to the cell interior via the actin cytoskeleton determines cell fate, such as cell survival or death, has been unclear.</p>
<p>We now show that, in normal epithelial cells that are highly sensitive to the loss of matrix attachment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Debnath et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Schafer et al., 2009</xref>), acute disruption of the actin cytoskeleton in matrix-detached cells promotes cell survival rather than cell death (i.e., anoikis resistance). This survival is associated with the emergence of a giant unilocular vacuole, or GUVac, that occupies most of the cell volume. The formation of this giant organelle was found to depend on a previously undescribed form of macropinocytosis that requires actin depolymerization and septin recruitment for micron-sized inward plasma membrane curvature. Genetic suppression of GUVac formation in matrix-detached cells led to cell death in response to inhibition of actin polymerization, suggesting that GUVac formation is essential for cell survival in an altered matrix environment. Our findings have thus uncovered a cellular strategy based on the formation of a unique type of organelle to ensure cell survival under conditions of cellular stress.</p>

<title>Formation of GUVacs Induced by F-Actin Disruption in Epithelial cells Originating from Secretory tissues in the Absence of Matrix Attachment</title>
<p>Detachment of MCF-10A human mammary epithelial cells from ECM has previously been shown to induce entosis, a nonapoptotic form of cell death initiated by the invasion of one cell by another and resulting in the formation of an entotic vacuole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Overholtzer et al., 2007</xref>). While exploring this phenomenon, we occasionally found an unusual type of cell that contained a single giant unilocular vacuole (hereafter referred to as a GUVac) that occupied almost the entire cytoplasm (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure1 <italic>A</italic></xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig"><italic>B</italic></xref>). These GUVacs differed from entotic vacuoles in that they did not contain cells (that is, no cell-in-cell structures were apparent). Given that ECM detachment results in a gradual change in the actomyosin cytoskeleton, we tested whether changes to either actin or myosin might be associated with GUVac formation. Treatment with latrunculin B (LatB) or cytochalasin D (CytoD), inhibitors of F-actin polymerization, induced a gradual increase in the number of cells with a GUVac during suspension in both MCF10A and human primary mammary epithelial cells (HMEpiCs) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1<italic>C</italic></xref> to <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig"><italic>E</italic></xref>, <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1-figure supplement 1A</xref>). In contrast, treatment with an actin stabilizer (jasplakinolide), an inhibitor of microtubule polymerization (nocodazole), a myosin inhibitor (blebbistatin), or inhibitors of Rho, the Rho kinase ROCK (Y-27632), Rac (EHT 1864), or Cdc42 (ML 141) had no such effect (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1<italic>C</italic></xref> to <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig"><italic>F</italic></xref>). To further demonstrate the effect of actin depolymerization on GUVac formation, we overexpressed the SpvB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Harterink et al., 2017</xref>), a toxin derived from <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> that can cause complete loss of actin filaments in cells and observed similar phenotype to cells treated with LatB (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure1<italic>G</italic></xref> <italic>and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">H</xref></italic>), confirming that actin depolymerization during the loss of matrix attachment promotes GUVac formation. To investigate the potential of generating GUVac in response to actin stress across various cell lines, we examined established cell lines derived from multiple tissues. Interestingly, we noted that cells originating from secretory tissues, such as gastric (HFE-145, AGS, MKN-45), thyroid (BCPAP), and pancreatic (PANC-1) tissues, displayed a tendency to form GUVac, similar to what was observed in mammary MCF10A and HMEpic cells. In contrast, cell types from other tissues did not exhibit this phenomenon (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1<italic>C, E</italic></xref>, and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig"><italic>I</italic></xref>, <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1-figure supplement 1A</xref> and <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">B</xref>). These results suggested that the development of GUVac might be an intrinsic adaptive program specific to epithelial cells derived from secretory tissues.</p>

<p>To obtain further insight into the process of GUVac formation, we carefully examined suspended cells collected at various times after exposure to LatB. At 6 h after the onset of LatB treatment, suspended cells already contained several indentations resembling nascent vacuoles at the cell surface, whereas cells treated with dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) vehicle did not (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1<italic>J</italic></xref>). Examination of the cells at 12 and 24 h revealed that the resulting vacuoles gradually increased in size and fused with each other, eventually giving rise to one giant vacuole (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1<italic>J</italic></xref>). We validated these observations by live imaging of suspended MCF-10A cells expressing both mCherry-H2B, which labels nuclei, and plasma membrane–targeted enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP). Time-lapse images clearly confirmed that individual nascent vacuoles that arose at ∼2 h after exposure to LatB became enlarged and eventually merged into one GUVac (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1<italic>K</italic></xref>), consistent with the analysis of fixed samples. Adherent cells or suspended cells incubated with reconstituted basement membrane (Matrigel) did not form GUVacs under treatment with LatB or cytochalasin D, suggesting that matrix attachment suppresses GUVac formation (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1-figure supplement 1C</xref> and <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">D</xref>).</p>

<title>Macropinocytosis-like Process Contributes to GUVac Formation</title>
<p>To further characterize the mechanism of GUVac biogenesis, we next applied transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to examine the ultrastructure of matrix-detached MCF-10A cells at various times after exposure to LatB. At 6 h, we detected inwardly curved structures at the plasma membrane in LatB-treated cells but not in DMSO-treated cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2 <italic>A</italic></xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig"><italic>B</italic></xref>). The diameter of these endocytic structures was &gt;500 nm, similar to that of macropinocytosis-derived endosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Swanson, 2008</xref>). To examine whether GUVac formation is the result of macropinocytosis, we tested the effect of 5-(<italic>N</italic>-ethyl-<italic>N</italic>-isopropyl) amiloride (EIPA), a Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> exchanger inhibitor that is widely applied to block macropinocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Koivusalo et al., 2010</xref>). Treatment with EIPA resulted in significant inhibition of GUVac formation in suspended cells treated with LatB (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2<italic>C</italic></xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig"><italic>D</italic></xref>). We also observed that LatB-treated suspended cells engulfed fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled high molecular weight dextran (70 kDa), which is not capable of being taken up by micropinocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Li et al., 2015</xref>). This engulfment was inhibited by EIPA (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2<italic>E</italic></xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig"><italic>F</italic></xref>). We next utilized super-resolution structured illumination microscopy (SIM) to examine this phenomenon in live cells at earlier time points following LatB treatment. We found that a portion of the plasma membrane stained with CellMask showed signs of invagination with a diameter of approximately 1 µm. Within one hour after LatB treatment, these invaginations eventually pinched away from the cell surface. In contrast, control cells did not exhibit any inward plasma membrane invaginations (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2<italic>G</italic></xref>, Video 1, and <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2-figure supplement 1A</xref>). The live super-resolution imaging results strongly indicate that the formation of large vesicles (0.5∼1 µm in diameter) primarily originates from the invaginated plasma membrane. Furthermore, we visualized the live uptake of high molecular weight dextran (70 kDa) in conjunction with CellMask plasma membrane staining in suspended cells immediately after LatB treatment. We observed the gradual accumulation of dextran-positive macropinosomes in LatB-treated cells, but such accumulation was not observed in control cells. These macropinosomes were found to be colocalized with the invaginated plasma membrane, as revealed by live spinning-disk confocal and super-resolution SIM images (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2<italic>H</italic></xref>, Video 2, and <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2-figure supplement 1B</xref>). Collectively, these results suggest that the initial formation of these large vesicles results from the internalization of substantial portions of the plasma membrane. This distinctive form of macropinocytosis-like phenomenon responsible for GUVac formation is unique in that it relies on actin depolymerization and exhibits inwardly curved plasma membrane structures, in contrast to the conventional macropinocytosis which entails actin polymerization and the creation of outward membrane protrusions for engulfing extracellular fluid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Swanson, 2008</xref>) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2<italic>I</italic></xref>).</p>

<p>We next sought to determine the molecular mechanism underlying GUVac-associated macropinocytosis-like process. The actin cortex, positioned beneath the plasma membrane, has a crucial function in preserving membrane tension. When disrupted, it can result in micron-sized membrane fluctuations in the continuous membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Cannon et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Weems et al., 2023</xref>). Septins are the only known eukaryotic proteins capable of sensing or inducing micron-scale membrane curvature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Beber et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Benoit et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Cannon et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Shi et al., 2023</xref>). We thus speculated that a member (or members) of the septin family might play a role in the initial step of macroinocytosis-like process. A recent study demonstrated that fluorescent protein-tagged septin 6 is recruited to the plasma membrane of matrix-detached blebbing cells, specifically to the convex region (from an intracellular viewpoint) located between the blebs, where the plasma membrane exhibits an inward curvature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Weems et al., 2023</xref>). Using super-resolution SIM analysis on suspended MCF-10A cells treated with LatB, we observed that mCherry-tagged septin 6 was recruited and organized into a semi-circular structure at the inwardly curved plasma membrane. This recruitment was hindered when the cells were treated with forchlorfenuron (FCF), a known septin inhibitor that hinders the assembly and functionality of septin proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Hu et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Weems et al., 2023</xref>) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3<italic>A</italic></xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">B</xref>). Consistently, treatment with FCF effectively suppressed GUVac formation in suspended MCF-10A cells exposed to LatB (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3<italic>C</italic></xref>). Previous works demonstrated that amphipathic helix (AH) domain enables septins to sense micron-scale membrane curvature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Cannon et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Weems et al., 2023</xref>). We found that the deletion mutant of septin 6 lacking the AH domain failed to be recruited to the membrane of LatB-treated suspended MCF-10A cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3<italic>D</italic></xref>). These findings suggested that septin 6 (potentially along with other members) is recruited to the fluctuating cell membrane via AH domain. This recruitment may then lead to the generation of inward plasma membrane curvature at the micron scale and eventual GUVac formation.</p>

<p>Dynamin plays an important role in the formation of endocytic vesicles by pinching them off from the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Ferguson and De Camilli, 2012</xref>). Given that we observed the pinching off of invaginated portions of the plasma membrane in live super-resolution SIM analysis (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2<italic>G</italic></xref>, Video 1, and <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2-figure supplement 1A</xref>), we therefore investigated whether dynamin also contributes to the accumulation of large vacuoles (0.5∼1µm diameter), and thereby GUVac formation in suspended MCF-10A cells treated with LatB. Knockdown of dynamin 2 or forced expression of a dominant negative form of dynamin 2 (DNM2-K44A) resulted in significant inhibition of GUVac formation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3<italic>E</italic></xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig"><italic>F</italic></xref>). Furthermore, GUVac formation was consistently suppressed in cells treated with various dynamin inhibitors (Dynasore, Dynole 34-2, OctMAB, and MitMAB) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3G</xref>). Together, these results indicated that dynamin-mediated fission of the inwardly curved plasma membrane structures that give rise to the accumulation of multiple vacuoles is required for GUVac formation.</p>

<title>PI(3)P Is Required for the Fusion of Vacuoles Underlying GUVac Formation</title>
<p>We next investigated the mechanism by which vacuoles fuse and give rise to a single giant vacuole during GUVac formation. Phosphoinositides are a minor component of membrane phospholipids but play a key role in remodeling organelle membranes including membrane fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Posor et al., 2022</xref>). To explore the possible role of phosphoinositides in GUVac formation, we first examined the effects of pharmacological and genetic manipulation of PI 3-kinase (PI3K). Treatment with the broad-spectrum PI3K inhibitor LY294002 or the class III PI3K inhibitor VPS34-IN1 resulted in significant attenuation of GUVac formation in LatB-treated suspended MCF-10A cells, whereas the class I PI3K–specific inhibitors GDC-0941 (an inhibitor of p110) or TGX-221 (an inhibitor of p110β) did not (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4<italic>A</italic></xref>). We further revealed that knockdown of class II PI3Kα (PI3K-C2α) or class III PI3K (VPS34), but not that of class I PI3K subunits (p110α or p110β), resulted in marked inhibition of GUVac formation (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4<italic>B</italic></xref> <italic>and</italic> <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4-figure supplement 1A–C</xref>).

<p>Phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate [PI(3)P] can be generated on endocytic vesicles by either VPS34 or PI3K-C2α (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Boukhalfa et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Campa et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Posor et al., 2022</xref>) and plays a key role in the fusion of these vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Orr and Wickner, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Posor et al., 2022</xref>). We therefore reasoned that the generation of PI(3)P by these enzymes might contribute to vacuole fusion during GUVac formation. To investigate this possibility, we applied TEM and super-resolution SIM to observe the size of vacuoles in suspended VPS34 KO, PI3K-C2α KO and VPS34-IN1-treated cells at various time points after LatB treatment. We detected the formation of internal vacuoles at 1, 3 and 6 h in these KO and VPS34-IN1-treated cells as in the WT and vehicle-treated cells. However, in contrast to WT and vehicle-treated cells, in which the vacuoles fused to form a single giant vacuole (i.e., GUVac) over time, the vacuoles in the KO and VPS34-IN1-treated cells did not increase in size even after 12 to 24 h of LatB treatment, resulting in the failure of GUVac formation (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4 <italic>D–F</italic></xref>). Finally, the vacuoles induced in suspended cells by LatB treatment were positive for PI(3)P but not for PI(3,4)P<sub>2</sub> (which can also be generated by PI3K-C2α), as revealed by expression of the specific probes mCherry-2xFYVE and mCherry–PH-TAPP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Posor et al., 2022</xref>), respectively (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4<italic>G</italic></xref>). Collectively, these data indicated that PI(3)P produced on the surface of vacuoles by VPS34 and PI3K-C2α seems to be necessary for the vacuole fusion step during GUVac formation.</p>

<title>GUVac Formation Confers Anoikis Resistance</title>
<p>We next evaluated the physiological relevance of GUVac formation under the stress imposed by changes in matrix attachment and F-actin architecture. Vacuolization in mammalian cells has been suggested to be associated with cytotoxicity and cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Johnson et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Kar et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Papini et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Shubin et al., 2016</xref>). We therefore first tested whether cells with GUVacs are undergoing cell death by immunostaining for cleaved caspase-3, a marker of apoptotic death. Suspended MCF-10A cells under the control condition were typically aggregated and negative for cleaved caspase-3 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5<italic>A–C</italic></xref>), consistent with previous data showing that cadherin-mediated cell-cell adherens junctions prevent anoikis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Hofmann et al., 2007</xref>). In contrast, treatment of suspended cells with EDTA, a Ca<sup>2+</sup> chelator that blocks cadherin function, resulted in significant suppression of cell aggregation (without induction of GUVac formation) and thereby triggered anoikis associated with cleavage of caspase-3. Treatment of suspended cells with LatB also prevented cell aggregation, similar to the effect of EDTA, but it did not induce cleavage of caspase-3 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5 <italic>A–C</italic></xref>). We also detected activation of survival signaling by the kinase AKT and the antiapoptotic protein BCL2 in the LatB-treated cells (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5-figure supplement 1</xref>). To substantiate the finding that matrix-detached cells with the ability to form GUVacs can avoid cell death, we further measured cell viability with a trypan blue exclusion assay. We obtained similar results showing that cells with LatB-induced GUVac formation were protected from EDTA-induced cell death even after prolonged suspension culture (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5<italic>D–F</italic></xref>). Treatment with soluble Fas ligand (sFasL) can induce cell death by the extrinsic apoptotic pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Kischkel et al., 1995</xref>), and we therefore also tested whether GUVac formation allows cells to escape such ligand-induced cell death.</p>

We also monitored the fate of cells with GUVacs after they were returned to the normal adherent condition in the absence of LatB. Time-lapse live imaging revealed that cell adherence to the matrix was followed by the gradual breakup of the GUVac into smaller vacuoles, which were in turn eventually eliminated in association with the adoption of a normal adherent morphology (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5<italic>J</italic></xref>). These observations indicated that GUVac formation is a reversible process that transiently protects cells from a survival-threatening situation.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The mechanisms by which cells acquire resistance to anoikis remain poorly understood. We have now demonstrated the emergence of a hitherto unrecognized organelle, namely GUVac, in mammary epithelial cells, as well as in other cell lines from the secretory organs, triggered by the detachment from the extracellular matrix. GUVac formation is initiated by an unconventional macropinocytosis-like process that requires actin depolymerization and septin recruitment to the plasma membrane to achieve micron-sized inward membrane curvature. The resulting vacuoles that accumulate in the cell gradually merge in a manner dependent on the activity of VPS34 and PI3K-C2α, eventually forming of a single giant membrane-bound sac that occupies a large proportion of the cell volume. Importantly, cells that have developed a GUVac in response to the loss of attachment and disruption of actin architecture manifest resistance to anoikis (<xref rid="figs5a" ref-type="fig">Figure 5-figure supplement 2</xref>). Furthermore, the formation of GUVac is reversible when cells return to normal adherent conditions, suggesting that GUVac formation to support the survival of circulating tumor cells might be reversed when the cells seed the metastatic niche. The precise reason why cells from the secretory organ are highly potential in forming vacuoles is not yet uncovered. However, it is well known that the intracellular vesicle trafficking pathways govern the secretion of cellular cargoes, as the biogenesis of exosome is initiated by plasma membrane curvature and endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Arya et al., 2023</xref>). Thus, the well-developed vesicle trafficking in these cells for providing membranous sources can be one of the explanations.</p>
<p>Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) are cancer cells that have been shed from a primary tumor and circulate in the bloodstream. Sustained detachment from ECM and hemodynamic shear stress threaten the survival of CTCs, with the result that only a small proportion of these cells escape cell death during circulation in the blood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Massague and Obenauf, 2016</xref>). A previous study of the effects of fluid shear stress on the viability of CTCs revealed that surviving cells manifest diminished F-actin assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Xin et al., 2019</xref>). Given our current finding that the inhibition of F-actin assembly in suspended cells promotes GUVac formation, it is plausible that surviving CTCs induce GUVac formation to maintain their viability in the face of hemodynamic shear stress in the blood. Clinical observations have provided evidence of large vacuoles in some breast CTCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Kolostova et al., 2016</xref>). Furthermore, recent research has shown that intracellular microbiota of circulating breast cancer cells promotes host cell survival by increasing resistance to fluid shear stress through disruption of the actin cytoskeleton, thereby facilitating metastatic colonization in breast cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Fu et al., 2022</xref>). Given the ability of various bacterial toxins to disrupt the actin cytoskeleton of host cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Barbieri et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Harterink et al., 2017</xref>) (e.g., SpvB shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">G</xref>), it will be of interest to explore whether breast CTCs harboring intracellular bacteria are able to form GUVacs during their circulation in the bloodstream and whether such potential GUVac formation is reversible after the cells have seeded the metastatic niche. CTCs are also eliminated by immune cells and require strategies to escape from this immune surveillance if they are to establish metastases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Mohme et al., 2017</xref>). The interaction of FasL expressed on natural killer cells and cytotoxic T cells with Fas on CTCs triggers apoptosis in the latter cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Pereira-Veiga et al., 2022</xref>). Of interest in this regard, we found that treatment with sFasL failed to induce apoptosis in mammary epithelial cells containing GUVacs, suggesting that GUVac formation might also function as a mechanism of immune evasion in CTCs. Whether GUVacs are indeed present in CTCs of breast cancer patients and whether such GUVac formation is associated with metastasis warrant further investigation.</p>
<p>Our findings suggest that GUVac formation appear to be relatively specific to cells derived from the secretory tissues such as mammary gland. During pregnancy and lactation in adult female mammals, alveolar epithelial progenitor cells in the mammary gland undergo proliferation and differentiation in response to hormones, forming lobuloalveolar structures for milk production and secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Brisken, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Oakes et al., 2006</xref>). After weaning, a complex tissue remodeling is initiated that removes mammary alveolar epithelium and returns the gland to its prepregnant state (a process known as involution). This process is reversible in mice, such that lactation can be reactivated by resumed suckling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Jena et al., 2019</xref>). Given our current findings, it is possible that, during involution, a subpopulation of mammary epithelial cells that specifically contain GUVacs may circumvent this massive cell death program and survive to serve as a reservoir capable of rapid repopulation and restoration of milk-secreting alveoli if lactation is required. Marked changes to the matrix environment are also induced during involution as a result of degradation of the basement membrane by proteases such as matrix metalloproteinases and urokinase-type plasminogen activator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Lund et al., 1996</xref>). The response of mammary alveolar epithelial cells to such basement membrane disruption may involve GUVac formation as a result of the impairment of cell-ECM adhesion. Further exploration of the physiology of GUVac-containing cells in the mammary gland might provide new insight into gland function.</p>

<title>Plasmids</title>
<p>Complementary DNAs encoding mCherry-H2B and membrane-targeted EGFP tagged with Igκ leader sequence at the N-terminal and transmembrane domain of platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) at the C-terminal were cloned into the pBABE-puro vector. A cDNA for GFP-tagged mouse septin 6 was obtained from Addgene (plasmid #38296) and cloned into the pLVX-IRES-puro vector (Clontech); the GFP sequence was then replaced with the mCherry sequence to generate a construct encoding mCherry–septin 6. pLVX-IRES-puro-mCherry-ΔAH septin 6 was generated by removing amino acids 355-372 from pLVX-IRES-puro-mCherry-septin 6 through PCR. The cDNAs for WT and dominant negative (K44A) forms of rat dynamin 2 were cloned into the pMSCV-puro vector. The cDNAs for GFP-tagged two FYVE domains of mouse HRS and PH domain of human TAPP1 were obtained from Addgene (#140047 and #161985, respectively) and cloned into the pLVX-IRES-puro vector; the GFP sequence was then replaced with mCherry sequence to generate constructs encoding mCherry-2xFYVE and mCherry-PH-TAPP1. The cDNAs for eGFP-tagged SpvB(Salmonella SpvB 375-591) sequence were obtained from Addgene (#89446) and cloned into the pMSCV-puro vector.</p>

<title>Super Resolution 3D-Structured Illumination Microscopy (SIM) Imaging</title>
<p>Cells were seeded on 35-mm confocal dishes and processed for immunofluorescence analysis as described above. The 3D-SIM images were obtained using a Ti-2 inverted microscope (Nikon) equipped with the Ziva Light Engine (Lumencor) as a light source. The Ziva Light Engine generates 405, 488, 561, and 640 nm lasers for excitation. To verify the alignment of multiple channels, we utilized multi-spectrum microbeads (TetraSpeck™ Microspheres, 0.1 µm, T7279) before imaging. The raw images consisted of 15 individual frames, which were captured under five distinct patterned illuminations and three different illumination angles. Sequential image acquisition was performed based on the excitation channel using a high-resolution sCMOS camera with a large field of view (FOV) (Hamamatsu Photonics K.K., ORCA-Flash4.0 sCMOS camera, 2048×2048 pixels). Subsequently, the acquired 3D-SIM images were reconstructed using NIS-Elements (Nikon) software.</p>

<title>Live-Cell Imaging by Time-Lapse Microscopy</title>
<p>MCF-10A cells stably expressing mCherry-H2B and membrane-targeted EGFP were seeded with LatB in 35-mm confocal dishes (SPL Life Sciences, 210350) and imaged with a spinning-disk confocal microscope (Nikon CSU-W1) equipped with a live-cell environmental chamber (Okolab) containing a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO<sub>2</sub> and maintained at 37°C. Images were acquired every 10 min for 24 h and were processed with ImageJ software. For live-cell imaging of the reattachment of GUVac-containing cells, the cells were washed several times with fresh culture medium to remove LatB and reseeded on poly-L-lysine–coated 35-mm confocal dishes. After 14 h, adherent GUVac-containing cells were subjected to confocal imaging as described above. Images were acquired every 5 min for 24 h and were processed with ImageJ software. For live-cell imaging of CellMask-labeled plasma membrane and 70 kDa tetramethylrodamine (TMR)-dextran, MCF-10A cells were trypsinized, collected, and resuspended with media containing CellMask Plasma Membrane Stains Deep Red (1:1,000). To acquire time-lapse images of live suspended cells in fixed positions right after treatment with DMSO or LatB, cells were suspended on confocal dishes coated in fibronectin. The dishes were incubated at 37°C for 5 minutes, which allowed cells to attach to the dishes with the round cell shape slightly. The media were changed to new ones containing CellMask (1:10,000), 70 kDa TMR-dextran (0.1 mg/ml), and DMSO or LatB, and the cells were immediately imaged with a spinning-disk confocal or SIM microscope. Images were acquired every 30 sec for 1 h. The images obtained from a spinning-disk confocal microscope were denoised by NIS-Elements (Nikon)’s Denoise.ai, and 3D-SIM images were reconstructed using NIS-Elements (Nikon) software.</p>

<caption><p>Hypothetical model for the formation of GUVac that enhances the anoikis resistance. In matrix-attached cells, cortical actin and extracellular matrix (ECM) attachment suppresses plasma membrane (PM) fluctuation and maintains membrane tension. However, in matrix-detached cells with disrupted cortical actin, the PM exhibits micron-scale membrane fluctuations. This promotes the recruitment of septin to the micrometer-sized inwardly curved plasma membrane via its amphipathic helix (AH) domain and the subsequent recruitment further accelerates the PM invagination. As a result of this macropinocytosis-like process, followed by dynamin-mediated pinching off, vacuoles accumulate within the cell and gradually coalesce, a process facilitated by the synthesis of PI(3)P, involving the activity of VPS34 and PI3K-C2α. Eventually, these processes lead to the formation of GUVac. Cells that possess GUVac demonstrate resistance to anoikis. The schematic was generated using Biorender.</p></caption>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors found that the loss of cell-ECM adhesion leads to the formation of giant monocular vacuoles in mammary epithelial cells. This process takes place in a macropinocytosis-like process and involves PI3 kinase. They further identified dynamin and septin as essential machinery for this process. Interestingly, this process is reversible and appears to protect cells from cell death.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The data are clean and convincing to support the conclusions. The analysis is comprehensive, using multiple approaches such as SIM and TEM. The discussion on lactation is plausible and interesting.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>As the first paper describing this phenomenon, it is adequate. However, the elucidation of the molecular mechanisms is not as exciting as it does not describe anything new. It is hoped that novel mechanisms will be elucidated in the future. In particular, the molecules involved in the reversing process could be quite interesting. Additionally, the relationship to conventional endocytic compartments, such as early and late endosomes, is not analyzed.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The manuscript &quot;Formation of a giant unilocular vacuole via macropinocytosis-like process confers anoikis resistance&quot; describes an interesting observation and provides initial steps towards understanding the underlying molecular mechanism.</p>
<p>The manuscript describes that the majority of non-tumorigenic mammary gland epithelial cells (MCF-10A) in suspension initiate entosis. A smaller fraction of cells form a single giant unilocular vacuole (hereafter referred to as a GUVac). GUVac appeared to be empty and did not contain invading (entotic) cells. The formation of GUVac could be promoted by disrupting actin polymerisation with LatB and CytoD. The formation of GUVacs correlated with resistance to anoikis. GUVac formation was detected in several other epithelial cells from secretory tissues.</p>
<p>The authors then use electron microscopy and super-resolution imaging to describe the biogenesis of GUVac. They find that GUVac formation is initiated by a micropinocytosis-like phenomenon (that is independent of actin polymerisation). This process leads to the formation of large plasma membrane invaginations, that pinch off from the PM to form larger vesicles that fuse with each other into GUVacs.</p>
<p>Inhibition of actin polymerisation in suspended MCF-10a leads to the recruitment of Septin 6 to the PM via its amphipathic helix. Treatment with FCF (a septin polymerisation inhibitor) blocked GUVac biogenesis, as did pharmacological inhibition of dynamin-mediated membrane fission. The fusion of these vesicles in GUVacs required (perhaps not surprisingly) PI3P.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors have made an interesting and potentially important observation. They describe the formation of an endo-lysosomal organelle (a giant unilocular vacuole - GUVac) in suspended epithelial cells and correlate the formation of GUVacs with resistance to aniokis.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>My major concern is the experimental strategy that is used throughout the paper to induce and study the formation GUVac. Almost every experiment is conducted in suspended cells that were treated with actin depolymerising drugs (e.g. LatB) and thus almost all key conclusions are based on the results of these experiments. I only have a few suggestions that would improve these experiments or change their outcome and interpretation.</p>
<p>Yet, I believe it is essential to identify the endogenous pathway leading to the actin depolymerisation that drives the formation of GUVacs in detached epithelial cells (or alternatively to figure out how it is suppressed in most detached cells). A first step in that direction would be to investigate the polymerization status of actin in MCF-10a cells that 'spontaneously' form GUVacs and to test if these cells also become resistant to anoikis.</p>
<p>Also, it would be great (and I believe reasonably easy) to better characterise molecular markers of GUVacs (LAMP's, Rab's, Cathepsins, etc....) to discriminate them from other endosomal organelles</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Loss of cell attachment to extracellular matrix (ECM) triggers aniokis (a type of programmed cell death), and resistance to aniokis plays a role in cancer development. However, mechanisms underlying anoikis resistance, and the precise role of F-actin, are not fully known.</p>
<p>Here the authors describe the formation of a new organelle, giant unilocular vacuole (GUVac), in cells whose F-actin is disrupted during loss of matrix attachment. GUVac formation (diameter &gt;500 nm) resulted from a previously unrecognised macropinocytosis-like process, characterized by inwardly curved micron-sized plasma membrane invaginations, dependent on F-actin depolymerization, septin recruitment, and PI(3)P. Finally, the authors show GUVac formation after loss of matrix attachment promotes resistance to anoikis.</p>
<p>From these results, the authors conclude that GUVac formation promotes cell survival in environments where F-actin is disrupted and conditions of cell stress.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The manuscript is clear and well-written, figures are all presented at a very high level.</p>
<p>A variety of cutting-edge cell biology techniques (eg time-lapse imaging, EM, super-resolution microscopy) are used to study the role of the cytoskeleton in GUVac formation. It is discovered that: (i) a macropinocytosis-like process dependent on F-actin depolymerisation, SEPT6 recruitment, and PI(3)P contributes to GUVac formation, and (ii) GUVac formation is associated with resistance to cell death.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The manuscript is highly reliant on the use of drugs, or combinations of drugs, for long periods of time (6hr, 18hr..). Wherever possible the authors should test conclusions drawn from experiments involving drugs also using other canonical cell biology approaches (eg siRNA, Crispr). Although suggestive as a first approach, it is not reliable to draw conclusions from experiments where only drug combinations are being advanced (eg LatB + FCF).</p>
<p>F-actin is well known to play a wide variety of roles in cell death and other canonical cell death pathways (PMID: 26292640). The authors show using pharmacological inhibition that F-actin is key for GUVac formation. However, especially when testing for physiological relevance, how can these other roles for F-actin be ruled out?</p>
<p>To test the role of septins in GUVac formation only recruitment studies and no direct functional work is performed. A drug forchlofeneuron (FCF) is used, but this is well known to have off-target effects (PMID: 27473917).</p>
<p>Cells that possess GUVac are resistant to aniokis, but how are these cells resistant? This report is focused on mechanisms underlying GUVac formation and does not directly test for mechanisms underlying aniokis resistance.</p>
