<title>Abstract</title><p>Age-related hearing loss is a complex phenomenon. The earliest-onset degenerative event is the gradual loss of neural connections between cochlea and auditory brainstem. To probe for perceptual deficits that might arise from this loss, cochlear synaptopathy was induced pharmacologically in young-adult gerbils which were then tested in a challenging listening task for the perception of temporal fine structure. Treated gerbils behaved no differently than normal-hearing, young-adult animals. In contrast, old gerbils, which typically express many cochlear and central-neural pathologies, showed impaired perception. To probe for the underlying mechanisms, single-unit responses were obtained from the auditory nerve to the same test stimuli. Responses from old gerbils showed no impairment in temporal locking to the stimulus fine structure. However, responses were significantly more driven by slower temporal fluctuations of the stimulus envelope, suggesting that the central auditory system may be unable to extract the relevant information for discrimination from such altered inputs.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Many elderly people have difficulties understanding speech in noisy environments, despite having normal tone-detection thresholds in quiet. This condition of compromised supra-threshold perception, for example of speech in background noise (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Füllgrabe et al. 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Gómez-Álvarez et al. 2023</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Lopez-Poveda 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Moore 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Parthasarathy et al. 2020</xref>), despite an absence of detectable hearing deficits in the pure-tone audiogram in quiet, is referred to as hidden hearing loss (HHL, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Schaette and McAlpine 2011</xref>). It has been suggested that HHL is associated with a reduced number of synapses between auditory-nerve fibers and inner hair cells, which is commonly referred to as cochlear synaptopathy (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Bharadwaj et al. 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Kujawa and Liberman 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Liberman 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Liberman and Kujawa 2017</xref>). Synaptopathy is one of the aging processes in the cochlea, and, in addition, can be caused by excessive noise exposure, both accumulating during a human’s life time (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Liberman et al. 2016</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">Wu et al. 2019</xref>, but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Johannesen et al. 2019</xref>). Animal experiments demonstrate that exposure to loud sounds can produce such synaptopathy, even without permanent loss in hearing sensitivity (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Kujawa and Liberman 2009</xref>). Furthermore, the number of functional synapses decreases with increasing age (e.g., gerbil: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bovee et al. 2024</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Gleich et al. 2016</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Steenken et al. 2021</xref>; mouse: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Jeng et al. 2020</xref>, Parthasaraty and Kujawa 2018, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Sergeyenko et al. 2013</xref>; rat: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Cai et al. 2018</xref>; human: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">Viana et al. 2015</xref>).</p>
<p>Synaptopathy is postulated to be causal for compromised processing of temporal stimulus features (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Parthasarathy and Kujawa 2018</xref>), especially of the temporal fine structure (TFS) of sounds (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Moore 2019</xref>), resulting in difficulties of speech comprehension in background noise. Specific psychophysical tests that evaluate the performance to distinguish between stimuli that differ in TFS have been developed. These tasks are then expected to be sensitive to synaptopathy (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Moore 2014</xref>). The most commonly used test is the TFS1 test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Moore and Sek 2009</xref>) which probes the discrimination of harmonic and inharmonic tone complexes that strongly differ in TFS but only marginally in the envelope of the waveform. The previously found link between diminished perception of stimuli differing in TFS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Moore et al. 2006</xref>) and SNHL in human patients has also been found in TFS1 test results (Mathew et al. 2015). Furthermore, a correlation between age and TFS1 sensitivity has been observed (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Eipert et al. 2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Füllgrabe et al. 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Moore et al. 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>Whereas post-mortem studies of human subjects have provided evidence for age-related synapse loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">Viana et al. 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">Wu et al. 2019</xref>), it has been impossible to relate this loss to HHL; that is, deficits in supra-threshold sound perception of living subjects. Animal studies have suggested a close correlation between the number of surviving synapses and supra-threshold amplitude growth of auditory brainstem responses (ABRs) or compound action potentials (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Bourien et al. 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bramhall et al. 2018</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Buran et al. 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Kujawa and Liberman 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Lin et al. 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Sergeyenko et al., 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Shi et al. 2016</xref>). A number of attempts have been made to infer the synapse loss in humans from non-invasive physiological measures, such as ABR, and psychophysical measures of the processing of sounds. However, even studies involving large samples of human subjects have not produced strong evidence that synaptopathy in humans has functional consequences for supra-threshold temporal perception (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Bramhall et al. 2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Carcagno and Plack 2022</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Guest et al. 2018</xref>). Attempts to relate life-time noise exposure of human subjects to their supra-threshold perceptual deficits have also not been conclusive (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Prendergast et al. 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Füllgrabe et al. 2020</xref>). Controlled animal studies are one strategy for testing the influence of synapse loss on discrimination of complex sounds that differ in TFS. In those, synaptopathy can be experimentally manipulated and the degree of cochlear dysfunction can be related to neural responses and performance in behavioral tests, using the same stimuli. With this approach we can test the hypothesis whether synaptopathy negatively affects the discrimination of stimuli that differ in their TFS.</p>
<p>Animal studies relating behavioral measures of performance in response to a variety of stimuli to synaptopathy have so far also provided mixed results (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Henry 2022</xref>). An investigation by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Henry and Abrams (2021)</xref>, which experimentally induced synaptopathy in budgerigars by kainic acid infusions at the round window, failed to demonstrate a relationship between the amplitude of the compound action potential (taken as a measure of cochlear synaptopathy) and tone-detection thresholds in noise. Studies in Macaque monkeys that produced a noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) by acoustic trauma demonstrate differences between normal-hearing and acoustically traumatized monkeys for a) tone detection in noise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Burton et al. 2020</xref>), b) masking release for tone detection in modulated maskers compared to unmodulated maskers, and c) spatial release from masking for tone detection in noise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Mackey et al. 2021</xref>). However, these studies used high trauma levels and long exposure durations. Thus, effects were not limited to synapse loss at the inner hair cell but included both outer- and inner-hair-cell damage. Studies in chinchilla auditory-nerve (AN) fibers, involving normal-hearing subjects and subjects with NIHL, did reveal differences in the neural envelope representation but failed to demonstrate differences in the neural representation of TFS that match the psychophysical effects observed in human subjects (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Henry and Heinz 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Kale and Heinz 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Kale et al. 2014</xref>).</p>
<p>To clarify the relation between synaptopathy, AN fiber responses, and behavior, we embarked on a study in Mongolian gerbils (<italic>Meriones unguiculatus</italic>) that combined behavioral measurements of sensitivity in the TFS1 test and the representation of harmonic and inharmonic complex tones with the same fundamental frequency (f<sub>0</sub>) by AN fibers. In addition, synaptopathy of many of the experimental subjects was characterized by directly counting the numbers of functional synapses on inner hair cells, and these measures were related to sensitivity in the TFS1 test. Because compromised performance in the TFS1 test has been observed in elderly humans, we compared the perception of young-adult and old gerbils. In order to experimentally induce synaptopathy in young-adult gerbils and, thus dissociate the effects of synaptopathy from effects of age, we treated young-adult gerbils with an infusion of ouabain at the round window. This treatment has been shown to reduce the number of synapses on gerbil inner hair cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Bourien et al. 2014</xref>). We observed a lower perceptual sensitivity of old compared to young-adult gerbils in the TFS1 test. However, contrary to our hypothesis, ouabain treatment did not affect the performance in the TFS1 task, and the responses of AN fibers that survived ouabain treatment did not differ from gerbils that were not treated.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<sec id="s2a">
<title>Synapse loss was similar in old gerbils and gerbils treated with a high dosage of ouabain</title>
<p>Synapses were counted at the cochlear location corresponding to 2 kHz in 54 gerbils, divided into the five gerbil groups, as listed in <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, row 4. Young-adult, untreated gerbils had, on average, 23 (SE ±0.5) synapses per inner hair cell (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). Synapse numbers were significantly different between gerbil groups (univariate ANOVA: F = 5.496, p = 0.001). Compared to untreated young adults, the average number of synapses per inner hair cell in gerbils treated with 70 µM ouabain and in old gerbils was significantly reduced, to 19 (SE ±1.4) and 19 (SE ±0.7), respectively (Bonferroni corrected pairwise comparisons: young-adult vs. 70 µM [p = 0.011]; young-adult vs. old [p = 0.002]). No significant difference between ears treated with a high dose of ouabain and old ears was found, indicating that both animal groups had similar degrees of synaptopathy in the region of interest. In surgery-only ears and ears treated with 40 µM ouabain, average synapse numbers (surgery only: 23 (SE ±0.5), 40 µM ouabain: 22 (SE ±0.7)) were not significantly different compared to untreated young-adult ears, suggesting no effect of the surgical procedure itself and no effect of the lower ouabain dose. These results were also consistent across more basal cochlear locations (up to 8 kHz equivalent frequency, see Supplemental Materials). Based on this, we pooled the single-unit data from surgery-only and 40 µM ouabain treated gerbils into a “sham” group. The gerbils treated with 70 µM ouabain are henceforth referred to simply as “ouabain”.</p>

<title>Average rate does not carry sufficient information about inharmonic frequency shift</title>
<p>Spike responses to TFS1 stimuli of 94 AN fibers from 26 animals were recorded (for details see <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> in Materials and Methods). BFs ranged from 470 Hz to 11,528 Hz, with a median of 3,995 Hz. The SRs of these fibers ranged from 0 sp/s to 144 sp/s with a median of 60 sp/s. Average stimulated rates (4.8 sp/s - 223 sp/s, median 135 sp/s) and driven rates (i.e., average rate minus SR, 4.8 sp/s - 215 sp/s, median 67.6 sp/s) were calculated from the spike counts across the stimulus duration of 375 ms, excluding on- and offset ramps.</p>
<p>Most importantly, the inharmonic frequency shift Δf% - as a covariate in the ANOVA - had no significant effect on mean driven rate [F(1;943) = 0.018, p = 0.8933] (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>, overlapping colored and black distribution curves in each panel). The overall distribution of driven rate also did not change substantially with Δf%. Thus, the inharmonic frequency shift had no effect on the mean driven rate, and AN spike rate was not a potential cue for the gerbil in the behavioral task.</p>

<title>Neural representation of TFS was not degraded in AN fibers of old or synaptopathic gerbils</title>
<p>The same set of AN fibers was probed for the neural responses to the fine structure and envelope of TFS1 stimuli (for details see <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) using the TFS log-z-ratio (see section “Neural recordings - Data Analysis”). A high TFS log-z-ratio indicates strong phase locking to the stimulus TFS. The main findings are listed below; for more details see Supplemental Material. Importantly, the inharmonic frequency shift, Δf%, as a covariate in the ANOVA, affected the TFS log-z-ratio significantly and strongly [main effect: F(1;943) = 104.403, p = 2.569×10<sup>-23</sup>], suggesting that AN fibers followed the fine structure of the stimulus and thus represented the frequency shift in their spiking pattern (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A-J</xref>, L). Δf% significantly interacted with stimulus condition and BF-class [interaction: F(2;943) = 20.292, p = 2.353×10<sup>-9</sup>; F(1;943) = 31.050, p = 3.282×10<sup>-8</sup>, respectively]. In response to 400/1600 Hz, the shifts affected the temporal representation most (i.e., higher Δf% resulted in higher TFS log-z-ratios). Additionally, TFS log-z-ratios of low-BF fibers were influenced more by the inharmonic shifts than those of high-BF fibers (again, higher Δf% result in higher TFS log-z-ratios).</p>

Odd rows show the data at f<sub>0</sub> and even rows at f<sub>max</sub>. Each circle represents four dimensions: the stimulus frequency shift Δf (position on the x-axis), the frequency shift of the z-value peak (position on the y-axis), the average vector strength (z-score) across all respective fibers (color saturation, see legend at the bottom), and the percentage of fibers with a frequency shift of the z-value peak at the corresponding stimulus frequency shift Δf (circle radius). The largest circles correspond to 100% of fibers (e.g., in panel C), medium sized circles to values around 50% (e.g., panel J). Colors code the frequency shift Δf, with the harmonic stimulus in black and the inharmonic stimuli fading from yellow (least inharmonic) to red (most inharmonic).

<p>TFS representation by the TFS log-z-ratio metric was not significantly different between AN fibers from different gerbil groups (p = 0.154). Also, no interaction between group and Δf% occurred. Together, this indicates that aged fibers (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D, H, L</xref>) and fibers that survived the treatment with ouabain (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C, G</xref>) had responses that did not differ from young-adult (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A, E, I</xref>) and sham-treated fibers (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B, F, J</xref>). As expected, TFS log-z-ratios of AN fibers responding to the stimulus condition with higher fc were lower, compared to those responding to stimuli with lower fc (200/1600 Hz: 0.987, 400/1600 Hz: 1.111, 400/3200 Hz: 0.394; [main effect: F(2;943) = 7.495, p = 5.894×10<sup>-4</sup>]). This reflects the known decrease in phase-locking with increasing stimulus frequency (Versteegh et al., 2011).</p>

Posthoc comparisons revealed that, for 400/3200 Hz, envelope representation (mean ENV/TFS log-z-ratio = 0.263) was stronger than fine structure representation, indicating stronger phase-locking of AN fibers to low-frequency stimulus components. Furthermore, stimulus condition</p>

<title>Age, but not synapse loss, affected behavioral discrimination of TFS1 stimuli</title>
<p>To investigate the effect of synapse loss on performance in the TFS1 task, the behavior of young-adult gerbils, without and with cochlear synaptopathy, and old gerbils was compared for the different stimulus conditions defined by the combinations of f<sub>0</sub> and fc. The sensitivity of the four groups of gerbils in the different stimulus conditions is illustrated in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>, in relation to the frequency shift Δf%. The sensitivity of young-adult gerbils of the different treatment groups was quite similar, whereas the old gerbils had considerably lower sensitivity. A GLMM ANOVA with the sensitivity <italic>d’</italic> as dependent variable, condition and treatment group as factors, and frequency shift Δf% as a covariate (only trials with Δf% &gt; 5 included, for which data from all treatment groups were obtained), revealed significant main effects of treatment group [F(3,387) = 8.18, p = 2.725×10<sup>-5</sup>], stimulus condition [F(2,387) = 22.71, p = 4.736×10<sup>-10</sup>, and Δf% [F(1,387) = 20.457, p = 8.121×10<sup>-6</sup>]. No significant interactions were observed. There was a general increase in sensitivity with increasing Δf%. Old gerbils showed lower sensitivities than most young-adult gerbils, irrespective of their treatment (all p &lt; 0.002, Bonferroni corrected). There was no significant difference in sensitivity between the treatment groups of young gerbils. To separately investigate the effects of f<sub>0</sub> and harmonic number, N, on sensitivity, we conducted planned comparisons in two additional GLMM ANOVAs, each containing only the data of two conditions, with the same dependent variable and factors as the initial ANOVA. The planned comparison with the data of stimulus conditions 200/1600 Hz and 400/1600 Hz was used to investigate the effect of f<sub>0</sub> (which inherently includes a change in harmonic number, N) on sensitivity. This ANOVA revealed an effect of f<sub>0</sub>, with a higher sensitivity for increasing f<sub>0</sub> [F(1,257) = 45.001, p = 1.248×10<sup>-10</sup>]. Furthermore, an effect of Δf% [F(1, 257) = 13.539, p = 2.847 ×10<sup>-4</sup>] was observed. Similar to the previous analysis, the main effect of gerbil group [F(3, 257) = 4.878, p = 2.570×10<sup>-3</sup>] reflected the low sensitivity of the old gerbils compared to all other groups. The second planned comparison with the data of stimulus conditions 400/3200 Hz and 400/1600 Hz, with equal f<sub>0</sub>, investigated the dependence of sensitivity on fc. An effect of fc [F(1,256) = 12.656, p = 4.459×10<sup>-4</sup>] was shown, with decreasing sensitivity for increasing fc. As in the previous comparison, this ANOVA also revealed increased sensitivity with increasing Δf% [F(1,256) = 13.484, p = 2.929×10<sup>-4</sup>], whereas the main effect of gerbil group [F(3,256) = 4.692, p = 3.299×10<sup>-3</sup>] again reflected the lower sensitivity of the old group compared to all other groups. No interactions were observed in either planned comparison.</p>
<p>The frequency-shift threshold reflects Δf% for a criterion of <italic>d’</italic> = 1 and was calculated for each gerbil and condition. If no threshold could be derived because all <italic>d’</italic> values were below 1, a threshold of 100% f<sub>0</sub> was assumed for further statistical analysis. On average, old gerbils were only able to discriminate inharmonically shifted TFS1 stimuli for the condition 400/1600 Hz (see <italic>d’</italic> values &gt; 1 in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D, H, L</xref>). All young-adult gerbil treatment groups achieved average sensitivities above threshold for all stimulus conditions.</p>

<p>No differences were observed between the young-adult gerbil groups with different treatments. To evaluate the effect of f<sub>0</sub> on the threshold, a planned comparison with the data of stimulus conditions 200/1600 Hz and 400/1600 Hz (i.e., harmonic numbers 8 and 4, respectively) was conducted in an additional ANOVA, with frequency-shift thresholds as dependent variable, and condition and gerbil group as factors. A main effect of condition was revealed, indicating that f<sub>0</sub> (respectively harmonic number N at 1600 Hz fc) did affect the threshold [F(1,40) = 15.219, p = 3.577×10<sup>-4</sup>]. There was no significant effect of gerbil group; all groups showed similarly low thresholds for the 400/1600 Hz condition. A second additional ANOVA with the data of stimulus conditions 400/3200 Hz and 400/1600 Hz (i.e., harmonic numbers 8 and 4, respectively) investigated the dependency of threshold on fc (respectively harmonic number N). An effect of gerbil group [F(3,40) = 10.460, p = 3.272×10<sup>-5</sup>] and condition [F(1,40) = 16.213, p = 2.455×10<sup>-</sup> <sup>4</sup>] was observed. The pairwise comparison revealed lower thresholds with decreasing fc (respectively harmonic number N) and a significant difference between untreated and old gerbils (all p ≤ 0.001), whereas the young-adult gerbil treatment groups did not differ.</p>
<p>In summary, the behavioral data showed that the old gerbils differed from all other treatment groups of young-adult gerbils. This result suggests that age considerably affected both perceptual sensitivity and thresholds while synapse numbers had little effect.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The ability to process temporal fine structure (TFS) of sounds is a key factor for speech perception and its age-related decline has been held responsible for compromised speech comprehension in the elderly, especially in challenging noisy acoustic backgrounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Füllgrabe et al. 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Moore 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">2019</xref>). It has been suggested that age-related or noise-induced synaptopathy results in the observed perceptual deficits regarding the TFS of sounds (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Moore 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">2019</xref>). However, so far a direct test of this hypothesis is lacking. Here, we present data that investigate the performance of the Mongolian gerbil in the TFS1 test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Moore and Sek 2009</xref>), a psychoacoustic paradigm that has been applied in human subjects to evaluate the ability to discriminate between stimuli based on the TFS. We determined the TFS1 test performance in young-adult gerbils and compare this to the performance of old gerbils (≥ 36 months of age, corresponding to humans ≥ 60 years of age, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Castaño-González et al. 2024</xref>), demonstrating an age-related decline in TFS sensitivity similar to that found in human subjects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Füllgrabe et al. 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Moore et al. 2012</xref>). However, young-adult gerbils with experimentally induced synaptopathy (by applying ouabain), to a degree corresponding to the synaptopathy in old gerbils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Steenken et al. 2021</xref>, this study), showed no decline in TFS sensitivity. This result suggests that reduced synapse numbers alone cannot explain the perceptual deficits for TFS in old subjects. Auditory-nerve (AN) fiber responses of young-adult, young-adult ouabain-treated, and old gerbils, elicited by the stimuli presented in the TFS1 test, indicate that the representation of TFS in AN fibers is not affected by ouabain treatment or age. In old gerbils that show compromised TFS1 test performance behaviorally, however, the representation of the signal envelope by AN fibers was enhanced compared to the other groups. We propose that this enhancement of the signal envelope cue, which does not differentiate the stimuli in the TFS1 test, may cause the perceptual deficits in old gerbils by overriding the usability of the TFS cues. Thus, cue representation may cause the perceptual deficits, but not reduced synapse numbers, as originally proposed.</p>
<sec id="s3a">
<title>Gerbil as a model for human temporal-fine-structure perception</title>
<p>In the TFS1 test, subjects must discriminate an inharmonic (I) complex from a harmonic (H) complex, in which the frequency difference between the components determines the period of the envelope. The I complex is created by shifting all components of the H complex by a fixed frequency. This shift results in pairs of I and H complexes with similar envelopes but different TFS. Thus, TFS is the only acoustic cue which allows to discriminate the stimuli. Excitation-pattern differences due to the shift of the frequency components in the I complex compared to the H complex can be eliminated in the TFS1 test by appropriate spectral filtering (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Marmel et al. 2015</xref>). In addition, the gerbil has larger auditory filter bandwidths than human subjects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Kittel et al. 2002</xref>). Since we used a similar filter bandwidth for the gerbil as that applied in studies involving humans (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Eipert et al. 2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Marmel et al. 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Moore and Sek 2009</xref>), cochlear excitation pattern differences are unlikely to have provided usable cues for discrimination by the gerbils in the present study. Furthermore, the noise masker in which the I and H complexes were presented ensured that the stimuli did not produce usable distortion products for the gerbils. Thus, as in the study with human subjects, the only usable cue for the discrimination was the TFS.</p>
<p><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref> provides an overview of gerbil TFS1 thresholds in comparison to human thresholds. Human thresholds were selected from studies involving stimuli with spectral components and fundamental frequencies (f<sub>0</sub>) similar to those presented to the gerbils in the present study, allowing a comparison of gerbil and human performance. There is a broad overlap between gerbil and human TFS1 thresholds. Both, in humans and gerbils, old subjects showed higher (i.e., worse) TFS1 thresholds than young subjects (for human studies see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Eipert et al. 2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Füllgrabe et al. 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Moore et al. 2012</xref>). This similarity indicates that the gerbil is a good model for investigating the mechanisms underlying TFS perception that may also apply to humans. Behavioral TFS1 thresholds in young-adult gerbils with ouabain-induced synaptopathy, similar to that typical for old gerbils, were similar to TFS1 thresholds in untreated young-adult gerbils. This result suggests that increased thresholds in old subjects were not due to the reduced number of synapses. Thus, in the gerbil, the hypothesis that age-related deterioration of TFS perception is a direct consequence of synaptopathy can be rejected.</p>

<title>Auditory-nerve fiber responses do not explain differences in behavioral sensitivity</title>
<p>Since the use of excitation patterns by the gerbil is unlikely due to its larger auditory-filter bandwidths, we explored the temporal responses of AN fibers for alternative explanations of compromised TFS perception. TFS representation requires the ability of AN fibers to phase-lock (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Joris et al. 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Rose et al. 1967</xref>). Here we showed that, throughout all tested gerbil groups, the H and I complexes were neurally distinguishable based on phase-locking to the stimulus fine structure (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>, 4). In contrast, no distinction was possible based on the average firing rate of AN fibers (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). Neural phase-locking reached highest z-values for stimuli with fc of 1600 Hz and were lower for 3200 Hz (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>), which reflects the known decrease in phase-locking of AN fibers for stimuli above 1.5 kHz (Versteegh et al. 2011). Several studies in animal models of cochlear dysfunction showed that phase locking is not compromised in single AN fibers, including quiet-aged gerbils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Heeringa et al. 2020</xref>), noise-exposed cats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Miller et al. 1997</xref>), chinchillas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Henry and Heinz 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Kale et al. 2013</xref>), and kanamycin-treated guinea pigs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Harrison and Evans 1979</xref>). Consistent with these findings, the surviving fibers in old, synaptopathic gerbils did not show compromised temporal fine structure representation of I and H complexes compared to young-adult gerbils (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>, 4).</p>
<p>Old gerbils showed significant synapse loss compared to untreated young-adult gerbils at the cochlear location corresponding to 2 kHz (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>), consistent with what was shown previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Steenken et al. 2021</xref>). Ouabain, a cardiac glycoside that inhibits Na<sup>+</sup>-K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase pumps of AN fibers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">O’Brien et al. 1994</xref>), applied to the round window, results in a dose-dependent loss of AN fibers in gerbils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Bourien et al. 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Lang et al. 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Schmiedt et al. 2002</xref>). In our hands, a low dose (40 µM) of ouabain had no effect at the cochlear location equivalent to 2 kHz. In contrast, a higher dose of 70 µM resulted in a loss that was similar to that observed in old gerbils (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). The surviving fibers of ouabain-treated gerbils showed no deterioration of TFS representation compared to untreated or sham-treated young-adult gerbils (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A,C</xref>,E,G); however, the behavioral outcomes of this study clearly showed that only old gerbils had deteriorated discrimination abilities between H and I complexes. We thus showed conclusively that neither synapse loss, to an extent typical for old gerbils, nor impaired TFS representation, at the level of single AN fibers, could explain the deteriorated perception in old gerbils.</p>

<title>Enhancement of confounding/distracting AN cues and changed central processing may explain the behavioral deficit in old subjects</title>
<p>Surviving AN fibers in old gerbils did not show compromised fine-structure representation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>, 4). However, old gerbils exhibited deteriorated performance in the behavioral test in response to TFS1 test stimuli (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>, 6). Despite the overall robust phase-locking ability, other pathologies are known to develop with advancing age.</p>
<p>First, the age-related atrophy of the stria vascularis within the lateral wall of cochleae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Gratton and Schulte 1995</xref>) results in a decreased endocochlear potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Schulte and Schmiedt 1992</xref>), which in turn increases the threshold (i.e., decreases the sensitivity) of AN fibers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Schmiedt et al. 1996</xref>). Envelope representation, measured as synchronization to amplitude-modulated stimuli, is non-monotonic with sound level, with a pronounced peak near the threshold of the fiber (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Heeringa et al. 2023</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Joris and Yin 1992</xref>). Thus, the typical sensitivity loss in old subjects will cause a difference in neural representations between young-adult and old subjects, even if the test stimulus levels are kept constant. Alternatively, stimulus levels can be raised for old subjects, to an equivalent sensation level that compensates for their sensitivity loss. Consistent with that prediction, AN fibers of old gerbils show enhanced representation of the fundamental frequency of speech vowels, compared to fibers from young adults, when responding to fixed-level stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Heeringa et al. 2023</xref>), but do not show enhanced envelope representation in response to frozen noise presented at similar sensation level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Heeringa et al. 2020</xref>). Old gerbils of the same age as in the present study invariably show hearing loss, although to variable extents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Hellstrom and Schmiedt 1990</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Steenken et al. 2021</xref>). Thus, since TFS1 stimuli in the current study were presented at a fixed absolute level of 68 dB SPL, fibers of old animals were stimulated closer to their individual thresholds than fibers of young adults, which is expected to increase their phase locking to f<sub>0</sub>, as observed. This increase in phase-locking to f<sub>0</sub> may have confounded their perception. In old gerbils, the frequency selectivity of AN fibers is not significantly affected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Heeringa et al. 2020</xref>, Hellstrom and Schmied 1996), unlike that in noise-induced hearing loss which can cause additional changes to temporal coding. Chinchillas with noise-induced hearing loss showed compromised temporal coding in response to TFS1 stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Kale et al. 2013</xref>), which is explained by a mismatch between the AN fiber’s characteristic frequency and the frequency of the stimulus component. In AN fibers from noise-damaged animals, this mismatch arises as the consequence of changes to their frequency tuning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Henry et al. 2019</xref>). In chinchillas treated with furosemide, a drug that reversibly reduces the endocochlear potential, the AN fibers’ frequency tuning curves remained unaffected, whereas their sensitivity is decreased (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Henry et al., 2019</xref>). The same can be seen in aged gerbils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Heeringa et al. 2020</xref>, Hellstrom and Schmied 1996), and, thus, a distorted tonotopy caused by changed frequency tuning is unlikely.</p>
<p>Second, age-related changes in GABAergic processing in the central auditory system have been found (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Caspary et al. 1995</xref>), including the gerbil (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Gleich et al. 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Kessler et al. 2020</xref>) and shown to affect temporal processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Gleich et al. 2003</xref>). The gerbils used by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Kessler and colleagues (2020)</xref> were derived from the same population as the gerbils used for the present study and had the same age range for old animals. Therefore, it can be assumed that the gerbils in the current study showed a change in GABAergic processing in the brain that could affect processing of such supra-threshold stimuli as being used in the TFS1 test.</p>

<sec id="s4">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>We demonstrated that the gerbils’ ability to discriminate TFS1 stimuli is neither affected by synapse loss nor by alterations to TFS representation by their AN fibers. However, the elevated neural response thresholds in old gerbils enhanced the neural envelope representation. This enhancement may have overridden the still intact TFS representation.</p>

<p>Sixty adult, agouti-colored Mongolian gerbils (<italic>Meriones unguiculatus</italic>) of both sexes (32 M, 28 F) were studied (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The gerbils originated from Charles River Laboratories and were bred in an in-house facility of the University of Oldenburg. Groups of gerbils were tested, differing in age and ouabain treatment: untreated young-adult, surgery-only young-adult, ouabain-treated young-adult, and old gerbils. Young-adult gerbils were between 3 and 19 months of age and old gerbils were 36 months or older. All animals were housed individually or in pairs in Type IV cages, which were provided with nesting material. During behavioral testing, access to water was not limited, but animals were food-deprived, such that the weight of young-adult and old gerbils was 65 - 75 g and 70 - 85 g, respectively, to motivate the animals to perform for a food reward. All protocols and procedures were approved by the Niedersӓchsisches Landesamt für Verbraucherschutz und Lebensmittelsicherheit (LAVES), Germany, permit AZ 33.19-42502-04-15/1990. All procedures were performed in compliance with the NIH Guide on Methods and Welfare Consideration in Behavioral Research with Animals (National Institute of Mental Health, 2002).</p>
<p>Young-adult gerbils were on average 10.3 ± 5.7 months of age (N = 21) and old gerbils were 38.4 ± 2.5 months old (N = 17) when electrophysiological recordings were conducted and cochleae were harvested. Treated young-adult gerbils were either 15.1 ± 3.6 (treated with a low concentration of ouabain, N = 8) or 12.7 ± 4.2 (high concentration of ouabain, N = 10). All surgery-only gerbils were 18 months old (N = 4). Gerbil groups had significantly different ages (univariate ANOVA: F=99.343; p &lt; 0.0005). Bonferroni corrected post-hoc tests revealed that old gerbils were significantly different from all other young-adult gerbil groups with respect to age, while all young-adult gerbil groups, irrespective of treatment, did not differ.</p>

<title>Stimulus paradigm</title>
<p>The stimuli were similar to those used for the TFS1 test in humans (for a detailed description see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Moore and Sek 2009</xref>). In short, the reference stimulus was a harmonic tone (H) complex. The test stimulus that was discriminated from the reference by the gerbils in the behavioral tests or by analyses of AN-fiber responses was an inharmonic tone (I) complex created by shifting all frequency components upwards. This procedure creates H and I complexes with the same envelope periodicity. In the following, the frequency shift, Δf, will be expressed by the percentage of the fundamental frequency, f<sub>0</sub> (Weber fraction).</p>
<p>The f<sub>0</sub> was either 200 or 400 Hz. H and I complexes were generated with components from f<sub>0</sub> up to 9 kHz. H and I complexes were passed through the same 3<sup>rd</sup>- or 5<sup>th</sup>-order Butterworth infinite-impulse-response band-pass filter (for AN recording and behavioral experiments, respectively), with a center frequency, fc, of 1600 or 3200 Hz, to reduce possible cues related to differences in the excitation pattern on the basilar membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Moore and Moore 2003</xref>). The 3-dB down points of the filter were separated by 7 f<sub>0</sub>, which resulted in a flat spectral region of 5 f<sub>0</sub>. The amplitude at the filter skirts decreased by at least 30 dB per octave (except for the 3<sup>rd</sup>-order filter with fc of 1600 Hz and f<sub>0</sub> of 400 Hz, for which the slope was 18 dB/oct).</p>
<p>The phase of each harmonic was randomly chosen for each test trial, but was matched for the H and I complexes within a trial to ensure similar envelopes for both stimuli (see <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> A-D). A pink noise with frequencies between 100 and 11,050 Hz was added to the signal to mask distortion products possibly emerging in the inner ear, and signal components outside the filter passband. The masker level was 20 dB SPL at 1 kHz, to mask distortion products of H and I stimuli in the gerbil (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Faulstich and Kössl, 1999</xref>). The level of each component in the tone complex was 60 dB SPL resulting in an overall level of 68 dB SPL. The duration of each H or I complex stimulus was 0.4 s. In the behavioral experiment, stimulus onset and offset were ramped with a 25-ms Hann window. Stimuli presented to AN fibers were not ramped but still filtered. By analyzing the steady-state response only, any on- and offset effects were excluded.</p>
<p>In both the behavioral experiments and in AN-fiber recordings, three combinations of f<sub>0</sub> and fc were used: fc = 1600 Hz, and f<sub>0</sub> = 200 Hz; fc = 1600 Hz, and f<sub>0</sub> = 400 Hz, and fc = 3200 Hz and f<sub>0</sub> = 400 Hz. The combination of f<sub>0</sub> = 200 Hz and fc = 3200 Hz was not used because a pilot behavioral test showed that two young untreated gerbils were not able to discriminate I and H even for the largest value of Δf.</p>
<p>The harmonic rank, N, of a condition describes the rank of the center frequency in the harmonic tone complex. The highest value for Δf was 42.5% of the fundamental f<sub>0</sub>. Lower values for Δf were computed by dividing 42.5% by 2n, with n being 1 or increasing integers. The smallest Δf presented in the behavioral tests was 0.33% f<sub>0</sub>. In old gerbils tested behaviorally, additional test stimuli with Δf = 31.87% f<sub>0</sub> and 15.94% f<sub>0</sub> were presented to ensure that old gerbils were presented with a sufficient number of trials allowing a salient percept for discrimination.</p>
<p>In recordings from gerbil AN fibers, only subsets of the stimuli used in behavior were presented to save time and minimize the number of incomplete datasets due to deterioration or loss of single-unit isolation. The frequency shifts were further grouped into either “high” (10.6, 15.9, 21.25, 31.8, and 42.5 Hz) or “low” (0.66, 1.3, and 5.31 Hz) and the stimuli were presented in three different blocks per stimulus condition. The first block comprised the H and two I complex stimuli, one with a high and one with a low shift. The second block comprised I complex stimuli, two high shifts and another low shift. The third block always comprised the remaining shifts (1.3, 10.6, and 42.5 Hz). The order of stimuli within the blocks was random between fibers. A silent period of 0.6 s occurred between stimuli. This organization of stimuli ensured that the H complex was always presented and could be compared to one low and one high shift. The second and third block of stimuli were recorded with declining success.</p>
<p>The periodic envelopes of H and I complexes created in the way described above are similar and offer no cues for discrimination, whereas the TFS of H and I complexes is not identical (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8A-D</xref>). The TFS of I complexes changes across sequential periods while the TFS of the H complex does not; only this difference can be used for discrimination. The small random change in the TFS and envelope of both H and I due to the addition of pink noise offers no discrimination cues. The bandpass filtering of the tone complexes served to minimize cochlear excitation pattern cues.</p>

<title>Experimentally introduced synaptopathy using ouabain</title>
<p>For experiments including ouabain treatment, gerbils were anesthetized with ketamine (Ketamin 10%, bela-pharm GmbH, Vechta, Germany; 135 mg/kg body weight) and xylazine (Xylazin 2%, Ceva Tiergesundheit GmbH, Düsseldorf, Germany; 6 mg/kg body weight) mixed with 0.9% saline injected intra-peritoneal. Maintenance doses of one third of the initial dose were given hourly or as needed. Depth of anesthesia was monitored by withdrawal reflex to toe pinches and via an ECG with needle electrodes in the front- and contralateral hind leg, continuously displayed on an oscilloscope (SDS 1102CNL, SIGLENT Technologies, Hamburg, Germany). Body temperature was continuously controlled with a homeothermic blanket (Harvard Apparatus, Holliston, MA, USA). Experiments were carried out in a sound-attenuating booth. The gerbil’s head was fixed within a bite-bar (David Kopf Instruments, Tujunga, CA, USA). Pure, moisturized oxygen (1.5 l/min) was delivered from a tube pointing towards the nose.</p>
<p>Twenty-two gerbils (11M, 11F, aged 3 – 8 months at the beginning of treatment) received either ouabain or artificial perilymph solution. Twenty-four hours before the oubain or artificial perilymph injection, gerbils were treated with antibiotics (oral; Baytril (0.5%, Bayer Animal Health GmbH, Monheim am Rhein, Germany; 0.3 ml per gerbil/day) and a non-steroidal antiphlogistic/ analgetic agent (oral; Meloxidyl (0.5 mg/ml, CevaTiergesundheit GmbH; 0.3 ml per gerbil/day; or Novalgin; oral; 500 mg/ml, Sanofi-Aventis Deutschland GmbH, Frankfurt, Germany, 0.21 ml per gerbil/day). The antibiotic treatment was continued for nine more days, the antiphlogistic/ analgetic agent for at least three days. Additionally, gerbils received an antiemetic (oral; Emeprid, Ceva Tiergesundheit GmbH; 0.21 ml per gerbil/day) and, if needed, also sterofundin (4 ml s.c.; B. Braun SE, Melsungen, Germany) or amynin (4 ml s.c.; Boehringer Ingelheim Pharma GmbH Co KG, Ingelheim am Rhein, Germany) as infusion solutions if gerbils were dehydrated, all post-operatively.</p>
<p>Ouabain treatment was carried out according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Bourien et al. (2014)</xref>. After gerbils were anesthetized, they received a sub-cutaneous infusion with sterofundin (4 ml). The location where the headholder met the skin of the face, was treated with 2% xylocaine ointment (Lidocainhydrochloride, Aspen Pharma Trading Limited, Dublin, Ireland). The skin covering the bulla was disinfected with 70% ethanol. A small incision was placed behind the ear to access the bulla. A hole was drilled into the bone with an angled blade and subsequently widened with forceps to reach the round window. A syringe needle tip was placed onto the round window to apply one of the following solutions onto the round window membrane: Eight gerbils were treated with 40 µM ouabain (Ouabain octahydrate, Sigma-Aldrich, Saint Louis, MO, USA), ten with 70 µM ouabain, dissolved in artificial perilymph solution (137 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 2 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MgCl2, 1 mM NaHCO3, and 11 mM glucose; pH 7.4). Four gerbils received only artificial perilymph solution (surgery-only treatment). In 15 gerbils, the solution was continuously delivered by a pump (150 µl for 30 Min). In seven gerbils, the round window niche was bathed with the solution by manually operating the syringe and after ten minutes, the solution was aspirated and reapplied. This procedure was repeated three times. Surgery was concluded by suturing the skin incision over the open, middle ear. Gerbils were binaurally treated (n = 19), except those that were destined for electrophysiology only, which were monaurally treated (n = 3).</p>
<p>Note that the experimenter conducting the electrophysiology and histology was blinded to the type of treatment: the solution that was transferred to the round window was aliquoted by another person. Only after the synapse counts were completed, the treatment was revealed.</p>

<title>Immunohistochemistry</title>
<p>Processing of cochleae was carried out as described in detail in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Steenken et al. (2022)</xref>. After concluding the single-unit recordings, gerbils were euthanized with an overdose of pentobarbital (i.p.; Narcoren, Merial GmbH, Hallbergmoos, Germany, 480 mg/kg body weigh). Twenty gerbils were cardiovascularly perfused with a mixture of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; 137 mM NaCl, 10 mM phosphate and 2.7 mM KCl, pH 7.4) followed by 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS. To prevent blood coagulation, in 15 of these gerbils, heparin (ratiopharm, 25,000 IE/5 ml; 0.2 ml/100 ml) was added to PBS. In 34 gerbils, the bulla was rapidly exposed after euthanasia and small openings were carefully created at the apex and base of the bony cochlear walls. Cochleae were then fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for two days on a shaker at 8 °C. After fixation, all cochleae were decalcified using 0.5 M ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid for two days. Subsequently, cochleae were treated with 1% Triton X-100-PBS for 1 hour to permeabilize the tissue and were then rinsed with 0.2% Triton X-100-PBS. To block unspecific binding sites, cochleae were then incubated in 3% bovine serum albumin (BSA, + 0.2% Triton X-100-PBS) blocking solution for 1 hour at room temperature.</p>
<p>Antibodies to label hair cells (anti-MyosinVIIa, IgG polyclonal rabbit; Proteus Biosciences, Ramona, CA, USA; diluted 1:400), presynaptic ribbons (anti-CtBP2 (C-terminal binding protein) antibody, IgG1 monoclonal mouse; BD Biosciences, Eysins, Switzerland; diluted 1:400), and postsynapstic receptor patches (anti-GluR2a antibody, IgG2a monoclonal mouse; Millipore, Burlington, MA, USA; diluted 1:200) in blocking solution were used. Cochleae were incubated in this mixture at 37 °C overnight. Next, cochleae were again rinsed in 0.2% Triton X-100-PBS.</p>
<p>Secondary antibodies were chosen to match the hosts of the primary antibodies: goat anti-mouse (IgG1)-AF488 (Molecular Probes Inc., Eugene, OR, USA; diluted 1:1000), goat anti-mouse (IgG2a)-AF568 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA; diluted 1:500), and donkey anti-rabbit (IgG)-AF647 (Molecular Probes Inc.; diluted 1:1000). Secondary antibodies were diluted in blocking solution and cochleae were incubated in this solution at 37 °C overnight, and subsequently rinsed in PBS.</p>
<p>After the immunostaining, a subset of the cochleae from untreated animals older than 12 months received treatment with an auto-fluorescence quencher (n = 13; TrueBlack Lipofuscin Autofluorescence Quencher, 20x in DMF, Biotum, Hayward, CA, USA). These cochleae were cut in half and incubated in a 5% true black-70% ethanol-mixture for 1 minute and then rinsed in PBS. Finally, all cochleae were micro-dissected under a stereomicroscope and the resulting 5 - 11 organ-of-Corti pieces were mounted on slides using Vectashield Mounting Medium (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA, H-1000).</p>

<title>Image acquisition</title>
<p>Overview images of cochlear pieces were acquired with a light microsope (Nikon 90i with NIS Elements software, Version 4.30, Nikon, Minato, Tokio, Japan) using a 4x objective. After measuring the length of the cochlea as a line along the row of inner hair cells with the NIS software, the cochlear location at 3.8 mm from the apex, corresponding to 2 kHz (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Müller, 1996</xref>), was chosen, because 2 kHz was part of all stimulus conditions (data for additional locations corresponding to 4, 8, and 16 kHz are provided in the Supplemental Materials). Images were taken at this position with a confocal microscope (Leica Microsystem CMS GmbH, Wetzlar, Germany, Leica TCS SP8 system) using an oil-immersion objective (40x, numerical aperture 1.3). Lasers (488-nm and 522-nm optically pumped semiconductor laser), or a 638-nm diode, respectively, excited the different fluorescence tags, and released photons were counted with a hybrid detector. Image stacks had voxel dimensions of 0.05 - 0.0998 µm (XY) and 0.3 µm (Z). All confocal stacks were deconvolved (Huygens Essentials, Version 15.10, SVI, Hilversum, Netherlands) with default settings (maximum iteration: 80; signal to noise ratio: 10; quality threshold: 0.01), using a theoretical point-spread function.</p>
<p>Synapses were counted using ImageJ (FIJI, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Schindelin et al. 2012</xref>). For each cochlear position, the number of functional synapses was evaluated for 5 inner hair cells by manually counting the co-localized ribbons and glutamate patches. Contrast and brightness were manually adjusted for each stack.</p>

<title>ABR recordings</title>
<p>Hearing sensitivity of all gerbils was evaluated prior to and during AN recordings using ABRs. The recording electrode was placed near the ipsilateral mastoid, the reference electrode was placed in the neck, and a ground electrode was placed on one hindleg. The stimulus presentation was controlled via a custom-written MATLAB software (Mathworks, Natick, MA, USA) and delivered through a RME Hammerfall DSP Multiface II sound card (RME Audio, Haimhausen, Germany). The stimuli were amplified (HB7, TDT Inc.) and presented to the gerbil’s ear via earphones (IE 800, Sennheiser, Wedemark, Germany) attached to an ear-bar. ABRs were amplified (x10^3) and band-pass filtered (0.3 - 3 kHz) using an ISO-80 pre-amplifier (World Precision Instruments, Sarasota, FL, USA), and sampled using the digital signal processor (Hammerfall DSP Multiface II, RME Audio; 48 kHz sampling rate) controlled by custom MATLAB software (Mathworks, Natick, MA, USA).</p>
<p>Prior to AN recordings, responses to chirps were recorded at a range of levels, from below threshold up to 20 dB above threshold in steps of 5 dB, repeated 300 times. Thresholds from averaged ABR waveforms were detected visually during the experiment. During single-unit recording sessions, ABR thresholds were re-checked periodically, and the experiment was terminated if threshold deteriorated by more than 30 dB.</p>

<p>Stimuli for single-unit recordings were generated with custom-written MATLAB-scripts controlling a digital signal processor (RX6, TDT Inc., Alachua, FL, USA) and an attenuator (PA5, TDT Inc.).The signal was then routed through a headphone buffer (HB7, TDT Inc.) and presented via earphones (IE 800, Sennheiser, Wedemark, Germany) attached to an ear-bar. Stimuli were calibrated at the start of each experiment using a probe-tube microphone (ER7-C, Etymotic Research Inc., Elk Grove Village, IL, USA) attached to the ear-bar and a microphone amplifier (MA3, TDT Inc., 40 dB amplification).</p>

<title>Single-unit recordings</title>
<p>Single-unit data was obtained in 22 gerbils (see <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). After the gerbil was anesthetized, a single dose of non-steroidal antiphlogistic agent (meloxicam, 0.2 mg/kg, Boehringer Ingelheim Pharma GmbH Co KG) was administered subcutaneously. The head of the gerbil was oriented with a bite bar and firmly fixed to the setup via a screw glued with dental cement to the exposed skull. The pinna of one ear was removed to place an ear-bar directly at the bony edge of the ear canal. The ear-bar was sealed with petroleum jelly to the bone to form a closed sound system. To prevent pressure buildup in the middle ear, a small hole was drilled into the dorsal bulla with an angled blade.</p>
<p>The AN was accessed via a dorsal approach. The skin covering the occipital bone and the bone itself were removed and the lateral part of the cerebellum was aspirated. The brainstem was left intact and was gently pushed medially using tiny saline soaked cotton balls to access the proximal part of the eighth cranial nerve. A glass electrode (GB120F-10, Science Products GmbH, Hofheim am Taunus, Germany; pulled using a P-2000, Sutter Instruments Co., Novato, CA, USA), filled with 3 M KCl-solution and with a resistance of ∼10 - 30 MΩ, was placed above the AN under visual control. The electrode was advanced through the AN via a remote-controlled piezo motor (Burleigh 6000 ULN inchworm motor controller and 6005 ULN handset, Burleigh, Inc., Fishers, NY, USA). Recordings were amplified (WPI 767, World Precision Instruments Inc., Sarasota, FL, USA), filtered for line-frequency noise (50 Hz, Hum Bug, Quest Scientific Instruments Inc., North Vancouver, BC, Canada), and digitized (sampling rate: 48828 Hz; RX6, TDT Inc., Alachua, FL, USA). Additionally, the analog signal was guided to an audio monitor (MS2, TDT Inc.) and displayed on an oscilloscope (SDS 1102CNL, SIGLENT Technologies, Hamburg, Germany).</p>
<p>Search stimuli (broadband noise, 1 - 9 kHz at 50 dB SPL) were played while the electrode was advanced into the AN. When a unit was isolated, its frequency response range was first assessed audio-visually using 50-ms duration tones. Next, the best frequency (BF) of each fiber was assessed by presenting pure tone bursts (50-ms duration, including 5-ms raised-cosine rise/fall times, 0 - 30 dB above threshold, 3 repetitions) at a range of frequencies within approximately ±1 octave around the audio-visually determined best response frequency. Subsequently, tone bursts at BF were presented over a range of levels (10 - 79 dB SPL, 50-ms duration including 5-ms raised-cosine rise/fall times, 10 repetitions) to derive a rate-level function. At randomly inserted trials, no stimulus was presented to determine the spontaneous rate (SR). Subsequently, TFS1 stimuli were presented at a fixed level of 60 dB SPL.</p>
<p>Spike detection from the recorded signal was conducted off-line with a custom-written MATLAB script (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Steenken et al., 2022</xref>b). In short, the bandpass-filtered (300 – 3000 Hz) recordings were manually screened for threshold-crossing events. The threshold could be adjusted on a trial-by-trial basis, to compensate for variations in spike amplitude. The time of each spike’s peak amplitude was saved as the spike time. Spike trains were excluded if: 1.) more than 10% of the spikes for a given stimulus condition were judged to be below the set threshold criterion, or 2.) any inter-spike intervals &lt; 0.6 ms occurred, indicating inadequate unit isolation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Heil et al. 2007</xref>), or 3.) a pre-potential was present in the spike waveform, suggesting a recording from the ventral cochlear nucleus (Keine and Rubsamen 2015), or 4.) the rate-level function was non-monotonic, also suggesting a potential cochlear nucleus recording (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Davis et al. 1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Joris et al. 1994</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Sinex et al. 2001</xref>).</p>

<title>Neural recordings - Data Analysis</title>
<p>A number of measures were derived from the AN spike times: a) Peri-stimulus time histograms (PSTHs), b) rate histograms, and c) vector strengths (VS) corresponding to certain periodicities in the stimuli. Only the 375-ms long steady-state part of the responses, excluding a 12.5 ms onset and offset fringe, respectively, was analyzed.</p>
<p>First, peri-stimulus time histograms (PSTHs) were calculated for each animal/fiber/condition/Δf combination, pooling over repeated stimulus presentations within each combination. Spike times were collected into histograms using bin widths of 1/10 of the f<sub>0</sub> period (0.5 ms for 200 Hz and 0.25 ms for 400 Hz). The histogram counts were converted into instantaneous spike rates by dividing by the bin width and by the number of stimulus repetitions.</p>
<p>Second, average rate and SR histograms were calculated for each group/condition/Δf combination, pooling over repeated stimulus presentations, animals, and fibers within each combination. Average rates were computed over the 375-ms steady-state portion of the response. SR was calculated from trials without stimulation. Driven rate was calculated as the difference between stimulated absolute rate and SR. Average driven rates and SRs were collected into histograms using bin widths of 2.5 spikes per second and 5 spikes per second, respectively. The average-driven-rate histogram counts were divided by the number of spike trains to convert the counts to relative frequency and smoothed with a moving-average window of 3 bin lengths.</p>
<p>Third, VS frequency spectra were calculated for each group/condition/Δf combination, pooling over repeated stimulus presentations, animals, and fibers within each combination. For this, all-order inter-spike intervals (ISIs) were calculated from each spike train, and collected into histograms using a bin width of 50 µs, corresponding to a sampling rate of 20 kHz. The bin positions ranged from −375 ms to +375 ms. A zero-centered gaussian window with a standard deviation of 200 ms was multiplied with the histogram to suppress fringe effects and spurious side lobes in the spectra. The histogram counts were divided by the total number of ISIs. A subsequent fast Fourier transform of the histograms resulted in the ISI power spectrum, and the square root of the spectral magnitudes was identical to the VS at each bin center frequency. The spectral resolution was 1.33 Hz.</p>
<p>VS single-peak data was calculated for each animal/fiber/condition/Δf combination, pooling over repeated stimulus presentations within each combination. In contrast to the spectra, the peak VS values were calculated individually for each relevant frequency <italic>f</italic>:
<disp-formula>

</disp-formula>
where <italic>t<sub>i</sub></italic> are the spike times, and N is the number of spikes in each spike train. For significance analysis of the VS, the Rayleigh statistic <italic>z</italic> (henceforth referred to as <italic>z</italic>-value) was calculated: <italic>z</italic> = <italic>N</italic><sub><italic>avg</italic></sub> · <italic>V</italic><sub><italic>avg</italic></sub><sup>2</sup> (<italic>f</italic>), where <italic>N<sub>avg</sub></italic> is the average number of spikes per spike train and <italic>V<sub>avg</sub></italic> is the average VS across stimulus presentations. The Rayleigh z statistic has useful properties for statistical analyses because VS values resulting from higher numbers of spikes have larger weights, and logarithms of ratios of z-values are approximately normally distributed, as opposed to VS ratios or differences.</p>
<p>As a metric for TFS representation, the log ratio between two z-values was derived: First, from responses to the H complex, the z-value, z<sub>0</sub>, at the frequency component that the fibers on average responded to maximally, f<sub>maxpeak</sub>, was obtained. Second, this value was divided by the z-value, z<sub>Δf</sub>, at the shifted frequency of the I complex, also in the maximal average response range (filled circles in <xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9</xref>). This ratio was used as the dependent variable in the first ANOVA model and reflects high temporal resolution; large positive values correspond to stronger phase-locked responses to the TFS of the stimulus. This metric was termed the TFS log-z-ratio.</p>

</fig>
<p>Another log ratio between z-values was used as a metric for the balance between envelope and TFS representation (crosses in <xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9</xref>): The (harmonic, unshifted) z<sub>0</sub> value at the fundamental frequency, f<sub>0</sub>, was divided by the (inharmonic, shifted) z<sub>Δf</sub> value in the maximal average response range, f<sub>maxpeak</sub>. Large positive log ratios indicate a stronger response to the stimulus envelope, whereas large negative log ratios indicate a stronger response to the stimulus TFS. This metric was termed ENV/TFS log-z-ratio.</p>
<p>The representation of Δf shift in the responses was also tested by calculating z-values at the different harmonic frequencies, combined with all possible Δf shifts.. The actual position of the maximum z-value in terms of Δf and the corresponding z-value is summarized in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> for two TFS peak frequencies (to which the Δf shifts were added): at <italic>f<sub>0</sub></italic> of the corresponding condition and at 1 kHz for the 200/1600 Hz condition, at 800 Hz for the 400/1600 Hz condition, and at 2 kHz for the 400/3200 Hz condition, respectively. The latter TFS peak frequencies were identified as the harmonics actually present in the acoustic stimulus, which had the maximum z-value in the summarized spectra (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>).</p>
<p>For the single-unit data, several main factors were defined. The low-SR fiber class comprised fibers with SR ≤ 18 spikes/s, and the high-SR class comprised fibers with SR &gt; 18 spikes/s. In addition, fibers in the low-BF class had BF ≤ 1850 Hz, and fibers in the high-BF class had BF &gt; 1850 Hz.</p>

<title>Behavioral procedure</title>
<p>The behavioral experiments were conducted in a single-walled sound-attenuating chamber (Industrial Acoustics, Type 401 A, Industrial Acoustic Company GmbH, Mönchengladbach, Germany) lined with a 15-cm thick layer of sound-absorbing foam (Pinta Acoustics Pyramide 100/50 on Pinta Acustics PLANO Type 50/0, Seyboth &amp; Co., Regensburg, Germany). The walls and all devices within the chamber produced no relevant sound reflections. The time for the reverberation in the chamber to decay by 60 dB was 12 ms, indicating nearly anechoic conditions. These conditions allowed faithful presentation of the TFS1 stimuli with the desired acoustic cues in the free sound field.</p>
<p>In the center of the chamber, a 30-cm-long wire-mesh platform was located at 90-cm height, with an elevated pedestal at its center where the gerbils waited during the measurement. This construction minimized sound reflections. At one end of the platform, a food bowl was located, attached via a tube to a custom-made feeder that did not obstruct the sound path. Gerbils were rewarded for correct discrimination with a 10-mg custom-made food pellet (Altromin International, type 1324 rodent pellets enriched with sunflower oil and spelt flour; Altromin Spezialfutter GmbH &amp; Co. KG, Lage, Germany). A loudspeaker (Canton Plus XS, frequency range: 150 Hz - 21 kHz, Canton, Weilrod, Germany) was mounted 30 cm in front of the pedestal to the side of the food bowl, at 0° elevation and azimuth relative to the gerbil’s normal head position when sitting on the pedestal. Out of the gerbil’s reach, a system of two custom-made light barriers was installed to detect the gerbil’s position and facing direction on the pedestal. An infrared camera (Conrad 150001 C-MOS camera module, Conrad Electronics, Hirschau, Germany) was positioned above the platform to observe the gerbil’s movements on the platform under invisible infrared light. The stimulus presentation, registration of light barriers switching, and feeder were controlled by custom-written software on a Linux-based PC with an RME sound-card (Hammerfall DSP Multiface II, sampling frequency 48 kHz). The signal output from the sound card was manually attenuated (Texio type RA-902A, TEXIO Technology Corporation, Kanagawa, Japan), amplified (Rotel type RMB 1506, Rotel Tokyo, Japan), and presented by the loudspeaker. Before testing started on each day, the system was calibrated (±1 dB) with a sound level meter (Brüel and Kjaer type 2238 Mediator, Hottinger Brüel &amp; Kjær, Virum, Denmark) positioned on the elevated pedestal at about the position of the gerbil’s head.</p>
<p>The behavioral experiment used an operant Go/NoGo paradigm. Gerbils were trained to wait on the pedestal facing in the direction of the loudspeaker. During the whole session, the H complex was played every 1.3 s as a reference stimulus. As soon as the gerbil jumped onto the pedestal facing the loudspeaker, a trial was started with a random waiting time between 2 and 7 s. When the waiting time had elapsed, a target stimulus, the I complex, was played instead of the reference H complex. The target stimuli could either be equal to the reference H complex (sham trial) for estimating the false-alarm rate or an I complex (test trial) for testing discrimination ability. Leaving the pedestal before the waiting time elapsed resulted in the restart of the trial with a new waiting time. Leaving the pedestal within 1.3 s after the onset of the target stimulus of a test trial, as indicated by the light barriers, was registered as a “hit” and resulted in a food reward. Staying on the pedestal in a test trial was counted as a “miss” with no food reward. The animal had to leave the pedestal and jump back onto it in the correct sequence to start a new trial after a “miss” occurred. Leaving the pedestal within 1.3 s after the start of the target stimulus in a sham trial was registered as a “false alarm”, while staying on the pedestal during a sham trial was registered as a “correct rejection”. No food reward was provided in sham trials. To keep the gerbils motivated during the session, a salient test trial not included in the analysis was inserted after each correct rejection.</p>
<p>Each session contained 10 blocks with 9 trials each (six test trials, three sham trials). All stimuli within a given block were from the same condition (200/1600 Hz, 400/1600 Hz, or 400/3200 Hz). The first block of a session was a warmup block with Δf = 42.5% that was not included in the analysis. To interleave simple and more difficult conditions, blocks of the different conditions were pseudo-randomly distributed throughout the session. The least salient condition (200/1600 Hz) did not occur within two consecutive blocks. Additionally, the sham and test trials within each block were pseudo-randomly distributed with the constraint that no sham trials followed one another within and across blocks. Data collection started when the gerbil achieved a false alarm rate below 20% in three consecutive sessions with hit rates for the three highest Δf values that would allow determining a discrimination threshold.</p>
<p>Sessions were included in the analysis if the gerbil completed all 90 trials and the false alarm rate did not exceed 20%. Data collection continued until the sample size for each condition and Δf value was at least 20 trials. The sensitivity for each Δf value was defined by applying the z-transform, <italic>d’</italic> = z(hit rate) - z(false-alarm rate). Individual discrimination thresholds for each animal and condition were then calculated from sensitivity, <italic>d’</italic>, as a function of inharmonic frequency shift, Δf%. A threshold at <italic>d’</italic> = 1 was obtained by linearly interpolating between the first Δf% shift where <italic>d’</italic> &gt; 1 and the previous Δf% shift with <italic>d’</italic> &lt;= 1. If all <italic>d’</italic> values were below 1, a linear fit was estimated through all <italic>d’</italic> values as a function of Δf% shifts and threshold was extrapolated at <italic>d’</italic> = 1. If all <italic>d’</italic> values were larger than 1, the threshold was set to half of the minimal Δf% shift measured in the specific experiment. If none of the above was possible and either all <italic>d’</italic> &lt; 1, the fitted slope was not positive, or the extrapolated threshold larger than 100% shift (equivalent to Δf = <italic>f<sub>0</sub></italic> at threshold), the final threshold was limited to 100% (5 out of 72 thresholds).</p>

<p>This study tested the specific hypothesis that age-related changes to hearing involve a partial loss of synapse connections between sensory cells in the ear and the nerve fibers that carry information about sounds to the brain, and that this interferes with the ability to discriminate rapid temporal fluctuations in sounds. Physiological, behavioral, and histological analyses provide a powerful combination to test this hypothesis in gerbils. Contrary to previous suggestions, it was found that chemically-induced isolated synaptopathy (at similar levels as observed in aged gerbils) did not result in worse performance on a behavioral task measuring sensitivity to fine-structure. Further, altered neural coding of rapid fluctuations produced no perceptual deficits in either these gerbils or in aged gerbils. These findings are <bold>important</bold> for understanding age-related changes to hearing; however, the evidence provided is <bold>incomplete</bold> due to problems in interpretation and the discussion of possible confounds and/or limitations of these data that currently limits mechanistic insight.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors investigate the effects of aging on auditory system performance in understanding temporal fine structure (TFS), using both behavioral assessments and physiological recordings from the auditory periphery, specifically at the level of the auditory nerve. This dual approach aims to enhance understanding of the mechanisms underlying observed behavioral outcomes. The results indicate that aged animals exhibit deficits in behavioral tasks for distinguishing between harmonic and inharmonic sounds, which is a standard test for TFS coding. However, neural responses at the auditory nerve level do not show significant differences when compared to those in young, normal-hearing animals. The authors suggest that these behavioral deficits in aged animals are likely attributable to dysfunctions in the central auditory system, potentially as a consequence of aging. To further investigate this hypothesis, the study includes an animal group with selective synaptic loss between inner hair cells and auditory nerve fibers, a condition known as cochlear synaptopathy (CS). CS is a pathology associated with aging and is thought to be an early indicator of hearing impairment. Interestingly, animals with selective CS showed physiological and behavioral TFS coding similar to that of the young normal-hearing group, contrasting with the aged group's deficits. Despite histological evidence of significant synaptic loss in the CS group, the study concludes that CS does not appear to affect TFS coding, either behaviorally or physiologically.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This study addresses a critical health concern, enhancing our understanding of mechanisms underlying age-related difficulties in speech intelligibility, even when audiometric thresholds are within normal limits. A major strength of this work is the comprehensive approach, integrating behavioral assessments, auditory nerve (AN) physiology, and histology within the same animal subjects. This approach enhances understanding of the mechanisms underlying the behavioral outcomes and provides confidence in the actual occurrence of synapse loss and its effects. The study carefully manages controlled conditions by including five distinct groups: young normal-hearing animals, aged animals, animals with CS induced through low and high doses, and a sham surgery group. This careful setup strengthens the study's reliability and allows for meaningful comparisons across conditions. Overall, the manuscript is well-structured, with clear and accessible writing that facilitates comprehension of complex concepts.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The stimulus and task employed in this study are very helpful for behavioral research, and using the same stimulus setup for physiology is advantageous for mechanistic comparisons. However, I have some concerns about the limitations in auditory nerve (AN) physiology. Due to practical constraints, it is not feasible to record from a large enough population of fibers that covers a full range of best frequencies (BFs) and spontaneous rates (SRs) within each animal. This raises questions about how representative the physiological data are for understanding the mechanism in behavioral data. I am curious about the authors' interpretation of how this stimulus setup might influence results compared to methods used by Kale and Heinz (2010), who adjusted harmonic frequencies based on the characteristic frequency (CF) of recorded units. While, the harmonic frequencies in this study are fixed across all CFs, meaning that many AN fibers may not be tuned closely to the stimulus frequencies. If units are not responsive to the stimulus further clarification on detecting mistuning and phase locking to TFS effects within this setup would be valuable. Given the limited number of units per condition-sometimes as few as three for certain conditions - I wonder if CF-dependent variability might impact the results of the AN data in this study and discussing this factor can help with better understanding the results. While the use of the same stimuli for both behavioral and physiological recordings is understandable, a discussion on how this choice affects interpretation would be beneficial. In addition a 60 dB stimulus could saturate high spontaneous rate (HSR) AN fibers, influencing neural coding and phase-locking to TFS. Potentially separating SR groups, could help address these issues and improve interpretive clarity.</p>
<p>A deeper discussion on the role of fiber spontaneous rate could also enhance the study. How might considering SR groups affect AN results related to TFS coding? While some statistical measures are included in the supplement, a more detailed discussion in the main text could help in interpretation.</p>
<p>Although Figure S2 indicates no change in median SR, the high-dose treatment group lacks LSR fibers, suggesting a different distribution based on SR for different animal groups, as seen in similar studies on other species. A histogram of these results would be informative, as LSR fiber loss with CS-whether induced by ouabain in gerbils or noise in other animals-is well documented (e.g., Furman et al., 2013).</p>
<p>Although ouabain effects on gerbils have been explored in previous studies, since these data already seems to be recorded for the animal in this study, a brief description of changes in auditory brainstem response (ABR) thresholds, wave 1 amplitudes, and tuning curves for animals with cochlear synaptopathy (CS) in this study would be beneficial. This would confirm that ouabain selectively affects synapses without impacting outer hair cells (OHCs). For aged animals, since ABR measurements were taken, comparing hearing differences between normal and aged groups could provide insights into the pathologies besides CS in aged animals. Additionally, examining subject variability in treatment effects on hearing and how this correlates with behavior and physiology would yield valuable insights. If limited space maybe a brief clarification or inclusion in supplementary could be good enough.</p>
<p>Another suggestion is to discuss the potential role of MOC efferent system and effect of anesthesia in reducing efferent effects in AN recordings. This is particularly relevant for aged animals, as CS might affect LSR fibers, potentially disrupting the medial olivocochlear (MOC) efferent pathway. Anesthesia could lessen MOC activity in both young and aged animals, potentially masking efferent effects that might be present in behavioral tasks. Young gerbils with functional efferent systems might perform better behaviorally, while aged gerbils with impaired MOC function due to CS might lack this advantage. A brief discussion on this aspect could potentially enhance mechanistic insights.</p>
<p>Lastly, although synapse counts did not differ between the low-dose treatment and NH I sham groups, separating these groups rather than combining them with the sham might reveal differences in behavior or AN results, particularly regarding the significance of differences between aged/treatment groups and the young normal-hearing group.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Using a gerbil model, the authors tested the hypothesis that loss of synapses between sensory hair cells and auditory nerve fibers (which may occur due to noise exposure or aging) affects behavioral discrimination of the rapid temporal fluctuations of sounds. In contrast to previous suggestions in the literature, their results do not support this hypothesis; young animals treated with a compound that reduces the number of synapses did not show impaired discrimination compared to controls. Additionally, their results from older animals showing impaired discrimination suggest that age-related changes aside from synaptopathy are responsible for the age-related decline in discrimination.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) The rationale and hypothesis are well-motivated and clearly presented.</p>
<p>(2) The study was well conducted with strong methodology for the most part, and good experimental control. The combination of physiological and behavioral techniques is powerful and informative. Reducing synapse counts fairly directly using ouabain is a cleaner design than using noise exposure or age (as in other studies), since these latter modifiers have additional effects on auditory function.</p>
<p>(3) The study may have a considerable impact on the field. The findings could have important implications for our understanding of cochlear synaptopathy, one of the most highly researched and potentially impactful developments in hearing science in the past fifteen years.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) My main concern is that the stimuli may not have been appropriate for assessing neural temporal coding behaviorally. Human studies using the same task employed a filter center frequency that was (at least) 11 times the fundamental frequency (Marmel et al., 2015; Moore and Sek, 2009). Moore and Sek wrote: &quot;the default (recommended) value of the centre frequency is 11F0.&quot; Here, the center frequency was only 4 or 8 times the fundamental frequency (4F0 or 8F0). Hence, relative to harmonic frequency, the harmonic spacing was considerably greater in the present study. By my calculations, the masking noise used in the present study was also considerably lower in level relative to the harmonic complex than that used in the human studies. These factors may have allowed the animals to perform the task using cues based on the pattern of activity across the neural array (excitation pattern cues), rather than cues related to temporal neural coding. The authors show that mean neural driven rate did not change with frequency shift, but I don't understand the relevance of this. It is the change in response of individual fibers with characteristic frequencies near the lowest audible harmonic that is important here.</p>
<p>The case against excitation pattern cues needs to be better made in the Discussion. It could be that gerbil frequency selectivity is broad enough for this not to be an issue, but more detail needs to be provided to make this argument. The authors should consider what is the lowest audible harmonic in each case for their stimuli, given the level of each harmonic and the level of the pink noise. Even for the 8F0 center frequency, the lowest audible harmonic may be as low as the 4th (possibly even the 3rd). In human, harmonics are thought to be resolvable by the cochlea up to at least the 8th.</p>
<p>(2) The synapse reductions in the high ouabain and old groups were relatively small (mean of 19 synapses per hair cell compared to 23 in the young untreated group). In contrast, in some mouse models of the effects of noise exposure or age, a 50% reduction in synapses is observed, and in the human temporal bone study of Wu et al. (2021, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1523/JNEUROSCI.3238-20.2021">https://doi.org/10.1523/JNEUROSCI.3238-20.2021</ext-link>) the age-related reduction in auditory nerve fibres was ~50% or greater for the highest age group across cochlear location. It could be simply that the synapse loss in the present study was too small to produce significant behavioral effects. Hence, although the authors provide evidence that in the gerbil model the age-related behavioral effects are not due to synaptopathy, this may not translate to other species (including human). This should be discussed in the manuscript.</p>
<p>It would be informative to provide synapse counts separately for the animals who were tested behaviorally, to confirm that the pattern of loss across the group was the same as for the larger sample.</p>
<p>(3) The study was not pre-registered, and there was no a priori power calculation, so there is less confidence in replicability than could have been the case. Only three old animals were used in the behavioral study, which raises concerns about the reliability of comparisons involving this group.</p>

<p>This study is a part of the ongoing series of rigorous work from this group exploring neural coding deficits in the auditory nerve, and dissociating the effects of cochlear synaptopathy from other age-related deficits. They have previously shown no evidence of phase-locking deficits in the remaining auditory nerve fibers in quiet-aged gerbils. Here, they study the effects of aging on the perception and neural coding of temporal fine structure cues in the same Mongolian gerbil model.</p>
<p>They measure TFS coding in the auditory nerve using the TFS1 task which uses a combination of harmonic and tone-shifted inharmonic tones which differ primarily in their TFS cues (and not the envelope). They then follow this up with a behavioral paradigm using the TFS1 task in these gerbils. They test young normal hearing gerbils, aged gerbils, and young gerbils with cochlear synaptopathy induced using the neurotoxin ouabain to mimic synapse losses seen with age.</p>
<p>In the behavioral paradigm, they find that aging is associated with decreased performance compared to the young gerbils, whereas young gerbils with similar levels of synapse loss do not show these deficits. When looking at the auditory nerve responses, they find no differences in neural coding of TFS cues across any of the groups. However, aged gerbils show an increase in the representation of periodicity envelope cues (around f0) compared to young gerbils or those with induced synapse loss. The authors hence conclude that synapse loss by itself doesn't seem to be important for distinguishing TFS cues, and rather the behavioral deficits with age are likely having to do with the misrepresented envelope cues instead.</p>
<p>The manuscript is well written, and the data presented are robust. Some of the points below will need to be considered while interpreting the results of the study, in its current form. These considerations are addressable if deemed necessary, with some additional analysis in future versions of the manuscript.</p>
<p>Spontaneous rates - Figure S2 shows no differences in median spontaneous rates across groups. But taking the median glosses over some of the nuances there. Ouabain (in the Bourien study) famously affects low spont rates first, and at a higher degree than median or high spont rates. It seems to be the case (qualitatively) in Figure S2 as well, with almost no units in the low spont region in the ouabain group, compared to the other groups. Looking at distributions within each spont rate category and comparing differences across the groups might reveal some of the underlying causes for these changes. Given that overall, the study reports that low-SR fibers had a higher ENV/TFS log-z-ratio, the distribution of these fibers across groups may reveal specific effects of TFS coding by group.</p>
<p>Threshold shifts - It is unclear from the current version if the older gerbils have changes in hearing thresholds, and whether those changes may be affecting behavioral thresholds. The behavioral stimuli appear to have been presented at a fixed sound level for both young and aged gerbils, similar to the single unit recordings. Hence, age-related differences in behavior may have been due to changes in relative sensation level. Approaches such as using hearing thresholds as covariates in the analysis will help explore if older gerbils still show behavioral deficits.</p>
<p>Task learning in aged gerbils - It is unclear if the aged gerbils really learn the task well in two of the three TFS1 test conditions. The d' of 1 which is usually used as the criterion for learning was not reached in even the easiest condition for aged gerbils in all but one condition for the aged gerbils (Fig. 5H) and in that condition, there doesn't seem to be any age-related deficits in behavioral performance (Fig. 6B). Hence dissociating the inability to learn the task from the inability to perceive TFS 1 cues in those animals becomes challenging.</p>
<p>Increased representation of periodicity envelope in the AN - the mechanisms for increased representation of periodicity envelope cues is unclear. The authors point to some potential central mechanisms but given that these are recordings from the auditory nerve what central mechanisms these may be is unclear. If the authors are suggesting some form of efferent modulation only at the f0 frequency, no evidence for this is presented. It appears more likely that the enhancement may be due to outer hair cell dysfunction (widened tuning, distorted tonotopy). Given this increased envelope coding, the potential change in sensation level for the behavior (from the comment above), and no change in neural coding of TFS cues across any of the groups, a simpler interpretation may be -TFS coding is not affected in remaining auditory nerve fibers after age-related or ouabain induced synapse loss, but behavioral performance is affected by altered outer hair cell dysfunction with age.</p>
<p>Emerging evidence seems to suggest that cochlear synaptopathy and/or TFS encoding abilities might be reflected in listening effort rather than behavioral performance. Measuring some proxy of listening effort in these gerbils (like reaction time) to see if that has changed with synapse loss, especially in the young animals with induced synaptopathy, would make an interesting addition to explore perceptual deficits of TFS coding with synapse loss.</p>

<p>Although ouabain effects on gerbils have been explored in previous studies, since these data already seems to be recorded for the animal in this study, a brief description of changes in auditory brainstem response (ABR) thresholds, wave 1 amplitudes, and tuning curves for animals with cochlear synaptopathy (CS) in this study would be beneficial. This would confirm that ouabain selectively affects synapses without impacting outer hair cells (OHCs). For aged animals, since ABR measurements were taken, comparing hearing differences between normal and aged groups could provide insights into the pathologies besides CS in aged animals. Additionally, examining subject variability in treatment effects on hearing and how this correlates with behavior and physiology would yield valuable insights.

<p>We do indeed have data on ABR amplitudes and the wave 1 growth functions but only in response to broadband clicks. For more frequency-specific information, mass-potential recordings are available, obtained before and after ouabain treatment.

We are in the process of analyzing all these data further and will consider how to best incorporate them into the manuscript, to address the reviewer’s concerns.</p>

<p>Another suggestion is to discuss the potential role of MOC efferent system and effect of anesthesia in reducing efferent effects in AN recordings. This is particularly relevant for aged animals, as CS might affect LSR fibers, potentially disrupting the medial olivocochlear (MOC) efferent pathway. Anesthesia could lessen MOC activity in both young and aged animals, potentially masking efferent effects that might be present in behavioral tasks. Young gerbils with functional efferent systems might perform better behaviorally, while aged gerbils with impaired MOC function due to CS might lack this advantage. A brief discussion on this aspect could potentially enhance mechanistic insights.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Our provisional response below will be integrated in similar form into the Discussion.</p>
<p>Olivocochlear efferent activity is a potential modulator of OHC gain (by medial olivocochlear neurons, MOC) and afferent activity (by lateral olivocochlear neurons, LOC). Beyond this general observation it is, however, difficult to speculate about its specific role in the TFS1 test, as almost nothing is known about efferent activity under naturalistic conditions in a behaving animal (reviewed by Lauer et al., 2022). We note, however, that efferent activity is believed to be reduced under general anesthesia (reviewed by Guinan, 2011, DOI 10.1007/978-1-4419-7070-1_3) and possibly abnormal in other ways, considering the potential top-down inputs to the efferent neurons from extensive brain networks (reviewed by Schofield, 2011, DOI 10.1007/978-1-4419-7070-1_9; Romero and Trussell, 2022, DOI: 10.1016/j.heares.2022.108516). Thus, it is reasonable to assume a reduced efferent influence in our auditory-nerve data, compared to the behavioral test situation. In contrast, we assume more comparable efferent influences in young-adult and old gerbils. It was recently shown that, despite age-related losses in both MOC and LOC cochlear innervation, this basically reflected the loss of efferent target structures (OHC and type-I afferents), with the surviving cochlear circuitry remaining largely normal (Steenken et al., 2024, DOI: 10.3389/fnsyn.2024.1422330). The main difference was an increased proportion of OHC without any efferent innervation, predominantly in low-frequency cochlear regions (Steenken et al., 2024). Such OHC are thus not under efferent control, and they are more numerous (about 10 – 30%) in old gerbils.</p>
<p>Lastly, although synapse counts did not differ between the low-dose treatment and NH I sham groups, separating these groups rather than combining them with the sham might reveal differences in behavior or AN results, particularly regarding the significance of differences between aged/treatment groups and the young normal-hearing group. For maximizing statistical power, we combined those groups in the statistical analysis. These two groups did not differ in synapse number and had quite similar ABR wave 1 growth functions.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Using a gerbil model, the authors tested the hypothesis that loss of synapses between sensory hair cells and auditory nerve fibers (which may occur due to noise exposure or aging) affects behavioral discrimination of the rapid temporal fluctuations of sounds. In contrast to previous suggestions in the literature, their results do not support this hypothesis; young animals treated with a compound that reduces the number of synapses did not show impaired discrimination compared to controls. Additionally, their results from older animals showing impaired discrimination suggest that age-related changes aside from synaptopathy are responsible for the age-related decline in discrimination.</p>

<p>We agree with the reviewer’s summary.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) The rationale and hypothesis are well-motivated and clearly presented.</p>
<p>(2) The study was well conducted with strong methodology for the most part, and good experimental control. The combination of physiological and behavioral techniques is powerful and informative. Reducing synapse counts fairly directly using ouabain is a cleaner design than using noise exposure or age (as in other studies), since these latter modifiers have additional effects on auditory function.</p>
<p>(3) The study may have a considerable impact on the field. The findings could have important implications for our understanding of cochlear synaptopathy, one of the most highly researched and potentially impactful developments in hearing science in the past fifteen years.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) My main concern is that the stimuli may not have been appropriate for assessing neural temporal coding behaviorally. Human studies using the same task employed a filter center frequency that was (at least) 11 times the fundamental frequency (Marmel et al., 2015; Moore and Sek, 2009). Moore and Sek wrote: &quot;the default (recommended) value of the centre frequency is 11F0.&quot; Here, the center frequency was only 4 or 8 times the fundamental frequency (4F0 or 8F0). Hence, relative to harmonic frequency, the harmonic spacing was considerably greater in the present study. By my calculations, the masking noise used in the present study was also considerably lower in level relative to the harmonic complex than that used in the human studies. These factors may have allowed the animals to perform the task using cues based on the pattern of activity across the neural array (excitation pattern cues), rather than cues related to temporal neural coding. The authors show that mean neural driven rate did not change with frequency shift, but I don't understand the relevance of this. It is the change in response of individual fibers with characteristic frequencies near the lowest audible harmonic that is important here.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The auditory filter bandwidth of the gerbil is about double that of human subjects. Because of this, the masking noise has a larger overall level than in the human studies in the filter. This precludes that the gerbils can use excitation patterns, especially in the condition with a center frequency of 1600 Hz and a fundamental of 200 Hz and in the condition with a center frequency of 3200 Hz and a fundamental of 400 Hz.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The case against excitation pattern cues needs to be better made in the Discussion. It could be that gerbil frequency selectivity is broad enough for this not to be an issue, but more detail needs to be provided to make this argument. The authors should consider what is the lowest audible harmonic in each case for their stimuli, given the level of each harmonic and the level of the pink noise. Even for the 8F0 center frequency, the lowest audible harmonic may be as low as the 4th (possibly even the 3rd). In human, harmonics are thought to be resolvable by the cochlea up to at least the 8th.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Because of the gerbil’s broader auditory filters, with the exception of the condition with center frequency of 1600 Hz and fundamental of 400 Hz harmonics are are not resolved. We will expand the topic of potential excitation pattern cues in the discussion of the revised version and add results on modeled excitation patterns to the supplement.</p>

<p>(2) The synapse reductions in the high ouabain and old groups were relatively small (mean of 19 synapses per hair cell compared to 23 in the young untreated group). In contrast, in some mouse models of the effects of noise exposure or age, a 50% reduction in synapses is observed, and in the human temporal bone study of Wu et al. (2021, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1523/JNEUROSCI.3238-20.2021">https://doi.org/10.1523/JNEUROSCI.3238-20.2021</ext-link>) the age-related reduction in auditory nerve fibres was ~50% or greater for the highest age group across cochlear location. It could be simply that the synapse loss in the present study was too small to produce significant behavioral effects. Hence, although the authors provide evidence that in the gerbil model the age-related behavioral effects are not due to synaptopathy, this may not translate to other species (including human). This should be discussed in the manuscript.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Our provisional response below will be integrated in similar form into the Discussion.</p>
<p>The observed extent of age-related or noise-induced loss of type-I afferent synapses on IHC varies widely between species and studies. For example, in ageing CBA/CaJ mice, mean losses of between 20 and 50% of afferent synapses (depending on cochlear location and precise age) were reported (Sergeyenko et al., 2013, DOI: 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1783-13.2013; Kobrina et al., 2020, DOI: 10.1016/j.neurobiolaging.2020.08.012). Humans showed more pronounced losses of peripheral axons, of 40–100%, again depending on cochlear location, precise age, and noise history (Wu et al., 2019, DOI: 10.1016/j.neuroscience.2018.07.053; 2021, DOI: 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.3238-20.2021). The age-related and induced synapse losses in our gerbils were in a more moderate range, around 20% (Steenken et al., 2021, DOI: 10.1016/j.neurobiolaging.2021.08.019; this study). Thus, it is possible that a more severe, induced synaptopathy would have resulted in behavioral deficits in young-adult gerbils. However, in the absence of additional noise or pharmacologically induced damage, our study provides strong evidence for other factors causing temporal processing problems with advancing age. Our 3-year-old gerbils are approximately comparable to a 60-year-old human (Castano-Gonzalez et al., 2024, DOI: 10.1016/j.heares.2024.108989) with beginning but not yet clinically relevant hearing loss (Hamann et al., 2002, DOI: 10.1016/S0378-5955(02)00454-9).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>It would be informative to provide synapse counts separately for the animals who were tested behaviorally, to confirm that the pattern of loss across the group was the same as for the larger sample.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Yes, the pattern was the same for the subgroup of behaviorally tested animals. We will add this information to the revised version of the manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) The study was not pre-registered, and there was no a priori power calculation, so there is less confidence in replicability than could have been the case. Only three old animals were used in the behavioral study, which raises concerns about the reliability of comparisons involving this group.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The results for the three old subjects differed significantly from those of young subjects and young ouabain-treated subjects. This indicates a sufficient statistical power, since otherwise no significant differences would be observed.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>This study is a part of the ongoing series of rigorous work from this group exploring neural coding deficits in the auditory nerve, and dissociating the effects of cochlear synaptopathy from other age-related deficits. They have previously shown no evidence of phase-locking deficits in the remaining auditory nerve fibers in quiet-aged gerbils. Here, they study the effects of aging on the perception and neural coding of temporal fine structure cues in the same Mongolian gerbil model.</p>
<p>They measure TFS coding in the auditory nerve using the TFS1 task which uses a combination of harmonic and tone-shifted inharmonic tones which differ primarily in their TFS cues (and not the envelope). They then follow this up with a behavioral paradigm using the TFS1 task in these gerbils. They test young normal hearing gerbils, aged gerbils, and young gerbils with cochlear synaptopathy induced using the neurotoxin ouabain to mimic synapse losses seen with age. In the behavioral paradigm, they find that aging is associated with decreased performance compared to the young gerbils, whereas young gerbils with similar levels of synapse loss do not show these deficits. When looking at the auditory nerve responses, they find no differences in neural coding of TFS cues across any of the groups.</p>
<p>However, aged gerbils show an increase in the representation of periodicity envelope cues (around f0) compared to young gerbils or those with induced synapse loss. The authors hence conclude that synapse loss by itself doesn't seem to be important for distinguishing TFS cues, and rather the behavioral deficits with age are likely having to do with the misrepresented envelope cues instead.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the reviewer’s summary.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The manuscript is well written, and the data presented are robust. Some of the points below will need to be considered while interpreting the results of the study, in its current form. These considerations are addressable if deemed necessary, with some additional analysis in future versions of the manuscript.</p>
<p>Spontaneous rates - Figure S2 shows no differences in median spontaneous rates across groups. But taking the median glosses over some of the nuances there. Ouabain (in the Bourien study) famously affects low spont rates first, and at a higher degree than median or high spont rates. It seems to be the case (qualitatively) in Figure S2 as well, with almost no units in the low spont region in the ouabain group, compared to the other groups. Looking at distributions within each spont rate category and comparing differences across the groups might reveal some of the underlying causes for these changes. Given that overall, the study reports that low-SR fibers had a higher ENV/TFS log-z-ratio, the distribution of these fibers across groups may reveal specific effects of TFS coding by group.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As the reviewer points out, our sample from the group treated with a high concentration of ouabain showed very few low-spontaneous-rate auditory-nerve fibers, as expected from previous work. However, this was also true, e.g., for our sample from sham-operated animals, and may thus well reflect a sampling bias. We are therefore reluctant to attach much significance to these data distributions. We will consider moving some supplementary information back into the main manuscript when revising.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Threshold shifts - It is unclear from the current version if the older gerbils have changes in hearing thresholds, and whether those changes may be affecting behavioral thresholds. The behavioral stimuli appear to have been presented at a fixed sound level for both young and aged gerbils, similar to the single unit recordings. Hence, age-related differences in behavior may have been due to changes in relative sensation level. Approaches such as using hearing thresholds as covariates in the analysis will help explore if older gerbils still show behavioral deficits.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Unfortunately, we did not obtain behavioral thresholds that could be used here. The ABR thresholds, although not directly comparable to behavioral thresholds, suggest that our old animals had at most a moderate threshold increase in quiet. Furthermore, we want to point out that the TFS 1 stimuli had an overall level of 68 dB SPL, and the pink noise masker would have increased the threshold more than expected from the moderate, age-related hearing loss in quiet. Thus, the masked thresholds for all gerbil groups are likely similar and should have no effect on the behavioral results.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Task learning in aged gerbils - It is unclear if the aged gerbils really learn the task well in two of the three TFS1 test conditions. The d' of 1 which is usually used as the criterion for learning was not reached in even the easiest condition for aged gerbils in all but one condition for the aged gerbils (Fig. 5H) and in that condition, there doesn't seem to be any age-related deficits in behavioral performance (Fig. 6B). Hence dissociating the inability to learn the task from the inability to perceive TFS 1 cues in those animals becomes challenging.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Even in the group of gerbils with the lowest sensitivity, for the condition 400/1600 the animals achieved a d’ of on average above 1. Furthermore, stimuli were well above threshold and audible, even when no discrimination could be observed. Finally, as explained in the methods, different stimulus conditions were interleaved in each session, providing stimuli that were easy to discriminate together with those being difficult to discriminate. This approach ensures that the gerbils were under stimulus control, meaning properly trained to perform the task. Thus, an inability to discriminate does not indicate a lack of proper training.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Increased representation of periodicity envelope in the AN - the mechanisms for increased representation of periodicity envelope cues is unclear. The authors point to some potential central mechanisms but given that these are recordings from the auditory nerve what central mechanisms these may be is unclear. If the authors are suggesting some form of efferent modulation only at the f0 frequency, no evidence for this is presented. It appears more likely that the enhancement may be due to outer hair cell dysfunction (widened tuning, distorted tonotopy). Given this increased envelope coding, the potential change in sensation level for the behavior (from the comment above), and no change in neural coding of TFS cues across any of the groups, a simpler interpretation may be -TFS coding is not affected in remaining auditory nerve fibers after age-related or ouabain induced synapse loss, but behavioral performance is affected by altered outer hair cell dysfunction with age.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>A similar point is made by Reviewer #1. As indicated above, we do have limited data on neural bandwidths and will explore if these are sufficient to address the reviewers’ questions about potential, age-related changes in neural tuning in our sample. Previous work found no substantial OHC losses (Tarnowski et al., 1991, DOI: 10.1016/0378-5955(91)90142-V; Adams and Schulte, 1997, DOI: 10.1016/S0378-5955(96)00184-0; Steenken et al., 2024, DOI: 10.3389/fnsyn.2024.1422330) nor any deterioration in neural frequency tuning (Heeringa et al., 2020, DOI: 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.2784-18.2019), in quiet-aged gerbils of similar age as the ones used here.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Emerging evidence seems to suggest that cochlear synaptopathy and/or TFS encoding abilities might be reflected in listening effort rather than behavioral performance. Measuring some proxy of listening effort in these gerbils (like reaction time) to see if that has changed with synapse loss, especially in the young animals with induced synaptopathy, would make an interesting addition to explore perceptual deficits of TFS coding with synapse loss.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This is an interesting suggestion that we will explore in the revision of the manuscript. Reaction times were recorded for responses that can be used as a proxy for listening effort.</p>
