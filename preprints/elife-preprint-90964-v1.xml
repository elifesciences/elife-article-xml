<title>Abstract</title><p>Normal aging leads to myelin alternations in the rhesus monkey dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), which are often correlated with cognitive impairment. It is hypothesized that remyelination with shorter and thinner myelin sheaths partially compensates for myelin degradation, but computational modeling has not yet explored these two phenomena together systematically. Here, we used a two-pronged modeling approach to determine how age-related myelin changes affect a core cognitive function: spatial working memory. First we built a multicompartment pyramidal neuron model fit to monkey dlPFC data, with axon including myelinated segments having paranodes, juxtaparanodes, internodes, and tight junctions, to quantify conduction velocity (CV) changes and action potential (AP) failures after demyelination and subsequent remyelination in a population of neurons. Lasso regression identified distinctive parameter sets likely to modulate an axon’s susceptibility to CV changes following demyelination versus remyelination. Next we incorporated the single neuron results into a spiking neural network model of working memory. While complete remyelination nearly recovered axonal transmission and network function to unperturbed levels, our models predict that biologically plausible levels of myelin dystrophy, if uncompensated by other factors, can account for substantial working memory impairment with aging. The present computational study unites empirical data from electron microscopy up to behavior on aging, and has broader implications for many demyelinating conditions, such as multiple sclerosis or schizophrenia.</p>

<p>Normal aging often leads to cognitive impairment, as evidenced by reduced performance on learning and memory tasks in both humans (<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Albert, 1993</xref></bold>; <bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Salthouse et al., 2003</xref></bold>; <bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Fisk and Sharp, 2004</xref></bold>; <bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Rhodes, 2004</xref></bold>; <bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">Sorel and Pennequin, 2008</xref></bold>) and non-human primates (<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Moore et al., 2006</xref></bold>; <bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Shamy et al., 2011</xref></bold>; <bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Moore et al., 2017</xref></bold>; <bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Comrie et al., 2018</xref></bold>; <bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Chang et al., 2022</xref></bold>; <bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Moore et al., 2023</xref></bold>). In the rhesus monkey, age-related working memory decline is accompanied by sublethal structural and functional changes in vascular elements, individual pyramidal neurons, glial cells, and white matter pathways (<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Hof and Morrison, 2004</xref></bold>; reviews: <bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Luebke et al., 2010</xref></bold> and <bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Peters and Kemper, 2012</xref></bold>; <bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Morrison and Baxter, 2012</xref></bold>; <bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Luebke et al., 2015</xref></bold>; <bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">Shobin et al., 2017</xref></bold>; <bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Dimovasili et al., 2022</xref></bold>). It is well documented that neurons do not die during normal aging but rather undergo a number of morphological and physiological alterations, particularly in the monkey dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), the critical cortical circuit for working memory. For example, during normal aging Layer 3 pyramidal neurons in rhesus dlPFC exhibit a significant loss of dendritic spines and synapses (<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Chang et al., 2005</xref></bold>; <bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Peters et al., 2008</xref></bold>), and electrophysiological changes observed both <italic>in vitro</italic> (<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Chang et al., 2005</xref></bold>; <bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Ibañez et al., 2020</xref></bold>) and <italic>in vivo</italic> during a spatial working memory task (<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c95">Wang et al., 2011</xref></bold>). Perhaps most strikingly, extensive myelin dystrophy during normal aging has been observed in both gray and white matter (<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Peters et al., 2001</xref></bold>; review: <bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Peters, 2007</xref></bold>; <bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Bowley et al., 2010</xref></bold>), including in monkey dlPFC (<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Peters and Sethares, 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">2003</xref></bold>; review: <bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Peters, 2009</xref></bold>). Ultrastructural studies reveal that 3-6% of myelin sheaths in dlPFC exhibit age-related alterations including splitting of the major dense line of the myelin sheath, balloons, and redundant myelin (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref></bold>; <bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Peters and Sethares, 2002</xref></bold>). Remyelination has also been observed across the adult lifespan in monkey dlPFC. Electron microscopy (EM) revealed a 90% increase in the number of paranodal profiles in aged versus young monkeys, indicating higher numbers of internodal myelin sheaths with aging. Aged subjects also had a significant proportion of abnormally short and thin myelin sheaths (<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Peters and Sethares, 2003</xref></bold>). The hypothesized mechanism to explain these findings (review: <bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Peters, 2009</xref></bold>) is that myelin degradation begins as oligodendrocytes degenerate due to oxidative stress, and that axons accumulate dense inclusions in spaces between the lamellae of their associated myelin sheaths. As oligodendrocytes die, the associated sheaths detach from the axolemma, leaving bare axonal sections (complete demyelination). Subsequently, new mature oligodendrocytes remyelinate the bare segments, but with shorter and thinner sheaths. It is believed that the altered sheaths lead to a slowdown of signal propagation that contributes to cognitive impairment with aging. Several of the changes that pyramidal neurons undergo with aging correlate with observed cognitive impairment (review: <bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Luebke et al., 2010</xref></bold>; <bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Peters and Kemper, 2012</xref></bold>; <bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">Shobin et al., 2017</xref></bold>; <bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Moore et al., 2023</xref></bold>), including myelin dystrophies and remyelination (<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Peters and Sethares, 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Dimovasili et al., 2022</xref></bold>). However, which changes are the key determinants of age-related cognitive decline has not yet been firmly established (<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Konar et al., 2016</xref></bold>; <bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Motley et al., 2018</xref></bold>; <bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Cleeland et al., 2019</xref></bold>). This is in part due to the difficulty of isolating individual neuronal features (e.g., firing rate, synapses, myelin) empirically, while controlling for concomitant changes in others. Thus, computational models become essential to predict how age-related changes in individual neurons affect cognitive impairment.</p>

<p>Numerous modeling studies have examined connections between axon parameters and action potential (AP) conduction velocity (<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Rushton, 1951</xref></bold>; <bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Goldman and Albus, 1968</xref></bold>; <bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Brill et al., 1977</xref></bold>; <bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Moore et al., 1978</xref></bold>; <bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c97">Waxman, 1980</xref></bold>; <bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Chomiak and Hu, 2009</xref></bold>). Others have sought the most appropriate way to model the axon (e.g. <bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Blight, 1985</xref></bold>; <bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Richardson et al., 2000</xref></bold>; <bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">McIntyre et al., 2002</xref></bold>; <bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Gow and Devaux, 2008</xref></bold>; <bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Dekker et al., 2014</xref></bold>). Demyelination has been modeled frequently in the context of disease (review: <bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Coggan et al., 2015</xref></bold>), showing that loss of myelin leads to slower AP conduction velocity (CV) and sometimes to AP failure. Remyelination of axons with shorter, thinner internodes decreases CV in models of both large- and small-diameter axons (<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Lasiene et al., 2008</xref></bold>; <bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Powers et al., 2012</xref></bold>; <bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Scurfield and Latimer, 2018</xref></bold>). However, to our knowledge, the effects on AP propagation of widespread demyelination and remyelination in a broad population of axons has not been explored systematically. There have also been studies of how CV and myelin alterations impact network synchrony in phase oscillator models (<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Karimian et al., 2019</xref></bold>; <bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Pajevic et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Noori et al., 2020</xref></bold>; <bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Pajevic et al., 2023</xref></bold>), but not in spiking neural networks that can explain the mechanisms underlying working memory. Our recent network model found that age-related changes in firing rates and synapse numbers in individual neurons can lead to working memory impairment (<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Ibañez et al., 2020</xref></bold>), but did not consider myelin dystrophy.</p>
<p>This study unites models at two different scales – multicompartment models of dlPFC pyramidal neurons and a spiking network model simulating spatial working memory – to investigate how age-related myelin degradation (represented by demyelination) and remyelination affect signal transmission and working memory precision. Higher degrees of demyelination led to slower propagation and eventual failure of APs along the axons, resulting in working memory impairment in the network model. Sufficient remyelination led to recovery of signal transmission and working memory performance. Overall, our study indicates that observed levels of myelin changes, if uncompensated by other factors, would lead to substantial working memory impairment with aging.</p>

<title>Progressive demyelination causes CV slowing and AP failures in model neurons</title>
<p>To simulate myelin alterations in individual neurons, we adapted our multicompartment model tuned to data from rhesus monkey dlPFC (<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Rumbell et al., 2016</xref></bold>) by attaching an axon model that captured nodes and detailed myelinated segments (<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Gow and Devaux, 2008</xref></bold>; <bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Scurfield and Latimer, 2018</xref></bold>). Myelinated segments included an internode with adjacent juxtaparanodes and paranodes, and tight junctions between the innermost myelin lamella and axolemma (see Methods; <bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A-B</xref></bold>). We applied demyelination and remyelination perturbations to a cohort of 50 young (control) neuron models, with axonal parameters varying within biologically plausible ranges. The CV in control models varied across the cohort and in response to myelin alterations (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>; Supplementary Figure 1</bold>). CV changes were more sensitive to variations along some dimensions of the parameter space than to others (e.g. myelinated segment length versus axon diameter), explored further below.</p>

The paranodes, juxtaparanodes, and internodes (shown in different shades of red) were insulated by myelin lamellae, adjacent to unmyelinated nodes (dark gray). During demyelination, lamellae were removed from a subset of segments; middle cartoon shows two lamellae remaining, indicating 50% lamellae removed relative to an unperturbed myelinated segment. During remyelination, select myelinated segments were replaced with two shorter myelinated segments separated by a new node; bottom cartoon shows remyelination with 50% of lamellae restored relative to unperturbed segments. At right are shown membrane potential traces simulated at the initial segment (top, dashed line) and near the distal end of one axon (here, 1.9 cm long) in the unperturbed, demyelinated, and remyelinated cases. Traces correspond to signals in a distal node and subsequent paranode, juxtaparanode, and internode respectively (colors indicating the axonal sections as in left panels). Demyelinating 75% of segments by removing 50% of their lamellae resulted in a 70% reduction in conduction velocity, and failure of one AP. Remyelination of all affected segments with the same 50% of lamellae recovered the failed AP, and 98% of the CV delay relative to the demyelinated case (in one of the 30 simulated trials).

<p>AP propagation was increasingly impaired with increasing levels of demyelination across the control model cohort (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref></bold>): CV became slower, eventually leading to AP failure in several cases. Summarizing these results as a function of segments affected and lamellae removed made the overall trends clearer (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref></bold>). For example, irrespective of the extent of demyelination along an axon, when only 25% of lamellae were removed, CV change was negligible. However, when 100% of lamellae were removed, CV slowed drastically – by 38 ± 10 % even when just 25% of the segments were demyelinated. Under similar circumstances, when 75% of the segments were demyelinated, mean CV change was as much as -72 ± 8 %. Indeed, several axons under this condition showed AP failures, as evident from heat maps in <bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref></bold>. The percentage of high failure trials, in which at least 75% of control APs were lost, increased dramatically as demyelination increased (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref></bold>).</p>

<title>Remyelination causes partial recovery from CV slowing and AP failures</title>
<p>We next examined how remyelination, occurring after demyelination, affected axonal AP propagation in the neuron models (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref></bold>). We first assumed that affected segments had been previously completely demyelinated, i.e. losing all their lamellae (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A-C</xref></bold>). Most remyelinated models showed CV recovery from 0-100%, except for a few cases in which CV increased relative to the unperturbed models (<bold>Supplementary Figure 2</bold>; see Discussion). Regardless of the extent of initial demyelination along an axon, CV recovery increased as both the remyelination and the lamellae restoration percentages increased. When all demyelinated segments were subsequently remyelinated – so that none of the perturbed segments were bare (unmyelinated) – with sufficient myelin lamellae, conduction recovery was similar to that in the unperturbed cohort (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref></bold>). A milder dependence of CV recovery on the initial fraction of demyelination also emerged. When all demyelinated segments were remyelinated, there was a <italic>positive</italic> relationship between the initial demyelination rate and the CV recovery: CV recovered more when 75% of the segments were demyelinated (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref></bold>, black lines). This finding is plausibly explained by observations of <bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Scurfield and Latimer (2018)</xref></bold>, in which remyelinated axons with a larger number of transitions between long (unperturbed) and short (remyelinated) segments had slower CV. We saw the same relationship in our simulations (<bold>Supplementary Figure 3</bold>). When remyelination was less than 100%, there was a <italic>negative</italic> relationship between the initial amount of demyelination and CV recovery, explained by the number of bare segments that were not remyelinated. Results for the percentage of high failure trials (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref></bold>) were consistent with those for CV recovery. While the percentage of high failure trials decreased across the cohort as remyelination increased, certain models were more prone to AP failures than others, motivating the statistical analysis below. Consequently, the high failure trials percentage was more variable (wider error bars) than the CV recovery.</p>

<p>We also simulated remyelination after partial demyelination, where affected segments initially lost only half their lamellae (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref></bold>). Overall trends were similar to those for the complete demyelination case (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E-F</xref>; Supplementary Figure 4)</bold>. As expected, these simulations showed more CV recovery than when starting with complete demyelination, with less separation between the curves for different levels of remyelination. The variability in CV recovery across different remyelination conditions was similar to the variability across the 50-neuron cohort, especially when remyelinated segments had less than 50% of lamellae restored (i.e., less than the partially demyelinated segments). There were also fewer high failure trials under partial demyelination conditions, relative to the corresponding complete demyelination cases (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref></bold> vs. <bold>4F</bold>).</p>

<title>Several parameters contribute to CV changes after myelin perturbation</title>
<p>Taken together, our multi-compartment neuron model simulations showed that both demyelination and remyelination can cause substantial CV delays and AP failures within individual axons. However, responses to the same simulated dystrophy sometimes varied widely across the cohort. To identify the key parameters that contribute to CV changes, we employed lasso regression separately on the demyelination and remyelination results. For CV changes in response to demyelination (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref></bold>), only 5 out of 12 parameters had non-zero coefficients in the lasso. Among these, the weight for myelinated segment length had the largest magnitude (and was negative). This is intuitive: models with longer myelinated segments show more CV slowing in response to a given demyelination perturbation. Scale factors for leak and sodium conductance, axoplasm resistance, and tight junction resistance also affected CV change substantially in the demyelination condition. For CV recovery after remyelination (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref></bold>), the lasso selected a model with 10 of the 12 parameters (only myelin length and axoplasm resistance were omitted). To test the effectiveness of lasso, we utilized these reduced models to predict how CV would change after demyelination and remyelination in a novel cohort of 50 axons. The reduced models were effective predictors; the demyelination regression (which retained less than half of the original parameters) captured 61% of the CV change observed in simulations (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref></bold>). The remyelination regression captured 87% of the observed CV recovery (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref></bold>). Comparing these parameters with empirical data, when available, may help estimate the severity of CV delays and AP failures in the cortex of aging rhesus monkeys.</p>

<title>AP failures impair performance in a neural network model of working memory</title>
<p>Equipped with the quantification of impaired AP transmission due to myelin alterations in the single neuron model, we next elucidated how these impairments affected neural circuit function. We focused on spatial working memory because the underlying neural network mechanisms have been studied and modeled in detail (e.g. <bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Compte et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Hansel and Mato, 2013</xref></bold>; <bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Ibañez et al., 2020</xref></bold>). We built on a previous spiking neural network model that accounts for many experimental findings (<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Hansel and Mato, 2013</xref></bold>). It consists of 16,000 excitatory and 4,000 inhibitory integrate-and-fire neurons (see Methods). Neurons are coupled through excitatory synapses with AMPA and NMDA receptors, and inhibitory synapses with GABA receptors. Recurrent excitatory synapses are facilitating, which promotes robust and reliable persistent activity despite spatial heterogeneities in the connectivity or in the intrinsic properties of the neurons.</p>
<p>We first simulated the classical oculomotor delayed response task (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref></bold>) in a cohort of 10 young (control) networks with different random connectivities and intact AP transmission (see Methods). For appropriate levels of excitation and inhibition, a localized activity bump forms during the cue period, and this bump persists through the delay period. The center of the bump encodes the remembered spatial location (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B,i</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Compte et al 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Hansel and Mato, 2013</xref>)</bold>. Successful trials require a sufficiently strong activity bump throughout the delay period, quantified by the memory strength (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref></bold>, blue line). If the memory strength decreases over time (e.g. caused by the demyelination/remyelination conditions discussed below) the memory duration – the period during which the network can retain the stimulus – becomes limited (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>)</bold>. Moreover, due to random fluctuations, the activity bump diffuses along the network during the delay period. This leads to trial-to-trial variability in the cue position read out from the network activity, modeling the variability of recalled spatial locations observed empirically (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref></bold>, right panels; <bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c98">Wimmer et al., 2014</xref></bold>). This memory diffusion increases with the delay duration, consistent with decreasing working memory precision observed experimentally (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D</xref></bold>; <bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Funahashi et al., 1989</xref></bold>). The bump movement during the delay also has a directed component, i.e., a systematic bias clockwise or counterclockwise away from the cue location, caused by heterogeneities in the network connectivity (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref></bold>, right panels and <bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6E</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Hansel and Mato, 2013</xref></bold>). This memory drift is a possible explanation for delay-dependent systematic biases in working memory observed experimentally (see Discussion). However, because of their established relationship with working memory performance, in the following we focus on memory duration, corresponding to complete forgetting, and memory diffusion, corresponding to working memory precision.</p>

<p>To investigate how myelin alterations affect working memory maintenance, we explored in the network model the same demyelination and remyelination conditions as we did in the single neuron model. Because our network model consists of point neurons (i.e., without detailed axons), we incorporated CV slowing as an effective increase in synaptic transmission delays (see Methods). We found that increased propagation delays had no effect on the network performance (<bold>Supplementary Figure 6</bold>). This was as expected because, by design, the network operates in an asynchronous state with irregular neural activity in which the timing of individual spikes does not affect network function. AP failures, on the other hand, did have a large impact. To simulate AP failures we created a probabilistic model of spike transmission from the excitatory presynaptic neurons to both the excitatory and inhibitory postsynaptic neurons (see Methods). For AP failure probabilities matched to the distribution of AP failure probabilities across the cohort of 50 single model neurons, we observed a decay of the activity bump (i.e., reduced memory strength over time) in the network model. This can ultimately lead to extinction of the activity bump during the delay period, representing complete forgetting of the remembered stimulus (reduced memory duration; <bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref></bold>, ii and iii; <bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref></bold> and <bold>Supplementary Figure 7A</bold>). For a mild reduction of the bump amplitude, memory duration was not affected (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref></bold>, purple line) but memory diffusion increased compared to the control network (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref></bold>, iii <bold>and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D</xref></bold>). This increase in memory diffusion is consistent with mathematical analysis of firing rate models showing that the bump diffusion depends inversely on the squared bump amplitude (<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Kilpatrick and Ermentrout, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Esnaola-Acebes et al., 2022</xref></bold>).</p>

<title>Impact of demyelination and remyelination on working memory</title>
<p>We then systematically characterized changes in memory duration and memory diffusion by comparing working memory performance in the cohort of 10 control networks with the performance of those networks perturbed corresponding to varying degrees of demyelination (removing a fraction of myelin lamellae from a fraction of myelinated segments) and remyelination (replacing myelinated segments with two shorter and thinner myelin sheaths with a node in between).</p>
<sec id="s2e1">
<title>Demyelination impairs working memory performance compared to control networks</title>
<p>We found that the memory duration was not affected when removing up to 55% of myelin lamellae per myelinated segment, regardless of the percentage of axonal segments that were altered along an axon (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A</xref></bold>; left panel). However, when between 55% and 75% of the myelin lamellae were removed, the memory duration began to decrease, depending on the percentage of axonal segments that were demyelinated. In this case, increasing the percentage of demyelinated segments from 10% to 50% led to a progressive impairment, whereas an increase to 75% of the segments did not impair memory duration further. Finally, in cases where 100% of the myelin lamellae were removed, the memory duration dropped to ≤ 1 s, regardless of the percentage of segments that were demyelinated. In a similar trend, memory diffusion increased, that is, working memory became less precise starting when removing between 25% and 50% of the myelin lamellae (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7B</xref></bold>; left panel). Again, we found a progressive impairment, depending on the percentage of myelin lamellae removed and the percentage of myelinated segments affected, with a ceiling effect when more than 50% of segments were demyelinated.</p>

<title>Complete remyelination recovers network function</title>
<p>We observed that remyelination of all previously demyelinated segments (100%), independently of the degree of demyelination, recovered the memory duration to the control-networks-like performance (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A</xref></bold>; middle and right panels; black lines). However, working memory precision is not fully recovered in all these cases, indicated by an increase in the diffusion constant (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7B</xref></bold>). The performance of control networks was completely recovered only when 75% of the myelin lamellae were added back to the remyelinated segments.

<title>Incomplete remyelination leads to partial recovery</title>
<p>We studied the effect of incomplete remyelination (remyelination of 25% - 75% of previously demyelinated segments) after both complete and partial demyelination (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A-B</xref></bold>, middle and right panels, respectively). When we remyelinated between 25% - 75% of the previously completely demyelinated segments, we did not observe a significant recovery of the memory duration (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A</xref></bold>; middle panel; memory duration ≤ 1 s in all cases).

In sum, incomplete remyelination was unable to restore network function when bare axon (completely demyelinated) segments were present. However, when we remyelinated between 25% - 75% of the previously only partially demyelinated segments, both memory duration and memory diffusion were restored closer to the values of the control networks (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A-B</xref></bold>; right panel).</p>

<title>Fewer normal myelin sheaths lead to decreased network performance</title>
<p>Whereas up to now we have studied network models with AP transmission probabilities corresponding to a single degree of myelin alterations, we also sought to reveal the effect on working memory performance of more biologically realistic network models with AP transmission probabilities matched to both axons with intact and with altered myelin sheaths, as likely occurs in the aging brain (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref></bold>). Thus, we ran network model simulations combining AP failure probabilities corresponding to groups of neurons containing intact axons and axons presenting different degrees of demyelination (<bold><xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8A</xref></bold>; Methods). This allowed us to predict working memory deficits for a degree of demyelination that is within the empirically observed range of 90% to 100% normal myelin (<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Peters and Sethares, 2002</xref></bold>).

<title>Shorter and thinner myelinated segments impair working memory</title>
<p>Finally, to make our model predictions regarding the effects of remyelination on working memory comparable to empirical studies of axon remyelination, we combined model neurons with intact axons and with axons containing different proportions of remyelination, and we quantified the percentage of new myelin sheaths in different groups of 50 axons (<bold><xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9A</xref></bold>; Methods).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>While technical limitations in EM studies make it difficult to assess the frequency of completely demyelinated segments during aging (<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Peters and Sethares, 2003</xref></bold>), our single neuron model assumed that age-related myelin dystrophies – which are well-documented – alter the insulative properties of lamellae analogously to demyelination. As expected, CV in the single neuron model cohort slowed down more as demyelination increased. Once demyelinated segments lost at least half of their lamellae, several models exhibited high rates of AP failures. This finding is consistent with levels of demyelination causing CV delay and AP failure in past modeling studies (<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">Stephanova et al., 2005</xref></bold>; <bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">Stephanova and Daskalova, 2008</xref></bold>; <bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Naud and Longtin, 2019</xref></bold>). Past modeling studies found CV slowing of 10-25% relative to unperturbed conditions after remyelinating all segments (<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Lasiene et al., 2008</xref></bold>; <bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Powers et al., 2012</xref></bold>; <bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Scurfield and Latimer, 2018</xref></bold>), which is also in line with our results. An important novelty of our study is the systematic exploration of both demyelination and subsequent remyelination. We found that remyelination restored AP propagation to varying degrees, depending on severity of initial demyelination. A few model neurons had somewhat unexpected results, such as a CV increase relative to the unperturbed case when just 25% segments were completely remyelinated with 75% of lamellae (4% of the cohort). This behavior likely arises from a complex interplay between high current density imparted by ion channels in the nodes and altered electrotonic lengths in the segments where myelin changes occur (e.g., <bold>Waxman, 1978; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Naud and Longtin, 2019</xref></bold>), providing an opportunity for future study. Susceptibility to impairment or recovery from myelin dystrophy depends greatly on axonal morphology and biophysics, which we examined across our model cohort. Many parameters emerged as critical contributors to demyelination and remyelination effects, including axon diameter, node length, length of myelinated segments, and nodal ion channel densities. Parameters such as the axoplasm resistance, myelin resistance and capacitance, axon capacitance and tight junction resistance captured nonlinear interactions between the 5 morphologic parameters used to construct the cohort. Past modeling studies also found that these parameters affect axonal CV to different degrees (e.g., <bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Goldman and Albus, 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Moore et al., 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Babbs and Shi, 2013</xref></bold>; <bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c99">Young et al., 2013</xref></bold>; <bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Schmidt and Knösche, 2019</xref></bold>). Better empirical measurements of these parameters in monkey dlPFC, for example from 3-dimensional EM studies, would help predict the extent to which myelin dystrophy and remyelination with aging affect AP propagation.</p>
<p>With the spiking neural network model, we found that increasing probabilities of AP failure, corresponding to higher degrees of demyelination, gradually impaired the time during which stimulus information can be held in working memory, as well as working memory precision. Sufficient remyelination restored performance to the control network level. In contrast to the strong impact of AP failures on network function, introducing propagation delays to mimic AP slowing did not have an effect (<bold>Supplementary Figure 6</bold>). This is because the network operates in an asynchronous state in which the dynamics are primarily governed by the statistics of neuronal activity (e.g. firing rates), rather than precise spike timings (<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Hansel and Mato, 2013</xref></bold>; <bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c94">van Vreeswijk and Sompolinsky, 1996</xref></bold>). While highly irregular persistent activity is indeed observed in PFC during working memory tasks (<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Compte et al., 2003</xref></bold>), at the mesoscopic level oscillations of the local field potentials and synchronization also play an important role (<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Liebe et al., 2012</xref></bold>; <bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Buschman et al., 2012</xref></bold>; <bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Gregoriou et al., 2009</xref></bold>; <bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Salazar et al., 2012</xref></bold>). AP slowing may alter these neural oscillations and synchrony which could lead to further working memory impairment not captured by our network model. In addition to age-related changes in memory duration and precision, our network model predicts an age-related increase in systematic errors due to an increased drift of the activity bump (<bold>Supplementary Figure 8</bold>). Delay-dependent systematic working memory errors have been observed in behavioral experiments (<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bae, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Panichello et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">Stein et al., 2021</xref></bold>) and it would be interesting to test whether those biases also change with aging. While the prefrontal cortex is certainly a key player in working memory, it is not the only brain area involved in this function; working memory is likely sustained by the interaction of several fronto-parietal brain areas (<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Leavitt et al., 2017</xref></bold>; <bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Christophel et al., 2017</xref></bold>). A natural extension of this work, that we will address in future studies, is the development of large-scale models of working memory (<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Mejías and Wang, 2022</xref></bold>), incorporating myelin alterations in the neuronal axons forming local circuits in the cortical areas involved in and projecting to white matter tracts of inter-area connections.</p>
<p>For biologically realistic combinations of neurons with intact and demyelinated axons, our network model predicts that myelin dystrophies alone would lead to spatial working memory impairment with aging (<bold><xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref></bold>). This result supports the observation that cognitive impairment increases as the percentage of normal myelin sheaths decreases (<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Peters and Sethares, 2002</xref></bold>). In addition, combining neurons containing either intact or remyelinated axons, we found that insufficient remyelination also leads to spatial working memory impairment (<bold><xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9</xref></bold>). This result may explain two seemingly contradictory empirical findings. One study showed a positive correlation between cognitive impairment and a higher percentage of new, shorter and thinner, myelin sheaths (<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Peters and Sethares, 2003</xref></bold>). A second study found that, with aging, oligodendroglia have a decreased capacity for effective maturation, remaining in a progenitor state without being able to produce new myelin. This low capacity for remyelination was correlated with spatial working memory impairment in the monkeys (<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Dimovasili et al., 2022</xref></bold>). Our single neuron model may unify these results in the following way. First, <bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Scurfield and Latimer (2018)</xref></bold> found that insufficiently remyelinated axons, with large numbers of transitions between long (unperturbed) and new shorter segments, have slower CV compared to the unperturbed axons; in general we observed this too. Second, our models showed that axons with demyelinated segments, or otherwise poorly insulated myelin sheaths, experience delayed and even failed AP propagation, and in turn, lead to working memory impairment. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that ineffective remyelination may lead to working memory impairment. In fact, complete remyelination of all the previously demyelinated segments with sufficient myelin, with fewer transitions between long and short segments, recovered working memory function. Our findings also suggest that differences in the degree of demyelination or remyelination (<bold><xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figures 8</xref> and <xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">9</xref></bold>) may account for the cognitive variability observed across individuals with aging, which encompass individuals with both good (<italic>successful agers</italic>) and impaired (<italic>unsuccessful</italic> agers) cognitive function (<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Lacreuse et al., 2005</xref></bold>; <bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Moore et al., 2006</xref></bold>; <bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Moore et al., 2017</xref></bold>; <bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Moss et al., 2007</xref></bold>).</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>The multiscale modeling approach introduced here opens the door to studying the combined effect on working memory of several changes observed with aging in the monkey dlPFC (review: <bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Luebke et al., 2010</xref></bold>). For example, in our previous work (<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Ibañez et al., 2020</xref></bold>) we modeled increased AP firing rates observed <italic>in vitro</italic> together with the loss of both excitatory and inhibitory synapses, and quantified how these alterations affected working memory performance. We found that in “aged” DRT networks that were able to maintain the memory of the stimulus, as in <bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c95">Wang et al. (2011)</xref></bold>, higher firing rates in individual pyramidal neurons and the loss of excitatory and inhibitory synapses partially compensated each other in order to maintain the memory. However, complete compensation only occurred when the overall excitatory drive of the network further decreased. It is conceivable that such a decrease in excitation could arise from AP failures induced by myelin dystrophy, as shown here. It has also been hypothesized that the age-related hyperexcitability of pyramidal neurons observed <italic>in vitro</italic> could work as a homeostatic regulatory mechanism to compensate for AP delays and disruptions due to dystrophic myelin (<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Luebke et al., 2010</xref></bold>). The multicompartment model used here is particularly well-suited to simultaneous modeling of age-related changes in the soma, dendrites, synapses, and axon of individual pyramidal neurons. This can include changes to the nodes of Ranvier (reviewed in <bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Arancibia-Carcamo and Attwell, 2014</xref></bold>) and to the metabolic network associated with demyelinated neurons including higher oxygen consumption rates (<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Gerevich et al., 2023</xref></bold>), which were not modeled here. To accurately quantify the effect of these three changes together on network performance, a detailed quantification of age-related myelin dystrophies and remyelination along the axons of pyramidal neurons, for example in dlPFC, would be needed.</p>
<p>Myelin dystrophy happens in many neurological conditions, including multiple sclerosis, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, autism spectrum disorders, and after traumatic brain injury (<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93">Valdés-Tovar et al., 2022</xref></bold>; <bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">Takahashi et al., 2011</xref></bold>; <bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Gouvêa-Junqueira et al., 2020</xref></bold>; <bold>Franklin and ffrench-Constant, 2008</bold>; <bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Armstrong et al., 2016</xref></bold>; <bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Galvez-Contreras et al., 2020</xref></bold>; <bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">Simkins et al., 2021</xref></bold>), in which cognitive functions are severely affected. Working memory is often one of the most vulnerable cognitive functions in these conditions, in particular in schizophrenia or autism spectrum disorders (<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Gold and Luck, 2023</xref></bold>; <bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Hahn et al., 2018</xref></bold>; <bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c96">Wang et al., 2017</xref></bold>). Thus, our findings have broader impact beyond aging and have implications for many demyelinating conditions. Overall, our study shows that myelin changes alone can account for working memory impairment, pointing to myelin degradation as a key factor in working memory decline with aging and other neurological conditions.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="s4a">
<title>Single Neuron Model</title>
<p>To simulate age-related myelin dystrophies in individual neurons, we used a biophysically detailed multicompartment model of a rhesus monkey dlPFC Layer 3 pyramidal neuron (<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Rumbell et al., 2016</xref></bold>), executed in the NEURON simulation environment (<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Carnevale and Hines, 2006</xref></bold>). The soma, apical and basal dendritic arbors were constructed schematically, scaled to the overall surface area of a three-dimensional morphologic reconstruction from empirical data (68 compartments total; details in <bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Rumbell et al. (2016)</xref></bold>). Ion channel conductances and kinetics were fit to electrophysiological data obtained <italic>in vitro</italic> from the same neuron. In addition to passive membrane dynamics, the model included two sodium channels (fast inactivating, NaF; and non-inactivating persistent, NaP), three potassium channels (delayed rectifier, KDR; muscarinic receptor-suppressed, KM; transient inactivating A-type, KA), a high-threshold non-inactivating calcium channel (CaL), a calcium-dependent slow potassium channel (KAHP), and the hyperpolarization-activated anomalous rectifier channel (AR). Because our prime focus was quantifying alterations in action potential (AP) propagation along the axon under dystrophic myelin conditions, we augmented the axon hillock and initial segment of the <bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Rumbell et al. (2016)</xref></bold> model (5 compartments each) by attaching nodes and myelinated segments from a detailed axon model (<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Gow and Devaux, 2008</xref></bold>; <bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Scurfield and Latimer, 2018</xref></bold>). To the initial segment we attached 101 nodes (13 compartments each) alternating with 100 myelinated segments. Each myelinated segment was bound by a group of four paranodes (5 compartments each) on either side, with an internode flanked by two juxtaparanodes (9 and 5 compartments each, respectively) sandwiched between the paranode groups (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref></bold>). On both ends of a myelinated segment the extreme outward paranode interfaced with the adjoining node. Segments between successive nodes were endowed with myelin lamellae (wraps), and with tight junctions between the innermost lamella and the axolemma necessary for improving insulation and accurate modeling of AP propagation in nerve fibers with diameters less than 0.9 <italic>μ</italic>m as often observed in PFC. Axon compartments included passive membrane dynamics as well as the NaF and KDR channels in the nodes. Simulations used a fixed 0.025 ms time step.</p>
<p>As done during <italic>in vitro</italic> electrophysiological experiments (<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Chang et al., 2005</xref></bold>; <bold>Ibanez et al., 2020</bold>) and past modeling studies (<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Coskren et al., 2015</xref></bold>; <bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Rumbell et al., 2016</xref></bold>), we first applied a holding current to stabilize the somatic membrane potential at -70 mV, then injected a +380 pA current step into the somatic compartment for 2 seconds. We recorded the somatic firing rate, as well as the conduction velocity (CV) of APs propagating from the first node after the initial segment (proximal to the soma) and the penultimate node (at the distal end). The CV was relatively insensitive to variations in the magnitude of suprathreshold somatic current steps, and whether the current was constant or included Gaussian noise. Therefore, we quantified CV changes and AP failures from responses to constant +380 pA current steps.</p>

<title>Building a cohort of control model neurons</title>
<p>Recognizing that the effects of myelin dystrophy may depend on the physical dimensions of an axon, we constructed a cohort of neuron models that were consistent with empirical measurements of axonal morphology in young adult rhesus monkeys. To form this ‘control’ model cohort, we identified five parameters of axonal morphology which have been measured empirically in rhesus monkey cortex: axon diameter (<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Peters et al., 2001</xref></bold>; <bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Bowley et al., 2010</xref></bold>; D.L. Rosene, unpublished observations), node length (<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Peters and Sethares, 2003</xref></bold>), length of myelinated segments (<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c97">Waxman, 1980</xref></bold>), number of myelin lamellae (<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Peters and Sethares, 2003</xref></bold>), and thickness of each lamella <bold>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Moore et al., 1978</xref></bold>; <bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Peters and Sethares, 2003</xref></bold>). We also defined three scale factors defining the ratio of leak, NaF, and KDR conductances in our nodes relative to those of the <bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Scurfield and Latimer (2018)</xref></bold> model, assuming an upper bound of 1 for each. This gave a total of eight parameters with associated feasible parameter ranges that we varied (<bold><xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref></bold>); other parameters including tight junction resistivity, myelin resistivity, and myelin capacitance were held fixed at values from <bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Scurfield and Latimer (2018)</xref></bold>. We then used the space-filling Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS) design (<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Morris and Mitchell, 1995</xref></bold>; <bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Rumbell et al., 2016</xref></bold>; <bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Ibañez et al., 2020</xref></bold>) to identify a set of 1600 points in parameter space that maximized the minimum distance between all pairs of points. We simulated each model specified by these points, and had several selection criteria for identifying biologically plausible models. First we constrained somatic firing rates within ranges observed empirically in Layer 3 pyramidal neurons of rhesus monkey dlPFC: firing 13-16 Hz in response to the +380 pA current step and silent when no current was injected (<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Chang et al., 2005</xref></bold>; <bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Ibañez et al., 2020</xref></bold>). We also required CVs of 0.3 –0.8 m/s (rhesus monkey corpus callosum, D.L. Rosene, unpublished observations), and ensured that simulated APs were suprathreshold in the nodes and subthreshold in the juxtaparanode and internode regions, indicating saltatory conduction. Of the 1600 simulated models, 138 met these criteria; for the present study, we randomly selected 50 models to comprise the control model cohort. The g-ratio (ratio of axon to fiber diameter) among models in the cohort was 0.71 ± 0.02, with total axon lengths of 1.2 ± 0.1 cm.</p>

<title>Simulating myelin alterations</title>
<p>We assumed that the effect of all myelin dystrophies observed empirically (e.g. <bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref></bold>) could be modeled by removing lamellae from myelinated segments (demyelination, which reduces electrical insulation), and that remyelination could be modeled by replacing myelinated segments with two shorter and thinner segments with a node in between. To simulate demyelination, we varied two independent factors: the percentage of myelinated segments selected for demyelination along an axon (demyelination percentage), and the percentage of myelin lamellae removed from those segments (lamellae removal percentage). For each demyelination percentage (10, 25, 50, and 75%; <bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref></bold>), we generated 30 randomized lists of segments to demyelinate. Then for each of the 30 trials, each lamellae removal percentage was applied (25, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, and 100%) to the chosen segments, for all 50 models in the cohort. We then simulated the +380 pA current step, calculating the CV and the number of APs that propagated to the distal end of the axon. For each perturbation, we defined the CV change as the percentage change in CV induced relative to the CV of the corresponding unperturbed model. We also computed, for each perturbation, the percentage of AP failures at the distal axon end, relative to the number of APs observed at the first node. Trials with AP failure rates of 75% or more were labeled as ‘high failure trials’.</p>
<p>To simulate remyelination three factors were varied: the percentage of myelinated segments initially demyelinated (demyelination percentage: 25, 50, 75%); the percentage of those affected segments which were then remyelinated (remyelination percentage: 25, 50, 75, 100%); and the percentage of lamellae restored with remyelination (lamellae restoration percentage: 10, 25, 50, 75%). We performed these remyelination simulations under two demyelination conditions: where the initially demyelinated segments had lost all their lamellae (‘complete demyelination’), or had lost half their lamellae (‘partial demyelination’). Sample remyelination perturbations shown in <bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref></bold>. Remyelination was performed by replacing an affected (previously demyelinated) segment with two shorter segments, each including paranodes, juxtaparanodes, and an internode, and a new node between them. The number of lamellae on the shorter segments was determined by the lamellae restoration percentage. As before, for each demyelination percentage (25, 50, and 75%), we generated 30 randomized lists of segments to demyelinate. Segments to remyelinate were decided based on remyelination percentage. For example, in the case of 50% remyelination every alternate (previously) demyelinated segment was remyelinated. Then for each trial, we applied each combination of remyelination percentage and lamellae restoration percentage to the chosen segments, for all models in the cohort; and simulated the current clamp protocol. For each remyelination condition, in addition to computing the percentage of high failure trials, we defined CV recovery as the percentage improvement in CV relative to the CV change for the completely demyelinated case. For example, if a control model had a CV of 1 m/s, and a CV of 0.6 m/s after complete demyelination, then the CV change was -0.4/1.0 = -40%. If a subsequent remyelination condition led to a CV of 0.8 m/s (an increase of 0.2 m/s over the demyelinated case), the CV recovery was 0.2/0.4 = 50%.</p>

<title>Statistical assessment of model parameter importance</title>
<p>To identify which parameters of the multicompartment model had the greatest influence on axonal responses to demyelination and remyelination perturbations, we used least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (lasso) regression (<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">Tibshirani, 1996</xref></bold>; <bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">James et al., 2021</xref></bold>), implemented in MATLAB R2022a (Mathworks, Natick, MA).

</disp-formula>
for a given value of <italic>λ</italic> (<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">James et al., 2021</xref></bold>). The former quantity is the residual sum of squares of the model. The latter quantity is the absolute sum of coefficients; including it in the minimization shrinks some coefficients to zero when <italic>λ</italic> is sufficiently large, enabling lasso to perform feature selection. The tuning parameter <italic>λ</italic> was selected to minimize the 10-fold cross validation error; then for the selected value of <italic>λ</italic>, the regression was repeated using all available data. A total of 12 parameters served as predictor variables for the lasso regression. We started with 6 of the 8 parameters used to construct the cohort (axon diameter, node length, myelin length, and scale factors for leak, NaF, and KDR conductances), and combined two others parameters (number of myelin lamellae and lamella thickness) into one quantity: myelin thickness (their product). Past studies (<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Goldman and Albus, 1968</xref></bold>; <bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Koles and Rasminsky, 1972</xref></bold>; <bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Moore et al. 1978</xref></bold>; <bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Gow and Devaux, 2008</xref></bold>) identified several other parameters that affect axonal propagation, including the g-ratio, axoplasmic resistance, axon capacitance, myelin resistance, myelin capacitance, and tight junction resistance. We added five of these parameters to the seven cohort parameters as predictor variables, omitting only g-ratio due to its high correlation with axon diameter and myelin thickness. We created response variables summarizing the effects of demyelination and remyelination on CV in each of the 50 members of the model cohort. AP failures were recorded as CV change of -100%. We did not include high failure trials as a response variable, since CV changes precede AP failures. For demyelination, we averaged the CV change for all randomized trials in which 100% of lamellae were removed from 25%, 50% and 75% of segments. For remyelination, we averaged the CV recovery in all randomized trials in which 25, 50, or 75% of segments were completely demyelinated, and then all affected segments were remyelinated as two shorter segments with 75% of lamellae added back. To facilitate comparison, we z-scored all predictor and response variables before performing lasso separately on each response. We tested the predictive ability of the lasso models by randomly selecting another 50 of the 138 models from the original hypercube that met the inclusion criteria, then simulating the specific myelin alteration protocols that comprised the demyelination and remyelination response variables. We computed Pearson’s correlation coefficient between the z-scored predicted vs. observed responses.</p>

<title>Simulating a cohort of young (control) networks</title>
<p>Using the Brian2 simulator (based on Python), we simulated 10 different networks, all with the same parameters, but each with a different connectivity profile. For each network, we ran 280 trials, with different initial conditions and cue positions. All networks performed the DRT – with 2 seconds fixation period, 1 second cue period and 4 seconds delay period – and maintained the memory of the stimulus during the whole delay period of the task (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B,i</xref></bold> and <bold>Supplementary Figure 5A, left panel).</bold></p>

<title>Modeling action potential propagation failures in the network</title>
<p>To model the action potential failures at the distal end of the axons quantified with the single neuron model under the different demyelination and remyelination conditions, we perturbed the 10 control networks by designing a probabilistic model of spike transmission from the excitatory presynaptic neurons to both the excitatory and inhibitory postsynaptic neurons. From the single neuron model, for each demyelination/remyelination condition, we quantified the probability of AP failure for each of the neurons in the control cohort, as well as the percentage of those neurons that shared the same probabilities of failure. That is, the percentage of neurons that had probability of failure = 0, probability of failure = 1 or any other probability. Then, we computed the probability of transmission, <italic>P</italic><sub><italic>transmission</italic></sub> = 1 − <italic>P</italic><sub><italic>failure</italic></sub>, and we specified <italic>P</italic><sub><italic>transmission</italic></sub> for the corresponding percentages of excitatory neurons in the networks.

<title>Modeling conduction velocity slowing in the network</title>
<p>To explore the effect of CV slowing along the axons of model neurons, we simulated 20 control networks and 20 networks for the case of demyelination of 50% of the segments along the axons of model neurons by removing 60% of the myelin lamellae (we ran 280 trials for each network). Then, we added random delays – with a minimum value of 0 ms and a maximum value of 100 ms in the control networks, and of 40 ms in the perturbed networks – in both the AMPA and NMDA excitatory connections to both E and I neurons (<bold>Supplementary Figure 6</bold>).</p>

<title>Quantification of normal myelin sheaths in groups of model neurons containing both intact and demyelinated axons</title>
<p>We created different groups of 50 total model neurons containing, among those 50, different random amounts of neurons with intact axons and with demyelinated axons, with either 10, 25, 50 or 75% of segments demyelinated. In each group, the distribution of the demyelinated segments along the altered axons was also randomly chosen among the 30 possible distributions simulated with the single neuron model. We sorted the axons in each group by locating their origin aligned in the same position, divided the axons longitudinally in sections of 0.5 <italic>μ</italic>m, and calculated the percentage of normal, unperturbed myelin sheaths in each section (<bold><xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8A</xref></bold>). Then, we averaged across all sections and we picked 60 groups that had over 80% of normal myelin sheaths. According to the proportion of intact and demyelinated axons (with either 10, 25, 50 or 75% of segments affected) in each group, we adjusted the distribution of AP transmission probability (<italic>P</italic><sub><italic>transmission</italic></sub>; <italic>P</italic><sub><italic>transmission</italic></sub> = <italic>1</italic> for intact axons) in 1 of the 10 control networks.

In each group, the distribution of the remyelinated segments along the altered axons was randomly chosen among the 30 possible distributions.

<title>Measures of working memory performance</title>
<p>The remembered location was obtained using a population vector decoder and network performance was quantified by the following four measures that describe the quality of the activity bump maintaining a memory of the stimulus during the delay period: the memory strength, the memory duration, the drift rate and the diffusion constant.</p>
<sec id="s4b3a1">
<title>Memory strength</title>
<p>The memory strength was defined as the modulus <italic>M</italic>(<italic>t</italic>) of the population vector, <italic>Z</italic>(<italic>t</italic>), which characterizes the spatial modulation of the excitatory neuronal activity at time t, given by
<disp-formula>
<graphic xlink:href="555476v1_ueqn6.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
<italic>r</italic><sub><italic>j</italic></sub>(<italic>t</italic>) is the firing rate of neuron <italic>j</italic> with preferred direction <italic>θ</italic><sub><italic>j</italic></sub>. Firing rates <italic>r</italic><sub><italic>j</italic></sub>(<italic>t</italic>) were estimated as spike counts in a 250 ms window. A memory strength <italic>M</italic>(<italic>t</italic>) close to 0 indicates homogeneous activity of the network and <italic>M</italic>(<italic>t</italic>) close to 1 indicates a sharply modulated activity (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref></bold>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4b3a">
<title>Decoded cue location</title>
<p><italic>Ψ</italic>(<italic>t</italic>) is the argument of <italic>Z</italic>(<italic>t</italic>) and indicates the remembered stimulus location. That is, the center of the activity bump (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref></bold>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4b3b">
<title>Memory duration</title>
<p>The memory duration was defined as the time from the delay onset until the time where the memory strength decayed below a fixed threshold that we set at 0.4. That is, the memory duration is the interval during which the bump of neural activity is reliably maintained (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref></bold>).</p>

<p>Summary: The authors study the effects of myelin alterations in working memory via the complementary use of two computational approaches: one based on the de- and re-myelination in multicompartmental models of pyramidal neurons, and one based on synaptic changes in a spiking bump attractor model for spatial working memory. The first model provides the most precise angle (biophysically speaking) of the different effects (loss of myelin lamella or segments, remyelination with thinner and shorter nodes, etc), while the second model allows to infer the consequences of myelin alterations in working memory performance, including memory stability, duration, and bump diffusion. The results indicate (i) a slowing down and failure of propagation of spikes with demyelination and partial recovery with remyelination, with detailed predictions on the role of nodes and myelina lamella, and (ii) a decrease in memory duration and an increase in memory drift as a function of the demyelination, in agreement with multiple experimental studies.</p>
<p>Strengths: Overall, the work offers a very interesting approach of a topic which is hard to accomplish experimentally --therefore the computational take is entirely justified and extremely useful. The authors carefully designed the computational experiments to shed light into the demyelination effects on working memory from multiple levels of description, increasing the reliability of their conclusions. I think this work is solid and has the potential to be influential in future studies of myelin alterations (and related disorders such as multiple sclerosis).</p>
<p>Weaknesses: In its current form, the study still presents several issues which prevent it from achieving a higher potential impact. These can be summarized in two main items. First, the manuscript is missing some important details about how demyelination and remyelination are incorporated in both models (and what is the connection between both implementations). For example, it is unclear whether an unperturbed axon and a fully remyelinated axon would be mathematically equivalent in the multicompartment model, or how the changes in the number of nodes, myelin lamella, etc, are implemented in the spiking neural network model. Second, it is unclear whether some of the conclusions are strong computational predictions or just a consequence of the model chosen. For example, the lack of effect of decreasing the conduction velocity on working memory performance could be due to the choice of considering a certain type of working memory model (continuous attractor), and therefore be absent under other valid assumptions (i.e. a silent working memory model, which has a higher dependence on temporal synaptic dynamics).</p>
<p>With additional simulations to address these issues, I consider that the present study would become a convincing milestone in the computational modeling of myelin-related models, and an important study in the field of working memory.</p>

<p>This paper analyzes the effect of axon de-myelination and re-myelination on action potential speed, and propagation failure. Next, the findings are then incorporated in a standard spiking ring attractor model of working memory.</p>
<p>I think the results are not very surprising or solid and there are issues with method and presentation.</p>
<p>
The authors did many simulations with random parameters, then averaged the result, and found for instance that the Conduction Velocity drops in demyelination. It gives the reader little insight into what is really going on. My personal preference is for a well understood simple model rather than a poorly understood complex model. The link between the model outcome of WM and data remains qualitative, and is further weakened by the existence of known other age-related effects in PFC circuits.</p>
<p>* Both for the de/re myelination the spatial patterns are fully random. Why is this justified?</p>
<p>
* Similarly, to model the myelin parameters where drawn from uniform distributions, Table 1 (I guess). Again, why is this reasonable?</p>
<p>* The focus of most analysis is on the conduction velocity but in the end, this has no effect on WM, so the discussion of CV remains sterile.</p>
<p>* The more important effect of de/re myelination is on failure.</p>
<p>
However, the failure is, AFAIK, just characterized by a constant current injection of 380pA.</p>
<p>
From Fig 2 it seems however that the first spike is particularly susceptible to failure.</p>
<p>
In other words, it has not been justified that it is fine to use the failure rates from this artificial protocol in the I&amp;F model. I would expect the temporal current trace to affect whether the propagation fails or not.</p>
<p>
I don't know if there are many axon-collaterals in the WM circuits and or distance dependence in the connectivity, but if so, then the current implementation of failure would be questionable.</p>
<p>
I would also advise against thresholding at 75% failure in Fig3C. Why don't the authors not simply plot the failure rate?</p>
<p>Regarding the presentation, there are a number of dead-end results that are not used further on. The paper is rather extensive, and it would be clearer if written up in half the space. In addition, much information is really supplementary. The issue of the CV I already mentioned, also the Lasso regression for instance remains unused.</p>
