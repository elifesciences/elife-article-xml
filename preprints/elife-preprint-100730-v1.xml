<title>Abstract</title><p>The first cell-fate decision is the process by which cells of an embryo take on distinct lineage identities for the first time, thus representing the beginning of developmental patterning. Here, we demonstrate that the molecular chaperone heat shock protein A2 (HSPA2), a member of the 70 kDa heat shock protein (HSP70) family, is asymmetrically expressed in the late 2-cell stage of mouse embryos. The knockdown of <italic>Hspa2</italic> in one of the two-cell blastomeres prevented its progeny predominantly toward the inner cell mass (ICM) fate, thus indicating that the differential distribution of HSPA2 in the blastomeres of two-cell embryos can influence the selection of embryonic cell lineages. In contrast, the overexpression of <italic>Hspa2</italic> in one of the two-cell blastomeres did not induce blastomeres to differentiate towards the ICM fate. Furthermore, we demonstrated that HSPA2 forms a complex with CARM1 and activates ICM-specific gene expression. Collectively, our results identify HSPA2 as a critical regulator of the first cell-fate decision which specifies the ICM via the execution of commitment and differentiation phases.</p>

<label>1.</label><title>Introdution</title>
<p>The preimplantation development of mammalian embryos is a complex and orderly process. The first cell-fate decision is a key event in the preimplantation development in mammalian embryos. Specifically, the first cell-fate decision occurs at the morula stage following embryonic compaction and results in the division of embryonic cells into two distinct lineages: the trophectoderm (TE) and the inner cell mass (ICM). The TE is a single layer surrounding the fluid-filled cavity known as the blastocoel that provides extraembryonic structures such as the placenta, whereas the ICM, which is attached to the inside of the TE, contains pluripotent cells that give rise to the fetus and extraembryonic tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>]. However, it remains an open question that how these cells shape the first cell-fate decisions of preimplantation development, and when they begin to trigger the initial differentiation signals.</p>
<p>The asymmetry of the blastocyst may be traced back to the asymmetric nuclear abundance of coactivator-associated arginine methyltransferase 1(CARM1) at the 4-cell stage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>]. The heterogeneous activity of CARM1 leads to the differential methylation of H3 methylation of arginine 26 (H3R26me). More extensive methylation of H3R26me can result in a higher increase in the expression levels of ICM-specific genes (e.g., <italic>Oct4</italic>, <italic>Nanog</italic> and <italic>Sox2</italic>) and global chromatin accessibility, which directs their progeny into the ICM fate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>]. Recent study has further suggested that asymmetry of the blastomere can even be traced back to the 2-cell stage. For example, a long non-coding RNA, <italic>LincGET</italic>, is known to be asymmetrically expressed in the nuclei of blastomeres in 2 and 4-cell embryos. Specifically, <italic>LincGET</italic> and CARM1 are known to form a complex that promotes the H3 methylation of arginine 26 (H3R26me) and activates the expression of genes in the ICM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>]. In addition, HMGA1, a member of the high mobility group (HMG) protein family, is also known to exhibit heterogeneity as early as the two-cell stage and involves in cell fate differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>]. Collectively, these studies suggest that molecular heterogeneity takes place in the early stage of embryonic development and is associated with cell fate differentiation.</p>
<p>Despite these findings, the specific factors that exhibit heterogeneity at the two-cell stage and the mechanisms by which the cell fate and differentiation can be decided still require further investigation. The molecular chaperone heat shock protein A2 (HSPA2) is a member of the 70 kDa heat shock protein (HSP70) family that is evolutionarily conserved in human and metazoan. It is originally identified in male germ cells and described as a testis-specific protein that is essential for spermatogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>]. The <italic>Hspa2</italic> gene is located on chromosome 14 (14q24.1)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>], and the aberrant expression of HSPA2 in testes was shown to induces primary spermatocytes to arrest in meiosis I and undergo apoptosis, thus leading to male infertility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>]. HSPA2 expression in somatic tissues and during mouse embryogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>], and high levels of HSPA2 expression play a critical role in the genesis and progression of carcinoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>]. However, the role of HSPA2 in lineage differentiation of embryonic cells is yet to be unveiled.</p>
<p>In this study, we separated blastomeres from the 4-cell stage and cultured to the morula stage, analyzed the gene expression pattern by using Smart-seq2 to identify differentially expressed genes. <italic>Hspa2</italic> was identified and was shown to be asymmetrically distributed in two- to four-cell blastomeres. The knockdown of <italic>Hspa2</italic> in one of the two cell blastomeres at the 2-cell embryo preventedits progeny predominantly towards the ICM fate. Furthermore, HSPA2 and CARM1 were found to form a protein complex and regulate ICM-specific gene expression. Collectively, these results suggest that heterogeneity in <italic>Hspa2</italic> expression patterns can affect cell fate bias in the mouse embryo as early as the 2-cell stage.</p>

<label>2.2</label><title>Mouse embryo collection</title>
<p>Animal experiments were approved by the Ethics Committee of Shandong University. ICR mice (6–8 weeks-of-age) were purchased from Beijing Vital River Laboratory Animal Technology Co., Ltd. and bred under standard SPF conditions with a 12 h dark and 12 h light cycle with food and water provided ad libitum). Superovulation was induced by an intraperitoneal injection of 5 IU of pregnant mare’s serum gonadotrophin (PMSG) (110914564, Ningbo Sansheng Biological Technology Co., Ltd) followed 46–48 h later by 5 IU of human chorionic gonadotrophin (HCG) (110911282, Ningbo Sansheng Biological Technology Co., Ltd.). Oocytes were collected 15 h after hCG injection. First, the collected oocytes were fertilized in G-IVF (#10,136, Vitrolife) with epididymal sperm from adult males that had been capacitated in G-IVF for 1 h. All zygotes were cultured in G1 medium (Vitrolife, Sweden) at 37 ℃ in the presence of 6% CO<sub>2</sub> and 5% O<sub>2</sub>. Early 2-, late 2-, 4-, and 8-cell embryos, and morula- and blastocyst stage embryos were collected after 22–26, 34-38, 48–50, 60-65, 70–75, and 96–100 h of culture, respectively. Single blastomeres were isolated from 2- and 4-cell embryos and cultured to the morula stage as described previously[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>].</p>

<label>2.7</label><title>Western blot analysis and co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP)</title>
<p>Protein concentration was determined with a BCA protein assay (Bio-Rad, Hemel Hempstead, UK). Proteins were then separated by 12% SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA, USA) at 300mA for 90min. First, the membranes were incubated in TBST containing 5% non-fat milk for 2h; then, the membranes were incubated with primary antibodies (Abcam: CDX2 (ab76541), 1:1000 dilution; NANOG (ab17338) 1:800 dilution; Cell Signaling Technology: CARM1 (12495s), 1:1000 dilution; Proteintech: SOX2 (11064-1-AP), 1:800 dilution; GAPDH (10494-1-AP), 1:1500 dilution; HSPA2 (12797-1-AP), 1:1000 dilution; ACTIN (66009-1-Ig), 1:700 dilution; Santa Cruz Biotech: OCT4 (sc-5279), 1:800 dilution) overnight at 4°C. On the second day, the membranes were washed three times with TBST and then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (1:2000 dilution; Proteintech) for 1 h.</p>
<p>The Pierce Co-IP kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) was used for co-IP assays. In brief, mESCs were lysed using IP lysis buffer on ice. Next, the lysate was treated with agarose resin at 4°C for 1 h followed by incubation with antibodies (Proteintech: HSPA2(12797-1-AP), 1:100 dilution; CARM1(55246-1-AP), 1:60 dilution) at 4°C overnight.

<label>2.8</label><title>RNA FISH and immunofluorescence</title>
<p>Fluorescence <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization (FISH) was carried out using an RNA-FISH Probe kit (GenePharma, Shanghai), according to the manufacturer’s instruction. In brief, embryos were collected and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS-DEPC for 15 min at room temperature, permeabilized in 0.1%BufferA (permeabilizing solution) for 15 min at room temperature, and incubated at 37°C in 2× Buffer C for 30 min. The embryos were then dehydrated in 70%, 85%, and 100% EtOH and dried at room temperature for 5 min each time. The embryos were denatured in buffer E (hybridization buffer) containing 10 μM probe at 73°C for 5 min, incubated at 37°C overnight, and washed in 0.1% Buffer F for 5 min to remove non-specific binding. After washing in 2× Buffer C and 1× Buffer C (neutral solution) for 5 min, the nuclei were stained with DAPI for 5 min</p>
<p>To perform immunofluorescence, we removed the zona pellucida with acid Tyrode’s solution (Sigma). After that, embryos were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS (KGB5001, KeyGEN BioTECH) at room temperature (RT). Embryos were then permeabilized with 1% Triton-100 (T8787, SigmaAldrich) in PBS for 20 min. Embryos were blocked for 30 min at RT on a shaker with a blocking buffer consisting of 1% BSA in PBS containing 0.1% Tween-20 (P9416, Sigma-Aldrich) and 0.01% Triton-100. Next, embryos were incubated with primary antibodies (Abcam: CDX2 (ab76541), 1:150 dilution; H3R26me2 (ab127095), 1:150 dilution; Santa Cruz Biotech: OCT4 (sc-5279), 1:100 dilution) diluted in blocking buffer on a shaker at 4-℃ overnight. On the second day, embryos were washed three times with TBST and incubated with secondary antibody (1:400 dilution; Sigma) and DAPI (D3571, 1:400 dilution; Life Technologies) for 30 min. First, embryos were rinsed three times for 10 min in washing buffer on a shaker at RT; then, the embryos were mounted on slides in washing buffer and examined under a laser scanning confocal microscope (Dragonfly, Andor Technology, UK). Immunofluorescence images were analyzed by ImageJ Software (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/">https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/</ext-link>). To analyze the ICM/TE cell numbers, OCT4 and CDX2 signal at inner layers and outer layers were used to distinguish the ICM and TE cells.</p>

<p>For molecular docking analysis, we first generated a PPI network and identified core targets. The proposed protein model was based on the crystal structure downloaded from the AlphaFold Protein Structure Database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://alphafold.ebi.ac.uk/">https://alphafold.ebi.ac.uk/</ext-link>) and the two- and three-dimensional (2D/3D) structures of potential active compounds were acquired from PubChem (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/">https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/</ext-link>). Then, molecular docking analysis was performed and visualized in Maestro11.9; the resultant docking score was saved and then compared.</p>

<p>For proteomics and bioinformatic analysis, 4 embryos per sample were collected. Four replicates were assessed for NC group and two replicates were assessed for KD group. Protein samples were sonicated three times on ice using a high intensity ultrasonic processor (Scientz) in lysis buffer (8 M urea, 1% protease inhibitor cocktail). Inhibitors were also added to lysis buffer for PTM experiments. The remaining debris was removed by centrifugation at 12,000 g at 4°C for 10 min. The protein samples were then diluted by adding 200 mM of TEAB to urea concentrations &lt; 2 M. Finally, trypsin was added at a 1:50 trypsin-to-protein mass ratio for the first digestion overnight and a 1:100 trypsin-to-protein mass ratio for a second 4 h-digestion. Finally, the peptides were desalted with a Strata X SPE column. The eluted peptides were then cleaned with C18 ZipTips (Millipore) in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions, followed by analysis with LC–MS/MS. The resulting MS/MS data were processed by MaxQuant with an integrated Andromeda search engine (version 1.4.1.2). False discovery rate thresholds for proteins, peptides and modification sites were specified at 1%.</p>
<p>COG, full name is Clusters of Orthologous Groups of proteins. The proteins that make up each COG are assumed to be derived from an ancestral protein, Orthologs are proteins that are derived from different species, evolved from vertical lineages (species formation), and typically retain the same function as the original protein. COG means “cluster of homologous proteins” in Chinese. COGs are divided into two categories, one for prokaryotes and the other for eukaryotes. Those for prokaryotes are generally referred to as COG databases; those for eukaryotes are generally referred to as KOG databases. Compared to other databases, such as NCBI’s COG database, EggNOG provides a more comprehensive classification of species and more homologous protein sequences, with phylogenetic tree construction and functional annotation for each homologous gene cluster.</p>

<label>3.1</label><title><italic>Hspa</italic>2 is asymmetrically expressed between mouse two- and four-cell blastomeres</title>
<p>In our previous study, we established a culture system that allows blastomeres without their zona pellucida to develop in vitro until the blastocyst stage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>]. Here, in order to expand the heterogeneity between blastomeres and identify factors that may involve in cell lineage differentiation, single blastomeres from the mouse 4-cell embryo were separated and cultured to the morula stage. By using Smart-seq2 technology, we analyzed the gene expression pattern of the morulae, which developed from the 4-cell blastomeres (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). Hspa2 was identified by differential gene expression analysis and showed distinct mRNA levels among the four morulae (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). In addition, the level of <italic>Nanog</italic> and <italic>Hspa2</italic> mRNA showed stronger positive correlation (R=0.624) in gene expression than random gene pairs (R=0.029), indicating that <italic>Nanog</italic> expression levels increased with the increase of <italic>Hspa2</italic> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). When the late 2-cell embryo was divided into single blastomeres and cultured to the morula stage, we obtained similar results that <italic>Hspa2</italic> mRNA distinctly distributed between the two morulae (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1A, B</xref>). Next, we investigated the expression of <italic>Hspa2</italic> during preimplantation embryo development in whole embryos from meiosis II to the blastocyst stage. qRT-PCR analysis showed that the <italic>Hspa2</italic> mRNA was stored maternally at the MII oocyte and maintained at high level at the zygote stage (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1C</xref>).</p>

<p>To directly examine the heterogeneity among individual blastomeres, we separated 4-cell embryos into individual four blastomeres which were then analyzed by single-cell qRT-PCR and Jess TM Simple Western System based automated western immunoblotting with high sensitivity. The results showed that the mRNA and protein levels of HSPA2 differed among the four blastomeres (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>, E), and confirmed by fluorescence <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization (FISH) analysis (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>). We also identified heterogeneous HSPA2 expression during the late 2-cell stage (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G-I</xref>). For the early 2-cell stage, however, HSPA2 was symmetrically distributed between the two blastomeres (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1C-E</xref>). These results indicating that the heterogeneity occurred as early as the late 2-cell stage. Thus, we hypothesized that the heterogeneous distribution of HSPA2 in late 2-cell plays a direct or indirect role in the lineage commitment of early embryonic stages.</p>

<label>3.2</label><title>The reduced expression of <italic>Hspa2</italic> leads to the reduced expression of ICM-marker</title>
<p>To test our hypothesis, we knocked down the <italic>Hspa2</italic> mRNA level by injecting <italic>Hspa2</italic>-specific small interfering RNA (siRNA) into the cytoplasm of zygote, and NC-FAM (negative control with FAM label) siRNA-injected embryos served as the control (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). The differentially expressed genes were detected by RNA-seq for <italic>Hspa2</italic> siRNA (Knockdown; KD) and control (NC) groups at the 8-cell stage (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). In total, 96 up-regulated genes and 410 down-regulated genes were identified in the <italic>Hspa2</italic>-KD group when compared to the NC group (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>, D). To investigate the potential biological functions of the DEGs, we conducted GO and KEGG enrichment analysis. The most significant GO enriched terms were closely related to cell fate commitment, stem cell population maintenance, stem cell differentiation and blastocyst development (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>). According to KEGG analysis, the down-regulated genes were primarily associated with Hippo and Wnt signaling pathways (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>), which are known to play an important role in cell proliferation, differentiation, and fate decisions in embryonic development[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>]. Furthermore, the blastocyst formation rate in the <italic>Hspa2-KD</italic> group (52.96±2.489%) was significantly lower than that in the NC group (81.63±2.000%) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2G</xref>, H), thus suggesting that HSPA2 plays an essential role in preimplantation embryonic development. In addition, we found that the down-regulation of <italic>Hspa2</italic> resulted in a remarkable down-regulation of specific ICM-marker genes (<italic>Oct4</italic>, <italic>Sox2</italic> and <italic>Nanog</italic>) at the 4-cell and blastocyst stages. Meanwhile, the mRNA levels of a TE-marker gene, Cdx2, did not significantly change between the groups (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2I</xref>, J). We then used automated Western immunoblotting to detect the protein levels of ICM and TE markers in Hspa2-KD embryos, and found that the expression levels of ICM-marker proteins (OCT4 and SOX2) were inhibited when HSPA2 was down-regulated at the 4-cell and blastocyst stages, while the TE-marker protein CDX2 was not significantly different between the groups (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2K</xref>, L). Similarly, for mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) the knockdown of HSPA2 resulted in a significant reduction for the ICM-marker proteins, and no change for CDX2 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2M</xref>). These results suggest that HSPA2 plays a role in the regulation of ICM-specific gene expression.</p>

<label>3.3</label><title>The knockdown of <italic>Hspa2</italic> expression prevents blastomeres from an ICM fate</title>
<p>To investigate the functional role of HSPA2 in the first lineage segregation during early embryonic development, we examined the proportion of ICM and TE after Hspa2-KD. It was showed that the number of ICM and total cells in the blastocyst were significantly decreased, but the number of TE cells did not change significantly (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>, B). We then randomly co-injected green fluorescent protein (<italic>Gfp</italic>) mRNA with either <italic>Hspa2</italic>-siRNA or NC-FAM into one blastomere of the two-cell embryos to trace the fate of its descendent cells into the blastocyst (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>). Compared with the GFP+NC group (48.23%±7.415%), the GFP+<italic>Hspa2</italic>-KD group (33.75%±4.303%) exhibited a significantly reduced ratio of progeny cells with an ICM fate. Moreover, the number of ICM-marker OCT4 positive cells was found to be significantly reduced in the GFP+<italic>Hspa2</italic>-KD group (27.09±3.811%) than in the GFP+NC group (36.95%±2.524%) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>, E). This is consistent with our GO enriched terms of RNA-Seq in that the negative regulation of cell cycle, G1/S transition of mitotic cell cycle, mitotic cell cycle phase transition and regulation of mitotic cell cycle phase transition was found in <italic>Hspa2</italic>-KD group (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>).

<label>3.4</label><title>The overexpression of <italic>Hspa2</italic> does not induce blastomere cells to bias an ICM fate</title>
<p>To determine whether the redundant level of HSPA2 protein also affected first lineage segregation, we overexpressed <italic>Hspa2</italic> by microinjecting <italic>Hspa2</italic> mRNA (approximately 400ng/µL) into the zygote.

<label>3.5</label><title>HSPA2 interacts with CARM1 in the segregation of embryonic cell lineage</title>
<p>To further investigate the mechanism underlying the function of HSPA2 in cell fate decision during early embryonic development, we next analyzed differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) at the blastocyst stage in the <italic>Hspa2</italic>-KD and NC groups by applying untargeted proteomics. Volcano map screening identified a total of 43 annotated DEPs, of which 15 proteins were significantly up-regulated and 28 proteins were downregulated (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2A</xref>). These DEPs were mainly involved in post-translational modification by using Clusters of Orthologous Groups (COG)/Karyotic Orthologous Groups (KOG) functional annotation statistics (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2B</xref>). In order to compare the functional similarities and differences between proteins with different differential multiples, we divided the DEPs into four classifications: Q1 (&lt;0.5), Q2 (0.5-0.667), Q3 (1.5-2.0), and Q4 (&gt;2.0) according to differential expression multiples (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2C</xref>). Biological processes analysis showed that DEPs were associated with positive regulation of the Wnt signaling pathway and cellular development (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2D</xref>). In terms of the cellular component, the DEPs were related to the methylome and methyltransferase complex (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2E</xref>). These results indicated that the DEPs were mainly associated with the post-translational modification of proteins and cell fate decision.</p>
<p>Coactivator-associated arginine methyltransferase 1 (CARM1), also known as PRMT4, was the first protein arginine methyltransferase which was proved to be associated with transcriptional activation by methylating and/or regulating histone H3 and non-histone proteins, such as coactivators and transcription factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>]. Recent studies have demonstrated that CARM1 regulates early mouse development and plays a role in the determination of cell fate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>]. CARM1 levels, along with its specific histone marks (H3R17me2a and H3R26me2a), were found to vary among the four-cell blastomeres and that high levels of CARM1 led to increased levels of H3R26me. This varied distribution led to biased subsequent fate of the blastomeres towards the ICM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>]. Next, we considered whether HSPA2 regulates the decision of the first cell-fate through CARM1. Molecular docking experiments revealed that HSPA2 docked efficiently with CARM1 via several H-bonds and pi-interactions, with strong binding affinity (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). The Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes (STRING) database was used to predict interactions between HSPA2 and CARM1. The results showed that HSPA2, CARM1 and ICM-specific proteins interacted with each other (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2F</xref>). In addition, we found that the <italic>Hspa2</italic>-KD led to reduced CARM1 mRNA as well as protein levels at the 4-cell and blastocyst stages (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B-E</xref>). The knockdown of HSPA2 in mESCs also caused a significant reduction in the levels of CARM1 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5G</xref>).</p>

Moreover, we investigated whether HSPA2 could regulate H3R26me2 modification, a known event that occurs downstream of CARM1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>]. Immunofluorescence staining confirmed that CARM1-mediated H3R26me2 levels were significantly reduced in the interference group at the 4-cell stage (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5H</xref>). Collectively, our data demonstrated that HSPA2 involved in the segregation of embryonic cell lineage by forming a complex with CARM1 and through H3R26me2 modification.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>During the development of the fertilized eggs to blastocyst stage, the fundamental questions are to explain how the totipotent fertilized egg develops into different cell types and when cellular heterogeneity occurs. Previous studies demonstrated that molecular polarity and differential gene regulation by signaling pathways drive the first cell-fate decision in mammals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>]. The tracing of embryonic lineages from the 2-cell stage onwards by live embryo labeling demonstrated that the cellular heterogeneity is initiated early in the embryo, and thus was proposed as cellular heterogeneity hypothesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>]. H3R26me and its methyltransferase CARM1exhibit asymmetric expression patterns in the 4-cell stage of mouse embryos and plays an important role in regulating the first cell-fate decision. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>]. PRDM14 is also heterogeneously expressed in 4-cellstage mouse embryos and interacts with CARM1 to drive progenies towards pluripotent ICM fate by increasing the expression levels of H3R26me in 4-cell embryos [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>]. Despite the progress in our understanding of the mechanisms governing early cell fate decisions, many important questions still remain unanswered. We do not yet fully comprehend when the initial heterogeneities among cells arise and how are they translated into divergent patterns of gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>].</p>
<p>Although two-cell blastomeres are generally considered to be totipotent, the previous reports showing that when two-cell blastomeres are separated, in the majority of cases, only one of the two-cell blastomeres develops into a mouse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>]. In this study, we provide evidence that HSPA2 is asymmetrically expressed already in the late 2-cell stage and acts as an upstream factor of CARM1 to drive first cell-fate decision. We found that the expression levels of HSPA2 were symmetrically distributed between the two blastomeres at the early 2-cell stage, but showed heterogeneous distribution at the late 2-cell embryos. This indicates that the heterogeneity of HSPA2 at the late 2-cell embryo may be initiated concomitant with the zygotic genome activation (ZGA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>]. Alternatively, the asymmetry may be triggered by unequally distributed unknown factors that already existed in the early 2-cell embryos or the heterogeneous spatial distribution of maternal genes in the zygote. The reduced expression of HSPA2 led to the reduced expression levels of ICM-marker genes at both the mRNA and protein levels. Interfering with HSPA2 expression in one blastomere of the 2-cell embryos reduced the contribution of that blastomere to ICM differentiation. In addition, the number of ICM and total cells in the blastocyst was significantly reduced when compared to the control group (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>, E). We observed that the GO enriched terms were also closely related to negative regulation of cell cycle, G1/S transition of mitotic cell cycle, mitotic cell cycle phase transition and regulation of mitotic cell cycle phase transition (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>). HSPA2 knockdown via siRNA reduced cell proliferation and led to G1/S phase cell cycle arrest [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>]. It is possible that knockdown of HSPA2 results in lower cell number in ICM by interfering the cell cycle. Thus, HSPA2 has a role in ICM lineage establishment, although half of the ICM cells were able to survive with HSPA2 deficiency (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>).</p>
<p>However, the overexpression of HSPA2 did neither adversely affect embryo development and nor induce blastomere bias towards an ICM fate. It may be because that once the intracellular concentration of <italic>Hspa2</italic> reaches a threshold level, it was not able to control the target gene expression. Furthermore, we also found that HSPA2 interacted with CARM1, and reduced HSPA2 level, led to the reduced expression of CARM1, and thus reduced the levels of H3R26me2 modification at the 4-cell stage. Collectively, these results suggest that HSPA2 physically binds to CARM1 to activate ICM-specific gene expression through H3R26me2 modification (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5I</xref>).</p>
<p>Several probable mechanisms are compatible with the asymmetric hypothesis, including polarized cell division and differential gene regulation by signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>]. In fact, knock-down of HSPA2 also affected the Hippo and Wnt signaling pathways (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>). The Hippo signaling pathway has been shown to be responsible for polar cells being specified as ICM, whilst polar cells are specified as TE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>]. Besides, the Wnt signaling pathway directs cell proliferation, cell polarity, and cell fate determination during embryonic development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>].</p>
<p>In summary, our findings provide an exciting step forward for the first time that the role of HSPA2 in governing the first cell-fate decision in the mouse embryo lineage allocation. It may be beneficial for achieving a better understanding of embryogenesis patterns and cell differentiations.</p>

<p>This <bold>useful</bold> study by Gao et al identifies Hspa2 as a heterogeneous transcript in the early embryo and proposes a plausible mechanism showing interactions with Carm1. The authors propose that variability in HSPA2 levels among blastomeres at the 4-cell stage skews their relative contribution to the embryonic lineage. Given only 4 other heterogeneous transcripts/non-coding RNA have been proposed to act similarly at or before the 4-cell stage, this would be a key addition to our understanding of how the first cell fate decision is made. Whilst this is a <bold>solid</bold> study, in order to support its conclusions image analyses and quantifications would need to be better described, and the overexpression studies should be validated.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors investigate the role of HSPA2 during mouse preimplantation development. Knocking down HSPA2 in zygotes, the authors describe lower chances of developing into blastocysts, which show a reduced number of inner cell mass cells. They find that HSPA2 mRNA and protein levels show some heterogeneity among blastomeres at the 4-cell stage and propose that HSPA2 could contribute to skewing their relative contribution to embryonic lineages. To test this, the authors try to reduce HSPA2 expression in one of the 2-cell stage blastomere and propose that it biases their contribution to towards extra-embryonic lineages. To explain this, the authors propose that HSPA2 would interact with CARM1, which controls chromatin accessibility around genes regulating differentiation into embryonic lineage.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) The study offers simple and straightforward experiments with large sample sizes.</p>
<p>(2) Unlike most studies in the field, this research often relies on both mRNA and protein levels to analyse gene expression and differentiation.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) Image and statistical analyses are not well described.</p>
<p>(2) The functionality of the overexpression construct is not validated.</p>
<p>(3) Tracking of KD cells in embryos injected at the 2-cell stage with GFP is unclear.</p>
<p>(4) A key rationale of the study relies on measuring small differences in the levels of mRNA and proteins using semi-quantitative methods to compare blastomeres. As such, it is not possible to know whether those subtle differences are biologically meaningful. For example, the lowest HSPA2 level of the embryo with the highest level is much higher than the top cell from the embryo with the lowest level. What does this level mean then? Does this mean that some blastomeres grafted from strong embryos would systematically outcompete all other blastomeres from weaker embryos? That would be very surprising. I think the authors should be more careful and consider the lack of quantitative power of their approach before reaching firm conclusions. Although to be fair, the authors only follow a long trend of studies with the same intrinsic flaw of this approach.</p>
<p>(5) Some of the analyses on immunostaining do not take into account that this technique only allows for semi-quantitative measurements and comparisons.</p>
<p>
a) Some of the microscopy images are shown with an incorrect look-up table.</p>
<p>
b) Some of the schematics are incorrect and misleading.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this study, Gao et al. use RNA-seq to identify Hspa2 as one of the earliest transcripts heterogeneously distributed between blastomeres. Functional studies are performed using siRNA knockdown showing Hspa2 may bias cells toward the ICM lineage via interaction with the known methyltransferase CARM1.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This study tackles an important question regarding the origins of the first cell fate decision in the preimplantation embryo. It provides novelty in its identification of Hspa2 as a heterogeneous transcript in the early embryo and proposes a plausible mechanism showing interactions with Carm1. Multiple approaches are used to validate their functional studies (FISH, WB, development rates, proteomics). Given only 4 other transcripts/RNA have been identified at or before the 4-cell stage (LincGET, CARM1, PRDM14, HMGA1), this would be an important addition to our understanding of how TE vs ICM fate is established.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The RNA-seq results leading the authors to focus on Hspa2 are not included in the manuscript. This dataset would serve as an important resource but is neither included nor discussed. Nor is it mentioned whether Hspa2 was identified in prior RNA-seq embryos studies (for example Deng Science 2014).</p>
<p>In addition, the functional studies are centered on Hspa2 knockdown at the zygote (1-cell) stage, which would largely target maternal transcript. Given the proposed mechanism relies on Hspa2 heterogeneity post-ZGA (late 2-cell stage), the knockdown studies don't necessarily test this and thus don't provide direct support to the authors' conclusions. The relevance of the study would be improved if the authors could show that zygotic knockdown leads to symmetric Hspa2 levels at the late 2-cell and/or 4-cell stage. It may be possible that zygotic knockdown leads to lower global Hspa2 levels, but that asymmetry is still generated at the 4-cell stage.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the authors show that Hspa2 knockdown at the 1-cell stage lowers total Carm1 levels at the 4-cell stage. However, it is unclear how total abundance within the embryo alters lineage specification within blastomeres. The authors go on to propose a plausible mechanism involving Hspa2 and Carm1 interaction, but do not discuss how expression levels may be involved.</p>
