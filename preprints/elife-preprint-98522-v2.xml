<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Electrophysiology has proven invaluable to record neural activity, and the development of Neuropixels probes dramatically increased the number of recorded neurons. These probes are often implanted acutely, but acute recordings cannot be performed in freely moving animals and the recorded neurons cannot be tracked across days. To study key behaviors such as navigation, learning, and memory formation, the probes must be implanted chronically. An ideal chronic implant should (1) allow stable recordings of neurons for weeks; (2) allow reuse of the probes after explantation; (3) be light enough for use in mice. Here, we present the “Apollo Implant”, an open-source and editable device that meets these criteria and accommodates up to two Neuropixels 1.0 or 2.0 probes. The implant comprises a “payload” module which is attached to the probe and is recoverable, and a “docking” module which is cemented to the skull. The design is adjustable, making it easy to change the distance between probes, the angle of insertion, and the depth of insertion. We tested the implant across eight labs in head-fixed mice, freely moving mice, and freely moving rats. The number of neurons recorded across days was stable, even after repeated implantations of the same probe. The Apollo implant provides an inexpensive, lightweight, and flexible solution for reusable chronic Neuropixels recordings.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Some fundamental cognitive processes develop across days (e.g. learning) and are best studied in naturalistic environments (e.g. navigation). To gain insights into these processes, it is necessary to record brain activity chronically and to be able to do so in freely moving animals. Chronic recordings in freely moving animals are possible with calcium imaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Ghosh et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Zong et al., 2022</xref>). However, accessing deep brain regions can require invasive surgery and fails to capture fast neural dynamics. Electrophysiology overcomes these issues: the temporal resolution is higher, deeper regions are readily accessible, and recordings can be made in freely moving animals. Substantial effort has thus been dedicated to developing devices for chronic electrophysiology recordings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Berényi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Chung et al., 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Ferguson et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Ferreira-Fernandes et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Newman et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Okun et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Schoonover et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Shobe et al., 2015</xref>). But these devices are typically non-recoverable, are too heavy for use in smaller animals like mice, or record relatively few neurons.</p>
<p>With Neuropixels probes, many hundreds of neurons can be recorded in a single insertion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Jun et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Steinmetz et al., 2021</xref>). These probes allow experimenters to produce brain-wide maps of neural activity in head-restrained mice using acute recordings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Allen et al., 2019</xref>; International Brain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Laboratory et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Steinmetz et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Stringer et al., 2019</xref>). To track neurons across days, and to use freely moving animals, the probes can be implanted chronically, with procedures that are permanent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Jun et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Steinmetz et al., 2021</xref>) or recoverable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Ghestem et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Horan et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Juavinett et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Luo et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Song et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Steinmetz et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">van Daal et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Vöröslakos et al., 2021</xref>). Permanent implants are lightweight and stable, but their use at scale is not financially feasible. Conversely, recoverable implants can be reused, but solutions need to be cheaper, lighter, more flexible, and easier to implant and explant. In particular, the only published recoverable implants for Neuropixels 2.0 probes may be too heavy for use with typical mice, and cannot be adjusted for different implantation trajectories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Steinmetz et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">van Daal et al., 2021</xref>).</p>
<p>To address these issues, we developed the “Apollo implant” for the reversible chronic implantation of Neuropixels probes. The implant is named for its lunar module design: a recoverable payload module accommodates up to two Neuropixels probes and is reused across animals, and a docking module is permanently cemented to the skull during implantation. The design is open source and can be readily adjusted with editable parameters to change distance between probes, implantation depth, or angle of insertion.</p>
<p>Our eight independent laboratories have performed successful recordings with the Apollo implant in mice and rats, supporting the flexibility and simplicity of the design. The same Neuropixels probes have been reimplanted up to 6 times with no significant change in recording quality. Recordings were stable across weeks and sometimes months. This allows for recordings to cover the entirety of the probes (by recording from different sections across days), while minimizing set-up time, and could facilitate the tracking of neurons across days. The design has been independently printed, adjusted, and implanted across labs, and implanted subjects included freely behaving mice and rats and head-fixed mice, with Neuropixels 1.0, 2.0α (a pre-release version), and 2.0 probes.</p>

<title>Flexible design</title>
<p>The Apollo implant consists of two parts, the payload and the docking modules, inspired by previous designs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">van Daal et al., 2021</xref>) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). Both parts can be 3D-printed in a variety of materials, although we typically used a combination of Nylon PA12 and Formlabs Rigid Resin. The Neuropixels 1.0, 2.0α and 2.0 implants weigh ∼1.7, 1.3, and 0.9 g (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Payload modules can accommodate up to 2 parallel probes, with the second probe adding a further 0.4, 0.2, and 0.2 g. The Apollo implant is therefore ∼40% lighter than the only published Neuropixels 2.0α solution, which recommends animals are at least 25 g (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">van Daal et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Steinmetz et al., 2021</xref>). This allows for use in smaller animals (e.g. female and water-restricted mice). The electronics are protected by lids with slots to accommodate the flex cables when not connected to the headstage (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). To ensure the implant is maximally compact, flex cables can be folded into the cavity beneath the lids (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). This minimizes implant height (∼29, 21, and 17 mm for a Neuropixels 1.0, 2.0α and 2.0), reducing the moment of inertia above the head. The implant can be 3D-printed for ∼$10 (∼$3 for each disposable module).</p>

<caption><title>Implant weight depends on probe version and material.</title>
<p>The weight for each implant version. We find these to vary with each print (∼5 %), and with different services (∼10-15 %). For consistency, these weights are calculated from part volume and the material density. The “Standard” implant comprises PA12-Lids and Rigid4000-Payload/Docking modules. This is the most common implant used by experimenters, but the PA12-only implant has been used to reduce weight further. The total weights do not include the cement (∼0.2 g) to fix the probes to the payload module.</p></caption>

</table-wrap>
<p>The implant is flexible and recoverable, allowing for different configurations, and the same Neuropixels probe(s) to be used multiple times (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). Once the payload module is constructed, the distance between the two probes remains fixed. The docking module is connected to the payload module via small screws, which makes it easy to assemble, and disassemble upon explantation. Only the docking module is cemented to the animal’s skull, and it is covered with merlons to increase contact with the cement and therefore the stability of the implant. To facilitate different implantation depths and angles with the same payload module, both the length and base-angle of the docking module can be adjusted. The base of the implant thus remains parallel to the skull (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>) which improves stability and reduces weight by minimizing implant-height and the quantity of cement required. All adjustments can be achieved by inexpert CAD users with preset parameters supplied in the editable files to change distance between probes (1.8 to 6.5 mm—beyond 6.5 mm, two implants can be used), implantation depth (2-6.5 mm), or angle of insertion (up to 20 degrees) (Supplementary Video 1). As the fully-editable files are provided, users can (and have) adjusted the implants to exceed these default boundaries, or create their own custom modifications which are also available online (see Methods).</p>
<p>To help combine the payload and docking modules, we designed a dedicated constructor (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>). The docking holder, containing a new docking module, slides onto the constructor posts, and the payload holder, containing the payload module, is fixed to the end. The two modules are thus coaxial, and the docking module can slide into position and be secured to the payload module without risk of damaging the probes. The constructor comprises 3D-printed parts and Thorlabs 6 mm poles for a one-time cost of ∼$25.</p>

<title>Assembly and implantation</title>
<p>A comprehensive protocol for assembly and implantation, including variations employed across labs, is provided in Methods. Payload modules are assembled with one or two Neuropixels probes. After probe-sharpening (see Methods, <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 1A</xref>), an empty payload module was positioned on adhesive putty and coated with a thin layer of epoxy. The probe(s) can then be affixed and aligned to the payload module, either by eye or using graph paper, before covering the base and electronics with epoxy or dental cement (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). The flex cable was folded and inserted into the lid and lids were then glued to the payload module (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>The payload module (new or previously used) was combined with a new docking module for each experiment. Docking modules were adjusted to match experimental requirements (e.g. insertion depth, angle, etc.) The docking module was secured in its holder and slid onto the arms of the constructor. The payload module was secured in its holder and attached to the end of the constructor (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C-D</xref>). The docking module holder was then slid along the constructor arms, and the two modules were secured with screws (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>). Before each experiment, any gaps in the assembled implant were filled (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>). Prior to each implantation, probes were typically coated with fluorescent dye for post-experiment trajectory tracking (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 1B</xref>).</p>
<p>Craniotomies were performed on the same day as the implantation, but this could be any time after assembly (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>). The implant was held using the 3D-printed payload holder and positioned using a micromanipulator. The 8 shanks (in the case of a dual 4-shank implant) are positioned at the surface of the brain (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2G</xref>). Care is taken to avoid large blood vessels, and the implant can be rotated and repositioned. If the vessel is not completely avoidable, the shanks can be positioned on each side of the blood vessel. Probes were inserted to the desired depth at a slow speed (3-5 µm/s). Finally, to complete the implantation, the docking module was cemented to the skull (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2H</xref>).</p>

<sec id="s2c">
<title>Explantation</title>
<p>Explantations were performed with a payload holder attached to a micromanipulator. The holder was aligned to the payload module, slid into place, and secured with a screw. The screws between the payload and the docking modules were then removed, and the payload module extracted (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 1C</xref>). Probes were cleaned with a tergazyme-solution, occasionally followed by a silicone cleaning solvent if Dural-Gel stuck to the probe. The payload module was combined with a new docking module for subsequent experiments.</p>
<p>Across laboratories, 97% of probes were recovered without any broken shanks (61/63 explanted probes, Supplementary Table 1). In only two cases were probes damaged, and in one of those cases the skull integrity was compromised by infection (a rare occurrence) and the probe was likely broken before explantation. On 6 further occasions, probes stopped working due to connection errors (typically revealed by a “shift register” error in SpikeGLX). The recovery rate is therefore 86% when including all connection errors. However, as this type of error is also observed with acute probe use, and there was no observable damage to the chronic probes, these failures may reflect long-term wear rather than any issue with the implant. Consistent with this, probes that failed with this error had typically been used for several months (Supplementary Table 1). Outside of the originating laboratory (UCL), 95% of probes (19/20) were recovered without any broken shanks (90% when including all connection errors) demonstrating the ease with which new users adopt this design.</p>

<title>Stability</title>
<p>We tested the stability of the Apollo implant with Neuropixels 1.0, 2.0α, and 2.0 probes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). We implanted 48 mice using 4-shank Neuropixels 2.0α implants (20 mice with a single-probe implant and 13 mice with a dual implant), single-probe Neuropixels 2.0 implants (7 mice) and Neuropixels 1.0 implants (7 mice with a single probe implant and one mouse with a dual), as well as 3 rats with a single Neuropixels 1.0 implant (Supplementary Table 1). In many cases, the same implants were reused (up to 6 times) and remained fully functional across different animals (Supplementary Table 1). Recordings were performed over a period of days to months. The probes were typically inserted 5-6 mm inside the brain, traversing multiple brain regions (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A,B</xref>). Because only 384 of the 5120 channels, termed a “bank” of channels, can be recorded simultaneously on each 4-shank 2.0 probe, multiple recording sessions were often used to cover all recording sites located in the brain for. Compared with acute recordings, this strategy dramatically reduces experimental set-up time and complexity, and is especially beneficial for whole brain approaches. The raw signal quality did not seem to change across days (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C,D</xref>), allowing us to identify single spikes reliably for months. The spiking patterns on each probe were similar across days (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E,F</xref>), suggesting that the same populations of neurons were being tracked.</p>

<p>The number of recorded neurons was reasonably stable across weeks (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>, <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 3</xref>-<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). For each session, we quantified the number of well-isolated single units for each individual channel bank (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). Units were selected based on stringent criteria including amplitude, percentage of missing spikes, and refractory period violations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Fabre et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">van Beest et al., 2024</xref>). The number of single units for each probe is the sum of units across all banks within the brain (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). Unit numbers could remain stable for more than 50 days, and we observed comparable stability in most of mice (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>). As previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Luo et al., 2020</xref>), we often observed an initial fast decrease in the number of units, but this was not systematic. Indeed, in some animals, unit-number increased slowly across days until reaching a peak (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>). The mean decrease in unit count per day was ∼3% (median 2%), within the range previously observed for chronic Neuropixels implants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Steinmetz et al., 2021</xref>). Although implants with more rapid unit loss were not suited for long-term recordings, others remained stable for months. Across all banks, the average number of recorded neurons on each bank was 85 ± 6 during the first 10 days (n = 59 probes, mean ± s.e.m.), 65 ± 7 during days 10-50 (n = 50 probes), 54 ± 15 during days 50-100 (n = 6 probes) and 44 ± 25 beyond (n = 2 probes) (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 4</xref>). The initial number of units did not depend on the number of times the probe was reimplanted (p &gt; 0.25, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>) or the insertion coordinates of the probe (p &gt; 0.94, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>). The rate of unit loss was also independent of these two variables (p &gt; 0.29 and p &gt; 0.31 for probe reuse and AP position, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E,F</xref>). However, implant quality was more variable in posterior brain regions, with instances of rapidly decreasing neuron counts, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Luo et al., 2020</xref>). Stability was qualitatively similar across different laboratories (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 3</xref>). Surgical optimizations are ongoing, and protecting the craniotomy with silicon may significantly increase recording stability (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 5</xref>, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Melin et al., 2024</xref>)).</p>

<p>The overall quality of the signal remained high throughout days and probe reuses. We quantified the overall noise present in the recordings by computing the root-mean-square (RMS) value of the raw signal (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4G- L</xref>). The RMS values were stable across days, across all mice (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4G,H</xref>). Both the average RMS value and its changes over time were independent of the number of times the probe had been used (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4I,K</xref>). We observed a significant effect of AP position on the RMS value, but not on its changes over time (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4J,L</xref>). Similarly, the median unit amplitude was stable and unaffected by probe reuse (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 2</xref>).</p>
<p>Individual neurons could be tracked across days and months (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>). We used the tracking software UnitMatch to track the same units across days, based on their waveforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">van Beest et al., 2024</xref>). In a mouse recorded for ∼100 days, a significant fraction of units could be tracked for months (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A,B</xref>). Tracked neurons had stable waveforms over days, as expected from the matching procedure, but also stable inter-spike intervals histograms (ISIH) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C,D</xref>). These ISIHs were not used to match neurons across days, and their stability therefore strongly suggests the same units were tracked over months. The proportion of units tracked between two recordings decreased as a function of time between the recordings (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref>). For two recordings on the same day, ∼50% of neurons were matched, suggesting an upper limit in neuron-tracking with the method we used, likely due to variability in neural activity or conservative choices in software parameters. The proportion of tracked neurons typically decreased to ∼10% after 32 days, but the rate of decay varied across recordings: with some cases where 20% of neurons were tracked for 64 days, and others dropping to 0% after a week. In all cases, tracked units had consistent ISIHs, as measured by the area under the receiver operating characteristic Curve (AUC)—comparing the similarity of ISIHs for tracked vs. different units (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5F</xref>). This indicates the tracking algorithm remains accurate for large intervals between recordings.</p>

<title>Freely behaving animals</title>
<p>To test whether the Apollo implant could be used in more naturalistic conditions, we recorded from freely behaving mice and rats in various configurations (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>). First, to minimize the weight, we recorded from 2 freely-moving mice using either a dual Neuropixels 2.0α implant or a Neuropixels 1.0 implant, with the headstage suspended by its connection cable (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A,B</xref>). The mice explored their home cage and exhibited normal behaviors, such as grooming, running, and sleeping, suggesting that the implant did not impair basic movements. The recordings yielded high-quality, well-isolated single units for weeks (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>, <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 3</xref>). The distributions of the RMS values (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D</xref>) and spike amplitudes (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6E</xref>) were similar to the head-fixed conditions, suggesting an equivalent quality of recording despite differences in conditions, and labs. It can also be more convenient to secure the position of the headstage in each recording, or permanently attach the headstage to the implant. We thus designed a headstage holder, which we tested with Neuropixels 1.0 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6F-J</xref>). To further reduce the weight on the mouse, we also designed a 1-probe version of the implant for Neuropixels 2.0, with a minimal headstage holder (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6K-O</xref>), inserted at an angle (16 or 25 degrees), at the back of the brain. In rats (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6P-T</xref>), the implant was inserted in the center of a 3- D casing, that afforded extra protection, and neural data was recorded wirelessly using SpikeGadgets.</p>

<p>Mouse performance in the task remained stable after implantation (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>). To quantify the effect of implantation on behavior, we compared the performance of mice on a complex behavioral task before and after implantation with a Neuropixels 1.0 probe—the heaviest version of the Apollo Implant (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). This implant was modified to allow the headstage to be permanently attached from the first recording session (see Methods). Mice were placed in a large octagonal arena (80 cm diameter). On each trial, mice were required to respond to visual stimuli projected onto the floor of the chamber and perform a nose poke in one of the ports located around the perimeter of the chamber. Thus, during a typical session of ∼100 trials, mice typically traversed tens of meters (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A</xref>). We compared mouse hit rate, trial number, and reaction times in sessions before implantation (when the mouse moved entirely freely) and after implantation (when the mouse was tethered). After implantation, mice continued to perform trials and fully-explore the chamber (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7B</xref>). We observed an initial reduction in hit rate and trial number, and an increase in reaction time immediately after implantation (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7C-E</xref>). The first two measures recovered within 5 sessions (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7C-D</xref>), but reaction times did not recover to pre-implantation levels, indicating that implantation may impact mobility in physically demanding tasks. Although we cannot disambiguate whether these changes are due to tethering, or the implant, it represents the maximal impact of the implantation, particularly as the heaviest Apollo implant was used. Therefore, the consistent hit rate and trial number, in a complex task requiring exploration in a large arena, demonstrates that the implant is well-suited to extended recordings from freely moving mice.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>To record large populations of neurons across days and during freely moving behaviors we developed the “Apollo implant”: a chronic implant for Neuropixels 1.0 and 2.0 probes. This solution is easily implanted and recovered, inexpensive, lightweight, flexible, and stable. We successfully tested the implant across multiple labs, setups (head-fixed or freely moving), and species (mice and rats), recording neural populations across weeks and even months.</p>
<p>The design of the Apollo implant builds upon past advances in chronic devices for Neuropixels probes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Juavinett et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Luo et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Steinmetz et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">van Daal et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Vöröslakos et al., 2021</xref>) to improve on several aspects: weight, price, flexibility, and ease of use. The implant is optimized for animals that cannot carry heavy loads, like mice and especially female and water-controlled mice, which have lower body weight. Because the headstage is not permanently fixed to the implant, the animal carries less weight outside of recordings, and a single headstage can be used with multiple animals in sequence. However, the flexible design allows for the headstage to be permanently attached to an implant, which increases experimental ease at the expense of some additional implant-weight. The implant is strong enough to be carried by rats with the addition of a protective 3D outer casing (see Methods), but its use in stronger animals, like ferrets or primates, remains untested. For applications requiring even lighter implants, such as birds, printing materials can be selected to further reduce weight. The lightweight design enables animals to perform complex and demanding freely moving tasks, but also allows experimenters to implant female and water restricted mice while respecting animal welfare weight limitations.</p>
<p>The Apollo implant is more flexible than previously published solutions. A unique aspect of our modular design is that different docking modules can be used when reimplanting the same payload module, which enables a variety of recording configurations (brain regions, animals, and experimental setups) that would not have been possible with previous designs. The provided CAD files are fully editable and open source, allowing experienced users to modify the parts as needed. For inexpert users, the files are populated with predefined key dimensions that can be easily adjusted to accommodate changes in several features, including inter-probe distance, angle of implantation, and the length of exposed probes. This ensures the implant remains close to the skull for each experiment, minimizing surgical complications, implant weight (less bonding agent is needed), and moment of inertia (height is minimized). Indeed, even with the heavier Neuropixels 1.0 implants, freely-moving mice maintained consistent performance on a complex task after implantation.</p>
<p>Although adapting the design to other commercially available silicon probes is beyond the scope of this study, the flexible design paves the way for future adaptations by individual groups. Because of the low component-cost (∼$3 per docking module), testing custom modifications is also more cost-effective than with previous solutions. This combination of flexibility and affordability is exemplified by the modifications already used across the eight labs providing data for this manuscript.</p>
<p>With the Apollo implant, the number of recorded neurons exhibited good stability across days, regardless of the number of times the probe had been reimplanted. To provide a realistic estimate for the number of high-quality units that could be recorded across days, we used stringent quality metrics based on unit waveform and spiking properties. Predicting the stability of an implantation was difficult and did not seem to correlate strongly with the quality of surgery (e.g. a small bleed during craniotomy, or ease of probe insertion). We observed more variable stability at the back of the brain, especially in superior colliculus, possibly due to the mechanical constraints imposed during head movements.</p>
<p>The Apollo implant allows for the insertion of up to two parallel probes simultaneously. This can be advantageous: it simplifies surgeries by reducing insertion time and allows probes to be placed in close proximity. However, some users may need to insert multiple probes at different angles. In this case we are aware of two implant solutions in development that could be better suited, although to our knowledge these remain untested outside the authors’ own groups and have only been used in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Aery Jones, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Melin et al., 2024</xref>).</p>
<p>We have demonstrated that neurons recorded with the Apollo implant can be effectively tracked across days, consistent with previous characterizations of chronic Neuropixels implants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Steinmetz et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">van Beest et al., 2024</xref>). Van Beest <italic>et al</italic> provides further evidence of neurons tracked with the Apollo implant, and a rigorous quantification of the number of neurons that one can expect to track with these methods. We expect the success of these methods to vary across model systems due to differences in waveform properties—for example, we observed qualitatively higher unit amplitudes in rats in this study. The ability to track neurons across these timescales promises to enhance our understanding of cognitive processes that evolve over long timescales, such as learning or aging.</p>
<p>Overall, the Apollo implant fills an important need to facilitate chronic electrophysiology with Neuropixels probes, particularly in small animals. The simplicity and flexibility of its design is exemplified by the 8 independent groups that have successfully used the implant and contributed data to this manuscript.</p>

<title>Implant design and materials</title>
<p>All parts of the implant (except the constructor probes, Thorlabs) were designed using Autodesk Inventor Professional 2023 software, acquired free of charge through the renewable education plan. Parts were 3D- printed by external companies (primarily SGD 3D, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sgd3d.co.uk/">https://sgd3d.co.uk/</ext-link>), or at the SWC FabLab. Stereolithography (SLA, using Rigid4000 resin, Formlabs) was typically used for the payload and docking modules, the docking holder, and the constructor head. Selective laser sintering (SLS, using Nylon PA12) was typically used for the payload module lids and payload holder. Brass threaded inserts were manually added to the payload module, payload holder, and docking holder using a soldering iron after printing. For parts (e.g. the payload and docking modules) where strength and inflexibility were advantageous, we used Rigid4000 resin, although this material is denser than Nylon PA12. With this combination, the Neuropixels 1.0, 2.0α and 2.0 implants weigh ∼1.7, 1.3, and 0.9 g. The weight of the implants can be further reduced to ∼1.5, 1.1, and 0.8 g if all parts are printed with Nylon PA12. The full-PA12 implants have been successfully used with 1.0 probes, but remains untested with the 2.0 versions. The miniaturized Neuropixels 2.0 implant with headstage holder weighed ∼0.6 g by itself or 1.1g with the probe epoxied and ground attached. All probes used, and any resulting issues/breakages are detailed in Supplementary Table 1. Damage resulting from historical procedural steps that are no-longer used (e.g. manually separating the shanks of a 4-shank probe with a needle, now achieved by de-ionized water or strong solvant) or carelessness during probe handling outside of mounting, implantation and explantation are not indicated in the table as they are independent of the implant itself.</p>

<title>Implant assembly, implantation, and explantation protocol</title>
<p>What follows is the protocol used by the originating laboratory with some minor variants. This is the most thoroughly tested and recommended approach. Methods employed by each individual lab are detailed in a later section.</p>
<sec id="s5b1">
<label>1.</label><title>Payload module assembly—Once per Apollo Implant</title>
<p>The payload modules were assembled with either one or two shank Neuropixels probes. First, all parts were assembled by hand without the probes to ensure a good fit first before fixing the probes permanently to the holder.</p>
<list list-type="order">
<list-item><p>The probes were sharpened individually using a microgrinder (Narishige EG-45), and an independent holder (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 1A</xref>). When using only one probe, sharpening can be performed at the end of the assembly, using the payload module holder.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The empty payload module was positioned on adhesive putty (Blu Tack) and coated with a thin layer of epoxy (Araldite or Gorilla) or dental cement (Superbond).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The probe was affixed and aligned to the payload module, either by eye or using graph paper, before covering the base and electronics with epoxy or dental cement (e.g. Loctite E-60NC HYSOL or Superbond, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>In the case of a dual implant, the second probe was similarly affixed on the other side of the payload module (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). The relative position of each probe was adjusted by eye to achieve the required combination of depths.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The ground and reference were shorted by connecting them with a silver wire. Occasionally, this wire was then soldered to a socket connector to flexibly connect the ground to a bone screw.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>For each probe, the flex cable was folded and inserted into the slot on the inside of the lid (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>) before the lid was glued to the payload module with superglue (Loctite) or dental cement (SDI, Wave A1) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Any residual openings were filled in with Kwik-Cast (WPI). When only one probe was used, the back side of the payload was sealed by a lid, with masking tape or a small drop of Kwik-Cast.</p></list-item>
</list>
</sec>
<sec id="s5b2">
<title>Combining payload and docking modules</title>
<p>For each implantation, a new or previously used payload module was combined with a new docking module. The docking module could be varied between experiments to adjust for variables including insertion depth, angle, or headplate-compatibility.</p>
<list list-type="order">
<list-item><p>The docking module was positioned in the docking module holder, secured with set screws (M3 10mm), and slid onto the arms of the constructor.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The payload module (with probes) was secured in a payload module holder by tightening the corresponding screw (M3 20 mm) and attached to the end of the constructor with screws (M3 10mm, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The docking module holder was slid along the constructor arms toward the payload module, and the two modules were combined with screws (M1 x 2mm, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Any open gaps were closed with Kwik-Cast (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Before most implantations, probes were coated with DiI (Vybrant V22888 or V22885, ThermoFisher) or DiD (Vybrant V22887, ThermoFisher) by either manually brushing each probe with a droplet of DiI or dipping them directly into the solution (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 1B</xref>).</p></list-item>

<sec id="s5b3">
<title>Implantation</title>
<p>Craniotomies were performed on the day of the implantation, under isoflurane (1–3% in O2) anesthesia, and after injection of appropriate analgesia and anti-inflammatory drugs (usually Colvasone and Carprofren). Headplate surgery was performed in most cases, either days before or on the same day. The eyes of the animal were protected throughout surgery using eye lubricant.</p>
<list list-type="order">
<list-item><p>The skull was cleaned, scored (to improve cement adhesion), and levelled. One craniotomy per probe was then performed using a drill or a biopsy punch (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>). Craniotomies were as small as possible (&lt;0.5mm for single shank, 1mm of length for 4 shanks), while still allowing for room to adjust probe placement (particularly important with dual, 4-shank probe implants).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The exposed brain was covered with Dural-Gel (Cambridge Neurotech) which was allowed to cure for 15-30 minutes. This step can be performed after probe insertion <italic>if</italic> the brain is suffused with saline throughout insertion.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>(Optional) A skull screw was inserted into the skull for grounding during recordings.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The assembled implant—secured within a payload holder—was positioned using a micromanipulator (Sensapex). After positioning the probe shanks at the surface of the brain (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2G</xref>), avoiding blood vessels, probes were inserted at slow speed (3-5 µm/s).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Once the desired depth was reached (generally when the docking module touched the skull), the implant was sealed using cement (3M RelyX Unicem 2 Automix) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2H</xref>). Occasionally, silicone gel or Kwik-Sil was on top of the Dural-Gel to improve stability. Preliminary data from one mouse where this was performed shows excellent stability (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 5</xref>).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>(Optional) The skull screw was connected to the probe’s reference/ground wire and secured with a drop of cement. During head-fixed experiments, the animal’s headplate can be used for grounding, and combined with internal referencing provided by the Neuropixels, yielded low-noise recordings.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Probe function, and in some cases position in the brain, were confirmed by plugging the probes into the acquisition system and visually inspecting the signals.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The docking module, skull screw (optional), and skull were covered with Super-Bond polymer, taking care to ensure the payload module (and screws) were not cemented.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>(Optional) In some cases, a headstage was combined with the implant. In this case, a cap/cover was fitted to the implant to protect and hold the headstage. A connection between the headstage and acquisition hardware was confirmed before removing the animal from anesthesia.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>(Optional) In rats, a SpikeGadgets targeting cone shielding was assembled around the Apollo implant and affixed to the skull with self-curing orthodontic resin (Ortho-jet, Lang Dental). The probe flex cable was connected to the Spike Gadgets interface board and screws were placed to hold the interface board to the targeting cone assembly, completing the implantation.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>At the end of the surgery, the animal was given analgesia (Metacam), and allowed to awaken on the heating mat before being placed in a heated recovery box and then returned to its home cage.</p></list-item>
</list>
</sec>
<sec id="s5b4">
<title>Explantation</title>
<p>Explantations were performed under light isoflurane anesthesia (1–3% in O2).</p>
<list list-type="order">
<list-item><p>With a micromanipulator, a payload holder was aligned to the payload module, slid into place, and secured with a screw. Ensure the animal’s head is well aligned to avoid any friction when retracting the probe.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The headstage (if present) was disconnected, and any residual silicon was removed. If a skull screw was used, the attached ground wire was unplugged or cut.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Saline was applied to the implant to soften any potential debris or tissue regrowth.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The screws between the payload and the docking modules were removed.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The payload module was retracted from the docking module using the micromanipulator. In cases where the implant was stiff, a needle or the tip of forceps was used to gently separate the two modules, to hold the docking module in place while the payload was retracted.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Once extracted, probes were sometimes contaminated with debris, like Dural-Gel or biological tissue (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 1C</xref>). Extensive cleaning with a Tergazyme solution (24h) followed by de-ionized water typically cleaned the probes. If this procedure proved insufficient, a 24h bath in a stronger detergent (DOWSIL DS-2025 Silicone cleaning solvent) removed the residual tissue. Neither process altered the signal quality.</p></list-item>

<p><bold>Preparatory surgery timing</bold>: different day than implantation</p>
<p><bold>Preparatory surgery</bold>: A brief (approximately 1 h) initial surgery was performed to implant a titanium headplate (approximately 25 × 3 × 0.5 mm, 0.2 g). In brief, the dorsal surface of the skull was cleared of skin and periosteum. A thin layer of cyanoacrylate (VetBond, World Precision Instruments) was applied to the skull and allowed to dry. Thin layers of UV-curing optical glue (Norland Optical Adhesives #81, Norland Products) were applied and cured until the exposed skull was covered. This glue was completely removed during the implantation surgery. The head plate was attached to the skull over the interparietal bone with Super-Bond polymer (Super-Bond C&amp;B, Sun Medical). After recovery, mice were treated with carprofen for three days, then acclimated to handling and head-fixation.</p>

<p><bold>Preparatory surgery</bold>: In brief, the skull was exposed, cleaned, and aligned in preparation for the implantation. A small craniotomy was performed at the target site. A small well was made around the craniotomy using blue-light-curing dental cement (3M RelyX Unicem 2 Automix). The well was filled with Dural-Gel to set before the implantation. The skin was glued, and the exposed skull was fully covered using dental cement (Superbond, SUN medical). Another small craniotomy (0.5 mm) was performed at the cerebellum, and previously prepared golden pin terminating with a silver wire was inserted and cemented such that the pin was resting on top of the skull.</p>
<p><bold>Craniotomy methods (size):</bold> Drill, then covered with Dural-Gel (∼1mm)</p>
<p><bold>Insertion speed (manipulator)</bold>: For the first 100-200um the lowering speed was ∼10-20um/s, then reduced to 3-5 µm/s for a subsequent ∼4000um (S-IVM Mini, Scientifica, mounted on the stereotaxic manipulator arm).</p>
<p><bold>Implant cementing</bold>: Blue-light-curing dental cement (3M RelyX Unicem 2 Automix). The grounding wire socket was plugged into the implanted grounding pin and cured with Light-curing cement. The implant was wrapped with surgical tape (3M micropore).</p>

<p><bold>Preparatory surgery</bold>: Mice were separated for at least 2 days prior to surgery. The mouse was secured on a stereotaxic frame (Angle Two, Leica Biosystems). After incision, the skull was roughened, and a small craniotomy was made away from the site of implantation and a ground pin inserted. The ground pin, prepared before surgery, consisted of a gold pin soldered to a short piece of silver wire (0.37mm diameter) that was inserted into the brain. Next a craniotomy was made, a small well was made around the craniotomy using blue-light-curing cement (3M RelyX Unicem 2 Automix). The dura was removed.</p>

<p><bold>Preparatory surgery timing</bold>: At least 3 days before implantation</p>
<p><bold>Preparatory surgery</bold>: Headplates (3D-printed RIVETS headplate, 0.54 g, VeroClear resin, 3D Bureau) were implanted during an initial surgery. In brief, the dorsal surface of the skull was cleared of skin and periosteum. A thin layer of cyanoacrylate (VetBond, World Precision Instruments) was applied to the skull and allowed to dry. After ensuring the skull was properly aligned within the stereotax, craniotomy sites were marked by tattoo ink using a sterile pipette tip. Edges of the exposed skull and headplate were scored by a scalpel to improve adhesion, then the headplate was attached to the skull using cyanoacrylate (Super Glue Power Gel, Loctite) and dental cement (Paladur, Heraeus Kuzler). The skull was then covered by another layer of cyanoacrylate (Super Glue Liquid Precision, Loctite) and allowed to dry.</p>
<p><bold>Craniotomy methods (size):</bold> Cyanoacrylate on the skull was removed by a hand-held dental drill, and a small craniotomy was drilled, then covered with Dural-Gel (0.1mm)</p>

<p><bold>Preparatory surgery timing</bold>: Just before implantation</p>
<p><bold>Preparatory surgery</bold>: In brief, the skull was exposed, cleared of connective tissue and periosteum, and leveled. A 1.8 mm trephine (Fine Science catalog #18004-18) was used to lightly inscribe the implant coordinates, and burr holes were drilled to accommodate four stainless steel anchor screws (McMaster-Carr catalog #92470A015) and the grounding screw (placed above the cerebellum). The craniotomy was drilled using the trephine, exposing the dura mater which was removed using a 27-ga needle and fine forceps.</p>
<p><bold>Craniotomy methods (size):</bold> Trephine (1.8mm)</p>
<p><bold>Insertion speed (manipulator)</bold>: 1-3 µm/s</p>
<p><bold>Implant cementing</bold>: The base of the docking module was previously covered with silicon, then Metabond was applied to the docking module to affix it to the skull and the anchor screws, and the ground pins were connected. Next, the Spike Gadgets targeting cone shielding was assembled around the Apollo implant and affixed to the skull with self-curing orthodontic resin (Ortho-jet, Lang Dental). The probe flex cable was connected to the Spike Gadgets interface board and screws were placed to hold the interface board to the targeting cone assembly, completing the implantation.</p>
<p><bold>Treatment</bold>: Carprofen during implantation, then carprofen for 3 days after surgery, and cephalexin for 14 days after surgery.</p>

<p><bold>Experimental context</bold>: Assisted rotary joint (Doric, AHRJ-OE_1×1_24_HDMI+4) was used to remove cable rotation throughout the recording session. During the recordings, water restricted mice were tethered and placed in a large (∼80 cm wide) octagonal arena (built in collaboration with NeuroGears Ltd) and were performing a behavioral task. Briefly, the floor of the arena was used as a projection surface to display the stimuli to the mice. At the bottom of each wall the nose-pokes were used to detect mouse responses and deliver water reward. At a random time after the trial onset, two stimuli were presented as a spatial cue on the floor, indicating which wall had an “active” nose poke with available water reward. To cue the relevant wall, each stimulus was in shape of a triangular “slice” on the arena floor, with the wide base along the width of the wall that had active pokes, narrowing down to a point at the center. The walls with active ports (2/8 walls) were randomized on trial-by-trial basis, and the distances mice had to take to reach the cued walls depended on their position at the trial onset. Mouse reaction times were measured as the elapsed time from the onset of the stimulus until the registration of the poke-response at a cued wall. Mouse performance (hit rate) was calculated as the percentage of trials mice poked to one of the cued walls within 30s. If the mouse did not poke within 30s, the trial was aborted and labelled as a miss trial. Sessions typically lasted 25-30 minutes (85-100 trials), or until mice began to miss responding to the cued walls.</p>
<p>Mouse position in the arena was recorded with a camera (50Hz, BFS-U3-16S2M-CS, Flir) and detected online by thresholding of mice against the arena floor, based on the region of interest, size, and intensity (Bonsai, Lopes et al., 2015). To increase detectability, IR light strips were added around the arena. Artefacts in tracking due to the tether were filtered out by removing frames with displacements larger than 73.35 cm and using a manual threshold based on the distribution of length of major axis of the tracked object.</p>

<p><bold>Experimental context</bold>: The animal was briefly anaesthetised (4% isoflurane) to connect the probe ground to the skull screw pin, the probe headstage at the ZIF connector, and the recording cable to the headstage at the Omnetics connector. In the first animal, a small loop (∼5 cm) of recording cable was fastened to the side of the implant using parafilm (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>) to ensure forces exerted on the cable were transmitted to the body of the implant and not the fragile ZIF connector. In the second animal, a custom-made headstage holder (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/Coen-Lab/chronic-neuropixels/tree/main/XtraModifications/Mouse_FreelyMoving">https://github.com/Coen-Lab/chronic-neuropixels/tree/main/XtraModifications/Mouse_FreelyMoving</ext-link>) was 3D-printed to attach to the implant assembly and secured the headstage onto the implant while protecting the ZIF connector. The entirety of the recording cable was attached to a nylon cable using knots of nylon thread spaced at ∼ 30 cm intervals along the recording cable. The cable was slack relative to the nylon thread so that the animal could freely explore and rotate without introducing excessive tension and knotting into the cable (Aery Jones, 2023). The animal was allowed to recover and freely navigate its home cage (for implant 1; Techniplast GM500, 39×20 cm) or an experimental arena (for implant 2; Techniplast GR900, 40×35 cm), located inside a small Faraday container or on the floor of the recording room. During recording sessions, the experimenter rotated the cable to match the animal’s rotational movements, to propagate twists along the full length of the cable and reduce localized tangling and cable stress near the implant.</p>

One mouse (GB012) was spike-sorted using Kilosort 4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Pachitariu et al., 2024</xref>).</p>
<p>A variety of parameters were used to select high-quality units, based either on their waveform and their spiking properties.</p>
<p>The template waveform-based criteria were: (1) a maximum of 2 peaks and 1 trough, (2) a spatial decay slope below −3 µV.µm<sup>-1</sup>, defined as the slope of a linear fit (using the MATLAB <italic>polyfit</italic> function) between the maximum absolute amplitude of the peak channel and nearest 5 channels along the length of the probe (i.e., 75µm away for Neuropixels 2.0), (3) a duration between 0.1ms and 0.8ms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Deligkaris et al., 2016</xref>), (4) fluctuations during baseline not exceeding 30% of the peak amplitude. The raw waveform-based criteria, computed using at least 1000 randomly sampled spikes, were: (1) a minimum mean amplitude of 20 µV (Only 1% of units had amplitudes below 30 µV, and increasing this threshold to 50 µV did not affect the results), and (2) a minimum mean signal-to-noise ratio of 0.1, defined as the absolute maximum value divided by the baseline variance. Both somatic and non-somatic spikes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Deligkaris et al., 2016</xref>) were kept.</p>
<p>The spiking properties-based criteria were: (1) a minimum of 300 spikes, (2) less than 20% of spikes missing, estimated by fitting a Gaussian to the spike amplitude distribution with an additional cut-off parameter below which no spikes are present, (3) a maximum of 10% refractory period violations, using a previously published approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Hill et al., 2011</xref>), defining the censored period as 0.1ms and estimating the refractory period using a window between 0.5 and 10ms, and (4) a minimum presence ratio of 0.2, defined as the fraction of 1-min bins with at least one spike.</p>

<title>Data analysis</title>
<p>Raw traces (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C,D</xref>, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>) were obtained by bandpass filtering each channel from spikeGLX between 400 and 9000 Hz (using the MATLAB <italic>bandpass</italic> function) and subtracting the median across channels. The root-mean-square (RMS) value was computed on the processed signal, and the median across all channels was used to summarize each recording.</p>
<p>To obtain the total number of spikes per second at each depth along the probe (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E,F</xref>), we summed spikes across all units present within each 20 µm depth bin.</p>
<p>In the case of 4-shank probes, we estimated the number of recorded units for a probe on a given day (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A,B</xref>) by summing units from a complete set of independently recorded banks—a set of channel banks that tiled the entirety of the implanted probe—when available. Because each such set was recorded across at least two days, we used the closest recordings within a window of five days, centered on the day of interest. Days were excluded if it was not possible to form a complete set of banks within a five-day window.</p>
<p>To obtain <italic>P</italic> the percentage change in unit count <italic>N<sub>d</sub></italic> across days <italic>d</italic> (4C-F), we fit an exponential decay function to the number of units detected on each bank across days and extracted the decay parameter <italic>τ</italic>:
<disp-formula>
<graphic xlink:href="551752v4_ueqn1.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula>
<italic>P</italic> was defined as:
<disp-formula>
<graphic xlink:href="551752v4_ueqn2.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula>
<italic>P</italic> was averaged across all longitudinally recorded banks from each implantation to obtain a single value. Only banks with at least 3 recordings were included.</p>
<p>The median of the units’ amplitude and the median RMS values were fitted using a linear fit. Similarly, a single value for each implantation was obtained by taking the variable’s mean value across all banks.</p>
<p>To estimate the effect of repeated probe use, <italic>U</italic>, and antero-posterior and medio-lateral insertion coordinates (<italic>Y</italic> and <italic>X</italic>) on a variable of interest (e.g., the percentage change in unit count, or the RMS values) across days, we used a linear mixed effects model (using the MATLAB <italic>fitlme</italic> function):
<disp-formula>
<graphic xlink:href="551752v4_ueqn3.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula>
Here, <italic>P</italic> is the response variable, <italic>Y</italic>, <italic>X</italic>, and <italic>U</italic> are fixed effect terms, and probeID (the probe identity) is the single grouping variable. We then assessed whether <italic>Y</italic>, <italic>X</italic>, or <italic>U</italic> had a significant effect on the response variable.</p>
<p>To track neurons across days (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>), we used UnitMatch, which uses only the neurons’ waveform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">van Beest et al., 2024</xref>). We identified cell presence across days using the intermediate algorithms, which have been shown to maximize the probability of tracking neurons while preserving a low false-positive rate. We then identified the neurons that were tracked across 6 arbitrary days spanning the whole recording period. The inter-spike intervals were computed as the distribution of the times between consecutive spikes, binned on a logarithmic scale from 0 to 5 s. As in van Beest et al (2023), to compute the probability of a unit being tracked, we looked at each unit across all recordings and computed the probability of this unit being tracked in previous or subsequent recordings. These probabilities were then averaged across all the units from each animal, and averaged across animals.</p>
<p>To quantify the amount of information present in the distributions of the correlations of the fingerprints, we computed the ROC curve for different populations of pairs (from putative matched units or nonmatched units) across days. We then computed the area under the ROC curve (AUC) to quantify this difference between distributions. Only sessions with at least 20 matched units were considered. Units that had a match within recordings were excluded from this analysis. For each mouse, the AUCs were then averaged across recording locations.</p>
<p>To compute the distributions of RMS values and unit-amplitudes (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>), we computed these distributions first for single sessions (across channels and units respectively), and then computed the average distribution across sessions and animals.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This work by Bimbard et al., introduces a new implant for Neuropixels probes. While Neuropixels probes have critically improved and extended our ability to record the activity of a large number of neurons with high temporal resolution, the use of these expensive devices in chronic experiments has so far been hampered by the difficulty of safely implanting them and, importantly, to explant and reuse them after conclusion of the experiment. The authors present a newly designed two-part implant, consisting of a docking and a payload module, that allows for secure implantation and straightforward recovery of the probes. The implant is lightweight, making it amenable for use in mice and rats, and customizable. The authors provide schematics and files for printing of the implants, which can be easily modified and adapted to custom experiments by researchers with little to no design experience. Importantly, the authors demonstrate the successful use of this implant across multiple use cases, in head-fixed and freely moving experiments, in mice and rats, with different versions of Neuropixels probes and across 8 different labs. Taken together, the presented implants promise to make chronic Neuropixels recordings and long-term studies of neuronal activity significantly easier and attainable for both current and future Neuropixels users.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
- The implants have been successfully tested across 8 different laboratories, in mice and rats, in head-fixed and freely moving conditions and have been adapted in multiple ways for a number of distinct experiments.</p>
<p>
- Implants are easily customizable and authors provide a straightforward approach for customization across multiple design dimensions even for researchers not experienced in design.</p>
<p>
- The authors provide clear and straightforward descriptions of the construction, implantation and explant of the described implants.</p>
<p>
- The split of the implant into a docking and payload module makes reuse even in different experiments (using different docking modules) easy.</p>
<p>
- The authors demonstrate that implants can be re-used multiple times and still allow for high-quality recordings.</p>
<p>
- The authors show that the chronic implantations allow for the tracking of individual neurons across days and weeks (using additional software tracking solutions), which is critical for a large number of experiments requiring the description of neuronal activity, e.g. throughout learning processes.</p>
<p>
- The authors show that implanted animals can even perform complex behavioral tasks, with no apparent reduction in their performance.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this manuscript, Bimbard and colleagues describe a new implant apparatus called &quot;Apollo Implant&quot;, which should facilitate recording in freely moving rodents (both mice and rats) using Neuropixels probes. The authors collected data from both mice and rats, they used 3 different versions of Neuropixels, multiple labs have already adopted this method, which is impressive. They openly share their CAD designs and surgery protocol to further facilitate the adaptation of their method.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Overall, the &quot;Apollo Implant&quot; is easy to use and adapt, as it has been used in other laboratories successfully and custom modifications are already available. The device is reproducible using common 3D printing services and can be easily modified thanks to its CAD design (the video explaining this is extremely helpful). The weight and price are amazing compared to other systems for rigid silicon probes allowing a wide range of use of the &quot;Apollo Implant&quot;.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The &quot;Apollo Implant&quot; can only handle Neuropixels probes. It cannot hold other widely used and commercially available silicon probes. Certain angles and distances may be better served by 2 implants.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>Weak emphasis on what can be enabled with this new method that didn't exist before.</p>
<p>We thank the reviewer for highlighting the limited discussion around scientific impact. Our implant has several advantages which combine to make it much more accessible than previous solutions. This enables a variety of recording configurations that would not have been possible with previous designs, facilitating recordings from a wider range of brain regions, animals, and experimental setups. In short, there are three key advances which we now emphasise in the manuscript:</p>
<p>Adaptability: The CAD files can be readily adapted to a wide range of configurations (implantation depth, angle, position of headstage, etc.). Labs have already modified the design for their needs, and re-shared with the community (Discussion, Para 5).</p>
<p>Weight: Because of the lightweight design, experimenters can i) perform complex and demanding freely moving tasks as we exemplify in the manuscript, and ii) implant female and water restricted mice while respecting animal welfare weight limitations (Flexible design, Para 1).</p>
<p>Cost: At ~$10, our implant is significantly cheaper than published alternatives, which makes it affordable to more labs and means that testing modifications is cost-effective (Discussion, Para 4).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer 1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>- Differences between mice and rats seem very significant. Although this is probably not surprising, I suggest that the authors comment on this to make it clear to anyone trying to use in different species that are not quantified in the main figures.</p>

<p>The reviewer is correct—there are qualitative differences between mice and rats, particularly with respect to the unit median amplitude. We have added a comment in the discussion to highlight these inter-species variations (Discussion, Para 7)</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>- Another comment that would be useful to have would be how to tackle the problem of tracking the same neuron across days. Even if currently impossible, it could be useful to provide discussion along those lines as to where future improvements (either in hardware or software) can be made.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for highlighting this. Figure. 5 does show data from tracking the same neuron across days (and even months). We have modified the language to make this clear.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This work by Bimbard et al., introduces a new implant for Neuropixels probes. While Neuropixels probes have critically improved and extended our ability to record the activity of a large number of neurons with high temporal resolution, the use of these expensive devices in chronic experiments has so far been hampered by the difficulty of safely implanting them and, importantly, to explant and reuse them after conclusion of the experiment. The authors present a newly designed two-part implant, consisting of a docking and a payload module, that allows for secure implantation and straightforward recovery of the probes. The implant is lightweight, making it amenable for use in mice and rats, and customizable. The authors provide schematics and files for printing of the implants, which can be easily modified and adapted to custom experiments by researchers with little to no design experience. Importantly, the authors demonstrate the successful use of this implant across multiple use cases, in head-fixed and freely moving experiments, in mice and rats, with different versions of Neuropixels probes, and across 8 different labs. Taken together, the presented implants promise to make chronic Neuropixel recordings and long-term studies of neuronal activity significantly easier and attainable for both current and future Neuropixels users.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The implants have been successfully tested across 8 different laboratories, in mice and rats, in headfixed and freely moving conditions, and have been adapted in multiple ways for a number of distinct experiments.</p>
<p>Implants are easily customizable and the authors provide a straightforward approach for customization across multiple design dimensions even for researchers not experienced in design.</p>
<p>The authors provide clear and straightforward descriptions of the construction, implantation, and explant of the described implants.</p>
<p>The split of the implant into a docking and payload module makes reuse even in different experiments (using different docking modules) easy.</p>
<p>The authors demonstrate that implants can be re-used multiple times and still allow for high-quality recordings.</p>
<p>The authors show that the chronic implantations allow for the tracking of individual neurons across days and weeks (using additional software tracking solutions), which is critical for a large number of experiments requiring the description of neuronal activity, e.g. throughout learning processes.</p>
<p>The authors show that implanted animals can even perform complex behavioral tasks, with no apparent reduction in their performance.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>While implanted animals can still perform complex behavioral tasks, the authors describe that the implants may reduce the animals' mobility, as measured by prolonged reaction times. However, the presented data does not allow us to judge whether this effect is specifically due to the presented implant or whether any implant or just tethering of the animals per se would have the same effects.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The reviewer is correct: some of the differences in mouse reaction time could be due to the tether rather than the implant. As these experiments were also performed in water-restricted female mice with the heavier Neuropixels 1.0 implant, our data represent the maximal impact of the implant, and we have highlighted this point in the revision (Freely behaving animals, Para 2).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>While the authors make certain comparisons to other, previously published approaches for chronic implantation and re-use of Neuropixels probes, it is hard to make conclusive comparisons and judge the advantages of the current implant. For example, while the authors emphasize that the lower weight of their implant allows them to perform recordings in mice (and is surely advantageous), the previously described, heavier implants they mention (Steinmetz et al., 2021; van Daal et al., 2021), have also been used in mice. Whether the weight difference makes a difference in practice therefore remains somewhat unclear.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The reviewer is correct: without a direct comparison, we cannot be certain that our smaller, lighter implant improves behavioural results (although this is supported by the literature, e.g. Newman <italic>et al</italic>, 2023). However, the reduced weight of our implant is critical for several laboratories represented in this manuscript due to animal welfare requirements. Indeed, in van Daal <italic>et al</italic> the authors “recommend a [mouse] weight of &gt;25 g for implanting Neuropixels 1.0 probes.” This limit precludes using (the vast majority of) female mice, or water-restricted animals. Conversely, our implant can be routinely used with lighter, water-restricted male and female mice. We emphasised this point in the revision (Discussion, Para 2).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The non-permanent integration of the headstages into the implant, while allowing for the use of the same headstage for multiple animals in parallel, requires repeated connections and does not provide strong protection for the implant. This may especially be an issue for the use in rats, requiring additional protective components as in the presented rat experiments.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We apologise for not clarifying the various headstage holder options in the manuscript and we have now addressed this in the revision (Freely behaving animals, Para 1&amp;2). Our repository has headstage holder designs (in the XtraModifications/Mouse_FreelyMoving folder). This allows leaving the headstage on the implant, and thus minimize the number of connections (albeit increasing the weight for the mouse). Indeed, mice recorded while performing the task described in our manuscript had the head-stage semi-permanently integrated to the implant, and we now highlight this in the revision (Freely behaving animals, Para 1).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer 2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>The description of the different versions of the head-stage holders should be more clear, listing also advantages/disadvantages of the different solutions. It would be also useful if the authors could comment on the use of these head-stage holders in rats, since they do not seem to offer much protection.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for this point, and we have added notes to the manuscript to clarify the various advantages of the different headstage-holders, and that the headstage can be permanently attached to the implant (Freely behaving animals, Para 1&amp;2). This is the primary advantage of these solutions compared with the minimal implant—at the expense of increasing the implant weight.</p>
<p>The reviewer’s concerns regarding the lack of protection for implants in rats is well-placed, and we now emphasise that these experiments benefited from the additional protection of an external 3D casing, which is likely critical for use in larger animals (Freely behaving animals, Para 1).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>While re-used probes seem to show similar yields across multiple uses (Figure 4C), it seems as if there is a much higher variability of the yield for probes that are used for the first (maybe also second) time. There are probes with much higher than average yields, but it seems none of the re-used probes show such high yields. Is this a real effect? Is this because the high-yield probes happened to have not been used multiple times? Is there an analysis the authors could provide to reduce the concern that yields may generally be lower for re-used probes/that there are no very high yields for re-used probes?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We understand the reviewer’s concern with respect to Figure 4C, however, the re-use of any given probe was determined only by the experimental needs of the project. It is therefore not possible that there is a relationship between probes selected for re-use and unit-yield. We now specify this in the revised legend of Figure 4C. This variability (and the consistency in yield across uses) likely stems from differences between labs, brain region, and implantation protocol.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The authors claim that a 'large fraction' of units could be tracked for the entire duration of the experiment (Figure 5A,B). They mention in the discussion that quantification can be found in a different manuscript (van Beest et al., 2023), but this should also be quantified here in at least some more detail, also for other animals in addition to the one mouse which was recorded for ~100 days. What fraction can be held for different durations? What is the average holding time, etc.?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the reviewer, and have now added new panels quantifying the probability and reliability of tracking a neuron across days (Figure 5E-F). We also comment on the change in tracking probability across time, and its variability across recordings (Stability, Para 4).</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this manuscript, Bimbard and colleagues describe a new implant apparatus called &quot;Apollo Implant&quot;, which should facilitate recording in freely moving rodents (mice and rats) using Neuropixels probes. The authors collected data from both mice and rats, they used 3 different versions of Neuropixels, multiple labs have already adopted this method, which is impressive. They openly share their CAD designs and surgery protocol to further facilitate the adaptation of their method.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Overall, the &quot;Apollo Implant&quot; is easy to use and adapt, as it has been used in other laboratories successfully and custom modifications are already available. The device is reproducible using common 3D printing services and can be easily modified thanks to its CAD design (the video explaining this is extremely helpful). The weight and price are amazing compared to other systems for rigid silicon probes allowing a wide range of use of the &quot;Apollo Implant&quot;.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The &quot;Apollo Implant&quot; can only handle Neuropixels probes. It cannot hold other widely used and commercially available silicon probes. Certain angles and distances are not possible in their current form (distance between probes 1.8 to 4mm, implantation depth 2-6.5 mm, or angle of insertion up to 20 degrees).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As we now discuss in the manuscript (Discussion, Para 4), one implant accommodating the diversity of the existing probes is beyond the scope of this project. However, because the design is adaptable, groups should be able to modify the current version of the implant to adapt to their electrodes’ size and format (and can highlight any issues in the Github “Discussions” area).</p>
<p>With Neuropixels, the current range of depths covers practically all trajectories in the mouse brain. In rats, where deeper penetrations may be useful, the experimenter can attach the probe at a lower point in the payload module to expose more of the shank. We now specify this in the Github repository.</p>
<p>We have now extended the range of inter-probe distances from a maximum of 4 mm to 6.5 mm. Distances beyond this may be better served by 2 implants, and smaller distances could be achieved by attaching two probes on the same side of the docking module. These points are now specified in the revised manuscript (Flexible design, Para 2).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer 3 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>I have only a few questions and suggestions:</p>
<p>Is it possible to create step-by-step instructions for explantation (similar to Figure-1 with CAD schematics)? You mention that payload holder is attached to a micromanipulator, but it is unclear how this is achieved. How was the payload secured with a screw (which screw)? My understanding is that as you turn the screw in the payload holder, it will grab onto the payload module from both sides, but the screw is not in contact with the payload module, correct? I found the screw type on your GitHub, but it would be great if you could add a bill of materials in a table format, so readers don't have to jump between GitHub and article.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have now added a bill of materials to the revised manuscript (Implant design and materials, Para 2), although up-to-date links are still provided on the Github repository due to changing availability.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>What happens if you do a dual probe implant and cannot avoid blood vessels in one or both of the craniotomies due to the pre-defined geometry? Is this a frequent issue? How can you overcome this during the surgery?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Blood vessels can be difficult to avoid in some cases, but we are typically able to rotate/reposition the probes to solve this issue. In some cases, with 4-shank probes, the blood vessel can be positioned between individual probe shanks. We now detail this in the revised manuscript (Assembly and implantation, Para 3).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>I assume if the head is not aligned (line-332) the probe can break during recovery. Have you experienced this during explanation?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As we now specify in the manuscript (Explantation, Para 2), we are careful when explanting the probe to avoid this issue, and due to the flexibility of the shanks, it does not appear to be a major concern.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Why did you remove the UV glue (line 435)? How can you level the skull? I assume you have covered bregma and lambda in the first surgery which can create an uneven surface to measure even after you remove the UV glue.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for highlighting this omission from the methods. We now explain (Implantation, Carandini-Harris laboratory) that the UV-glue is completely removed during the second surgery, and the skull is cleaned and scored. This improves the adhesion of the dental cement, and allows for reliable levelling of the skull.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>In line 112 you mentioned that the number of recorded neurons was stable; however, you found a 3% mean decrease in unit count per day (line 120). Stability is great until day 10 (in Figure 4A), but it deteriorates quickly after that. I think it would help readers if you could add the mean{plus minus}SEM of recorded units in the text for days 1-10, days 11-50, and days 51-100 (using the data from Figure 4A).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have now added Supplementary Figure 4 to show unit count across bins of days, and a corresponding comment in the text (Stability, Para 2).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>A full survey of the probe (Figure 4B) means that you recorded neuronal activity across 4-5000 channels (depending on how many channels were in the brain). While it is clear that a full probe survey can reduce the number of animals needed for a study, it is also clear in this figure that by day 25 you can record ~300 neurons on 4000 channels. It would be great to discuss this in the discussion and give a balanced view of the long-term stability of these recordings.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Overall, keeping a large number of units for a long time still remains a challenge. Here, we could record on average 85 neurons per bank during the first 10 days, and then only 45 after 50 days. It is important to note that our quantification averages across all banks recorded, including those in a ventricle or partly outside of the brain. Thus, our results represent a lower estimate of the total neurons recorded. Our new Supplementary Figure 4 helps to highlight the diversity of neuron number recorded per animal. Further improvements in surgical techniques and spike sorting will likely improve stability further and we have now added this comment in the manuscript (Stability, Para 2). For example, we observed excellent stability in a mouse where the craniotomy was stabilized with KwikSil (Supplementary Figure 5).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The RMS value was around 20 uV in some of the recordings, and according to Figure 4G it is around 16 uV on average. Is it safe to accept putative single units with 20 uV amplitudes, when the baseline noise level is this close to the spike peak-to-peak amplitude?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>On average, less than 1% of the units selected using all the other metrics except the amplitude had an amplitude below 30 µV, and 2.6% below 50 µV. Increasing the threshold to 30 µV, or even 50 µV, did not affect the results. We have now added this comment in the Methods (Data processing, Para 3).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Can you add the waveform and ISIH of the example unit from day 106 to Figure 5?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have now added 4 units tracked up to day 106 in Figure 5.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Could you move Supplementary Figure 3A to Figure 4? The number of units is more valuable information than the RMS noise level. I understand that you don't have such a nice coverage of all the days as in Figure 3 and 4, but you might be able to group for the first 3 days and the last 3 days (and if data is available, the middle 3 days) as a boxplot. The goal would be for the reader to be able to see whether there is any change in the number of single units over time.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the reviewer, the number of units is more valuable. We had included this information in Figure 4A-F, but we have made edits to the text to make it clearer that this is what is being shown. The data from Figure 3A is already contained within Figure 4, but in 3A the data is separated by individual labs.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Product numbers are missing in multiple places: line-285 (screw), line-288 (screw), line-290 (screw), line-309 (manipulator), line-374 (gold pin and silver wire), line-384 (Mill-Max), line-394 (silver wire), and many more. It would be great if you could add all these details, so people can replicate your protocol.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for highlighting this, and we have added details of screw thread-size and length to relevant parts of the manuscript, although any type of screw can be used. Similarly, other components are non-specific (e.g. multiple silver-wire diameters were used across labs), so we have not included specific product numbers for general consumer items (like screws and silver wires) to avoid indicating that a specific part must be purchased.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>While it is great to see lab-specific methods, I am not sure in their current form it helps to understand the protocol better. The information is conveyed in different ways (I assume these were written by different people), in different orders, and in different depths (some mention probe implant location relative to bregma and midline, some don't). There are many different glues, epoxies, cement, wires, and pins. I would recommend rewriting these methods sections under a unified template, so it is easier to follow.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion and we have rewritten this section of the methods accordingly. We now use a template structure to simplify the comparisons between labs: the same template is used for each lab in each section (payload module assembly, implantation, and data acquisition).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Line-307: why is a skull screw optional for grounding? What did you use for ground and reference if not a ground screw?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We now specify in the manuscript that during head-fixed experiments, the animal’s headplate can be used for grounding, and combined with internal referencing provided by the Neuropixels, yielded lownoise recordings (Implantation protocol, Methods).</p>
