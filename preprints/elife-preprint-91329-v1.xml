<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Systemic blood coagulation accompanies inflammation during severe infection like sepsis and COVID. We’ve previously established a link between pyroptosis, a vital defense mechanism against infection, and coagulopathy. During pyroptosis, the formation of gasdermin-D (GSDMD) pores on the plasma membrane leads to the release of tissue factor (TF)-positive microvesicles (MVs) that are procoagulant. Mice lacking GSDMD release fewer TF MVs. However, the specific mechanisms leading from activation of GSDMD to MV release remain unclear. Plasma membrane rupture (PMR) in pyroptosis was recently reported to be actively mediated by the transmembrane protein Ninjurin-1 (NINJ1). Here we show that NINJ1 promotes procoagulant MV release during pyroptosis. Haploinsuffciency or glycine inhibition of NINJ1 limited the release of procoagulant MVs and inflammatory cytokines and protected against blood coagulation and lethality triggered by bacterial flagellin. Our findings suggest a crucial role for NINJ1-dependent PMR in inflammasome-induced blood coagulation and inflammation.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Inflammasomes are complex intracellular sensors that detect pathogens by sensing pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></italic>). The activation of inflammasome and subsequent pyroptosis is critical in host defense against pathogens (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></italic>). Pyroptosis exposes intracellular pathogens through plasma membrane rupture (PMR) (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></italic>). However, overactive inflammasomes, common in conditions like sepsis and COVID (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></italic>), can trigger systemic blood coagulation and tissue and organ dysfunction (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></italic>).</p>
<p>Tissue factor (TF) is a membrane protein and the primary initiator of the coagulation cascade, essential for hemostasis to stop bleeding upon injury (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></italic>). Increased TF activity is associated with consumption coagulopathy linked to sepsis and COVID (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></italic>). Our previous study has shown that TF-positive MVs released by pyroptotic macrophages trigger systemic coagulation and lethality in experimental sepsis (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></italic>). However, the molecular mechanisms by which pyroptosis releases procoagulant MVs remain elusive. Pyroptotic cells undergo PMR at the late stage when the cell membrane is beyond repair, where the direct blebbing and pinching of the plasma membrane releases MVs to remove membrane damaged with GSDMD pores (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></italic>). PMR could accelerate MV release as the entire plasma membrane is subject to dissolve as MVs. Kayagaki et al. recently reported that Ninjurin-1 (NINJ1) oligomerization activates PMR, a process formerly thought to be passive, during lytic cell death like necrosis and pyroptosis (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></italic>). The role of NINJ1 in releasing procoagulant MVs and initiating systemic coagulation after inflammasome activation remains unknown.</p>
<p>In this study, we show that <italic>Ninj1</italic> haploinsufficiency inhibits the release of TF-positive MVs and provides protection against systemic coagulation. Reduced NINJ1 also limits the release of inflammatory cytokines. We find that a single dose of glycine injection has similar protective effects as they prevent PMR. Our findings underscore the essential role of NINJ1-dependent PMR in inflammasome-induced blood coagulation, thus expanding our understanding of the dual role that inflammasomes play in host defense.</p>

<sec id="s2a">
<title><italic>Ninj1</italic> haploinsufficiency protects against flagellin-induced blood coagulation</title>
<p>We aimed to understand the role of NINJ1 on inflammasome-induced blood coagulation, using heterozygous <italic>Ninj1</italic><sup><italic>+/-</italic></sup> mice with decreased NINJ1 protein adundance (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Fig S1</xref>). This approach was justified by our observation that total NINJ1 deficiency could lead to partial embryonic lethality and the reported occurrence of hydrocephalus in surviving mice (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></italic>).</p>
<p>To induce blood coagulation and lethality, we applied our established protocol the involves injection of mice with purified bacterial flagellin, fused with the cytosolic translocation domain of anthrax lethal factor (LFn). In the presence of anthrax protein protective agent (PA), this flagellin fusion protein (LFn-Fla) can be transported into the cytoplasm (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></italic>). Flagellin is a PAMP known to activate the NAIP/NLRC4 inflammasome and trigger pyroptosis (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></italic>). We confirmed robust inflammasome activation and pyroptosis in mouse primary bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) upon stimulating with purified Fla (LFn-Fla plus PA) (<xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Fig S2A-B</xref>).</p>
<p>Our earlier work has shown that inflammasome-induced systemic coagulation is marked by prolonged prothrombin time (PT) and increased plasma thrombin-antithrombin (TAT) (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></italic>), frequently observed in patients with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) and COVID (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></italic>). As expected, intravenous injection of Fla activated systemic coagulation in wild-type <italic>Ninj1</italic><sup><italic>+/+</italic></sup> mice, demonstrated by a significant increase of PT and a rise in plasma TAT (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A-B</xref>). Notably, when challenged with Fla, heterozygous <italic>Ninj1</italic><sup><italic>+/-</italic></sup> mice showed lower PT and almost complete suppression of the elevation in plasma TAT compared with their wild-type littermates (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A-B</xref>). Our results suggest that a single copy deletion of <italic>Ninj1</italic> is adequate for significant inhibition of inflammasome-induced blood coagulation.</p>

<p>We also found that <italic>Ninj1</italic> haploinsufficiency hindered the release of cytokines, as shown by decreased plasma concentrations of cytokines like IL-1β, TNFα, and IL-6 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1C-E</xref>). The decrease in cytokine concentrations could be attributed to limited release of danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) due to less effective PMR in <italic>Ninj1</italic><sup><italic>+/-</italic></sup> mice. While our earlier research suggested that cell death, not the release of inflammatory cytokines like IL-1β, is crucial for the over-activation of blood coagulation triggered by inflammasomes (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></italic>), these cytokines are vital for maintaining inflammation. Our findings indicate their release is facilitated by NINJ1.</p>

<title>Fibrin deposition and lethality resulting from inflammasome activation depend on NINJ1</title>
<p>Fibrin deposition in tissues can restrict blood supply, potentially resulting in tissue and organ damage and even death (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></italic>). Following the Fla challenge, we noted fibrin deposition in the lungs of wild-type mice through immunostaining with a fibrin-specific antibody (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1F</xref>). However, no signs of fibrin deposition were observed in lung sections of <italic>Ninj1</italic><sup><italic>+/-</italic></sup> mice, likely due to the technical limitations of immunostaining on thin (5-μm) tissue sections, compounded by the potential for uneven fibrin distribution. By using immunoblot to examine a homogenized whole lobe of the lung or liver, we detected fibrin deposition in the liver and lungs of <italic>Ninj1</italic><sup><italic>+/-</italic></sup> mice, but to a much less extent compared with their <italic>Ninj1</italic><sup><italic>+/+</italic></sup> littermates (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1G</xref>). Furthermore, <italic>Ninj1</italic> haploinsufficiency partially rescued flagellin-induced lethality (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1H</xref>). These findings underscore the significant role of NINJ1 protein in inflammasome-triggered fibrin deposition in tissues and lethality.</p>

<title>NINJ1 plays a critical role in systemic coagulation in response to <italic>E. coli</italic> infection</title>
<p>Systemic blood coagulation is a common complication of pathogen-triggered sepsis (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></italic>). To investigate the role of NINJ1 in bacterial infection-induced blood coagulation, <italic>Ninj1</italic><sup><italic>+/-</italic></sup> mice were infected with cultured <italic>E. coli</italic> at a dose of 2 x 10<sup>8</sup> pfu per mouse. Consistently with the findings from the Fla challenge, <italic>E. coli</italic> infection-induced blood coagulation was limited by <italic>Ninj1</italic> haploinsufficiency. As shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A-B</xref>, <italic>Ninj1</italic><sup><italic>+/-</italic></sup> mice exhibited a lower PT and decreased plasma TAT following <italic>E. coli</italic> infection. Furthermore, <italic>Ninj1</italic><sup><italic>+/-</italic></sup> mice displayed alleviated cytokine release in response to <italic>E. coli</italic> infection (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2C-E</xref>). Collectively, these data demonstrate that reduced expression of NINJ1 confers protection against <italic>E. coli</italic> infection-induced blood coagulation. In addition, the alleviation of cytokine release in <italic>Ninj1</italic><sup><italic>+/-</italic></sup> mice supports the role of NINJ1 in modulating the inflammatory response to <italic>E. coli</italic> infection. These findings highlight a potential role of NINJ1 in the pathogenesis of bacterial infection, including blood coagulation and the cytokine storm.</p>

<title>NINJ1-dependent PMR promotes procoagulant MV and proinflammatory cytokine release</title>
<p>In our previous work, we established that macrophage pyroptosis promotes the release of procoagulant MVs (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></italic>). Yet, the cellular processes linking pyroptosis to MV release remain to be defined. We hypothesize that PMR during pyroptosis could be the molecular event responsible for the release of these MVs. To test this hypothesis, we used BMDMs isolated from <italic>Ninj1</italic><sup><italic>+/+</italic></sup> and <italic>Ninj1</italic><sup><italic>+/-</italic></sup> littermates. We observed a significant reduction in PMR, indicated by the decreased lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) in culture medium, in <italic>Ninj1</italic><sup><italic>+/-</italic></sup> cells (<xref rid="figS3" ref-type="fig">Fig S3A</xref>), while cell death, measured by ATP levels, remained unaffected (<xref rid="figS3" ref-type="fig">Fig S3B</xref>). This is consistent with previous studies suggesting that NINJ1 mediates PMR but not cell death (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></italic>).</p>
<p>Notably, we detected NINJ1 protein in MVs released from <italic>Ninj1</italic><sup><italic>+/+</italic></sup> BMDMs (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3A</xref>). The protein level was decreased in MVs derived from <italic>Ninj1</italic><sup><italic>+/-</italic></sup> BMDMs (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3A</xref>), likely due to reduced MV release and reduced NINJ1 protein in <italic>Ninj1</italic><sup><italic>+/-</italic></sup> cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3B</xref>). Consistently, <italic>in vivo</italic>, NINJ1 was detected in plasma MVs from <italic>Ninj1</italic><sup><italic>+/+</italic></sup> mice exposed to Fla (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3C</xref>). <italic>Ninj1</italic><sup><italic>+/-</italic></sup> mice also had decreased amount of NINJ1 from MVs, likely due to fewer plasma MVs (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3D</xref>). The reduced quantity of MVs from both plasma and BMDMs in <italic>Ninj1</italic><sup><italic>+/-</italic></sup> mice correlated with lower TF activity (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3E</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3F</xref>). Our data illustrate that a decline in NINJ1 expression significantly reduces PMR and MV release. These findings provide compelling evidence supporting a critical role of NINJ1-dependent PMR in procoagulant MV release. Furthermore, MV shedding removes NINJ1 from the plasma membrane, hinting at a possible role of NINJ1 in cell repair.</p>

<title>Glycine inhibition of NINJ1 alleviates pyroptosis-induced blood coagulation</title>
<p>It has long been recognized that glycine buffering protects against PMR during cell death, such as pyroptosis and necrosis (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></italic>). The exact mechanisms underlying the glycine protective effects remained unclear until Borges et al. revealed that glycine inhibits NINJ1 oligomerization and shields cells from rupture (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></italic>). Yet, whether glycine buffering would block the release of PMR-induced TF MVs or limit pyroptosis-induced coagulation <italic>in vivo</italic> is unknown. To complement our genetic approach, we injected a glycine solution into wild-type mice, prior to Fla injection, aiming to inhibit NINJ1.</p>
<p>Intriguingly, following the Fla challenge, glycine injection led to a notable decrease in PT and plasma TAT (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4A</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4B</xref>), demonstrating significant protection against flagellin-induced blood coagulation. Consistently, mice treated with glycine exhibited lower plasma MV TF activity post the Fla challenge (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4C</xref>). <italic>In vitro</italic>, glycine buffering on isolated BMDMs protected against PMR, as denoted by a reduction LDH release (<xref rid="figS4" ref-type="fig">Fig S4A</xref>), and decreased MV TF activity (<xref rid="figS4" ref-type="fig">Fig S4B</xref>). However, we observed a discrepancy in MV counts between the <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> studies. Contrary to isolated BMDMs (<xref rid="figS4" ref-type="fig">Fig S4C</xref>), glycine-treated mice had higher MV counts irrespective of the Fla challenge (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4D</xref>). We speculate that glycine might enhance MV release from cell types other than macrophages, independently of inflammasome activation. Lastly, glycine administration reduced the release of proinflammatory cytokines IL-1b and TNFa (consistent with previous research (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></italic>)), but not IL-6 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4E-G</xref>). In conclusion, the cytoprotective effect of glycine buffering resulted in improved outcomes in inflammasome-induced blood coagulation and inflammation.</p>

<caption><title>Glycine inhibition of NINJ1 blocks pyroptosis-induced blood coagulation.</title>
<p>Mice were injected intravenously 50 μl of 0.5 M glycine 2 hours before administrating Ctrl (saline) or Fla (500 ng LFn-Fla plus 3 μg PA). Blood was collected 90 minutes afterwards. Prothrombin time (<bold>A</bold>), plasma TAT (<bold>B</bold>), plasma TF MV activity (<bold>C</bold>), plasma MV counts (D), and plasma cytokines (<bold>E-G</bold>) were measured. Circles represent individual mouse, with bars donating mean. * p &lt; 0.05, ** p &lt; 0.01, n.s. donates not significant (two-way ANOVA with Holm-Sidak multiple comparisons).</p></caption>

<p>In summary, our study employed both genetic and pharmacological approaches to inhibit NINJ1-dependent PMR. Our findings suggest that PMR serves as a pivotal molecular event responsible for the release of procoagulant MVs and the induction of systemic coagulation and inflammation in an experimental model of sepsis. This novel mechanism sheds light on the potential for developing NINJ1 inhibition as a promising therapeutic strategy for alleviating acute inflammation and coagulation-associated organs and tissue and organ damage.</p>

<title>Recombinant protein purification</title>
<p>Recombinant proteins were expressed using LPS free <italic>E. coli</italic> strain ClearColi BL21(DE3) (Lucigen Corporation, Cat#60810) at 37 °C for 4 hours with 500 μM IPTG after OD600 reached 0.6-0.8. Bacteria were collected and lysed in 50 mM Tris-HCL and 300 mM NaCl. Proteins containing a His-tag were purified by affinity chromatography using HisPur Ni-NTA resin (Thermo scientific, Cat#88222). Proteins were then eluted with 250 mM imidazole in 50 mM Tris-HCl and 300 mM NaCl, and subsequently dialyzed against PBS to remove imidazole. Proteins concentrations were determined by measuring A280 before sterile filtration.</p>

<p>Referring to previous research findings, the authors explain the connection between NINJ1 and MVs. Additional experiments and clarifications will strengthen the conclusions of this study.</p>
<p>Below are some comments I feel could strengthen the manuscript:</p>
<p>1. The authors mentioned their choice of using heterozygous NINJ1+/- mice on page 4, because of lethality and hydrocephalus. Nonetheless, there is a substantial number of references that use homozygous NINJ1-/- mice. Could there be any other specific reasons for using heterozygous mice in this study?</p>
<p>2. Figure S2 clearly shows the method of pyroptosis induction by flagellin. It is also necessary as a prerequisite for this paper to show the changes in flagellin-induced pyroptosis in heterozygous NINJ1+/- mice.</p>
<p>3. IL-1ß levels controlled by GSDMD were not affected by NINJ1 expression according to previous studies (Ref 37, 29, Nature volume 618, pages 1065-1071 (2023)). GSDMD also plays an important role in TF release in pyroptosis. Are GSDMD levels not altered in heterozygous NINJ1 +/- mice?</p>
<p>4. In Fig 1 F, the authors used a fibrin-specific monoclonal antibody for staining fibrin, but it's not clearly defined. There may be some problem with the quality of antibody or technical issues. Considering this, exploring alternative methods to visualize fibrin might be beneficial. Fibrin is an acidophil material, so attempting H&amp;E staining or Movat's pentachrome staining might help for identify fibrin areas.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
The author's main goal is to understand the mechanism by which pyroptosis (through the formation of Gasdermin D (GSDMD) pores in the plasma membrane) contributes to increased release of procoagulant Tissue Factor-containing microvesicles (MV). Their previous data demonstrate that GSDMD is critical for the release of MV that contains Tissue Factor (TF), thus making a link between pyroptosis and hypercoagulation. Given the recent identification of NINJ1 being responsible for plasma membrane rupture (Kayagaki et al. Nature 2011), the authors wanted to determine if NINJ1 is responsible for TF-containing MV release. Given the constitutive ninj1 KO mouse leads to partial embryonic lethality, the authors decided to use a heterozygous ninj1 KO mouse (ninj1+/-). While the data are well controlled, there is limited understanding of the mechanism of action. Also, given that the GSDMD pores have an ~18 nm inner diameter enough to release IL-1β, while larger molecules like LDH (140 kDa) and other DAMPs require plasma membrane rupture (likely mediated by NINJ1), it s not unexpected that large MVs require NINJ1-mediated plasma cell rupture.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
The authors convincingly demonstrate that ninj1 haploinsufficiency leads to decreased prothrombin time, plasma TAT and plasma cytokines 90 minutes post-treatment in mice, which leads to partial protection from lethality.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
- In the abstract, the authors say &quot;...cytokines and protected against blood coagulation and lethality triggered by bacterial flagellin&quot;. This conclusion is not substantiated by the data, as you still see 70% mortality at 24 hours in the ninj1+/- mice.</p>
<p>- The previous publication by the authors (Wu et al. Immunity 2019) clearly shows that GSDMD-dependent pyroptosis is required for inflammasome-induced coagulation and mouse lethality. However, as it is not possible for the authors to use the homozygous ninj1 KO mouse due to partial embryonic lethality, it becomes challenging to compare these two studies and the contributions of GSDMD vs. NINJ1. Comparing the contributions of GSDMD and NINJ1 in human blood-derived monocytes/macrophages where you can delete both genes and assess their relevant contributions to TF-containing MV release within the same background would be crucial in comparing how much contribution NINJ1 has versus what has been published for GSDMD? This would help support the in vivo findings and further corroborate the proposed conclusions made in this manuscript.</p>
<p>- What are the levels of plasma TAT, PT, and inflammatory cytokines if you collect plasma after 90 minutes? Given the majority (~70%) of the ninj+/- mice are dead by 24 hours, it is imperative to determine whether the 90-minute timeframe data (in Fig 1A-G) is also representative of later time points. The question is whether ninj1+/- just delays the increases in prothrombin time, plasma TAT, and plasma cytokines.</p>
