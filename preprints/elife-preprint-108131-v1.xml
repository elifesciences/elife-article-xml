<abstract>
<title>Abstract</title><p>Prolyl-hydroxylases (PHDs) are oxygen sensing enzymes that mediate the hydroxylation of proline residues. In mammals, three PHD isoforms (PHD1-3) are responsible for proline hydroxylation of Hypoxia Inducible Factor (HIF) alpha, a key regulator of the hypoxia response. In the accompanying paper (Jiang et. al., 2025) we report development of a mass spectrometry-based method to reliably identify proline hydroxylation (OH-Pro) sites on proteins and use this to identify a PHD-dependent OH-Pro modification at Pro604 on the protein RepoMan (CDCA2), a regulatory subunit for protein phosphatase PP1γ, with important roles in mitotic progression and cell viability.</p>
<p>Here, we investigate the functional significance of hydroxylation of RepoMan at P604. During M phase, the PP1-RepoMan complex dephosphorylates Thr3 of Histone H3 (H3T3) on chromosomes arms to ensure the correct localisation of the chromosomal passenger complex (CPC) at centromeres. We show that siRNA depletion of PHD1, but not PHD2, increases H3T3 phosphorylation in prometaphase-arrested cells. In cells depleted of endogenous RepoMan, exogenous expression of wild type RepoMan, but not a RepoMan P604A mutant, restored normal H3T3 phosphorylation localisation in prometaphase arrested cells. RepoMan P604 is located proximal to the Short Linear Motifs (SLiMs) that function as binding sites for the serine/threonine Protein Phosphatase 2A (PP2A). The interaction of RepoMan and PP2A-B56γ is reduced in cells expressing RepoMan P604A. Moreover, analyses in both fixed and live cells released from a prometaphase arrest, show that expression of the RepoMan P604A mutant delays completion of mitosis, results in defects in chromosome alignment and segregation and increases levels of cell death. These data support a role for PHD1-mediated prolyl hydroxylation in controlling progression through mitosis, acting, at least in part, via hydroxylation of RepoMan at P604 regulating the interaction of RepoMan with PP2A during chromosome alignment and thereby controlling the levels of Histone H3 phosphorylation at Thr3.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Proline hydroxylases (PHDs) are part of a large family of 2-oxoglutarate, iron and oxygen dependent enzymes (2-OGD) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. PHDs are best known for their role in hydroxylating and controlling Hypoxia Inducible Factor (HIF) levels in normal oxygen, iron and 2-oxoglutarate conditions <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. They are also sensitive to metabolites analogous to 2-oxoglutarate. including succinate and fumarate <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>, oncometabolites, such as L2-hydroxyglutarate <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup> and certain amino acids <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. PHDs are thus intricately linked to oxygen and metabolic sensing and control <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>There are three PHD enzymes in mammals, termed PHD1, PHD2 and PHD3, all of which have HIF hydroxylating functions <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>. However, PHD2 is the dominant PHD for HIF hydroxylation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>, with PHD1 and PHD3 being required for negative feedback loops <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>. PHD1 is not hypoxia inducible. Hydroxylation of HIFα results in the formation of a high affinity binding site for the von Hippel Lindau (VHL) protein, which is the recognition component of an E3-ubiquitin ligase, targeting HIFα for rapid degradation by the proteosome <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. Given the importance of PHDs in controlling HIF levels, several PHD inhibitors have been developed by the pharmaceutical industry <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>, and these are now approved for use in human patients suffering from anaemia derived from chronic kidney disease <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Identification of additional PHD targets, outside the HIF family, has been surrounded by controversy over the last 15 years, confounded by the fact that only PHD2 has a significant phenotype in knockout mice <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. However, recent studies have provided evidence, based upon a combination of genetic, biochemical, molecular and cellular biological data, identifying additional targets for all PHD enzymes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. When analysing the function of these novel targets, broadly, PHD2 targets seem to relate to signalling and metabolism, while PHD1 targets align to gene regulation and cell cycle <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>We have developed a robust, mass spectrometry-based method for the enrichment and identification of proline hydroxylation sites on target proteins, allowing the detection of PHD targets in cell and tissue extracts. In the accompanying manuscript <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>, we validate this MS approach and use it to identify a set of putative PHD target proteins. We have previously shown that PHD1 contributes to the control of cell cycle progression <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. Interestingly, one of the novel PHD1 target proteins identified by Jiang et al. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>, was CDCA2, also known as RepoMan, which is a cell cycle regulated protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) interacting protein<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup> RepoMan functions as a regulatory subunit for protein phosphatase PP1γ, with important roles in mitotic progression, chromosome architecture and cell viability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>. RepoMan localisation to chromatin is regulated during the cell cycle by phosphorylation and dephosphorylation mechanisms and this is required for proper chromosomal passenger complex (CPC) localization and mitosis progression <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Here, we characterise the functional significance of RepoMan hydroxylation at P604, as identified by Jiang et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. We demonstrate that RepoMan hydroxylation at P604 is sensitive to PHD inhibitors, PHD1 depletion and increased levels of fumarate. RepoMan P604 hydroxylation is required for efficient mitotic progression from prometaphase into metaphase with loss of P604 hydroxylation causing delayed mitosis, defects in chromosomes alignment and segregation and cell death. These results support a critical role for PHD1 in controlling cell cycle progression and expand the repertoire of validated protein targets whose function depends upon site-specific proline hydroxylation.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<sec id="s2a">
<title>RepoMan interacts with PHD1 in asynchronous cells</title>
<p>Previous studies have shown that RepoMan localises to chromatin during interphase but rapidly dissociates from chromatin and becomes diffusely distributed when cells enter mitosis. Upon anaphase onset, RepoMan loads back on to chromatin and remains there until the next mitosis <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>. First, therefore, we confirmed by immunofluorescence that we could reproduce the previously reported localization behaviour of endogenous RepoMan throughout the cell cycle, both in fixed HeLa cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>) and in live HeLa cells using YFP-RepoMan (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). These results support the previous conclusions and show that RepoMan loads onto chromatin in HeLa cells at anaphase onset and remains associated with chromatin throughout the subsequent interphase, until is dissociates from chromatin when cells enter the next mitosis.</p>

</fig>
<p>Next, we compared the localisation of RepoMan and PHD1 across the cell cycle in asynchronous cells by analysing the localisation of endogenous RepoMan in HeLa cells transiently expressing EGFP-PHD1, both during interphase and mitosis (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). EGFP-PHD1 localised in nuclei during interphase, consistent with previous results showing PHD1 to be bound to promoter regions and involved in hydroxylation of histone H3 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>. RepoMan also localised to nuclei during interphase but became enriched around the chromosome periphery during prometaphase (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). However, at anaphase onset, RepoMan, as expected, loads on to chromatin, but PHD1 remains diffuse around the segregating anaphase chromosomes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). These results show that the localisation patterns of PHD1 and RepoMan are not identical, consistent with PHD1 acting on multiple different target proteins and not only RepoMan. The main overlap in localisation occurs during interphase and prometaphase, potentially allowing enzyme and substrate to colocalize and interact.</p>

<p>RepoMan does not possess the consensus motif for proline hydroxylation (LXXLAP) present in HIFα. However, a short sequence next to Pro604 in RepoMan (PSIP), is similar to the PYIP sequence next to Pro564 in HIF1α (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). These amino acids are involved in the PHD2-HIF1 oxygen-dependent degradation domain interaction through hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interaction with residues in PHD2 that are conserved in PHD1 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup> and may thus be involved in the RepoMan-PHD interaction we detect in cells. To test this further, we analysed the interaction between RepoMan and ectopically expressed EGFP-PHD1 in asynchronous cultures of HeLa cells. Co-IP experiments, using GFP-Trap, show that endogenous RepoMan is in a complex with EGFP-PHD1 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>). Together, these results are consistent with a model in which RepoMan and PHD1 can potentially interact throughout the cell cycle, except during anaphase, suggesting that the hydroxylation of RepoMan P604 by PHD1 might occur before chromosome segregation.</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<title>Reduction in either PHD1 levels or activity increases H3T3ph on chromosome arms</title>
<p>RepoMan functions as a regulatory subunit for protein phosphatase PP1γ, with important roles in mitotic progression and cell viability (Trinkle-Mulcahy, 2006). During prometaphase and metaphase, PP1-associated RepoMan dephosphorylates Thr3 of Histone H3 (H3T3) on chromosomes arms <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>. This prevents the recruitment of the chromosomal passenger complex (CPC) and promotes the correct localisation of the CPC complex to centromeres, where H3T3 serves as a docking site (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). Proper localisation of the CPC is crucial to ensure correct chromosome alignment and segregation during mitosis <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>. Reduction of RepoMan expression by siRNA has been reported to increase H3T3 phosphorylation on chromosome arms in prometaphase cells <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>. To determine if this result could be replicated in our experiments, RepoMan was knocked down in HeLa cells using siRNA and H3T3 phosphorylation analysed in nocodazole-arrested cells, both by immunofluorescence (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>) and Western blot (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>). This confirmed the previous reports that RepoMan depletion coincides with increased H3T3 phosphorylation. Importantly, this result validates the use of H3T3 phosphorylation as a readout of RepoMan function.</p>

<p>Next, we investigated the potential biological role of RepoMan P604 hydroxylation, analysing H3T3 phosphorylation during prometaphase. First, H3T3 phosphorylation was analysed after treating cells with the PHD inhibitor, FG4592. This revealed that FG4592 treatment resulted in increased levels of phosphorylated H3T3 in mitotic cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>), as does RepoMan depletion (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>). These observations are consistent with RepoMan hydroxylation being necessary for RepoMan-dependent dephosphorylation of H3T3 in cells during early mitosis (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>).</p>
<p>PHD enzymes are known to sense changes in levels of metabolites, as well as oxygen, for example, responding to increased levels of TCA metabolites, such as fumarate <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>. Therefore, we investigated if PHD inhibition by fumarate also impaired the ability of RepoMan to regulate H3T3 phosphorylation. Treatment of HeLa cells with fumarate resulted in increased phosphorylation of H3T3 in mitotic cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>), analogous to that observed after FG4592 treatment. These data suggest that PHD activity is involved in the regulation of H3T3 phosphorylation during prometaphase and further indicate that prometaphase can be modulated in response to changes in levels of metabolites.</p>
<p>While we demonstrate here, and in the accompanying paper by Jiang et al <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>., that PHD1 can hydroxylate RepoMan at P604, we wanted to investigate whether RepoMan may also be a target for PHD2. Therefore, we analysed levels of H3T3 phosphorylation by immunofluorescence, comparing how this was affected by siRNA knock-down of either PHD1, or PHD2. This showed that only depletion of PHD1, but not PHD2, resulted in increased levels of H3T3 phosphorylation in nocodazole-arrested cells, similar to that seen after siRNA-knockdown of RepoMan (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F-G</xref>). Similar results were observed when lysates of nocodazole-arrested cells, which had been depleted of PHD1 by siRNA, were analysed by immunoblotting (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3H</xref>). Due to the lack of antibodies that can detect endogenous PHD1, we confirmed the knockdown of PHD1 in HeLa cells, either by immunofluorescence analysis of cells transiently expressing EGFP-PHD1, or by western blot analysis of a HEK293 cell line stably expressing GFP-PHD1 (Figure S1A-B).</p>
<p>Taken together, these results indicate that PHD1 is involved in RepoMan regulation and can modulate the levels of phosphorylated H3T3. The data are also consistent with the hydroxylation of RepoMan at P604 being important for its function during early mitosis.</p>

<title>P604 hydroxylation is necessary for RepoMan function in early mitosis</title>
<p>To investigate further the functional role of RepoMan Pro604 hydroxylation in early mitosis, we generated stable HeLa cell lines that exogenously express either a YFP-tagged wt RepoMan or a YFP-tagged point mutation of RepoMan, in which the hydroxylated Proline 604 is replaced with Alanine, (YFP-RepoMan-P604A). These cell lines are doxycycline inducible and the YFP-RepoMan expressed is also resistant to siRNAs that deplete endogenous RepoMan, allowing for rescue experiments to be performed. Both the inducible RepoMan wt and P604A mutant expressed at comparable levels, similar to the levels of endogenous RepoMan (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>).</p>

<p>We analysed by immunofluorescence the localization and levels of phosphorylated H3T3 to determine if this is affected during early mitosis by expression of the RepoMan P604A mutant protein. As expected, in control cells transfected with an siRNA control (without doxycycline), phosphorylated H3T3 localises preferentially to centromeres, while cells transfected with siRNA that depletes endogenous RepoMan show phosphorylated H3T3 spread along chromosome arms (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B-C</xref>).</p>
<p>The induction of YFP-RepoMan-wt in cells depleted of endogenous RepoMan by siRNA transfection clearly rescued the phosphorylated H3T3 phenotype observed in control cells, i.e., immunofluorescence again shows H3T3 localised preferentially to centromeres. Interestingly, however, induction with doxycycline of the YFP-RepoMan-P604A mutant, in contrast to the YFP-RepoMan-wt, was unable to rescue knockdown of endogenous RepoMan, with H3T3 phosphorylation still showing a similar distribution spread along chromosome arms as seen in cells depleted of endogenous RepoMan (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4 B-C</xref>). We note that this mislocalisation of phosphorylated H3T3, as seen both after siRNA depletion of endogenous RepoMan and in the presence of the exogenous YFP-RepoMan-P604A mutant, is similar to that observed in cells expressing endogenous RepoMan after siRNA mediated depletion of PHD1 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref>). Together, these results suggest that hydroxylation of RepoMan at P604 is required for the PP1-RepoMan complex to dephosphorylate H3T3 from chromosome arms during prometaphase.</p>

<title>P604-RepoMan is required for PP2-B56 interaction during (pro)metaphase</title>
<p>The loading of PP1-RepoMan onto chromatin during mitosis is dynamic and depends on phosphorylation of Ser893 in the histone binding domain of RepoMan (Qian, 2015). This residue is phosphorylated by Aurora B and dephosphorylated by a pool of PP2A-B56 that is associated to RepoMan (Qian, 2015). As we saw no evidence that lack of hydroxylation on P604 alters levels of RepoMan protein (Figure S2A), we sought to determine whether the YFP-P604A RepoMan mutant mislocalized during the cell cycle, as compared with the equivalent YFP-RepoMan wt protein. To do this, we used live cell imaging in HeLa cells released from a 24h thymidine block, comparing the degree of loading onto chromatin in early mitosis of the respective, exogenously expressed YFP-tagged wt and P604A RepoMan proteins. Both the wt and mutant constructs showed similar levels of loading onto chromatin during (pro)metaphase (Figure S2B).</p>
<p>We next compared the association of the YFP-tagged wt and P604A RepoMan proteins with chromatin as cells traversed mitosis by measuring the ratio of RepoMan to DNA signals in cells entering mitosis. We note that the level of RepoMan expression differs between individual cells analysed in this experiment, due to measurements being made with a mixed population of cells, rather than a clone. To account for this, we normalized the values of fluorescence intensity measured throughout mitosis progression, with the intensity of YFP-tagged RepoMan in G2 (T0), for each cell that was measured (Figure S2C). This analysis revealed that the YFP-RepoMan-P604A mutant loads onto chromatin almost twice faster than wt, suggesting potential changes to the interaction of RepoMan with B56/PP2A during prometaphase.</p>
<p>Phosphorylation of Ser893 on RepoMan, by AuroraB, prevents the loading of RepoMan to chromatin during prometaphase <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>, with this phosphorylation being removed by the phosphatase PP2A/B56! <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>. The PP2A/B56 γ binding site on RepoMan occurs in the short linear motif (SLIM) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup> that is located 13 amino acids away from Pro604 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). We therefore hypothesised that the hydroxylation of Pro604 on RepoMan could affect the interaction with B56! during prometaphase and thus promote the loading of the PP1-RepoMan complex to chromatin, leading to the dephosphorylation of H3T3 on chromosome arms. It has been reported that the interaction between B56γ and RepoMan takes place during mitosis, reaching a maximum at prometaphase <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>.</p>

<p>To test whether the hydroxylation of P604 on RepoMan alters its interaction with PP2A-B56γ during prometaphase, we performed PLA assays, (Proximity Ligation Reaction), in either asynchronous HeLa cell cultures, or in cells synchronised in prometaphase with monastrol (an inhibitor of Eg5), using anti-GFP and anti-B56γ antibodies to detect YFP-RepoMan and endogenous PP2A-B56γ, respectively. As shown by DAPI content, (n=G1 and 2n=G2/Mitosis), the cell cycle synchronization procedure was successful for both YFP-RepoMan-wt and the YFP-RepoMan-P604A mutant (Figure S3).</p>
<p>In prometaphase cells, YFP-RepoMan-wt shows a higher number of PLA foci, as compared with cells expressing the YFP-RepoMan-P604A mutant (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>). This is consistent with the YFP-RepoMan-P604A mutant having a reduced interaction with B56γ. To further validate this finding, co-immunoprecipitation experiments were performed, using GFP-Trap beads and cells synchronised with nocodazole in prometaphase, comparing expression of YFP-RepoMan-wt and the YFP-RepoMan-P604A mutant. While cells expressing the wt and mutant RepoMan constructs synchronised equally well (Figure S3), the YFP-RepoMan-P604A mutant showed a reduced interaction with endogenous B56γ, as compared with the YFP-RepoMan-wt protein (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>).</p>
<p>We validated this important finding further, using an orthogonal approach. For this, cells were generated that expressed either YFP-RepoMan-wt, or the YFP-RepoMan-P604A mutant, (both constructs being doxycycline inducible and resistant to siRNA targeted to endogenous RepoMan), in cells that also constitutively express mCherry-B56γ. Western blot analysis of cell lysates transfected with either siRNA non-targeting control, or siRNA targeted to knock-down endogenous RepoMan, demonstrates that the expression levels of both exogenous YFP-RepoMan-wt and YFP-RepoMan-P604A proteins are comparable and similar to the level of endogenous RepoMan in these cells prior to knock-down (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>).</p>
<p>Next, we compared the interaction between YFP-RepoMan-wt and YFP-RepoMan-P604A, with mCherry-B56γ-wt on the telomere of chromosome 1, using the dead Cas9 (dCas9)-DARPin system <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>. Cells were transiently co-transfected with dCas9-DARPin-Flag and sgChr1 expression vectors, following the depletion of endogenous RepoMan with siRNA. Both dCAS9-DARPin and the YFP-RepoMan constructs are doxycycline inducible. Cells were arrested in prometaphase with nocodazole and fixed for immunofluorescence analysis (see Methods). The GFP panel represents YFP-RepoMan, while the flag panel represents dCas-9-DARPin (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref>). Upon recruitment of mCherry-B56γ, strong foci are seen when YFP-RepoMan-wt is induced (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref>, upper row). However, in cells where YFP-RepoMan-P604A mutant is induced, the intensity of the foci is clearly reduced (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref>, lower row). Quantification of the foci intensity (i.e., the B56γ/YFP ratio), confirms that there is a lower level of interaction between YFP-RepoMan-P604A and mCherry-B56γ, in comparison with YFP-RepoMan-wt (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5F</xref>). Importantly, the YFP levels in foci are similar for expression of both the YFP-RepoMan-wt and YFP-RepoMan-P604A mutant, indicating that the difference observed in interaction with mCherry-B56γ is not due to differences in the level of YFP recruited to DARPin (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5F</xref>).</p>
<p>Overall, these results indicate that Proline 604 in RepoMan is important for the interaction between B56γ and RepoMan during prometaphase and support a model in which the hydroxylation of RepoMan P604 favours interaction with B56γ in cells during prometaphase.</p>

Time lapse analysis was performed in HeLa cells that had been arrested with monastrol in prometaphase (T=0) and then released into fresh media. On average, anaphase onset in cells expressing YFP-Repoman-wt occurred 60-70 mins after release from monastrol. However, in cells expressing the YFP-RepoMan-P604A mutant there was an increase in cells failing to complete mitosis, while most of those cells that completed mitosis after monastrol release did so more slowly, showing on average a delay of 15-30 mins compared with cells expressing YFP-Repoman-wt (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In the accompanying study by Jiang et al. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>, we have identified by mass spectrometry that the PP1 regulatory subunit, RepoMan (CDCA2), is hydroxylated at P604 by PHD1, both in cell lines and <italic>in vitro</italic>. Here, we have used a combination of cellular, biochemical and fluorescence imaging assays to analyse the potential functional significance of site-specific hydroxylation of RepoMan at P604. We have compared the effect of expressing wt RepoMan with expressing a single site mutation that replaces proline 604 with alanine. In addition, we have compared the effect of expressing the RepoMan-P604A mutant in cells, with siRNA knock-down of PHD1 in cells expressing wt RepoMan. Collectively, these experiments showed that replacing wild type RepoMan in cells with a RepoMan-P604A mutant resulted in major defects in early mitosis. These defects included mislocalisation of phosphorylated H3T3, along with decreased interaction with the B56 protein, which is an important targeting subunit for the PP2A-B56 phosphatase complex that dephosphorylates the PP1-RepoMan phosphatase to promote its loading onto chromatin, prior to anaphase onset. Furthermore, in cells expressing the RepoMan-P604A mutant a variety of defects were apparent, including problems with chromosome alignment and segregation and increased cell death, as previously seen in cells expressing endogenous RepoMan after depletion of PHD1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>In combination, the data summarised above lead us to propose the model shown in <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>., In this model, the PP1-RepoMan phosphatase complex associates with chromatin throughout the cell cycle, except during prophase when cells enter mitosis. During prometaphase, PHD1-mediated, site-specific hydroxylation of RepoMan at P604 (OH-P604), contributes to stabilising the interaction between the PP1-RepoMan and PP2A-B56 phosphatase complexes, thereby allowing PP2A-B56 to dephosphorylate RepoMan at S893, which in turn allows re-loading of PP1-RepoMan onto chromatin. We propose that when the PP1-RepoMan complex is bound to chromatin, it dephosphorylates phH3T3 on chromosome arms, which aids in targeting the chromosomal passenger complex (CPC) to preferentially bind to centromeres, where higher levels of phH3T3 remain and act as docking sites for the CPC. The PP1-RepoMan phosphatase complex then remains associated with chromatin throughout the remainder of mitosis and the following interphase. Entry into the next mitotic cycle sees the activation of Aurora B kinase, which phosphorylates RepoMan on Ser893 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup> and prevents its association with chromatin during prometaphase.</p>

</fig>
<p>To the best of our knowledge, the model shown in <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref> is consistent with all experimental observations, both from our current work and from previous studies by ourselves and others, concerning the dynamic localisation of the RepoMan protein during the cell cycle and its role in mechanisms controlling progression through mitosis <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>. Importantly, the data here and in the accompanying manuscript by Jiang et al. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>, use mass spectrometry to identify unambiguously the site-specific hydroxylation of RepoMan at P604 by PHD1 and then characterise the functional significance of this post translational modification for protein interactions involved in mechanisms important for efficient control of mitotic progression. These new data support and extend our previous observations that PHD enzymes contribute to the regulation of cell cycle progression <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. Furthermore, these data identify specific molecular mechanisms whereby both oxygen sensing mechanisms and the concentration of specific metabolites, such as fumarate, can influence the cell cycle, by affecting the activity of PHD enzymes and changing their ability to hydroxylate proline residues on novel target proteins whose modification state affects their functions in cell cycle control. This provides a new paradigm for understanding mechanisms that can integrate cell cycle regulation in cells and tissues with signals reporting on exposure of organisms to stress and other physiological cues important for homeostasis.</p>
<p>Interestingly, PHD-dependent proline modification can also be modulated in concert with other post translational protein signalling mechanisms, including phosphorylation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. Of note, P604 is next to T603, which has been shown to be phosphorylated in mitosis in previous phosphoproteomic screens <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>. It is therefore possible this phosphorylation might be impacted by P604 hydroxylation. However, additional work is needed to investigate this further.</p>
<p>We note that in addition to proteins involved in cell cycle regulation, our MS analyses of PHD target proteins has also identified sites of proline hydroxylation in many new proteins that have roles in other important cellular processes, notably including RNA processing <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. It will be interesting in future, therefore, to pursue the functional characterisation of these novel PHD targets, to help deepen an understanding of the breadth of cellular mechanisms in which post-translational modification of proteins via proline hydroxylation can modulate function.</p>
<p>There has been a degree of controversy regarding the physiological relevance of new PHD targets identified in cells, beyond HIFα, due, at least in part, to the reported lack of activity of PHDs <italic>in vitro</italic> towards hydroxylation of non-HIF1 peptides <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>. Nonetheless, evidence has been growing from a multitude of laboratories in support of functional roles for site-specific proline hydroxylation by PHDs on protein targets other than HIF1α <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. For example, Histone H3 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup> and Beclin <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup> for PHD1, AMPK <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup> and IRF3 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup> for PHD2. The data in this study clearly show the functional importance of PHD1-dependent hydroxylation of RepoMan for efficient mitotic progression, providing an important example that PHD targets are not confined to only HIF1α.</p>

<title>Proximity ligation assay (PLA)</title>
<p>Cells were transfected in 6 well plates with siRepoMan using Lipofectamine RNAimax (#13778-150 invitrogen). 14h later cells were split in media containing 2mM thymidine and 1µg/ml Doxycycline (to induce the expression of the YFP constructs) and transferred to a 96 well plate clear base (Greiner 655090) pre-coated with poly L-Lysine solution (sigma #P4707). After 24h with thymidine, cells were washed once with PBS and released in media containing 1µg/ml doxycycline and 100µM monastrol for 9h. Cells were fixed with 4% PFA for 10 min at room temperature and washed with PBS. Cells were incubated with 3% BSA in PBS plus 0.1% Triton for 30 min at room temperature and washed with PBS. From this point fixed cells were subject to Duolink PLA Fluorescent protocol according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Sigma), with some modifications. Briefly: cells were incubated with 40µL/well blocking solution 1x (DUO82007) for 45 min at 37⁰C in a humidified chamber and then incubated overnight at 4⁰C with the primary antibody (anti-GFP (1/100) plus anti-B56γ antibody diluted 1/100, or only with anti-GFP (diluted 1/100) as a negative control) in Duolink antibody diluent. After overnight incubation at 4°C in a humid chamber, samples were washed 2 times with buffer A at room temperature for 5 min. Anti mouse and anti-rabbit +/− probes were added 1:5 in Duolink antibody diluent and incubated for 1h at 37⁰C. After 2 washes with buffer A at RT the ligase was added for 30 min at 37⁰C, washed twice at RT with buffer A and polymerase together with the red fluorescent reagent was added for the amplification reaction for 100min at 37⁰C. After incubation, cells were washed at RT for 10 minutes with buffer B, 10 min with DAPI 1/1000 in PBS, 10 minutes with buffer B and 1 minute with 1/100 buffer B. After PLA assay, phSer10 antibody and secondary Alexa 647 were added to ensure that quantified cells were mitotic cells. We got similar results avoiding this step.</p>
<p>High throughput microscopy images were taken and analysed with ScanR High Content Screening Microscopy (Olympus). PLA foci per cell were detected with the foci detection package. Data shown in this work correspond with the PLA signal detected in the YFP area of each cell, that corresponds with the RepoMan signal. In addition, cells were filtered by phospho-Serine 10 positive signal. DAPI signal was used to classify cells according to their cell cycle stage (Figure S3).

<title>Quantitative analysis of immunofluorescence and chromatin loading</title>
<p>For immunofluorescence data, the following macro was run in Fiji to measure background-corrected nuclear intensity in 2 channels. Individual nuclei were identified at user-selected points of interest by auto-thresholding using the Triangle algorithm &lt;&lt;REF-GB3&gt;&gt; followed by “Fill holes”. A user-selected region of interest (ROI) was used to estimate background and calculate background-corrected total intensity for both channels, as well as normalised intensity of the second channel relative to the nuclear stain. A second macro was used to prepare data for tracking after deconvolution using SoftWoRx: 1) images were cropped to remove border artefacts, 2) for each timepoint an average projection over in-focus Z slices was performed, and 3) background subtraction was performed using a sliding paraboloid with radius=50 pixels. A final macro was used to track nuclei semi-automatically and extract intensity data for loading analysis. Single Z-section time series were tracked starting from a user-defined rectangular selection containing a single nucleus of interest. At each timepoint, a nucleus selection was identified by Otsu auto-thresholding &lt;&lt;REF-GB4&gt;&gt;, fill holes and optional watershed to split touching objects (a cost function based on area and position changes determines whether the watershed operation is beneficial). Parameters used were: minimum and maximum nucleus area (45-500µm<sup>2</sup>) and maximum frame-to-frame displacement (20 pixels, 12.68µm) corresponding to ∼0.05µm/sec. The nucleus selection was used as the ROI to measure intensity statistics in a second channel corresponding to Repo-Man protein. Analysis of image data was carried out using an ImageJ&lt;&lt;REF-GB1&gt;&gt; macros in Fiji&lt;&lt;REF-GB2&gt;&gt;.</p>
<p>For quantification of images shown in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E-F</xref> an ImageJ macro was designed to threshold and select the Chrl foci automatically and to measure the mean foci intensity of mCherry –B56 relative to YFP-RepoMan, as previously described in <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>.</p>

<p>This <bold>compelling</bold> work describes how the cell cycle-regulating phosphatase subunit, RepoMan, is regulated by the oxygen-dependent, metabolite-sensing hydroxylase PHD1. The characterisation of how proline hydroxylation alters signalling at the molecular and cellular level provides <bold>important</bold> evidence to enhance our understanding of how 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases influence the cell cycle and mitosis.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The study by Druker et al. shows that siRNA depletion of PHD1, but not PHD2, increases H3T3 phosphorylation in cells arrested in prometaphase. Additionally, the expression of wild-type RepoMan, but not the RepoMan P604A mutant, restored normal H3T3 phosphorylation localization in cells arrested in prometaphase. Furthermore, the study demonstrates that expression of the RepoMan P604A mutant leads to defects in chromosome alignment and segregation, resulting in increased cell death. These data support a role for PHD1-mediated prolyl hydroxylation in controlling progression through mitosis. This occurs, at least in part, by hydroxylating RepoMan at P604, which regulates its interaction with PP2A during chromosome alignment.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The data support most of the conclusions made. However, some issues need to be addressed.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) Although ectopically expressed PHD1 interacts with ectopically expressed RepoMan, there is no evidence that endogenous PHD1 binds to endogenous RepoMan or that PHD1 directly binds to RepoMan.</p>
<p>(2) There is no genetic evidence indicating that PHD1 controls progression through mitosis by catalyzing the hydroxylation of RepoMan.</p>
<p>(3) Data demonstrating the correlation between dynamic changes in RepoMan hydroxylation and H3T3 phosphorylation throughout the cell cycle are needed.</p>
<p>(4) The authors should provide biochemical evidence of the difference in binding ability between RepoMan WT/PP2A and RepoMan P604A/PP2A.</p>
<p>(5) PHD2 is the primary proline hydroxylase in cells. Why does PHD1, but not PHD2, affect RepoMan hydroxylation and subsequent control of mitotic progression? The authors should discuss this issue further.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This is a concise and interesting article on the role of PHD1-mediated proline hydroxylation of proline residue 604 on RepoMan and its impact on RepoMan-PP1 interactions with phosphatase PP2A-B56 complex leading to dephosphorylation of H3T3 on chromosomes during mitosis. Through biochemical and imaging tools, the authors delineate a key mechanism in the regulation of the progression of the cell cycle. The experiments performed are conclusive with well-designed controls.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors have utilized cutting-edge imaging and colocalization detection technologies to infer the conclusions in the manuscript.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Lack of in vitro reconstitution and binding data.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The manuscript is a comprehensive molecular and cell biological characterisation of the effects of P604 hydroxylation by PHD1 on RepoMan, a regulatory subunit of the PPIgamma complex. The identification and molecular characterisation of the hydroxylation site have been written up and deposited in BioRxiv in a separate manuscript. I reviewed the data and came to the conclusion that the hydroxylation site has been identified and characterised to a very high standard by LC-MS, in cells and in vitro reactions. I conclude that we should have no question about the validity of the PHD1-mediated hydroxylation.</p>
<p>In the context of the presented manuscript, the authors postulate that hydroxylation on P604 by PHD1 leads to the inactivation of the complex, resulting in the retention of pThr3 in H3.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Compelling data, characterisation of how P604 hydroxylation is likely to induce the interaction between RepoMan and a phosphatase complex, resulting in loading of RepoMan on Chromatin. Loss of the regulation of the hydroxylation site by PHD1 results in mitotic defects.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Reliance on a Proline-Alanine mutation in RepoMan to mimic an unhydroxylatable protein. The mutation will introduce structural alterations, and inhibition or knockdown of PHD1 would be necessary to strengthen the data on how hydroxylates regulate chromatin loading and interactions with B56/PP2A.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public review):</bold></p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the reviewer’s agreement that our data, &quot;<italic>support most of the conclusions made</italic>”.</p>
<p>With respect to Concerns raised by reviewer 1:</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(1) Although ectopically expressed PHD1 interacts with ectopically expressed RepoMan, there is no evidence that endogenous PHD1 binds to endogenous RepoMan or that PHD1 directly binds to RepoMan.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We do not fully agree that this comment is accurate - the implication is that we only show interaction between two exogenously expressed proteins, i.e. both exogenous  PHD1 and RepoMan, when in fact we show that tagged PHD1 interacts with endogenous RepoMan. The major technical challenge here is the well known difficulty of detetcing endogenous PHD1 in such cell lines. We agree that co-IP studies do not prove that this interaction is direct and never claim to have shown this, though we do feel that a direct interaction is most likely, albeit not proven.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) There is no genetic evidence indicating that PHD1 controls progression through mitosis by catalyzing the hydroxylation of RepoMan.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree that our current study is primarily a biochemical and cell biological study, rather than a genetic study. Nonetheless, similar biochemical and cellular approaches have been widely used and validated in previous studies in mechanisms regulating cell cycle progression and we are confident in the conclusions drawn based on the data obtained so far.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) Data demonstrating the correlation between dynamic changes in RepoMan hydroxylation and H3T3 phosphorylation throughout the cell cycle are needed.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree that it will be very interesting to analyse in more detail the cell cycle dynamics of RepoMan hydroxylation and H3T3 phosphorylation - along with other cell cycle parameters. We view this as outside the scope of our present study and are actively engaged in raising the additional funding needed to pursue such future experiments.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) The authors should provide biochemical evidence of the difference in binding ability between RepoMan WT/PP2A and RepoMan P604A/PP2A.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Here again we agree that it will be very interesting to analyse in future the detailed binding interactions between wt and mutant RepoMan and other interacting proteins, including PP2A. We view this as outside the scope of our present study and are actively engaged in raising the additional funding needed to pursue such future experiments.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) PHD2 is the primary proline hydroxylase in cells. Why does PHD1, but not PHD2, affect RepoMan hydroxylation and subsequent control of mitotic progression? The authors should discuss this issue further.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the main point underlining this comment, i.e., that there are still many things to be learned concerning the specific roles and mechanisms of the different PHD enzymes in vivo. We look forward to addressing these questions in future studies.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the reviewer’s comments that our manuscript uses biochemical and imaging tools to delineate a key mechanism in the regulation of the progression of the cell cycle and their appreciation that our experiments performed are, 'conclusive with well-designed controls.'</p>
<p>With respect to the specific Concern raised by reviewer 2:</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Lack of in vitro reconstitution and binding data.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree that it will be very interesting to pursue in vitro reconstitution studies and detailed binding data. We view this as outside the scope of our present study and are actively engaged in raising the additional funding needed to pursue such future experiments.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public review):</bold></p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the reviewer’s comments that our study, “is a comprehensive molecular and cell biological characterisation of the effects of P604 hydroxylation by PHD1 on RepoMan, a regulatory subunit of the PPIgamma complex” and their conclusion that, “we should have no question about the validity of the PHD1-mediated hydroxylation”.</p>
<p>With respect to the specific Concern raised by reviewer 3:</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Reliance on a Proline-Alanine mutation in RepoMan to mimic an unhydroxylatable protein. The mutation will introduce structural alterations, and inhibition or knockdown of PHD1 would be necessary to strengthen the data on how hydroxylates regulate chromatin loading and interactions with B56/PP2A.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We do not agree that we rely solely on analysis of the single site pro-ala mutatin in RepoMan for our conclusions, since we also present a raft of additional experimental evidence, including knock-down data and experiments using both fumarate and FG. We would also reference the data we present on RepoMan in the parallel study by Jiang et al, which has also been reviewed by eLife and is currently available on biorxiv (doi: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.05.06.652400">https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.05.06.652400</ext-link>). Of course we agree with the reviewer that even although the muatnt RepoMan features only a single amino acid change, this could still result in undetermined structural effects on the RepoMan protein that could conceivably contribute, at least in part, to some of the phenotypic effects observed. Hopefully future studies will help to clarify this.</p>
