<abstract>
<p>Rats are believed to communicate their emotional state by emitting two distinct types of ultrasonic vocalizations. The first is long “22-kHz” vocalizations (&gt;300 ms, &lt;32 kHz) with constant frequency, signaling aversive states and the second, is short “50-kHz” calls (&lt;150 ms, &gt;32 kHz), often frequency-modulated, in appetitive situations. Here we describe aversive vocalizations emitted at a higher pitch by male Wistar and spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) in an intensified aversive state – prolonged fear conditioning. These calls, which we named “44-kHz” vocalizations, are long (&gt;150 ms), generally at a constant frequency (usually within 35-50 kHz range) and have an overall spectrographic image similar to 22-kHz calls. Some 44-kHz vocalizations are comprised of both 22-kHz-like and 44-kHz-like elements. Furthermore, two separate clustering methods confirmed that these 44-kHz calls can be separated from other vocalizations. We observed 44-kHz calls to be associated with freezing behavior during fear conditioning training, during which they constituted up to 19.4% of all calls and most of them appeared next to each other forming uniform groups of vocalizations (bouts). We also show that some of rats’ responses to the playback of 44-kHz calls were more akin to that of aversive calls, e.g., heart rate changes, whereas other responses were at an intermediate level between aversive and appetitive calls. Our results suggest that rats have a wider vocal repertoire than previously believed, and current definitions of major call types may require reevaluation. We hope that future investigations of 44-kHz calls in rat models of human diseases will contribute to expanding our understanding and therapeutic strategies related to human psychiatric conditions.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Charles Darwin wrote: “That the pitch of the voice bears some relation to certain states of feeling is tolerably clear” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Darwin, 1872</xref>). This has also been tolerably clearly observed and widely described for ultrasonic vocalizations of rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Brudzynski, 2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Brudzynski, 2021</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Simola and Granon, 2019</xref>) which emit low-pitched aversive calls and high-pitched appetitive calls. The former are “22-kHz” vocalizations (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figs 1A</xref>, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2A</xref>), with 18 to 32 kHz frequency range, monotonous and long, usually &gt;300 ms, and are uttered in distress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Brudzynski, 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Brudzynski, 2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Brudzynski, 2021</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Simola and Granon, 2019</xref>). The latter are “50-kHz” vocalizations (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>), are relatively short (10-150 ms), frequency-modulated, usually within 35-80 kHz, and they signal appetitive and rewarding states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Simola and Granon, 2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Brudzynski, 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Brudzynski, 2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Brudzynski, 2021</xref>). Therefore, these two types of calls communicate the animal’s emotional state to their social group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Brudzynski, 2013</xref>). Low-pitch (&lt;32 kHz), short (&lt;300 ms; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>) calls, assumed to also express a negative aversive state, have been described but their role is not clearly established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Brudzynski, 2013</xref>). Notably, high-pitch (&gt;32 kHz), long and monotonous ultrasonic vocalizations have not yet been described. Here we show these unmodulated rat vocalizations with peak frequency<sup>1</sup> at about 44 kHz (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figs 1B</xref>, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1E</xref>, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2B</xref>), emitted in aversive experimental situations, especially in prolonged fear conditioning.</p>

These vocalizations, e.g., top-right group in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figs 1B</xref> and 1S1C, were outside the defined range (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Brudzynski, 2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Brudzynski, 2021</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Simola and Granon, 2019</xref>) for both 50-kHz (bottom-right group in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figs 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1_1">1S1A-C</xref>) and 22-kHz calls (top-left group in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figs 1A</xref>, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1_1">1S1A-C</xref>). These vocalizations were also observed in a different rat strain acquired from a different breeding colony, i.e., spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Okamoto and Aoki, 1963</xref>), also trained in delay fear conditioning (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Tab. 1</xref>/Exp. 2/#10-12; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Olszyński et al., 2022</xref>). Six of the 49 conditioned SHR displayed high-pitch, long, monotonous vocalizations (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2_1">Fig. 2S1G</xref>); moreover, we observed more of these vocalizations in Wistar rats compared to SHR (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Tab. 1</xref>/Exp. 2/#6-8,10-12) in both training, p &lt; 0.0001, and test sessions, p = 0.0030, Mann-Whitney.</p>
<p>Overall, we analyzed 140,149 vocalizations from all fear conditioning experiments (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Tab. 1</xref>/Exp. 1-3/#1-13, n = 218) and through trial-and-error, we set <bold>new criteria,</bold> namely <bold>peak frequency of &gt;32 kHz and &gt;150 ms duration</bold> to define the calls described above. We manually verified the results on the spectrogram using these parameters and only 308 calls (0.2%) were incorrectly assigned (i.e., exceptionally long 50-kHz vocalizations misplaced in the newly-defined group or borderline-short vocalizations of the newly-defined group misplaced to 50-kHz calls). Hence the new parameters correctly assigned 99.8% of cases and are thus effective to distinguish the newly-defined calls in an automated fashion. Finally, 10,445 newly-defined calls were identified, which constituted 7.5% of the total calls during fear conditioning experiments (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Tab. 1</xref>/Exp. 1-3; comp. <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1G</xref>). These vocalizations have a peak frequency range from 32.2 to 51.5 kHz (95% of cases) with an average peak frequency of 42.1 kHz, and they exhibited 43.8 kHz peak frequency at the cluster center in a DBSCAN analysis (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). In line with the accepted nomenclature convention, underlining the relationship with 22-kHz vocalizations, we christened this newly-defined calls as “<bold>44-kHz vocalizations</bold>”.</p>

<title>44-kHz calls in long aversive stimulation</title>
<p>We found 44-kHz vocalizations especially in rats which received multiple electric shocks. When we analyzed all Wistar rats that had undergone 10 trials of fear conditioning (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Tab. 1</xref>/Exp. 1-3/#2,4,8,13; n = 46), these vocalizations were less frequent following the first trial (1.2 ± 0.4% of all calls), and increased in subsequent trials, particularly after the 5<sup>th</sup> (8.8 ± 2.8%), through the 9<sup>th</sup> (19.4 ± 5.5%, the highest value), to the 10<sup>th</sup> (15.5 ± 4.9%) trials, where 44-kHz calls gradually replaced 22-kHz vocalizations in some rats (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1_2">1S2AB</xref>, Video 1; comp <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref> vs. 1E). Please note, majority of the 22-kHz calls were emitted after the 3<sup>rd</sup> shock, i.e., during the 3<sup>rd</sup> ITI (inter-trial-interval), while 44-kHz vocalizations were emitted in the second part of the training, i.e., 5<sup>th</sup> to 10<sup>th</sup> ITI (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F</xref>, comp. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1_2">Fig. 1S2AB</xref>). From this group of rats (n = 46), n = 41 (89.1%) emitted long 22-kHz calls, and 32 of them (69.6%) emitted 44-kHz calls, i.e., every animal that produced 44-kHz calls also emitted long 22-kHz calls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1_2">Fig. 1S2AB</xref>). The prevalence of 44-kHz calls varied greatly among individual rats, such that for n = 3 rats, 44-kHz vocalizations accounted for &gt;95% of all calls during at least one ITI (e.g., 140 of total 142, 222 of 231, and 263 of 265 tallied 44-kHz calls), and in n = 9 rats, 44-kHz vocalizations constituted &gt;50% of calls in more than one ITI. The prevalence of 44-kHz calls in all experimental conditions analyzed in all animal groups is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1_3">Fig. 1S3</xref>.</p>
<p>Notably, there were more 44-kHz vocalizations during fear conditioning training than testing in all fear-conditioned Wistar rats (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Tab. 1</xref>/Exp. 1-3/#2,4,6-8,13; n = 84; 3.63 ± 0.99 vs. 0.23 ± 0.13 calls/min; p &lt; 0.0001; Wilcoxon).</p>
<p>In a recent publication during this paper’s review process, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Gonzalez-Palomares et al.

<title>Changes in frequency, duration, and mean power of long aversive calls during conditioning</title>
<p>Analyzing Wistar rats that undergone 10 trials of fear conditioning (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Tab. 1</xref>/Exp. 1-3/#2,4,8,13; n = 46), we also observed the frequencies of 22-kHz calls to gradually rise throughout fear conditioning training, i.e., during subsequent ITI – from 24.5 ± 0.1 to 27.9 ± 0.4 kHz (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figs 1DE</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1_2">1S2C</xref>; p &lt; 0.0001, Friedman, p = 0.0039, Wilcoxon). The frequency levels of 44-kHz vocalizations also appeared to rise – from 37.8 ± 2.1 to 39.6 ± 1.3 kHz (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figs 1E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1_2">1S2C</xref>) but we were unable to statistically demonstrate it (p = 0.0155, Friedman, p = 0.0977, Wilcoxon).</p>
<p>There was a shortening of long 22-kHz calls during the first four ITI from 969.6 ± 43.1 ms to 794.6 ± 39.8 ms (p &lt; 0.0001, Friedman; p &lt; 0.0001, Wilcoxon, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1_2">Fig. 1S2D</xref>), while 44-kHz vocalizations were longest during the 4<sup>th</sup> ITI (the time of their substantial appearance, comp. <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F</xref>), i.e., 775.0 ± 135.7 ms, and shortened over subsequent ITI (619.6 ± 58.1 ms for the 10<sup>th</sup> ITI, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1_2">Fig. 1S2D</xref>, p = 0.0227, Friedman; p = 0.0234, Wilcoxon).</p>
<p>Finally, the sound mean power of 44-kHz vocalizations appeared to remain stable throughout the 10-trial sessions, while during the first half of the training, i.e., 1<sup>st</sup>-5<sup>th</sup> ITI, 22-kHz calls were not only significantly more frequent but also louder than during the second half, i.e., 6<sup>th</sup>-10<sup>th</sup> ITI (p &lt; 0.0001, Wilcoxon). Consequently, long 22-kHz calls appeared louder than 44-kHz calls (p = 0.0397-0.0038, Mann-Whitney). However, in the second half of the session, this difference dissipated due to the diminishing amplitude of 22-kHz vocalizations (p = 0.0083, Friedman; p = 0.0046, Wilcoxon), while the amplitude of 44-kHz calls remained stable (p = 0.0663, Friedman; p = 0.2661, Wilcoxon; 6<sup>th</sup> ITI through 10<sup>th</sup> ITI for both; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1_2">Fig. 1S2E</xref>). After adjusting for angle-dependent hardware attenuation (see Methods, Sound mean power), the situation reversed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1_2">Fig. 1S2F</xref>). Both long 22-kHz and 44-kHz vocalizations showed similar amplitude levels during the first half of the fear conditioning session, while during the 6<sup>th</sup>-10<sup>th</sup> ITI, 44-kHz calls were significantly louder than long 22-kHz calls (p = 0.0007-0.0097, Mann-Whitney).</p>

<title>44-kHz calls linked to freezing</title>
<p>We investigated the freezing behavior of all Wistar rats emitting 44-kHz vocalizations during 10 trials of fear conditioning (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Tab. 1</xref>/Exp. 1-3/#2,4,8,13; n = 46). The training sessions were divided into 10-s-long time bins, from which we analyzed only the bins that had exclusively long 22-kHz or 44-kHz calls. For comparison, we also measured the freezing levels during the first 5 min of the trial (baseline freezing levels before any foot-shocks) as well as the bins in which animals did not vocalize (from the period after the 1<sup>st</sup> shock to the end of the session). Of the n = 46 rats analyzed, n = 41 emitted 22-kHz vocalizations, from which n = 32 also emitted 44-kHz vocalizations, from which only n = 21 were determined to have both – 10-s-long bins of 22-kHz calls only and 44-kHz calls only (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Tab. 2A</xref>). Freezing during the bins of 22-kHz calls only (p &lt; 0.0001, for both groups) and during 44-kHz calls only bins (p = 0.0003) was higher than during the first 5 min baseline freezing levels of the session. Also, the freezing associated with emissions of 44-kHz calls only was higher than during bins with no ultrasonic vocalizations (p = 0.0353), and it was also 9.9 percentage points higher than during time bins with only long 22-kHz vocalizations, but the difference was not significant (p = 0.1907; all Wilcoxon).</p>
<p>To further investigate this potential difference, we measured freezing during the emission of randomly selected single 44-kHz and 22-kHz vocalizations. The minimal freezing behavior detection window was reduced to compensate for the higher resolution of the measurements (3, 5, 10, or 15 video frames were used). There was no difference in freezing during the emission of 44-kHz vs. 22-kHz vocalizations for ≥150-ms-long calls (3 frames, p = 0.2054) and for ≥500-ms-long calls (5 frames, p = 0.2404; 10 frames, p = 0.4498; 15 frames, p = 0.7776; all Wilcoxon, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Tab. 2</xref>B).</p>

<title>44-kHz calls sorted into five subtypes</title>
<p>While the majority of 44-kHz vocalizations were of continuous unmodulated frequency (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>), some comprised additional elements. Based on the composition of individual call elements and their relation to each other, we manually sorted the calls into five categories (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B-F</xref>). If the start (<italic>prefix</italic>) or end (<italic>suffix</italic>) portion of a call was less than 1/5<sup>th</sup> the length of the following or previous element, this portion of the call was not considered in its categorization into the five subtypes. The names and descriptions of the five subtypes are: <bold>flat</bold> – single element with near constant frequency and little to no interruptions to the sound continuity on the spectrogram; <bold>step up</bold> – two elements with an instantaneous frequency jump, where the first element is of lower frequency; <bold>step down</bold> – two elements with an instantaneous frequency jump, where the first element is of higher frequency; <bold>insert</bold> – three elements with an instantaneous frequency change, where the middle element is of different frequency; <bold>complex</bold> – more than three elements with instantaneous frequency changes.</p>

<title>44-kHz and 22-kHz calls closely related</title>
<p>44-kHz were emitted in aversive behavioral situations – as 22-kHz calls are observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Antoniadis and McDonald, 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Dupin et al., 2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Taylor et al., 2017</xref>). Both types of calls are long (usually &gt;300 ms) and frequency-unmodulated. Some of the elements constituting such as step up; step down; insert and complex 44-kHz vocalizations (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C-F</xref>) were at a lower frequency – typical for 22-kHz vocalizations. <italic>Vice versa</italic> we also observed 22-kHz calls with 44-kHz-like elements. Therefore, we propose that these long 22-kHz and 44-kHz vocalizations constitute a <italic>supertype</italic> group of long unmodulated aversive calls (“long 22/44-kHz vocalizations”).</p>
<p>We observed a stable, approximately 1.5 ratio in peak frequency levels between 22-kHz and 44-kHz vocalizations within individual rats. Specifically, in fourteen rats (13 Wistar and 1 SHR) with a clear transition from 22-kHz to 44-kHz calls during the fear conditioning session (n = 14, selected from <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Tab. 1</xref>/Exp. 1-3/#2,4,6-8,10-13), the proportion between the frequencies of the long 22-kHz vocalizations and the long 44-kHz calls was 1.48 ± 0.02. Similar results were obtained for 70 step up (1.53 ± 0.03) and 65 step down (1.59 ± 0.02) 44-kHz calls – altogether suggesting a 1.5-times or 3:2 frequency ratio. This ratio and its relevance has been observed in invertebrates and vertebrates including human speech and music (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Hoeschele, 2017</xref>). In music theory, 3:2 frequency ratio is referred to as a perfect fifth and is often featured, e.g., the first two notes of the <italic>Star Wars</italic> 1977 movie (ascending, i.e., step up; comp. <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>, Track 1) and <italic>Game of Thrones</italic> 2011 television series (descending, i.e., step down; comp. <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>, Track 2) theme songs. All of which may point to a common basis for this sound interval and its prevalence which could be explained by the observation that all physical objects capable of producing tonal sounds generate harmonic vibrations, the most prominent being the octave, perfect fifth, and major third (Christensen, 1993, discussed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bowling and Purves, 2015</xref>).</p>

<title>44-kHz calls separated in cluster analyses</title>
<p>Next, we showed that 44-kHz calls indeed constitute a separable type of ultrasonic vocalizations as it was sorted into isolated clusters by two different methods. First, using the DBSCAN algorithm method based on calls’ peak frequency and duration, we were able to divide all vocalizations recorded during all training sessions into 44-kHz vocalizations vs. all other vocalizations as two separate clusters (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). Secondly, a clustering algorithm that includes call contours, i.e., k-means with UMAP projection done via DeepSqueak (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figs 3BC</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3_1">3S1</xref>), sorted 44-kHz vocalizations of different subtypes including unusual ones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2_1">Fig. 2S1A-F</xref>), into topologically-separate groups.

<title>44-kHz calls formed separate groups</title>
<p>We have examined transition probabilities for call-type transitions within all vocalizations and within vocalization bouts in all Wistar rats during 10 trials of fear conditioning training (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Tab. 1</xref>/Exp. 1-3/#2,4,8,13; n = 46). Transition probabilities between vocalization types were defined by counting the number of specific pair sequences and dividing by all observed sequence pairs where the first type of signal is followed by any signal. The most probable call following long 22-kHz vocalization was another long 22-kHz vocalization (94.4% probability). Similarly, the most probable call following 44-kHz vocalization was another 44-kHz call (83.1%). These values augmented when the analysis was limited to vocalizations emitted only in bouts, i.e., with &lt;320 ms time gaps between calls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Wöhr et al., 2005</xref>), and reached 96.3% and 86.5%, respectively.

<title>Response to 44-kHz playback</title>
<p>To describe the behavioral and physiological impact of 44-kHz vocalizations, we performed playback experiments in two separate groups of rats (Methods, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figs 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4_1">4S1</xref>). Overall, the responses to 44-kHz aversive calls presented from the speaker were either similar to 22-kHz vocalizations or in-between responses to 22-kHz and 50-kHz playbacks. For example, the heart rate of rats exposed to 22-kHz and 44-kHz vocalizations decreased, and increased to 50-kHz calls (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>, comp. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Olszyński et al., 2020</xref>). Whereas the number of vocalizations emitted by rats was highest during and after the playback of 50-kHz, intermediate to 44-kHz and lowest to 22-kHz playbacks (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figs 4BC</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4_1">4S1EF</xref>). Additionally, the duration of 50-kHz vocalizations emitted in response to 44-kHz playback was also intermediate, i.e., longer than following 22-kHz playback (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref>) and shorter than following 50-kHz playback (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figs 4D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4_1">4S1G</xref>).

However, since the increase in vocalization was robust in case of 50-kHz playback, the number of emitted vocalizations was higher than after 22-kHz playback (e.g., p &lt; 0.0001 during 0-30 time-intervals) as well as after 44-kHz playback (e.g., p &lt; 0.0001 during 0-10 time-intervals, both Mann-Whitney).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>As Charles Darwin noted above (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Darwin, 1872</xref>) and other researchers have confirmed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Briefer et al., 2012</xref>), the frequency level of animal calls is a vocal parameter that changes in accordance with its arousal state (intensity) or emotional valence (positive/negative state). The frequency shifts towards both higher and lower levels, i.e., alterations were observed during both positive (appetitive) and negative (agonistic/aversive) situations, however, as a general rule, frequency usually increases with an increase in arousal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Briefer et al., 2012</xref>). We would like to propose a hypothesis that our prolonged fear conditioning increased the arousal of the rats with no change in the valence of the aversive stimuli.</p>
<p>It could also be speculated that several other factors, apart from increased arousal, contributed to the emergence of 44-kHz vocalizations in our fear-conditioned rats, e.g., heightened fear, stress/anxiety, annoyance/anger, disgust/boredom, grief/sadness, despair/helplessness, and weariness/fatigue. It is not possible, at this stage, to definitively determine which factors played a decisive role. Please note that the potential contribution of these factors is not mutually exclusive.</p>
<p>However, several arguments support the idea that 44-kHz vocalizations communicate an increased negative emotional state. First, in general, ultrasonic vocalizations serve as a means of communicating rats’ emotional state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Brudzynski, 2013</xref>). Second, the changing of <italic>the pitch of the voice bears some relation to certain states of feeling</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Darwin, 1872</xref>). Third, 44-kHz calls were notably more frequent during prolonged aversive stimulation, i.e., the 5<sup>th</sup>-10<sup>th</sup> trials of fear conditioning. Fourth, they were linked to freezing. Fifth, they appeared as partial replacements of, established as aversive, 22-kHz calls – in the presence of the same painful stimulus. Sixth, numerous instances of vocalizations featured both 22-kHz-like and 44-kHz-like call-elements.</p>
<p>Also, several observations contradict the potential contribution of fatigue. The sound mean power of 44-kHz vocalizations was comparable to, or possibly even higher than, that of 22-kHz calls, despite the higher energy costs associated with producing higher-pitched calls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Sonninen and Hurme, 1998</xref>), i.e., the rats emitting 44-kHz calls invested additional energy to communicate their emotional state; both <italic>in vivo</italic> measurements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Riede, 2013</xref>) and computer modelling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Hakansson et al., 2022</xref>) demonstrated that producing calls of higher frequency, such as 50 kHz vs. 22 kHz, requires increased activity of various muscles. Additionally, the mean power of 44-kHz vocalizations remained strong and stable for several trials – in contrast to 22-kHz vocalizations. Finally, when 44-kHz calls started to appear in significant numbers, i.e., after the 4<sup>th</sup>-5<sup>th</sup> trials of fear conditioning, they were as long as 22-kHz vocalizations.</p>
<p>Concerning the latter, we observed a significant decrease in the mean power of 22-kHz vocalizations during the fear conditioning session. Such reduction could potentially be attributed to fatigue (as observed in humans, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Kitch and Oates, 1994</xref>), despair (e.g., as a reaction to the lack of effects from repeated emissions of 22-kHz calls), or both. The reduction in the amplitude of 22-kHz calls during the 10-trial fear conditioning was also recently observed by others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Gonzalez-Palomares et al., 2023</xref>).</p>
<p>Importantly, it has been demonstrated multiple times that training rats with several electric foot-shocks (i.e., 5-10 shocks) produces a qualitatively different kind of fear-memory compared to training with only 1-2 shocks. Training with more numerous shocks has been shown to result in augmented freezing (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Fanselow and Bolles, 1979</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Haubrich et al., 2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Haubrich and Nader, 2023</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Poulos et al., 2016</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Wang et al., 2009</xref>) which reflects a more intense fear-memory that is resistant to extinction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Haubrich et al., 2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Haubrich and Nader, 2023</xref>), resistant to reconsolidation blockade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Haubrich et al., 2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Wang et al., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Finnie and Nader, 2020</xref>), associated with downregulation of NR2B NMDA-receptor subunits as well as elevated amyloid-beta concentrations in the lateral and basal amygdala (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Finnie and Nader, 2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Wang et al., 2009</xref>). Additionally, it involves activation of the noradrenaline-locus coeruleus system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Haubrich et al., 2020</xref>) and collective changes in connectivity across multiple brain regions within the neural network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Haubrich and Nader, 2023</xref>).</p>
<p>Notably, it has also been shown that higher freezing as a result of fear-conditioning training correlates with increased concentrations of stress hormone, corticosterone, in the blood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Dos Santos Correa et al., 2019</xref>). The rats subjected to 6- and 10-trial fear conditioning, whose results are reported herein (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Tab. 1</xref>/Exp. 2/#7,8,11,12; n = 73), also demonstrated higher freezing than rats subjected to 1-trial conditioning (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Tab. 1</xref>/Exp. 2/#6,10; n = 33), which is reported elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Olszynski et al., 2021</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1_1">Fig. S1C-E</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Olszynski et al., 2022</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1_1">Fig. S1D-G</xref>). Therefore, we postulate that emission of 44-kHz calls is associated with increased stress and the training regime forming robust memories.</p>
<p>Amounting research points to the utility of rat ultrasonic vocalizations to alter emotional states, evidenced by behavioral changes, in tested rats <italic>via</italic> playback of affectively valenced calls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Bonauto et al., 2023</xref>). We have exposed rats to 44-kHz playback along with 22-kHz and 50-kHz playback. The experimental design (see methods for details) allowed us to compare rats’ responses to 22-kHz vs. 44-kHz playbacks especially – with 50-kHz playback used as a form of control or baseline. In general, the rats responded similarly to hearing 44-kHz calls as they did to hearing aversive 22-kHz calls, especially regarding heart-rate change, despite the 44-kHz calls occupying the frequency band of appetitive 50-kHz vocalizations. This is contrary to some observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Saito et al., 2019</xref>) which suggested that frequency band plays the main role in rat ultrasound perception. Please factor in potential carry-over effects (resulting from hearing playbacks of the same valence in a row) in the differences between responses to 50-kHz vs. 22/44-kHz playbacks, especially, those observed before the signal (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4AB</xref>). Other responses to 44-kHz calls were intermediate, they fell between response levels to appetitive vs. aversive playback, which might signify some behavioral specificity and importance (or possibly confusion). These latter effects were similar in both playback experiments despite an array of methodological differences between them. Overall, these initial results raise further questions about how, ethologically, animals may interpret the variation in hearing 22-kHz vs. 44-kHz calls and integrate this interpretation in their responses.</p>
<p>The question also is, why have the 44-kHz vocalizations been overlooked until now? On one hand, long (or not that long as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Biały et al., 2019</xref>), frequency-stable high-pitch vocalizations have been reported before (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Sales, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Shimoju et al., 2020</xref>), notably as caused by intense cholinergic stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Brudzynski and Bihari, 1990</xref>) or higher shock-dose fear conditioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Wöhr et al., 2005</xref>). However, they have not been systematically defined, described, fully shown or demonstrated to be a separate type of vocalization. On the other hand, 44-kHz calls were likely omitted as the analyses were restricted to canonical groups, i.e. flat 22-kHz and short 50-kHz calls, with a sharp dividing frequency border between the two (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Kalamari et al., 2021</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Potasiewicz et al., 2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Turner et al., 2019</xref>) or even a frequency ‘safety gap’ between 22-kHz and 50-kHz vocalizations (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Silkstone and Brudzynski, 2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Garcia et al., 2015</xref>). Moreover – many older bat-detectors had limited frequency-range detection (e.g., up to 40 kHz in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Sales, 1991</xref>), when stress-evoked types of ultrasonic calls were being established. Finally, 44-kHz vocalizations are emitted much fewer than 22-kHz calls (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1FG</xref>).</p>
<p>Here we present introductory evidence that 44-kHz vocalizations are a separate and behaviorally-relevant group of rat ultrasonic calls. These results require further confirmations and additional experiments, also in form of replication, including research on female rat subjects. However, our results bring to awareness that rats employ these previously unrecognized, long, high-pitched and flat aversive calls in their vocal repertoire. Researchers investigating rat ultrasonic vocalizations should be aware of their potential presence and to not rely fully on automated detection of high vs. low-pitch calls.</p>

Ultrasonic vocalizations were recorded via Avisoft USGH Recorder (Avisoft Bioacoustics), and rat behavior was recorded via NIR monochrome camera (VID-CAM-MONO-6, Med Associates). All procedures were described in detail before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Olszyński et al., 2021</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Olszyński et al., 2022</xref>).</p>
<sec id="s4d1">
<title>Trace fear conditioning</title>
<p>(<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Tab. 1</xref>/Exp. 1/#1-4, n = 34 rats) was performed similarly to some previous reports (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Jahołkowski et al., 2009</xref>). Rats were individually placed in the fear conditioning apparatus in one of two different contexts: A (safe) or B (unsafe). Context A was in an illuminated room with the cage interior with white light, the cage floor was made of solid plastic, and the cage was scented with lemon odor, cleaned with a 10% ethanol solution; the experimenter was male wearing white gloves. Context B was a different, dark room, with the cage interior with green light, the floor was made of metal bars, and the cage was scented with mint odor, cleaned with 1% acetic acid; the experimenter was female with violet gloves. The procedure: on day -2, each rat was habituated to context A for 20 min; on day -1, habituated to context B for 20 min; on day 0, each rat was placed for 52 min in context A; on day 1, after 10 min in context B, the rat received 10 conditioning stimuli (15-s-long sine wave tone, 5 kHz, 85 dB) followed by a 30 s trace period and a foot-shock (1 s, 1 mA) and 210 s inter-trial interval, i.e., ITI; total session duration: 52 min. Control rats were subjected to the same procedures but did not receive the electric shock at the end of trace periods. The animals were tested with the same protocol without shocks in context A (day 2) and context B (day 3). During the test session, control animals showed a lower level of freezing than conditioned animals (1.3 ± 0.8% vs. 19.7 ± 4.3% during the first 5 min in unsafe context B and 0.4 ± 0.3% vs. 9.9 ± 1.9% during 10 s following the time of expected shock in context B, results averaged from the first 3 out of 10 trials; p = 0.0003 and p = 0.0001, respectively, Mann-Whitney); none of the control animals emitted 44-kHz calls, neither the fear conditioning day nor the test days.</p>

For control rats, an equal time-length procedure was done for each conditioning protocol, i.e., the same parameters as in 1, 6 or 10 stimuli groups, with no shock. Control animals showed a lower level of freezing than conditioned animals. There were only 4 ultrasonic calls we classified as 44-kHz vocalizations among 4,126 vocalizations emitted by the control rats during training and testing. We did not observe any difference in the number of 44-kHz vocalizations between Wistar rats with transmitters vs. without transmitters during delay conditioning training (p = 0.8642, Mann-Whitney). These two groups were therefore reported together.</p>

<title>Measuring freezing</title>
<p>Freezing behavior was scored automatically using Video Freeze software (Med Associates) with a default motion index threshold of 18. To avoid including brief moments of the animal’s stillness, freezing was measured only if the animal did not move for at least 1 s, i.e., 30 video frames, with some exceptions, see next.</p>
<sec id="s4e1">
<title>Vocalization-nested freezing behavior</title>
<p>Freezing at the exact times of ultrasonic calling was measured in rats that had undergone 10 trials of fear conditioning which produced 44-kHz calls (n = 32, selected from <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Tab. 1</xref>/Exp. 1-3/#2,4,8,13). From each rat, one 44-kHz call was randomly selected along with the long 22-kHz call closest to it. Such pairs of vocalizations were selected with either ≥150 ms duration (n = 32) or ≥500 ms duration (n = 28). For each pair of vocalizations, the freezing behavior was calculated from the entire duration of the shorter call and for the equal-time-length period in the middle of the longer vocalization. Due to the shortened time-scale, the minimal freezing detection window was reduced to 3 frames for ≥150-ms-long calls as well as 5, 10, and 15 frames – for ≥500-ms calls.</p>

Calls were presented with a sampling rate of 250 kHz in 16-bit format. All calls except for 50-kHz mixed calls were collected in our laboratory from fear conditioning or playback experiments.

<title>Playback procedure, rats with transmitters</title>

Before playback presentation, animals were habituated for 3 min to the experimental conditions, i.e., recording cage, presence of the speaker and microphone, over 4 days. Habituated rats then underwent a playback procedure, in short, after 10 min of silence, the rats were exposed to four 10-s-long call sets (either aversive or appetitive) with 5-min-long ITI in-between; a rat that received appetitive playback was followed by a rat receiving aversive playbacks etc. Also, the order of the presented sets was randomized between animals. The aversive-calls playback contained sets nos. 1-4. The appetitive-calls playback contained sets nos. 5-8. Since initial analysis showed no differences within responses to 22-kHz aversive sets and within responses to 50-kHz appetitive sets, we decided to show the results following playback of 44-kHz long calls (set no. 1), 22-kHz long calls (set no. 2), and 50-kHz modulated calls (set no. 5) only.</p>

<title>Playback procedure, rats without transmitters</title>
<p>Before playback presentation, animals were habituated for 3 min to the experimental conditions, i.e., recording cage, presence of the speaker and microphone, over 4 days. After 5 min of initial silence, the rats were presented with two 10-s-long playback sets of either 22-kHz (set no. 2; n = 8) or 44-kHz calls (set no. 1; n = 8), followed by one 50-kHz modulated call 10-s set (no. 5) and another two playback sets of either 44-kHz or 22-kHz calls not previously heard.

<title>Analysis of ultrasonic vocalizations</title>
<p>Audio recordings were analyzed manually using SASLab Pro (version 5.2.xx, Avisoft Bioacoustics) as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Olszyński et al., 2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Olszyński et al., 2021</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Olszyński et al., 2022</xref>) to measure key features of calls and categorize them into subtypes.</p>
<p><bold>Sound mean power</bold> was measured as the average spectra power density of the vocalization contour using DeepSqueak software. Initially, calls were detected using the default rat long-vocalization neural network (Long Rat Detector YOLO R1) and subsequently manually reviewed and corrected where necessary. We analyzed a subset of Wistar rats subjected to 10-trial fear conditioning that emitted more than 20 instances of 44-kHz calls during the fear conditioning session (n = 17, selected from <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Tab. 1</xref>/Exp. 1-3/#2,4,8,13). It is important to note that due to the directional characteristics of the microphones used, angular attenuation occurred during audio recording. This phenomenon results in a selective reduction in the intensity of higher frequency sounds, dependent on the angle between the sound emitter and the microphone (as specified in the CM16/CMPA microphone hardware specification page, Avisoft Bioacoustics website). In our experimental setup, we approximated a 45° angle between the plane of the rat’s head and the plane of the microphone’s membrane. This angle corresponds to an estimated 10 dB attenuation (adopting a conservative estimate) of 40-kHz frequencies compared to 20-kHz frequencies for which there is even a small dB gain due to these hardware properties, 44-kHz calls are predicted to be approximately at least 10 dB louder in reality than what was recorded.</p>

To avoid detecting small clusters, we limited MinPts to 150 samples. The heuristic method described by Ester et al.

<p>Olszyński et al. claim that they identified a &quot;new-type&quot; ultrasonic vocalization around 44 kHz that occurs in response to prolonged fear conditioning (using foot-shocks of relatively high intensity, i.e. 1 mA) in rats. Typically, negative 22-kHz calls and positive 50-kHz calls are distinguished in rats, commonly by using a frequency threshold of 30 or 32 kHz. Olszyński et al. now observed so-called &quot;44-kHz&quot; calls in a substantial number of subjects exposed to 10 tone-shock pairings, yet call emission rate was low (according to Fig. 1G around 15%, according to the result text around 7.5%). They also performed playback experiments and concluded that &quot;the responses to 44-kHz aversive calls presented from the speaker were either similar to 22-kHz vocalizations or in-between responses to 22-kHz and 50-kHz playbacks&quot;.</p>
<p>Strengths: Detailed spectrographic analysis of a substantial data set of ultrasonic vocalizations recorded during prolonged fear conditioning, combined with playback experiments.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the previous reviews.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>The exclusive use of males is a major concern lacking adequate justification and should be disclosed in the title and abstract to ensure readers are aware of this limitation. With several reported sex differences in rat vocal behaviors this means caution should be exercised when generalizing from these findings. The occurrence of an estrus cycle in typical female rats is not justification for their exclusion. Note also that male rodents experience great variability in hormonal states as well, distinguishing between individuals and within individuals across time. The study of endocrinological influences on behavior can be separated from the study of said behavior itself, across all sexes. Similarly, concerns about needing to increase the number of animals when including all sexes are usually unwarranted (see Shansky [2019] and Phillips et al. [2023]).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As suggested by the Reviewer, we have disclosed the use of males in the title and the abstract. Also, we have added the statement that research on female rat subjects is required: “Here we are showing introductory evidence that 44-kHz vocalizations are a separate and behaviorally-relevant group of rat ultrasonic calls. These results require further confirmations and additional experiments, also in form of repetition, including research on female rat subjects.”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Regarding the analysis where calls were sorted using DBSCAN based on peak frequency and duration, my comment on the originally reviewed version stands. It seems that the calls are sorted by an (unbiased) algorithm into categories based on their frequency and duration, and because 44kHz calls differ by definition on frequency and duration the fact that the algorithm sorts them as a distinct category is not evidence that they are &quot;new calls [that] form a separate, distinct group&quot;. I appreciate that the authors have softened their language regarding the novelty and distinctness of these calls, but the manuscript contains several instances where claims of novelty and specificity (e.g. the subtitle on line 193) is emphasized beyond what the data justifies.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We further softened our language regarding novelty and distinctness of 44-kHz vocalizations – including the aforementioned subtitle. However, in response, we would like to bring to the readers’ attention that all major groups of calls, i.e., long 22-kHz calls, short 22-kHz calls, and 50-kHz vocalization, are also defined in our manuscript and in the literature by their frequency and duration. However not one of these groups was identified separately by DBSCAN clustering excepting the 44kHz vocalizations. If they were not a distinct group, we would expect the 44-kHz and 50-kHz vocalizations to blend first (because of the similar frequencies) or 44-kHz and 22-kHz calls to merge first (because of the similar durations), but they do not in this unbiased examination.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The behavioral response to call playback is intriguing, although again more in line with the hypothesis that these are not a distinct type of call but merely represent expected variation in vocalization parameters. Across the board animals respond rather similarly to hearing 22 kHz calls as they do to hearing 44 kHz calls, with occasional shifts of 44 kHz call responses to an intermediate between appetitive and aversive calls. This does raise interesting questions about how, ethologically, animals may interpret such variation and integrate this interpretation in their responses. However, the categorical approach employed here does not address these questions fully.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This paragraph is exactly the same as in the previous review. There was no comment regarding our previous answer. Here is the previous answer:</p>
<p>“We are unsure of the Reviewer’s critique in this paragraph and will attempt to address it to the best of our understanding. Our finding of up to &gt;19% of long seemingly aversive, 44-kHz calls, at a frequency in the define appetitive ultrasonic range (usually &gt;32 kHz) is unexpected rather than “expected”. We would agree that aversive call variation is expected, but not in the appetitive frequency range.</p>
<p>Kindly note the findings by Saito et al. (2019), which claim that frequency band plays the main role in rat ultrasonic perception. It is possible that the higher peak frequency of 44-kHz calls may be a strong factor in their perception by rats, which is, however, modified by the longer duration and the lack of modulation.</p>
<p>Also, from our experience, it is quite challenging to demonstrate different behavioral responses of naïve rats to pre-recorded 22-kHz (aversive) vs. 50-kHz (appetitive) vocalizations. Therefore, to demonstrate a difference in response to two distinct, potentially aversive, calls, i.e., 22kHz vs. 44-kHz calls, to be even more difficult (as to our knowledge, a comparable experiment between short vs. long 22-kHz ultrasonic vocalizations, has not been done before).</p>
<p>Therefore, we do not take lightly the surprising and interesting finding that “animals respond rather similarly to hearing 22 kHz calls as they do to hearing 44 kHz calls, with occasional shifts of 44 kHz call responses to an intermediate between appetitive and aversive calls”. We would rather put this description in analogous words: “the rats responded similarly to hearing 44-kHz calls as they did to hearing aversive 22-kHz calls, especially regarding heart-rate change, despite the 44-kHz calls occupying the frequency band of appetitive 50-kHz vocalizations” and “other responses to 44-kHz calls were intermediate, they fell between response levels to appetitive vs. aversive playback” – which we added to the Discussion.</p>
<p>Finally, we acknowledge that our findings do not present a finite and complete picture of the discussed aspects of behavioral responses to the presented ultrasonic stimuli (44-kHz vocalizations). Therefore, we have incorporated the Reviewer’s suggestion in the discussion. The added sentence reads: “Overall, these initial results raise further questions about how, ethologically, animals may interpret the variation in hearing 22-kHz vs. 44-kHz calls and integrate this interpretation in their responses.”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>I appreciate the amendment in discussing the idea of arousal being the key determinant for the increased emission of 44kHz, and the addition of other factors. Some of the items in this list, such as annoyance/anger and disgust/boredom, don't really seem to fit the data. I'm not sure I find the idea that rats become annoyed or disgusted during fear conditioning to be a particularly compelling argument. As such the list appears to be a collection of emotion-related words, with unclear potential associations with the 44kHz calls.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree that most of the factors listed are not supported by the data. These are hypotheses and speculations only – hence, an assumption / tentative statement, i.e., “It could also be argued that…”. We have changed it into “It could also be speculated that…”.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Later in the Discussion the authors argue that the 44kHz aversive calls signal an increased intensity of a negative valence emotional state. It is not clear how the presented arguments actually support this. For example, what does the elongation of fear conditioning to 10 trials have to do with increased negative emotionality? Is there data supporting this relationship between duration and emotion, outside anthropomorphism? Each of the 6 arguments presented seems quite distant from being able to support this conclusion.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have added a description summarizing the literature that expounds the differences in employing one-two vs. five-ten foot-shocks during fear-conditioning training. It says:</p>
<p>“Importantly, it has been demonstrated multiple times that training rats with several electric foot-shocks (i.e., 5-10 shocks) produces a qualitatively different kind of fear-memory compared to training with only 1-2 shocks. Training with more numerous shocks has been shown to result in augmented freezing (e.g., Fanselow and Bolles, 1979, Haubrich et al., 2020, Haubrich and Nader, 2023, Poulos et al., 2016, Wang et al., 2009) which reflects a more intense fear-memory that is resistant to extinction (Haubrich et al., 2020, Haubrich and Nader, 2023), resistant to reconsolidation blockade (Haubrich et al., 2020, Wang et al., 2009, Finnie and Nader, 2020), associated with downregulation of NR2B NMDA-receptor subunits as well as elevated amyloid-beta concentrations in the lateral and basal amygdala (Finnie and Nader, 2020, Wang et al., 2009). Additionally, it involves activation of the noradrenaline-locus coeruleus system (Haubrich et al., 2020) and collective changes in connectivity across multiple brain regions within the neural network (Haubrich and Nader, 2023).</p>
<p>Notably, it has also been shown that higher freezing as a result of fear-conditioning training correlates with increased concentrations of stress hormone, corticosterone, in the blood (Dos Santos Correa et al., 2019). The rats subjected to 6- and 10-trial fear conditioning, whose results are reported herein (Tab. 1/Exp. 2/#7,8,11,12; n = 73), also demonstrated higher freezing than rats subjected to 1trial conditioning (Tab. 1/Exp. 2/#6,10; n = 33), which is reported elsewhere (Olszynski et al., 2021, Fig. S1C-E; Olszynski et al., 2022, Fig. S1D-G). Therefore, we postulate that emission of 44-kHz calls is associated with increased stress and the training regime forming robust memories.”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>In sum, rather than describing the 44kHz long calls as a new call type, it may be more accurate to say that sometimes aversive calls can occur at frequencies above 22 kHz. Individual and situational variability in vocalization parameters seems to be expected, much more so than all members of a species strictly adhering to extremely non-variable behavioral outputs.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This paragraph is exactly the same as in the previous review. There was no comment regarding our previous answer. Here is the previous answer:</p>
<p>“The surprising fact that there are presumably aversive calls that are beyond the commonly applied thresholds, i.e., &gt;32 kHz, while sharing some characteristics with 22-kHz calls, is the main finding of the current publication. Whether they be finally assigned as a new type, subtype, i.e. a separate category or become a supergroup of aversive calls with 22-kHz vocalizations is of secondary importance to be discussed with other researchers of the field of study.</p>
<p>However, we would argue – by showing a comparison – that 22-kHz calls occur at durations of &lt;300 ms and also &gt;300 ms, and are, usually, referred to in literature as short and long 22-kHz vocalizations, respectively (not introduced with a description that “sometimes 22-kHz calls can occur at durations below 300 ms”). These are then regarded and investigated as separate groups or classes usually referred to as two different “types” (e.g., Barker et al., 2010) or “subtypes” (e.g., Brudzynski, 2015). Analogously, 44-kHz vocalizations can also be regarded as a separate type or a subtype of 22kHz calls. The problem with the latter is that 22-kHz vocalizations are traditionally and predominantly defined by 18–32 kHz frequency bandwidth (Araya et al., 2020; Barroso et al., 2019; Browning et al., 2011; Brudzynski et al., 1993; Hinchcliffe et al., 2022; Willey &amp; Spear, 2013).”</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>Additional considerations:</p>
<p>Abstract: The 19.4% seems to be the percentage of 44 kHz calls observed during the 9th trial of the 10trial experiment, not the percentage of calls that were 44kHz during bouts of freezing.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We clarified the sentence. It now says:</p>
<p>“We observed 44-kHz calls to be associated with freezing behavior during fear conditioning training, during which they constituted up to 19.4% of all calls and most of them appeared next to each other forming groups of vocalizations (bouts).”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Abstract: &quot;We hope that future investigations of 44-kHz calls in rat models of human diseases will  contribute to expanding our understanding and therapeutic strategies related to human psychiatric conditions.&quot; This sounds like a far too strong of an implication provided the link between these calls and models of human psychiatric conditions is not clear.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree, the link is not clear. Therefore we only express our hope. We hope “the link” is there. While other ultrasonic calls are already being investigated in such animal models, training regimes employing numerous electric shocks are used as models of PTSD, helplessness etc.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Line 101: Seems a strong assumption to state the authors of the other publication were inspired by this paper, unless there is personal communication corroborating this.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The wording of the sentence has been changed.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>It is still not clear why both Friedman and Wilcoxon tests were used, especially in situations where only one result seems to be referenced (for example on line 108-109).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We added the explanation within Methods: “In particular, the Friedman test was used to assess the presence of change within the sequence of several ITI, while the Wilcoxon test was used for the difference between the first and the last ITI analyzed.”</p>
