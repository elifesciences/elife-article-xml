<abstract>
<title>Abstract</title><p>Pyruvate occupies a central node in carbohydrate metabolism such that how it is produced and consumed can optimize a cell for energy production or biosynthetic capacity. This has been primarily studied in proliferating cells, but observations from the post-mitotic <italic>Drosophila</italic> fat body led us to hypothesize that pyruvate fate might dictate the rapid cell growth observed in this organ during development. Indeed, we demonstrate that augmented mitochondrial pyruvate import prevented cell growth in fat body cells <italic>in vivo</italic> as well as in cultured mammalian hepatocytes and human hepatocyte-derived cells <italic>in vitro</italic>. We hypothesize that this effect on cell size was caused by an increase in the NADH/NAD<sup>+</sup> ratio, which rewired metabolism toward gluconeogenesis and suppressed the biomass-supporting glycolytic pathway. Amino acid synthesis was decreased, and the resulting loss of protein synthesis prevented cell growth. Surprisingly, this all occurred in the face of activated pro-growth signaling pathways, including mTORC1, Myc, and PI3K/Akt. These observations highlight the evolutionarily conserved role of pyruvate metabolism in setting the balance between energy extraction and biomass production in specialized post-mitotic cells.</p>

<title>Summary of Updates:</title>
<fn fn-type="update"><p>We have carefully revised the manuscript in line with the reviewers' recommendations. In the revised manuscript, we have quantified trehalose abundance in circulation and within fat bodies. As described in the Methods section and following the approach outlined in Ugrankar-Banerjee et al. (2023, we bled 10 larvae (either control or MPC-expressing) using forceps onto parafilm. From this, 2 microliters of hemolymph were collected for glucose measurement. The hemolymph was treated with trehalase overnight, and the resulting glucose derived from trehalose was measured. We have observed that trehalose levels were also elevated in hemolymph of fat body-specific MPC-expressing larvae, further supporting our conclusion that MPC expression in fat body induces a hyperglycemic state. These data are now included in Figure 4h of the revised manuscript, and the details are further mentioned in the revised materials and methods.
As suggested, we have quantified the expression of Got2 manipulations mentioned in Figure 6j using RT-qPCR, this data is presented in revised Supplementary Figure 8f-h. In addition, Supplementary Figure 8i has been updated with western blot analysis of Got2 expression in knock-out cells used to perform the size analysis in HepG2 cells.
Additionally, we have also analysed the efficiency of pcb (Supplementary Figure 6a-c), pdha (Supplementary Figure 6f-h), dlat (Supplementary Figure 6f, g and i), pepck2 (Supplementary Figure 6n-p), fbp (Supplementary Figure 6n, m, q) manipulations used to modulate the expression of these genes. These validations will ensure the robustness of our findings and strengthen the conclusions of our study.

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Cells must appropriately allocate available nutrients to optimize their metabolic programsâ for energy extraction and for the generation of building blocks that enable cell growth. The balance between these processes not only maintains cellular health under varying nutritional conditions but also plays an important role in determining cell fate and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Baker &amp; Rutter, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">DeBerardinis &amp; Thompson, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Ghosh-Choudhary et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Metallo &amp; Vander Heiden, 2013</xref>). For example, hepatocyte metabolism changes considerably between fed and fasted conditions. In the fed state, hepatocytes use the majority of their nutrients to synthesize proteins, lipids, and glycogen, which results in increased cell size and liver biomass (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Kast et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Reinke &amp; Asher, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Sinturel et al., 2017</xref>). To meet the energy demands of other tissues during fasting, the liver undergoes a metabolic shift to produce glucose from biosynthetic precursors, thereby decreasing hepatocyte and liver size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Lang et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Sinturel et al., 2017</xref>).</p>
<p>The metabolic pathways that support biosynthetic metabolism can be inappropriately activated in diseases such as cancer and heart failure to promote pathological growth. For example, many of the primary oncogenic adaptations in tumors prioritize anabolic metabolism over ATP production, which facilitates rapid cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Lunt &amp; Vander Heiden, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Vander Heiden et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">Zhu &amp; Thompson, 2019</xref>). Metabolic rewiring during heart failure similarly results in greater biosynthetic potential and less efficient ATP production, which in post-mitotic cardiomyocytes leads to increased cell size and insufficient cardiac pumping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Bornstein et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Henry et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Weiss et al., 2023</xref>).</p>
<p>The fate of pyruvate, which is primarily generated from glucose via glycolysis in the cytoplasm, is a critical node that can determine the balance between energetic and biosynthetic metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Baker &amp; Rutter, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Yiew &amp; Finck, 2022</xref>). In most differentiated cells, the majority of pyruvate is transported into the mitochondria via the mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC) complex, a heterodimer composed of MPC1 and MPC2 proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Bricker et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Herzig et al., 2012</xref>). Once in the mitochondria, pyruvate is converted to acetyl-CoA by the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDH), fueling the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and supporting efficient ATP production. In cancer, stem, and other proliferative cells, more pyruvate is converted to lactate and exported from the cell, a process that regenerates NAD<sup>+</sup>, a cofactor necessary for glycolytic flux (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Baker &amp; Rutter, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Lunt &amp; Vander Heiden, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">Zhu &amp; Thompson, 2019</xref>). In some specialized cells, including hepatocytes, pyruvate is imported into mitochondria but converted to oxaloacetate, which can feed the TCA cycle but also serves as a precursor for glucose production via gluconeogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Holecek, 2023b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Jitrapakdee et al., 2008</xref>). We and others have demonstrated that these alternative fates of pyruvateâenergy generation, cell proliferation, or glucose productionâdifferentially impact the metabolic and fate decisions of multiple cell types in varying contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bensard et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Cluntun et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Wei et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Yiew &amp; Finck, 2022</xref>). Loss of MPC function, which shifts pyruvate metabolism toward lactate production and thus expedites glycolysis and the production of biosynthetic precursors, has been shown to increase cell proliferation in mouse and <italic>Drosophila</italic> intestinal stem cells as well as in various tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bensard et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Schell et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Zangari et al., 2020</xref>). MPC expression is also reduced in human and mouse models of heart failure, and genetic deletion of the MPC in cardiomyocytes is sufficient to induce hypertrophy and heart failure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Cluntun et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Fernandez-Caggiano et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">McCommis et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>). Conversely, MPC overactivation or overexpression restricts intestinal stem cell proliferation and limits the growth of cardiomyocytes under hypertrophic stimuli, with excess mitochondrial pyruvate fueling the TCA cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bensard et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Schell et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Schell et al., 2017</xref>). These observations suggest that mitochondrial pyruvate metabolism is central to cell proliferation as well as the size and specialized functions of post-mitotic cells.</p>
<p>The mechanisms regulating cell size include well-characterized cellular signaling pathways and transcriptional programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Grewal, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Liu et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Lloyd, 2013</xref>). The CDK4-Rb pathway monitors cell size in proliferating cells by coupling cell growth with cell division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Amodeo &amp; Skotheim, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Ginzberg et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Tan et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">Zhang et al., 2022</xref>). In response to insulin and other growth factors, the PI3K/Akt pathway activates mTORC1, leading to increased biosynthesis of proteins, lipids, and nucleotides, and consequently, increased cell size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Gonzalez &amp; Hall, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Gonzalez &amp; Rallis, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Saxton &amp; Sabatini, 2017</xref>). The pro-growth transcription factor Myc drives a gene expression program that enhances metabolic activity and protein synthesis, resulting in larger cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Baena et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Dang, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Iritani &amp; Eisenman, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Stine et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">van Riggelen et al., 2010</xref>). However, we only partially understand how metabolic pathways regulate physiological (or pathophysiological) growth, particularly in cells that have distinct and specialized roles in organismal metabolism.</p>
<p>Here, we investigated whether pyruvate metabolism influences biosynthetic capacity and cell size, using the <italic>Drosophila</italic> fat body as a model of the mammalian liver. We found that MPC overexpression and increased mitochondrial pyruvate transport restrict cell growth and limit protein synthesis in larval fat body cells and in spheroids of human liver-derived cells. Higher MPC expression resulted in smaller cells, not by increasing TCA cycle flux as observed in other cell types, but instead by redirecting mitochondrial pyruvate metabolism towards gluconeogenesis. A key driver of this metabolic rewiring is a reduced cellular redox state, which disrupts the biosynthesis of TCA cycle-derived amino acids, such as aspartate and glutamate, ultimately reducing protein synthesis. These observations highlight how cells with specialized functions, like hepatocytes, employ distinct metabolic adaptations to respond to organismal demands under varying nutritional conditions.</p>

<sec id="s2a">
<title>Increased mitochondrial pyruvate transport reduces the size of <italic>Drosophila</italic> fat body cells</title>
<p>The <italic>Drosophila</italic> fat body is functionally analogous to mammalian white adipose tissue and liver, serving as a buffer to store excess nutrients in fat droplets and glycogen and deploy them to support the animal with fuel during times of fasting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Arrese &amp; Soulages, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Musselman et al., 2013</xref>). During larval development, fat body cells halt cell division and dramatically increase in size during the third instar stage (from 72 to 120 hours After Egg Laying (AEL)) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Edgar &amp; Orr-Weaver, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">Zheng et al., 2016</xref>) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a-c</xref>). As a first step toward understanding the metabolic programs that enable this rapid cell growth, we performed RNA sequencing of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> fat body across this developmental period. We observed a time-dependent change in mRNAs encoding proteins that have well-characterized roles in supporting cell growth, including components of the insulin and mTORC1 signaling pathways and the Myc transcriptional network which correlated with increased cell size (Supplementary Fig. 1a). Amongst metabolic genes, we observed modest differences in those that function in amino acid synthesis and fatty acid metabolism (Supplementary Fig. 1b). The abundances of mRNAs encoding proteins involved in glycolysis, oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos), and the TCA cycle were distinctly altered in fat bodies during development (Supplementary Fig. 1b). Since pyruvate metabolism is the central node connecting carbohydrate metabolism and the TCA cycle, we studied the abundances of mRNAs that encode proteins that regulate pyruvate metabolism (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d</xref>). We found that the expression of genes that link pyruvate to the TCA cycle were reduced including, <italic>Pyk,</italic> the <italic>Drosophila</italic> pyruvate kinase homolog, which converts phosphoenolpyruvate into pyruvate; <italic>Mpc1</italic> and <italic>Mpc2,</italic> which encode the two subunits of the MPC, which transports pyruvate into the mitochondrial matrix; as well as <italic>Pdha</italic> and <italic>Dlat,</italic> which encode subunits of PDH complex (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1e</xref>). In contrast, some mRNAs encoding proteins that regulate pyruvate abundance were upregulated such as <italic>Pepck</italic> and <italic>Pepck2</italic>, which make phosphoenolpyruvate from oxaloacetate (Supplementary Fig. 1c). Based on these data, we hypothesized that the suppression of mitochondrial pyruvate metabolism, which is gated by the action of the MPC, might support the rapid cell growth observed in fat body cells.</p>

<p>To test this hypothesis, we prevented the downregulation of the MPC during larval development (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1e</xref>) by ectopically expressing <italic>Mpc1</italic> and <italic>Mpc2</italic> (termed âMPC+â Supplementary Fig. 2a, 2b). The sustained expression of the MPC (both <italic>Mpc1</italic> and <italic>Mpc2</italic>) throughout the fat body significantly reduced the rate of cell growth compared to a GFP-expressing control (Supplementary Fig. 2c). Given the important role of the fat body in controlling organismal growth, we wanted to assess the cell-autonomous effects of MPC expression using mosaic analysis in individual fat body cells (Supplementary Fig. 2d) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Ito et al., 1997</xref>). We generated GFP-labeled clones with expression of the MPC (MPC+), which we confirmed by immunofluorescence (Supplementary Fig. 2e, f). The MPC-expressing, GFP-positive cells were significantly smaller in size compared with either mock clones (control) or neighboring GFP-negative cells within the same tissue. <italic>Mpc1</italic> knock down (<italic>Mpc1</italic>-KD) clones, in contrast, were marginally larger (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1f-g</xref>). These results demonstrate that sustained expression of the MPC in developing fat body cells is sufficient to prevent cell growth in a cell-autonomous manner.</p>
<p>If the effects of MPC expression were related to the mitochondrial transport of pyruvate, then limiting the production of pyruvate should mitigate these effects. Therefore, we measured cell size in larvae raised on either a normal (9% sugar) diet or a diet with no added sugars, which limits the production of pyruvate from glucose and fructose. Limiting dietary sugars significantly reduced the size of control clones but increased the size of MPC-expressing clones. Notably, the size of MPC-expressing fat body clones was comparable to that of control clones when larvae were grown in sugar-limited medium, suggesting that limiting pyruvate synthesis abolishes the effect of MPC expression on fat body cell size (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1h, i</xref>). <italic>Mpc1</italic>-KD clones were again larger than control cells, and their size was unaffected by the sugar-limited diet. Inhibiting MPC activity by feeding larvae a normal diet supplemented with the MPC inhibitor UK5099 ameliorated the cell size effects of MPC expression (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1j</xref>; Supplementary Fig. 2g). These results indicate that pyruvate transport into mitochondria inversely correlates with the size gain in fat body cells. These observations also suggest that the suppression of mitochondrial pyruvate import and metabolism is required for the rapid cell size expansion observed in the fat body during larval development.</p>
<p>The size of a cell is determined by its content of proteins, nucleic acids, and lipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Bjorklund, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Lloyd, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Schmoller &amp; Skotheim, 2015</xref>). To understand how MPC expression affects the abundance of these macromolecules, we dissected fat bodies from control and fat body-wide MPC-expressing larvae at 120 hours AEL and quantified DNA, RNA, triacylgylcerides, and protein. Control and MPC+ fat bodies had equivalent DNA content (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1k</xref>; Supplementary Fig. 2h) and similar levels of EdU incorporation (Supplementary Fig 2o, p), suggesting that MPC expression does not impact DNA endoreplication. RNA and lipid content were modestly decreased in MPC+ fat bodies compared with control tissues (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1k</xref>; Supplementary Fig. 2i, j), although the number of lipid droplets was higher with MPC expression (Supplementary Fig 2l-n). In contrast, MPC expression dramatically decreased protein abundance in fat bodies (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1k</xref>, Supplementary Fig. 2k), and reduced protein synthesis as assessed by staining for the puromycin analog, O-propargyl-puromycin (OPP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Deliu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Villalobos-Cantor et al., 2023</xref>) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1l, m</xref>). These data suggest that MPC-mediated mitochondrial pyruvate import decreases protein synthesis, which likely contributes to the reduced size of MPC-expressing cells. Conversely, in developing fly larvae, repression of the MPC and the subsequent decrease in mitochondrial pyruvate appear to provide a metabolic mechanism to support a rapid expansion in cell size.</p>

<title>Growth factor signaling pathways are hyperactivated in MPC expressing cells</title>
<p>The best understood mechanisms that govern cell size involve conserved signaling and transcriptional networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Bjorklund, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Grewal, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Lang et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Lloyd, 2013</xref>). For example, the mTORC1 pathway coordinates both extracellular and intracellular growth regulatory signals to dictate the synthesis and degradation of macromolecules, including proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Gonzalez &amp; Hall, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Gonzalez &amp; Rallis, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Saxton &amp; Sabatini, 2017</xref>). mTORC1 increases protein synthesis through the phosphorylation of several proteins, including S6 kinase (S6K) and 4EBP1 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>). Since MPC-expressing clones were smaller in size and had reduced protein synthesis compared with control clones, we assessed mTORC1 activity in the fat body using our mosaic expression system. As a control, we confirmed that <italic>S6k</italic> (the <italic>Drosophila</italic> gene encoding S6K) over-expressing clones were larger in size and had elevated phospho-S6 staining compared with wild-type clones (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b, c</xref>). Surprisingly, MPC+ clones also had elevated phospho-S6 staining (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b, c</xref>), suggesting that despite their small size, these cells have high mTORC1 activity. Over-expression of <italic>Rheb</italic>, which is an upstream activator of mTORC1, resulted in clones that were larger than wild-type controls and which had increased phospho-4EBP1 staining (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d, e</xref>). Again, even though the MPC+ clones were smaller in size, we observed robust p-4EBP1 staining, indicating that mTORC1 is hyperactive in these cells.</p>

<p>Gene set enrichment analysis of RNA-sequencing data from MPC-expressing fat bodies showed enrichment for signatures associated with pro-growth signaling (Supplementary Fig. 3a). We assessed markers of several of these pathways in MPC+ clones. In addition to the mTORC1 pathway, Myc increases cell growth by regulating the transcription of ribosome subunits and biosynthetic metabolic genes. We found that MPC+ clones had an elevated abundance of the Myc protein, both in the cytoplasm and nucleus, (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2f, g</xref>), suggesting that the growth-promoting Myc transcriptional program is active in these cells. MPC+ clones also had reduced expression of the transcription factor Foxo, consistent with its downregulation by pro-growth signaling pathways (Supplementary Fig. 3b). Finally, we stained for phospho-eIF2Î± to assess the activity of the integrated stress response, which restricts global protein synthesis. Starvation robustly induced the integrated stress response in control clones, but MPC+ clones exhibited no evidence of activation of this pathway under normal growth conditions (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2h, i</xref>). Collectively these data indicate that conventional pro-growth pathways are activated in MPC-expressing clones, which is incongruent with the small size of the clones. This suggests that mitochondrial pyruvate metabolism controls cell size via alternative molecular mechanisms.</p>
<p>We next performed genetic epistasis analysis to better understand the relationship between MPC expression and the mTORC1, PI3K, and Myc pathways. Activation of the PI3K or mTORC1 pathways, via over-expression of <italic>PI3K</italic>, increased the size of control but not MPC-expressing fat body cells (Supplementary Fig. 3c). Similarly, activation of mTORC1 via knock down of its inhibitor, Tuberous Sclerosis Complex 1 (<italic>Tsc1</italic>), increased the size of control cells but had no effect on MPC+ cell size (Supplementary Fig. 3d). Over-expression of <italic>Myc</italic>, on the other hand, increased the size of control and MPC+ fat body clones to a similar degree (Supplementary Fig. 3e). Knock down of <italic>Myc</italic> was sufficient to decrease cell size to a similar extent as MPC expression; however, <italic>Myc</italic> knock down had no additional effect on cell size in MPC+ clones (Supplementary Fig. 3f). These results suggest that neither mTORC1, PI3K, nor Myc are epistatic to MPC and suggest that MPC likely acts independently of these canonical pathways to regulate the size of fat body cells.</p>

<title>Increased mitochondrial pyruvate transport reduces the size of HepG2 cells and spheroids</title>
<p>Since the <italic>Drosophila</italic> fat body has many features reminiscent of the mammalian liver, we tested whether MPC expression might similarly restrict cell size in cells derived from this tissue. We engineered HepG2 cells, which were originally isolated from a hepatocellular carcinoma, to express epitope tagged-MPC1 and MPC2 in a doxycycline-inducible manner. We observed expression of ectopic MPC1 and MPC2 starting at four hours after doxycycline treatment, which increased over the duration of the time course, peaking at 24 hours post-induction (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>). We stained doxycycline-treated cells with phalloidin and measured cell size using microscopy images taken at two-hour intervals. Induction of MPC expression coincided with a significant reduction in cell size, which was first apparent six hours post-doxycycline treatment and was sustained for the remainder of the time course (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref>). Doxycycline had no effect on the size of control HepG2 cells (EV). Treatment with the MPC inhibitor UK5099 for 24 hours markedly increased the size of control cells and partially reversed the small size phenotype of MPC-expressing cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3c</xref>). We also assessed cell volume by analyzing a 3D reconstruction of confocal images of phalloidin-stained HepG2 cells and found that the cell volume was lower in MPC+ cells (Supplementary Fig. 4a).</p>

<p>We have observed that the physiological consequences of altered pyruvate metabolism are more apparent in cells grown in a three-dimensional culture environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Schell et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Wei et al., 2022</xref>). Using our doxycycline-inducible cells, we found that MPC expression resulted in spheroids that were significantly smaller than control spheroids as assessed by microscopy (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3d, e</xref>). Cells from MPC-expressing spheroids were also smaller, as shown by flow cytometry (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3f, g</xref>). When compared with control (EV) spheroids, expression of MPC did not affect the number of cells per spheroid, the cell cycle phase distribution, or the number of apoptotic or necrotic cells (Supplementary Fig. 4b, 4c, and 4d). These analyses suggest that the smaller size observed in MPC expressing spheroids is not due to effects on cell proliferation or cell death.</p>
<p>Consistent with our observations in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> fat body, protein content was lower in MPC-expressing HepG2 spheroids compared with EV controls, whereas there was no difference in the abundances of DNA, RNA, or triacylglycerides (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3h</xref>; Supplementary Fig. 4e-h). To directly assess the effect of MPC expression on protein synthesis, we induced the MPC in HepG2 cells and treated the cells acutely with a low concentration of puromycin to label nascent proteins. We found that MPC expression decreased the incorporation of the amino acid analog L-homopropargylglycine (HPG) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Shen et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Tom Dieck et al., 2012</xref>) into nascent proteins, as assessed by fluorescence microscopy (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3i, j</xref>). Protein synthesis was similarly reduced in MPC-expressing HepG2 spheroids (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3k, l</xref>). These observations were further supported by the decreased abundance of the short-lived, destabilized GFP (d2GFP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Li et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Pavlova et al., 2020</xref>) in MPC-expressing HepG2 spheroids compared with controls. This reduction in the level of d2GFP was prevented by treatment with the MPC inhibitor UK5099 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3m</xref>). Together, these data suggest that increased transport of pyruvate into mitochondria, mediated by MPC expression, reduces protein synthesis and cell size in both fly and mammalian models.</p>

<title>Excess mitochondrial pyruvate promotes gluconeogenesis</title>
<p>We have previously shown that loss of the MPC reduces the contribution of glucose and pyruvate to the TCA cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bensard et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Cluntun et al., 2021</xref>). To investigate how MPC expression impacts carbohydrate metabolism in HepG2 cells, we performed metabolic tracing using <sup>13</sup>C-glucose (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref>). We observed that MPC expression reduced the labeling fraction of the glycolytic intermediates 3-phosphoglycerate (Supplementary Fig. 5a) and pyruvate (Supplementary Fig. 5b), as well as alanine (Supplementary Fig. 5c), which is derived from pyruvate, all of which suggests a reduction in glycolysis in these cells. Once imported into mitochondria, glycolytic-derived pyruvate has two major fates: conversion to acetyl-CoA by PDH or to oxaloacetate by pyruvate carboxylase (PC). These fates can be differentiated by assessing the abundances of M+2 (derived from PDH) and M+3 (derived from PC) TCA cycle intermediates (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref>). We found that both M+2 and M+3 isotopomers of TCA cycle intermediates were modestly increased following MPC expression (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4c</xref>; Supplementary Fig. 5d-i). The fact that we observe increases in TCA cycle intermediates despite decreased glycolytic labeling in pyruvate suggests that the apparent labeling through PDH and PC might be underestimating the effect on metabolic flux through these enzymes. Thus, it appears that MPC expression increases the activity of both enzymes that utilize pyruvate. Typically, when TCA cycle flux is increased, one observes an increase in activity of the electron transport chain (ETC) to oxidize the resulting NADH. However, MPC expression had no impact on ETC activity as assessed by measuring oxygen consumption (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4d</xref>). The implications of elevated NADH production without a concomitant increase in NADH oxidation will be discussed in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>.</p>

<p>To probe the impact of increased flux through the PC and PDH reactions, we conducted genetic epistatic analysis in fat body cells. We found that <italic>Drosophila</italic> fat body clones in which we over-expressed <italic>Pcb</italic> (the <italic>Drosophila</italic> gene encoding pyruvate carboxylase) were significantly smaller than controls and were equivalent in size to MPC+ clones (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4e, f</xref>; Supplementary Fig. 6a-c). Clones expressing both the MPC and <italic>Pcb</italic> were even smaller (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4e, f</xref>; Supplementary Fig. 6a-c). Conversely, knockdown of <italic>Pcb</italic> (<italic>Pcb</italic>-KD) in MPC-expressing fat body clones completely rescued the cell size phenotype (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4e, f</xref>; Supplementary Fig. 6d). Knockdown of <italic>Pcb</italic> in MPC-expressing HepG2 cells also eliminated the small cell size phenotype (Supplementary Fig. 6e). These data suggested that the small size of cells expressing the MPC is likely due to increased flux through the PC reaction. Consistent with this, knock down of the PDH-E1 (<italic>Drosophila</italic> gene <italic>Pdha</italic>) or PDH-E2 (<italic>Drosophila</italic> gene <italic>Dlat</italic>) subunits of PDH, which should divert mitochondrial pyruvate, so it is preferentially used by PC, also resulted in smaller fat body cells (Supplementary Fig. 6f-k). In contrast, activating PDH by knocking down the inhibitory PDH kinases (mammalian PDKs, <italic>Drosophila</italic> gene <italic>Pdk</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Stacpoole, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Wang et al., 2021</xref>), which should promote the flux of pyruvate through PDH and away from PC, rescued cell size in MPC-expressing fat body clones (Supplementary Fig. 6j, k). Similarly, in MPC-expressing HepG2 cells, activation of PDH via treatment with the PDK inhibitors DCA and AZD7545 was sufficient to restore cell size (Supplementary Fig. 6l), (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Stacpoole, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Wang et al., 2021</xref>). These analyses suggest that the reduction in cell size observed with MPC expression is due to PC-mediated metabolism of pyruvate.</p>
<p>The product of PC, oxaloacetate, has three major metabolic fates: 1) feeding the TCA cycle via citrate synthase as discussed above, 2) conversion to aspartate by glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase 2 (GOT2), and 3) conversion to phosphoenolpyruvate by PEPCK2, leading to gluconeogenesis, synthesis of glucose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Jitrapakdee et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Kiesel et al., 2021</xref>). Sustained expression of the MPC in fat bodies increased the concentration of glucose in this tissue (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4g</xref>) as well as glucose and trehalose in larval circulation (known as hemolymph) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4h</xref>), suggesting that MPC expression increases glucose production in fat body cells. Next, we tested whether PEPCK2-mediated gluconeogenesis was elevated in these cells compared with controls. We used <sup>13</sup>C-lactate to trace the <sup>13</sup>C-labeling of phosphoenolpyruvate and resultant glucose synthesis via gluconeogenesis (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4i</xref>). We found that the relative abundance of M+3 phosphoenolpyruvate was higher in MPC-expressing cells compared with controls (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4j</xref>), suggesting increased activity of PEPCK2. The gluconeogenic pathway employs a series of biochemical reactions to convert phosphoenolpyruvate into glucose, which is then excreted from the cell. This production of M+6 glucose from lactate was also higher in MPC-expressing HepG2 cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4k</xref>). To test whether gluconeogenesis contributes to the small size phenotype of MPC-expressing cells, we knocked down enzymes in the pathway (<italic>Drosophila</italic> phosphoenol carboxykinase, <italic>Pepck2,</italic> and fructose bisphosphatase, <italic>Fbp</italic>) and assessed cell size in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and HepG2 models. Knockout of PEPCK2 rescued the size of MPC-expressing HepG2 cells grown in spheroids (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4l</xref>) and cells (Supplementary Fig. 6m). Knockdown of either <italic>Pepck2</italic> or <italic>Fbp</italic> partially rescued the size defect in MPC-expressing <italic>Drosophila</italic> fat body clones (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4n, o</xref>; Supplementary Fig. 6n-r), and <italic>Pepck2</italic> knockdown also increased protein synthesis in these clones (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4p, q</xref>). Collectively, these data suggest that the cell size and protein synthesis phenotypes observed in MPC-expressing cells require PC-mediated gluconeogenesis, and this relationship is found in both the <italic>Drosophila</italic> fat body and in HepG2 cells.</p>

<title>A redox imbalance impairs protein synthesis and cell growth in MPC-expressing cells</title>
<p>We were intrigued by the observation that MPC expression exerted its impact on cell size through PC, rather than via increased flux through PDH. We did not observe any differences in the abundances of PDH1a, phosphorylated (Ser-293, inactive) PDH1a, PC, PEPCK2, or G6PC proteins in MPC-expressing HepG2 cells (Supplementary Fig. 7a, b). We therefore hypothesized that the shift in pyruvate metabolism in response to MPC expression might be driven by changes in the abundances of enzyme cofactors, metabolite regulators, or cellular redox balance. PC and PDH show reciprocal regulation by such factors: PC utilizes ATP as a substrate and is allosterically activated by acetyl-CoA, whereas PDH is inhibited by ATP, acetyl CoA, and NADH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Chai et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Sugden &amp; Holness, 2011</xref>) (Supplementary Fig. 7c). In addition, several reactions in gluconeogenesis require ATP or NADH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Hausler et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Siess et al., 1977</xref>) (Supplementary Fig. 7c). Upon induction of MPC expression in HepG2 cells, we observed increased abundance of acetyl-CoA (Supplementary Fig. 7d), a higher ATP to ADP ratio (Supplementary Fig. 7e), a greater abundance of NADH without an increase in NAD<sup>+</sup>, and thus an increase in the cellular NADH/NAD<sup>+</sup> ratio (Supplementary Fig. 7f-h). To determine how MPC expression impacts the subcellular distribution of redox factors, we separated cytoplasmic and mitochondrial fractions from control or MPC-expressing <italic>Drosophila</italic> fat bodies and measured the NADH/NAD<sup>+</sup> ratio. We found that MPC expression increased the NADH/NAD<sup>+</sup> ratio in both the cytoplasm and mitochondria (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5a</xref>). We observed a similar increase in the NADH/ NAD<sup>+</sup> ratio in both fractions in MPC-expressing HepG2 spheroids (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5b</xref>). It is important to note that these measurements can be confounded by the very rapid redox reactions that can happen post-harvest. Nonetheless, these combined results suggest that the increased abundances of acetyl-CoA, ATP, and NADH in MPC-expressing cells could promote the rewiring of mitochondrial pyruvate metabolism through PC and support gluconeogenesis.</p>
<p>To test the hypothesis that ATP or NADH concentrations might affect cell size in MPC-expressing <italic>Drosophila</italic> fat body clones or HepG2 cells, we utilized pharmacological or genetic modulation of these molecules. Treatment with gramicidin, which decreases the ATP to ADP ratio (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Xue et al., 2022</xref>), did not alter the size of MPC-expressing HepG2 cells (Supplementary Fig. 7i). We used several orthogonal approaches to reduce the cellular NADH/NAD<sup>+</sup> ratio in the MPC-expressing systems and measured their effect on cell size. Co-expression of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyl transferase (<italic>Nmnat)</italic>, which increases NAD<sup>+</sup> biosynthesis, almost normalized the small size phenotype of MPC-expressing clones in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> fat body (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5c, d</xref>). We observed a similar rescue of cell size following expression of the <italic>Ciona intestinalis</italic> alternate Complex I enzyme NADH dehydrogenase (NDX) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Gospodaryov et al., 2020</xref>) or the yeast NADH dehydrogenase (NDI) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Sanz et al., 2010</xref>), both of which oxidize NADH to NAD<sup>+</sup> without concomitant proton translocation and energy capture (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5e, f</xref>). Expression of NDI in HepG2 cells also mitigated the effect of MPC expression on spheroid size (Supplementary Fig. 7j, k), as did treatment with duroquinone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Merker et al., 2006</xref>) (Supplementary Fig. 7l), which oxidizes NADH to NAD<sup>+</sup>. To extend these investigations to three-dimensional culture, we supplemented the growth medium of MPC-expressing HepG2 spheroids with the NAD<sup>+</sup> precursors nicotinamide riboside (NR) or nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN), both of which recovered spheroid size (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5g, h</xref>).</p>
<p>Since MPC expression reduced protein synthesis in both <italic>Drosophila</italic> fat bodies and HepG2 cells, we tested how cellular redox status might contribute to this phenotype in both systems. Expression of NDX, which lowers the NADH/NAD<sup>+</sup> ratio, increased translation in MPC-expressing <italic>Drosophila</italic> fat body clones (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5i, j</xref>). In HepG2 spheroids, boosting NAD<sup>+</sup> biosynthesis by supplementing growth media with NR or NMN partially rescued the abundance of destabilized GFP (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5k</xref>). These results suggest that the elevated NADH/ NAD<sup>+</sup> ratio in MPC-expressing cells limits protein synthesis and that normalizing that ratio increases protein synthesis and cell size.</p>

<title>Reduced amino acid abundance impairs the size of MPC-expressing cells</title>
<p>Given the reduced protein synthesis observed upon MPC expression, we assessed amino acid concentrations in HepG2 using steady-state metabolomics. We found that MPC expression reduced the abundance of most amino acids (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6a</xref>). To test whether the low abundances of amino acids contribute to the smaller size of MPC-expressing cells, we supplemented the growth media of HepG2 spheroids with excess non-essential amino acids (NEAAs)âeither two or three times the recommended dilution of a commercially available amino acid cocktail that includes glycine, L-alanine, L-asparagine, L-aspartate, L-glutamate, L-proline, and L-serine.

<p>To determine which amino acid(s) contribute to the cell size effects of MPC expression, we cultured control and MPC-expressing HepG2 cells in media supplemented with an excess of each amino acid from the NEAA cocktail. Treatment with excess glycine, L-alanine, or L-serine had no effect on cell size (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6h</xref>). However, the size of MPC-expressing cells was normalized by supplementation with L-aspartate, L-glutamate, or L-proline (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6h</xref>), all of which are derived from TCA cycle intermediates. Supplementation with either L-aspartate or L-glutamate also rescued the small size phenotype of MPC-expressing HepG2 spheroids (Supplementary Fig. 8a, b). Increasing L-aspartate uptake by over-expressing the aspartate transporter SLC1A3 also recovered size of HepG2 spheroids (Supplementary Fig. 8c, d). In addition, treatment with excess (3x) NEAA partially restored the abundance of d2GFP in MPC-expressing HepG2 spheroids (Supplementary Fig. 8e), suggesting rescued protein synthesis.</p>
<p>Like glutamate and proline, aspartate is derived from a TCA cycle intermediate, specifically via transamination of oxaloacetate by glutamic-oxaloacetate transaminase 2 (GOT2). Since GOT2 and PEPCK2 both utilize oxaloacetate as a substrate, we hypothesized that knocking down GOT2 might phenocopy MPC expression by driving PEPCK2-mediated conversion of oxaloacetate into phosphoenolpyruvate and thereby suppressing aspartate biosynthesis. Knock down of <italic>Got2</italic> (the <italic>Drosophila</italic> gene encoding GOT2) reduced cell size in <italic>Drosophila</italic> fat body clones and phenocopied MPC-expressing cells (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6i, j</xref>; Supplementary Fig. 8f-h). Similarly, both GOT2 knock out and MPC-expressing HepG2 cells were smaller than EV (Supplementary Fig. 8i). Expression of the MPC in these GOT2 knock down systems had no significant impact on cell size (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6i, j</xref>; Supplementary Fig. 8i), suggesting that the effects of MPC expression and GOT2 knock down act similarly to limit amino acid synthesis and cell size. We next performed the reciprocal experiment by over-expressing <italic>Got2</italic> to favor the production of aspartate from oxaloacetate. <italic>Got2</italic> expression normalized cell size in both MPC-expressing fat body clones and in HepG2 spheroids (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6i, j</xref>; Supplementary Fig. 8j, k). The efflux of aspartate from mitochondria into the cytoplasm is a critical component of the malate-aspartate shuttle, which is a major redox shuttle in human cells. To test whether increasing the abundance of aspartate would ameliorate the high NADH/NAD<sup>+</sup> ratio observed in MPC-expressing cells, we supplemented growth media with exogenous aspartate and assessed cellular redox status. We found that excess aspartate reduced the cellular NADH/NAD<sup>+</sup> ratio in these cells such that it was comparable with control cells (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6k</xref>). We observed similar results when we treated these cells with NMN or UK5099 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6k</xref>). Moreover, all these treatments increased protein synthesis in MPC-expressing cells (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6l, m</xref>).</p>

<title>Mitochondrial pyruvate import reduces the size of rat primary hepatocytes</title>
<p>Although HepG2 cells exhibit some features of hepatocytes, they are a transformed, immortalized, and proliferative hepatocellular carcinoma cell line. We wanted to test whether the MPC expression phenotypes that we observed in <italic>Drosophila</italic> fat bodies and HepG2 cells could be recapitulated in a more physiologically relevant mammalian model. We chose primary rat hepatocytes, which have been used extensively to interrogate hepatocyte cell metabolism and signaling and also have the advantage of being genetically tractable. We expressed MPC1 and MPC2 in cultured primary rat hepatocytes (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7a</xref>), and, consistent with our results in other systems, we found that expression of MPC reduced cell size (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7b, c</xref>) and decreased protein synthesis (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7d</xref>). MPC-expressing primary hepatocytes also had a higher NADH to NAD<sup>+</sup> ratio in both the cytoplasmic and mitochondrial fractions (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7e</xref>). We assessed gluconeogenesis in primary hepatocytes by quantifying glucose in the culture media following incubation with the gluconeogenic precursors, pyruvate, and lactate. Glucose production was higher in MPC-expressing hepatocytes compared with controls (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7f</xref>). Treatment with UK5099 eliminated this effect and reduced glucose production to a similar rate in both cells (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7f</xref>). These results demonstrate that augmented mitochondrial pyruvate in hepatocytes, and related cells in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, drives a metabolic program that results in an increased NADH/NAD<sup>+</sup> ratio. This scenario results in accelerated gluconeogenesis, decreased protein synthesis, and reduced cell size.</p>

Under normal conditions, mitochondrial pyruvate fuels the TCA cycle, maintaining redox balance and generating sufficient amino acids for cellular homeostasis. However, when mitochondrial pyruvate transport is increased and excess pyruvate is metabolized, both mitochondrial and cytoplasmic redox states are altered. This excess pyruvate enhances the activities of pyruvate carboxylase (PC), pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH), and the TCA cycle, leading to an elevated NADH/NAD<sup>+</sup> ratio. The oxaloacetate produced by PC is converted into phosphoenolpyruvate via PEPCK2, promoting gluconeogenesis.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We investigated whether pyruvate metabolism influences biosynthetic capacity and cell size in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> fat body and in HepG2 spheroids. During the third instar phase of <italic>Drosophila</italic> larval growth, when cells are rapidly expanding in size, we observed a profoundly decreased expression of the MPC in liver-like fat body cells. We found that this rewiring of pyruvate metabolism is essential for cell growth as forced maintenance of MPC expression resulted in dramatically smaller cells. By combining <italic>Drosophila</italic> genetic analyses and metabolomics studies in HepG2 cells and spheroids, we demonstrated that excess mitochondrial pyruvate elevates the cellular NADH/NAD<sup>+</sup> ratio and redirects carbohydrate metabolism to favor gluconeogenesis over glycolysis (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7g</xref>). This shift reduces the availability of oxaloacetate for aspartate and glutamate biosynthesis, triggering a broader imbalance in amino acid abundances within the cell. We conclude that altering the fate of pyruvate to support biomass accumulation is required for the cell size expansion that occurs during fat body development. We speculate that this phenomenon also applies to the mammalian liver, which is the closest analog of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> fat body, as both HepG2 cells and primary rat hepatocytes show similar effects following ectopic MPC expression.</p>
<p>Why does simply reorienting the metabolism of pyruvate have this profound effect on cell growth? Our data suggest that a central mediator of the phenotype is an elevated NADH/NAD<sup>+</sup> ratio, which likely results from MPC expression driving an acceleration of the TCA cycle, as evidenced by an increase in the abundances of M+2 isotopomers of TCA cycle intermediates. Although the increase in labeled succinate, fumarate, and malate is modest, it occurs despite a reduction in glycolytic labeling. This suggests that less labeled pyruvate feeds the TCA in MPC-expressing cells compared with controls and that we are likely underestimating the actual increase in flux. The TCA cycle generates NADH and appears to do so more actively in cells with ectopically expressed MPC. However, our oxygen consumption data suggest that the oxidative phosphorylation system in these cells does not have the capacity to increase its activity in response to the enhanced availability of mitochondrial pyruvate and an increased NADH/NAD<sup>+</sup> ratio. As a result, the increased TCA cycle flux and limited ETC activity together elevate the NADH/NAD<sup>+</sup> ratio in both the mitochondria and cytoplasm, disrupting cellular redox balance leading to a rewiring of cellular metabolism.</p>
<p>This redox situation causes two distinct but related perturbations that appear to both contribute to decreased cell growth. First, we observed a clear depletion of amino acids and evidence of decreased synthesis of amino acids that are primarily derived from TCA cycle intermediates (aspartate, glutamate, and proline). A reduced NAD<sup>+</sup> pool impairs the capacity of cells to synthesize aspartate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Birsoy et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Sullivan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Sullivan et al., 2018</xref>), which is used to synthesize glutamate and proline and which plays a crucial role in maintaining redox balance in both the mitochondria and cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Alkan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Holecek, 2023a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Lieu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Wei et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Yoo et al., 2020</xref>). Replenishing any of these TCA cycle-derived amino acids via genetic or nutritional increases in their availability was sufficient to reverse the effect of ectopic MPC expression on cell size. Thus, amino acid depletion is a key driver of the small size phenotype. Second, the increased NADH/NAD<sup>+</sup> ratio also drives a particular metabolic program that favors the conversion of mitochondrial pyruvate to oxaloacetate and a subsequent increase in gluconeogenesis. This program is enforced by allosteric regulation via NADH, acetyl-CoA, and ATP, which act on PC and several enzymes of glycolysis and gluconeogenesis. It also appears to be important for the small size of MPC-expressing cells since loss of any of several steps along the gluconeogenic pathway, particularly PC and PEPCK2, mitigates or eliminates the cell size phenotype observed with ectopic MPC expression in fat body cells and HepG2 spheroids. It is important to note that gluconeogenesis is a critical function of these cells, and its rate is carefully controlled in response to varying physiological stimuli. Surprisingly, constitutive MPC expression is sufficient to supersede the control enacted by physiological and hormonal signals and enact the loss of biomass and impaired cell size.</p>
<p>We have previously shown that loss of the MPC enhanced the stem cell identity and proliferation of intestinal stem cells, whereas ectopic MPC expression had the opposite effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bensard et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Schell et al., 2017</xref>). Such observations are consistent with our findings that MPC expression inversely correlates with biomass accumulation. More recent data demonstrated that enhanced MPC activity prevented the increase in cell size that occurs in cardiomyocytes in response to hypertrophic signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Cluntun et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Fernandez-Caggiano et al., 2020</xref>). In these cases, the fate of mitochondrial pyruvate that determines cell growth is its oxidation in the TCA cycle. In contrast, our studies of hepatocytes and related cells described herein, demonstrate that the fate of pyruvate that suppresses growth in cell size is not oxidation by the TCA cycle, but rather the production of glucose, which starts with its conversion to oxaloacetate by PC in the mitochondria. Cardiomyocytes have low expression of PC compared with liver, where this enzyme (as well as others including PEPCK2) serves a vital role during fasting by producing glucose, which fuels the brain and other organs that require glucose for their survival and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Hatting et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Petersen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Rui, 2014</xref>). This is an example of how the unique metabolic physiology of specialized cells plays a critical role in maintaining organismal homeostasis.</p>
<p>One conclusion from the data presented herein is that a cellâs metabolic program plays a decisive role in determining the growth of that cell. It was striking how rapidly expression of the MPC impacted cell size in the HepG2 model. Essentially, as soon as MPC over-expression became detectable, the population of cells started to show a decrease in size. Notably, the decrease in cell size following ectopic MPC expression occurred despite the upregulation of multiple pro-growth signaling networks. It is unclear why these networks are hyperactivated in this context as there is no evidence from our data indicating any nutrients are in excess abundance. We hypothesize that there may be regulators of cell size that recognize when cells are inappropriately small and engage these pathways to increase cell size. mTORC1, PI3K, and Myc pathways typically promote biomass accumulation and increased cell size but fail to do so when mitochondrial pyruvate is elevated. MPC expression reduced the abundance of amino acids, and this appears to play a dominant role to impair protein synthesis and prevent the cell growth effects expected following hyperactivation of the mTORC1 and Myc pathways. Thus, our data suggest that the metabolic fate of pyruvate can override canonical pathways that mediate cell sizeâsuch as mTORC1 signaling.</p>
<p>We demonstrate that the appropriate partitioning of pyruvate metabolism maintains the redox state of a cell to support the accumulation of biomass that is necessary for its specialized function. Increased mitochondrial pyruvate metabolism in cells from the fly âliver-likeâ fat body disrupts these processes, causes cells to perform excess gluconeogenesis, and prevents cell growth. As a result, the <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae became hyperglycemic and experience developmental delay. The abundances of MPC1 and MPC2 are upregulated in mouse livers during starvation and in high-fat diet conditions, which correlates with increased rates of gluconeogenesis in both circumstances. Conversely, loss of the MPC in the liver impairs gluconeogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Gray et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">McCommis et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Yiew &amp; Finck, 2022</xref>). Moreover, liver dysfunction in diabetes and hepatic steatosis are driven by reductive stress and an elevated NADH/NAD<sup>+</sup> ratio (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Goodman et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Jokinen &amp; Luukkonen, 2024</xref>). We are intrigued by the possibility that the fate of pyruvate might have profound consequences on the redox state and gluconeogenic capacity of the mammalian liver, including by functioning as part of the metabolic milieu that drives unrestrained gluconeogenesis in diabetes. Our discovery that mitochondrial pyruvate regulates the cellular redox state, thereby controlling biosynthesis, offers insights for developing therapeutic strategies for these and other diseases.</p>

<p>This <bold>fundamental</bold> work demonstrates that compartmentalized cellular metabolism is a dominant input into cell size control in a variety of mammalian cell types and in Drosophila. The authors show that increased pyruvate import into the mitochondria in liver-like cells and in primary hepatocytes drives gluconeogenesis but reduces cellular amino acid production, suppressing protein synthesis. The evidence supporting the conclusions is <bold>compelling</bold>, with a variety of genetic and pharmacologic assays rigorously testing each step of the proposed mechanism. This work will be of interest to cell biologists, physiologists, and researchers interested in cell metabolism, and is significant because stem cells and many cancers exhibit metabolic rewiring of pyruvate metabolism.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The study examines how pyruvate, a key product of glycolysis that influences TCA metabolism and gluconeogenesis, impacts cellular metabolism and cell size. It primarily utilizes the Drosophila liver-like fat body, which is composed of large post-mitotic cells that are metabolically very active. The study focuses on the key observations that over-expression of the pyruvate importer MPC complex (which imports pyruvate from the cytoplasm into mitochondria) can reduce cell size in a cell-autonomous manner. They find this is by metabolic rewiring that shunts pyruvate away from TCA metabolism and into gluconeogenesis. Surprisingly, mTORC and Myc pathways are also hyper-active in this background, despite the decreased cell size, suggesting a non-canonical cell size regulation signaling pathway. They also show a similar cell size reduction in HepG2 organoids. Metabolic analysis reveals that enhanced gluconeogenesis suppresses protein synthesis. Their working model is that elevated pyruvate mitochondrial import drives oxaloacetate production and fuels gluconeogenesis during late larval development, thus reducing amino acid production and thus reducing protein synthesis.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The study is significant because stem cells and many cancers exhibit metabolic rewiring of pyruvate metabolism. It provides new insights into how the fate of pyruvate can be tuned to influence Drosophila biomass accrual, and how pyruvate pools can influence the balance between carbohydrate and protein biosynthesis. Strengths include its rigorous dissection of metabolic rewiring and use of Drosophila and mammalian cell systems to dissect carbohydrate:protein crosstalk.</p>
<p>Comments on revised version:</p>
<p>The study remains an important dissection of how metabolic compartmentalization can influence cell size. It nicely uses Drosophila and a variety of metabolic approaches. The various pathway analyses and rigorous quantitation are strengths.</p>

<p>In this manuscript, the authors leverage multiple cellular models including the drosophila fat body and cultured hepatocytes to investigate the metabolic programs governing cell size. By profiling gene programs in the larval fat body during the third instar stage - in which cells cease proliferation and initiate a period of cell growth - the authors uncover a coordinated downregulation of genes involved in mitochondrial pyruvate import and metabolism. Enforced expression of the mitochondrial pyruvate carrier restrains cell size, despite active signaling of mTORC1 and other pathways viewed as traditional determinants of cell size. Mechanistically, the authors find that mitochondrial pyruvate import restrains cell size by fueling gluconeogenesis through the combined action of pyruvate carboxylase and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase. Pyruvate conversion to oxaloacetate and use as a gluconeogenic substrate restrains cell growth by siphoning oxaloacetate away from aspartate and other amino acid biosynthesis, revealing a tradeoff between gluconeogenesis and provision of amino acids required to sustain protein biosynthesis. Overall, this manuscript is extremely rigorous, with each point interrogated through a variety of genetic and pharmacologic assays. The major conceptual advance is uncovering the regulation of cell size as a consequence of compartmentalized metabolism, which is dominant even over traditional signaling inputs. The work has implications for understanding cell size control in cell types that engage in gluconeogenesis but more broadly raise the possibility that metabolic tradeoffs determine cell size control in a variety of contexts.</p>
<p>Comments on revised version:</p>
<p>I have had a chance to review the manuscript and response to reviewer comments. I was extremely positive about this manuscript at first submission, and thought that the manuscript rigorously reported a surprising observation with broad implications across fields. The notion that intracellular metabolic networks can be dominant determinants of cell size, even over traditional signaling inputs, is surprising and important. The authors also provide convincing mechanistic insights into how the observed metabolic changes could affect cell size regulation. I think my previous comments and summary remain applicable for the revised manuscript.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this article, Toshniwal et al. investigate the role of pyruvate metabolism in controlling cell growth. They find that elevated expression of the mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC) leads to decreased cell size in the Drosophila fat body, a transformed human hepatocyte cell line (HepG2), and primary rat hepatocytes. Using genetic approaches and metabolic assays, the authors find that elevated pyruvate import into cells with forced expression of MPC increases the cellular NADH/NAD+ ratio, which drives the production of oxaloacetate via pyruvate carboxylase. Genetic, pharmacological, and metabolic approaches suggest that oxaloacetate is used to support gluconeogenesis rather than amino acid synthesis in cells over-expressing MPC. The reduction in cellular amino acids impairs protein synthesis, leading to impaired cell growth.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This study shows that the metabolic program of a cell, and especially its NADH/NAD+ ratio, can play a dominant role in regulating cell growth.</p>
<p>The combination of complementary approaches, ranging from Drosophila genetics to metabolic flux measurements in mammalian cells, strengthens the findings of the paper and shows a conservation of MPC effects across evolution.</p>

<p>The following is the authorsâ response to the original reviews.</p>

Strengths include its rigorous dissection of metabolic rewiring and use of Drosophila and mammalian cell systems to dissect carbohydrate:protein crosstalk.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>However, questions on how these two pathways crosstalk, and how this interfaces with canonical Myc and mTORC machinery remain. There are also questions related to how this protein:carbohydrate crosstalk interfaces with lipid biosynthesis. Addressing these will increase the overall impact of the study.</p>

<p>We thank the reviewer for recognizing the significance of our work and for providing constructive feedback. Our findings indicate that elevated pyruvate transport into mitochondria acts independently of canonical pathways, such as mTORC1 or Myc signaling, to regulate cell size. To investigate these pathways, we utilized immunofluorescence with well-validated surrogate measures (p-S6 and p-4EBP1) in clonal analyses of MPC expression, as well as RNAseq analyses in whole fat body tissues expressing MPC. These methods revealed surprising hyperactivation of mTORC1 and Myc signaling in Drosophila fat body cells expressing MPC, which are dramatically smaller than control cells. One explanation of these seemingly contradictory observations could be an excess of nutrients that activate mTORC1 or Myc pathways. However, our data is inconsistent with a nutrient surplus that could explain this hyperactivation. Instead, we observed reduced amino acid abundance upon MPC expression, which is very surprising given the observed hyperactivation of mTORC1. This led us to hypothesize the existence of a feedback mechanism that senses an inappropriate reduction in cell size and activates signaling pathways to promote cell growth. The best-characterized âsizerâ pathway for mammalian cells is the Cyclin D/CDK4 complex, which has been well studied in the context of cell size regulation of the cell cycle (PMID 10970848, 34022133). However, the mechanisms that sense cell size in post-mitotic cells, such as fat body cells and hepatocytes, remain poorly understood. Investigating the hypothesized size-sensing mechanisms at play here is a fascinating direction for future research.</p>
<p>For the current study, we conducted epistatic analyses with mTORC1 pathway members by overexpressing PI3K and knocking down the TORC1 inhibitor Tuberous Sclerosis Complex 1 (Tsc1). These manipulations increased the size of control fat body cells but not those overexpressing the MPC (Supplementary Fig. 3c, 3d). Regarding Myc, its overexpression increased the size of both control and MPC+ clones (Supplementary Fig. 3e), but Myc knockdown had no additional effect on cell size in MPC+ clones (Supplementary Fig. 3f). These results suggest that neither mTORC1, PI3K, nor Myc is epistatic to the cell size effects of MPC expression. Consequently, we shifted our focus to metabolic mechanisms regulating biomass production and cell size.</p>
<p>When analyzing cellular biomolecules contributing to biomass, we observed a significant impact on protein levels in Drosophila fat body cells and mammalian MPC-expressing HepG2 spheroids. Triglyceride abundance in MPC-expressing HepG2 spheroids and whole fat body cells showed a statistically insignificant decrease compared to controls. Furthermore, lipid droplets in fat body cells were comparable in MPC-expressing clones when normalized to cell size.</p>
<p>Interestingly, RNA-seq analysis revealed modestly increased expression of fatty acid and cholesterol biosynthesis pathways in MPC-expressing fat body cells. Upregulated genes included major SREBP targets, such as ATPCL (2.08-fold), FASN1 (1.15-fold), FASN2 (1.07-fold), and ACC (1.26-fold). Since mTORC1 promotes SREBP activation and MPC-expressing cells showed elevated mTOR activity and upregulation of SREBP targets, we hypothesize that SREBP is modestly activated in these cells. Nonetheless, our data on amino acid abundance and its impact on protein synthesis activity suggest that protein abundance is likely to play a prominent causal role in regulating cell size in response to increased pyruvate transport into mitochondria.</p>

<p>We thank the reviewer for their thoughtful recognition of our efforts, and we are honored by the enthusiasm the reviewer expressed for the findings and the significance of our research. We share the reviewerâs opinion that our work might help to unravel metabolic mechanisms that regulate biomass gain independent of the well-known signaling pathways.</p>

<p>Thank you for reviewing our manuscript and offering constructive feedback. We appreciate your recognition of the significance of our work and your acknowledgment of the compelling evidence we have presented. We have carefully revised the manuscript in line with the reviewers' recommendations.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The authors comment that MPC overrides hormonal controls on gluconeogenesis and cell size (Discussion, paragraph 3). Such a claim cannot be made for mammalian experiments that are conducted with immortalized cell lines or primary hepatocytes.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the reviewerâs insightful comment. Pyruvate is a primary substrate for gluconeogenesis, and our findings suggest that increased pyruvate transport into mitochondria increases the NADH-to-NAD+ ratio, and thereby elevates gluconeogenesis. Notably, we did not observe any changes in the expression of key glucagon targets, such as PC, PEPCK2, and G6PC, suggesting that the glucagon response is not activated upon MPC expression. By the statement referenced by the reviewer, we intended to highlight that excess pyruvate import into mitochondria drives gluconeogenesis independently of hormonal and physiological regulation.</p>
<p>It seems the reviewer might also have been expressing the sentiment that our in vitro models may not fully reflect the in vivo situation, and we completely agree.  Moving forward, we plan to perform similar analyses in mammalian models to test the in vivo relevance of this mechanism. For now, we will refine the language in the manuscript to clarify this point.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Nuclear size looks to be decreased in fat body cells with elevated MPC levels, consistent with reduced endoreplication, a process that drives growth in these cells. However, acute, ex vivo EdU labeling and measures of tissue DNA content are equivalent in wild-type and MPC+ fat body cells. This is surprising - how do the authors interpret these apparently contradictory phenotypes?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for raising this important issue. The size of the nucleus is regulated by DNA content and various factors, including the physical properties of DNA, chromatin condensation, the nuclear lamina, and other structural components (PMID 32997613). Additionally, cytoplasmic and cellular volume also impact nuclear size, as extensively documented during development (PMID 17998401, PMID 32473090).</p>
<p>In MPC-expressing cells, it is plausible that the reduced cellular volume impacts chromatin condensation or the nuclear lamina in a way that slightly decreases nuclear size without altering DNA content. Specifically, in our whole-fat body experiments using CG-Gal4 (as shown in Supplementary Figure 2a-c), we noted that after 12 hours of MPC expression, cell size was significantly reduced (Supplementary Figure 2c and Author Response Figure 1A). However, the reduction in nuclear size is modestly different at 24 hours and significantly different at 36 hours (Author Response Figure 1B), suggesting that the reduction in cell size is a more acute response to MPC expression, followed only later by effects on nuclear size.</p>
<p>In clonal analyses, this relationship was further clarified. MPC-expressing cells with a size greater than 1000 ÂµmÂ² displayed nuclear sizes comparable to control cells, whereas those with a drastic reduction in cell size (less than 1000 ÂµmÂ²) exhibited smaller nuclei (Author Response Figure 1C and 1D). These observations collectively suggest that changes in nuclear size are more likely to be downstream rather than upstream of cell size reduction. Given that DNA content remains unaffected, we focused on investigating the rate of protein synthesis. Our findings suggest that protein synthesis might play a causal role in regulating cell size, thereby reinforcing the connection between cellular and nuclear size in this context.</p>

<p>This figure highlights the relationship between nuclear and cell size in MPC-expressing fat body cells, emphasizing the distinct cellular responses observed following MPC induction.</p>

<p>In Figure 4d, oxygen consumption rates are measured in control cells and those overexpressing MPC. Values are normalized to protein levels, but protein is reduced in MPC+ cells. Is oxygen consumption changed by MPC expression on a per-cell basis?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As described in the manuscript, MPC-expressing cells are smaller in size. In this context, we felt that it was most appropriate to normalize oxygen consumption rates (OCR) to cellular mass to enable an accurate interpretation of metabolic activity. Therefore, we normalized OCR with protein content to account for variations in cellular size and (probably) mitochondrial mass.</p>

<p>Trehalose is the main circulating sugar in Drosophila and should be measured in addition to hemolymph glucose. Additionally, the units in Figure 4h should be related to hemolymph volume - it is not clear that they are.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate this valuable suggestion. In the revised manuscript, we have quantified trehalose abundance in circulation and within fat bodies. As described in the Methods section and following the approach outlined in Ugrankar-Banerjee et al. (2023, we bled 10 larvae (either control or MPC-expressing) using forceps onto parafilm. From this, 2 microliters of hemolymph were collected for glucose measurement. The hemolymph was treated with trehalase overnight, and the resulting glucose derived from trehalose was measured. We have observed that trehalose levels were also elevated in hemolymph of fat body-specific MPC-expressing larvae, further supporting our conclusion that MPC expression in fat body induces a hyperglycemic state. These data are now included in Figure 4h of the revised manuscript, and the details are further mentioned in the revised materials and methods.</p>

<p>Measurements of NADH/NAD ratios in conditions where these are manipulated genetically and pharmacologically (Figure 5) would strengthen the findings of the paper. Along the same lines, expression of manipulated genes - whether by RT-qPCR or Western blotting - would be helpful to assess the degree of knockdown/knockout in a cell population (for example, Got2 manipulations in Figures 6 and S8).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate this suggestion, which will provide additional rigor to our study. We have already quantified NADH/NAD+ ratios in HepG2 cells under UK5099, NMN, and Asp supplementation, as presented in Figure 6k. As suggested, we have quantified the expression of Got2 manipulations mentioned in Figure 6j using RT-qPCR, this data is presented in revised Supplementary Figure 8f-h. In addition, Supplementary Figure 8i has been updated with western blot analysis of Got2 expression in knock-out cells used to perform the size analysis in HepG2 cells.</p>
<p>Additionally, we have also analysed the efficiency of pcb (Supplementary Figure 6a-c), pdha (Supplementary Figure 6f-h), dlat (Supplementary Figure 6f, g and i), pepck2 (Supplementary Figure 6n-p), fbp  (Supplementary Figure 6n, m, q)  manipulations used to modulate the expression of these genes. These validations will ensure the robustness of our findings and strengthen the conclusions of our study.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p>
<p>General questions:</p>
<p>(1) MPC over-expression in HepG2 cells altered the redox balance and the NADH/NAD+ ratio. This is suggested to help drive the metabolic rewiring from protein to carbohydrate biosynthesis. In line with this overexpression of Nmnat (which makes NAD+) or NDX rescues cell size and elevates protein biosynthesis. However, mechanistically it is unclear exactly how these redox NAD+ changes directly impact protein biosynthesis. Some additional explanations will strengthen this portion of the study.</p>

<p>Our data indicate that the altered redox state of the cell, particularly elevated NADH levels, affects the rate of protein synthesis. A similar relationship between redox balance and protein synthesis has been observed during embryonic development (PMID: 39879975), although the underlying mechanism remains uncharacterized. Our study suggests that increased NADH levels reprogram cellular carbohydrate metabolism, shifting it from glycolysis toward gluconeogenesis. This metabolic shift necessitates the use of oxaloacetate by PEPCK2, instead of its diversion toward GTP-mediated aspartate synthesis. Aspartate, which can be anaplerotically converted into glutamate and proline, plays a critical role in protein biosynthesis. Thus, the conversion of oxaloacetate to phosphoenolpyruvate represents a key metabolic node influencing protein synthesis under altered redox conditions. Additionally, since aspartate serves as a precursor for NAD biosynthesis, this may suggest a feedforward loop reinforcing the metabolic rewiring. Nonetheless, the precise relationship between NADH concentration and redox status and the regulation of protein synthesis warrants further investigation in future studies.</p>

<p>(2) In the MPC1/2 (MPC+) over-expression background, can blocking of gluconeogenesis downstream in the carbohydrate synthesis pathway rescue the phenotype?</p>

<p>We knocked down FBPase (Drosophila fbp) using an RNAi construct, achieving approximately 60% reduction in FBPase expression in Drosophila. Notably, FBPase knockdown in fat body cells overexpressing MPC rescued the reduced cell size phenotype. These findings are presented in Figure 4o and Supplementary Figures 6nâq.</p>

<p>(3) Biomass accrual and cell size are also influenced by lipogenesis. The study suggests mTORC and Myc are uncoupled to cell size determination per se, but how lipogenesis regulatory pathways like SREBP are impacted by MPC overexpression is not really explored. How lipid membrane synthesis inter-relates to this protein/carbohydrate crosstalk would add to the understanding of the system.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As mentioned above - When analyzing cellular biomolecules contributing to biomass, we observed a significant impact on protein levels in Drosophila fat body cells and mammalian MPC-expressing HepG2 spheroids. Triglyceride abundance in MPC-expressing HepG2 spheroids and whole fat body cells showed a statistically insignificant decrease compared to controls. Furthermore, lipid droplets in fat body cells were comparable in MPC-expressing clones when normalized to cell size.</p>
<p>Interestingly, RNA-seq analysis revealed increased expression of fatty acid and cholesterol biosynthesis pathways in MPC-expressing fat body cells. Upregulated genes included major SREBP targets, such as ATPCL (2.08-fold), FASN1 (1.15-fold), FASN2 (1.07-fold), and ACC (1.26-fold). Since mTOR promotes SREBP activation and MPC-expressing cells showed elevated mTOR activity and upregulation of SREBP targets, we hypothesize that SREBP is modestly activated in these cells. Nonetheless, our data on amino acid abundance and its impact on protein synthesis activity suggest that protein abundance, rather than lipids, is likely to play a larger causal role in regulating cell size in response to increased pyruvate transport into mitochondria.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p>
<p>I have only minor suggestions for the authors to consider.</p>
<p>Minor points</p>
<p>(1) Wherever possible, scale bars should be labeled with units or indicated comparisons (e.x. Supplementary Fig. 1). To make the data as accessible as possible, it would be helpful for the authors to include the data presented in Supplementary Figure 1 as an associated table as well.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have corrected this in the revised manuscript and included the table.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) To support the conclusions about TCA cycle flux (lines 280-284), it will be helpful for the authors to consider relative metabolite pool sizes (which they should have on hand) in addition to labeling rate and fraction.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. We have included the metabolite counts with fractional abundance changes side by side in Supplementary Figure 5.</p>

<p>(3) believe (?) there is a typo in lines 326-328; PEPCK KO increases (not decreases) the size of spheroids/cells.</p>

<p>(4) Supplementary Figure 7b: PHD has 3 phospho sites that have independent regulation; the specific phosphosite queried should be listed on the figure and unless all 3 sites are probed the claims about lack of change in phosphorylation (line 337) should be removed.</p>

<p>(5) (Optional) I appreciate the effort the authors undertook to acquire cytoplasmic and mitochondrial ratios of NADH/NAD. While I recognize that many labs perform this assay, it is difficult for this reviewer to envision how accurately these values reflects the ratios present in the intact cell given how quickly these redox couples interconvert and significant post-harvest metabolic flux (see for ex PMID: 31767181), even with the extremely rapid fractionation protocol described in the methods. The present data certainly support the notion that MPC+ cells are more reduced, but these ratios may reflect a capacity for reductive metabolism rather than a bona fide NADH/NAD ratio; for example, Figure 7f shows almost identical NADH/NAD ratios in the cytoplasm and mitochondria, even though these compartments are frequently considered to have (sometimes vastly) different redox states. If the authors are willing, I would support them by including a brief discussion of the caveat of this method for new readers in the field.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with this important note from the reviewers. This is an important caveat of the technique that we used for these analyses. We have included a description of this caveat in the manuscript (Revised Manuscripts lines 393 to 395).</p>
