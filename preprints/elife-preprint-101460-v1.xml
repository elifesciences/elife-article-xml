<title>Abstract</title><p>Temperature is a critical factor influencing the outbreak and progression of viral diseases in organisms. Febrile temperatures have been shown to enhance immune competence and reduce viral replication in various species. However, the underlying mechanisms remain largely unknown. In this study, we investigate the molecular mechanisms by which elevated temperatures confer resistance to viral infections, focusing on the role of heat shock factor 1 (HSF1) in regulating antimicrobial effectors rather than the traditional target genes molecular chaperones. Using shrimp <italic>Litopenaeus vannamei</italic> as a model, we demonstrate that febrile temperatures induce HSF1, which in turn upregulates antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) that target viral envelope proteins and inhibit viral replication. Importantly, this is the first to show that HSF1 directly binds to the heat shock elements (HSE) motifs of AMPs both in shrimp and <italic>Drosophila</italic>, suggesting this may be a conserved regulatory mechanism in arthropods. Additionally, our findings highlight the role of HSF1 beyond the classical heat shock response, revealing its critical function in modulating innate immunity. These insights provide new avenues for managing viral infections in aquaculture and other settings by leveraging environmental temperature control.</p>

<label>1.</label><title>Introduction</title>
<p>The proliferation of pathogens and the outbreak of diseases are influenced by various factors, including transmission vectors, host species, and environmental conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Marcogliese, 2008</xref>). Among these, temperature is one of the most critical environmental factors, significantly impacting disease occurrence and prevalence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Hou et al., 2023</xref>). Temperature can directly affect the immune response, metabolism, feeding rate, oxygen consumption, growth, and survival of animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Deldicq et al., 2021</xref>). Aquatic animals such as fish, shrimp, crabs, and shellfish are ectothermic, and their susceptibility to diseases is directly related to temperature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Marcogliese, 2008</xref>). In fishes, Koi herpesvirus (KHV) can cause massive mortality in carp and koi carp at temperatures between 23-28 °C, while temperatures above 30 °C typically do not result in mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Yuasa et al., 2008</xref>). In crustaceans, high temperatures (32-33 ℃) have been demonstrated to inhibit white spot syndrome virus (WSSV) replication and reduce mortality in infected shrimp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Du et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Guan et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Jiravanichpaisal et al., 2004</xref>). Notably, many ectothermic animals can respond to exogenous pathogenic infections by seeking warmer external environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Covert and Reynolds, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Louis et al., 1986</xref>). When infected, some ectothermic animals such as fish, insects, and crustaceans elevate their body temperature by moving to warmer areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Bundey et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Rakhshaninejad et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Rakus et al., 2017</xref>). This behavioral fever, similar to fever responses in higher organisms, can help hosts suppress or overcome infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Hasday et al., 2014</xref>), although the mechanisms underlying this heat-induced antimicrobial immunity remain unclear.</p>
<p>The heat shock response (HSR), also known as the heat stress response, serves as a bridge linking elevated temperatures with increased immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Evans et al., 2015</xref>). The HSR induced by temperature increase primarily involves the expression of heat shock proteins (HSPs) and other related factors regulated by heat shock transcription factors (HSFs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Barna et al., 2018</xref>). Under non-stress conditions, HSF monomers are retained in the cytoplasm in a complex with HSP90 or the cytosolic chaperonin TCP1 ring complex (TRiC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Neef et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Zou et al., 1998</xref>). During the stress response, HSF dissociates from the complex, trimerizes, and converts into a DNA-binding conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Zheng et al., 2016</xref>). Activated HSF induces gene transcription through regulatory upstream promoter elements known as heat shock elements (HSEs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Hahn et al., 2004</xref>). In the face of thermal or pathogenic stress, the heat shock response functions as a highly conserved cellular mechanism across various organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Anckar and Sistonen, 2011</xref>). Research suggests that the HSF-mediated heat shock response plays a crucial role in the regulation of the innate immune network through a combination of direct gene regulation, interaction with immune signaling pathways, and the broader cellular stress response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Morimoto, 2011</xref>). In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, HSF-deficient flies, lacking a heat shock response, exhibit high sensitivity to viral infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Merkling et al., 2015</xref>), indicating that the heat shock response is a crucial component of innate antiviral immunity.</p>
<p>Heat shock factors (HSFs) are primarily recognized as inducible transcriptional regulators of genes encoding molecular chaperones and other stress proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Akerfelt et al., 2010</xref>). Interestingly, members of the HSF family also participate in various cellular processes, including apoptosis, the unfolded protein response (UPR), oxidative stress, multidrug resistance, and pathogenic infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Anckar and Sistonen, 2011</xref>). Consequently, the repertoire of HSF targets has expanded well beyond traditional heat shock genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Barna et al., 2018</xref>). Recent research has illuminated the interplay between the heat shock response (HSR) and the innate immune system, revealing that HSFs can regulate innate immune responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Akerfelt et al., 2007</xref>). For instance, HSF1, the primary HSF, can modulate the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6, thereby influencing the inflammatory response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Barna et al., 2018</xref>). Additionally, HSF1 has been shown to interact with and influence the activity of the NF-κB and MAPK pathways, thus altering the cellular environment to modulate the innate immune response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Chen et al., 2010</xref>). These unexpected observations indicate complexity of HSF function. At present, however, the mechanisms by which the HSF family affects innate immunity are still poorly understood.</p>
<p>To explore the underlying mechanisms of the febrile temperature-inducible HSF in host antiviral immunity, the shrimp <italic>Litopenaeus vannamei</italic> was challenged with WSSV, and the thermal regulation of host immunity was characterized. The results indicated that febrile temperature-inducible HSF1 confers virus resistance by regulating the expression of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) in <italic>L. vannamei</italic>. Additionally, it was revealed that high temperature (30 ℃) restricts the replication of <italic>Drosophila</italic> C virus (DCV) in an invertebrate model system (<italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 cells) also mediated by the HSF1-AMPs axis. Together, these results suggest that heat shock factor regulation of AMPs expression is a conserved defense mechanism induced by febrile temperature in arthropods.</p>

<label>2.1</label><title>Induction of Heat Shock Factor 1 in Response to WSSV at High Temperature (32 °C)</title>
<p>Studies have demonstrated that high temperatures (above 30 °C) markedly reduce mortality in shrimp infected with WSSV, while temperatures ranging from 22 to 30 °C favor higher levels of WSSV replication and associated mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Lin et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Rahman et al., 2007</xref>). To uncover the molecular mechanisms by which high temperature restricts WSSV infection, RNA-seq was performed to identify genes responsive to high temperature, particularly those encoding potential transcriptional regulators. Two shrimp groups, Group TW and Group W, were cultured at 25 °C. Group W comprised shrimp injected with WSSV and maintained at 25 °C continuously. In contrast, Group TW was subjected to a temperature increase to 32 °C at 24 hours post-injection (hpi). Gill samples were collected for analysis 12 hours post-temperature rise (hptr) and subjected to Illumina sequencing (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). As shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1C</xref>, 10 of the 1285 high temperature-induced genes were predicted to encode transcription factors.</p>

<p>Special attention has been paid to heat shock factor 1 (HSF1), the master regulator of the heat shock response, which upon activation induces not only classical heat shock genes but also a broad array of genes beyond the scope of molecular chaperones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Barna et al., 2018</xref>). To validate the high-throughput sequencing results, the expression profile of these transcription factors was confirmed by qPCR, showing a significant increase in LvHSF1 expression (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>). These results suggest that LvHSF1 may play a key role in enhancing shrimp resistance to WSSV at elevated temperatures (32 °C).</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<label>2.2</label><title>Expression Profiles of LvHSF1 in Shrimp Under Varied Temperature Conditions and WSSV Challenge</title>
<p>To determine that LvHSF1 is related to high temperature and WSSV infection, its expression level was measured under high temperature and after WSSV infection. Tissue distribution analysis showed that LvHSF1 was expressed in all examined tissues at room temperature (25 °C) and increased rapidly in all tested tissues at high temperature (32 °C; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). Additionally, the protein expression of LvHSF1 was significantly up-regulated in hemocytes, gills, and intestines when exposed to 32 °C (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>). Further investigation revealed LvHSF1’s role in the immune response to Poly (I:C) and WSSV at 25 °C. Following exposure to Poly (I:C), LvHSF1 expression was upregulated at 12 h (2.43-fold), 24 h (2.60-fold), and 36 h (4.33-fold) in hemocytes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>); slightly upregulated at 4 h (1.97-fold) and downregulated at 12 h (0.64-fold) in gills (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>); and slightly downregulated at 4 h (0.41-fold) and upregulated at 8 h (1.15-fold) in intestines (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref>). In response to WSSV infection, LvHSF1 expression in hemocytes was dramatically induced, peaking at 8 hours (6.04-fold; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2F</xref>). In the gills, LvHSF1 expression initially increased at 8 hours (2.10-fold) and significantly again at 72 hours (2.80-fold; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2G</xref>). In the intestines, a marked induction of LvHSF1 was observed at 8 hours (2.23-fold; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2H</xref>). These results suggest that LvHSF1 is actively involved in the response to both elevated temperatures and viral (WSSV) infection.</p>

<label>2.3</label><title>Role of LvHSF1 in Restricting WSSV at Low (25 °C) and High (32 °C) Temperatures</title>
<p>To investigate LvHSF1’s role in shrimp during WSSV infection, RNA interference (RNAi) was employed <italic>in vivo</italic>. Two dsLvHSF1 constructs were synthesized: dsLvHSF1-1 (targeting 443-1001 bp) and dsLvHSF1-2 (targeting 1365-1854 bp). Analysis revealed a significant reduction in both transcription and protein levels of LvHSF1 in hemocytes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figs. 3A</xref>, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>) and gills (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figs. 3B</xref>, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>), with dsLvHSF1-1 showing greater silencing efficiency. Consequently, dsLvHSF1-1 was selected for subsequent knockdown experiments. After LvHSF1 knockdown, shrimp were challenged with WSSV, and viral titers were quantified using absolute quantitative PCR. Shrimp with silenced LvHSF1 exhibited increased viral loads in hemocytes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>) and gills (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>) at low temperature (25 °C). Additionally, transcription levels of VP28, one of the major structural proteins of WSSV, were higher in the LvHSF1-silenced group than in the GFP-silenced control in hemocytes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E</xref>) and gills (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3F</xref>). Similarly, the levels of VP28 protein were significantly elevated in the HSF1-silenced group (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figs. 3G</xref>, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3g</xref>). However, no significant difference in shrimp survival rates was observed between LvHSF1-silenced shrimp and GFP-silenced shrimp at low temperature (25 °C) (<italic>p</italic> = 0.8657; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3H</xref>).</p>

<p><bold>(A, B)</bold> Silencing Efficiency of dsRNA-LvHSF1. The efficacy of two dsRNA-LvHSF1 constructs (dsLvHSF1-1 and dsLvHSF1-2) was assessed by qPCR in hemocytes (A) and gills (B). Additionally, protein levels of LvHSF1 were evaluated by western blotting in both tissues (panels a and b). Expression values were normalized against EF-1α and β-Actin using the Livak (2<sup>−ΔΔCT</sup>) method. Data represent the mean ± SD from triplicate assays. (C, D) Quantification of WSSV copies. The quantity of WSSV copies in hemocytes (C) and gills (D) at low temperature (25 °C) post-WSSV infection was determined using absolute quantitative PCR. (E, F) Transcriptional expression of the VP28 gene. The transcriptional expression of the VP28 gene was analyzed by qPCR in hemocytes (E) and gills (F) at low temperature (25 °C) following WSSV infection. (G) Expression of WSSV VP28 protein. Expression of WSSV VP28 protein was detected by western blotting in hemocytes and gills at low temperature (25 °C) after WSSV infection. Quantification and statistical analysis of three independent repeats were performed using ImageJ (panel g). (H) Survival rates of WSSV-infected shrimp post-LvHSF1 knockdown. The survival rates of WSSV-infected shrimp post-LvHSF1 knockdown were monitored at low temperature (25 °C), with recordings made every 4 hours. Statistical analysis was performed using the Kaplan-Meier plot (log-rank χ<sup>2</sup> test). All experiments were conducted with three biological replicates, consistently yielding similar results.</p></caption>

<p>Next, LvHSF1’s role in shrimp during WSSV infection at high temperature (32 °C) was further determined. Notably, the survival rate of LvHSF1-silenced shrimp infected with WSSV was significantly lower than the control group at high temperature (32 °C) (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>). Shrimp with silenced LvHSF1 exhibited increased viral loads in gills (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>) and muscle (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>) at high temperature (32 °C). Additionally, VP28 protein levels were significantly elevated in the LvHSF1-silenced group in gills at high temperature (32 °C; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figs. 4D</xref>, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4d</xref>). These data suggest that LvHSF1 plays a crucial role in antiviral immunity against WSSV infection especially at high (32 °C) temperatures.</p>

<label>2.4</label><title>nSWD as a Potential Antiviral Effector Regulated by LvHSF1</title>
<p>To determine how temperature-induced LvHSF1 restricts WSSV infection, RNA-seq was performed to identify target genes regulated by LvHSF1. Candidates whose expression was inhibited by LvHSF1 knockdown after WSSV infection at high temperature (32 °C) were screened. As shown in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5B</xref>, 8 of the 954 dsHSF1-suppressed genes were predicted to encode effector factors. These differentially expressed genes (DEGs) included immunity-effector molecules, such as antimicrobial peptides and cytokines. Among the 8 candidate genes, particular attention was paid to the <bold>n</bold>ewly identified <bold>s</bold>ingle <bold>w</bold>hey acidic protein <bold>d</bold>omain-containing protein, designated nSWD. The nSWD belongs to type III crustins, which are crustacean cationic cysteine-rich antimicrobial peptides containing one or two whey acidic protein (WAP) domains at the carboxyl terminus and mainly exert antimicrobial activities. The detailed regulatory mechanism of nSWD against WSSV was unclear. To validate the high-throughput sequencing results, the expression level of nSWD and effector molecules were confirmed by qPC, showing a significant reduction in hemocytes and gills after LvHSF1-knockdown (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>; <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>). These results suggest that nSWD may play a pivotal role against WSSV infection regulated by LvHSF1.</p>

<p>To determine whether LvHSF1 regulates the expression of nSWD <italic>in vitro</italic>, a dual-luciferase reporter assay was performed in <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 cells. The promoter region of nSWD was cloned by genome walking, containing two putative conserved HSE motifs located at approximately −1371 to −1359 (HSE-1) and −1035 to −1023 (HSE-2; Supplementary data). The dual-luciferase reporter assay showed that the promoter of nSWD could be regulated by ectopic expression of LvHSF1 in a dose-dependent manner (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figs. 5D</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5d</xref>). Three reporter plasmids containing mutant promoter regions of nSWD with one or no HSE motifs were constructed, named pGL3-nSWD-M1, pGL3-nSWD-M2, and pGL3-nSWD-M12, respectively (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5E</xref>). The reporter assay results showed that the ectopic expression of LvHSF1 could also improve the promoter activity of pGL3-nSWD-M1 and pGL3-nSWD-M2, whereas the activity of pGL3-nSWD-M12 was not upregulated (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figs. 5F</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5f</xref>), suggesting that putative HSE binding motifs play significant roles in LvHSF1-mediated nSWD induction.</p>
<p>To further confirm this, EMSA experiments were performed to investigate the direct interaction between LvHSF1 and HSE motifs of nSWD. Biotin-labeled probes or mutant probes of the HSE motifs were synthesized (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5G</xref>). LvHSF1 protein was purified to verify its ability to bind to the HSE motifs (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 3A</xref> and <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">3B</xref>). The results showed that band shifts of protein-DNA complexes were detected when LvHSF1 protein was incubated with biotin-labeled probe1 but not mutant biotin-labeled probe1 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5H</xref>). Additionally, the band shifts could be competitively reduced when LvHSF1 protein was incubated with wide-type unbiotinylated probe1 at 20- and 100-fold molar excess (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5H</xref>). A similar result was observed in the interaction between LvHSF1 protein and the biotin-labeled probe2 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5H</xref>). No band shift was observed in the control set (GST), suggesting that the interaction between LvHSF1 protein and each of the HSE binding motifs is specific. These results strongly demonstrate that LvHSF1 could regulate the expression of nSWD <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>

<label>2.5</label><title>nSWD Inhibits WSSV Replication and Interacts with WSSV Envelope Proteins</title>
<p>To confirm whether nSWD is involved in WSSV infection, qPCR was performed to determine the expression profile of nSWD. When shrimp were infected with WSSV, the expression of nSWD was upregulated at 4 h (5.66-fold) and 12 h (5.60-fold), remained high at 36 h (5.18-fold) and 48 h (7.90-fold), and slightly downregulated at 72 h (4.74-fold; <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>). To reveal the role of nSWD in WSSV infection at high temperature (32 °C), RNA interference (RNAi) was performed to knock down nSWD expression. The mRNA level of nSWD was effectively suppressed by specific dsnSWD in gills, and the value was downregulated to 0.30-fold of the dsGFP (green fluorescent protein) injection group (as a control) (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref>). The viral load of the dsnSWD group was considerably higher than the control group (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C</xref>).

</fig>
<p>To further demonstrate the actual role of nSWD <italic>in vivo</italic>, RNAi experiments coupled with rnSWD proteins injection were performed. Recombinant proteins of rnSWD and rTrx-His-tag were expressed, purified by SDS-PAGE gels, and confirmed by Coomassie staining (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6E</xref>), and the results were further confirmed by Western blot analysis (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6F</xref>). After knockdown of endogenous nSWD, shrimp samples were treated with WSSV mixed with rnSWD or rTrx-His-tag by intramuscular injection at high temperature (32 °C). Consequently, the viral load of those co-injected with rnSWD was significantly reduced compared to the control group (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01; <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6G</xref>). Additionally, the survival rates of shrimp co-injected with rnSWD were significantly higher than the control group (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01; <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6H</xref>). Therefore, nSWD plays a crucial role in the immune defense against WSSV infection at high temperature (32 °C) <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>
<p>Next, to verify whether the anti-WSSV function of nSWD was mediated by LvHSF1 at high temperature (32 °C), <italic>in vivo</italic> RNAi-LvHSF1 experiments coupled with rnSWD injection were performed. After knockdown of LvHSF1, shrimp samples were treated with WSSV mixed with rnSWD or rTrx-His-tag by intramuscular injection at high temperature (32 °C). The results showed that the viral load of those co-injected with rnSWD was significantly reduced compared to the control group (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01; <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6I</xref>). Additionally, VP28 protein levels of those co-injected with rnSWD were significantly decreased (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6J</xref>, 6j). The survival rates of shrimp co-injected with rnSWD were significantly higher than the control group (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01; <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6K</xref>). These results suggest that the anti-WSSV function of nSWD at high temperature (32 °C) is mediated by LvHSF1.</p>
<p>To reveal the possible anti-WSSV mechanism of nSWD, pull-down assays were performed to detect whether rnSWD protein could interact with WSSV envelope proteins. The main envelope proteins of WSSV, including VP19, VP24, VP26, and VP28 with GST-tags, were from a previous study. In the GST-tagged pull-down assays, rnSWD could interact with VP24 and VP26 based on SDS-PAGE gels with Coomassie blue staining (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7A</xref>), and the result was further confirmed by Western blot analysis with the 6×His antibody (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7B</xref>). Based on the His-tagged pull-down assays, VP24 and VP26 could precipitate rnSWD (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7C</xref>), and this result was further confirmed by Western blot analysis with GST antibody (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7D</xref>). Additionally, confocal analysis confirmed that nSWD colocalized with VP24 (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7E</xref> and <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7e</xref>) and VP26 (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7F</xref> and <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7f</xref>) in <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 cells. Collectively, these results suggest that nSWD could inhibit WSSV replication and bind to VP24 and VP26 of WSSV.</p>

<label>2.6</label><title>Conservation of the Febrile Temperature-Inducible HSF1-AMPs Axis Conferring Virus Resistance in Arthropods</title>
<p>To demonstrate whether HSF1 regulation of antimicrobial peptides is a conserved defense mechanism induced by elevated temperature in arthropods, experiments were performed in an invertebrate model system (<italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 cells). Literature reports that the temperature range for optimal growth of <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 cells is 25–28 °C, and S2 cells tolerated a normal growth temperature of 30 °C. Therefore, S2 cells were cultured at normal temperature (27 °C) or high temperature (30 °C) with or without DCV infection. The results showed that S2 cells were adherent to the wall and grew well at 27 °C or 30 °C without DCV infection, and the cytopathic signs of S2 cells were milder at 30 °C than the control group at 27 °C when infected with DCV (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 4A</xref>). Additionally, the mRNA and protein expression of DCV was significantly lower at 30 °C than the control group at 27 °C (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 4B</xref> and <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">4C</xref>). These results suggest that elevated temperature could restrict the replication of DCV in <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 cells.</p>
<p>To determine whether DmHSF1 is related to high temperature (30 °C) and DCV infection in S2 cells, its expression level was also determined. The results showed that the mRNA expression of DmHSF1 was significantly upregulated 4.53-fold and 6.48-fold at high temperature (30 °C) or infected with DCV, respectively (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8A</xref>). Antimicrobial peptides have been proven to participate in the innate immunity of <italic>Drosophila</italic> in response to viral infection. The expression of DmAMPs (Attacin A, Cecropins A, Defensin, Metchnikowin, and Drosomycin) was explored in response to high temperature (30 °C) and DCV infection. The results showed that Atta, CecA, and Def were significantly upregulated 5.77-fold, 4.55-fold, and 5.40-fold at high temperature (30 °C), respectively (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8B</xref>). When stimulated by DCV, Atta, CecA, Def, Met, and Drs were remarkably increased 46.84-fold, 123.52-fold, 39.72-fold, 41.14-fold, and 241.40-fold, respectively (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8C</xref>).

<p>Next, DmHSF1’s role in <italic>Drosophila</italic> during DCV infection at high temperature (30 °C) was investigated. Using the RNAi strategy in S2 cells, it was observed that the transcription levels of DmHSF1 can be downregulated by dsRNA-DmHSF1 with or without DCV infection (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8D</xref>). After DmHSF1 knockdown, the mRNA and protein expression of DCV was significantly higher at 30 °C than the control group (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8E</xref> and <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">8e</xref>). Additionally, Atta, CecA, and Def were significantly downregulated 0.65-fold, 0.43-fold, and 0.56-fold in DmHSF1 silenced, DCV infected S2 cells at high temperature (30 °C), respectively (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8F</xref>). Furthermore, S2 cells were transfected with pAc5.1a-DmHSF1-HA or pAc5.1a-HA plasmid (as control; <xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 5A</xref>). The results showed that the mRNA and protein expression of DCV was significantly lower at 30 °C than the control group (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8G</xref> and <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">8g</xref>). Accordingly, Atta, CecA, and Def were significantly upregulated 4.38-fold, 1.89-fold, and 3.13-fold at high temperature (30 °C), respectively (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8H</xref>). These results show that high temperature (30 °C) and DCV could induce the expression of DmHSF1 and DmAMPs, with DmHSF1 playing crucial roles in defending against DCV at elevated temperatures.</p>
<p>To further verify whether DmHSF1 exerts its anti-DCV function by regulating DmAMPs at high temperature (30 °C), the regulatory roles of DmHSF1 on DmAMPs were investigated through ectopic expression of DmHSF1 and knockdown of DmAMPs during infection (Supplementary data). Firstly, the promoter region of DmAtta, DmCecA, and DmDef was cloned, each containing three conserved HSE motifs (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8I</xref>). Dual-luciferase reporter assays showed that the promoter of DmAtta, DmCecA, and DmDef could be upregulated 12.36-fold, 7.76-fold, and 2.71-fold by DmHSF1, respectively. The mutant HSE motifs promoter of DmAtta, DmCecA, and DmDef could not be regulated by DmHSF1 (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8J</xref>). Then, to further demonstrate that DmHSF1 exerts its anti-DCV function by regulating DmAMPs, DmAtta was chosen as a representative. After knockdown of DmAtta (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 5B</xref>), S2 cells were transfected with DmHSF1 and then infected with DCV. The results showed that the mRNA and protein expression of DCV was significantly lower at 30 °C than the control group (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8K</xref> and <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">8k</xref>). These results suggest that DmHSF1 exerts its anti-DCV function by regulating DmAMPs at high temperature (30 °C).</p>

<label>3.</label><title>Discussion</title>
<p>Temperature is a key factor regulating various biological activities, and for aquatic ectotherms, it significantly affects growth rates and is also a crucial determinant of viral disease outbreaks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Marcogliese, 2008</xref>). Accumulating evidence has indicated that increased temperature enhances immune competence, resistance to infection, and levels of immune mediators under febrile conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Evans et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Hasday and Singh, 2000</xref>). High temperatures (32-33 °C) have been shown to inhibit the replication of WSSV and reduce mortality in WSSV-infected shrimp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Sun et al., 2014</xref>). Studies have reported that WSSV-infected shrimp reared at high temperatures (above 31 °C) exhibit increased total hemocyte count (THC), phenoloxidase (PO) activity, and apoptotic index (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Granja et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Wu et al., 2015</xref>). However, the mechanism contributing to enhanced pathogen resistance in shrimp at high temperatures remains unclear. In this study, our findings revealed the molecular mechanism through which the HSF-AMPs axis mediates host resistance to viruses induced by febrile temperature. Specifically, AMPs are a newly documented type of effector protein targeted by HSF that mediate the host antiviral response beyond the classical heat shock response.</p>
<p>Regulating body temperature, particularly increasing it (fever), is one of the primary defense mechanisms in homeotherms against infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Hasday et al., 2014</xref>). Ectotherms as diverse as reptiles, fish, insects, and crustaceans also raise their core temperature during infection through behavioral regulation, seeking warmer environments—a phenomenon known as behavioral fever (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Hasday et al., 2014</xref>). This feature, preserved in endothermic mammals and birds, strongly suggests that febrile temperatures confer a survival advantage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bicego et al., 2007</xref>). In 1975, Kluger and colleagues published the first direct experimental study demonstrating the benefits of elevated temperature for infected animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Kluger et al., 1975</xref>). In this study, <italic>dipsosaurus dorsalis</italic>, being poikilothermic animals, were moved from an environment of 36 °C to 40 °C after bacterial infection, resulting in an increase in survival rates from 25% to 65% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Kluger et al., 1975</xref>). Similar results have since been observed in other poikilotherms and some homeotherms. For instance, carp infected with Cyprinid herpesvirus 3 (CyHV-3) move from lower temperatures of 24-28 °C to 32 °C, where their survival rate reaches 100%, and viral load is significantly reduced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Rakus et al., 2017</xref>). Behavioral fever responses to microbial infections have also been reported in aquatic invertebrates such as freshwater crayfish (<italic>Cambarus bartoni</italic>), American lobster (<italic>Homarus americanus</italic>), pink shrimp (<italic>Penaeus duorarum</italic>), horseshoe crab (<italic>Limulus polyphemus</italic>), and <italic>Penaeus vannamei</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Casterlin and Reynolds, 1978</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">1979</xref>; M.E. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Casterlin, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Rakhshaninejad et al., 2023</xref>). Despite these observations, the antimicrobial immune mechanisms induced by febrile temperatures remain unclear. The prevailing view that febrile temperatures benefit the host primarily suggests that febrile response enhances innate and adaptive immune mechanisms in homeotherms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Hasday et al., 2014</xref>). Our findings in the present study further support the enhancement of innate immune mechanisms by febrile temperature in ectotherms such as shrimp and <italic>Drosophila</italic>. Additionally, elevated temperatures can cause some pathogenic microorganisms to lose their optimal growth conditions. However, some microorganisms have evolved strategies to exploit fever to enhance their invasion and proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Freitas Lione et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Loh et al., 2013</xref>). Paradoxically, this further underscores the benefits of fever for the host, as effective immune strategies exert evolutionary pressure on pathogens, driving them to evolve counterstrategies to hijack or block the febrile response.</p>
<p>HSFs are a type of evolutionarily conserved transcription factors initially known for regulating the heat shock response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Anckar and Sistonen, 2011</xref>). However, accumulating evidence indicates multiple additional functions beyond the activation of HSPs, including roles in metabolism, immunity, and disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Barna et al., 2018</xref>). HSF1 acts through a regulated upstream promoter element called the heat shock element (HSE). HSEs are highly conserved, including the inverted repeats of the pentameric sequence nGAAn (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Amin et al., 1988</xref>). The type of HSEs found in the proximal promoter regions of HSP genes comprises at least three contiguous inverted repeats consisting of nTTCnnGAAnnTTCn (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Xiao and Lis, 1988</xref>). The discovery of novel HSF1 target genes not involved in the heat shock response suggests that HSEs may be present in multiple genes beyond HSPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Barna et al., 2018</xref>). For instance, HSF1 can bind to the promoters of CUP1, BTN2, SIS1, SGT2, and SSA3 genes, upregulating their transcriptional activity to regulate oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Morano et al., 2012</xref>). HSF1 also regulates the hypothalamic-specific expression of the heat-inducible ion channel gene TRPV1, suggesting a protective effect during fever (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Fan-xin et al., 2012</xref>). In the present study, we showed that a newly identified antimicrobial peptide, nSWD, is specifically regulated by LvHSF1 via two HSE motifs with the typical nGAAn sequence. Additionally, the promoters of DmAMPs, such as Atta, CecA, and Def, also contain several HSE motifs and are regulated by DmHSF1. Previous studies showed that the upstream sequence of CrustinPm5 contains a putative promoter with an HSE motif, and the expression of CrustinPm5 is upregulated upon heat treatment. However, there is currently no evidence that HSF1 directly binds to the HSE motif of AMPs in invertebrates. Notably, our work is the first to show that HSF1 directly binds to the HSE motifs of AMPs in shrimp and <italic>Drosophila</italic>, suggesting this may be a conserved regulatory mechanism in arthropods.</p>
<p>Although febrile temperature is generally believed to enhance host immunity, the role of heat shock factors (HSFs) in viral infections is complex and varies across different species and types of viral infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Reyes et al., 2022</xref>). In vertebrates, HSF1 has been reported to participate in the transcription of HIV genes and their reactivation from latency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Pan et al., 2016</xref>). Additionally, after orthopoxvirus infection, HSF1 is phosphorylated, translocated into the nucleus, and increases the transcription of HSF1 target genes, benefiting the virus by extending the viral genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Filone et al., 2014</xref>). Conversely, stress-independent activation of HSF1 can reduce the quantity and infectivity of HIV copies in a lymphoblastic cell line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Nekongo et al., 2020</xref>). Another study reported that HSF1 could enable apoptosis-stimulating protein to reduce autophagy in hepatocytes and inhibit HBV replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Wang et al., 2021</xref>). In invertebrates, DmHSF1-deficient adult flies are hypersensitive to DCV infection, although the underlying mechanism has not yet been uncovered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Merkling et al., 2015</xref>). HSF1 is also required for tolerance against several pathogenic agents in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Singh and Aballay, 2006</xref>). Similarly, the present study showed that HSF1 plays a crucial role in antiviral immunity against WSSV infection, with knockdown of HSF1 <italic>in vivo</italic> leading to higher virus copies and increased susceptibility to WSSV infection at high (32 °C) temperature. Notably, a recent study showed that ammonia stress-induced MjHSF1 upregulates the expression of negative regulators that inhibit the production and function of interferon analogs, enhancing WSSV infection in shrimp <italic>Marsupenaeus japonicus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Wang et al., 2024</xref>). This may be because ammonia stress suppresses host immunity and increases sensitivity to pathogenic infection in aquaculture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Weihrauch et al., 2018</xref>). In fact, previous studies have shown that the optimal water temperature for <italic>M. japonicus</italic> growth ranges from 25 to 32 °C, and a high temperature of 31 °C can reduce mortality of WSSV-infected <italic>M. japonicus</italic> without increasing host immune response activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">You et al., 2010</xref>). In contrast, the tolerance temperature for <italic>L. vannamei</italic> growth ranges from 7.5 to 42 °C, and our findings showed that elevated temperature can effectively enhance the host’s response to WSSV infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Millard et al., 2021</xref>). Evidence also supports the involvement of heat shock proteins in WSSV tolerance at elevated temperatures, with heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) playing a crucial role in inhibiting WSSV replication at high temperatures (32 °C) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Lin et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Sun et al., 2014</xref>). These findings suggest that the mechanism of elevated temperature protection against WSSV infection differs between <italic>M. japonicus</italic> and <italic>L. vannamei</italic>. Therefore, our findings, together with those of other studies, suggest that the benefit of HSF1 can be attributed to either the host or the pathogen, depending on the nature and context of the host-virus-environment interaction.</p>
<p>Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are pivotal components of innate immunity in invertebrates, serving as the first line of defense against invading pathogens, including bacteria, fungi, and viruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Brogden, 2005</xref>). Typically, the transcription of AMPs is regulated by the classical NF-κB and JAK/STAT pathways in invertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Carpenter and O’Neill, 2024</xref>). However, our results revealed that AMPs can also be regulated by an alternative pathway mediated by HSF1 in shrimp and <italic>Drosophila</italic>. In crustaceans, various AMP families, including penaeidins, anti-lipopolysaccharide factors, crustins, and stylicins, have been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Matos and Rosa, 2022</xref>). Among these, the newly identified nSWD belongs to type III crustins, characterized by a single WAP domain (SWD) and a short N-terminal region. The most probable anti-WSSV mechanism of nSWD is its direct interaction with WSSV envelope proteins VP24 and VP26, potentially inhibiting viral entry into target cells. VP24 has been identified as a WSSV receptor-binding protein, interacting with the cellular receptor pIgR to mediate WSSV entry into host cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Niu et al., 2019</xref>). VP26 has been reported to bind to SNAP29, inhibiting SNARE complex assembly and autophagic degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Liu et al., 2024</xref>). Additionally, WSSV VP24, VP26, and VP28 form a complex termed an “infectosome”, which is crucial for WSSV infectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Li et al., 2015</xref>). Therefore, the binding of nSWD to WSSV envelope proteins VP24 and VP26 could disrupt WSSV integrity and attenuate viral entry into shrimp cells.</p>
<p>In conclusion, our study demonstrates a conserved antiviral febrile response, where the elevated temperature-induced HSF1-AMP axis plays a crucial role in enhancing host resistance to viruses in shrimp and <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9</xref>). Specifically, febrile temperature-induced HSF1 induces the expression of AMPs, which directly bind to WSSV envelope proteins and inhibit WSSV proliferation. Additionally, high temperature restricts DCV replication in the invertebrate model system <italic>Drosophila</italic>, also mediated by the HSF1-AMPs cascade. These findings highlight previously unforeseen roles of HSF1 beyond the traditional heat shock response, revealing its involvement in thermal regulation of immunity and the innate immune system’s response to thermal stress. Moreover, this study provides new avenues for managing viral infections in arthropods, suggesting that environmental control can effectively enhance disease resistance.</p>

The recombinant GST-tagged VP19, VP24, VP26 and VP28 were obtained from our previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Xiao et al., 2020</xref>). For GST pull-down assays, 5 μg rnSWD was incubated with 5 μg of GST-tagged WSSV protein solution at 4 ℃ for 3 h by agitation. Subsequently, 20 μl of the GST resin were added and the agitation continued for another 2 h. The resin was washed four times with PBS. Finally, the resins were re-suspended in 50 μl of the SDS-PAGE sample buffer, boiled and analyzed by Western blot analysis using 6 × His antibody. For His pull-down assays, 5 μg rnSWD was incubated with 5 μg of GST-tagged WSSV protein solution at 4 ℃ for 3 h by agitation. Subsequently, 20 μl of the Ni-NTA binding resin were added and the agitation continued for another 2 h. The resin was washed four times with PBS. Finally, the resins were re-suspended in 50 μl of the SDS-PAGE sample buffer, boiled and analyzed by Western blot analysis using GST-tag antibody.</p>

<title>Immunocytochemical staining</title>
<p>Immunocytochemical staining was used to observe the co-localization of nSWD and WSSV VP proteins. <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 cells were seeded onto poly-L-lysine-treated glass cover slips in a 24-well plate with approximate 40% confluent. The S2 cells of each well were transfected with 0.5 μg pAc5.1-nSWD-Flag, pAc5.1-VP24-HA or pAc5.1-VP26-HA using the MIK-3000 Transfection Reagent (MIKX, Shenzhen, China). Thirty-six hours post plasmid transfection, cell culture medium was removed, and cells washed with PBS three times. Cells were then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde at 25 °C for 15 min following with methanol permeabilization at - 20 °C for 10 min. After washing sides for three times, cells were blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin (dissolved in PBS) for 60 min at 25 °C and then incubated with rabbit anti-HA antibody (CST, 1:300 diluted in 2% BSA) and mouse anti-Flag antibody (CST, 1:300 diluted in 2% BSA). The slides were then washed with PBS three times and then incubated with anti-rabbit IgG (H+L) Alexa Fluor 488 (CST, 1:1000 diluted in 2% BSA) and anti-mouse IgG (H+L) Alexa Fluor 594 (CST, 1:1000 diluted in 2% BSA) for 60 min at 25 °C in the dark. The cell nuclei were stained with Hoechst (Beyotime, Shanghai, China; cat. no. C1002) for 5 min. Finally, fluorescence was visualized on a confocal laser scanning microscope (Leica TCS-SP8, Wetzlar, Germany).</p>

<p>This study reports an <bold>important</bold> finding on the mechanism underlying the enhancement of anti-viral immune responses by febrile temperatures, especially the role of the conserved heat-shock factor, HSF-1. The data provide <bold>compelling</bold> support for the authors' model wherein increased temperature in the shrimp Litopenaeus vannamei activates HSF1, which in turn enhances anti-viral response via up-regulation of the nSWD protein and antibacterial peptides. The work, which will be of interest to virologists, immunologists, and cell biologists, would benefit from more discussion of the function and roles of HSF-1 at 25°C vs. 32°C.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In the manuscript &quot;Heat Shock Factor Regulation of Antimicrobial Peptides Expression Suggests a Conserved Defense Mechanism Induced by Febrile Temperature in Arthropods,&quot; Xiao and colleagues examine the role of the shrimp Litopenaeus vannamei HSF1 ortholog (LvHSF1) in the response to viral infection. The authors provide compelling support for their conclusions that the activation of LvHSF1 limits viral load at high temperatures. Specifically, the authors convincingly show that (i) LvHSF1 mRNA and protein are induced in response to viral infection at high temperatures, (ii) increased LvHSF1 levels can directly induce the expression of the nSWD (and directly or indirectly other antibacterial peptides, AMPs), (ii) nSWD's antimicrobial activities can limit viral load, and, (iv) LvHSF1 protects survival at high temperatures following virus infection. These data thus provide a model by which an increase in HSF1 levels limits viral load through the transcription of antimicrobial peptides and provides a rationale for the febrile response as a conserved response to viral infection.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The large body of careful time series experiments, tissue profiling, and validation of RNA-seq data is convincing. Several experimental methodologies are used to support the authors' conclusions that nSWD is an LvHSf1 target and increased LvHSF1 alone can explain increased levels of nSWD. Similar carefully conducted experiments also conclusively implicate nSWD protein in limiting WSSV viral loads.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Despite this compelling data regarding the protective role of HSF1 in the febrile response, what remains unexplained and complicates the authors' model is the observation that losing LvHSF1 at 'normal' temperatures of 25C is not detrimental to survival, even though viral loads increase and nSWD is likely still subject to LvHSF1 regulation. These observations suggest that WSSV infection may have other detrimental effects on the cell not reflected by viral load and that LvHSF1 may play additional roles in protecting the organism from these effects of WSSV infection, such as perhaps, perturbations to protein homeostasis. This is worth discussing, especially in light of the rather complicated roles of hormesis in protection from infection, the role of HSF1 in hormesis responses, and the findings from other groups that the authors discuss.</p>

<p>Temperature is a critical factor affecting the progression of viral diseases in vertebrates and invertebrates. In the current study, the authors investigate mechanisms by which high temperatures promote anti-viral resistance in shrimp. They show that high temperatures induce HSF1 expression, which in turn upregulates AMPs. The AMPs target viral envelope proteins and inhibit viral infection/replication. The authors confirm this process in drosophila and suggest that there may be a conserved mechanism of high-temperature mediated anti-viral response in arthropods. These findings will enhance our understanding of how high temperature improves resistance to viral infection in animals.</p>
<p>The conclusions of this paper are mostly well supported by data, but some aspects of data analysis need to be clarified and extended. Further investigation on how WSSV infection is affected by AMP would have strengthened the study.</p>

<p>In the manuscript titled &quot;Heat Shock Factor Regulation of Antimicrobial Peptides Expression Suggests a Conserved Defense Mechanism Induced by Febrile Temperature in Arthropods&quot;, the authors investigate the role of heat shock factor 1 (HSF1) in regulating antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) in response to viral infections, particularly focusing on febrile temperatures. Using shrimp (Litopenaeus vannamei) and Drosophila S2 cells as models, this study shows that HSF1 induces the expression of AMPs, which in turn inhibit viral replication, offering insights into how febrile temperatures enhance immune responses. The study demonstrates that HSF1 binds to heat shock elements (HSE) in AMPs, suggesting a conserved antiviral defense mechanism in arthropods. The findings are informative for understanding innate immunity against viral infections, particularly in aquaculture. However the logical flow of the paper can be improved.</p>
