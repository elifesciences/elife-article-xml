<title>Abstract</title>
<p>While inhomogeneous viscosity has been identified as a ubiquitous feature of the cellular interior, its implications for particle mobility and concentration at different length scales remain largely unexplored. In this work, we use agent-based simulations of diffusion to investigate how heterogenous viscosity affects movement and concentration of diffusing particles. We propose that a nonequilibrium mode of membraneless compartmentalization arising from the convergence of diffusive trajectories into viscous sinks, which we call “diffusive lensing,” can occur in a wide parameter space and is thus likely to be ubiquitous in living systems. Our work highlights the phenomenon of diffusive lensing as a potentially key driver of mesoscale dynamics in the cytoplasm, with possible far-reaching implications for biochemical processes.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Diffusion is a fundamental phenomenon of transport at scales ranging from atoms to galaxies. In cells, diffusion of individual components occurs in a complex, crowded milieu (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Ellis, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Luby-Phelps, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">van den Berg et al., 2017</xref>) that is known to exhibit position-dependent diffusivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Berret, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Garner et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Śmigiel et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Xiang et al., 2020</xref>). Diffusion can occur within or between cellular compartments, where concentrated components carry out chemical reactions. This rich interaction of diffusion and compartmentalization provides the context for cellular biochemistry. Diffusivity varies inversely with viscosity, a key biophysical parameter of the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Bausch et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Hu et al., 2017</xref>) that dictates translational and rotational mobility of proteins and, by extension, possibly influences their activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Huang et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Lippincott-Schwartz et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Pan et al., 2009</xref>). While viscosity has been implicated in modulating or driving a range of cellular processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Molines et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Persson et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Xie et al., 2022</xref>), the role of <italic>inhomogeneous</italic> viscosity in shaping biochemistry by regulating biomolecular concentration and dynamics remains poorly understood. Observation of diverse instances of accumulation across scales motivates our search for uncovering how space-dependent diffusivity affects cell biology. The accumulation of small molecules within the nuclear pore, for instance, has been attributed to diffusion through a viscous region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Ma et al., 2012</xref>). At the macroscale, Chladni patterns are an example of particle concentration resulting from inhomogeneous stochastic transport coefficients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Grabec, 2017</xref>). The implications of inhomogeneous viscosity as a nonequilibrium phenomenon occurring at time scales and length scales relevant to biology remain largely unexplored. Theoretically, more information is required to specify the problem than just the diffusion constant: different mathematical interpretations of the stochastic term in diffusion equations with a spatially inhomogeneous diffusion constant result in different physical predictions (see <italic>Appendix</italic> for more information). Interestingly, diverse mesoscale outcomes are also seen in the case of active biological matter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Bechinger et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Needleman and Dogic, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Yeomans, 2017</xref>), density-dependent concentration of active brownian particles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Cates and Tailleur, 2015</xref>) and size-dependent condensation kinetics in the case of <italic>C. elegans</italic> colony formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Chen and Ferrell, 2021</xref>). While these phenomena focus on motile energy-expending tracers, here we emphasize the underlying space-dependency of a physical property characterizing diffusion. In particular, accumulation arising from inhomogeneous diffusivity may represent a novel mechanism of effective compartmentalization, a key activity for cells in regulating biochemical processes.</p>
<p>In this work, we employ agent-based modeling to explore how position-dependent diffusivity can affect the distribution of tracer particles. We show that under a set of assumptions that relate to the ambiguities intrinsic to modeling inhomogeneous diffusivity (see <italic>Appendix</italic>), viscophoresis (transport due to a viscosity gradient) leads to diffusion trajectories being biased toward areas of higher viscosity, leading to effective compartmentalization and the growth of concentration gradients; we call this effect “diffusive lensing,’’ in non-quantitative analogy to the effects on light rays of media with inhomogeneous refractive index, including refraction and the formation of caustics. Analyzing particle trajectories, we show that viscophoretic transport manifests as anomalous diffusion, albeit unlike the canonical forms seen in the case of homogeneous diffusion in confined setups. We conclude that inhomogeneous diffusivity may have diverse implications for intracellular transport, from sequestering particles to modulating where and when higher-order processes such as clustering happen, in a way that is not predictable from equivalent homogeneous-diffusivity models and could affect biochemical reactions.</p>

<title>Viscophoresis drives particle accumulation</title>
<p>We probed the effect of inhomogeneous diffusivity on particle concentration using agent-based modeling of particle dynamics (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1A</xref>; see <italic>Methods</italic>). In our modeling, the expected macroscale behavior is dictated by the Itô interpretation of heterogeneous diffusion (see <italic>Appendix</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Volpe and Wehr, 2016</xref>). Our model was non-anticipatory in that for a modeled particle traversing an inhomogeneous diffusivity, the step size distribution was defined by the diffusivity at its <italic>present</italic> position. Other equally consistent interpretations (such as the entirely anticipatory “isothermal” interpretation) produce different macroscale behaviors (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1B</xref>). The range of physically-incompatible possibilities resulting from different interpretations is known as the Itô-Stratonovich dilemma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Lau and Lubensky, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Sokolov, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Tupper and Yang, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Van Kampen, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Volpe and Wehr, 2016</xref>). For systems at thermal equilibrium, the isothermal convention best describes transport; however, the nonequilibrium nature of the cellular interior motivates the consideration of non-isothermal conventions; the physically appropriate convention to use depends upon microscopic parameters and timescale hierarchies not captured in a coarse-grained model of diffusion. The equation used here is distinguished from the conventional 1D diffusion equation which arises from Fick’s laws and is only unambiguously true for homogeneous diffusion (characterized by constant diffusivity).</p>
<p>Over the course of the simulation, particles accumulated in the higher-viscosity zone (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A, C</xref>), consistent with steady state closed form Itô-convention solutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Tupper and Yang, 2012</xref>). This accumulation entailed the transient depletion of particles on the less-viscous side of the interface. A similar accumulation was observed in a smooth diffusivity gradient (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B, D</xref>). In both cases, the results from agent-based modeling were corroborated by predictions of the steady-state analytical forms derived from theory. Thus, agent-based simulations demonstrate that under the Itô convention, areas of decreased diffusivity lead to increases in the concentration of diffusing particles. We term this phenomenon “diffusive lensing.”</p>

<title>Interaction-mediated clustering is affected by viscophoresis</title>
<p>Diffusive lensing is an interaction-free mode of concentrating particles that stands in contrast to a more typical paradigm of particle accumulation: interaction-driven formation of higher-order structures like protein complexes, gels, crystals and phase-separated condensates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Banani et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Vekilov, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Wu et al., 2023</xref>). How might interaction-induced clustering be modulated by inhomogeneous diffusion in a cellular context? To address this question, we heuristically modeled inter-particle interactions via a neighbor-sensing scheme in high and low interaction-strength regimes. The scheme involved using a step size for the modeled particle, which decreases as the number of particles in the vicinity increases (see <italic>Methods</italic>). At low interaction strength, clustering occurred only at the low-diffusivity end of a gradient (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>), while the same interaction strength was insufficient to produce clusters in a uniform diffusivity distribution (<xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2A, S2C</xref>). In contrast, a high interaction strength resulted in robust clustering manifesting before particle gradient formation reached the steady state, leading to clustering towards the high-diffusivity side of the simulation region as well (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>). At this high interaction strength, the clustering rate remained the same throughout the region in the absence of a gradient (<xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2B, S2D</xref>). Taken together, the results reveal that viscophoresis can modulate clustering and under certain circumstances cause diffusivity-dependent localized cluster formation, and furthermore that the relative strengths and timescales of each phenomenon quantitatively dictate whether increased clustering will preferentially occur in viscous zones. Similar density-dependent clustering is observed in the case of active Brownian particles during motility-induced phase separation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Cates and Tailleur, 2015</xref>). Effects of diffusive lensing on particle concentration may additionally regulate reaction rates and drive stochastic clustering of enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Jilkine et al., 2011</xref>).</p>

<title><italic>In silico</italic> microrheology shows that viscophoresis manifests as anomalous diffusion</title>
<p>The diffusion coefficient is a fundamental biophysical parameter that affects numerous other phenomena, including biochemical reaction rates. To elucidate particle diffusion at the microscale in the context of viscophoresis, we used an <italic>in silico</italic> implementation of microrheology to analyze particle trajectories (see <italic>Methods</italic>; <xref rid="figS3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3A</xref>). We computed the mean squared displacements (MSDs) for uniform diffusivity simulations (in the case of unencumbered and confined diffusion) and used these to understand how MSD is affected by heterogenous diffusivity in two cases: a continuous diffusivity gradient and a discrete step in diffusivity.</p>
<p>Particle diffusion was unencumbered in the case of large bounds (relative to step size) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>) and confined in the case of small bounds (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>), with the latter demonstrating a transition from anomalous to normal diffusion with time, all in agreement with earlier results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Dix and Verkman, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Saxton, 2007</xref>). The MSD at saturation in homogeneously diffusive systems was found to be agnostic to the underlying uniform diffusivity of the system, indicating that it is exclusively determined by the simulation region size. In contrast, particles in a diffusivity gradient exhibited dynamics intermediate to those of homogeneous high and low diffusivity cases, both in the diffusion coefficient and saturation MSD (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>, inset). The lowering of the saturation MSD reflects particle diffusion occurring within apparent simulation region bounds that confine more than the actual simulation region size. We note that such effective modifications of geometry are also a general feature of optical lensing. Apparent bounds were also found to occur in the two-zone diffusivity case (as in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>) where, at steady-state, particles populated the simulation region non-uniformly (<xref rid="figS3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3B</xref>). For most of the viscosity ratio parameter space, irrespective of whether the smaller zones were more fluid or viscous relative to the bulk, a reduction in MSD was seen indicating effectively lower diffusion bounds (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>). The magnitude of reduction depended on whether most particles resided in the larger or smaller of the two zones. In one observed case <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="505927v3_inline1.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula>, however, the saturation MSD was higher than what was seen in the homogeneous diffusion scenario possibly due to particles robustly populating the bulk milieu followed by directed motion into the viscous zone (similar to that of a Brownian ratchet, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Peskin et al., 1993</xref>)). The saturation MSD was also found to depend on the location of the viscous zone: a more-centered zone resulted in a lowered saturation value, possibly due to weaker ratchet effects (<xref rid="figS3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3C, D</xref>). Note that lensing may cause particle displacements to deviate from a Gaussian distribution, which could explain anomalous behaviors observed both in our simulations and in experiments in cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Parry et al., 2014</xref>). These results point to the insufficiency of using the diffusion coefficient alone to describe diffusion in heterogenous milieu. They also indicate a rich interplay between heterogenous viscosity and anomalous diffusion that requires further investigation.</p>

<title><italic>In silico</italic> FRAP in heterogeneously viscous environments reveals drivers of mesoscale dynamics</title>
<p>The <italic>in silico</italic> microrheology analysis we performed provided insights into dynamics at the single-particle level (i.e., the microscale). To explore collective, emergent behaviors at the mesoscale while continuing to make contact with feasible experiments, we employed an <italic>in silico</italic> version of fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (<italic>in silico</italic> FRAP) (<xref rid="figS4" ref-type="fig">Fig. S4A, B</xref>), in more cell-like inhomogeneous environments. In particular, we modeled viscous patches/granules in a cell using a three-parameter disc-packing setup comprising granule radius (<italic>r</italic>), packing density (<italic>ϕ</italic>) and the ratio of granule viscosity to bulk viscosity <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="505927v3_inline2.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> (see <italic>Methods</italic>). We investigated the effect on dynamics of varying these parameters individually, with the goal of gaining understanding of the effects of varying the amount, nature and distribution of viscogens in cells. In all cases, the <italic>in silico</italic> “photobleaching” event was conducted after the steady-state was attained (<xref rid="figS4" ref-type="fig">Fig. S4C,D,E</xref>). To explain observed changes in the recovery time that would be measured in a FRAP-type experiment, we probed how the mean dwell time of particles in viscous granules varies as a function of these parameters. An increase in the viscosity ratio <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="505927v3_inline3.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> at fixed <italic>ϕ</italic> and <italic>r</italic> resulted in a decline in measured particle mobility, as characterized by an increase in the simulated FRAP <italic>t</italic><sub>1/2</sub> values (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>). Increasing <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="505927v3_inline4.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> from 1 to 10 caused an approximate doubling of <italic>t</italic><sub>1/2</sub> (or halving of diffusivity). Similar reduction in mobility was observed upon variation of <italic>ϕ</italic> or <italic>r</italic> separately, keeping the other (and the viscosity ratio, <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="505927v3_inline5.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula>) constant (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B, C</xref>). The decrease in average mobility in all three cases arose from changes in flux between the viscous and bulk zones, as reflected by an increase in mean dwell times of particles within viscous granules (<xref rid="figS4" ref-type="fig">Fig. S4F,G,H</xref>). Furthermore, such reductions in mobility were emergent in that they arose from the interplay between granular viscosity and bulk-granule fluxes, as the regions of interest in the simulated photobleaching events comprised granules and the surrounding bulk environment. To investigate whether particle dynamics is affected by the underlying topography realizing the system’s viscosity, we averaged the granular and bulk viscosity values to produce weighted-average viscosity values, and compared <italic>in silico</italic> recovery in these simulations to that of the equivalent granule-comprising simulations. Such an averaging of the viscosity to cause an effective uniform mobility for all resident particles resulted in slower dynamics than that of the equivalent granule-comprising simulations (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref>). We conclude that inhomogeneity in viscosity drives rapid effective dynamics via fluxes between the granular (interior) and bulk (exterior) environments, creating “expressways” for particles to move rapidly between viscous regions. The diffusive lensing of particles into viscous zones, and their consequent dwelling in these regions, can be tuned by modulating the underlying viscosity distribution in myriad ways.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The complex milieu of the cellular interior has been recently shown to feature heterogeneous diffusivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Garner et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Huang et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Parry et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Śmigiel et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Xiang et al., 2020</xref>), yet the consequences of such inhomogeneity on compartmentalization and mesoscale molecular dynamics have remained unclear. Through agent-based modeling of diffusion using the Itô integration convention, we show that heterogenous viscosity can lead to simulated particle trajectories converging into viscous hotspots, causing the accumulation of diffusing particles into membraneless compartments defined by the higher-viscosity zones. We term this mode of transport “diffusive lensing”. The underlying conclusions from our 2D simulations extend to 3D directly (see <italic>Methods</italic>). Diffusive lensing has wide-ranging effects on particle distribution and dynamics and, furthermore, it can occur across a wide parameter space. We therefore speculate that diffusive lensing is a ubiquitous phenomenon in living systems.</p>
<p>We found that inhomogeneous diffusivity allows for particle mobility at the microscale and mesoscale to be different from that expected in the presence of homogeneous diffusion. Such an expectation is in line with predicted and observed deviations from normal diffusion in cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Bancaud et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Baum et al., 2014</xref>). The relative strengths of viscophoresis and inter-particle interactions (if any) determined the extent to which clustering was modulated by diffusive lensing: this interplay may be important for determining the effects of inhomogeneous diffusivity on biochemical reaction rates. In these simulations of clustering, particle concentration did not affect diffusivity. In the case that particle concentration decreases diffusivity (for example in the case of branched polysaccharides like glycogen), diffusive lensing may create a positive feedback loop that drives particles into areas where high viscosity has been nucleated. The effect of diffusive lensing on runaway pathological processes like protein aggregation is a potential direction for future work.</p>
<p>Spatially-averaged effective diffusion timescales were found to depend on the microscopic viscosity distribution: the same average diffusivity can give rise to slower or faster dynamics depending on whether it is realized via homogeneous or heterogenous diffusivity distributions. In the latter case, the bulk region interspersed between the viscous hotspots provides “expressways” that contribute to large fluxes at the viscosity interface, thereby accounting for the faster dynamics. Such expressways and their associated fluxes may impact reaction kinetics by altering substrate turnover rates, congruent with the model of unusual transport processes potentially modifying reaction kinetics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Bénichou et al., 2010</xref>). In the context of subcellular viscous regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Garner et al., 2023</xref>), cells may compensate for geometry-imposed constraints on packing density and size of these regions by altering the viscosity ratio (against the bulk milieu) instead. To map the detailed effects of inhomogeneous diffusivity on reaction rates, however, our work suggests that a key prerequisite is to chart a suitable set of metaparameters that provide an adequate description of inhomogeneous diffusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Jin and Verkman, 2007</xref>), as a one-parameter description relying exclusively on the average diffusion coefficient is insufficient to fully specify the dynamics.</p>
<p>Changes in viscosity have been shown to occur in the context of cellular processes including cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Kuimova et al., 2008</xref>), stress adaptation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Persson et al., 2020</xref>) and protein aggregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Thompson et al., 2015</xref>). At any given time point, intracellular transport dynamics arises emergently from contributions across length scales ranging from crowding in the bulk milieu due to proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Wang et al., 2010</xref>) and large biomolecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Delarue et al., 2018</xref>) to cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Carlini et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Chaubet et al., 2020</xref>) and active flows in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Arcizet et al., 2008</xref>), all leading to unusual anomalous diffusive behaviors at the mesoscale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Banks and Fradin, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Bressloff, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Dix and Verkman, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Höfling and Franosch, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Kuznetsova et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Swaminathan et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Zhou et al., 2008</xref>). These diffusive behaviors cannot be decoupled from the intrinsic heterogeneity in biomolecular properties themselves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Heald and Cohen-Fix, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Milo and Phillips, 2015</xref>). The effects of all of these subcellular determinants and energy-dependent processes on how position-dependent diffusivity is maintained in a cell remains unclear.</p>
<p>Not all cases of heterogeneous diffusivity will lead to diffusive lensing. This ambiguity is captured by the so-called Itô-Stratonovich dilemma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Lau and Lubensky, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Sokolov, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Tupper and Yang, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Van Kampen, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Volpe and Wehr, 2016</xref>). Any mathematical conceptualization of diffusion in the presence of position-dependent diffusivity must confront this dilemma, according to which the steady-state concentration distribution of a diffusing tracer depends not only on the localized diffusivity distribution but also on conventions based on microscopic parameters not captured in a coarse-grained model of diffusion; these parameters might, for example, include correlation lengths and times of viscogens or physical characteristics of polymers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Bo et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Lau and Lubensky, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Sokolov, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Tupper and Yang, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Van Kampen, 1988</xref>). While the Itô convention is deployed here to model the nonequilibrium cellular interior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Gnesotto et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Phillips et al., 2012</xref>), in some cases the isothermal convention may be better suited for modeling transport. Indeed, diverse conventions have been used to model experimentally observed accumulation arising from varied sources of such position-dependent noise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Bringuier, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Pesce et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Volpe and Wehr, 2016</xref>).</p>
<p>Our work underscores the need to not only examine viscosity distributions <italic>in vivo</italic> as a function of local composition and the environment, but also to study their time-evolution in response to external stimuli. More speculatively, we suggest that diffusive lensing serves as a potential candidate for a rudimentary mode of pre-biotic compartmentalization. Viscophoresis-driven accumulation of diverse biomolecules may have served to produce chemically enriched spaces, acting as an antecedent of more sophisticated, membrane-bound and membraneless organizational modalities; such a protocell organization is orthogonal to currently studied models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Monnard and Walde, 2015</xref>). This work demonstrates that diffusive lensing can have strong effects on transport and may be common in cellular contexts, modulating both passive and active flows. Future experimental and theoretical work will elucidate the extent of lensing inside and outside of cells and its effects on the biochemical reactions that sustain life.</p>

<title>Agent-based modeling (random walk simulations)</title>
<p>Agent-based modeling of diffusion was conducted via 2D random walk simulations. Irrespective of how the Itô-Stratonovich dilemma is interrogated, the underlying diffusion equations contain additive, separable contributions from each dimension, and this extends to 3D as well. Calculations were, therefore, carried out in 2D for simplicity and visualizability. Non-interacting point particles were initialized uniformly in a 2D simulation region with an aspect ratio matching that of an E. coli bacterium (Phillips et al., n.d.). During each time step (also termed epoch or frame), every particle was moved along each coordinate by step sizes sampled from a uniform distribution, 𝒰(− 𝒮, 𝒮), where 𝒮 denotes the step size limit. Across a large number of steps, the distribution of displacements converges to the normal distribution by virtue of the central limit theorem. While sampling was not performed via the normal distribution directly by using the diffusion coefficient (<italic>D</italic>) as a parameter, the diffusion coefficient was instead arrived at as an emergent property of trajectories comprising a simulation, in a ground-up fashion. Reflection off the wall was modeled using a mirror-image rule. To model a zone of differential viscosity relative to bulk viscosity (either a fluid or a viscous zone), particle step sizes were sampled from zones characterized by different viscosities, noting that the diffusion coefficient and viscosity are inversely related (Phillips et al., n.d.) and <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="505927v3_inline6.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula>. At all times, step sizes were sampled from distributions defined by the diffusivity around the present position in accordance with the Itô interpretation of multiplicative noise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Volpe and Wehr, 2016</xref>) (for theoretical predictions of the steady-state behaviors, see <italic>Numerical methods for the diffusion equations</italic>). In all simulations, a set seed of 1 was used for the random number generator. Simulations were run on MATLAB R2020a on Sherlock (a high-performance computing cluster at Stanford).</p>
<p>In the simulations which included inter-particle interactions, these interactions were modeled via a neighbor-sensing approach. The step size limit was modified as per the relation, <italic>S</italic><sub><italic>eff</italic></sub> = <italic>Se</italic><sup>−<italic>kn</italic></sup>, where <italic>k</italic> denotes the sensing strength and denotes the number of neighbors (defined as those particles lying within a cutoff span around the particle in question). Such a rule-based approach modeled an effective attractive potential for the inter-particle interactions. Local density calculation used the same cutoff and the data were normalized to the mean local density of particles during initialization. Considering the computational work due to neighbor-sensing, a smaller number of particles (10<sup>3</sup>) were deployed, for a longer period 2 × 10<sup>4</sup> of epochs.</p>
<p>In the viscous granule simulations, the granules were modeled as disks with randomly initialized centers and fixed radii (<italic>r</italic>), covering the simulation region up to a desired packing density, <italic>ϕ</italic>. The algorithm saturated for <italic>ϕ</italic> ≥ 0.6, in which case, the disks were generated as per cubic close packing and their positions were incrementally deviated over 10<sup>9</sup> steps to reduce local ordering as much as possible. The ratio of viscosity inside the granules to viscosity outside the granules <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="505927v3_inline7.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> was the third parameter under consideration. No two disks were allowed to overlap and all disks were kept confined within the boundaries of the simulation region. The default setup is as follows: <italic>r</italic> = 0.01 μm (uniform), <italic>ϕ</italic> = 0.6 (that is, 60% of the simulation region is covered by the granules) and <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="505927v3_inline8.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula>. Titration of one of these three parameters involved keeping the other two at the specified levels.</p>

A gaussian well profile was used for the diffusion coefficient and the initial condition for the concentration distribution was a uniform distribution (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1B</xref>).

<p>In silico fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) studies were performed on the diffusion simulations to quantify emergent dynamics at the mesoscale. particles were deployed for a total duration of 0.5 s (10<sup>4</sup> epochs). Circular regions (radius of 0.2 <italic>μm</italic>) were chosen as the regions of interest (ROIs). <italic>In silico</italic> photobleaching was instantaneously performed and involved assigning the particles in the ROI the photobleach status. The background was chosen from a uniform viscosity setup to ensure that the normalization is standardized.

In these simulations, <italic>t</italic><sub>1/2</sub> connotes the time taken for the number of “unbleached” particles in the ROI to reach 50% of the steady-state value. To dissect particles’ behavior during the simulation (in terms of bias towards inhabiting the viscous granules), we calculated the mean dwell time across all particles, per simulation. This involved averaging the periods (of any duration) spent by particles inside viscous granules. For normalization, the total simulation duration was used (0.5 s).</p>

<title>Itô-Stratonovich dilemma and derivation of the generalized flux for heterogeneous diffusion</title>
<p>The Itô-Stratonovich dilemma is an ambiguity which arises directly from any analytical attempt to solve a stochastic differential equation comprising multiplicative (or position-dependent) noise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Amir, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Gardiner, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Van Kampen, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Volpe and Wehr, 2016</xref>). The underlying mathematical reason for the ambiguity is the non-differentiable nature of the stochastic term, which causes different Riemann sum conventions to give quantitatively different results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Gardiner, 2004</xref>). From a more physical point of view, the different conventions correspond to different hierarchies of “small” scales (correlation times and lengths of driving terms or viscogens, for example; see (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Pesce et al., 2013</xref>) for a discussion of competing timescales). Formally, the dilemma can be boiled down to a choice of the parameter, α (0 ≤ α ≤ 1), in a diffusion equation like <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="505927v3_inline12.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula>, where <italic>c</italic>(<italic>x,t</italic>) denotes the concentration distribution and <italic>D</italic>(<italic>x</italic>) denotes the position-dependent diffusivity (see below for the derivation of the generalized flux). Clearly, for a position-dependent diffusivity, different values of α will give rise to different physical predictions. In thermal equilibrium, α must be equal to 1, but away from equilibrium it can take on different values depending on microscopic details of the physical system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Gardiner, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Pesce et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Smythe et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Turelli, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Wang et al., 2020</xref>). Living cells are inherently removed from equilibrium by energy-driven processes breaking detailed balance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Gnesotto et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Phillips et al., 2012</xref>). This motivates the calculations in this work, which use the Itô (α = 0) integration convention, but in fact qualitatively similar results would be observed for any value of α other than 1.</p>
<p>Consider a diffusing tracer whose trajectory is specified by the stochastic process, <italic>X</italic>(<italic>t</italic>). The stochastic process is continuous but is nowhere differentiable: the simplistic case of such a mathematical object is the Wiener process <italic>W</italic>(<italic>t</italic>), also known as Brownian motion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Gardiner, 2004</xref>). Note that in general, however, the stochastic process is characterized by a deterministic drift <italic>a</italic>(<italic>x, t</italic>) and diffusion <italic>b</italic>(<italic>x, t</italic>). Indeed, <italic>X</italic>(<italic>t</italic>) is in fact the solution of the stochastic differential equation (SDE):</p>
<p><italic>dX</italic>(<italic>t</italic>) <italic>= a</italic>(<italic>x, t</italic>)<italic>dt</italic> + <italic>b</italic>(<italic>x, t</italic>)<italic>dW</italic>(<italic>t</italic>), where <italic>dW</italic>(<italic>t</italic>) <italic>=</italic> η(<italic>t</italic>)<italic>dt</italic> denotes the Wiener increment and η(<italic>t</italic>) is the Gaussian white noise.</p>
<p>The stochastic differential equation here comprises multiplicative noise: that is, a position-dependent function, <italic>b</italic>(<italic>x, t</italic>), factors into the noise term of the SDE. This necessitates confronting the Itô-Stratonovich dilemma; we consider a general convention α ∈ [0, 1], where α = 0, 0. 5, 1 correspond to the Itô, Stratonovich and isothermal conventions respectively.</p>
<p>The SDE detailed above corresponds to a Fokker-Planck equation describing the time-evolution of the probability distribution of the tracer, <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="505927v3_inline13.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> (substituting for α yields specific cases; see Eqn. 4.3.20 in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Gardiner, 2004</xref>), Eqns. 2.2.25, 2.2.26 in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Bressloff, 2014</xref>), Table 2 and Discussion in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Tupper and Yang, 2012</xref>)). Setting <italic>a</italic>(<italic>x, t</italic>) (drift) to zero, and <italic>b</italic><sup>2</sup>(<italic>x, t</italic>) (diffusion) to 2<italic>D</italic>, a constant, yields Brownian motion, i.e., the canonical 1D diffusion equation which may also be derived from Fick’s laws. Keeping drift as zero, but setting diffusion to 2<italic>D</italic>(<italic>x</italic>) (space-dependent) yields:</p>
<p><inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="505927v3_inline14.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula>, which describes our scenarios in question. This equation can be simplified as follows:
<disp-formula id="ueqn1">
<alternatives><graphic xlink:href="505927v3_ueqn1.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives>
</disp-formula>
where <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="505927v3_inline15.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> is the generalized flux. Re-writing in terms of concentration yields the final expression, <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="505927v3_inline16.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula>. Substituting for α and calculating <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="505927v3_inline17.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> yields the equations deployed in <italic>Methods: Numerical methods for the diffusion equations</italic>.</p>

<p>The manuscript &quot;Diffusive lensing as a mechanism of intracellular transport and compartmentalization&quot;, explores the implications of heterogeneous viscosity on the diffusive dynamics of particles. The authors analyze three different scenarios:</p>
<p>(i) diffusion under a gradient of viscosity,</p>
<p>(ii) clustering of interacting particles in a viscosity gradient, and</p>
<p>(iii) diffusive dynamics of non-interacting particles with circular patches of heterogeneous viscous medium.</p>
<p>The implications of a heterogeneous environment on phase separation and reaction kinetics in cells are under-explored. This makes the general theme of this manuscript very relevant and interesting. However, the analysis in the manuscript is not rigorous, and the claims in the abstract are not supported by the analysis in the main text.</p>
<p>Following are my main comments on the work presented in this manuscript:</p>
<p>(a) The central theme of this work is that spatially varying viscosity leads to position-dependent diffusion constant. This, for an overdamped Langevin dynamics with Gaussian white noise, leads to the well-known issue of the interpretation of the noise term. The authors use the Ito interpretation of the noise term because their system is non-equilibrium.</p>
<p>One of the main criticisms I have is on this central point. The issue of interpretation arises only when there are ill-posed stochastic dynamics that do not have the relevant timescales required to analyze the noise term properly. Hence, if the authors want to start with an ill-posed equation it should be mentioned at the start. At least the Langevin dynamics considered should be explicitly mentioned in the main text. Since this work claims to be relevant to biological systems, it is also of significance to highlight the motivation for using the ill-posed equation rather than a well-posed equation. The authors refer to the non-equilibrium nature of the dynamics but it is not mentioned what non-equilibrium dynamics to authors have in mind. To properly analyze an overdamped Langevin dynamics a clear source of integrated timescales must be provided. As an example, one can write the dynamics as</p>
<p>
Eq. (1) \dot x = f(x) + g(x) \eta , which is ill-defined if the noise \eta is delta correlated in time but well-defined when \eta is exponentially correlated in time. One can of course look at the limit in which the exponential correlation goes to a delta correlation which leads to Eq. (1) interpreted in Stratonovich convention. The choice to use the Ito convention for Eq. (1) in this case is not justified.</p>
<p>(b) Generally, the manuscript talks of viscosity gradient but the equations deal with diffusion which is a combination of viscosity, temperature, particle size, and particle-medium interaction. There is no clear motivation provided for focus on viscosity (cytoplasm as such is a complex fluid) instead of just saying position-dependent diffusion constant. Maybe authors should use viscosity only when talking of a context where the existence of a viscosity gradient is established either in a real experiment or in a thought experiment.</p>
<p>(c) The section &quot;Viscophoresis drives particle accumulation&quot; seems to not have new results. Fig. 1 verifies the numerical code used to obtain the results in the later sections. If that is the case maybe this section can be moved to supplementary or at least it should be clearly stated that this is to establish the correctness of the simulation method. It would also be nice to comment a bit more on the choice of simulation methods with changing hopping sizes instead of, for example, numerically solving stochastic ODE.</p>
<p>A minor comment, the statement &quot;the physically appropriate convention to use depends upon microscopic parameters and timescale hierarchies not captured in a coarse-grained model of diffusion.&quot; is not true as is noted in the references that authors mention, a correct coarse-grained model provides a suitable convention (see also Phys. Rev. E, 70(3), 036120., Phys. Rev. E, 100(6), 062602.).</p>
<p>(d) The section &quot;Interaction-mediated clustering is affected by viscophoresis&quot; makes an interesting statement about the positioning of clusters by a viscous gradient. As a theoretical calculation, the interplay between position-dependent diffusivity and phase separation is indeed interesting, but the problem needs more analysis than that offered in this manuscript. Just a plot showing clustering with and without a gradient of diffusion does not give enough insight into the interplay between density-dependent diffusion and position-dependent diffusion. A phase plot that somehow shows the relative contribution of the two effects would have been nice. Also, it should be emphasized in the main text that the inter-particle interaction is through a density-dependent diffusion constant and not a conservative coupling by an interaction potential.</p>
<p>(e) The section &quot;In silico microrheology shows that viscophoresis manifests as anomalous diffusion&quot; the authors show that the MSD with and without spatial heterogeneity is different. This is not a surprise - as the underlying equations are different the MSD should be different. There are various analogies drawn in this section without any justification:</p>
<p>
(i) &quot;the saturation MSD was higher than what was seen in the homogeneous diffusion scenario possibly due to particles robustly populating the bulk milieu followed by directed motion into the viscous zone (similar to that of a Brownian ratchet, (Peskin et al., 1993)).&quot;</p>
<p>
(ii) &quot;Note that lensing may cause particle displacements to deviate from a Gaussian distribution, which could explain anomalous behaviors observed both in our simulations and in experiments in cells (Parry et al., 2014).&quot;</p>
<p>
Since the full trajectory of the particles is available, it can be analyzed to check if this is indeed the case.</p>
<p>(f) The final section &quot;In silico FRAP in a heterogeneously viscous environment ... &quot; studies the MSD of the particles in a medium with heterogeneous viscous patches which I find the most novel section of the work. As with the section on inter-particle interaction, this needs further analysis.</p>
<p>To summarise, as this is a theory paper, just showing MSD or in silico FRAP data is not sufficient. Unlike experiments where one is trying to understand the systems, here one has full access to the dynamics either analytically or in simulation. So just stating that the MSD in heterogeneous and homogeneous environments are not the same is not sufficient. With further analysis, this work can be of theoretical interest. Finally, just as a matter of personal taste, I am not in favor of the analogy with optical lensing. I don't see the connection.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
The authors study through theory and simulations the diffusion of microscopic particles and aim to account for the effects of inhomogeneous viscosity and diffusion - in particular regarding the intracellular environment. They propose a mechanism, termed &quot;Diffusive lensing&quot;, by which particles are attracted towards high-viscosity regions where they remain trapped. To obtain these results, the authors rely on agent-based simulations using custom rules performed with the Ito stochastic calculus convention, without spurious drift. They acknowledge the fact that this convention does not describe equilibrium systems, and that their results would not hold at equilibrium - and discard these facts by invoking the fact that cells are out-of-equilibrium. Finally, they show some applications of their findings, in particular enhanced clustering in the high-viscosity regions. The authors conclude that as inhomogeneous diffusion is ubiquitous in life, so must their mechanism be, and hence it must be important.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
The article is well-written, and clearly intelligible, its hypotheses are stated relatively clearly and the models and mathematical derivations are compatible with these hypotheses.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
The main problem of the paper is these hypotheses. Indeed, it all relies on the Ito interpretation of the stochastic integrals. Stochastic conventions are a notoriously tricky business, but they are both mathematically and physically well-understood and do not result in any &quot;dilemma&quot; [some citations in the article, such as (Lau and Lubensky) and (Volpe and Wehr), make an unambiguous resolution of these]. Conventions are not an intrinsic, fixed property of a system, but a choice of writing; however, whenever going from one to another, one must include a &quot;spurious drift&quot; that compensates for the effect of this change - a mathematical subtlety that is entirely omitted in the article: if the drift is zero in one convention, it will thus be non-zero in another in the presence of diffusive gradients. It is well established that for equilibrium systems obeying fluctuation-dissipation, the spurious drift vanishes in the anti-Ito stochastic convention (which is not &quot;anticipatory&quot;, contrarily to claims in the article, are the &quot;steps&quot; are local and infinitesimal). This ensures that the diffusion gradients do not induce currents and probability gradients, and thus that the steady-state PDF is the Gibbs measure. This equilibrium case should be seen as the default: a thermal system NOT obeying this law should warrant a strong justification (for instance in the Volpe and Wehr review this can occur through memory effects in robotic dynamics, or through strong fluctuation-dissipation breakdown). In near-equilibrium thermal systems such as the intracellular medium (where, although out-of-equilibrium, temperature remains a relevant and mostly homogeneous quantity), deviations from this behavior must be physically justified and go to zero when going towards equilibrium.</p>
<p>Here, drifts are arbitrarily set to zero in the Ito convention (the exact opposite of the equilibrium anti-Ito), which is the equilibrium equivalent to adding a force (with drift $- grad D$) exactly compensating the spurious drift. If we were to interpret this as a breakdown of detailed balance with inhomogeneous temperature, the &quot;hot&quot; region would be effectively at 4x higher temperature than the cold region (i.e. 1200K) in Fig 1A.</p>
<p>It is the effects of this arbitrary force (exactly compensating the Ito spurious drift) that are studied in the article. The fact that it results in probability gradients is trivial once formulated this way (and in no way is this new - many of the references, for instance, Volpe and Wehr, mention this). Enhanced clustering is also a trivial effect of this probability gradient (the local concentration is increased by this force field, so phase separation can occur). As a side note the &quot;neighbor sensing&quot; scheme to describe interactions is very peculiar and not physically motivated - it violates stochastic thermodynamics laws too, as the detailed balance is apparently not respected. Finally, the &quot;anomalous diffusion&quot; discussion is at odds with what the literature on this subject considers anomalous (the exponent does not appear anomalous).</p>
<p>The authors make no further justification of their choice of convention than the fact that cells are out-of-equilibrium, leaving the feeling that this is a detail. They make mentions of systems (eg glycogen, prebiotic environment) for which (near-)equilibrium physics should mostly prevail, and of fluctuation-dissipation (&quot;Diffusivity varies inversely with viscosity&quot;, in the introduction). Yet the &quot;phenomenon&quot; they discuss is entirely reliant on an undiscussed mechanism by which these assumptions would be completely violated (the citations they make for this - Gnesotto '18 and Phillips '12 - are simply discussions of the fact that cells are out-of-equilibrium, not on any consequences on the convention).</p>
<p>Finally, while inhomogeneous diffusion is ubiquitous, the strength of this effect in realistic conditions is not discussed (this would be a significant problem if the effect were real, which it isn't). Gravitational attraction is also an ubiquitous effect, but it is not important for intracellular compartmentalization.</p>
<p>To conclude, the &quot;diffusive lensing&quot; effect presented here is not a deep physical discovery, but a well-known effect of sticking to the wrong stochastic convention.</p>
