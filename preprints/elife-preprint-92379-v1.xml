<title>Abstract</title><p>A productive HIV-1 infection in humans is often established by transmission and propagation of a single transmitted/founder (T/F) virus, which then evolves into a complex mixture of variants during the lifetime of infection. An effective HIV-1 vaccine should elicit broad immune responses in order to block the entry of diverse T/F viruses. Currently, no such vaccine exists. An in-depth study of escape variants emerging under host immune pressure during very early stages of infection might provide insights into such a HIV-1 vaccine design. Here, in a rare longitudinal study involving HIV-1 infected individuals just days after infection in the absence of antiretroviral therapy, we discovered a remarkable genetic shift that resulted in near complete disappearance of the original T/F virus and appearance of a variant with H173Y mutation in the variable V2 domain of the HIV-1 envelope protein. This coincided with the disappearance of the first wave of strictly H173-specific antibodies and emergence of a second wave of Y173-specific antibodies with increased breadth. Structural analyses indicated conformational dynamism of the envelope protein which likely allowed selection of escape variants with a conformational switch in the V2 domain from an α-helix (H173) to a β-strand (Y173) and induction of broadly reactive antibody responses. This differential breadth due to a single mutational change was also recapitulated in a mouse model. Rationally designed combinatorial libraries containing 54 conformational variants of V2 domain around position 173 further demonstrated increased breadth of antibody responses elicited to diverse HIV-1 envelope proteins. These results offer new insights into designing broadly effective HIV-1 vaccines.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>While combinatorial antiretroviral therapy has greatly improved the life expectancy of people living with HIV, it doesn’t cure the infection even with life-long adherence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>). In the absence of a preventative vaccine, HIV-1 continues to be a global public health concern, causing ∼1.5 million new infections annually (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>). After dozens of HIV-1 vaccine failures in the last four decades, the only vaccine trial that showed promise was the phase 3 RV144 trial conducted in Thailand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>). The RV144 demonstrated an early efficacy of ∼60% reduction in HIV acquisition at 12-months post-vaccination which gradually declined to 31.2% at 42 months (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>). Several studies demonstrated correlation of IgG antibodies specific to the V2 variable domain of the HIV envelope protein (Env) to vaccine efficacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>). Notably, protection was not due to their ability to neutralize the virus but likely due to the Fc effector function, specifically the antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity (ADCC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>). Furthermore, sieve analysis of the breakthrough infections in RV144 vaccinees showed mutations in the V2 domain, in the semi-conserved structural core encompassing residues 166 to 183, which seems to be one of the prime targets of the host immune pressure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>). Therefore, broadening the vaccine-induced immunity against the V2 region can potentially confer protection against breakthrough infections. Additionally, there have been concerted efforts to generate vaccine-induced broadly neutralizing antibodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>) but remains challenging and elusive.</p>
<p>The Env spike on the surface of HIV forms essential interactions with its primary receptor, CD4, followed by interactions with the CCR5/CXCR4 co-receptor on a CD4+ T cell for viral entry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>). In addition to CD4 and CCR5/CXCR4 receptors, interaction of the V2 region with integrin α4β7 has also been implicated as a significant contributor in the pathogenesis of HIV-1, particularly for dissemination and gut-reservoir establishment in the infected individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>). It has been shown that the V2 domain by virtue of mimicking MadCAM, a natural ligand of α4β7, assists in co-stimulation of CD4+ T cells promoting HIV-1 replication during an acute stage of infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>). Furthermore, vaccinees of the RV144 trial generated non-neutralizing V2 antibodies that are shown to block interaction with α4β7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>).</p>
<p>Env is expressed as a 160 kD glycoprotein (gp160) and cleaved by the cellular protease furin into gp120 and gp41 subunits. The membrane-external subunit, gp120, has five conserved regions (C1, C2, C3, C4 and C5) and five variable regions (V1, V2, V3, V4 and V5) that are alternately positioned in the Env sequence with the exception of V1V2 variable regions that assemble as a single domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>). Three protomers, each composed of non-covalently associated gp120 and gp41 subunits, assemble as a trimeric spike on the viral envelope. The three V1V2 domains form a well-exposed “crown” of the mushroom-shaped spike, hence a frequent target of the host immune system. Each V1V2 domain consists of a conserved Greek-key motif structure with 4-5 β-strands (A, B, C, C’, D) forming an anti-parallel β-sheet and two hypervariable loops that are flexible and conformationally dynamic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>). The virus takes advantage of these features to engage in immune battles with the host defenses and selecting mutations, particularly in the hypervariable loops that can escape host immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>). The V1V2 domain of HIV-1 envelope protein is therefore an attractive target for a preventative vaccine design.</p>
<p>The human host is often exposed to a complex genetic pool of highly diverse and heterogeneous viral quasispecies from an infected donor of which only one (or a few) transmitted founder (T/F) virus can successfully establish a productive infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>). However, very little is known about how the T/F viruses emerge out of the exposed variants or how they might escape the initial host immune responses to establish chronic infections. Moreover, how the structural and conformational dynamics of the variable V1V2 domain might contribute to mechanisms of immune escape remains poorly understood. Here, we investigated the mechanism of escape of a T/F virus from V2-directed host immune responses in an acutely infected participant of a prospective acute HIV cohort, RV217 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>). RV217 is a unique and rare clinical trial in which HIV infection could be tracked starting from just days after infection up to nearly three years in the absence of antiretroviral therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>). Our studies discovered a remarkable genetic shift in the T/F virus population due to a key mutation, H173Y, in the semi-conserved epitope of the V2 domain, which rendered the pre-existing antibody responses completely obsolete. Furthermore, this mutation caused a conformational shift of the V2-epitope to which the human host responded with more broadly reactive antibody responses, a phenomenon that we show could be recapitulated in a mouse model. We further show that combinatorial V2 immunogen libraries comprised of 54 naturally occurring conformational variants at or near H173 elicited antibody responses with increased breadth to diverse HIV-1 envelope proteins. These studies provide new insights into effective design of future HIV vaccines that could induce broad immunity against diverse strains of HIV-1.</p>

<sec id="s2a">
<title>Hypothesis and experimental design</title>
<p>We hypothesized that understanding how a T/F virus escapes host immune pressure at the very early stages of infection might identify key mutations that if included in a HIV vaccine could stimulate broader immune responses and preemptively interfere or block HIV acquisition. Our primary focus is the V1V2 domain of HIV-1 Env, one of the key determinants of virus escape in the moderately successful RV144 vaccine trial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>). We therefore decided to study the evolution of V1V2 domain in the T/F viruses from four HIV-1 infected participants of RV217 Early Capture HIV Cohort (ECHO) project, a unique and rare trial that allowed tracking of HIV infection starting from just days after infection in the absence of antiretroviral therapy.</p>
<p>First, we performed phylogenetic analyses of longitudinal Env sequences to identify V1V2-specific variants that correlated with T/F virus escape (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). Next, the selected escape variants were fused with the oligomeric (11- and 12-mers) bacteriophage (phage) T4 small “terminase” protein, gp16, to generate V1V2 epitope-displaying nanoscaffolds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>) for effective antigen presentation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>). These constructs were then expressed in HEK293GnTi (GnTi) cells to produce gp16-scaffolded V1V2 escape mutant domains with native-like high mannose glycosylation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>). Next, the immunogenicity of the V1V2 variants was evaluated in a mouse model to determine if they could recapitulate the distinctive escape mutant-specific immune responses observed in the human plasma (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>). Finally, cocktails of V1V2 variant-targeted immunogen pools were created using controlled mutagenesis to determine the effect of escape mutation on the antibody response and recognition of diverse HIV-1 Env antigens in the context of a library designed with and without escape mutations (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>). Since V2 is known to be a very conformationally polymorphic region of the Env, we hypothesized that if the escape mutations identified in the T/F virus would have dominant effect of on the conformation and subsequent antibody response despite other V2 mutations. Identifying such conformation influencing V2 residues might inform effective vaccine design.</p>

<title>Phylogenetic analyses identified a striking H173Y escape mutation in the V2 domain of a T/F virus</title>
<p>A series of HIV-1 viral <italic>env</italic> sequences were isolated from four HIV-1 infected participants (<italic>referred here as participants – 7, 61, 94 and 100</italic>) of the RV217 ECHO project through single genome amplification (SGA). Using a sensitive nucleic acid test, each study participant was confirmed of HIV-1 positivity just days after a negative test (Fiebig stage I) and none of these participants were on antiretroviral therapy during the timeframe of the study. <italic>Env</italic> sequences were obtained at three time points, wks 1, 4 (∼1 month), and 24 (∼6 months) following the positive test. That a single T/F virus was responsible for infection in each participant was further ascertained by aligning independently isolated <italic>env</italic> sequences from wk 1 plasma, which were nearly identical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>). Additionally, plasma viral load with peak, nadir, and set point viremia shown for one representative patient (participant 7) indicated a typical pattern of early captured infection (Fig. S1). Around 30 sequences were analyzed from each patient (median of 10 sequences per visit), with 152 sequences in total across all four patients, over a period of up to 6 months post-infection.</p>
<p>To trace viral phylogeny for each of the T/F viruses (hereafter referred to as T/F07, T/F61, T/F94 and T/F100), the longitudinal <italic>env</italic> sequences were translated to protein sequences and aligned. Multiple sequence alignments were then used to construct phylogenetic trees using the respective T/F virus <italic>env</italic> sequence as the root for the tree construction (Fig. S2). Of the four T/F viruses, T/F61 showed a few dominant mutations with relatively conserved V1V2 region, while T/F100 was found to be the most rapidly diverged virus with mutants appearing at as early as one wk after infection. By wk 4, a major branch of diverging T/F100 viruses harboring mutations in the V1V2 domain appeared. In addition, there were mutations in V5 variable loop and the less conserved α2 helix of C3 constant region. T/F94 virus also acquired various mutations including deletions in the variable V1V2 and V5 regions. Not surprisingly, most of these mutations are in the surface-exposed variable regions of HIV-1 trimer with hotspots in the loop regions (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A-B</xref>).</p>

<p>On the other hand, T/F07 virus did not show any variants until wk 4. At 24-wk post-infection, however, nearly the entire T/F07 virus population made a complete shift to a single variant containing two mutations, one at position 173 that changed histidine to tyrosine (H173Y) and another at position 236 that changed lysine to threonine (K236T). The K236T mutation restored the well-conserved N-linked glycan at position N234 located at gp120/gp41 interface. Additionally, in some of the variants, a 3-residue deletion in the variable V2 loop (ΔDSV) and a 5-residue deletion (ΔNTTRFL) in the variable V4 loop co-occurred with the H173Y mutation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C-D</xref>).</p>
<p>The H173Y mutation is localized in the relatively well-conserved “C” β-strand positioned at the junction of the cationic first half and the hydrophobic second half of the β-strand (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref>). These characteristics, a singular variant and the remarkable shift of the viral population, strongly suggested a linkage between the variant and potential viral escape. This was in contrast to many mutations observed in the other three T/F viruses in the hypervariable V1 and V2 loops (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2F</xref>) which are difficult to track and of little value for vaccine design. Furthermore, the distinct (and complex) evolutionary trajectories taken by different T/F viruses highlighted the breadth of immune responses needed for an effective HIV-1 vaccine design.</p>

<title>The H173Y mutation in C β-strand of V2 domain is a key determinant of virus escape against host immune pressure</title>
<p>The divergence of nearly the entire T/F07 virus population to H173Y variant made it a strong candidate for a viral escape mechanism. H173 is located in the C β-strand of V1V2 domain, a region that in previous studies was also found to be a critical target for host immune responses by RV144 trial vaccines. To determine if this mutant indeed arose through a strong selection against V2-directed antibody responses, the epitope specificity of antibodies was evaluated in the longitudinal plasma samples. The V1V2 domains, but not the full-length Env proteins, were used for testing in order to exclude the binding responses directed against other regions of the envelope protein. Four V1V2 domain recombinants were constructed using the phage T4 small terminase subunit gp16 (18 kDa) as a nanoscaffold: gp16-H173 (“wild-type” T/F07) and three 24- wk V2 mutants namely, gp16-H173Y (Y173), gp16-ΔDSV, and gp16-Y173+ΔDSV. Gp16 is a well-characterized oligomer that forms highly soluble and stable 11-mer and 12-mer ring structures. The V1V2 domains with a StrepTag fused to the C-terminus of gp16 are expected to decorate the nanoscaffold. These were expressed in GnTi cells, affinity-purified by StrepTactin chromatography (Fig. S3) and used to capture the respective V1V2-specific antibody titers in the longitudinal plasma samples of participant 7 by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) assay.</p>
<p>The data revealed remarkable epitope specificity to the V2 domain of the original T/F07 virus, but not to the H173Y variant, at 24-wk post-infection. The antibodies bound strongly to V1V2-H173 and V1V2-H173.ΔDSV scaffolds but failed to bind to the Y173 variant scaffolds V1V2-Y173 and V1V2-Y173.ΔDSV (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). These data demonstrated that the H173Y mutation is a key determinant in epitope switching at the time of virus escape against host immune pressure. No significant difference was observed with the DSV deletion mutants, though it might have played an accessory role (see below).</p>

<p>Following this first “wave” of antibodies specific to T/F07-H173 epitope, there was a second wave after the virus escape when the virus population switched to the resistant Y173 variant. SPR analyses showed that, contrary to the first wave, this second wave of antibodies exhibited increased breadth, recognizing both the V1V2-H173 and V1V2-Y173 variants (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>; see the peak at 1.4 years). Therefore, the second wave antibodies would be able to restrict both the original T/F07 H173 virus as well as the escaped Y173 variant. Collectively, these data strongly suggest that the V2-region, in particular the C β-strand, is a critical target for mounting immune pressure by host during the acute HIV infection.</p>

<title>Recapitulation of escape mutant specificity in monoclonal antibodies from RV144 vaccinees</title>
<p>Next, we evaluated the binding of V2-H173 and V2-Y173 variants to the C β-strand-specific monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) CH58 and CH59 that were isolated from the RV144 trial vaccinees. These antibodies were previously reported to bind to H173 C β-strand present in the gp120 immunogen used in the RV144 vaccine trial, and the moderate protection observed in the RV144 trial correlated with such V2 C β-strand-specific antibody responses. Remarkably, while the V1V2-H173 scaffolds bound strongly to both CH58 and CH59 antibodies, the V1V2-Y173 escape variant either failed to bind (CH59) or showed drastically reduced binding (CH58). The DSV deletion again did not show a significant difference in the binding specificity (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B-D</xref>).</p>
<p>We then evaluated the ADCC responses as these were identified as one of the correlates for protection in RV144 vaccinees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>). We determined the relative ADCC responses in the participant 7 plasma against the C β-strand variants. We constructed the gp120 ectodomain versions of the V1V2 domain variants; gp120-H173 (T/F07), gp120-Y173, and gp120-Y173.ΔDSV (escape mutants), and gp120-92Th023 (control), expressed each in GnTi cells, and purified the recombinant proteins. These were then coated on the target cells and ADCC killing by effector cells (healthy PBMCs) was measured by Granzyme activity using wk0, wk4 and wk24 plasma samples of participant 7. The data showed moderate ADCC responses against the H173 T/F07, whereas resistance to killing was observed for the Y173 mutants, with the Y173.ΔDSV double mutant showing more resistance than the Y173 single mutant (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). This implicates a potential functional role for ΔDSV mutation against ADCC-type immune pressure, though it had no significant impact on recognizing the binding epitope(s). Furthermore, significant resistance was also observed for both the Y173 variants against CH58 mAb mediated ADCC killing, while no resistance was detected against a negative control CH65 Flu antibody.</p>

<title>Recapitulation of V2-specific human immune responses in mice</title>
<p>We then hypothesized that the dramatic escape of H173Y mutant viruses might be because the histidine to tyrosine substitution caused a significant structural/conformational change in the C β- strand epitope such that it is no longer recognized by H173-specific antibodies. There is evidence that the C β-strand is conformationally dynamic and that it can take a helical form when bound to certain antibodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>). This is also consistent with the distinct specificities of human antibodies generated against these variants, in participant 7, i.e., strict specificity of T/F07 plasma for H173 and increased breadth in the case of escaped plasma for both H173 and Y173 (as shown in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref>). Could this be recapitulated through immunogen design, in the absence of viral infection? To address this question, we immunized BALB/c mice (6 mice/group) with V1V2 nanoscaffolds containing four different V2 variants; H173, Y173, ΔDSV, and Y173.ΔDSV, and analyzed the specificity of the elicited antibody responses (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>).</p>

<p>To determine the V2 variant epitope-specific antibody titers, we constructed the His-tagged gp140 Env recombinants H173, Y173, ΔDSV, or Y173.ΔDS, expressed in GnTi cell, and the purified Env proteins were used as the coating antigens. These gp140 Envs allowed evaluation of V2 epitope specificity in the native gp140 Env context and also filtered out the gp16 scaffold- and strep-tag-specific antibody titers. The ELISA data showed that all the V1V2 variant scaffolds elicited robust V2-specific antibodies that recognized the V2 epitopes in the context of gp140 Env (Fig. S4 and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>). This is notable because the V2 antibodies elicited against multiple scaffolded V2 immunogens tested previously, did not recognize the V2 epitopes in gp140 Env context, though they bound to the scaffold used for immunization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>). The end point titers were on the order of ∼10<sup>5</sup> in the immunized mice while the naïve controls showed no significant V2-specific titers. These results demonstrated high level of immunogenicity and specificity to native Env by the gp16-scaffolded V1V2 variants.</p>
<p>We then tested the epitope specificity of the V2-specific antibodies using a series of 15-mer biotinylated peptides spanning the C β-strand by a sensitive Biacore SPR assay (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>). Remarkably, the T/F07 H173-induced sera reacted strongly with H173 C strand peptide but poorly with Y173 and other variant peptides (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D</xref>). In contrast, the escape mutant Y173- induced sera showed broad reactivity to both H173 and Y173 peptides as well as to other variant peptides containing C β-strand epitope. Moreover, the level of reactivity of Y173 antibodies to peptides was low overall when compared to the same with the gp140 Env proteins probably because these antibodies are conformation-specific (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5E</xref>). Thus, the mice sera recapitulated the behavior of H173 and Y173 antibodies produced in a human infection. Furthermore, the ΔDSV deletion enhanced and broadened the reactivity of the antibodies (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5F-G</xref>), which is consistent with the ADCC assays where the ΔDSV mutation showed enhanced resistance to cell killing.</p>

<title>H173 and Y173 variants induce antibodies of distinct specificities</title>
<p>To further define the specificities of H173- and Y173-induced sera, we evaluated their ability to recognize HIV-1 Env proteins from different clades and determine their cross-reactivity. Accordingly, we constructed a series of recombinant clones and purified gp140 Env proteins from different T/F viruses, mutants, and clades: CRF_AE proteins T/F07-H173, T/F07-H173Y, T/F07-ΔDSV, T/F07-H173Y.ΔDSV, T/F61, T/F94, and T/F100, clade A [BG505], clade B [SF162 and JRFL], and clade C [1086] (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>). Their reactivity was tested using sera of mice immunized with the four V1V2 nanoscaffolds (Fig. S5). The data showed that the T/F07 H173- and ΔDSV- induced antibodies reacted with autologous T/F07 Env proteins, and with clades C-1086 and AE244 HIV Envs that encode C-strand sequence closely resembling the T/F07 sequence. On the other hand, the Y173 and Y173.ΔDSV induced antibodies reacted broadly with all the proteins tested, and more strongly overall than the T/F07-induced sera as evident from the heat map and the summarized binding response (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B-C</xref>). From these, it is reasonable to conclude that the H173 immunogen induced antibodies with narrow specificity to C β-strand whereas the Y173 immunogen induced more broadly reactive antibodies.</p>

<p>Next, we tested whether the narrowly specific H173-induced antibodies are similar to CH58 and CH59 mAbs derived from RV144 vaccinees. Since the immunogen used in RV144 trial contains the H173 allele and that the CH58 and CH59 mAbs specifically recognized H173 C β-strand epitope but not the Y173 variant, we hypothesized that the H173 V2, but not the Y173 V2, might induce CH58/59-like antibody responses. This was tested by blocking assays using CH58 and CH59 mAbs. The H173 gp140 Env antigen was coated on ELISA plates and were exposed to H173 or Y173 mice sera after first blocking by treatment with CH58 or CH59 mAbs. Remarkably, the H173 sera, but not the Y173 sera, with or without ΔDSV, showed significant reduction in binding (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6D-E</xref>). Furthermore, since CH58 and CH59 binding is sensitive to mutation at D180 residue that is adjacent to C β-strand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>), we evaluated its binding. Consistent with the above antibody blocking data, binding of H173-induced antibodies but not of Y173-induced antibodies was significantly more sensitive to D180A mutation (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6F-I</xref>). Overall, these data suggest that the presence of histidine at position 173 favors induction of CH58/59-like antibodies with narrow specificity as were elicited by the RV144 vaccinees.</p>
<p>The above datasets show that the mouse H173-induced antibodies, like their human counterparts, are narrowly specific to the autologous C β-strand and hence sensitive to sequence variation. Conversely, the Y173-induced antibodies are broadly reactive, conformation-dependent, and cross-reactive to diverse V2 domains that differ in length, sequence, and glycosylation. Furthermore, these antibodies also tolerated variations in C β-strand sequence not only at 173 position but also at other critical positions such as K168 or K169 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>).</p>

<title>Structural analyses indicate conformational switching in virus escape</title>
<p>To determine if the mutational switch involved in virus escape might be due to a conformational switch in the C β-strand, we performed Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations and structural modeling analyses of H173- and Y173-V1V2 domains. For MD simulations, we first modeled H173- and Y173-V1V2 domains using MODELLER 9v7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>) based on our recently published cryo-EM structure of CRF_AE T/F100 HIV-1 Env trimer as template (PDB ID: 6NQD), due to their extensive sequence similarity (87.6%) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>). Both these V1V2 domains assumed β-stranded conformation matching the template. The V1V2 domains were extracted to run simulations using GROMACS 5.1.2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>) and trajectories were produced for 100 ns with 2fs time step. We then explored how H173 and Y173 strand V1V2 models undergo changes in conformation over time. In H173/Strand but not in Y173/Strand trajectory, helix content increased over time, though the β-pairing within the domain remained stable. In contrast to H173/Strand trajectory, Y173/Strand trajectory displayed a dynamic and fluctuating β-strand content (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7A</xref>, left). We further investigated how the V1V2 conformation would change if the C strand was a helix in the initial conformation. To construct a helix initial model, helical restraints were put on residues, 167-176 (DKKQRVH<bold>/</bold>YALF), following the helical conformation of the published crystal structure of V2/C- strand peptide (PDB ID: 4HPO). The helical structures were also modeled using MODELLER 9v7. Different from the strand conformation simulations, trajectories with helix initial conformations showed unstable trajectories for both H173 and Y173 V1V2 domains. The overall β-strand content increased around 30 ns in both the simulations (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7A</xref>, right). However, while helix in Y173/Helix model was fully unwound during simulation, one turn encompassing residues 166-171 remained in H173/Helix until the end of the trajectory (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7B-C</xref>). Furthermore, the unwound region of H173/Helix but not Y173/Helix model could still engage in β-pairing. Overall, the MD simulations data suggested distinct conformational dynamics for H173 and Y173 V1V2 domains with the latter being relatively more dynamic. Furthermore, while the conserved β-sheet conformation is thermodynamically favored and hence predominates for V1V2 domain, H173/C- strand region could tolerate helical constraint owing to the stable β-pairing in the rest of the domain.</p>

<p>Since the template-based modeling tends to get biased towards the template structure, we next performed structural modeling of H173- and Y173-V1V2 domains using a modelling tool QUARK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>) that generates <italic>ab initio</italic> structure predictions based on physical principles rather than previously resolved structures as templates. Five 3D models depicting possible conformations were generated for each V1V2 variant based on replica-exchange Monte Carlo simulation under the guide of an atomic-level knowledge-based force field. It was found that only one of the five H173-V1V2 models depicted C strand as β-strand, while the rest showed a coil plus a short β- strand or a full coil conformation (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7D</xref>). In contrast, four of the five Y173-V1V2 models depicted C strand in β-stranded conformation while only one model showed this region to assume coil conformation (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7E</xref>). Overall, these models indicate that H173Y mutation causes a structural change in the C β-strand thereby altering the conformational dynamics of the V1V2 domain. Furthermore, notably, models of both the variants depicted the C strand as β-strand to some degree which represent the conserved Greek key motif captured by all the resolved Env trimer structures. However, the degree of β-stranded character was identified to be much higher in Y173 variant than in H173 variant. Hence, it is plausible that the observed antibody evasion and virus escape that occurred in participant 7 was due to a structural transition in this V2 epitope, from helix to β-strand owing to H173Y mutation.</p>

<p>The H173Y mutation leading to structural transition, viral escape, and induction of broadly reactive antibody species provided a conceptual basis to design an ensemble of V2-conformation variants, which could further determine if H173 and Y173 immunotypes can exhibit any effect on the V2 conformation and antibody responses with other V2 mutations. Furthermore, we hypothesized that combinatorial immunogen libraries might further broaden antibody responses which might have implications for vaccine design.</p>
<p>For designing these combinatorial immunogen libraries, first, we sought to identify the potential escape sites in the semi-conserved C β-strand which is previously reported to be conformationally polymorphic and a prime target of V2-directed antibodies. HIV sequence database was explored to extract 100 Env sequences from each of the major geographically prevalent HIV subtypes including A, B, C, and AE. These sequences were individually aligned using CLC Main Workbench and the partly conserved C strand sequence alignment was extracted to generate a consensus logo (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8A</xref>). Subsequently, sites of highest variability were identified in the consensus logogram with the rationale that a less conserved or highly variable site is likely to be linked to viral escape. This resulted in the prediction of four residues-at amino acid positions 166, 169, 170, 171 as highly variable. Then, primers were designed such that the most common variants in the natural HIV-1 population, lysine (K), arginine (R), or glutamine (Q), were incorporated at each of these positions through controlled mutagenesis approach to generate a combinatorial library (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8B</xref>). The resultant library encompassed 54 V2-variants possibly representing the V2 conformations prevalent in the HIV population. The rationale behind choosing naturally selected mutations is not only to represent natural diversity of HIV-1 but to also ensure the structural and functional integrity of the V1V2 domain, thereby presenting only the most relevant epitope diversity to the immune system.</p>

<p>Four different combinatorial gp16-V1V2 nanoscaffold libraries were constructed. Three of these are in the background of H173, Y173, and Y173.ΔDSV templates. The fourth library has a V1 loop deletion as this deletion has previously been shown to modulate the immunogenicity of the Env protein and the subsequent antibody responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>). For this library, we used the Y173 template in which a 15-amino acid residue mutational hotspot in the V1 loop (SNITVERNITIANDTYD) was replaced with a flexible linker (AGGAS) optimized through <italic>in silico</italic> structural modeling such that it will have minimal impact on the V1V2 backbone conformation. This Y173.ΔV1 library is also supposed to eliminate certain immunodominant residues in the V1 loop and enhance V2-directed antibody responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>). These four combinatorial libraries plus the two original H173 and Y173 V2 immunogens as controls, were all expressed as gp16 nanoscaffolds in GnTi cells, and the recombinant proteins were purified. To minimize epitope distraction, a cleavable HRV3c protease site was engineered into each of the constructs and the strep-tags were removed from the purified proteins by treatment with the protease. The protease was then separated from the scaffolds by size-exclusion column chromatography (Fig. S6). The pure, tag-less, V1V2 nanoscaffolds were then used for mouse immunizations and induction of V2- specific antibodies was evaluated.</p>

<title>Combinatorial immunogens broaden V2 antibody responses</title>
<p>BALB/c mice (4 mice/group) were immunized at wks 0, 3, 6, and 9 with pure V2 immunogen libraries as described above (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>). Naïve mice (PBS/no antigen) and mice immunized with gp16-scaffold alone (without V2) served as negative control groups. Sera were collected after the final boost and analyzed by a series of immunological assays.</p>
<p>V1V2-specific antibody titers were quantified by ELISA using the respective purified proteins as coating antigens. V1V2 antibodies were detected after prime immunization and enhanced by several fold with each successive boost for all the groups except for the negative control groups where no V2-specific responses were detected. The terminal bleed sera which had the maximum antibody titers were then used for detailed epitope specificity studies (Fig. S7).</p>
<p>To determine the recognition breadth of antibody responses, a series of ∼20 heterologous recombinant gp140 and gp120 Env proteins from diverse HIV subtypes A, B, AE and C were used as coating antigens for ELISA assays. Many of these were purified from GnTi cells while some were obtained from NIH Reagent Program (Fig S7A-C and Table S1). These Env proteins were selected based on the differences in the composition of the V1V2 domain C β-strand with respect to length and sequence identity, and additionally, glycosylation of their hypervariable V1 and V2 loops (Fig. S8D). All of these recombinant proteins were used as coating antigens to determine the cross-clade antibody responses generated by different combinatorial libraries (Fig. S9).</p>
<p>Consistent with the first mouse study, the Y173-induced antibodies showed greater cross- reactivity than the H173-induced sera, as shown by their binding to majority of the heterologous Env proteins. In contrast, H173-induced sera strongly reacted with Env antigens from A244, 93TH75, 1086 and CM235 strains that contained similar C β-strand sequence as the T/F07 virus, while showing moderate to poor reactivity with the rest of the Env antigens as depicted in the heat map (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8C</xref>). Upon grouping the antigens into T/F07 matched and mis-matched C β-strand sequence, H173 antibody responses were more sensitive to mismatches in the C β-strand region than the Y173 antibodies (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8D</xref>). Cumulative response towards all the antigens was also compared for H173 and Y173 groups by plotting the summarized response based on AUC values (%) (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8E</xref>). These data clearly showed that with single residue change, H173Y, there occurred significant improvement in recognition of diverse Env antigens and hence breadth of V2 reactivity.</p>
<p>The combinatorial H173-induced antibodies, like the H173-induced antibodies, were significantly inhibited by CH58 antibodies while no significant inhibition was observed for sera induced by Y173 or Y173 combinatorial groups (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8F</xref>). These data suggest that both these immunotypes play a dominant role in influencing the conformation even in the context of a library of V2 variants. Furthermore, since CH58 recognizes V2 region as α-helix, it is consistent with our analyses described above that the H173 immunotype has more propensity for helical conformation over β-strand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>).</p>
<p>Finally, unlike the H173 group, the combinatorial H173 group showed relatively broader responses, with much improved binding to Env antigens such as T/F61, T/F94, T/F100, MN and Bal. Hence, H173 library-based vaccine candidates led to enhanced recognition of other Env proteins. With respect to Y173 and Y173.ΔDSV combinatorial libraries, strong binding was seen with all Y173 antigens and moderate reactivity towards H173 bearing antigens. Notably, the sera induced by Y173.ΔV1 combinatorial library showed strong overall binding to both H173 and Y173 antigens. Though the breadth of reactivity for this group was comparable to a non-combinatorial Y173 group, it represented a distinct binding profile because of its stronger reactivity to most of the Env antigens such as A244, T/F100, 96ZM651, and BG505 than the H173Y group containing the V1 loop (as shown in <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig 8C</xref>). Thus, the Y173.ΔV1 combinatorial immunogens containing both the Y173 mutation and V1 loop deletion could be an effective design for broader and stronger cross-reactive V2 antibodies. Overall, this combinatorial approach demonstrates that accommodating putative escape mutations with either histidine or tyrosine at position 173 have differential effect on V2 conformation and antibody responses.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The modest 31.2% efficacy of the only successful RV144 HIV vaccine trial in Thailand was correlated with the induction of V2-directed antibodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>). Analysis of breakthrough infections of vaccinees showed mutations in the V2 domain of the circulating viruses, presumably selected for their ability to survive under the host immune pressure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>). If the vaccine-induced antibody responses had increased breadth, vaccine efficacy would have been greater and it would have also minimized the emergence of viral escape mutants. Hence, increasing the breadth of vaccine-induced antibody responses is a critical goal of HIV-1 vaccine design. Here, we report detailed analyses of a remarkable genetic shift of a transmitted/founder HIV-1 virus through a single amino acid substitution in the V2 domain to escape strong host immune pressure that also resulted in increased breadth and cross-reactivity towards diverse HIV-1 V2 domains and envelope proteins.</p>
<p>Phylogenetic analyses of T/F viruses in longitudinal samples of RV217 ECHO trial identified a complete genetic shift of virus population in participant 7 at 24-wk post-infection. The shifted viruses carried a histidine to tyrosine substitution at position 173 of the semi-conserved C β-strand of the V2 domain. This shift coincided with a wave of H173-epitope specific antibodies produced by the host immune system. That the Y173-epitope showed no detectable reactivity to these antibodies while the H173 epitope reacted strongly demonstrates that the Y173 substitution represents an escape mutant selected in response to the strong immune pressure. Furthermore, the Y173 epitope either did not bind, or bound poorly, to CH58 and CH59 mAbs isolated from RV144 vaccinees, which are also directed to the same C β-strand epitope and recognize H173 as a critical residue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>). In fact, two of the three vaccine immunogens (A244 and 93TH023) used in the RV144 trial had histidine at 173 position, suggesting the H173 specificity of these vaccine induced CH58 and CH59 antibodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>).</p>
<p>Neither the participant 7 T/F sera, nor the RV144 vaccine sera or the CH58 and CH59 mAbs, exhibited strong virus neutralizing activity, but the latter exhibited strong ADCC activity which correlated with reduced infection in immune correlate analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>). Similarly, in our current study, the Y173 escape mutant which also consisted of an additional DSV tripeptide deletion in the adjacent variable V2 loop showed significant resistance to ADCC mediated killing when compared to the H173 epitope. The DSV deletion alone otherwise had no effect on the binding of the C β-strand epitope to antibodies as evaluated by ELISA or SPR binding assays, yet it was co-selected along with the Y173 mutation. This would argue that the strong immune pressure exerted by the host might be due to the ADCC activity of the elicited antibody responses, consistent with the previous reports suggesting the importance of ADCC responses in HIV-1 infected individuals particularly the elite controllers, and the protection imparted by vaccines in non-human primates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>).</p>
<p>Intriguingly, a second wave of antibodies with greater breadth emerged following the H173 to Y173 genetic shift and the essential disappearance of the H173-specific first wave antibodies. Unlike the latter, the second wave antibodies bound equally well to both H173 and Y173 C β-strand epitopes, as analyzed by multiple assays including the sensitive SPR assay. Notably, an examination of Env trimer structures show that the H173 residue is at the center of the C β-strand that contains hydrophilic and solvent-exposed residues flanking on one side and hydrophobic and buried residues on the other side (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>). A H173Y mutation could therefore have significant structural consequences. Previous X-ray structures showed that the H173 peptide epitope assumes an α-helix when bound to CH58 and CH59 antibodies as opposed to a β-strand in the envelope proteins with tyrosine at residue 173 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>). Furthermore, prevalence of either H or Y residues at this position among numerous Env sequences in the database argues for functional importance of this site in HIV-1 evolution. Thus, it appears most likely that the H173Y genetic shift in T/F07 HIV-1 virus may have caused a significant structural/conformational change in the C β-strand epitope, which led to total escape of H173-specific immune pressure while inducing the second wave antibodies with distinct specificity and greater breadth.</p>
<p>Remarkably, the differential immunological responses observed in the human immune system were recapitulated in a mouse model. First, the gp16-V1V2 nanoscaffolds elicited antibody responses in mice that recognized the respective V2 epitopes in the context of gp120 or gp140 envelope protein structures. This is significant not only because antibodies induced by other scaffolded V2 domains do not bind well to the envelope proteins but also that it indicates that the gp16-scaffolded V2 epitopes are displayed in a native-like conformation. Second and more important, the H173 and Y173 variants induced antibodies with distinct specificities, similar to that observed in the human system. While the H173-induced antibodies strongly reacted with the autologous peptides but not with the Y173 peptide, the Y173-induced antibodies exhibited broad reactivity to both the peptides. This differential response was also observed in their reactivity towards diverse HIV-1 Env proteins. While the H173 antibodies were sensitive to mismatches or sequence diversity in the C β-strand, the Y173 antibodies showed cross-reactivity to a variety of Env proteins. Third, the H173 antibodies but not the Y173 antibodies competed with the RV144 CH58 and CH59 mAbs for binding to the C β-strand epitope.</p>
<p>The picture that emerges from the above data, combined with the previously reported studies, is that the C β-strand region is conformationally dynamic and probably undergoes a structural transition when H173 changes to Y, from a β-strand conformation as part of conserved Greek motif to an α-helix/helix-coil conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>). Our MD simulations and <italic>ab initio</italic> structural modeling of H173 and Y173 V1V2 domains further suggest that the H173 region is rigid and assumes a helical/coil conformation whereas the Y173 domain is more dynamic, preferring to be β-stranded and part of a β-sheet core. Thus, it is imperative to include both these structural forms in any vaccine design for increasing the breadth of antibody responses. In fact, a pentavalent vaccine containing five Env proteins including both the H173 and Y173 variants gave better protection in non-human primates when compared to single immunogen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>).</p>
<p>Given the above considerations, we rationalized that for a vaccine to be highly effective, it should not only contain the H173 and Y173 variants, but additionally it should also include commonly found mutations that could fine-tune the C β-strand conformation, some of which might have arisen as escape mutants against host immune pressures in past infections. Furthermore, presenting these variants as gp16 scaffolds would be ideal because this would eliminate nonspecific distraction to other nonessential epitope sites of the Env but also that the gp16-scaffolded V1V2 domains, as discussed above, elicit antibodies that recognize the C β-strand epitopes in a native context. Therefore, a combinatorial immunogen design was developed by including both H173 and Y173 variants, each in addition carrying combinations of the commonly found substitutions in the C β-strand as informed by sequence analyses. These combinations, a total of 54 variant epitopes in each library, in some respects might mimic the natural V2 conformations of HIV-1 viruses humans are exposed to at the site of entry. Assessment of the antibody responses in the mouse model showed that, indeed, some of these libraries significantly enhanced the immune breadth when compared to the respective single immunogen controls. However, consistent with the human responses, the breadth is greater in the context of Y173 when compared to H173, particularly when Y173 was combined with a deletion of V1 loop. The greater breadth and cross-reactive responses resulted from the Y173-ΔV1 library was most likely due to reducing the immunodominance of V1 epitopes as well as generation of breadth favoring conformational variants generated by Y173 switch. Consistent with these data is the recent report that showed that the responses directed to V1 loop interferes with binding of protective V2-directed antibodies to Env and promotes virus acquisition in SIV vaccinated macaques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>). On the other hand, the H173 combinatorial libraries induced antibodies similar to CH58 mAb as shown by the CH58 blocking data. Induction of such responses despite additional mutations in the C β-strand argues for a dominant role the H173 residue plays in assuming a helical conformation that is recognized by the CH58 antibody (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>).</p>
<p>In conclusion, our studies show that residue 173 and the presence of histidine or tyrosine at this position strongly influence the local conformation of V2 domain and this conformational dynamism might lead to virus escape and breakthrough infections. This could potentially be curtailed by combinatorial vaccine designs such as the Y173-ΔV1 library of immunogens that can display a set of dynamic and flexible conformations and have the potential to generate broad antibody responses. This type of escape and conformational variations could also be obtained on a larger scale by AI-based structural modeling and machine learning using the vast HIV sequence database from various clinical trials. These approaches in future could lead to highly effective HIV-1 vaccines with enhanced efficacy and greater ability to block diverse virus transmissions.</p>

The cells were then placed in the shaker incubator for 1 hour at 37°C in 8% CO2, 80% humidified atmosphere. After incubation, DNA (1 µg/ml final transfection volume) was added followed by addition of linear polyethylenimine (PEI25k, Polyscience, Inc.) (1mg/ml) at a 3:1 ratio (PEI:DNA) to the cell suspension. For gp140 expression, cells were co-transfected with furin plasmid DNA to produce cleaved gp120 and gp41 subunits that then associate non-covalently to yield native Env proteins. After 12 h of transfection, HyClone SFM4HEK293 medium (GE Healthcare) supplemented with 1% FBS (v/v) and protein expression enhancing sodium butyrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref>) solution (SIGMA-ALDRICH) to a final concentration of 2 nM were added to the cells to make up to the final volume of transfection. After 5 days of transfection, the supernatant was harvested by centrifuging the cells, and filtered using a 0.2 µm filter (Corning, Inc.).</p>

<title>Protein purification</title>
<p>Secreted twin StrepTagged gp16-V1V2 proteins in the harvested and filtered supernatant were supplemented with BioLock biotin blocking solution (IBA Lifesciences) at 5 µl/ml to mask the biotin present in the supernatant. After 30 min of incubation, the supernatant was loaded onto a 1 ml StrepTactin column (Qiagen) at a flow rate of 0.7 ml/min in the ÄKTA prime-plus liquid chromatography system (GE Healthcare). Non-specifically bound proteins were washed off by passing at least 20 column volumes of the wash buffer (300 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8) or until the absorbance reached the baseline level. Bound gp16-V1V2 proteins were eluted with StrepTactin elution buffer (5 mM d-Desthiobiotin, 300 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Eluted peak fractions were buffer exchanged into 100 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8 buffer. Protein fractions were stored with 10% glycerol at −80°C until use for antigenicity and immunogenicity studies. GnTi expressed His-tagged gp140s and gp120s were purified from the harvested and clarified supernatant using Ni-NTA agarose beads (Qiagen) following manufacturer’s instructions.</p>

<title>StrepTag removal from gp16-V1V2 immunogens</title>
<p>For the second mice immunization study, the Twin-StrepTags were cleaved off the immunogens using HRV3c protease. The recombinant proteins eluted after StrepTactin affinity chromatography, were buffer exchanged with 1X HRV3C protease buffer to remove the desthiobiotin present in the elution buffer. 1 μL of protease was added per 20 μg of the purified protein (1:20) and incubated at 4°C for 16 hours. Digested protein was passed twice through StrepTactin spin column (IBA). Uncleaved StrepTagged protein bound to the column while the flow-through containing desirable cleaved fraction was collected. The cleaved protein was then loaded onto the size-exclusion chromatography column for fractionation using 100 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8 buffer. Owing to a large difference in the native dodecameric gp16-V1V2 (∼336 kD), HRV3C protease (47.8 kD) was separated from the final immunogens. The gp16-V1V2 fractions were pooled, concentrated and stored at −80°C until use.</p>

<title>Biochemical analyses and quantifications</title>
<p>Purified proteins were run on SDS-PAGE to quantify and assess for non-specific protein contamination. SDS-PAGE analyses were performed using 4-20% gradient Tris-glycine gels (Life Technologies) or home-made 12% gels in the presence of DTT (reducing conditions) or absence of DTT (non-reducing). All gels were stained with Coomassie blue R-250 solution. Band intensities were measured using Bio-Rad Gel Doc XR+ System and Image Lab software. BSA standards were used to generate a standard curve for quantification. Deglycosylation was also performed to sharpen the bands for accurate quantitation as HIV Env proteins are glycosylated and hence appear fuzzy on gels. For deglycosylation, 1 µl (500 Units) of PNGase F (New England BioLabs, Inc.) was used to deglycosylate 10 µg of the protein in the presence of 5 mM DTT and mild detergents by incubating at room temperature for 1 hour according to manufacturer’s recommendations.</p>

<title>Western blotting</title>
<p>Proteins separated by SDS-PAGE were transferred to a PVDF membrane using the Trans-Blot® Turbo RTA Mini PVDF Transfer Kit (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc.). Membranes after activating with methanol were blocked with bovine serum albumin (Amresco, LLC). For Strep-Tag II detection, HRP-conjugated StrepMAB-Classical MAb was used at 1:3000 dilution in PBS. Purified mAbs, CH58 and CH59 were used as primary antibodies at 1:5000 dilution in PBS and rabbit anti-human Ab HRP conjugate (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was used as secondary antibodies at 1:10,000 dilution in PBS.

<title>StrepTactin ELISA</title>
<p>StrepTactin ELISA was performed to determine CH58 and CH59 binding to gp16-V1V2 proteins. These specialized plates are pre-coated with StrepTactin to capture strep-tagged antigens. Since the antigen does not directly bind to the plate surface it is maintained in native conformation that improves antibody recognition. To perform this assay, StrepTactin coated microplates (IBA Life Sciences) were coated with 1 µg/ml Strep-tagged proteins in a volume of 100 µl per well of buffer (25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 2 mM EDTA, and 140 mM NaCl) and incubated for 2 h at 4<sup>0</sup>C. Following three washes with PBST (0.05% Tween-20 in 1X PBS), 100 µl of serially diluted Abs (10-0.001 μg/ml) in PBS were added to the wells and the plates were incubated for 1 h at 37°C. After three washes with PBST, the plates were incubated with 100 µl of rabbit anti-human Ab HRP conjugate at 1:3,000 dilution in PBS for 30 min at 37°C. The plates were then washed three times with PBST and the peroxidase substrate was added to develop the color reaction (TMB Microwell Peroxidase Substrate system, KPL). The reaction was terminated by adding 100 µl of BlueSTOP solution (KPL) and OD650 was recorded using VersaMax ELISA Microplate Reader (Molecular Devices).</p>

<p>Antibody blocking assay was conducted by modifying the ELISA protocol. Briefly, 96-well Nunc ELISA plates were coated with 100 ng/well gp140-T/F07 antigen diluted in 1X PBS to a concentration of 1 μg/ml, for overnight at 4°C. After 12 hours, the plates were washed thrice with 1X PBST, followed by blocking with 3% BSA in 1X PBS for 1h at room temperature (RT). Plates were washed thrice with 1X PBST, followed by addition of 100 μL of CH58 or CH59 antibody dilution (1μg/ml) for 1h at 37°C. Wells not preincubated with CH58/CH59 antibodies served as unblocked positive control. The antibodies blocked and unblocked (control) plates were washed three times same as before and incubated with optimized mice sera dilutions (1:2000) from various immunization groups for another 1h at 37°C. After washing three times, the plates were incubated with anti-mouse HRP conjugated secondary antibody for 30 mins at RT. The plates were then washed followed by TMB peroxidase substrate addition (KPL) and read as described above for ELISA.</p>

<title>Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) Binding Assay</title>
<p>Longitudinal plasma samples of RV217_ participant 7 were analyzed by SPR for the presence of V2-specific Abs. SPR measurements were made with a Biacore 4000 system (GE Healthcare, Uppsala, Sweden). The assay was conducted as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>). The subsequent procedure was conducted in a Biacore 4000 system. The immobilizations were completed in 10 mM HEPES and 150 mM NaCl pH 7.4 using a standard amine coupling kit. The CM5-S series chip surface was activated with a 1:1 mixture of 0.4 M 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC) and 0.1 M N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) for 600 seconds. Then 20 µg/mL of each protein diluted in 10 mM sodium acetate pH 4.5 was coupled for six minutes. The immobilized surface was then deactivated by 1.0 M ethanolamine-HCl pH 8.5 for 600 seconds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref>). Spot 3 in each flow cell was left unmodified to serve as reference and to subtract the buffer shifts. After the surface deactivation the immobilized Response Unit densities were recorded for each protein: gp16-T/F07, gp16-H173Y, gp16-ΔDSV, and gp16-H173Y.ΔDSV. Following the surface preparation, the heat inactivated sera from participant 7 were diluted (1:100) in the running buffer (10 mM HEPES, 300 mM NaCl and 0.005% Tween 20). The diluted sera were injected onto the immobilized surface for 250 seconds followed by a 60 second dissociation period. The antibody bound surfaced was then enhanced with 30 µg/ml secondary Sheep Anti-Human IgG (gamma chain) Antibody (Cat#: AU004.X, Binding Site, UK) for 200 seconds. To regenerate the bound surface, 150 mM HCl was injected for 50 seconds, followed by a 60 second buffer injection. All serum samples were conducted with 4 replicates and collected at rate of 10 Hz, with an analysis temperature at 25<sup>∘</sup>C. In addition, monoclonal antibody CH58 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref>) (Cat#: CH58_4A (3453), from Dr, Liao, Duke Human Vaccine Institute), which binds to linear epitope of V2 (AE) was used to monitor the stability of the immobilized gp16 V1V2 surface on the CM5 chip over time. All injections were conducted at flow rate of 10 µl/min. Data analysis was performed using Biacore 4000 Evaluation software 4.1 with double subtractions to the spot 3 (unmodified surface) and the empty buffer. The immobilized scaffold gp16 was compared with unmodified surface, there was no significant of unspecific binding; therefore, unmodified surface (spot 3) was used as reference subtraction.</p>
<p>For evaluating the binding of antibodies present in immunized mice sera with V2-peptides, The subsequent procedure was conducted in a Biacore 4000 system. The immobilizations were completed in 10 mM HEPES and 150 mM NaCl pH 7.4 using a standard amine coupling kit. The CM7-S series chip surface was activated with a 1:1 mixture of 0.4 M 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC) and 0.1 M N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) for 600 s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref>). Then 1 µM Streptavidin in 10 mM sodium acetate pH 4.5 (16,600 – 18,500 RU) was immobilized for 720 s. The immobilized surface was then deactivated by 1.0 M ethanolamine-HCl pH 8.5 for 600 s. Spot 3 in each flow cell was left unmodified to serve as a reference. After the surface deactivation, 25 pM N-linked biotinylated overlapping V2-peptides synthesized by JPT Peptide Technologies GmbH (Berlin, Germany) were captured onto the streptavidin immobilized chips. These overlapping linear peptides were CSFNMTTEIKDKKQRV, IKDKKQRVHALFYKLD, IKDKKQRVYALFYKLD, HALFYKLDIVPIKDNN, IVPIKDNNNDSVEYRLINC and IVPIKDNNNEYRLINC. Following the surface preparation, the heat-inactivated sera were diluted (1:100) in 10 mM Hepes, 150 mM NaCl pH7.4. The diluted sere were injected onto the captured surface for 240 s followed by a 90 s dissociation period. The bound surfaced was then enhanced with a 360 s injection of secondary goat anti-mouse IgG antibody (AffiniPure Goat Anti-Mouse IgG (H+L), Cat#: 115-005-003, Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.). To regenerate the bound surface, 125 - 175 mM HCl was injected for 60 s. Four replicates for each peptide were collected, with an analysis temperature at 25 °C. All sample injections were conducted at flow rate of 10 µl/min. Data analysis was performed using Biacore 4000 Evaluation software 4.1 with double subtractions for unmodified surface and buffer for blank.</p>

<title>GranToxiLux (GTL) antibody dependent cell cytotoxicity (ADCC) assay</title>
<p>ADCC assays were performed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref>). Human CD4+ T lymphoblasts, CEM.NKR, were used as target cells to coat recombinant gp120 proteins. The amount of coating gp120 was optimized through competition by binding of the Leu3A (anti-CD4) antibody (clone SK3; Catalog no. 340133; Final dilution 1:5; BD Bioscience, San Jose, CA, USA). Cryopreserved peripheral blood mononuclear cells, PBMCs from a healthy donor, thawed and rested overnight in R10 media, were used as effector cells (source of effector NK cells). The following day, target cells were coated with titrated amount of T/F07 and its V1V2-mutant gp120s for 75 minutes at 37<sup>0</sup>C. After incubation, coated target cells were mixed with effector cells in 30:1 ratio in 96-well V-bottom plate, followed by addition on granzymeB (GzB). Finally, 4-fold serially dilutions of heat-inactivated plasma samples of RV217 participant-7, from three visits, v0 (pre-infection) for the baseline, and 4-wks (v9) and 24-wks (v14) post-infection or purified antibodies, CH58 and CH65 were added to the respective wells. After 1 hour incubation at 37°C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>, the plate was centrifuged and washed with wash buffer. After washing, the cells were resuspended in wash buffer and the plate was read using the BD LSRII or BD LSRFortessa with the High Throughput Sampler (HTS) with a minimum of 1250 events, to detect the activity of granzyme B (GzB) released by the effector population into target cells. The viable target cells with activated GzB substrate represented the actual population recognized by the effector cells and reported as %GzB activity. The results are reported after background subtraction of the signal acquired from target cells incubated with effector cells in the absence of plasma/antibodies.</p>

<p>Six-week-old female BALB/c mice were received from Jackson’s laboratory for immunization experiments. The immunization was initiated after 2 wks of quarantine. The weights of the mice were taken periodically from the start of the quarantine period to assess growth and health of mice throughout the experiment. 20 μg of the antigen complexed with Alhydrogel 2% (Invivogen) as adjuvant was injected intramuscularly per mouse using a 22-23 gauze needle syringe. Three boosters were given after prime/first immunization at an interval of 3 wks and tail bleeds were performed to collect sera before each immunization. Mice were also bled before the first immunization to collect pre-immunized (pre-bleed) sera for the negative control. Terminal bleed was performed through cardiac puncture under general anesthesia followed by cervical dislocation to euthanize the animals.</p>

<p>This study provides a detailed evaluation of how HIV evades nascent immune pressure from people living with HIV followed nearly immediately after infection. There is <bold>convincing</bold> evidence that H173 mutations in the V2 loop was a key determinant of selection pressure and escape. These data are congruent with protection in the RV144 clinical trial, the only trial that showed protection from infection. Overall, this study is <bold>valuable</bold> to the field.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
This study used a unique acute HIV-1 infection cohort, RV217, to study the evolution of transmitted founder viral Envelope sequences under nascent immune pressure. The striking feature of the RV217 cohort is the ability to detect viremia in the first week of infection, which can be followed at discrete Fiebig stages over long time intervals. This study evaluated Env sequences at 1 week, 4 weeks, and 24 weeks to provide a picture of viral and immunological co-evolution from Fiebig Stage I (1 week), Fiebig Stages IV (4 weeks), and Fiebig Stage VI (&gt;24 weeks). This study design enabled lineage tracing of viral variants from a single transmitted founder (T/F) over the Fiebig Stages I, IV, and VI under nascent immune pressure generated in response to the T/F virus and its subsequent mutants.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
As expected, there were temporal differences in the appearance of virus quasispecies among the individuals, which were located predominantly in solvent-exposed residues of Env, which is consistent with prior literature. Interestingly, two waves of antibody reactivity were observed for variants with mutations in the V2 region that harbors V2i and V2p epitopes correlated with protection in the RV144 clinical trial. Two waves of antibody response, detected by SPR, were observed, with the first wave being predominated by antibodies specific for the T/F07 V2 epitope associated with H173 located on the C β-strand in the V2 region. The second wave was dominated by antibodies specific for an H to Y mutation at 173 that emerged due to antibody-mediated pressure to the original H173 virus. This is a remarkable finding in three ways.</p>
<p>First, the mutation is in the C β-strand, an unlikely paratope contact residue, as this region of the V2 loop is shielded by glycans in Env trimer structures with full glycan representation (see PDB:5t3x). The structure used for modeling in the current study was an earlier structure, PDB:4TVP, that had many truncated glycans. This does not detract from the finding that the H173Y mutation likely causes a conformational shift from a more rigid helical/coil conformation to a more dynamic conformation with a β-stranded and β-sheet core preference as indicated by the literature and by the MD simulations carried out by the authors. This observation suggests that using V2 scaffolds with both the H173 and H173Y variants will increase the breadth of potentially protective antibody responses to HIV-1, as indicated in reference 42, cited by the authors. Interestingly, the H173Y mutation abrogates reactivity to mAb CH58 and attenuates reactivity to mAb CH59 isolated from RV144 volunteers. These mAbs recognize conformationally distinct V2 epitopes, adding further credence to the conclusion that the H173Y mutation results in a conformational switch of the V2 region.</p>
<p>Second, the H173Y mutation affects the conformation of V2 epitopes recognized by mAbs that do not neutralize T/F HIV-1 while mediating potent ADCC. The ADCC data in the manuscript provides strong support for this hypothesis and augers for further exploration of the V2 epitopes as HIV-1 vaccine targets.</p>
<p>
Third, it is striking that immunogens based on the H173Y mutation successfully recapitulated the observed human antibody responses in wild-type Balb/c mice. The investigators used their extensive knowledge of V2 structures and scaffold-immunogens to create the library of constructs used for this study. In this case, the ΔDSV mutation increased the breadth and magnitude of the murine antibody responses.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
1. V2 epitopes exhibit properties of CD4i epitopes in that they are largely absent from the native Env surface, probably by glycan-occlusion, but become more exposed upon CD4 binding. Although the V2-scaffolds were produced in GnTi- cells to produce high-mannose proteins, it appears that no systematic analysis of glycan content or structure was carried out save for enzymatic deglycosylation of the constructs to sharpen bands on SDS-PAGE gels. It would be helpful if the authors could comment on how the lack of this information might impact their conclusions.</p>
<p>2. Similarly, the MD simulations appear to be performed without taking glycan structure/occupancy.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
In this study, researchers aimed to understand how a transmitted/founder (T/F) HIV virus escapes host immune pressure during early infection. They focused on the V1V2 domain of the HIV-1 envelope protein, a key determinant of virus escape. The study involved four participants from the RV217 Early Capture HIV Cohort (ECHO) project, which allowed tracking HIV infection from just days after infection.</p>
<p>The study identified a significant H173Y escape mutation in the V2 domain of a T/F virus from one participant. This mutation, located in the relatively conserved &quot;C&quot; β-strand, was linked to viral escape against host immune pressure. The study further investigated the epitope specificity of antibodies in the participant's plasma, revealing that the H173Y mutation played a crucial role in epitope switching during virus escape. Monoclonal antibodies from the RV144 vaccine trial, CH58, and CH59, showed reduced binding to the V1V2-Y173 escape variant. Additionally, the study examined antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) responses and found resistance to killing in the Y173 mutants. The H173Y mutation was identified as the key variant selected against the host's immune pressure directed at the V2 domain.</p>
<p>The researchers hypothesized that the H173Y mutation caused a structural/conformational change in the C β-strand epitope, leading to viral escape. This was supported by molecular dynamics simulations and structural modeling analyses. They then designed combinatorial V2 immunogen libraries based on natural HIV-1 sequence diversity, aiming to broaden antibody responses. Mouse immunizations with these libraries demonstrated enhanced recognition of diverse Env antigens, suggesting a potential strategy for developing a more effective HIV vaccine.</p>
<p>In summary, the study provides insights into the early evolution of HIV-1 during infection, highlighting the importance of the V1V2 domain and identifying key escape mutations. The findings suggest a novel approach for designing HIV vaccine candidates that consider the diversity of escape mutations to induce broader and more effective immune responses.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
The article presents several strengths:</p>
<p>1. The experimental design is well-structured, involving multiple stages from phylogenetic analyses to mouse model testing, providing a comprehensive approach to studying virus escape mutations.</p>
<p>2. The study utilizes a unique dataset from the RV217 Early Capture HIV Cohort (ECHO) project, allowing for the tracking of HIV infection from the very early stages in the absence of antiretroviral therapy. This provides valuable insights into the evolution of the virus.</p>
<p>3. The use of advanced techniques such as phylogenetic analyses, nanoscaffold technology, controlled mutagenesis, and monoclonal antibody evaluations demonstrates the application of cutting-edge methodologies in the study.</p>
<p>4. The research goes beyond genetic analysis and provides an in-depth characterization of the escape mutation's impact, including structural analyses through Molecular Dynamics simulations, antibody responses, and functional implications for virus survival.</p>

<p>7. The exploration of combinatorial immunogen libraries is a strength, as it offers a novel approach to broaden antibody responses, providing a potential avenue for future vaccine design.</p>
<p>8. The research is highly relevant to vaccine development, as it sheds light on the dynamics of HIV escape mutations and their interaction with the host immune system. This information is crucial for designing effective vaccines that can preemptively interfere with viral acquisition.</p>
<p>9. The study integrates findings from virology, immunology, structural biology, and bioinformatics, showcasing an interdisciplinary approach that enhances the depth and breadth of the research.</p>
<p>10. The article is well-written, with a clear presentation of methods, results, and implications, making it accessible to both specialists and a broader scientific audience.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
While the article presents several strengths, it's important to consider potential weaknesses as well:</p>
<p>1. While the exploration of combinatorial immunogen libraries is innovative, the complexity of this approach may pose challenges in terms of practical implementation, scalability, and cost-effectiveness in large-scale vaccine development.</p>
<p>2. The article will benefit from a more explicit discussion of the limitations and potential drawbacks of the methodologies employed. For example, structural analyses, such as Molecular Dynamics simulations, involve complex computational models. The accuracy and reliability of these simulations may vary, and uncertainties in the interpretation of structural data should be acknowledged.</p>
