<p><italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic> replicates through endodyogeny, an unconventional form of internal budding in which two daughter cells are assembled within a single mother cell. During this process, daughter cells must acquire a full complement of organelles, which may be inherited from the mother, formed <italic>de novo</italic>, or assembled through a combination of both mechanisms. To date the fate of maternal components during replication remains poorly understood. We previously showed that F-actin–driven dynamics generate the intravacuolar network, which defines the residual body (RB) and facilitates recycling of microneme proteins. However, the inheritance and recycling of other organelles have not been systematically analysed.</p>
<p>To address this, we employed a dual HaloTag-based pulse-chase fluorescence labelling strategy to distinguish between <italic>de novo</italic>–synthesized and recycled proteins in replicating tachyzoites. This approach reveals three distinct organelle inheritance patterns: (1) direct transmission of intact maternal organelles (e.g., rhoptries, micronemes), (2) expansion and division of pre-existing maternal organelles with incorporation of newly synthesized components (e.g., Golgi apparatus, apicoplast), and (3) degradation of maternal structures without recycling (e.g., inner membrane complex). Furthermore, we identify Myosin F (MyoF) as the key motor protein that mediates the selective recycling of maternal organelles via the RB. These findings redefine the RB as an active trafficking hub and reveal a selective, regulated system of organelle inheritance and recycling that is critical for intracellular organization and parasite development.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p><italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic> tachyzoites replicate through a specialized form of internal budding known as endodyogeny, wherein two daughter cells (DCs) are assembled within the cytoplasm of the mother cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Francia and Striepen, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Hu et al., 2002</xref>). This unique replication mechanism demands precise orchestration of organelle inheritance and spatial organization within the parasitophorous vacuole (PV). Apicomplexan parasites, including <italic>T. gondii</italic>, exhibit a highly polarized cellular architecture defined by specialized secretory organelles—micronemes, rhoptries, and dense granules—essential for host cell invasion and intracellular survival. These are accompanied by canonical organelles such as the Golgi apparatus, endoplasmic reticulum (ER), a single mitochondrion, and the apicoplast, a non-photosynthetic plastid. Notably, unlike most eukaryotes, <italic>T. gondii</italic> is enveloped by a pellicle consisting of the plasma membrane and an underlying inner membrane complex (IMC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Ouologuem and Roos, 2014</xref>), a structure composed of flattened vesicles tightly associated with the subpellicular cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Harding and Meissner, 2014</xref>).</p>
<p>As DCs emerge during endodyogeny, they progressively encapsulate nearly all maternal cytoplasmic contents. While the sequence of organelle acquisition has been extensively characterized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Nishi et al., 2008</xref>), the extent to which maternal organelles and proteins are recycled remains unclear. We previously showed that maternal micronemal proteins, such as MIC2, are almost entirely recycled into daughter cells via an F-actin–dependent mechanism and are trafficked through the intravacuolar network (IVN), which structurally organizes the residual body (RB) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Periz et al., 2019</xref>). Historically viewed as a passive remnant of maternal cytoplasm, the RB has emerged as a key structure in coordinating replication, facilitating organelle recycling, and maintaining cytoplasmic continuity across individual parasites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Periz et al., 2017b</xref>). The RB forms at the posterior end of dividing parasites, physically linking them through the actin-rich IVN and enabling cytoplasmic exchange and synchronized development within the PV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Periz et al., 2017b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Tosetti et al., 2019</xref>).</p>
<p>Recent studies have shed some light on the molecular architecture and regulation of the IVN. We demonstrated that F-actin filaments organize the IVN, with disruption of actin (ACT1) resulting in parasite disorganization and impaired microneme recycling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Periz et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Periz et al., 2017b</xref>). The RB and IVN also require the function of unconventional myosins MyoI and MyoJ, which are implicated in cell-cell communication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Frenal et al., 2017</xref>). Additionally, the actin-nucleating factors Formin-2 and Formin-3 are required for IVN formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Stortz et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Tosetti et al., 2019</xref>). However, the mechanisms driving the physical transport of maternal organelles remain poorly defined. F-actin could mediate this process either by serving as a track for myosin-dependent vesicular transport, as described for myosin VI in other eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Frank et al., 2004</xref>), or through the intrinsic mobility and dynamic association of actin bundles themselves, which could transiently interact to promote vesicle exchange (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Das et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Khaitlina, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Moore et al., 2021</xref>).</p>
<p>Although the biogenesis of daughter cell structures has been well described, the fate of maternal organelles during replication remains incompletely understood. Evidence suggests that maternal components such as MIC2 and the IMC protein GAP40 can be recycled via actin-dependent mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Ouologuem and Roos, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Periz et al., 2019</xref>). However, a systematic investigation of organelle recycling during endodyogeny has yet to be performed.</p>
<p>In this study, we employ a dual-labeling strategy using the HaloTag system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Urh and Rosenberg, 2012</xref>) to investigate the fate of maternal organelles during <italic>T. gondii</italic> replication. Through fluorescence intensity-based analysis, we identify three distinct fates for maternal proteins: full inheritance of intact organelles, incorporation of newly synthesized components into expanded maternal structures, and degradation without recycling. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the residual body functions as a key recycling hub, with this process dependent on the activity of the class XXII myosin F (MyoF). These findings provide new mechanistic insights into organelle inheritance and reveal how intracellular organization is maintained during parasite replication.</p>

<title>HaloTag-Based pulse chase labelling allows discrimination of recycled and de novo material</title>
<p>To evaluate HaloTag as a tool for distinguishing maternal from newly synthesized proteins during endodyogeny, two marker proteins with known fates were used: MIC2, which undergoes extensive recycling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Periz et al., 2019</xref>), and IMC1, primarily synthesized <italic>de novo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Ouologuem and Roos, 2014</xref>). Using CRISPR/Cas9, endogenous loci were tagged to generate MIC2-Halo and IMC1-Halo strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Singer et al., 2023</xref>).</p>
<p>Both strains were sequentially labeled: maternal proteins were marked with Halo JF646 (M-MIC2, M-IMC1), followed 24 hours later by Halo JF549 to label newly synthesized proteins (n-MIC2, n-IMC1) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). Fluorescence intensity (FI) analysis across replication stages (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B–D</xref>) revealed a progressive decline of M-MIC2 and an increase in n-MIC2, confirming protein recycling. In contrast, M-IMC1 FI dropped from 100% to 14% between stages 1 and 2, with a corresponding rise in n-IMC1 to ∼80%, indicating predominant de novo synthesis. These distinct FI dynamics demonstrate HaloTag’s utility for resolving protein origin and support the <italic>de novo</italic> assembly of the IMC.</p>

<p>Following the same sequential labeling strategy used for MIC2 and IMC1, fluorescence intensity (FI) of maternal proteins was quantified over successive replication cycles (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B, C</xref>). Analysis revealed three distinct inheritance profiles:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p><bold>Group 1:</bold> RON2 and ROP1 exhibited stable maternal FI, with minimal decline of FI within a single rhoptry, indicating recycling of whole organelles. In good agreement with this hypothesis, detailed analysis of M-RON2 inheritance demonstrated that the maternal rhoptries are separated during the distribution and that some daughter cells did not obtain maternal organelles after successive round of replication (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>, <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2</xref>).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><bold>Group 2:</bold> Proteins from diverse organelles (SortLR, ANKER1, TIC20, MyoA) showed a stepwise ∼50% reduction in maternal FI per division, suggesting that recycled, maternal material and <italic>de novo</italic> material end up in the same organelle</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><bold>Group 3:</bold> IMC proteins (IMC1 and GAPM1a) displayed a sharp FI loss between the first and second replication cycles, consistent with predominant <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis of the IMC and degradation of maternal material.</p></list-item>
</list>
Interestingly, MIC2 exhibited intermediate behavior, prompting further analysis to refine its classification. These patterns highlight distinct organelle-specific protein inheritance mechanisms in <italic>T. gondii</italic>.</p>

<title>Micronemes and rhoptries are recycled as intact organelles during Toxoplasma endodyogeny</title>
<p>Micronemes are known to comprise distinct subpopulations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Kremer et al., 2013</xref>), and prior work has shown that recycled and de novo MIC2 localize to separate microneme subsets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Periz et al., 2019</xref>). Based on these observations, we hypothesized that both micronemes and rhoptries are recycled as intact organelles, with new organelles formed independently via <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis.</p>
<p>To test this, we conducted detailed analyses of MIC2 and rhoptry inheritance. As expected, recycled (M-MIC2) and newly synthesized MIC2 (n-MIC2) were largely segregated into distinct micronemes with minimal colocalization (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figure S3</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Periz et al., 2019</xref>). Focusing on sparsely distributed micronemes outside the apical region (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>, boxed area), we measured fluorescence intensity (FI) of individual M-MIC2-positive micronemes at replication stages 2, 4, and 8 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>, zoomed region; 3C). The relatively stable FI of these isolated structures supports whole organelle recycling, consistent with the FI profiles of rhoptries (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B, C</xref>).</p>

<p>Rhoptry analysis further corroborated this model. As with MIC2, M-RON2 and n-RON2 localized to distinct rhoptry populations (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2</xref>), with divergence becoming more apparent at stage 8 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>, <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2D</xref>). M-RON2 FI remained relatively constant through replication (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3 F</xref>), while n-RON2 gradually increased from stage 2 onward (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2C</xref>). Due to their low copy number (8–12 per tachyzoite), maternal rhoptries were separated and often absent in some daughter cells after successive divisions, consistent with stochastic whole-organelle inheritance illustrated by decrease of the M-RON2 fluorescence signal average area and the constancy of the total surface area (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2A, B</xref>). As consequence a progressive decline in M-RON2-positive parasites per vacuole can be observed (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E, D</xref>; <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2D</xref>). In contrast, micronemes showed a more controlled segregation: even in large parasitophorous vacuoles, all daughter parasites retained a mix of recycled and newly synthesized micronemes (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figure S4</xref>), indicating regulated partitioning.</p>
<p>Together, these results demonstrate that both micronemes and rhoptries are recycled as intact organelles. <italic>De novo</italic> organellogenesis acts in parallel to maintain a full complement in each daughter cell, ensuring faithful inheritance during endodyogeny.</p>

<title>Golgi inheritance involves coordinated expansion and partitioning of maternal and de novo proteins</title>
<p>Next, we analyzed SortLR, a Golgi marker, using dual HaloTag labeling. Maternal SortLR (M-SortLR) fluorescence declined by ∼50% per replication round, while newly synthesized SortLR (n-SortLR) increased proportionally, without abrupt loss (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A–B</xref>). This gradual dilution contrasts sharply with the rapid decay seen in Group 3 proteins.</p>

<p>M-SortLR and n-SortLR exhibited strong colocalization across replication stages, and all daughter cells retained M-SortLR (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>). The total Golgi area expanded from ∼2 µm² to ∼10 µm² by stage 8 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>), consistent with coordinated Golgi elongation and medial fission, as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Pelletier et al., 2002</xref>). These results demonstrate that the Golgi undergoes autonomous duplication, incorporating both maternal and <italic>de novo</italic> proteins during its growth and partitioning.</p>
<p>Thus, Group 2 organelles follow a distinct inheritance mode, involving regulated expansion, integration of new material, and equal distribution to progeny—distinct from the whole-organelle recycling of rhoptries/micronemes and the complete turnover seen in IMC proteins.</p>

<title>Maternal IMC proteins are degraded in the RB during replication</title>
<p>Group 3 proteins, typified by IMC components like GAPM1a and IMC1, exhibit a sharply distinct inheritance profile, characterized by rapid loss of maternal fluorescence during replication. Using HaloTag-based dual labeling, we observed a ∼90% reduction in maternal GAPM1a signal by stage 2, with minimal retention through later stages (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A–C</xref>), indicative of active degradation rather than recycling. M-GAPM1a and n-GAPM1a did not colocalize, and residual maternal signal localized transiently at the posterior pole before disappearing entirely, suggesting disposal via the residual body (RB) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>).</p>

<p>Live-cell imaging of IMC1 further supported this model: maternal IMC1 (M-IMC1) condensed at the posterior pole during daughter budding, followed by a marked fluorescence drop, without redistribution to other regions (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E, F</xref> and <xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Figure S5</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="video1">Video S1</xref>). This signal loss was replication-specific, as non-dividing parasites retained stable M-IMC1 levels (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Figure S5D</xref>). Quantification across regions revealed a transient increase at the posterior, followed by complete disappearance, consistent with degradation (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5F</xref>, <xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Figure S5C</xref>).</p>
<p>Interestingly, daughter IMCs (DCs) exhibited brighter fluorescence than the maternal IMC (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Figure S5E, F</xref>), especially during early stages of elongation (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Figure S5 G, H</xref>). FI peaked when DCs reached ∼3 μm in length, suggesting the IMC is fully assembled before emergence and subsequently unfolds without requiring additional material. This preformation explains the absence of maternal IMC recycling. These findings align with earlier observations that IMC components are synthesized de novo during elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Ouologuem and Roos, 2014</xref>).</p>

<title>Distinct recycling pathways govern whole-organelle inheritance of rhoptries and micronemes</title>
<p>Our data suggest that the residual body (RB) plays a selective role in organelle recycling: while microneme and rhoptry proteins are routed through the RB, IMC proteins are primarily degraded within this compartment. In contrast, recycling of maternal Golgi, ER, and apicoplast proteins appears to occur directly, bypassing the RB.</p>
<p>To investigate this further, we performed live-cell imaging of rhoptry and microneme inheritance (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A, B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="video2">Video S2, S3</xref>). MIC2-Halo parasites co-expressing IMC1-YFP, showed that maternal MIC2 (M-MIC2) transits through the RB (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>, white arrows). Notably, after endodyogeny was completed, M-MIC2 was redistributed from the RB to the apical tip of the daughter cells (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>, 11:30, 16:00 h), confirming that the RB serves as a temporary reservoir during microneme recycling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Periz et al., 2019</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>For rhoptries, we examined the inheritance of maternal RON2 (M-RON2) in RON2-Halo parasites co-expressing IMC1-YFP. In approximately 90% of parasites undergoing replication, M-RON2 was integrated into daughter rhoptries prior to mother cell collapse and formation of the RB (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>, 4:15–4:30 h and 10:30–10:45 h). Like M-MIC2, M-RON2 was occasionally detected in the RB, though less prominently, suggesting more rapid or tightly regulated recycling.</p>
<p>To test whether rhoptry recycling also depends on F-actin, as previously reported for micronemes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Periz et al., 2019</xref>), we expressed the F-actin marker Cb-Emerald (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Periz et al., 2017b</xref>) in the RON2-Halo line (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C, D</xref>). While m-MIC2 displayed clear F-actin– associated movement along filaments in the residual body (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>), colocalization of M-RON2 with Cb-Emerald in the residual body was infrequent. On the other hand, both secretory organelles were found to be associated with cytoplasmic F-actin (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D</xref>).</p>
<p>In summary, both rhoptries and micronemes are inherited as intact organelles during <italic>T. gondii</italic> replication. However, the underlying timing differs: microneme recycling is delayed until after daughter emergence, whereas rhoptry inheritance is more direct and occurs prior to mother cell collapse. These findings highlight the organelle-specific complexity of recycling pathways and support whole-organelle recycling of micronemes and rhoptries.</p>
<p>Given the F-actin dependency of this recycling pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Periz et al., 2019</xref>), we hypothesized that a conserved apicomplexan myosin mediates this process. MyoF, a class XXII myosin is conserved across Apicomplexa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Jacot et al., 2013</xref>) and has been implicated in diverse functions—from apicoplast inheritance to F-actin–dependent vesicular transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Carmeille et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Heaslip et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Kellermeier and Heaslip, 2024</xref>).</p>
<p>We endogenously Halo-tagged MIC2, RON2, and SortLR in the auxin-inducible degron line MyoF-mAID (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Carmeille et al., 2021</xref>) and performed dual HaloTag labelling to differentiate maternal (M) from de novo (n) protein pools.</p>
<p>Live imaging revealed that MyoF depletion resulted in the accumulation of maternal but not <italic>de novo</italic> MIC2 and RON2 in the RB during early replication stages (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A, B</xref>). At later stages, recycled <italic>de novo</italic> organelles from earlier cycles (now maternal) also began to accumulate. Immunofluorescence with α-AMA1, α-MIC4, and α-MIC8 confirmed that this phenotype broadly affects the entire repertoire of micronemal proteins (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Figure S6</xref>, <xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">S7</xref>). Quantification showed that approximately 90% of vacuoles exhibited RB accumulation of maternal material upon auxin treatment (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7D</xref>), indicating that MyoF specifically mediates the recycling of maternal micronemes and rhoptries. Interestingly, although our time lapse analysis indicated that rhoptries only rarely traffic via the RB, upon depletion of MyoF, they are accumulating in the RB, supporting the hypothesis that micronemes and rhoptries are transported in the same manner during recycling.</p>

<p>In contrast, Golgi inheritance (marked by SortLR) remained unaffected by MyoF depletion (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7C</xref>).

<p>To confirm that this phenotype results directly from MyoF depletion and not broader disruption of endomembrane architecture, we performed a rescue experiment.

<p>Live-cell imaging confirmed these dynamics (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="video4">Video S4, S5</xref>).

Under auxin treatment, M-MIC2 accumulated post-budding and failed to redistribute (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8E</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="video5">Video S5</xref>). Wash-off rescued redistribution during the second cycle, though visualization required intensity adjustments due to signal differences between accumulated and redistributed pools (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8F</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="video6">Video S6</xref>).</p>
<p>Together, these findings establish that MyoF is essential for recycling maternal micronemes and rhoptries via the RB, redefining the RB as a dynamic trafficking hub, not merely a degradative compartment.

<title>Use of dual labelling to differentiate maternal and de novo material</title>
<p>Understanding the complexity of organelle inheritance in Toxoplasma gondii requires tools capable of resolving both the spatial and temporal dynamics of protein trafficking. Conventional single-labelling approaches have been limited to static snapshots, obscuring key processes such as organelle biogenesis, recycling, and selective degradation. To overcome these challenges, we employed a dual HaloTag pulse-chase labelling strategy to distinguish maternally inherited from de novo–synthesized proteins. This approach, previously underutilized in apicomplexan parasites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Koreny et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Periz et al., 2019</xref>), allowed us to resolve protein fates across replication cycles and map distinct inheritance routes for multiple organelles.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s3b">
<title>The residual body as a regulatory hub</title>
<p>Our findings reaffirm the emerging view of the RB as an active, multifunctional structure rather than a passive cytoplasmic remnant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Frenal et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Periz et al., 2017a</xref>). First described over 50 years ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Sheffield and Melton, 1968</xref>), the RB was long believed to serve as a repository for discarded material, often called a “waste bin” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Nishi et al., 2008</xref>). However, we show that the RB temporarily stores maternal secretory organelles, such as micronemes and rhoptries, which are later redistributed to daughter cells in a MyoF-dependent manner.</p>
<p>Live-cell imaging revealed that organelles in the RB are not static but can re-enter functional pathways (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figures 8–10</xref>), establishing the RB as a trafficking checkpoint (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Periz et al., 2019</xref>). This active role is further supported by the dependence of RB-mediated recycling on F-actin and the class XXII myosin MyoF, which we show to be essential for retrieval of maternal MIC2 and RON2 but dispensable for Golgi inheritance although we noticed a fragmentation of the Golgi, which has been described to depend on MyoF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Carmeille et al., 2021</xref>).</p>
<p>The RB is also critical for cytoplasmic continuity across parasites, synchronizing replication and facilitating inter-parasite protein exchange (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Frenal et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Muniz-Hernandez et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Periz et al., 2017a</xref>). Its formation is dependent on actin-nucleating factors and myosins, indicating a complex and regulated origin rather than a passive leftover of cytokinesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Stortz et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Tosetti et al., 2019</xref>). Given these parallels, the RB may be functionally analogous to the mammalian midbody remnant, which regulates post-mitotic signaling and intracellular trafficking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Kuriyama et al., 2025</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Peterman and Prekeris, 2019</xref>).</p>

<sec id="s3c">
<title>Fate determination: inheritance or degradation?</title>
<p>An important question raised by our study is how the parasite determines whether maternal proteins are recycled or degraded. Our results indicate that this decision is selective rather than stochastic (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9</xref>). For instance, maternal micronemes persist for at least six replication cycles in the absence of MyoF, without signs of degradation. In contrast, IMC proteins like GAPM1a and IMC1 are lost within a single cycle and show no evidence of recycling. Degradation appears to occur within the RB itself, raising questions about the underlying mechanism. Although <italic>T. gondii</italic> encodes homologs of lysosomal and autophagic degradation machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Besteiro et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Smith et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Thaprawat et al., 2025</xref>), none have been localized to the RB or directly linked to IMC degradation. However, ubiquitin ligases and proteasomal components have been identified in the RB proteome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">O’Shaughnessy et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Que et al., 2002</xref>). IMC proteins are also part of the ubiquitinated proteome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Silmon de Monerri et al., 2015</xref>), and recent work showed that deletion of the kinase ERK7 prevents sequestration of the E3 ligase CSAR1, resulting in aberrant degradation of conoids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">O’Shaughnessy et al., 2023</xref>). These findings support a model in which protein fate within the RB is determined through selective ubiquitination and regulated proteolysis.</p>

<title>A call to reassess recycling factors in Toxoplasma gondii</title>
<p>The recognition of the residual body (RB) as a key site for organelle recycling has fundamentally revised our understanding of intracellular trafficking in <italic>T. gondii</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Periz et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Tosetti et al., 2019</xref>). Earlier models emphasized <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis of organelles and proposed a repurposing of classical endocytic machinery for secretory functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Tomavo, 2014</xref>). However, our HaloTag-based pulse-chase studies show that secretory organelles such as micronemes and rhoptries are extensively recycled via the RB, in a process dependent on F-actin and the unconventional myosin MyoF.</p>
<p>This shift in our understanding calls for a systematic re-evaluation of trafficking factors traditionally implicated in protein targeting, vesicle transport, and organelle biogenesis. Many of these particularly Rab-GTPases, SNAREs, and dynamins were previously studied without consideration of recycling pathways. Notably, accumulation of microneme material in the RB has been observed upon perturbation of several trafficking regulators, including Rab5A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Kremer et al., 2013</xref>), ArlX3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Klinger et al., 2024</xref>), SORTLR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Sloves et al., 2012</xref>), VPS8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Morlon-Guyot et al., 2018</xref>), and VPS11 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Morlon-Guyot et al., 2015</xref>). Yet, whether these phenotypes reflect a block in secretion, synthesis, or recycling remains unclear.</p>
<p>To resolve this, a targeted reanalysis of trafficking factors using our dual-labelling HaloTag assay combined with the splitCas9 system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Li et al., 2022</xref>) would allow high-throughput functional screening to specifically distinguish defects in recycling from those in de novo biogenesis, offering a path to redefine the roles of classical and lineage-specific trafficking regulators in <italic>T. gondii</italic>.</p>

<p>To assess the distribution of maternal micronemes at stage 8, parasites were labeled as described in “Maternal and de novo protein discrimination.” Twenty-five stage 8 vacuoles were selected. Using the de novo MIC2 signal, the outline of each tachyzoite was traced, and the number of maternal MIC2-positive parasites was counted. Tachyzoites were numbered 1 to 8 from left to right. Three biological replicates were performed. Data are reported as mean ± SD. Images were analyzed in Fiji.</p>

<title>Induction of MyoF KD</title>
<p>MyoF-mAID parasites were genetically modified to endogenously tag MIC2, RON2 and SortLR. As previously described for MyoF mAID parasites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Carmeille et al., 2021</xref>), MyoF-mAID MIC2/RON2 or SortLR-Halo parasites were induced +/- auxin for 4h prior to labelling and experiments.</p>

<title>Quantification of the accumulation of protein in the residual body</title>
<p>Parasites were treated ± auxin for 4 h and labeled as described above. After 24 h replication on live-cell dishes, ∼100 vacuoles were imaged across ∼15 fields of view. The percentage of vacuoles showing accumulation of material in the residual body was calculated. The experiment was performed with three independent biological triplicates. The values are then expressed as the mean values of the three independent experiments ± SD. Images were analysed via Fiji.</p>

<title>Auxin chased experiment</title>
<p>Parasites were induced +/- auxin for 4h prior labelling as describe above in “Maternal and de-novo protein discrimination”. After transfer on live cell dish and 48 h of replication +/- auxin, the parasites were images. For the chased condition, the parasites were grown for 24h under auxin. After this initial 24h, the dishes were washed three time to completely remove the auxin, a fresh media (without auxin) was added. Parasites were then allowed to replication for an extra 24h. About 15 fields of view were images for a total of about 100 vacuoles. The percentage of vacuole with accumulation in the residual body was calculated. Some parasites were exhibiting a redistribution where the microneme were no longer stuck in the residual body but not as homogeneously distributed as control parasite microneme. This profile was name “redistributed” and quantified along with the “accumulated” and “normal” patterns. The experiment was performed with three independent biological triplicates. The values are then expressed as the mean values of the three independent experiments ± SD. Images were analysed via Fiji.</p>

<title>MyoF-mAID Live replication assay</title>
<p>Parasites were induced +/- auxin for 4h prior labelling. Parasites were labelled with the Halo membrane permeable dye Halo 646 (Janelia Fluor®646 1:1000 Promega) for 1 h and washed three-time prior transfer onto a live cell dish covered with HFF. Parasites were allowed to invade for 1h-2h to obtain enough invasion events to reach an average of 10 parasites per FOV. After the invasion, the excess of parasites was removed by 3 washes. A new membrane permeable dye Halo 549 (Janelia Fluor®549 1:10000 Promega) was added to the media to record the de-novo generation of the POI live. Live cell dishes were then transferred to the Leica-DMI8, heated at 37°C under a chamber containing 5% CO2. Laser power and exposure were adjusted to the lowest values allowing reliable imaging. Imaged were taken every 15-30 minutes to follow the tagged protein behaviour during replication for 12h. For the Chased assay, the imaging started after the removal of the auxin after 24h of replication as described above in “Auxin chased experiment.” <bold>_</bold>The experiments were performed with three independent biological triplicates.

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This work asks the question of how different organelles and structures in the apicomplexan parasite Toxoplasma gondii are recycled and/or segregated to the daughter cells during cell replication. In particular, they consider an unusual cell structure called the residual body that links replicating cells during the intracellular infection stage of this parasite. The residual body has historically been considered a 'dumping ground' for unnecessary relics of the mother cell during division, but this notion is increasingly being revised. Indeed, cell replication in Toxoplasma is often misinterpreted as cell division (cytokinesis), but in fact, the cell replicates its organelles and structures to multiple 10s of copies in seemingly distinctly formed daughter cells, but cytokinesis is delayed for many such cycles and typically only occurs simultaneously with parasite egress from its host cell. The residual body is, in fact, the connection between these pre-cytokinetic replicated daughters, and effectively, this is still a single cell at this stage. The authors have previously shown that an actin network extends through the residual body between these daughter cells, and ER and mitochondria common to all cells are also linked through this structure. This study examining the fates of organelles during cell replication is timely for continuing our understanding of how this fascinating component of the cell participates in these processes. The authors use Halo-tags as their principal tool to track discrete populations of proteins, labelling their organelle locations, and this provides beautiful insight into these processes.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Using dyes conjugated to Halo tags, this work elegantly tracks the fates of proteins synthesised by an original 'mother' cell over several replication cycles of pre-cytokinetic 'daughters'. Using this tool, they show that some organelles are made intact just once and that some of these can be subsequently sorted to the daughters (micronemes and rhoptries) while others are dismantled (IMC) and the daughters must make their own. A third set of organelles (largely synthesis, sorting, and metabolic compartments) is divided and inherited, and new daughter-synthesised proteins are added to the preexisting maternal proteins in these structures. A role for actin and myosin is clearly demonstrated for micronemes and rhoptries, and this correlates with their relatively late inheritance into the developing daughters. Overall, this work gives clarity to the behaviours of several cell structures during replication and paves the way to a better understanding of the mechanisms that drive the differences between structures and the universality of these processes in other apicomplexan parasites.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>In addressing the question of residual body participation in sorting of organelles, it would be useful to clearly define this structure and when and where it is delineated from the posterior of a mother cell during the formation of daughter structures. This might seem like a moot point, but it would give clarity to notions of recycling and 'reservoirs'. Mother cells retain their active invasion apparatus until very late in daughter formation, and the need for micronemes and rhoptries to be released from this service late in the process might explain why they are only then trafficked to the cell posterior and then into the daughters. So, is this a distinct 'residual body' body function/reservoir or just a spatial constraint of this sequence of daughter formation? In subsequent cell replications (4, 8, 16... stages), is there a separation between the residual body that links them all and the posterior of each new 'mother cell', and if so, when is this distinction lost? This is important because without a definition, we might be confusing different processes. Are rhoptries/micronemes that originate in one 'mother' able to be sorted to the 'daughters' from a distinct mother in this syncytium? If so, this would make it a sorting centre, but otherwise we could be just capturing the activities at the posterior of any given cell during replication. The authors' further thoughts on this would be very interesting.</p>
<p>The Group 2 structures are described as those that are divided between daughters and receive newly synthesised proteins that add to the maternal protein of these compartments. While this is a logical conclusion for several that are mentioned, where the maternal protein signal is seen to be depleted with replication (including for the apicoplast, ER, glideosome, and Golgi). Data for the addition of new proteins to these existing structures is actually only presented in direct support of this for the Golgi.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Toxoplasma gondii is an obligate intracellular parasite and the causative agent of Toxoplasmosis. Parasite invasion into host cells, intracellular replication, and then egress, which results in the destruction of the infected cell, is central to pathogenicity. This manuscript focuses on understanding how maternal resources (in this case, cellular organelles) are shared between daughter parasites during cell division. Many organelles are single copy, meaning that division and inheritance by the daughters is crucial for successful replication. The major strength of this study was the use of a Halo-based pulse chase assay to characterize patterns of organelle inheritance. The results show that both microneme and rhoptries (secretory vesicles) previously thought to be synthesized de novo are inherited by daughter parasites. Thus, this paper adds new insight to our understanding of cell division in this important parasite.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This study demonstrated that pulse labeling of proteins can be used to monitor protein synthesis, turnover, and movement. This approach will be of great interest to the field. Using this method, the authors demonstrate three main modes of organelle inheritance.</p>
<p>(1) Organelles, where there are multiple copies (such as secretory vesicles, micronemes, and rhoptries), are divided between the daughter parasites, with additional contribution of newly formed vesicles. New and old material remain as separate entities in the cell.</p>
<p>(2) Single-copy organelles, which are expanded to include newly synthesized material prior to division, such as the Golgi and apicoplast.</p>
<p>(3) Cytoskeletal structures that are synthesized anew during each round of division. These studies provide more refined insight into patterns or organelle inheritance and demonstrate that secretory organelles are not made de novo during each round of division as previously thought. The paper has a logical flow, and overall, the data is presented in a clear and organized fashion.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) Descriptions of methodology and statistical analysis were incomplete.</p>
<p>(2) There are inconsistencies between the data in Figures 1 and 5. In Figure 1, a small amount of maternal IMC is visible in stage 2 parasites. Although this is a ~90% reduction, these parasites should be quantified as parasites with material IMC. However, the graph in Figure 5C indicates that no material parasites have GAPM1a, given that graph 5C is a binary measure (present vs. absent), one would expect a non-zero percent of parasites to have maternal material.</p>
<p>(3) The conclusion from Figure 6 was not justified based on the data. I agree with the author's conclusion that the accumulation of micronemes and rhoptries in the residual body was time-dependent. In Figure 6A, the signal observed in the residual body at times 6:30, 13, and 14 hours is not observed in subsequent time points. However, the fate of these micronemes and rhoptries is unclear. It cannot be concluded that these vesicles are recycled back to the mother. They could also have been degraded. In fact, the graphs of microneme inheritance in Figure 2B show a decrease in maternal signal from 100% to 80% between stages 1 and 2, indicating that some microneme degradation is taking place.</p>
<p>(4) To convincingly demonstrate that the redistribution of micronemes and rhoptries was due to recovery of MyoF protein levels after auxin washout, a Western blot should be performed to show MyoF protein levels over time. In addition, the decrease in mMIC2 protein levels in the residual body in Figure 8F should be measured and normalized for photobleaching. Both apical and basal signals appear to be reduced over the time course of imaging.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Knoerzer-Suckow et al. explore the mechanisms of organelle inheritance during endodyogeny in Toxoplasma gondii using an innovative dual-labeling approach to track the distribution of maternal organelles into daughter parasites. They can clearly distinguish between maternal and daughter-derived organelles using their dual-labeling Halo Tag approach. They reveal that different organelles are trafficked to daughter parasites in three broad patterns, which they have binned into groups. Their findings reveal a role for MyoF in the inheritance of micronemes and rhoptries, and notably, they observe that the inner membrane complex (IMC) is not recycled. Instead, the IMC undergoes a pronounced relocalization to the posterior of the maternal cell, where it is likely targeted for degradation.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The data surrounding their MyoF knockdown experiments, IMC degradation, and trafficking of MIC2 after auxin washout are compelling. These data add to the knowledge of how organelle inheritance occurs in T. gondii, increasing the field's understanding of endodyogeny.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) The evidence provided to support the claim that microneme and rhoptry inheritance specifically traffics through the residual body does not sufficiently substantiate the claim. The temporal resolution of the imaging is inadequate to precisely trace the path of microneme and rhoptry inheritance. From the data shown in the manuscript, it can be concluded that at least some of the micronemes and rhoptries might be recycled through the residual body, but it is unclear whether many or most of these organelles do so.</p>
<p>(2) The absence of specific markers for the residual body brings into question whether microneme inheritance occurs through a discrete residual body or simply via the basal end of the maternal parasite. The authors need a robust way to visualize and define the residual body to claim that micronemes and rhoptries are specifically transported through this structure.</p>
