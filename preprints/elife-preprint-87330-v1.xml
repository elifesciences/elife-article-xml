<title>Abstract</title>
<p>The <italic>Hydra</italic> nervous system is the paradigm of a “simple nerve net”. Nerve cells in <italic>Hydra</italic>, as in many cnidarian polyps, are organized in a nerve net extending throughout the body column. This nerve net is required for control of spontaneous behavior: elimination of nerve cells leads to polyps that do not move and are incapable of capturing and ingesting prey (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Campbell, 1976</xref>). We have re-examined the structure of the <italic>Hydra</italic> nerve net by immunostaining fixed polyps with a novel pan-neuronal antibody that stains all nerve cells. Confocal imaging shows that there are two distinct nerve nets, one in the ectoderm and one in the endoderm, with the unexpected absence of nerve cells in the endoderm of the tentacles. The nerve nets in the ectoderm and endoderm do not contact each other. High-resolution images show that the nerve nets consist of bundles of parallel overlapping neurites. Transmission and serial block face scanning electron microscopy show that nerve bundles in the ectoderm are closely associated with ectodermal muscle processes. Nerve bundles in the endoderm are separate from muscle processes. The occurrence of bundles of neurites supports a model for continuous growth and differentiation of the nerve net by lateral addition of new nerve cells to the existing net. This model was confirmed by tracking newly differentiated nerve cells.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Nerve cells arose early in the evolution of multicellular animals to sense the environment and control the activity of downstream effector cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Anderson, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Mackie, 1990</xref>). In non-bilaterians (cnidarians and ctenophores) nerve cells are organized in nerve nets, which are often associated with muscle processes and coordinate the behaviors that involve ectodermal and endodermal tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Mackie, 1990</xref>). In bilaterian metazoans, the number of nerve cells is commonly much higher than in cnidarians and ctenophores and - importantly - nerves are organized into a centralized nervous system with large ganglia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Arendt et al., 2016</xref>). The relatively simple organization of nervous tissue in non-bilaterians offers the possibility of achieving a comprehensive understanding of the relationship between the architecture and activity of the nervous system and animal behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Bosch et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Galliot et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Watanabe et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>With a nervous system consisting of only 500-2000 nerve cells, depending on animal size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Bode et al., 1973</xref>), the freshwater polyp <italic>Hydra</italic> is a particularly useful model organism for such investigations. Furthermore, there are only two types of nerve cells based on morphology: ganglion cells and sensory cells, and there are no surrounding support cells, such as glia cells in bilaterians (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">David, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Epp and Tardent, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Westfall, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Westfall and Epp, 1985</xref>). Ganglion cells are bipolar or multipolar, but there is no evidence for a distinction between axons and dendrites. Sensory nerve cells, by comparison, are polarized, with a short neurite and sensory cilium at one pole and a longer neurite at the opposite pole. Sensory cells in the ectoderm extend a cilium to the surface of the epithelium to sense the external environment. Sensory cells in the endoderm extend a cilium into the gastric cavity. Recent scRNAseq results have refined these morphological classes to include 3 sensory and 5 ganglion nerve cell populations based on distinct transcriptomes (Cazet et al., 2022; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Siebert et al., 2019</xref>).</p>
<p>Nerve cells in <italic>Hydra</italic> are organized in a nerve net, as first described in classic studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Schneider, 1890</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Hadži, 1909</xref>), in which the nerves were visualized by methylene blue staining and tissue maceration. Although higher concentrations of nerve cells were found in the head and the foot, there was no evidence for ganglia or a “brain”. A more detailed description of the organization and formation of distinct subpopulations of nerve cells in the various body parts of <italic>Hydra</italic> polyps was achieved by using monoclonal antibodies that recognized unknown antigens and antibodies that recognized neuropeptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Dunne et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Grimmelikhuijzen, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Grimmelikhuijzen et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Hobmayer et al., 1990a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Hobmayer et al., 1990b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Technau and Holstein, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Yaross et al., 1986</xref>). More recently, the use of in situ hybridization to detect the expression of neuropeptide genes and transgenic reporter lines have provided more understanding of the regionalization of the peptidergic part of <italic>Hydra’s</italic> nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Hansen et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Grimmelikhuijzen et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Koizumi et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Noro et al., 2019</xref>). However, all of these results lacked the resolution to describe the entire nerve net in detail and there is presently no clear understanding of how nerve cells are organized in the nerve net or how they communicate with each other. Likewise, while extensive EM studies have provided high-resolution images of individual nerve cells, neurites, and synapses (Kinnamon and, 1981; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Kinnamon and Westfall, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Westfall, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Westfall et al., 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Westfall et al., 1983</xref>), they could not reveal the overall organization of the nerve net.</p>
<p>The <italic>Hydra</italic> nerve net is unique in that it grows continuously. All <italic>Hydra</italic> tissues, including the nerve net, are newly formed every 2-3 weeks in well-fed animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Campbell, 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">David and Campbell, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">David and Gierer, 1974</xref>). Since cell proliferation occurs exclusively in the body column, there is continuous displacement of cells from the body column toward the head and foot and loss of cells at the extremities. In the course of this growth and displacement, the nerve net expands by the addition of nerve cells, which arise by differentiation from interstitial stem cells in the body column. Head- and foot-specific nerve cells are also continually added to these differentiated tissues. For example, tentacle tissue is completely renewed in 4-5 days by displacement of epithelial tissue from the body column into the tentacles. Ectodermal epithelial cells at the base of a tentacle differentiate into battery cells with the incorporation of nematocytes and newly differentiated sensory nerve cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Hobmayer et al., 1990b</xref>).</p>
<p>In the present experiments, we take advantage of a newly developed pan-neuronal antibody, which stains all nerve cells and nerve processes in fixed <italic>Hydra</italic> polyps. The antibody was made against a peptide sequence in the intracellular domain of the <italic>Hydra</italic> classic cadherin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Cramer von Laue, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Chapman et al., 2010</xref>; GenBank accession number XP_012558722) and represents an important new tool for studying the <italic>Hydra</italic> nervous system. Antibody staining and confocal microscopy show that nerve cells in <italic>Hydra</italic> are organized as two separate nerve nets, one in the ectoderm and one in the endoderm. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and block face scanning electron microscopy demonstrate that the two nerve nets consist of bundles of overlapping nerve cell processes. Strikingly, these neurite bundles extend past nerve cell bodies and do not appear to terminate on them. These results suggest a novel model for growth of the nerve net based on the lateral addition of new nerve cells to the existing net. We confirmed this model by tracking the addition of newly differentiated nerve cells to the nerve net.</p>

<title>A new peptide antibody stains the entire nerve net in <italic>Hydra</italic></title>
<p>A rabbit antibody made against a peptide sequence in the cytoplasmic domain of <italic>Hydra</italic> cadherin (see Materials and Methods) stains the nerve net in <italic>Hydra</italic> and is referred to here as hyCADab (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figs. 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>). In order to determine whether the hyCADab recognizes all nerve cells in <italic>Hydra</italic>, two sets of experiments were performed. First, we determined the ratio of antibody-stained nerve cells to epithelial cells in confocal image stacks taken through the body wall in the middle of the animal and compared it to the ratio determined by maceration of the same tissue (see Materials and Methods). Both measurements yielded a ratio of 0.12 nerve cells/epithelial cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS2">Suppl Fig 2C</xref>). Second, we studied two transgenic lines, which express GFP in nerve cells (nGreen and Hym176B, see Materials and Methods). Fixed polyps of both strains were stained with the hyCADab and transgenic GFP-expressing nerve cells were scored for hyCADab staining. In the Hym176B strain 149/149 transgenic nerve cells were stained with hyCADab. In the nGreen strain 51/51 transgenic nerve cells were stained with hyCADab. Together with the results of cell counting we conclude that hyCADab stains all nerve cells in <italic>Hydra</italic>.</p>

<title>Imaging the <italic>Hydra</italic> nerve net with hyCADab</title>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> shows a low magnification confocal image of the upper body column of <italic>Hydra</italic> stained with hyCADab, including the hypostome and tentacles. The image shows primarily the ectodermal nerve net; endodermal nerve cells lie below the focal plane. The antibody stains both nerve cell bodies and nerve cell processes, which are oriented parallel to the oral-aboral axis of the body column and also extend into the tentacles. The hypostome forms a dome above the tentacle ring and includes nerve cells oriented toward the mouth opening in the center of the hypostome. Confocal images of inverse watermelon polyps in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">Suppl Fig 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">B</xref> show the tissue structure in which the nerve net is embedded.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> shows a confocal image of the lower half of a body column. Ectodermal nerve processes are oriented along the oral-aboral axis but become less oriented in the peduncle. There is an increase in nerve cell numbers in a band just above the basal disk.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> shows a ring cut from the body column in the mid-gastric region. The view is down the oral-aboral axis and the position of the mesoglea is shown as a green line for orientation (see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">Suppl Fig 1C</xref>). The ectodermal nerve net consists of ganglion cells oriented along the oral-aboral axis and hence cut in cross section. The endodermal nerve net consists of roughly equal numbers of sensory cells and ganglion cells. The ganglion cells form a network near the base of endodermal cells whereas the sensory cells extend prominently up through the endodermal layer into the gastric cavity. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">D</xref> show images from a single confocal stack taken through the body wall in the gastric region. Nerve cells in the ectoderm form an array of parallel processes oriented along the oral-aboral axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig 2C</xref>); those in the endoderm form a roughly polygonal array (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig 2D</xref>). Both nerve cell bodies and nerve cell processes stain with the hyCADab. The nerve cell bodies are roughly 10 μm long; the distance between nerve cell bodies is variable in both ectoderm and endoderm but usually 50-100 μm. While cell bodies and processes in the ectoderm are organized in a plane, which includes the muscle processes of the ectodermal cells, those in the endoderm are not closely associated with endodermal muscle processes (see below). Endodermal sensory cells extend deeper into the tissue (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig 2B</xref>) and are not included in the image.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> shows higher magnification images of the hypostome, a tentacle, and the peduncle/basal disk, all of which reveal a distinct and specific neuronal pattern with a higher density of nerve cells. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig 3B</xref> is a surface view of the hypostome showing a dense network of ganglion cells with nerve processes extending down the body column. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig 3C</xref> shows a section deeper in the hypostome roughly passing through the mouth opening. Sensory cells are prominent in the ectoderm near the mouth and extend to the outer surface of the tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">C</xref>, red arrows). When viewed from above, these sensory nerve cells form a ring around the mouth opening (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig 3D</xref> red arrows). Sensory cells in the endoderm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig 3C</xref>, yellow arrows) lie between the dense mass of mucous cells and endodermal epithelial cells, which make up the endodermal layer of the hypostome (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">Suppl Fig 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">B</xref>). They are connected to a network of ganglion cells in the endoderm under the mesoglea.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig 3E</xref> shows a surface view of a portion of an extended tentacle. Nerve cells form a roughly polygonal pattern associated with the battery cells, which form the ectoderm in tentacles.

<title>The nerve nets in the ectoderm and endoderm are separate structures and are differently associated with muscle processes</title>
<p>While the images in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref> describe the complete nerve net, they do not permit localization of nerve cells or portions of the nerve net clearly to the ectoderm or the endoderm. To resolve this question, we used transgenic lines expressing Lifeact-GFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Aufschnaiter et al., 2017</xref>), which binds specifically to filamentous actin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Riedl et al., 2008</xref>). Since most filamentous actin is concentrated in the muscle processes at the base of epithelial cells, these structures are brightly fluorescent in confocal images. The muscle processes are localized at the base of epithelial cells directly apposed to the mesoglea. Thus, they precisely mark the boundary between ectoderm and mesoglea and between endoderm and mesoglea.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> shows shows segments of rings of body column tissue (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig 2A</xref>) cut from an ectodermal Lifeact animal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig 4A</xref>) and from an endodermal Lifeact animal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig 4B</xref>). In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig 4A</xref> the green spots represent muscle fibers in the ectoderm, which run parallel to the oral-aboral axis of <italic>Hydra</italic>, and were cut when the ring was excised from the body column. The irregular red dots in between muscle fibers in the ectoderm are nerve cell processes. They are typically closely associated with muscle processes in the ectoderm. Underneath the ectodermal muscle processes there is a black space representing the mesoglea, which separates the ectoderm from the endoderm. Red hyCADab stained nerve cell bodies and neurites are also present in the endoderm.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> shows the opposite situation in an endodermal Lifeact animal. Muscle processes at the base of endodermal epithelial cells are oriented circumferentially around the body column and mark the endodermal side of the mesoglea. An endodermal ganglion cell is stained by hyCADab and neurites from this cell extend parallel to but are separated from the muscle fibers. Thus there is a clear difference in the way the ectodermal and endodermal nerve nets are associated with muscle processes. The diagram in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig 4C</xref> shows this schematically. The localization of ectodermal ganglion cells completely overlaps the localization of ectodermal muscle processes. By contrast the localization of endodermal ganglion cells is largely separated from endodermal muscle processes.</p>
<p>Importantly, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4B</xref> there are no connections between nerve cells in the ectoderm and nerve cells in the endoderm. To search more extensively for nerve cell contacts between the ectoderm and endoderm, we imaged complete rings of body column tissue (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig 2A</xref>) from 4 different hyCADab stained Lifeact polyps. These rings contained a total of 133 nerve cells (57 ectoderm, 76 endoderm) and associated neurites and represented about 4% of body column tissue. No contacts between the ectodermal and endodermal nerve nets were observed. We have taken many more image stacks at different positions in the body column, peduncle, and hypostome and never found a connection between the ectodermal and endodermal nerve nets.</p>

<p>The absence of neurons in the tentacle endoderm indicates a massive loss of endodermal nerve cells at the transition from the upper body column to the tentacles. We suggest that this loss of endodermal neurons is related to the formation of battery cells in the ectoderm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Hobmayer et al., 1990b</xref>) and reflects a remodeling of both the ectoderm and endoderm during tentacle formation.</p>

<title>Nerve cell numbers in the ectoderm and endoderm along the body column</title>
<p>Images of the nerve net in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref> show only small differences in the apparent density of nerve cells along the body column. To put this qualitative observation on a quantitative basis, we counted nerve cells and epithelial cells in confocal image stacks through the body wall at various positions along the body column from the hypostome and tentacles to the basal disk. The results are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig 6</xref>. Most strikingly, there were no nerve cells in the endoderm of tentacles (see above). Similarly, the basal disk had very few nerve cells in the endoderm. In contrast to these two differentiated structures, the density of nerve cells in the body column endoderm is relatively constant (0.10-0.19) from the hypostome to the peduncle. The density of nerve cells in the ectoderm, however, changes dramatically along the body column. While the ratio of nerve to epithelial cells is relatively constant (0.15-0.22) in the gastric region and peduncle, the number of nerve cells in the ectoderm rises sharply in the hypostome, tentacles and basal disk. These are regions known to have a high level of new nerve cell differentiation (see Discussion).</p>

<title>The nerve net consists of closely associated parallel tracks of neurites (bundles)</title>
<p>The images in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref> do not reveal how the nerve net is constructed, i.e. how the size and shape of individual nerve cells contribute to the overall structure. Do the connections between nerve cells in the nerve net consist of overlapping neurites from neighboring cells or single neurites extending from one cell and synapsing on the next cell? To acquire such information, we stained transgenic nGreen polyps with hyCADab. This strain is a mosaic, in which not all stem cell precursors are transgenic. As a consequence, in a population of nGreen animals some polyps contain more and some fewer GFP-labeled nerve cells. We took advantage of this mosaicism to identify animals with relatively few GFP-labeled nerve cells. This allowed us to find isolated GFP-labeled nerve cells and thus image how such an individual nerve cell contributes to the hyCADab-stained nerve net.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> shows two GFP-labeled nerve cells in the ectoderm with long neurites extending parallel to the body axis. The green neurites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig 7A</xref>) are so closely associated with red hyCADab stained neurites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig 7B</xref>) that it is almost impossible to distinguish the two.

<p>The occurrence of bundles of parallel neurites suggests that a neurite from one cell may not only extend along the neurite of a neighboring cell, but also past the cell body of that neighboring cell. We have found numerous examples of such cell bodies in high-resolution confocal images. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> shows an example in which a red hyCADab-stained neurite passes next to a green GFP-labelled nerve cell body. A single optical section (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig 8 D-F</xref>) shows clearly that both the GFP-labeled and unlabeled neurites are stained with hyCADab. We also found examples in hyCADab stained preparations in which several tracks of neurites passed over a nerve cell body.</p>

The ends of GFP-labeled neurites usually lie somewhere along the nerve net at a site that was otherwise unremarkable (see asterisks in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig 7C</xref>).

<p>In addition, we used TEM cross-sections in the mid-body column to measure the relative frequency of neurite bundles with different numbers of neurites in a bundle. In the ectodermal nerve net, only about 20 percent of the cross-sectioned nerve tracks occurred as single neurites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Fig. 9C</xref>). About 80 percent of the nerve tracks occurred as bundles, many as bundles of 2 neurites, but often also as bundles consisting of 3-5 neurites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Fig. 9C</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9D</xref> shows a TEM cross-section of the endoderm in the middle of the body column with the basal muscle processes (green) directly adjacent to the mesoglea (yellow). Two major differences in nervous system architecture were obvious when endoderm was compared with ectoderm. First, endodermal neurites and neurite bundles, containing numerous dense core vesicles, were located at some distance from the endodermal muscle processes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Fig. 9D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">9D’</xref>), equivalent to the findings obtained with hyCADab staining in confocal images (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4B</xref>). Second, about half of the endodermal nerve tracks were single neurites, the other half were bundles containing two neurites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Fig. 9C</xref>). Bundles with more than two neurites were not found in the endoderm. Thus, in summary, the ectodermal nerve net is more directly associated with muscle processes and clearly exhibits higher connectivity than the endodermal nerve net.</p>
<p>To extend the TEM results, we analyzed two thousand serial sections of the ectodermal epithelium in the mid-body region. Serial sectioning was carried out with the block face SEM method. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Fig. 10</xref> shows a 3D reconstruction of the serial sections. The imaged block is 56 x 33 μm and includes two nerve cell bodies and corresponding parallel tracks of neurites (purple and green) lying adjacent to muscle processes of the ectodermal epithelial cells. Neurites from three additional nerve cells (turquoise, yellow and red) whose cell bodies lie outside the sectioned block run parallel to and are closely associated with the neurites from the two nerve cells shown. The 3D reconstruction confirms at high resolution that nerve tracks between nerve cell bodies consist of bundles of two or more tightly associated nerve processes. The distance between the two nerve cell bodies along the oral-aboral axis is roughly 50 μm, in agreement with the distribution of nerve cell bodies shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS2">Suppl.

<title>Nerve net growth occurs by lateral addition of new nerve cells to bundles</title>
<p>A unique feature of the <italic>Hydra</italic> nerve net is that it is a dynamic structure. It grows and is modified continuously. Since adult polyps do not increase in size, excess tissue generated by cell division is displaced into buds and to the ends of the body column (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Campbell, 1967</xref>). Tentacle tissue is continuously renewed by differentiation of battery cells at the base of tentacles. Basal disk tissue is similarly renewed. Cells are lost by sloughing from the tips of the tentacles and the center of the basal disk. How new nerve cells are added to the nerve net has not been known. The occurrence of bundles, however, suggests a simple way to add nerve cells to the net, by lateral association. Indeed, the image in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> of two GFP-labeled nerve cells laterally associated with the hyCADab stained nerve net supports a model of nerve net growth by lateral addition.</p>
<p>To investigate how new nerve precursors are added to the nerve net we grafted unlabeled AEP polyps to transgenic nGreen polyps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Fig 11</xref>). GFP-labeled nerve cell precursors migrated from the bottom half to the top half of such grafts and differentiated into new nerve cells. To localize the sites of new differentiation relative to the nerve net, we stained the grafts with hyCADab on day 1, 2 and 3 after grafting. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Fig. 11B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">C</xref> show images of young nerve cells (green) associating with the nerve net (red) on day 2. Migrating precursors without neurites do not associate with the nerve net and most differentiating nerve cells with short neurites on Day1 were also not associated with the nerve net (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Fig 11D</xref>). However, by Day 2 and 3 most differentiating nerve cells extended neurites along the nerve net (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Fig 11D</xref>).

<title>There are two separate nerve nets in <italic>Hydra</italic>: implications for motor control and contractile activity</title>
<p>HyCADab staining has permitted, for the first time, detailed imaging of the entire nerve net in <italic>Hydra.</italic> The results reveal two separate nerve nets, a net of interconnected nerve cells spread throughout the ectoderm and a second nerve net in the endoderm. There are no nerve cells in the endoderm of tentacles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig 5</xref>) and very few in the endoderm of the basal disk (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig 6</xref>). No connections between the two nerve nets were found, in agreement with earlier observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Hufnagel and Kass-Simon, 1976</xref>).</p>
<p>In the ectoderm, nerve cell bodies and nerve cell processes are closely associated with muscle processes at the base of ectodermal epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">C</xref>). TEM images of cross-sections of the body column confirm the close association of nerve cells with muscle processes in the ectoderm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Fig 9</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">10</xref>). This close association is consistent with direct nervous system control of body column contractions (see below). The localization of the endodermal nerve net is quite different. Endodermal nerve cells and their processes are located in a diffuse band at some distance from the endodermal muscle processes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig 4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Fig 9D</xref>). Furthermore the polygonal pattern of endodermal nerve cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig 2D</xref>) is completely different from the parallel array of endodermal muscle processes arranged circumferentially around the body column (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig 4B</xref>). Both results suggest that the endodermal nerve net is not directly involved in controlling the activity of endodermal muscle processes.</p>
<p>Recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Dupre and Yuste (2017)</xref> described electrical activity in nerve cells in a transgenic strain of <italic>Hydra</italic> that expresses the calcium reporter GCaMP6s in nerve cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Dupre and Yuste, 2017</xref>). They identified three discrete non-overlapping populations of nerve cells based on activity profiles (CB, RP1, RP2). Cells in each population fired together and there was no overlap between the firing patterns. The RP2 population was located in the endoderm, while the RP1 and CB populations were located in the ectoderm. The activity of the CB network was directly correlated with rapid contraction of the body column. The activity of the RP1 and RP2 networks was associated with slower changes in behavior.</p>
<p>The RP2 population is identical with the endodermal nerve net identified by hyCADab staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig 2D</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig 4B</xref>). Moreover, there are no RP2 nerve cells in the tentacles, in agreement with the absence of endodermal nerve cells in the tentacles as assayed by hyCADab staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig 5</xref>). The observation that the RP2 nerve net is not associated with rapid changes in behavior is consistent with the limited contact between the endodermal nerve net and endodermal muscle processes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig 4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">9D</xref>). However, endodermal ganglion cells do strongly express several neuropeptides, e.g. GLWa (Cazet et al., 2022; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Siebert et al., 2019</xref>) and release of such neuropeptides could modulate contractile activity in endodermal muscle processes. In particular <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Takahashi et al. (2003)</xref> have shown that GLWa induces slow contraction of the endoderm and consequently elongation of the body column (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Takahashi et al., 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>The two ectodermal circuits (RP1 and CB) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Dupre and Yuste, 2017</xref>) correspond to the ectodermal nerve net identified by hyCADab staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4A</xref>). Although the nerve net in the ectoderm appears to be homogeneous, the results of scRNAseq experiments indicate that it consists of two populations of ganglion cells, which express distinct neuropeptides (Cazet et al., 2022; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Siebert et al., 2019</xref>). Ec1 and Ec1/5 express the neuropeptide Hym176 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Noro et al., 2019</xref>) while Ec3 nerve cells express the neuropeptide GLWa.</p>
<p>To correlate nervous activity with muscle activity, transgenic <italic>Hydra</italic> that express distinct calcium reporters in ectodermal and ectodermal epithelial cells were made (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Szymanski and Yuste, 2019</xref>). This enabled detection of muscle activity in each epithelium during fast contraction of the body column initiated by CB nerve cells. The results showed that both ectodermal and endodermal epithelial cells responded simultaneously to activity of the CB circuit. Since there are no nerve cell connections between the ectoderm and the endoderm (see above), they postulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Wang et al., 2020</xref>) that the ectodermal muscle cells activate endodermal muscle cells directly via gap junction connections across the mesoglea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Hand and Gobel, 1972</xref>). This conclusion is consistent with our findings. Nerve cells in the ectoderm are closely associated with ectodermal muscle processes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig 4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">9</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">10</xref>) and TEM studies have described both chemical synapses and gap junctions between nerve cells and ectodermal muscle processes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS3">Suppl Fig 3</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Westfall, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Westfall et al., 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Westfall et al., 1980</xref>). By comparison, our results indicate that such contacts are rare in the endoderm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig 4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">9D</xref>) and there is no endodermal nervous activity associated with the fast contraction of the body column (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Dupre and Yuste, 2017</xref>).</p>

<title>Nerve cells and polyp form</title>
<p>The body column of <italic>Hydra</italic> is essentially a tube formed by two sheets of epithelial cells separated by a basement membrane (mesoglea). The tube is closed at the basal end by the basal disk and at the apical end by the mouth. The epithelial cells have muscle processes abutting the mesoglea. The muscle processes of endodermal cells are arranged circumferentially around the body column (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig 4B</xref>); muscle processes of ectodermal cells are arranged longitudinally, parallel to the oral/aboral axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig 4A</xref>). The combined force of these two muscle sheets gives rise to the tubular shape of the body column.</p>
<p>In addition to muscle tension, the shape and behavior of the body column is affected by osmotic pressure. <italic>Hydra</italic> polyps live in fresh water and there is constant diffusion of water into the cytoplasm of the epithelial cells. This water is transferred to the gastric cavity and periodically voided through the mouth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Benos and Prusch, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Benos and Prusch, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Yamamoto and Yuste, 2020</xref>) and potentially through the pore in the center of the basal disc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Shimizu et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>The nerve cells in the two epithelial layers affect the dynamic behavior of this system. This is clearly seen in nerve-free animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Campbell, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Marcum and Campbell, 1978</xref>). These animals no longer contract and are nearly motionless due to the absence of ectodermal nerve cells. The body column of nerve-free animals is also distended by increased osmotic pressure, which cannot be released through the closed mouth. However, regular experimental opening of the closed mouth in nerve-free animals leads to release of the gastric fluid and a return to normal tubular morphology of the body column (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Wanek et al., 1980</xref>). Thus one function of nerve cells in the endoderm is the control of endodermal muscle tension in response to osmotic pressure. This is a slow process, which could be caused by diffuse release of neuronal signaling molecules.</p>

<title>A role for the endodermal nerve net in feeding?</title>
<p>A striking feature of the endodermal nerve net is the large proportion of sensory cells, which constitute &gt;50% of all endodermal nerve cells. These cells are oriented toward the gastric cavity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig 2B</xref>) and have sensory cilia, which extend into the gastric cavity to monitor digestive activity and perhaps also osmotic strength. They are connected to the ganglion network at their basal ends and could induce signals affecting slow changes in endodermal muscle processes associated with digestion. Two such events occur following ingestion of prey. First endodermal muscle processes below the tentacle ring contract locally (“neck formation”) while endodermal muscles in the body column relax (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Blanquet and Lenhoff, 1967</xref>). Together these events create a closed space in the gastric cavity for digestion of prey. After digestion is complete, slow contraction of endodermal muscle processes restores the normal columnar form of the body column.</p>
<p>During digestion, slow waves of radial contraction move along the oral/aboral axis mixing the contents of the gut (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Shimizu et al., 2004</xref>). Both neck formation and radial contractions are absent or strongly reduced in nerve-free animals consistent with a role for the endodermal nerve net in regulating digestion. The complete absence of nerve cells in the endoderm of the tentacles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig 5</xref>), which are not involved in digestion, is consistent with this conclusion.</p>

<title>The two nerve nets consist of bundles of parallel nerve processes</title>
<p>Prior to the present results, it was not clear how the nerve net is constructed. One possibility was that nerve processes from neighboring cells simply meet and synapse “end-to-end” or that a neurite from one cell synapses on the cell body of a neighboring nerve cell. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figures 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8</xref> show that, surprisingly, this is not the case. The connections between nerve cells along the body column mainly consist of two or more neurites attaching laterally to form bundles in the ectoderm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Fig 9C</xref>). In the endoderm neurite bundles are smaller, consisting of maximally two neurites. The EM images in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Fig 9</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">10</xref> confirm that neurites in such bundles are closely associated and show in addition that neurites in bundles extend past neighboring nerve cell bodies. This close association provides ample opportunity for synapse formation, and TEM studies have identified both chemical synapses and electrical synapses (gap junctions) between nerve cells and between nerve cells and epithelial cells in the ectoderm. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Kinnamon and Westfall, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Kinnamon and Westfall, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Westfall et al., 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Westfall et al., 1980</xref>) Importantly, these synapses occurred at multiple sites along neurites, so-called en passant synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Westfall et al., 1971</xref>). Remarkable high-resolution SEM images document numerous spine-like structures extending out from the surface of neurites and nerve cell bodies. These appear to be sites of contact between neurites and between neurites and nerve cell bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Takahashi-Iwanaga et al., 1994</xref>).</p>
<p>Previously, the occurrence of neurite bundles in <italic>Hydra</italic> had only been described in <italic>Hydra</italic> species with a “nerve ring” surrounding the hypostome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Koizumi, 2007</xref>). In <italic>Hydra oligactis</italic> the nerve ring contained 20-30 nerve cells identified by staining with three different antibodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Koizumi et al., 1992</xref>) and TEM images of the nerve ring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Matsuno and Kageyama, 1984</xref>) showed that neurites and nerve cell bodies were tightly associated, similar to what is seen in the images in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Fig 9</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">10</xref>.</p>

<title>Potential role for gap junctions in nerve net communication</title>
<p>A striking feature of the CB, RP1 and RP2 nerve circuits characterized by Dupre and Yuste (see above) is that all nerve cells in a circuit fire almost simultaneously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Dupre and Yuste, 2017</xref>). This suggests that they are linked by electric synapses. Gap junctions between nerve cells have been described in the hypostome, peduncle and basal disk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Westfall et al., 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Takaku et al., 2014</xref>). Gap junctions are also present between nerve cells in bundles in the body column (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS3">Suppl Fig 3</xref>). However, detecting gap junctions by EM is laborious and in any case it is not possible to determine which nerve circuits are involved. Alternatively, scRNAseq results can now be used to detect innexin proteins and reveal which cell types express them. Innexins have been shown to form gap junctions in <italic>Hydra</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Alexopoulos et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Takaku et al., 2014</xref>) and a search of an updated scRNAseq database for <italic>Hydra</italic> (Cazet et al., 2022) has revealed that the three nerve cell populations constituting the CB, RP1 and RP2 circuits each express a specific innexin protein. The corresponding UMAPs are shown in Suppl <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig 4</xref>. No other nerve cell population expresses an innexin protein with the exception of endodermal sensory cells, which express innexin 15 (Suppl Fig 4). Although innexin 2 is expressed in both the CB and RP2 circuits, there is no contact between the nerve nets in the ectoderm and endoderm and hence no electrical connection can form between CB and RP2.</p>

<title>A model for continuous expansion of the nerve net in growing <italic>Hydra</italic> polyps</title>
<p><italic>Hydra</italic> polyps grow continuously, but maintain a nearly constant size. The increasing cell numbers are exported to buds, which develop in the lower body column and to tentacles and the basal disk, which are terminally differentiated and continuously replaced by tissue from the body column (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Campbell, 1967</xref>). As a consequence of this tissue growth, the <italic>Hydra</italic> nerve net expands due to the ongoing addition of new nerve cells to the nerve net. This addition has been clearly shown in experiments tracking the differentiation of fluorescently DiI-labeled nerve precursors in live animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Hager and David, 1997</xref>). Nerve cell differentiation occurred throughout the body column and maintained the constant ratio of nerve cells to epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig 6</xref>).</p>
<p>The DiI experiments, however, could not visualize how newly differentiated nerve cells attached to the nerve net, since the nerve net was not labeled. The new experiment shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Fig 11</xref>, in which the nerve net was imaged with hvCADab antibody, demonstrates that new nerve cells are added laterally to the existing nerve net. Thus, the nerve net is an overlay of individual nerve cells and neurites as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8</xref> and this overlay is a consequence of how it grows. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12</xref> summarizes these results in a simple model for growth of the nerve net. One consequence of this model is that elongating neurites terminate at apparently unspecific positions along a preexisting neurite track (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">10</xref>). A second consequence is that elongating neurites grow past neighboring nerve cell bodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Fig 9A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">10</xref>). Both features are supported by our results and suggest that the existing nerve net acts as a template for the addition of new nerve cells.</p>

<title>Nerve cell differentiation in the hypostome, tentacles, and peduncle</title>
<p>The results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig 6</xref> show that the nerve cell to epithelial cell ratio in the endoderm is nearly constant along the body column. As discussed above, this ratio can be maintained by continuous addition of new nerve cells to the nerve net during growth. Similarly, in the ectoderm of the gastric region and the peduncle, the nearly constant ratio of nerve cells to epithelial cells can be maintained by addition of new nerve cells to the existing nerve net.</p>
<p>The tentacles, hypostome, and basal disk, however, all contain increased numbers of nerve cells in the ectoderm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig 6</xref>) compared to the body column tissue from which they arise by tissue displacement. This implies new nerve cell differentiation in these tissues. This new differentiation has been well documented in earlier experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">David and Gierer, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Hager and David, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Hobmayer et al., 1990a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Hobmayer et al., 1990b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Technau and Holstein, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Yaross and Bode, 1978a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Yaross and Bode, 1978b</xref>) and is presumably associated with additional sensory and motor activities in these tissues. Indeed a fourth GCaMP6s activity pattern was identified in nerve cells at the base of tentacles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Dupre and Yuste, 2017</xref>), which was associated with movement of the head (nodding). A specific population of sensory nerve cells (Nv1) was identified which are incorporated into the battery cell complex in the ectoderm of tentacles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Hobmayer et al., 1990a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Hobmayer et al., 1990b</xref>). At the opposite end, in the lower peduncle, a population of nerve cells was identified, which express the <italic>innexin2</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Takaku et al., 2014</xref>). Elimination of these gap junctions disrupted contractile activity of the body column. In all of these examples, it is possible to imagine that the lateral addition of new nerve cells to the existing nerve net (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Fig 12</xref>) gives rise to local changes in nervous activity.</p>
<p>Finally, the nerve net is not just modified by addition as described above, but also by deletion of nerve cells. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figs 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>, there are no nerve cells in the endoderm of the tentacles, even though this tissue arises by displacement of body column tissue, which contains nerve cells in the endoderm. This implies that nerve cells in the endoderm are removed when endodermal tissue moves into tentacles. It appears likely that this occurs by apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Cikala et al., 1999</xref>), although this has not been observed directly. A similar process presumably removes nerve cells from endodermal tissue entering the basal disk. It also indicates a constant turnover of existing neuron-neuron and neuron-epithelial cell interactions. The molecules involved in the underlying feedback communication for these processes are unknown.</p>

<caption><p>Structure of <italic>Hydra</italic> tissue imaged in transgenic polyps expressing DsRed2 in ectodermal epithelial cells and GFP in endodermal epithelial cells. Nuclei are stained with DAPI. Images are maximum intensity projections of short stacks (3-5 um). Ectodermal nuclei are magenta (DAPI + DsRed2). Endodermal nuclei are turquoise (DAPI + GFP). Blue DAPI nuclei are non-transgenic interstitial cell derivatives. (A) Hypostome, tentacles and upper body column. Vertical optical section through the mouth region. (B) High magnification image showing endodermal cells of the mouth opening extending to the surface of the hypostome. Extensive black spaces in the endoderm are occupied by mucous cells. (C) Segment of tissue ring excised from the body column showing ectoderm (red) on the outside and endoderm (green) on the inside. Black spaces are non-transgenic interstitial cell derivatives (gland cells in the endoderm, interstitial stem cells and nematoblast nests in the ectoderm). (D) Longitudinal optical section through a tentacle showing large endodermal cells in center flanked by red ectodermal (battery) cells containing embedded nematocytes (blue nuclei in black spaces). Scale bars: (A) 150 μm, (B, C, D): 30 μm.</p></caption>

<caption><p>Representative images of hyCADab stained body column of a transgenic watermelon polyp (GFP in ectoderm, DsRed2 in endoderm) used to count epithelial cells and nerve cells. The images are 250 x 250 μm. The stack depth is 20 μm. Such images were used to count nerve cells and epithelial cells in the ectoderm. (A) hyCADab (red) stained nerve cells (nerve cell nuclei stained with DAPI are indicated by yellow spots). (B) anti-GFP (green) stained ectodermal epithelial cells; nuclei appear as round spots above parallel muscle processes at the base of the cells. Scale bar: 30 μm. (C) Nerve to epithelial cell ratio assayed by maceration and by cell counting in confocal image stacks (see Methods). Three maceration preparations containing 8, 9, and 10 animals respectively were scored to yield an average value of 0.12 nerve cells per epithelial cell. Seven hyCADab stained <italic>Hydra</italic> were imaged by confocal microscopy. The ratio of nerve cells to epithelial cells in confocal image stacks taken through the body wall in the gastric region varied between animals; the average value was 0.12 nerve cells per epithelial cell.</p></caption>

<p>This work presents findings on the cellular and ultrastructural organization of the nervous system in the freshwater polyp Hydra. Although the work presents potentially important data, there are several points that need to be addressed:</p>
<p>1. The antibody has to be properly validated as a tool for detecting all neurons. As it stands, the antibody might not recognize a cadherin and it is not clear whether it is specific and labels all neurons.</p>
<p>2. The lack of communication between the two nerve nets is an interesting observation, but its implications are limited due to technical reasons. This should be investigated further.</p>
<p>3. The apparent lack of typical terminal synaptic contacts and the predominant presence of &quot;en passant&quot; contacts in the neurite bundles could be the central element of the paper but this would have to be supported by more thorough observations and experiments.</p>
<p>4. The authors should highlight the novelty of the findings as compared to previous work that had already addressed some of these points.</p>

<p>In their manuscript, Keramidioti and co-authors investigate the cellular architecture of the nervous system in the freshwater polyp Hydra. Specifically, the authors attempt to improve the resolution, which is lacking in the previous studies, yet to generate a comprehensive overview of the entire nervous system's spatial organization and to infer communication between cells. To this end, Keramidioti et al. use state-of-the-art imaging approaches, such as confocal microscopy combined with the use of transgenic animals, transmission electron microscopy, and block face scanning electron microscopy. The authors present three major observations: i) A novel hyCADab antibody may be used to detect the entire nervous system of Hydra; ii) Nerve cells in the ectoderm and in the endoderm are organized in two separate nerve nets, which do not interact; iii) Both nerve nets are composed of bundles of overlapping nerve processes.</p>
<p>The manuscript addresses a long-standing and currently intensively studied question in developmental neurobiology biology - it attempts to reveal structural properties and principles that govern the function of the nervous systems in non-bilaterian animals. Hence, this study contributes to understanding the nervous system evolution trajectories. Therefore, the manuscript may represent interest to researchers interested in evolutionary and developmental neurobiology.</p>
<p>The manuscript reports a remarkably meticulous study and presents stunning imaging results. However, the manuscript would benefit from a more thorough presentation of immunochemical and electron microscopy data. The work would also greatly benefit from a more straightforward presentation of truly novel findings and a more concise summary of already-known aspects.</p>
<p>Major comments:</p>
<p>1. The novelty of findings.</p>
<p>2. The utility of the hyCADab as a pan-neuronal antibody.</p>
<p>The authors compare the density of neurons related to epithelial cells detected in whole mounts by the antibody with counts on macerates. Perhaps, a more direct and accurate approach would be to stain macerates with the antibody. In this way, one would be able to identify neurons by their morphology and validate whether 100% of them are hyCADab-positive.</p>
<p>The nGreen strain used by the authors is a mosaic one (see Materials and Methods). Hence, not all neurons are, in fact, labeled by GFP. Therefore, the argument that 51/51 GFP-positive cells are also hyCADab-positive is not convincing and insufficient to claim that hyCADab is a pan-neuronal antibody.</p>
<p>Finally, it is truly surprising that transgenic GFP-positive neurons are, in most cases, hyCADab-negative. (It is particularly evident in Fig. 11B. If the hyCADab antibody is indeed a pan-neuronal one, the red signal in the transgenic neurons should be as high as in the surrounding cells, and the cells would appear yellow).</p>
<p>1. The apparent absence of contact between the ectodermal and endodermal nerve nets.</p>
<p>Another limitation of the study by Keramidioti and co-authors is that they investigate sections only from the gastric region of a polyp. Earlier studies (for instance, Westfall, 1973) using TEM provided compelling evidence for communication between the ectodermal and endodermal nerve networks via neurites that cross the mesoglea. These neurites traversing mesoglea have been detected specifically in the hypostome of Hydra - the region not thoroughly investigated by Keramidioti et al. It is also surprising that transmesogleal bridges between ectodermal and endodermal epithelial cells, abundantly present not only in the hypostome but in the body column as well, can not be detected on any of the images provided by the authors. This suggests that their approach overall might be in general not suitable for addressing the question of connection and communication between the ectodermal and endodermal structures.</p>
<p>1. Formation of neurite bundles</p>
<p>Another aspect worth discussing in this context is whether the nerve system of Hydra can be organized in any other way. Given the architecture of epithelia in Hydra, there's virtually no other way for the neurites to run other than to form bundles - they occupy the narrow spaces between the epithelial cells and between their muscular fibers. The growth of the neurites thus appears constrained.</p>
<p>Finally, the functional implications of such bundle formation appear extremely interesting. Do neurons really form contacts in these bundles? Unfortunately, the authors provide no evidence for synaptic contacts within the bundles. This is somehow surprising given that numerous studies have effectively localized chemical and electric synapses in Hydra cells (e.g., Westfall et al., 1971). Overlapping of neurites may suggest an alternative, non-synaptic mechanism of signal propagation - via ephaptic coupling. It would be beneficial if the authors provided more TEM data on the presence or absence of synapses between neurites in the body column of Hydra. Some experiments, such as the dye coupling approach, may also help probe the existence of synaptic connections between the neurons forming a bundle.</p>

<p>In this paper by Keramidioti et al, the authors have characterized a polyclonal antibody from rabbit, which was raised against a peptide of the intracellular domain of the Hydra Cadherin. This antibody unexpectedly recognizes presumably all neurons in the Hydra polyp and indeed the specificity of the antibody is not fully convincing. Regardless, the antibody can be used to visualize and study the nerve net under a variety of conditions. The authors find that the endodermal and ectodermal nerve net do not make any contacts through the mesoglea, in contrast to earlier assumptions and data. They show that ectodermal neurons make close contacts to the myoepithelial muscles, in contrast to the endodermal muscles. Furthermore, they show that tentacle endoderm surprisingly does not have any neurons. Finally, a very nice tool to visualize the connections between the neurons is the staining of mosaic nGreen transgenic lines. This showed that the neurites align in parallel forming bundles of neurites over longer stretches, in particular in the ectoderm, which offers a mechanism how new neurons are added laterally to the existing nerve net. This has important implications about the way the neurons might communicate with each other.</p>
<p>Taken together, this paper adds to our knowledge of the Hydra nerve net and provides a new experimental tool. Although most of the study is rather descriptive the pictures are of spectacular quality, providing fascinating new insights into the arrangement and topology of the nerve net.</p>
