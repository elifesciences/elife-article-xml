<title>Abstract</title><p>Birnaviruses are a group of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) viruses infecting birds, fish and insects. Early endosomes (EE) constitute the platform for viral replication. Here, we study the mechanism of birnaviral targeting of EE membranes. Using the Infectious Bursal Disease Virus (IBDV) as a model, we validate that the viral protein 3 (VP3) binds to phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate (PI3P) present in EE membranes. We identify the domain of VP3 involved in PI3P-binding, named P2 and localized in the core of VP3, and establish the critical role of the arginine at position 200 (R<sub>200</sub>), conserved among all known birnaviruses. Mutating R<sub>200</sub> abolishes viral replication. Moreover, we propose a two-stage modular mechanism for VP3 association with EE. Firstly, the carboxy-terminal region of VP3 adsorbs on the membrane, and then the VP3 core reinforces the membrane engagement by specifically binding PI3P through its P2 domain, additionally promoting PI3P accumulation.</p>

<title>Significance Statement</title>
<p>Birnaviruses are a family of viruses unique among the group of dsRNA viruses. Here, we show that VP3 seizes the endosomes by anchoring to the PI3P lipids in the luminal side of the EE membrane, in order to organize the viral replication factory. We propose a two-stage modular mechanism for VP3 association with PI3P-enriched EE. The significance of this work resides in the biochemical and biophysical insights on the mechanism of association of VP3 with EE and its role in the viral life cycle, which represents a substantial contribution toward understanding the replication strategy of these “<italic>non-canonical</italic>” viruses.</p>

<title>Summary of Updates:</title>
<fn fn-type="update"><p>We thank the reviewers from eLife for their insightful comments on our study. In this newly submitted version, we have addressed all of the reviewers comments, notably by including modifications to the figures, the main manuscript, and a more-specific title, as suggested by two out of the three reviewers. We have diligently worked to clarify the manuscript on the use of recombinant proteins and have provided additional data to support our floatation and cryo-EM assays, thereby enhancing their consistency. We also provide additional results, incorporating important specificity controls and clarifying previous results. We believe that these additional data have substantially strengthened the quality of the manuscript.</p></fn>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Birnaviruses belong to the <italic>Birnaviridae</italic> family composed of nonenveloped icosahedral dsRNA viruses that infect a wide range of vertebrate and invertebrate hosts. The prototypical and best-characterized family member, the Infectious Bursal Disease Virus (IBDV), is the causative agent of Gumboro disease, a highly contagious immunosuppressive disease that affects young chickens (<italic>Gallus gallus</italic>) causing significant damage to the poultry industry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Delmas et al., 2019</xref>).</p>
<p>Birnaviruses are unconventional dsRNA viruses, as the virions lack a “<italic>core”,</italic> i.e., an inner protein layer containing the genome, which instead forms a filamentous ribonucleoprotein complex (RNP) with the multifunctional protein VP3, the RdRp VP1, and the dsRNA genome segments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Luque et al., 2009b</xref>). IBDV contains a single ∼70-nm diameter T = 13<italic>l</italic> icosahedral capsid surrounding a polyploid bipartite dsRNA genome (segments A and B, 3.2 and 2.8 kbp, respectively) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Luque et al., 2009a</xref>). The X-ray crystal structure of the capsid revealed that VP2 is the only component. VP2 has two main domains, a “shell” domain homologous to the coat proteins of +sRNA such as the T = 3 nodaviruses, and a “tower” domain, like those present in the T = 13 middle-layer protein of dsRNA viruses of the order <italic>Reovirales</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Coulibaly et al., 2005</xref>). VP3 is a 257-residues long polypeptide that plays multiple roles during the viral life cycle. In the mature virion, VP3 is a component of the RNPs, where it is associated with the dsRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Luque et al., 2009b</xref>). During viral assembly, VP3 acts as a scaffold protein via electrostatic interactions between basic residues of pVP2 (the precursor form of VP2), and acidic residues at the VP3 carboxy-terminal (Ct) region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Saugar et al., 2010</xref>). Additionally, VP3 interacts with VP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Lombardo et al., 1999</xref>). VP3’s multifunctional properties might be mediated by its capacity to form oligomers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Casañas et al., 2008</xref>), or by its intrinsically disordered regions. The X-ray crystal structure of the central region of the IBDV VP3 (residues 82 to 222) showed that it consists entirely of α-helices connected by loops which can be divided into two structural domains linked by a flexible hinge. The 36 Ct residues of the protein, a highly hydrophilic region rich in charged amino acids and proline residues, were predicted to be disordered, so it was excluded from the crystallized construct. The 81 amino-terminal (Nt) region of VP3 was cleaved during the crystallization process and was absent in the crystal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Casañas et al., 2008</xref>). The X-ray crystal structure indicated the presence of two positively charged domains, termed Patch 1 (P1) and Patch 2 (P2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Valli et al., 2012</xref>). Both patches are composed of four discontinuous, positively charged residues forming two exposed patches on the surface of the protein. P1 was demonstrated to be involved in the dsRNA binding-activity of VP3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Valli et al., 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>Previous studies on the subcellular localization of the IBDV replication complex (RC) have shown that IBDV replication components are localized to EE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Delgui et al., 2013</xref>). Further analysis revealed that VP3 associates with the cytosolic leaflet of EE membranes via P2, with a critical functional role in the virus life cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Gimenez et al., 2018</xref>). Additionally, the presence of PI3P in EE membranes was demonstrated to be a key host factor for VP3 association and the consequent establishment of IBDV RCs on EE membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Gimenez et al., 2020</xref>).</p>
<p>Here we study the mechanism mediating the birnaviral targeting of EE membranes, focusing on the VP3-PI3P interaction. Using biophysical approaches in cell-free <italic>in vitro</italic> systems, we demonstrate that PI3P constitutes the cellular partner for VP3 association to EE membranes. By introducing charge-reversal point mutations on VP3 P2, we establish the contribution of each of the four positively charged residues composing P2, with a key role of the arginine at position 200 (R<sub>200</sub>), a residue conserved across all known birnaviruses. Using a reverse genetic system for IBDV, we show that mutating R<sub>200</sub> abolishes viral replication. Finally, by using molecular simulations, we discuss a potential two-stage modular mechanism for VP3 association with EE. We show that, in the first step, the Ct flexible tail of VP3 adsorbs to the membrane by electrostatic interactions due to its positive charge. Then, in the second stage, the VP3 core reinforces the membrane engagement by recruiting PI3P molecules scattered in the EE membrane to the P2 region, promoting a stable VP3-PI3P interaction.</p>

<title>Biophysical characterization of VP3 binding to PI3P</title>
<p>We set up a liposome co-flotation assay to assess the binding of VP3 to PI3P in membranes. We expressed and purified His-tagged VP3 full-length (His-VP3 FL) and confirmed its identity by Western blot using specific anti-VP3 and anti-His antibodies. Since we observed four different bands for the purified protein, we confirmed their VP3-identity by mass spectrometry (<italic>SI Appendix</italic>, Fig. S1). We prepared two populations of liposomes: “liposomes PI3P(-)” and “liposomes PI3P(+)”. We confirmed that these preparations were suitable for evaluating the interaction with PI3P by monitoring co-flotation of a recombinant His-2xFYVE domain (<underline>F</underline>ab1p, <underline>Y</underline>OTB, <underline>V</underline>ac1p, and <underline>E</underline>EA1), followed by immunoblot detection of the His-tag. FYVE domains are highly homologous cysteine-rich domains of 70-80 amino acids present in around 30 human proteins that are known to participate in vesicular sorting or endocytosis through direct binding to PI3P from EE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Burd and Emr, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Gaullier et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Simonsen et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Stenmark et al., 1996</xref>) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). We observed specific binding of His-VP3 FL to liposomes PI3P(+), evidenced by a significant difference in the ability to bind to both liposome populations (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>). To test His-VP3 FL PI3P-binding specificity, we performed a co-flotation assay using liposomes where PI3P was replaced by 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphate (“liposomes PA”) or [1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-(1’-myo-inositol)] (“liposomes PI”) at the same molar ratio. PA contains a POH <sup>-</sup> group also present in the polar head of PI3P but lacks the inositol ring, while PI has the inositol ring but is not phosphorylated. We observed that His-VP3 FL bound to liposomes PI3P(+), but not to liposomes PA or PI, reinforcing the notion that a phosphoinositide is required since neither a single negative charge nor an inositol ring are sufficient to promote VP3 binding to liposomes (<italic>SI Appendix</italic>, Fig. S2).</p>

<p>Two additional biophysical approaches were implemented. First, we prepared liposomes PI3P(-) and PI3P(+), and incubated them with His-2xFYVE or His-VP3 FL that had been pre-bound to Ni-NTA [nickel (II) nitrilotriacetic acid] gold particles. Subsequently we inspected the preparations by cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM). Gold particles were not observed on liposomes PI3P(-) incubated with either protein (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig, 1C, left panel</xref>). We observed gold particles decorating liposomes PI3P(+) in the presence of both, His-2xFYVE and His-VP3 FL (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C, right panel</xref>). Second, we performed bio-layer interferometry (BLI) experiments using purified His-VP3 FL, and liposomes PI3P(-) and PI3P(+) (Shah et al., 2014). In the BLI experiments, the protein is immobilized on the tip of Ni-NTA sensors while the liposomes remain in solution, allowing to monitor the molecular interactions in real-time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Kairys et al., 2019</xref>). Purified His-Streptavidin and His-2xFYVE were used as negative and positive controls, respectively. A specific liposome PI3P(+) dose-dependent binding of His-2xFYVE and His-VP3 FL was observed (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>).</p>
<p>Previous studies indicated that the P2 is responsible for PI3P binding on EE membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Gimenez et al., 2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">2018</xref>). Yet the Ct region of VP3 is also highly enriched in positively charged residues. We generated a computational model of FL VP3 using AlphaFold2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Jumper et al., 2021</xref>), which predicted a disordered Ct region (pLDTT of 42.6) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>). Thus, we hypothesized that both conditions, the positive electrostatic surface charge and the disordered character of the VP3 Ct, might be contributing to the binding to the surface of EE. To test this hypothesis, we made a VP3 construct bearing a Ct truncation (His-VP3 ΔCt) and used it in co-flotation assays and BLI experiments. We did not detect interaction of this mutant with PI3P(-) nor PI3P(+) liposomes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F, G</xref>). Taken together, our results validate the role of PI3P in the interaction with VP3 and underscore the significance of the Ct domain in mediating this interaction.</p>

<title>Role of VP3 P2 in the association of VP3 with the EE membrane</title>
<p>Inspection of the VP3 crystal structure showed that P2 residues (K<sub>157</sub>, R<sub>159</sub>, H<sub>198</sub> and R<sub>200</sub>) form a positive-charged groove on the protein surface (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A-B</xref>). We prepared VP3 point mutants with reversed charge in a pcDNA vector backbone, giving rise to pcDNA VP3 K<sub>157</sub>D, R<sub>159</sub>D, H<sub>198</sub>D and R<sub>200</sub>D. The calculated electrostatic potential of P2 for each of these mutants is shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>. Firstly, we used QM7 cells transiently overexpressing VP3 P2 Wild Type (WT), P2 (all reversed) or the four single mutation of P2 to quantitatively assess their cellular distribution. We observed a punctuated distribution of VP3 P2 WT, K<sub>157</sub>D, R<sub>159</sub>D and H<sub>198</sub>D. In contrast, the specific indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) signal of VP3 P2 all reversed and R<sub>200</sub>D showed a diffuse cytosolic distribution (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D, panels framed in red</xref>). Secondly, we assessed the distribution of the VP3 constructs in QM7 cells transiently overexpressing EGFP-Rab5. Rab5 regulates the homotypic tethering and fusion of EEs, and it is considered a genuine marker of EEs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Gorvel et al., 1991</xref>). As observed in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref>, and the quantitative colocalization analysis (<italic>SI Appendix</italic>, Fig. S3), VP3 P2 WT, K<sub>157</sub>D, R<sub>159</sub>D and H<sub>198</sub>D showed a marked colocalization with EGFP-Rab5. In contrast, the VP3 P2 all reversed and R<sub>200</sub>D-derived IIF signal indicated a cytosolic distribution (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E, panels framed in red</xref>). It is important to mention that the differences in co-localization shown in Fig. S3 are small and not significant, but still show a trend that correlates with observations depicted in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>. Taken together, these results suggest that R<sub>200</sub> in the P2 patch bears a critical role in the association of VP3 with EE membranes.</p>

<title>VP3 P2 mediates VP3-PI3P association to EE membranes</title>
<p>To further assess the contribution of P2 residues to PI3P binding, and to strengthen the observations made on cells transiently overexpressing EGFP-Rab5, we set up two additional cell biology assays. One consists of co-transfecting cells with EGFP-2xFYVE and VP3 constructs, and detecting them by confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). The second one consists of assessing the ability of purified GST-2xFYVE, which recognizes endogenous PI3P, to co-localize with VP3. We employed QM7 cells transiently co-overexpressing EGFP-2xFYVE and VP3 P2 WT, P2 all reversed, or the four point mutants to evaluate their colocalization. As shown in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>, we observed a punctuated distribution with a marked co-localization with EGFP-2xFYVE for VP3 P2 WT while for VP3 P2 all reversed the IIF signal indicated a cytosolic distribution of the protein with the loss of colocalization with EGFP-2xFYVE (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A, red framed panels on the upper two rows</xref>). Regarding the point mutants, we observed a loss of punctuated distribution and EGFP-2xFYVE co-localization for VP3 FL R<sub>200</sub>D (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A, red framed panels on the bottom row</xref>). Then, we used the GST-2xFYVE purified domain to recognize endogenous PI3P in fixed cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Nascimbeni et al., 2017</xref>). GST-2xFYVE was used as the “primary antibody”, which was labelled with a fluorescent anti-GST antibody. As an additional control in these experiments, we immunostained the EE with antibodies anti-EEA1. As shown in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>, VP3 P2 WT demonstrated a conspicuous PI3P-bearing EEA1 positive endosomes location. In addition, we observed a similar distribution for VP3 K<sub>157D</sub>, R<sub>159</sub>D, and H<sub>198</sub>D and a drastic change in VP3 FL R<sub>200</sub>D mutant, which appeared utterly cytosolic, losing its capacity to bind to PI3P-bearing EE membranes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B, red framed panel on the lowest row</xref>).

<title>VP3 R<sub>200</sub> is crucial for binding to PI3P</title>
<p>To validate this, we devised a liposome co-flotation assay using a recombinant His-VP3 FL R<sub>200</sub>D mutant. When assayed in parallel with His-2xFYVE, we observed that His-VP3 FL R<sub>200</sub>D lost binding to PI3P(+) liposomes (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>). To confirm that the lack of binding was not due to misfolding of the mutant, we compared the circular dichroism spectra of His-VP3 FL and His-VP3 FL R<sub>200</sub>D proteins, without detecting significant differences (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>). To assess its relevance in IBDV infectivity, we resorted to an IBDV reverse genetics system, based on a modification of the system described by Qi and coworkers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Qi et al., 2007</xref>). The full length sequences of the IBDV RNA segments A and B, flanked by a hammerhead ribozyme at the 5’-end and the hepatitis delta ribozyme at the 3’-end, were expressed under the control of an RNA polymerase II promoter within the plasmids pCAGEN.Hmz.SegA.Hdz (SegA) and pCAGEN.Hmz.SegB.Hdz (SegB). For this specific experiment we generated a third plasmid, pCAGEN.Hmz.SegA.R<sub>200</sub>D.Hdz (SegA.R<sub>200</sub>D), harboring a mutant version of segment A cDNA containing the R<sub>200</sub>D substitution. Then, QM7 cells were transfected with the plasmids SegA, SegB or Seg.R<sub>200</sub>D alone (as controls) or with a mixture of plasmids SegA+SegB (wild type situation) or SegA.R<sub>200</sub>D+SegB (mutant situation). At 8 h post transfection (p.t.), when the new viruses have been able to assemble out of the two segments of RNA, the cells were recovered and re-plated onto fresh non-transfected cells to reveal the presence of infective viruses. At 72 h post-plating, the generation of foci forming units (FFUs) was revealed by Coomassie staining. As expected, single-transfections of SegA, SegB or Seg.R<sub>200</sub>D did not produce FFUs. As shown in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>, the transfection of SegA+SegB produced detectable FFUs (the three circles in the upper panel) while no FFUs (the three circles in the lower panel) were detected after the transfection of SegA.R<sub>200</sub>D+SegB (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>). Given the relevance of VP3 R<sub>200</sub>, we assessed its conservation among members of the <italic>Birnaviridae</italic> family. For this, a multiple sequence alignment of VP3 reference sequences was performed (<italic>SI Appendix</italic>, Fig. S4A). As shown, IBDV VP3 has 32-39% identity to the other selected homologues (<italic>SI Appendix</italic>, Fig. S4B). A closer look at the VP3 P2 revealed the complete conservation of R<sub>200</sub> (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref>). Taken together, these findings show that VP3 R<sub>200</sub> plays an important role mediating the VP3-PI3P interaction, highlighting the active participation of EE membranes during the infectious cycle of birnaviruses.</p>

<title>Electrostatic forces mediate VP3 membrane binding</title>
<p>Computer simulations based on coarse-grain models were performed to assess the binding free-energy and adsorption mechanism of three protein variants: VP3 Ct, VP3 ΔNt, and VP3 FL. The VP3 Ct region, with a positive electrical charge of +5, was modeled as an intrinsically disordered region according to the AlphaFold2 prediction (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>). VP3 ΔNt encompasses residues 82 to 257 and is electroneutral. This variant was chosen primarily because it retains the structural data from the crystallized protein. Similarly to His-VP3 FL, His-VP3 ΔNt retains the ability to bind to liposomes PI3P(+) (see <italic>SI Appendix</italic>, Fig. S5). Finally, VP3 FL is the full length monomeric VP3, using the AlphaFold2 predicted structure with an overall electrostatic charge of -3. We employed the Molecular Theory (MT) approach to obtain adsorption free-energy profiles, PMF(z), at different salt concentrations (Chiarpotti et al., 2021; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Ramírez et al., 2019</xref>). The membrane was modeled as a rigid dielectric slab with 5% of its surface occupied by ternary ionizable groups. <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref> (panels A-C) shows the PMF(z), where z represents the distance between the center of mass of the protein and the center of the membrane, at 50 and 150 mM NaCl. As observed in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>, the positively charged VP3 Ct shows the highest affinity for the membrane due to the deprotonation of the acidic lipids at pH 8, resulting in a net negative charge on the membrane surface (<italic>SI Appendix</italic>, Fig. S6). However, the electroneutral construct VP3 ΔNt has a lower binding energy than VP3 Ct, and also VP3 FL shows some degree of membrane binding, despite both the protein and the membrane being negatively charged, as evidenced by the shallow minimum in the PMF.</p>

<p>The binding of the three protein constructs was strongly affected by electrostatics, as shown in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D</xref>, where the adsorption energy is plotted as a function of the concentration of salt. The effect of salt concentration is most significant for VP3 Ct, but it is also noticeable for VP3 ΔNt and VP3 FL. Also, the interfacial concentration of each construct was higher at lower ionic strengths, as depicted in <italic>SI Appendix</italic>, Fig. S7. The weak binding energy of VP3 FL to the anionic membrane under physiological conditions (∼150 mM NaCl, pH 7) was consistent with the experimental observation that VP3 FL did not bind to liposomes PA and PI, which are anionic at the pH of the experiments. However, those same experiments showed that VP3 FL did bind to PI3P(+) liposomes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B-C</xref>), despite the MT calculations predicting weak binding. Taken together, our results suggest that specific VP3-PI3P interactions enhance the binding of VP3 to PI3P-containing EE membranes, while exhibiting weak and non-specific electrostatic attractions to an otherwise generic anionic membrane. <italic>SI Appendix</italic>, Fig. S8 illustrates the distribution of cationic residues of VP3 near the membrane, indicating that the Ct fragment drives the non-specific binding. To identify the electrical charge of different protein regions, <italic>SI Appendix</italic> Fig. S9 shows a map of the electrostatic potential around VP3 FL.</p>
<p>Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations based on the MARTINI model were employed to further investigate the mechanism by which VP3 Ct and VP3 ΔNt approach the membrane surface. We chose VP3 ΔNt over VP3 FL because VP3 ΔNt has a closer resemblance to the well-established experimental crystal structure. Additionally, the adsorption free energy profiles predicted by MT for both VP3 ΔNt and VP3 FL are notably similar (compare panels B and C of <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>). Unlike the MT model, MARTINI considers both electrostatic and van der Waals forces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">De Jong et al., 2013</xref>). To mimic the liposome PI3P(+) composition used in the co-flotation assays, the lipid bilayer was modeled with a molar ratio of 64:31:5 for the lipids DOPE, DOPC, and PI3P, respectively. DOPE and DOPC are electroneutral, PI3P is anionic. The MD simulations revealed that both VP3 Ct and VP3 ΔNt settled on the membrane surface after 120 ns, as shown in <italic>SI Appendix</italic>, Fig. S10. <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A-D</xref> shows a temporal sequence of configurations during the adsorption of VP3 ΔNt. The protein approached the membrane via the Ct fragment and remained adsorbed during the rest of the 500 ns trajectory. VP3 Ct exhibited the same behavior, as demonstrated in <italic>SI Appendix</italic>, Fig. S10 and Fig. S11. Notably, VP3 Ct and VP3 ΔNt did not detach from the surface during these MD simulations, suggesting that the adsorption energies calculated by MT were underestimated and represent a lower bound, as van der Waals interactions are absent in the MT model. Also, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6E</xref> highlights the location of the four positive residues that make up the P2 region, showing their proximity to the membrane surface.</p>

<title>Recruitment of PI3P modulates the membrane binding of VP3</title>
<p>We investigated the impact of VP3 Ct and VP3 ΔNt on the composition of the membrane near the binding point, and on the local curvature of PI3P(+) liposomes. We resorted to our MD simulations and evaluated the in-plane radial distribution function, g(r), between the center of mass of the proteins and the center of mass of PI3P molecules in the (cis) hemilayer, which is in direct contact with the protein. <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6F</xref> shows that VP3 Ct recruits PI3P within a ∼2 nm radius, where its local concentration in the cis hemilayer is up to 6 times greater than the average PI3P concentration (<italic>SI Appendix</italic>, Fig. S12). Also, despite having no net electrical charge, VP3 ΔNt induces a similar concentration enhancement, with PI3P accumulation occurring around the Ct fragment, as evidenced in <italic>SI Appendix</italic>, Fig. S13. In both cases, the recruitment of PI3P in the cis hemilayer is accompanied by a local depletion of PI3P in the trans hemilayer, due to interhemilayer electrostatic repulsions. The effects on PI3P concentration, induced by VP3 ΔNt, result from a synergistic action between the positively charged Ct and the P2 region of the protein. Furthermore, when mutations are introduced to the P2 region - starting with R<sub>200</sub>D and eventually including the entire P2 domain - there is a gradual reduction in its contribution to the recruitment of PI3P (see <italic>SI Appendix</italic>, Fig. S14). Molecular Theory calculations on these mutants also reveal that the binding free energy of both VP3 ΔNt P2 Mut and VP3 ΔNt R<sub>200</sub>D is consistently lower than that of VP3 ΔNt across all salt concentrations explored (see SI Appendix, Fig. S15). This indicates a weakening of the interaction with the negatively charged membrane, concomitant with the loss of positively charged amino acids.</p>
<p>Finally, to examine the potential impact of VP3 on the lipid bilayer, we incubated liposomes PI3P(-) and PI3P(+) with purified His-VP3 FL as described previously. The samples were cryo-fixed and cryo-EM was used to observe the resulting structures. As shown in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6G</xref>, His-VP3 FL distorts the membrane of liposomes containing PI3P, resulting in small pinches in the bilayer, detectable in 36% of the liposomes PI3P(+), while it is completely absent in PI3P(-) liposomes. Taken together, our findings suggest that the binding of VP3 to EE membranes has the potential to alter the local lipid composition by recruiting PI3P, which could then lead to the localized membrane pinches observed in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6G</xref>.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Several viruses hijack the PI3P metabolism machinery to complete their infectious cycle. However, only a few cases of viral proteins that bind PI3P have been described. Equine infectious anemia virus (EIAV) is a member of the lentivirus subgroup of retroviruses and replicates in macrophages. Retroviral assembly and release are directed by the structural precursor polyprotein Gag (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Wills and Craven, 1991</xref>). EIAV Gag localizes to both the cell interior and to the plasma membrane due to its high-affinity interaction with PI3P (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Fernandes et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Puffer et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Tanzi et al., 2003</xref>). Moreover, mutation of K<sub>49</sub>, a residue in the PIs-binding pocket of Gag inhibited the release of viral-like particles from the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Fernandes et al., 2011</xref>). Another example are the poxviruses, a family of cytoplasmic DNA viruses that also rely on intracellular membranes to develop their envelope, whose morphogenesis requires enzymes from the cellular phosphoinositide metabolic pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Mcnulty et al., 2010</xref>). For vaccinia virus (VACV), the prototypic poxvirus, Kolli and coworkers showed that the VACV H7 protein binds to PI3P and PI4P (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Kolli et al., 2015</xref>). Similarly to our observations in IBDV VP3, the authors uncovered two regions of H7 essential for viral replication. One region is a positive surface patch centered on K<sub>108</sub>, and the other region is the flexible Ct tail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Kolli et al., 2015</xref>).</p>
<p>Our biophysical and molecular simulation results suggest a specific but weak interaction of VP3 with PI3P bearing membranes. In co-floatation assays, we observed that His-VP3 FL reaches the top of the gradient, where liposomes PI3P(+) are located, with a high proportion of protein still found at the bottom of the gradient. This phenomenon was not observed with the His-2xFYVE protein. Additionally, the slopes of the BLI curves show that His-VP3 FL dissociate faster than His-2xFYVE from liposomes PI3P(+). Computer simulations have also revealed a weak attractive interaction between the negatively charged VP3 and membranes that contain PI3P. VP3 bears multiple essential roles during the viral life cycle. In this context, our hypothesis is that an early, specific, but weak interaction with PI3P is required for the formation of RCs associated with EE and represents an advantage for the virus that counts with VP3 to go forward into the replication cycle.</p>
<p>We identified the domain of VP3 involved in PI3P-binding, and established the critical role played by the arginine residue at position 200 of VP3 (R<sub>200</sub>). This arginine is conserved among all known birnaviruses. Mutating R<sub>200</sub> abolishes viral replication. As previously mentioned, VP3 is a multifunctional viral protein. Therefore, it was initially possible that mutating R<sub>200</sub> might affect other functions beyond PI3P binding and viral replication. However, R<sub>200</sub> is not located in any of the protein regions associated with its other known functions. For instance, the VP3 dimerization domain, located in the second helical domain, involves 81 interprotomeric contacts across three helices, but R<sub>200</sub> does not participate in these contacts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Casañas et al., 2008</xref>). Also, VP3 has an oligomerization domain mapped within the 42 C-terminal residues of the polypeptide, i.e., the segment of the protein composed by the residues at positions 216-257 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Maraver et al., 2003</xref>); VP3’s ability to bind RNA is facilitated by a region of positively-charged amino acids, identified as P1, which includes K<sub>99</sub>, R<sub>102</sub>, K<sub>105</sub>, and K<sub>106</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Valli et al., 2012</xref>). Furthermore, our findings indicate that the R<sub>200</sub>D mutant retains a folding pattern similar to the wild-type protein. All these lead us to conclude that the loss of replication capacity of R<sub>200</sub>D viruses results from impaired, or even loss of, VP3-PI3P interaction.</p>
<p>It has recently been reported that the RCs of IBDV exhibit liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Reddy et al., 2022</xref>). In LLPS, one or more biomolecules form a network of mild homo- and heterotypic interactions, resulting in the formation of a distinct liquid phase within a liquid medium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Banani et al., 2017</xref>). In light of our results, it is conceivable to hypothesize that viral interaction with the EE membranes acts as a first step in the RCs biogenesis, leading to the growth of biomolecular condensates with LLPS characteristics around EE membranes, as recently proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Brodrick and Broadbent, 2023</xref>). In support of this model, both the RNA dependent RNA polymerase VP1 and the viral dsRNA associate to endosomes and to the LLPS condensates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Delgui et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Reddy et al., 2022</xref>). Further experiments are needed in order to link the association of VP3 to EE membranes with biomolecular condensate formation.</p>

<title>Recombinant eukaryotic-expression plasmids</title>
<p>We used a <italic>Baculovirus</italic>-based eukaryotic system to obtain the His-VP3 FL, His-VP3 FL R<sub>200</sub>D and His-VP3 ΔCt fusion proteins. The construct of the recombinant baculovirus (rBV) His-VP3 FL was generated from IBDV VP3 FL protein [strain Soroa, GenBank AF140705.1, residues 756-1012 (257 residues) from the polyprotein] cloned in pcDNA vector. Thus, IBDV VP3 FL protein was subcloned from plasmid pcDNA VP3 FL into the pFast Bac HTb vector (Gibco BRL), which incorporates a 6xHis tag at the N-terminal of the recombinant protein. Briefly, VP3 FL coding sequence was amplified by PCR with the oligonucleotide pairs VP3.Fw and VP3.Rv incorporating <italic>Bam</italic>HI and <italic>Eco</italic>RI restriction sites, respectively (<italic>SI Appendix</italic>, Table 1). The resulting DNA fragment containing the VP3 gene was digested with <italic>Bam</italic>HI and <italic>Eco</italic>RI and ligated to plasmid pFast Bac HTb restricted with the same enzymes, generating the plasmid pFast Bac-his-VP3 FL. This plasmid contained the VP3 gene fused to a histidine tag under the control of the polyhedrin promoter. The complete fusion protein His-VP3 FL is 861 bp-long and contains 286 residues (∼32 kDa). The generation of rBV His-VP3 FL R<sub>200</sub>D was performed following the same procedure, but using the pcDNAVP3 FL R<sub>200</sub>D as a template for subcloning. The complete fusion protein His-VP3 FL R<sub>200</sub>D is 861 bp-long and contains 286 residues (∼32 kDa). The generation of rBV His-VP3 Δ223-257 (His-VP3 ΔCt) was performed as follows. A 663 nucleotide DNA fragment containing a truncated version of the VP3 sequence encoding a polypeptide lacking the 36 carboxi-terminal residues was amplified by PCR from pcDNAVP3 FL with the oligonucleotide pairs VP3.Fw and VP3 Δ223-257.Rv incorporating <italic>Bam</italic>HI and <italic>Eco</italic>RI restriction sites, respectively (<italic>SI Appendix</italic>, Table 1).

All the resulting plasmids were subjected to nucleotide sequencing to assess the correctness of the inserted VP3 sequence, and they were then used to produce the corresponding rBVs by using the Bac-to-Bac system and by following the manufacturer’s instructions (Invitrogen). Briefly, the recombinant plasmids were transformed into DH10Bac competent cells to obtain recombinant bacmids. The white colonies on culture plates were picked, confirmed by PCR and used for Sf9 cell transfection by using Cellfectin II Reagent (Gibco). The transfected cells were cultured at 28°C for 5 days to produce rBVs. Then, the cells were subjected to Western blot analysis for recombinant proteins expression confirmation and the supernatant (P1) was used to amplify the rBVs to a higher-titre P2 and scaled up to obtain a higher volume of P3 to be titrated (Plate-Forme Technologique Production et Purification de Protéines Recombinantes, Institut Pasteur) and used for protein production.</p>

<title>Coarse Grain (CG) models of VP3 constructs</title>
<p>Three main protein constructs derived from VP3 were considered: 1. VP3 Ct. A peptide comprising the last 36 residues of VP3 (223 to 257). VP3 Ct has an overall electrical charge of +5, and is absent from the available crystal structure of VP3. Consequently, it was assumed to be a disordered domain and was modeled as unstructured. 2. VP3 ΔNt. A shorter version of VP3 that lacks the first 81 residues leading to the Nt. It consists of the crystallized structure of the protein core (residues 82 to 222, available from the Protein Data Bank PDB ID 2R18), concatenated with the VP3 Ct peptide. As the first 9 residues of the protein core are also missing from resolved structure, they were modeled as unstructured, similar to the VP3 Ct fragment. VP3 ΔNt was selected primarily because it contains the structural information of the crystallized protein, which provides valuable insights into the protein’s overall structure and function. In addition, the construct includes the Ct peptide (VP3 Ct), which is crucial for membrane binding. Although the Nt 81 residues are absent in this construct, their exclusion was found to be inconsequential in terms of evaluating the protein’s binding energy and positioning on the membrane surface (compare, for example, VP3 ΔNt and VP3 FL in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>). 3. VP3 FL. The full-length VP3 protein, which was obtained as an AlphaFold2 prediction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Jumper et al., 2021</xref>). The structure of the protein predicted by AlphaFold2 not only provided insight into the overall architecture of VP3, but it also reinforced our model of unstructured VP3 Ct. It is worth noting that the Nt 81 residues, which are absent in VP3 ΔNt, are predicted to be in a modular conformation, constituting a globular domain separated by a loop from the globular domain of the core region (crystallized residues 82 to 222). The structural information provided by the full-length VP3 model is therefore useful in understanding the interaction with lipid membranes. In addition to VP3 Ct, VP3 ΔNt, and VP3 FL, two mutants of VP3 ΔNt were simulated: VP3 ΔNt R<sub>200</sub>D, in which R<sub>200</sub> was replaced by aspartate (D), and VP3 ΔNt P2 Mut, where the whole P2 region (R<sub>200</sub>, H<sub>198</sub>, R<sub>159</sub>, and K<sub>157</sub>) was replaced by D. All proteins were modeled with the MARTINI force-field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">De Jong et al., 2013</xref>) [whenever needed, the secondary structure of the non-disordered protein domains was restrained by means of the ElNeDyn elastic network model (elnedyn22)] (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Periole et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Poma et al., 2017</xref>). In this case, harmonic potentials with a force constant of 1000 kJ mol<sup>−1</sup> nm<sup>2</sup> were applied between backbone particles separated by less than 1.4 nm. In the construction of VP3 ΔNt, elastic network restrictions were applied to residues 91 to 220, which was the fragment resolved from by crystallography. However, in VP3 FL, the elastic network was applied to all globular domains, while leaving the linkers and the last 36 residues at the Ct unrestricted.</p>

<title>Molecular Theory calculations</title>
<p>The Molecular Theory (MT) used to assess protein adsorption is detailed in references (Chiarpotti et al., 2021; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Ramírez et al., 2019</xref>). Briefly, this mean-field method yields the distribution of macromolecules in an anisotropic system, through the minimization of a model free-energy functional that accounts for electrostatic and steric interactions, the configurational and translational entropy of the macromolecules, the translational entropy of the free species (protons, hydroxyls, and salt ions) and the acid-base equilibrium of all ionizable molecules in the system. In the present case, the membrane was modeled as a dielectric slab of thickness h, with a dielectric constant ε<sub>M</sub>, which is in contact with a solution of dielectric constant ε<sub>S</sub>. Far from the membrane (z→∞), the solution is in contact with an infinite bulk that contains the proteins (1 μM concentration), all the free species, and a fixed pH=8. The rigid membrane contained 15% of ionizable groups on its surface, in order to mimic the 5% of ternary ionizable PI3P. One third of these groups were assigned a pK<sub>a</sub> of 2.5, corresponding to the phosphate group of the glycerol moiety, while the pK<sub>a</sub> for the rest was set to 6.5, corresponding to the phosphoesther groups of inositol. MT requires the input of a large set of protein conformations, which are subsequently reweighted by the theory. These conformations were generated by Molecular Dynamics simulations of the proteins in water. VP3 Ct, VP3 ΔNt, VP3 FL, VP3 ΔNt R<sub>200</sub>D, and VP3 ΔNt P2 Mut, were modeled using MARTINI-2.2 parameters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Marrink et al., 2007</xref>). The proteins were hydrated in MARTINI polarizable water. As stated before, the proteins globular segments (residues 92-222 in VP3 FL, VP3 ΔNt and its mutants, and residues 7-79 additionally in VP3 FL) were restricted through the application of the elastic network ElNeDyn (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Marrink et al., 2007</xref>) with a spring constant of 1000 kJ.mol<sup>−1</sup> applied to backbone beads (BB) within a cutoff distance of 1.4 nm. Each protein was simulated for 100 ns, after equilibration, in the NPT ensemble using GROMACS 2021.3. A cluster analysis was performed in order to obtain the most representative conformations of the simulated ensemble. This method groups conformations by structural similarity, using the root mean squared deviation (RMSD) of the coordinates calculated for all conformer pairs along the trajectory, clustering structures with RMSD ≤ 0.3 nm. This procedure leads to 50 conformers for each protein construct. Each conformer was subsequently rotated 30 times randomly to produce a set of 1500 configurations for the MT calculations.</p>

The protein was placed at a distance of 10 nm from the membrane surface, to avoid a possible initial binding bias. The system was then equilibrated and finally simulated for 500 ns.

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Zanetti et al use biophysical and cellular assays to investigate the interaction of the birnavirus VP3 protein with the early endosome lipid PI3P. The major novel finding is that association of the VP3 protein with an anionic lipid (PI3P) appears to be important for viral replication, as evidenced through a cellular assay on FFUs.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Support previously published claims that VP3 associates with early endosome membrane, potentially through binding to PI3P. The finding that mutating a single residue (R200) critically affects early endosome binding and that the same mutation also inhibits viral replication suggests a very important role for this binding in the viral life cycle.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The manuscript is relatively narrowly focused: the specifics of the bi-molecular interaction between the VP3 of an unusual avian virus and a host cell lipid (PIP3). Further, the affinity of this interaction is low and its specificity relative to other PIPs is not tested, leading to questions about whether VP3-PI3P binding is relevant.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) is a birnavirus and an important avian pathogen. Interestingly, IBDV appears to be a unique dsRNA virus that uses early endosomes for RNA replication that is more common for +ssRNA viruses such as for example SARS-CoV-2.</p>
<p>This work builds on previous studies showing that IBDV VP3 interacts with PIP3 during virus replication. The authors provide further biophysical evidence for the interaction and map the interacting domain on VP3.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Detailed characterization of the interaction between VP3 and PIP3 identified R200D mutation as critical for the interaction. Cryo-EM data show that VP3 leads to membrane deformation.</p>
<p>Comments on revisions:</p>
<p>I have no further comments. The authors have addressed my questions and concerns. I congratulate the authors on their work!</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Zanetti et al use biophysical and cellular assays to investigate the interaction of the birnavirus VP3 protein with the early endosome lipid PI3P. The major novel finding is that association of the VP3 protein with an anionic lipid (PI3P) appears to be important for viral replication, as evidenced through a cellular assay on FFUs.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Support previously published claims that VP3 associates with early endosome membrane, potentially through binding to PI3P. The finding that mutating a single residue (R200) critically affects early endosome binding and that the same mutation also inhibits viral replication suggests a very important role for this binding in the viral life cycle.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The manuscript is relatively narrowly focused: the specifics of the bi-molecular interaction between the VP3 of an unusual avian virus and a host cell lipid (PIP3). Further, the affinity of this interaction is low and its specificity relative to other PIPs is not tested, leading to questions about whether VP3-PI3P binding is relevant.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Regarding the manuscript’s focus, we challenge the notion that studying a single bi-molecular interaction makes the scope of the paper overly narrow. This interaction—between VP3 and PI3P—plays a critical role in the replication of the birnavirus, which is the central theme of our work. Moreover, identifying and understanding such distinct interactions is a fundamental aspect of molecular virology, as they shed light on the precise mechanisms that viruses exploit to hijack the host cell machinery. Consequently, far from being narrowly focused, we believe our work contributes to the broader understanding of host-pathogen interactions.</p>
<p>As for the low affinity of the VP3-PI3P interaction, we argue that this is not a limitation but rather a biologically relevant feature. As discussed in the manuscript, the moderate strength of this interaction is likely critical for regulating the turnover rate of VP3/endosomal PI3P complexes, which in turn could optimize viral replication efficiency. A stronger affinity might trap VP3 on the endosomal membrane, whereas weaker interactions might reduce its ability to efficiently target PI3P. Thus, the observed affinity may reflect a fine-tuned balance that supports the viral life cycle.</p>
<p>With regard to specificity, we emphasize that in the context of the paper, we refer to biological specificity, which is not necessarily the same as chemical specificity. The binding of PI3P to early endosomes is “biologically” preconditioned by the distribution of PI3P within the cell. PI3P is predominantly localized in endosomal membranes, which “biologically precludes” interference from other PIPs due to their distinct cellular distributions. Moreover, while early endosomes also contain other anionic lipids, our work demonstrates that among these, PI3P plays a distinctive role in VP3 binding. This highlights its functional relevance in the context of early endosome dynamics.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) is a birnavirus and an important avian pathogen. Interestingly, IBDV appears to be a unique dsRNA virus that uses early endosomes for RNA replication that is more common for +ssRNA viruses such as for example SARS-CoV-2. This work builds on previous studies showing that IBDV VP3 interacts with PIP3 during virus replication. The authors provide further biophysical evidence for the interaction and map the interacting domain on VP3.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Detailed characterization of the interaction between VP3 and PIP3 identified R200D mutation as critical for the interaction. Cryo-EM data show that VP3 leads to membrane deformation.</p>

<p>We thank the reviewer for the feedback.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Zanetti <italic>et al</italic>. use biophysical and cellular assays to investigate the interaction of the birnavirus VP3 protein with the early endosome lipid PI3P. The major novel finding is that the association of the VP3 protein with an anionic lipid (PI3P) appears to be important for viral replication, as evidenced through a cellular assay on FFUs.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Supports previously published claims that VP3 may associate with early endosomes and bind to PI3P-containing membranes. The claim that mutating a single residue (R<sub>200</sub>) critically affects early endosome binding and that the same mutation also inhibits viral replication suggests a very important role for this binding in the viral life cycle.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The manuscript is relatively narrowly focused: one bimolecular interaction between a host cell lipid and one protein of an unusual avian virus (VP3-PI3P). Aspects of this interaction have been described previously. Additional data would strengthen claims about the specificity and some technical issues should be addressed. Many of the core claims would benefit from additional experimental support to improve consistency.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Indeed, our group has previously described aspects of the VP3-PI3P interaction, as indicated in lines 100-105 from the manuscript. In this manuscript, however, we present biochemical and biophysical details that have not been reported before about how VP3 connects with early endosomes, showing that it interacts directly with the PI3P. Additionally, we have now identified a critical residue in VP3—the R<sub>200</sub>—for binding to PI3P and its key role in the viral life cycle. Furthermore, the molecular dynamics simulations helped us come up with a mechanism for VP3 to connect with PI3P in early endosomes. This constitutes a big step forward in our understanding of how these &quot;<italic>non-canonical</italic>&quot; viruses replicate.</p>
<p>We have now incorporated new experimental and simulation data; and have carefully revised the manuscript in accordance with the reviewers’ recommendations. We are confident that these improvements have further strengthened the manuscript.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Birnavirus replication factories form alongside early endosomes (EEs) in the host cell cytoplasm. Previous work from the Delgui lab has shown that the VP3 protein of the birnavirus strain infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) interacts with phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate (PI3P) within the EE membrane (Gimenez et al., 2018, 2020). Here, Zanetti <italic>et al</italic>. extend this previous work by biochemically mapping the specific determinants within IBDV VP3 that are required for PI3P binding <italic>in vitro</italic>, and they employ <italic>in silico</italic> simulations to propose a biophysical model for VP3-PI3P interactions.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The manuscript is generally well-written, and much of the data is rigorous and solid. The results provide deep knowledge into how birnaviruses might nucleate factories in association with EEs. The combination of approaches (biochemical, imaging, and computational) employed to investigate VP3-PI3P interactions is deemed a strength.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) Concerns about the sources, sizes, and amounts of recombinant proteins used for co-flotation: Figures 1A, 1B, 1G, and 4A show the results of co-flotation experiments in which recombinant proteins (control His-FYVE v. either full length or mutant His VP3) were either found to be associated with membranes (top) or non-associated (bottom). However, in some experiments, the total amounts of protein in the top + bottom fractions do not appear to be consistent in control v. experimental conditions. For instance, the Figure 4A western blot of His-2xFYVE following co-flotation with PI3P+ membranes shows almost no detectable protein in either top or bottom fractions.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Liposome-based methods, such as the co-flotation assay, are well-established and widely regarded as the preferred approach for studying protein-phosphoinositide interactions. However, this approach is rather qualitative, as density gradient separation reveals whether the protein is located in the top fractions (bound to liposomes) or the bottom fractions (unbound). Our quantifications aim to demonstrate differences in the bound fraction between liposome populations with and without PI3P. Given the setting of the co-flotation assays, each protein-liposome system [2xFYVE-PI3P(-), 2xFYVE-PI3P(+), VP3-PI3P(-), or VP3-PI3P(+)] is assessed separately, and even if the experimental conditions are homogeneous, it is not surprising to observe differences in the protein level between different experiments. Indeed, the revised version of the manuscript includes membranes with more similar band intensities, as depicted in the new versions of Figures 1 and 4.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Reading the paper, it was difficult to understand which source of protein was used for each experiment (i.e., <italic>E. coli</italic> or baculovirus-expressed), and this information is contradicted in several places (see lines 358-359 v. 383-384). Also, both the control protein and the His-VP3-FL proteins show up as several bands in the western blots, but they don't appear to be consistent with the sizes of the proteins stated on lines 383-384. For example, line 383 states that His-VP3-FL is ~43 kDa, but the blots show triplet bands that are all below the 35 kDa marker (Figures 1B and 1G). Mass spectrometry information is shown in the supplemental data (describing the different bands for His-VP3-FL) but this is not mentioned in the actual manuscript, causing confusion. Finally, the results appear to differ throughout the paper (see Figures 1B v. 1G and 1A v. 4A).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for pointing out these potentially confusing points in the previous version of the manuscript. Indeed, we were able to produce recombinant VP3 from the two sources: Baculovirus and <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>. Initially, we opted for the baculovirus system, based on evidence from previous studies showing that it was suitable for ectopic expression of VP3. Subsequently, we successfully produced VP3 using <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>. On the other side, the fusion proteins His-2xFYVE and GST-2xFYVE were only produced in the prokaryotic system, also following previous reported evidence. We confirmed that VP3, produced in either system, exhibited similar behavior in our co-flotation and bio-layer interferometry (BLI) assays. However, the results of co-flotation and BLI assays shown in Figs. 1 and 4 were performed using the His-VP3 FL, His-VP3 FL R<sub>200</sub>D and His-VP3 FL DCt fusion proteins produced from the corresponding baculoviruses. We have clarified this in the revised version of our manuscript. Please, see lines 430-432.</p>
<p>Additionally, we have made clear that the His-VP3 FL protein purification yielded four distinct bands, and we confirmed their VP3 identity through mass spectrometry in the revised version of the manuscript. Please, see lines 123-124.</p>
<p>Finally, we replaced membranes for Figs. 4A and 1G (left panel) with those with more similar band intensities. Please, see the new version of Figures 1 and 4.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) Possible &quot;other&quot; effects of the R<sub>200</sub>D mutation on the VP3 protein. The authors performed mutagenesis to identify which residues within patch 2 on VP3 are important for association with PI3P. They found that a VP3 mutant with an engineered R<sub>200</sub>D change (i) did not associate with PI3P membranes in co-floatation assays, and (ii) did not co-localize with EE markers in transfected cells. Moreover, this mutation resulted in the loss of IBDV viability in reverse genetics studies. The authors interpret these results to indicate that this residue is important for &quot;mediating VP3-PI3P interaction&quot; (line 211) and that this interaction is essential for viral replication. However, it seems possible that this mutation abrogated other aspects of VP3 function (e.g., dimerization or other protein/RNA interactions) aside from or in addition to PI3P binding. Such possibilities are not mentioned by the authors.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The arginine amino acid at position 200 of VP3 is not located in any of the protein regions associated with its other known functions: VP3 has a dimerization domain located in the second helical domain, where different amino acids across the three helices form a total of 81 interprotomeric close contacts; however, R<sub>200</sub> is not involved in these contacts (Structure. 2008 Jan;16(1):29-37, doi:10.1016/j.str.2007.10.023); VP3 has an oligomerization domain mapped within the 42 C-terminal residues of the polypeptide, i.e., the segment of the protein composed by the residues at positions 216-257 (<italic>J Virol</italic>. 2003 Jun;77(11):6438–6449, doi: 10.1128/jvi.77.11.6438-6449.2003); VP3’s ability to bind RNA is facilitated by a region of positively-charged amino acids, identified as P1, which includes K<sub>99</sub>, R<sub>102</sub>, K<sub>105</sub>, and K<sub>106</sub> (<italic>PLoS One</italic>. 2012;7(9):e45957, doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0045957). Furthermore, our findings indicate that the R<sub>200</sub>D mutant retains a folding pattern similar to the wild-type protein, as shown in Figure 4B. All these lead us to conclude that the loss of replication capacity of R<sub>200</sub>D viruses results from impaired, or even loss of, VP3-PI3P interaction.</p>
<p>We agree with the reviewer that this is an important point and have accordingly addressed it in the Discussion section of the revised manuscript. Please, see lines 333-346.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) Interpretations from computational simulations. The authors performed computational simulations on the VP3 structure to infer how the protein might interact with membranes. Such computational approaches are powerful hypothesis-generating tools. However, additional biochemical evidence beyond what is presented would be required to support the authors' claims that they &quot;unveiled a two-stage modular mechanism&quot; for VP3-PI3P interactions (see lines 55-59). Moreover, given the biochemical data presented for R<sub>200</sub>D VP3, it was surprising that the authors did not perform computational simulations on this mutant. The inclusion of such an experiment would help tie together the in vitro and in silico data and strengthen the manuscript.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We acknowledge that the wording used in the previous version of the manuscript may have overstated the &quot;unveiling&quot; of the two-stage binding mechanism of VP3. Our intention was to propose a potential mechanism, that is consistent both with the biophysical experiments and the molecular simulations. In the revised version of the manuscript, we have tempered these claims and framed them more appropriately.</p>
<p>Regarding the simulations for the R<sub>200</sub>D VP3 mutant, these simulations were indeed performed and included in the original manuscript as part of Figure S14 in the Supplementary Information. However, we realize that this was not sufficiently emphasized in the main text, an oversight on our part. We have now revised the manuscript to highlight these results more clearly.</p>
<p>Additionally, to further strengthen the connection between experimental and simulation trends, we have now included a new figure in the Supplementary Information (Figure S15). This figure depicts the binding energy of VP3 ΔNt and two of its mutants, VP3 ΔNt R<sub>200</sub>D and VP3 ΔNt P2 Mut, as a function of salt concentration. The results show that as the number of positively charged residues in VP3 is systematically reduced, the binding of the protein to the membrane becomes weaker. The effect is more pronounced at lower salt concentrations, which highlights the weight of electrostatic forces on the adsorption of VP3 on negatively charged membranes. Please, see Supplementary Information (Figure S15).</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) is a birnavirus and an important avian pathogen. Interestingly, IBDV appears to be a unique dsRNA virus that uses early endosomes for RNA replication that is more common for +ssRNA viruses such as for example SARS-CoV-2.</p>
<p>This work builds on previous studies showing that IBDV VP3 interacts with PIP3 during virus replication. The authors provide further biophysical evidence for the interaction and map the interacting domain on VP3.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Detailed characterization of the interaction between VP3 and PIP3 identified R<sub>200</sub>D mutation as critical for the interaction. Cryo-EM data show that VP3 leads to membrane deformation.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The work does not directly show that the identified R<sub>200</sub> residues are directly involved in VP3-early endosome recruitment during infection. The majority of work is done with transfected VP3 protein (or <italic>in vitro</italic>) and not in virus-infected cells. Additional controls such as the use of PIP3 antagonizing drugs in infected cells together with a colocalization study of VP3 with early endosomes would strengthen the study.</p>
<p>In addition, it would be advisable to include a control for cryo-EM using liposomes that do not contain PIP3 but are incubated with HIS-VP3-FL. This would allow ruling out any unspecific binding that might not be detected on WB.</p>
<p>The authors also do not propose how their findings could be translated into drug development that could be applied to protect poultry during an outbreak. The title of the manuscript is broad and would improve with rewording so that it captures what the authors achieved.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In previous works from our group, we demonstrated the crucial role of the VP3 P2 region in targeting the early endosomal membranes and for viral replication, including the use of PI3K inhibitors to deplete PI3P, showing that both the control RFP-2xFYVE and VP3 lost their ability to associate with the early endosomal membranes and reduces the production of an infective viral progeny (<italic>J Virol</italic>. 2018 May 14;92(11):e01964-17, doi: 10.1128/jvi.01964-17; <italic>J Virol</italic>. 2021 Feb 24;95(6):e02313-20, doi: 10.1128/jvi.02313-20). In the present work, to further characterize the role of R<sub>200</sub> in binding to early endosomes and for viral replication, we show that: i) the transfected VP3 R<sub>200</sub>D protein loses the ability to bind to early endosomes in immunofluorescence assays (Figure 2E and Figure 3); ii) the recombinant His-VP3 FL R<sub>200</sub>D protein loses the ability to bind to liposomes PI3P(+) in co-flotation assays (Figure 4A); and, iii) the mutant virus R<sub>200</sub>D loses replication capacity (Figure 4C).</p>
<p>Regarding the cryo-electron microscopy observation, we verified that there is no binding of gold particles to liposomes PI3P(-) when they are incubated solely with the gold-particle reagent, or when they are pre-incubated with the gold-particle reagent with either His-2xFYVE or His-VP3 FL. We have incorporated a new panel in Figure 1C showing a representative image of these results. Please, see lines 143-144 in the revised version of our manuscript and our revised version of Figure 1C.</p>
<p>We have replaced the title of the manuscript by a more specific one. Thus, our current is &quot; On the Role of VP3-PI3P Interaction in Birnavirus Endosomal Membrane Targeting&quot;.</p>
<p>Regarding the question of how our findings could be translated into drug development, indeed, VP3-PI3P binding constitutes a good potential target for drugs that counteract infectious bursal disease. However, we did not mention this idea in the manuscript, first because it is somewhat speculative and second because infected farms do not implement any specific treatment. The control is based on vaccination.</p>

<p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>Critical issues to address:</p>
<p>(1) The citations in the important paragraph on lines 101-5 are not identifiable. These references are described as showing that VP3 is associated with EEs via P2 and PI3P, which is basically what this paper also shows. The significant advance here is unclear.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We apologize for this mistake. These citations are identifiable in the revised version of the manuscript (lines 100-105). As mentioned before, in this manuscript we present biochemical and biophysical details that have not been reported before about how VP3 connects with early endosomes, showing that it interacts directly with the PI3P. Additionally, we have now identified a critical residue in VP3 P2—the R<sub>200</sub>—for binding to PI3P and its key role in the viral life cycle. Furthermore, the molecular dynamics simulations helped us come up with a mechanism for VP3 to connect with PI3P in early endosomes. This constitutes a big step forward in our understanding of how these &quot;<italic>non-canonical</italic>&quot; viruses replicate.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) Even if all the claims were to be clearly supported through major revamping, authors should make the significance of knowing that this protein binds to early endosomes through PI3P more clear?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for the recommendation, which aligns with a similar suggestion from Reviewer #2. In response, we have revised the significance paragraph to emphasize the mechanistic aspects of our findings. Please refer to lines 62–67 in the revised manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) Flotation assay shows binding, but this is not quantitative. An estimate of a Kd would be useful. BLI experiments suggest that half of the binding disappears at 0.5 mM, implying a very low binding affinity.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the reviewer that our biophysical and molecular simulation results suggest a specific but weak interaction of VP3 with PI3P bearing membranes. Indeed, our previous version of the manuscript already contained a paragraph in this regard. Please, see lines 323-332 in the revised version of the manuscript.</p>
<p>From a biological point of view, a low binding affinity of VP3 for the endosomes may constitute an advantage for the virus, in the sense that its traffic through the endosomes may be short lived during its infectious cycle. Indeed, VP3 has been demonstrated to be a &quot;multifunctional&quot; protein involved in several processes of the viral cycle (detailed in lines 84-90), and in our laboratory we have shown that the Golgi complex and the endoplasmic reticulum are organelles where further viral maturation occurs. Taking all of this into account, a high binding affinity of VP3 for endosomes could result in the protein becoming trapped on the endosomal membrane, potentially hindering the progression of the viral infection within the host cell.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) There are some major internal inconsistencies in the data: Figure 1B quantifies VP3-FL T/B ratio ~4 (which appears inconsistent with the image shown, as the T lanes are much lighter than the B) whereas apparently the same experiment in Figure 1G shows it to be ~0.6. With the error bars shown, these results would appear dramatically different from each other, despite supposedly measuring the same thing. The same issue with the FYVE domain between Figures 1A and 4A.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the reviewer’s comment, as it made us aware of an error in Figure 1B. There, the mean value for the VP3-FL Ts/B ratio is 3.0786 for liposomes PI3P(+) and 0.4553 for liposomes PI3P(-) (Please, see the new bar graph on Figure 1B). This may have occurred because, due to the significance of these experiments, we performed multiple rounds of quantification in search of the most suitable procedure for our observations, leading to a mix-up of data sets. Anyway, it’s possible that these corrected values still seem inconsistent given that T lanes are much lighter than the B for VP3-FL in the image shown. Flotation assays are quite labor-intensive and, at least in our experience, yield fairly variable results in terms of quantification. To illustrate this point, the following image shows the three experiments conducted for Figure 1B, where it is clear that, despite producing visually distinct images, all three yielded the same qualitative observation. For Figure 1B, we chose to present the results from experiment #2. However, all three experiments contributed to a Ts/B ratio of 3.0786 for His-VP3 FL, which may account for the apparent inconsistency when focusing solely on the image in Figure 1B.</p>

<p>We acknowledge that, at first glance, some inconsistencies may appear in the results, and we have thoroughly discussed the best approach for quantification. However, we believe the observations are robust in terms of reproducibility and reliable, as the VP3-PI3P interaction was consistently validated by comparison with liposomes lacking PI3P, where no binding was observed.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) Comparison of PA (or PI) to PI3P at the same molar concentration is inappropriate because PI3P has at least double charge. The more interesting question about specificity would be whether PI45P2 (or even better PI35P2) binds or not. Without this comparison, no claim to specificity can be made.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>For us, &quot;specificity&quot; refers to the requirement of a phosphoinositide in the endosomal membrane for VP3 binding. Phosphoinositides have a conspicuous distribution among cellular compartments, and knowing that VP3 associates with early endosomes, our specificity assays aimed to demonstrate that PI3P is strictly required for the binding of VP3. To validate this, we used PI (lacking the phosphate group) and PA (lacking the inositol group) despite their similar charges. In spite of the potential chemical interactions between VP3 and various phosphoinositides, our experimental results suggest that the virus specifically targets endosomal membranes by binding to PI3P, a phosphoinositide present only in early endosomes.</p>
<p>That said, we agree with the reviewer’s point and consider adequate to smooth our specificity claim in the manuscript as follows: “We observed that His-VP3 FL bound to liposomes PI3P(+), but not to liposomes PA or PI, reinforcing the notion that a phosphoinositide is required since neither a single negative charge nor an inositol ring are sufficient to promote VP3 binding to liposomes (SI Appendix, Fig. S2)” (Lines 136-139).</p>

<p>(6) In the EM images, many of the gold beads are inside the vesicles. How do they cross the membranes?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>They do not cross the membrane. Our EM images are two-dimensional projections, meaning that the gold particles located on top or beneath the plane appear to be inside the liposome.</p>

<p>(7) Images in Figure 2D are very low quality and do not show the claimed difference between any of the mutants. All red signal looks basically cytosolic in all images. It is not clear what criteria were used for the quantification in Figure 2E. The same issue is in Figure 2E, where no red WT puncta are observable at all. Consistently, there is minimal colocalization in the quantification in Figure S3, which appears to show no significant differences between any of the mutants, in direct contradiction to the claim in the manuscript.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We apologize for the poor quality of panels in Figures 2D and 2E. Unfortunately, this was due to the PDF conversion of the original files. Please, check the high-quality version of Figure 2. As suggested by reviewers #2 and #3, we have incorporated zoomed panels, which help the reader to better see the differences in distribution.</p>
<p>As mentioned in the legend to Figure 2, the quantification in Figure 2D was performed by calculating the percentage of cells with punctuated fluorescent red signal (showing VP3 distribution) for each protein. The data were then normalized to the P2 WT protein, which is the VP3 wild type.</p>
<p>Figure S3 certainly shows a tendency which positively correlates with the results shown in Figure 3, where we used FYVE to detect PI3P on endosomes and observed significantly less co-localization when VP3 bears its P2 region all reversed or lacks the R<sub>200</sub></p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(8) The only significant differences in colocalization are in Figure 3B, whose images look rather dramatically different from the rest of the manuscript, leading to some concern about repeatability. Also, it is unclear how colocalization is quantified, but this number typically cannot be above 1. Finally, it is unclear what is being colocalized here: with three fluorescent components, there are 3 possible binary colocalizations and an additional ternary colocalization.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out those aspects related to Figure 3. The experiments performed for Figure 3B were conducted by a collaborator abroad handling the purified GST-2xFYVE, which recognizes endogenous PI3P, while the rest of the cell biology experiments were conducted in our laboratory in Argentina. This is why they are aesthetically different. We have made an effort in homogenizing the way they look for the revised version of the manuscript. Please, see the new version of Figure 3.</p>
<p>For quantification of the co-localization of VP3 and EGFP-2xFYVE (Figure 3A), the Manders M2 coefficient was calculated out of approximately 30 cells per construct and experiment. The M2 coefficient, which reflects co-localization of signals, is defined as the ratio of the total intensities of magenta image pixels for which the intensity in the blue channel is above zero to the total intensity in the magenta channel. JACoP plugin was utilized to determine M2. For VP3 puncta co-distributing with EEA1 and GST-FYVE (Figure 3B), the number of puncta co-distributing for the three signals was manually determined out of approximately 40 cells per construct and experiment per 200 µm². We understand that Manders or Pearson coefficients, typically ranging between 0 and 1, is the most commonly used method to quantify co-localizing immunofluorescent signals; however, this “manual” method has been used and validated in previous published manuscripts [Figures 3 and 7 from (Morel et al., 2013); Figure 7 in (Khaldoun et al., 2014); and Figure 4 in (Boukhalfa et al., 2021)].</p>

<p>(9) SegA/B plasmids are not introduced, and it is not clear what these are or how this assay is meant to work. Where are the foci forming units in the images of Figure 4C? How does this inform on replication? Again, this assay is not quantitative, which is essential here: does the R<sub>200</sub> mutant completely kill activity (whatever that is here)? Or reduce it somewhat?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We apologize for the missing information. Segments A and B are basically the components of the IBDV reverse genetics system. For their construction, we used a modification of the system described by Qi and coworkers (Qi et al., 2007), in which the full length sequences of the IBDV RNA segments A and B, flanked by a hammerhead ribozyme at the 5’-end and the hepatitis delta ribozyme at the 3’-end, were expressed under the control of an RNA polymerase II promoter within the plasmids pCAGEN.Hmz.SegA.Hdz (SegA) and pCAGEN.Hmz.SegB.Hdz (SegB). For this specific experiment we generated a third plasmid, pCAGEN.Hmz.SegA.R<sub>200</sub>D.Hdz (SegA.R<sub>200</sub>D), harboring a mutant version of segment A cDNA containing the R<sub>200</sub>D substitution. Then, QM7 cells were transfected with the plasmids SegA, SegB or Seg.R<sub>200</sub>D alone (as controls) or with a mixture of plasmids SegA+SegB (wild type situation) or SegA.R<sub>200</sub>D+SegB (mutant situation). At 8 h post transfection (p.t.), when the new viruses have been able to assemble starting from the two segments of RNA, the cells were recovered and re-plated onto fresh non-transfected cells for revealing the presence (or not) of infective viruses. At 72 h post-plating, the generation of foci forming units (FFUs) was revealed by Coomassie staining. As expected, single-transfections of SegA, SegB or Seg.R<sub>200</sub>D did not produce FFUs and, as shown in Figure 4C, the transfection of SegA+SegB produced detectable FFUs (the three circles in the upper panel) while no FFUs (the three circles in the lower panel) were detected after the transfection of SegA.R<sub>200</sub>D+SegB (Figure 4C). This system is quantitative, since the FFUs detected 72 h post-plating are quantifiable by simply counting the FFUs. However, since no FFUs were detected after the transfection of SegA.R<sub>200</sub>D+SegB, evidenced by a complete monolayer of cells stained blue, we did not find any sense in quantifying. In turn, this drastic observation indicates that viruses bearing the VP3 R<sub>200</sub>D mutation lose their replication ability (is “dead”), demonstrating its crucial role in the infectious cycle.</p>

<p>(11) There is minimal evidence for the sequential binding model described in the abstract. The simulations do not resolve this model, nor is truly specific PI3P binding shown.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In response to your concerns, we would like to emphasize that our simulations provide robust evidence supporting the two more important aspects of the sequential binding model: 1) Membrane Approach: In all simulations, VP3 consistently approaches the membrane via its positively charged C-terminal (Ct) region. 2) PI3P Recruitment: Once the protein is positioned flat on the membrane surface, PI3P is unequivocally recruited to the positively charged P2 region. The enrichment of PI3P in the proximity to the protein is clearly observed and has been quantified via radial distribution functions, as detailed in the manuscript and supplementary material.</p>
<p>While we understand that opinions may vary on the sufficiency of the data to fully validate the model, we believe the results offer meaningful insights into the proposed binding mechanism. That said, we acknowledge that the specificity of VP3 binding may not be restricted solely to PI3P but could extend to phosphoinositides in general. To address this, we performed the new set of co-flotation experiments which are discussed in detail in our response to point 5.</p>

<p>(12) Line 194: Is it alternatively possible that the R<sub>200</sub>D mutant lost its capacity to dimerize, and that in turn impacted PI3P interaction?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks for the relevant question. VP3 was crystallized and its structure reported in (Casañas et al., 2008) (DOI: 10.1016/j.str.2007.10.023). In that report, the authors showed that the two VP3 subunits associate in a symmetrical manner by using the crystallographic two-fold axes. Each subunit contributes with its 30% of the total surface to form the dimer, with 81 interprotomeric close contacts, including polar bonds and van der Waals contacts. The authors identified the group of residues involved in these interactions, among which the R<sub>200</sub> is not included. Addittionally, the authors determined that the interface of the VP3 dimer in crystals is biologically meaningful (not due to the crystal packing).</p>
<p>To confirm that the lack of binding was not due to misfolding of the mutant, we compared the circular dichroism spectra of mutant and wild type proteins, without detecting significant differences (shown in Figure 4B). These observations do not exclude the possibility mentioned by the reviewer, but constitute solid evidences, we believe, to validate our observations.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks for pointing this out. We first observed that in infected cell, all the components of the RNPs [VP3, VP1 (the viral polymerase) and the dsRNA] were associated to the endosomes. Since by this moment it had been already elucidated that VP3 &quot;wrapped&quot; de dsRNA within the RNPs (Luque et al., 2009) (DOI: 10.1016/j.jmb.2008.11.029), we sought that VP3 was most probably leading this association. We answered yes after studying its distribution, also endosome-associated, when ectopically expressed. These results were published in (Delgui et al., 2013) (DOI: 10.1128/jvi.03152-12).</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>As already mentioned, liposome-based methods, such as the co-flotation assay, are well-established and widely regarded as the preferred approach for studying protein-phosphoinositide interactions. However, this approach is rather qualitative, as density gradient separation reveals whether the protein is located in the top fractions (bound to liposomes) or the bottom fractions (unbound). Our quantifications aim to demonstrate differences in the bound fraction between liposome populations with and without PI3P. Given the setting of the co-flotation assays, each protein-liposome system [2xFYVE-PI3P(-), 2xFYVE-PI3P(+), VP3-PI3P(-), or VP3-PI3P(+)] is assessed separately, and even if the conditions are homogeneous, it’s not surprising to observe differences in the protein level between each one.

<p>(8) PIP3 antagonist drugs should be used to further substantiate the results. If PIP3 specifically recruits VP3, this interaction should be abolished in the presence of PIP3 drug and VP3 should show a diffused signal.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We certainly agree with this point. These experiments were performed and the results were reported in (Gimenez et al., 2020). Briefly, in that work, we blocked the synthesis of PI3P in QM7 cells in a stable cell line overexpressing VP3, QM7-VP3, with either the pan-PI3Kinase (PI3K) inhibitor LY294002, or the specific class III PI3K Vps34 inhibitor Vps34-IN1. In Figure 4, we showed that 98% of the cells treated with these inhibitors had the biosensor GFP-2FYVE dissociated from EEs, evidencing the depletion of PI3P in EEs (Figure 4A). In QM7-VP3 cells, we showed that the depletion of PI3P by either inhibitor caused the dissociation of VP3 from EEs and the disaggregation of VP3 puncta toward a cytosolic distribution (Figure 4B). Moreover, since this observation was crucial for our hipothesis, these results were further confirmed with an alternative strategy to deplete PI3P in EEs. We employed a system to inducibly hydrolyze endosomal PI3P through rapamycin-induced recruitment of the PI3P-myotubularin 1 (MTM1) to endosomes in cells expressing MTM1 fused to the FK506 binding protein (FKBP) and the rapamycin-binding domain fused to Rab5, using the fluorescent proteins mCherry-FKBP-MTM1 and iRFP-FRB-Rab5, as described in (Hammond et al., 2014). These results, shown in Figures 5, 6 and 7 in the same manuscript, further reinforced the notion that PI3P mediates and is necessary for the association of VP3 protein with EEs.</p>

<p>(9) The authors should show the localization of VP3 in IBDV-infected cells and treat cells with PI3P antagonists. The fact that R<sub>200</sub> is not rescued does not necessarily mean that this is because of the failed interaction with PI3P. As the authors wrote in the discussion: VP3 bears multiple essential roles during the viral life cycle (line 305).</p>

<p>Indeed, after having confirmed that the VP3 lost its localization associated to the endosomes after the treatment of the cells with PI3P antagonists, we demonstrated that depletion of PI3P significantly reduced the production of IBDV progeny. For this aim, we used two approaches, the inhibitor Vps34-IN1 and an siRNA against VPs34. In both cases, we observed a significantly reduced production of IBDV progeny (Figures 9 and 10). Specifically related to the reviewer’s question, the localization of VP3 in IBDV-infected cells and treated with PI3P antagonists was shown and quantified in Figure 9a.</p>

<p>(10) Could you provide adsorption-free energy profiles and MD simulations also for the R<sub>200</sub> mutant?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Following the reviewer’s suggestion, we have added a new figure to the supplementary information (Figure S15). Instead of presenting a full free-energy profile for each protein, we focused on the adsorption free energy (i.e., the minimum of the adsorption free-energy profile) for VP3 ΔNt and its mutants, VP3 ΔNt R<sub>200</sub>D and VP3 ΔNt P2 Mut, as a function of salt concentration. The aim was to compare the adsorption free energy of the three proteins and evaluate the effect of electrostatic forces on it, which become increasingly screened at higher salt concentrations. As shown in the referenced figure, reducing the number of positively charged residues from VP3 ΔNt to VP3 ΔNt P2 Mut systematically weakens the protein’s binding to the membrane. This effect is particularly pronounced at lower salt concentrations, underscoring the importance of electrostatic interactions in the adsorption of the negatively charged VP3 onto the anionic membrane.</p>

<p>(11) Liposome deformations in the presence of VP3 are interesting (Figure 6G), were these also observed in Figure 1C?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Good question. The liposome deformations in the presence of VP3 shown in Figure 6G were a robust observation since, as mentioned, it was detectable in 36% of the liposomes PI3P(+), while they were completely absent in PI3P(-) liposomes. However, and unfortunately, the same deformations were not detectable in experiments performed using gold particles shown in Figure 1C. In this regard, we think that it might be possible that the procedure of gold particles incubation itself, or even the presence of the gold particles in the images, would somehow “mask” the deformations effect.</p>
