<title>Abstract</title><p>Social isolation generally increases aggression but decreases mating competition, resulting in an intricate and ambiguous relationship between social experience, aggression, and reproductive success. In male <italic>Drosophila</italic>, aggression is often characterized by lunging, a frequent and comparatively low-intensity combat behavior. Here, we provide a behavioral paradigm for studying a less frequent but more vigorous fighting form known as tussling. While social enrichment decreases lunging, aligning with past observations, it heightens the more forceful tussling behavior. These two forms of aggression rely on different olfactory receptor neurons, specifically Or67d for lunging and Or47b for tussling. We further identify three pairs of central pC1 neurons that specifically promote tussling. Moreover, shifting from lunging to tussling in socially enriched males is accompanied with better territory control and mating success. Our findings identify distinct sensory and central neurons for two fighting forms and suggest that social experience may shape fighting strategies to optimize reproductive success.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Competition for resources such as territory, food, and mates is crucial for animal survival and reproduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bergman et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Hoffmann and Cacoyianni, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Stockley and Campbell, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Zwarts et al., 2012</xref>). Among diverse competitive strategies, physical combat is a prevalent form of fighting to repel rivals and regulated by both genetic factors and social environment (Chen, 2022; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Zwarts et al., 2012</xref>). Understanding how social experience influences combat behaviors in animals to maximize their survival and reproduction remains a fundamentally important yet inadequately understood question.</p>
<p>In the fruit fly, <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, inter-male aggression includes relative low-intensity fights such as lunging, in which one fly rears up on its hind legs and snaps down onto its opponent, as well as relative high-intensity fights like tussling, where two males tumble over each other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Certel and Kravitz, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Chen et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Hoopfer, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Palavicino-Maggio and Sengupta, 2022</xref>). A recent work showed that lunges are insufficient to establish dominance but mainly serves to maintain social status, while tussling frequence is correlated with dominance establishment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Simon and Heberlein, 2020</xref>). It is noteworthy that the majority of studies focus on the low-intensity lunging behavior, owing to its higher frequency and ease of observation. Substantial studies have identified regulatory genes and the neural circuit underlying the lunging-based aggressive behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Hoopfer, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Kravitz and Fernandez, 2015</xref>). In particular, the male-specific volatile pheromone 11-<italic>cis</italic>-vaccenyl acetate (cVA) acutely promotes lunging behavior via its olfactory receptor Or67d (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Wang and Anderson, 2010</xref>). Interestingly, chronic cVA exposure in socially-enriched males reduces the level of lunging via another olfactory receptor Or65a (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Liu et al., 2011</xref>). Consistently, it has been found that social isolation increases lunging frequency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Palavicino-Maggio and Sengupta, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Yadav et al., 2024</xref>) by altering the expression of genes such as <italic>Cyp6a20</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Wang et al., 2008</xref>), <italic>Drosulfakinin</italic> (<italic>Dsk</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Agrawal et al., 2020</xref>), and <italic>Tachykinin</italic> (<italic>Tk</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Asahina et al., 2014</xref>). Social isolation also increases male aggression in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Matsumoto et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Zelikowsky et al., 2018</xref>) and even in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Ferguson et al., 2005</xref>). In mice, the TK homologue Tachykinin 2 (Tac2) responds to social isolation and promotes inter-male aggressive behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Zelikowsky et al., 2018</xref>). These findings contribute to the consensus that social isolation escalates aggression, whereas social enrichment mitigates it in animal models.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, social enrichment increases male mating success by enhancing the sensitivity of <italic>Or47b</italic>-expressing olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) to fly pheromones common to both sexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Lin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Sethi et al., 2019</xref>). Artificially activating <italic>Or47b</italic> ORNs also improves mating advantage in a competitive assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Dweck et al., 2015</xref>). Group housing and age-dependent juvenile hormone (JH) jointly increase the expression of the male-specific proteins from <italic>fruitless</italic> (<italic>fru<sup>M</sup></italic>), which is a master gene for male courtship behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Peng et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Sato et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Yamamoto and Koganezawa, 2013</xref>), in the <italic>Or47b</italic>-expressing ORNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Hueston et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Sethi et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Zhao et al., 2020</xref>). Notably, courtship levels in single-housed (SH) wild-type males are equal to (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Dankert et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Pan and Baker, 2014</xref>), in some cases, even stronger than those in group-housed (GH) males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Dankert et al., 2009</xref>). In fact, group-housing decreases excitability of the courtship-promoting P1 neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Inagaki et al., 2014</xref>), which express both terminal genes in the sex determination hierarchy, <italic>fru</italic> and <italic>doublesex</italic> (<italic>dsx</italic>). These findings raise a question on how social enrichment, which suppresses lunging-based aggression and does not increase courtship intensity, would facilitate mating competition.</p>
<p>Here, we provide a behavioral paradigm for studying inter-male tussling in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and discover that this infrequent yet intense form of combat is enhanced by social enrichment, while the low-intensity lunging is suppressed by social enrichment. This social enhancement of tussling requires olfactory receptor Or47b, but not Or67d or Or65a. We further identify three pairs of central <italic>dsx</italic>-expressing pC1 neurons that specifically promote tussling. Moreover, we demonstrate that socially enriched males can overcome mating disadvantages associated with aging.</p>

<title>A Paradigm for High-intensity Aggression in <italic>Drosophila</italic></title>
<p>While studying the lunging-based aggression in <italic>Drosophila</italic> using a high-throughput aggression assay based on previously aggression paradigms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Certel and Kravitz, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Wu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Zhou et al., 2008</xref>), we occasionally observed the high-intensity boxing and tussling behavior in male flies as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Chen et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Nilsen et al., 2004</xref>), which are difficult to distinguish and hereafter simply referred to as tussling. We reasoned that the intensity, instead of the frequency, could be decisive for a combat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Simon and Heberlein, 2020</xref>). Thus, although tussling is a less frequent behavior, it could serve a vital function.</p>
<p>To induce a higher level of tussling for further manipulation, we first introduced a fixed live virgin female in the same behavioral chamber for assaying lunging. The female fly was immobilized in the middle of the food, with its head embedded in the food and its body exposed to enhance male competition (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). We found that males that were group-housed for 7 days showed a significantly higher frequency of tussling behavior and reduced latency to tussle in the presence of an embedded virgin female (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). We next compared tussling in male flies of different ages. We observed a significantly higher proportion of 14-day-old males raised in groups that showed tussling behavior during the 2-hour observation period, compared to the 7-day-old males (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). Furthermore, 2-day-old males never displayed tussling behavior. In contrast, 14-day-old males showed a lower level of lunging behavior than 7-day-old males did (<xref rid="fig1s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1-figure supplement 1</xref>). Previous studies have shown that, in addition to mating resources, food quality is another crucial factor affecting aggressive behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Lim et al., 2014</xref>). Therefore, we next assayed tussling behavior in 14-day-old males in the presence of an embedded virgin female with different concentrations of sucrose or yeast in the food during the behavioral test. We found that these males displayed similar levels of tussling behavior with different concentrations of sucrose in the food (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). On the contrary, male tussling intensity increased significantly with higher yeast concentrations such that more than 70% of males displayed this high-intensity fighting behavior (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1D</xref>, see Figure 1-video supplement 1). Taken together, these results provide an efficient behavioral paradigm for the high-intensity tussling behavior and indicate that older males display more tussling but less lunging than younger ones.</p>

<title>Social Enrichment Inhibits Low-intensity Lunging but Enhances High-intensity Tussling</title>
<p>Previous studies have shown that social enrichment inhibits aggressive behaviors, specifically the low-intensity lunging, in male flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Yadav et al., 2024</xref>). Therefore, we wondered whether social enrichment might also inhibit the high-intensity tussling behavior in males. To answer this question, we compared both fighting behaviors in SH and GH 14-day-old males (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). Lunging and tussling events from each group of representative samples were exhibited in raster plots for comparison (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). We scored lunging behavior mainly in the first 10-min of test, due to its relatively higher occurrence, and tussling behavior during the whole 2-hour observational period since males take much longer time to initiate tussling (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>). Interestingly, we found that while SH males performed more frequent lunging behavior in 10 min than GH males did, which is consistent with previous findings, they rarely showed tussling behavior. In contrast, GH males displayed a large number of tussling events within 2 hours (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). Statistical analysis of tussling and lunging behaviors showed that GH males exhibited reduced tussling latency and enhanced tussling frequency, in addition to increased lunging latency and decreased lunging frequency, compared to SH males (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2C-F</xref>). We also quantified the duration of each tussling and lunging events, and found that the average duration of individual lunging events was less than 0.2 second, while a tussling event lasted from seconds to minutes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2G</xref>). This further suggests that tussling is a more intense form of aggressive behavior compared to lunging. These results indicate that social enrichment inhibits low-intensity lunging but promotes high-intensity tussling in male flies.</p>

<title><italic>Or47b</italic> ORNs Mediate Social Experience-induced Tussling Behavior</title>
<p>To further investigate the sensory basis underlying the opposite regulation of lunging and tussling behaviors by social experience, we tried to examine the role of cVA-sensitive neurons, as well as other <italic>fru<sup>M</sup></italic>-expressing ORNs, in mediating intermale aggression. Two cVA sensory neurons, <italic>Or67d</italic> and <italic>Or65a</italic> ORNs, play crucial roles in enhancing the lunging-based aggression in SH males, in which <italic>Or67d</italic> ORNs mediate acute cVA stimulation and promote male aggression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Wang and Anderson, 2010</xref>), while <italic>Or65a</italic> ORNs mediate chronic cVA stimulation and inhibit male aggression in GH males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Liu et al., 2011</xref>). In addition, the <italic>fru<sup>M</sup></italic>-expressing <italic>Or47b</italic> ORNs are sensitive to a class of pheromones common to both sexes, such as palmitoleic acid (PA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Lin et al., 2016</xref>), and their sensitivity is enhanced under group rearing conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Sethi et al., 2019</xref>). <italic>Ir84a</italic> ORNs, which are also <italic>fru<sup>M</sup></italic>-positive, are involved in the perception of mixed food odors and promote male courtship behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Grosjean et al., 2011</xref>). We silenced <italic>Or67d</italic>, <italic>Or65a</italic>, <italic>Or47b</italic> or <italic>Ir84a</italic> ORNs by expressing the inwardly rectifying potassium channel Kir2.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Baines et al., 2001</xref>) and assayed lunging and tussling behaviors in 14-day-old GH males. We found that silencing <italic>Or47b</italic> ORNs, but not <italic>Or67d</italic>, <italic>Or65a</italic> or <italic>Ir84a</italic> ORNs, significantly decreased male tussling, compared to the control (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>, B, see <xref rid="tbls1" ref-type="table">Table S1</xref> for detailed genotypes). In contrast, silencing <italic>Or67d</italic> ORNs, but not other ORNs, significantly reduced male lunging (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>, D). These loss-of-function results suggest that <italic>Or47b</italic> ORNs mediate male tussling behavior, whereas <italic>Or67d</italic> ORNs regulate male lunging behavior. To elucidate the potential role of the Or47b receptor in mediating tussling behavior, we knocked down its expression in <italic>Or47b</italic> ORNs using RNA interference (RNAi). Our results showed a significant decrease in male tussling behavior when the Or47b receptor expression was reduced (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>, F), indicating that the functionality of <italic>Or47b</italic> ORNs in tussling is dependent on the Or47b receptor. As previous studies suggested that the male-specific <italic>fru<sup>M</sup></italic> sustains <italic>Or47b</italic> expression in an activity-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Sethi et al., 2019</xref>), we next expressed microRNAs targeting <italic>fru<sup>M</sup></italic> (<italic>UAS-fruMi</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Meissner et al., 2016</xref>) in <italic>Or47b</italic> ORNs and assayed male tussling. The efficiency of <italic>Or47b</italic> and <italic>fru<sup>M</sup></italic> RNAi knockdown was both validated by quantitative PCR (<xref rid="fig3s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 3-figure supplement 1</xref>). We observed a slight increase of tussling latency in <italic>fru<sup>M</sup></italic> knocked-down males, although not significantly different from the control (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>, F), suggesting that Or47b, rather than Fru<sup>M</sup>, plays a more crucial role in mediating male tussling.</p>

<p>To further confirm that the effect of social enrichment on tussling depends on the activity of <italic>Or47b</italic> ORNs, we artificially activated <italic>Or47b</italic> ORNs by expressing the bacterially derived sodium channel (NaChBac) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Ren et al., 2001</xref>) in 14-day-old SH males.

Interestingly, the level of tussling in these SH males with activated <italic>Or47b</italic> ORNs was indistinguishable from that in GH males (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3G</xref>, H). These gain-of-function results indicate that social enrichment acts through <italic>Or47b</italic> ORNs to promote male tussling. Using the trans-Tango technique that labels downstream neurons through ligand-receptor mediated signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Talay et al., 2017</xref>), we found substantially more downstream signals of <italic>Or47b</italic> ORNs in GH males than those in SH males (<xref rid="fig3s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 3-figure supplement 2</xref>), suggesting the involvement of <italic>Or47b</italic> ORNs under social enrichment.</p>

<title>Distinct Central Brain Neurons for Lunging and Tussling</title>
<p>We next set out to identify the central neurons involved in regulating the high-intensity tussling. We found that silencing the mushroom body neurons by expressing an inwardly rectifying potassium channel Kir2.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Baines et al., 2001</xref>) driven by <italic>R19B03-GAL4</italic> did not affect male tussling, suggesting that the experience-dependent tussling behavior is not dependent on the classical learning and memory center. Surprisingly, inactivation of the previously-identified aggression-promoting P1<sup>a</sup> and TK neurons did not affect tussling behavior (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>, B). These results imply that the central circuit for tussling behavior may be distinct from the previously reported aggression circuits. As <italic>dsx</italic>-expressing pC1 neurons, also termed P1 if co-expressing <italic>fru<sup>M</sup></italic>, are crucial for sexual and aggressive behaviors in both males and females, we also silenced two subsets of pC1 neurons (pC1<sup>SS1</sup> and pC1<sup>SS2</sup>), which were sexually dimorphic, and their functions were previously characterized in females but not in males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Wang et al., 2021</xref>). We found that inactivation of pC1<sup>SS2</sup> but not pC1<sup>SS1</sup> neurons significantly reduced the tussling behavior in male flies (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>, B). The cell bodies of pC1<sup>SS2</sup> and P1<sup>a</sup> neurons are both located in the center of posterior brain and project to overlapping but distinct parts of the lateral protocerebral complex (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C-E</xref>). These results suggest that pC1<sup>SS2</sup> neurons may be key central neurons regulating tussling behavior.</p>

<p>To further compare the function of P1<sup>a</sup> and pC1<sup>SS2</sup> neurons in regulating male behaviors, we performed optogenetic activation experiments on these neurons expressing <italic>CsChrimson</italic>. Compared to control male pairs that did not show any significant change upon red light stimulation (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F-H</xref>), optogenetic activation of P1<sup>a</sup> neurons induced acute courtship behavior as indicated by unilateral wing extension (UWE), and upon red light removal, there was a significant increase in lunging but not tussling (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4I-K</xref>), consistent with previous findings. In contrast, optogenetic activation of pC1<sup>SS2</sup> neurons induced strong and acute tussling behavior, with more than 50% of the time during red light in tussling, and the tussling behavior ceased immediately upon removal of red light (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4L</xref>, see Figure 4-video supplement 1). Activation of pC1<sup>SS2</sup> neurons did not significantly affect either male lunging or courtship (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4M</xref>, N). These results indicate that pC1<sup>SS2</sup> neurons acutely promote the high-intensity tussling behavior.</p>
<p>Previous studies have revealed a crucial role of P1<sup>a</sup> neurons in promoting a persistent internal state that enhances male aggression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Hoopfer et al., 2015</xref>). To test whether P1<sup>a</sup> neurons can promote both lunging and tussling behaviors, we further performed thermal activation experiments. We found that activation of P1<sup>a</sup> neurons via dTrpA1 at 30°C induced male tussling, just like activation of pC1<sup>SS2</sup> neurons did (<xref rid="fig4s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 4-figure supplement 1</xref>). As thermal activation but not optogenetic activation of P1<sup>a</sup> neurons induced tussling, we reasoned that vision might be a key factor for this discrepancy, since all optogenetic experiments were performed in dark or red light. Thus, we re-performed these thermal activation experiments in dark and found that activation of pC1<sup>SS2</sup> but not P1<sup>a</sup> neurons induced tussling, although the level of tussling by pC1<sup>SS2</sup>-activated males was lower compared to that in light, suggesting a crucial role of vision in male tussling. These optogenetic and themogenetic activation experiments suggest that P1<sup>a</sup> neurons can promote both lunging and tussling behaviors, but their function on tussling requires visual stimulation, while pC1<sup>SS2</sup> neurons play a more direct role in acutely promoting male tussling.</p>
<p>We next used <italic>retro</italic>-Tango (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Sorkaç et al., 2023</xref>) and <italic>trans</italic>-Tango (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Talay et al., 2017</xref>) techniques to explore the potential upstream and downstream circuits of P1<sup>a</sup> and pC1<sup>SS2</sup> neurons, and observed substential differences in both conditions (<xref rid="fig4s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 4-figure supplement 2</xref>), suggesting largely parallel inputs and outputs for P1<sup>a</sup> and pC1<sup>SS2</sup> neurons.</p>

<title>Territory and Mating Advantage in Tussling-favored Experienced Males</title>
<p>As our results showed that GH males and SH males were more likely to perform the low-frequency, high-intensity tussling and the high-frequency, low intensity lunging, respectively, we wondered which fighting strategy might be more practical in the competition for territory and mating resources.</p>
<p>To at least partially address this question, we first designed an experimental paradigm for territory competition (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>). A circular territory, which is provided with food and a fixed virgin female and separated by a wall with a small door open to the outer area, was competed by two tester males, one of which was marked on their wings. We manually analyzed the first 10 winning events, each was defined as one male successfully displacing the other from the inner resource area. The winning index was calculated as the proportional difference in the number of wins between the marked male and unmarked male. In control groups such as two GH males of the same age, we observed some ‘winner takes all’ phenomenon (one male won nearly all of the 10 encounters), but overall, the winning index was close to zero due to the randomness of marking (see methods). We further found that while GH 7-day-old males (G7) won slightly, but not significantly, more than SH 7-day-old males (S7) (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>), older G14 males had a significant advantage over the S14 males (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref> and <xref rid="fig6s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 6-figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref rid="tbls2" ref-type="table">Table S2</xref>, see Figure 6-video supplement 1). Additionally, we observed that when G14 males were paired with S14 males, the proportion of males performing tussling behavior was not significantly different from that between two G14 males. However, the duration of each tussling event in G14 and S14 male pairs was significantly shorter than that between two G14 males (<xref rid="fig6s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 6-figure supplement 2</xref>).</p>

<p>Next, we conducted further investigations into the role of social experience and the two types of fighting behaviors in mating competition (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D</xref>). Two males and one virgin female were loaded into the behavioral chamber at the same time and recorded for courtship behaviors. A winner was defined as the male that first copulated with the female. We used the copulation advance index, which was calculated as the proportional difference between marked males and unmarked males in winning copulation (see methods). We found that G7 males had no significant advantage over S7 males (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6E</xref>); however, G14 males displayed a significantly increased mating advantage over S14 males (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6F</xref>, see Figure 6-video supplement 2). Together, these results suggest that the tussling-favored GH males are more competitive in territory control and mating compared to the lunging-favored SH males, supporting a correlation between tussling and reproductive competetion.</p>
<p>The above results showed that GH males were more competitive compare to SH males, especially in older males, suggesting that social experience may play a potential role in altering age-related mating competition. To test this hypothesis, we first tested mating competition between males of different ages under the same rearing conditions. The results showed that younger males, whether reared in group or isolation, had a greater mating advantage compared to older males (G7 &gt; G14, S7 &gt; S14, G14 &gt; G21, S14 &gt; S21) (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6G</xref>, <xref rid="tbls2" ref-type="table">Table S2</xref>). These results indicate that there is generally a disadvantage in mating competition associated with aging. We next investigated whether the mating advantage induced by social experience could compensate for the mating disadvantage caused by aging. We tested pairs of males with different ages and rearing conditions (G7 vs. S14, S7 vs. G14, G14 vs. S21, S14 vs. G21) for mating competition. We found that while 14-day-old males were less competitive than 7-day-old males regardless of the rearing condition, indicative of the aging-related disadvantage, 21-day-old GH males were significantly more competitive than 14-day-old SH males (G21 &gt; S14) (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6H</xref>).</p>
<p>To further investigate whether the territorial control and mating competition advantage in GH males are related to their high tussling behavior, we paired males with low tussling behavior (<italic>Or47b-GAL4/UAS-Kir2.1</italic> and <italic>pC1<sup>SS2</sup>/UAS-Kir2.1</italic>) with control males for territorial control and mating competition tests. We found that males with inactivated Or47b or pC1<sup>SS2</sup> neurons were incompetitive for both territorial control and mating competition compared to control males (<xref rid="fig6s3" ref-type="fig">Figure 6-figure supplement 3</xref>), further supporting a correlation between the occurrence of tussling behavior and the acquisition of territorial and mating competition advantages.</p>
<p>Taken together, these results indicate that long-term social enrichment in older males increases their territorial and mating competition, which can overcome their mating disadvantage associated with aging (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Regulation of physiology and behavior by social experience is an important feature across animal species. Here, we found that social experience shapes the fighting strategies of male flies, in which GH males tend to reduce the low-intensity lunging and increase the high-intensity tussling. We further showed that the two forms of fighting are mediated by distinct sensory and central neurons. The complex implications of these findings are discussed below.</p>
<p>Previous studies have found that social isolation generally enhances aggression but decreases mating competition in animal models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Palavicino-Maggio and Sengupta, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Sethi et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Yadav et al., 2024</xref>), presenting a paradox between social experience, aggression and reproductive success. Our results provide an explanation for this paradox by dissecting aggressive behaviors into the well-studied, frequently observed lunging behavior and the less frequent but high-intensity tussling behavior. We improved the behavioral paradigm for studying tussling behavior and revealed that social experience oppositely regulates lunging and tussling. It is important to note that the frequency of lunging decreases while the frequency of tussling increases from 7-day-old to 14-day-old males, suggesting a shift in fighting strategy with age. Our results further suggest that social experience may enhance male mating competition by shifting their fighting strategy to the low-frequency, high-intensity tussling, which may be more effective in combat, although direct evidence is still lacking. These results are consistent with a previous study showing a correlation between the establishment of male dominance and tussling behavior, but not lunging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Simon and Heberlein, 2020</xref>). Interestingly, we found that the mating advantage gained through social enrichment can even offset the mating disadvantage associated with aging. Note that a previous study found a mating advantage in 7-day-old males compared to 2-day-old males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Lin et al., 2016</xref>), which may be due to different levels of sexual maturity, but not necessatily reflect the aging effect.</p>
<p>Our results revealed distinct neural circuits underlying the two forms of fighting, spanning from primary sensory neurons to central regulatory neurons. Specifically, silencing the cVA-sensing Or67d neurons reduced male lunging but not tussling, whereas inactivating Or47b neurons impaired male tussling but not lunging. Notably, Or47b neurons respond to pheromones common to both sexes, and the sensitivity of these sensory neurons is enhanced by social enrichment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Lin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Peng et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Sethi et al., 2019</xref>). Unlike the Or67d-dependent lunging, which is primarily male-induced and socially inhibited, the Or47b-dependent tussling is promoted by social enrichment with either male or female flies. Recently, it has been found that female flies increase aggression towards mating pairs or mated females, depending on Or47b and Or67d, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Gaspar et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Wan et al., 2023</xref>). These results suggest a common function of Or47b and Or67d neurons in both sexes for regulating aggression. However, whether these neurons mediate different fighting patterns in females and how they respond to social experience in females remain unknown. According to the FlyWire connectome database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Dorkenwald et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Schlegel et al., 2024</xref>), connecting Or47b and Or67d ORNs to pC1 neurons in females requires at least two intermediate neurons, suggesting a high degree of parallele processings from ORNs to pC1s.</p>
<p>Regarding central regulatory neurons, we identified a novel class of pC1 neurons, pC1<sup>SS2</sup>, that specifically promote male tussling. In male flies, there are ∼60 pairs of <italic>dsx</italic>-expressing pC1 neurons, including the well-characterized P1<sup>a</sup> neurons that also express <italic>fru<sup>M</sup></italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Asahina, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Jiang and Pan, 2022</xref>); however, there are only three pairs of pC1<sup>SS2</sup> neurons that specifically express <italic>dsx</italic> but not <italic>fru<sup>M</sup></italic>, and are crucial for the high-intensity tussling in males. The three pairs of pC1<sup>SS2</sup> neurons may have distinct function from P1<sup>a</sup> neurons in several ways. (1) P1<sup>a</sup> neurons promotes both male courtship and aggression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Hoopfer et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Zhao et al., 2024</xref>), whereas pC1<sup>SS2</sup> neurons specifically promote aggression but not courtship. A recent study also identified pC1<sup>SS2</sup> neurons as aggression-promoting, but their roles in different fighting modes are not depicted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Hindmarsh Sten et al., 2025</xref>). That tussling-promoting pC1<sup>SS2</sup> neurons specifically express <italic>dsx</italic> but not <italic>fru<sup>M</sup></italic> is also consistent with a previous finding that <italic>dsx</italic>-positive pC1 neurons, rather than <italic>fru<sup>M</sup></italic>-positive pC1 neurons, are crucial for male aggression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Koganezawa et al., 2016</xref>). Moreover, the anatomical features of pC1<sup>SS2</sup> neurons are highly similar to the male-specific aggression-promoting (MAP) neurons identified previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Chiu et al., 2021</xref>). (2) P1<sup>a</sup> neurons promotes both lunging and tussling, although their function on tussling requires additional visual stimulation. In contrast, pC1<sup>SS2</sup> neurons specifically promote tussling, and the presence of light enhances but is not absolutely necessary for tussling. These results align with previous findings that visual stimuli amplify P1 activation and related behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Hindmarsh Sten et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Kohatsu and Yamamoto, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Pan et al., 2012</xref>), and visual stimulation is important for male aggression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Duistermars et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Ramin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Schretter et al., 2020</xref>). (3) Male lunging is induced after P1<sup>a</sup> activation; whereas male tussling is induced during pC1<sup>SS2</sup> activation. These results suggest that P1<sup>a</sup> neurons may not directly regulate aggression but instead induce a persistent state that promote aggression in general, while pC1<sup>SS2</sup> neurons may play a more direct role in mediating tussling. Future studies are needed to further dissect the seemingly parallel sensory and central neuronal pathways involved in lunging and tussling, and to explore how these pathways interact during social experience and aging to optimize reproductive success.</p>
<sec id="s3a">
<title>Limitations of the Study</title>
<p>We manually analyzed aggressive behaviors and strived to ensure objectivity in behavioral analysis; however, precisely tracking and quantifying specific occurrences of lunging and tussling events for each fly over extended time periods remained methodologically challenging. Furthermore, tussling events often exhibit prolonged durations, which may also include other forms of aggression such as holding. While our results indicate an association between tussling behavior and reproductive competition, a direct link between them is lacking. Future investigations are needed to establish a causal relationship between fighting strategies and reproductive success.</p>

<title>Male aggression assay</title>
<p>For the aggression assays presented in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>, the prepared food was evenly spread into the center of behavioral chambers. There was no female in the traditional paradigm (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>, left) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Wu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Zhou et al., 2008</xref>), while a 3-5 day old virgin female was gently fixed in the center of the food with its abdomen outside in the modified paradigm (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>, right). We used a fixed female to restrict its position in the center of food. Then two male testers were placed into the upper chambers separated from the food (with or without a fixed female) by a film barrier. All testers were loaded by cold anesthesia. After a 30-minute adaptation, the film was gently removed to allow the two males to fall into the behavioral chamber, and the aggressive behavior was recorded for 2 hours. The aggression assays in <xref rid="fig1s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1-figure supplement 1</xref> was performed by using the paradigm without female, while other data were acquired using the modified paradigm with a fixed female unless otherwise stated. In some experiments, both single-housed and group-housed (30-40 males per vial) males were assayed for comparison.</p>
<p>We manually analyzed lunging and tussling behaviors in this study. Lunging is characterized by a male raising its forelegs and quickly striking the opponent, and each lunge typically lasts less than 0.2 seconds through detailed slow-motion analysis. Tussling is characterized by both males using their forelegs and bodies to tumble over each other, and this behavior may last from seconds to minutes. Tussling is often mixed with boxing, in which both flies rear up and strike the opponent with forelegs. Since boxing is often transient and difficult to distinguish from tussling, we referred to the mixed boxing and tussling behavior simply as tussling. As we manually analyze tussling for 2 hours for each pair of males, it is possible that we may miss some tussling events, especially those quick ones.</p>
<p>For the quantification of lunge latency and frequency in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2E</xref>, 2F, 3C, 3D, and <xref rid="fig1s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1-figures supplement 1A</xref>, 1B, we manually analyzed the videos and defined the lunge latency as the time point at which the first lunging event occurred between the two male flies after the start of the recording. We then counted the number of lunge events occurring within 10 minutes after the first lunge. For the quantification of tussle latency and frequency in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1B</xref>, 1C, 1D, 2C, 2D, 3A, 3B, 3E, 3F, 3G, 3H, 4A and 4B, we manually analyzed the videos and defined the tussle latency as the time point at which the first tussling event occurred between the two male flies after the start of the recording. We defined the tussle frequency (No. of tussles in 2 hr) as the total number of tussling events that occurred within two hours from the beginning of the video.</p>

<p>For optogenetic activation assay showed in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref> and 5, males were raised at 25°C on standard fly food, collected after eclosion and housed in the dark for 5-7 days on food containing 0.4 mM all <italic>trans</italic>-Retinal (MFCD00001550, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). The specific light stimulation protocols are showed in the schematic (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>). In brief, Two 5-7 days old males were loaded into the circular chamber (d=10mm) under freeze anesthesia and separated with a transparent film in the dark. Then the chamber was moved on the plane light source (IR channel: 865nm, red-light channel: 630nm) for 15 mins adaptation. Before video recording, the IR light channel was switched on and adjusted to the appropriate intensty for recording. The film was removed before the recording start, with the red-light channel switched on (constant red light, 0.02 mW/mm<sup>2</sup>) during the 2nd and 5th minutes of the experiment. The statistics for the tussling, lunging, and unilateral wing extension (UWE) are as follows. For tussling time and UWE time, we used LifesongY software (website: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/lifesongy/">https://sourceforge.net/projects/lifesongy/</ext-link>), which is written by Dr. Chao Guo based on LifesongX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bernstein et al., 1992</xref>), to calculate the percentage of the total time these behaviors occurred per minute. Specifically, the &quot;tussling time (%)&quot; refers to the percentage of time during the observation period in which tussling behavior occurred, relative to the total observation time. Similarly, &quot;UWE time (%)&quot; represents the percentage of time during the observation period in which UWE occurred. For lunges, we counted the number of lunging occurrences per minute.</p>

<p>For the territorial competition experiment in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figures 6A-6C</xref>, <xref rid="fig6s3" ref-type="fig">Figure 6-figure supplement 3A</xref>, the behavioral setup was produced using a 3D printer (Bambu Lab A1), as illustrated in the schematic, with a transparent cover plate placed on the top. The preparation of food and female were the same as the above aggression paradigm. The female was fixed in the center of the food and two male testers were placed separately in the two small chambers on both sides. Before initiating the experiment, the two barriers were closed. After a 30-minute adaptation, the barriers were opened to allow the males access to the central large chamber, and were closed once the males went inside, and the territorial behavior was recorded for 2 hours. The first 10 encounters occurring after 1 hour of recording were used for statistical analysis. The winning event was defined as a male driving the other male out of the food area. To discriminate between tester males, about half of them were marked on one of their wings using a red maker pen 24 hours before the experiment. For expreiments using males with different ages and/or housing conditions, we calculated the winning index as (num. of wins by males [upper panel] – num. of wins by males [lower panel])/10 encounters * 100%. For control expreiments using males of the same age and housing condition, we calculated the winning index as (num. of wins by unmarked males – num. of wins by marked males)/10 encounters * 100%, which is roughly zero due to the randomness of marking.</p>

After 30 minutes adaptation, two films were removed to allow the three flies to interact, and the behavior was recorded for 1 hour. The chambers without successful copulation during the 1-hour period were excluded from further analysis. For each condition, we used 120 efficient chambers with 10 random chambers collectively as one sample. For expreiments using males with different ages and/or housing conditions, the copulation advance index was defined as (num. of male winners [upper panel] – num. of male winners [lower panel])/10 chambers * 100%. For control expreiments using males of the same age and housing condition, the copulation advance index was calculated as (num. of winners by unmarked males – num. of winners by marked males)/10 chambers * 100%, which is roughly zero due to the randomness of marking.

<p>This work addresses an important question in the field of Drosophila aggression and mating. Prior social isolation is known to increase aggression in males, manifesting as increased lunging, which is suppressed by group housing (GH). However, it is also known that single housed (SH) males, despite their higher attempts to court females, are less successful. Here, Gao et al., develop a modified aggression assay to address this issue by recording aggression in Drosophila males for 2 hours, with a virgin female immobilized by burying its head in the food. They found that while SH males frequently lunge in this assay, GH males switch to higher intensity but very low frequency tussling. Constitutive neuronal silencing and activation experiments implicate cVA sensing Or67d neurons in promoting high frequency lunging, similar to earlier studies, whereas Or47b neurons promote low frequency but higher intensity tussling. Optogenetic activation revealed that three pairs of pC1SS2 neurons increase tussling. Cell-type-specific DsxM manipulations combined with morphological analysis of pC1SS2 neurons and side-by-side tussling quantification link the developmental role of DsxM to the functional output of these aggression-promoting cells. In contrast, although optogenetic activation of P1a neurons in the dark did not increase tussling, thermogenetic activation under visible light drove aggressive tussling. Using a further modified aggression assay, GH males exhibit increased tussling and maintain territorial control, which could contribute to a mating advantage over SH males, although direct measures of reproductive success are still needed</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Through a series of clever neurogenetic and behavioral approaches, the authors implicate specific subsets of ORNs and pC1 neurons in promoting distinct forms of aggressive behavior, particularly tussling. They have devised a refined territorial control paradigm, which appears more robust than earlier assays. This new setup is relatively clutter-free and could be amenable to future automation using computer vision approaches. The updated Figure 5, which combines cell-type-specific developmental manipulation of pC1SS2 neurons with behavioral output, provides a link between developmental mechanisms and functional aggression circuits. The manuscript is generally well written, and the claims are largely supported by the data.</p>
<p>Weakness:</p>
<p>All prior concerns have been addressed in the revised manuscript. The added 'Limitations of the study' section is a welcome and important clarification. Despite these limitations, the study provides valuable insights into the neural and behavioral mechanisms of Drosophila aggression.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Gao et al. investigated the change of aggression strategies by the social experience and its possible biological significance by using Drosophila. Two modes of inter-male aggression in Drosophila are known: lunging, high-frequency but weak mode, and tussling, low-frequency but more vigorous mode. Previous studies have mainly focused on the lunging. In this paper, the authors developed a new behavioral experiment system for observing tussling behavior and found that tussling is enhanced by group rearing, while lunging is suppressed. They then searched for neurons involved in the generation of tussling. Although olfactory receptors named Or67d and Or65a have previously been reported to function in the control of lunging, the authors found that these neurons do not function in the execution of tussling and another olfactory receptor, Or47b, is required for tussling, as shown by the inhibition of neuronal activity and the gene knockdown experiments. Further optogenetic experiments identified a small number of central neurons pC1[SS2] that induce the tussling specifically. These neurons express doublesex (dsx), a sex-determination factor, and knockdown of dsx strongly suppresses the induction of tussling. In order to further explore the ecological significance of the aggression mode change in group-rearing, a new behavioral experiment was performed to examine the territorial control and the mating competition. And finally, the authors found that differences in the social experience (group vs. solitary rearing) are important in these biologically significant competitions. These results add a new perspective to the study of aggression behavior in Drosophila. Furthermore, this study discusses an interesting general model in which the social experience modified behavioral changes play a role in reproductive success.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>A behavioral experiment system that allows stable observation of tussling, which could not be easily analyzed due to its low-frequency, would be very useful. The experimental setup itself is relatively simple, just addition of a female to the platform, so it should be applicable to future research. The finding about the relationship between the social experience and the aggression mode change is quite novel. Although the intensity of aggression changes with the social experience was already reported in several papers (Liu et al., 2011 etc), the fact that the behavioral mode itself changes significantly has rarely been addressed, and is extremely interesting. The identification of sensory and central neurons required for the tussling makes appropriate use of the genetic tools and the results are clear. A major strength of this study in the neurobiology is the finding that another group of neurons (Or47b-expressing olfactory neurons and pC1[SS2] neurons), distinct from the group of neurons previously thought to be involved in low-intensity aggression (i.e. lunging), function in the tussling behavior. Furthermore, the results showing that the regulation of aggression by pC1[SS2] neurons is based the function of the dsx gene will bring a new perspective to the field. Further investigation of the detailed circuit analysis is expected to elucidate the neural substrate of the conflicting between the two aggression modes. The experimental systems examining the territory control and the reproductive competition in Fig. 6 are novel and have advantages in exploring their biological significance. It is important to note that, in addition to showing the effects of age and social experience on territorial and mating behaviors, the authors suggested that an altered fighting strategy has effects with respect to these behaviors.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>New experimental paradigm in Fig. 6 is quite useful, but as the authors mentioned, still the future investigations are needed to reveal a direct relationship between aggression strategies and reproductive success.</p>

<p>Weakness:</p>
<p>Although most concerns have been addressed, the manuscript still lacks a rigorous, objective method for quantifying lunging and tussling. Because scoring appears to have been done manually and a single lunge in a 30 fps video spans only 2-3 frames, the 0.2 s cutoff seems arbitrary, and there are no objective criteria distinguishing reciprocal lunging from tussling. Despite this, the study offers valuable insights into the neural and behavioral mechanisms of Drosophila aggression.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for this comment. The duration of each lunge was measured by analyzing the videos frame by frame—from the frame before the initiation of the lunge to the frame after its completion—resulting in an average span of 3–5 frames. Given a frame rate of 30 fps, this corresponds to approximately 0.1–0.17 seconds. We acknowledge that there are certain limitations for manually quantifying the two types of aggressive behaviors, which has now been stated in the newly added “Limitations of the Study” section in the revised manuscript.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Gao et al. investigated the change of aggression strategies by the social experience and its biological significance by using Drosophila. Two modes of inter-male aggression in Drosophila are known: lunging, high-frequency but weak mode, and tussling, low-frequency but more vigorous mode. Previous studies have mainly focused on the lunging. In this paper, the authors developed a new behavioral experiment system for observing tussling behavior and found that tussling is enhanced by group rearing, while lunging is suppressed. They then searched for neurons involved in the generation of tussling. Although olfactory receptors named Or67d and Or65a have previously been reported to function in the control of lunging, the authors found that these neurons do not function in the execution of tussling and another olfactory receptor, Or47b, is required for tussling, as shown by the inhibition of neuronal activity and the gene knockdown experiments. Further optogenetic experiments identified a small number of central neurons pC1[SS2] that induce the tussling specifically. These neurons express doublesex (dsx), a sex-determination factor, and knockdown of dsx strongly suppresses the induction of tussling. In order to further explore the ecological significance of the aggression mode change in group-rearing, a new behavioral experiment was performed to examine the territorial control and the mating competition. And finally, the authors found that differences in the social experience (group vs. solitary rearing) and the associated change in aggression strategy are important in these biologically significant competitions. These results add a new perspective to the study of aggression behavior in Drosophila. Furthermore, this study proposes an interesting general model in which the social experience modified behavioral changes play a role in reproductive success.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>A behavioral experiment system that allows stable observation of tussling, which could not be easily analyzed due to its low-frequency, would be very useful. The experimental setup itself is relatively simple, just the addition of a female to the platform, so it should be applicable to future research. The finding about the relationship between the social experience and the aggression mode change is quite novel. Although the intensity of aggression changes with the social experience was already reported in several papers (Liu et al., 2011 etc), the fact that the behavioral mode itself changes significantly has rarely been addressed, and is extremely interesting. The identification of sensory and central neurons required for the tussling makes appropriate use of the genetic tools and the results are clear. A major strength of this study in neurobiology is the finding that another group of neurons (Or47b-expressing olfactory neurons and pC1[SS2] neurons), distinct from the group of neurons previously thought to be involved in low-intensity aggression (i.e. lunging), function in the tussling behavior. Furthermore, the results showing that the regulation of aggression by pC1[SS2] neurons is based on the function of the dsx gene will bring a new perspective to the field. Further investigation of the detailed circuit analysis is expected to elucidate the neural substrate of the conflict between the two aggression modes. The experimental systems examining the territory control and the reproductive competition in Fig. 6 are novel and have advantages in exploring their biological significance. It is important to note that in addition to showing the effects of age and social experience on territorial and mating behaviors, the authors experimentally demonstrated that altered fighting strategy has effects with respect to these behaviors.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>In this revised manuscript, Gao et al. presented a series of well-controlled behavioral data showing that tussling, a form of high-intensity fighting among male fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster) is enhanced specifically among socially experienced and relatively old males. Moreover, results of behavioral assays led authors to suggest that increased tussling among socially experienced males may increase mating success. They also concluded that tussling is controlled by a class of olfactory sensory neurons and sexually dimorphic central neurons that are distinct from pathways known to control lunges, a common male-type attack behavior.</p>
<p>A major strength of this work is that it is the first attempt to characterize behavioral function and neural circuit associated with Drosophila tussling. Many animal species use both low-intensity and high-intensity tactics to resolve conflicts. High-intensity tactics are mostly reserved for escalated fights, which are relatively rare. Because of this, tussling in the flies, like high-intensity fights in other animal species, have not been systematically investigated. Previous studies on fly aggressive behavior have often used socially isolated, relatively young flies within a short observation duration. Their discovery that 1) older (14-days old) flies tend to tussle more often than younger (2 to 7-days-old) flies, 2) group-reared flies tend to tussle more often than socially isolated flies, and 3) flies tend to tussle at later stage (mostly ~15 minutes after the onset of fighting), are the result of their creativity to look outside of conventional experimental settings. These new findings are key for quantitatively characterizing this interesting yet under-studied behavior.</p>
<p>Newly presented data have made several conclusions convincing. Detailed descriptions of methods to quantify behaviors help understand the basis of their claims by improving transparency. However, I remain concerned about authors' persistent attempt to link the high intensity aggression to reproductive success. The authors' effort to &quot;tone down&quot; the link between the two phenomena remains insufficient. There are purely correlational. I reiterate this issue because the overall value of the manuscript would not change with or without this claim.</p>

<p>Thank you for acknowledging the novelty and significance of the study. Regarding the relationship you mentioned between high-intensity aggression and reproductive success, we further toned down the statement between them throughout the manuscript in the revised manuscript. We also modified the title to “Social Experience Shapes Fighting Strategies in Drosophila”. In addition, we now added a ‘Limitations of the Study’ section to clearly state the correlation between tussling and reproductive success.</p>

<p>If possible, mention the EM-connectome data showing the minimal interneuronal path from Or47b ORNs to pC1SS2 neurons (even if derived from the female connectome), which can strengthen the model of parallel sensory-central pathways.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for this comment. According to data from the EM connectome, connecting Or47b ORNs to pC1d neurons requires at least two intermediate neurons. An example minimal pathway is: ORN_VA1v (L) → AL-AST1 (L) → PLP245 (L) → pC1d (R). We have added this point in the Discussion section of the revised manuscript.</p>

<p>I'm not convinced that labeling lunges as &quot;gentle&quot; combat behavior works, either in the abstract or elsewhere. While lunging is indeed a lower-intensity form of aggression compared to tussling, applying anthropomorphic descriptors risks misleading readers.</p>

<p>Thank you. We will continue to explore this part in our future study.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>However, one point still concerns me.</p>
<p>Line 192: Although the authors describe it as &quot;usage-dependent,&quot; the trans-Tango technique is essentially a postsynaptic cell-labeling technique. It is possible that the labeling intensity in postsynaptic cells increases from the change in expression levels of the Or47b gene due to GH. However, there is no difference in the expression level of the Or47b gene labeled by GFP between SH and GH. Therefore, we cannot conclude that the expression of the Or47b gene is increased by rearing conditions.</p>
<p>The original paper on trans-TANGO (Talay et al., 2017) does not discuss the usage-dependency. A review of trans-synaptic labeling techniques (Ni, Front Neural Circuits. 2021) discusses that the increase in trans-TANGO signaling with aging may be related to synaptic strength, but there is no experimental evidence for this. In my opinion, the results in Figure 3-figure supplement 2 only weakly suggest that the increase in trans-TANGO signaling may be explained by an increase in synaptic strength due to group rearing.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the reviewer’s insightful comment regarding the interpretation of the trans-Tango signal. Indeed, the original trans-Tango study (Talay et al., 2017) does not claim that the method is usage-dependent. The observed increase in trans-Tango labeling with age, as reported in their supplemental figures, may reflect accumulation over time, potentially influenced by synaptic maturation or increased component expression. To avoid overstating our results, we have revised the relevant statement in the manuscript to remove the term &quot;usage-dependent&quot; and now describe the change in trans-Tango signal more cautiously.</p>

<p>Some may say that a speculative statement is harmless, but I think it indeed is harmful unless it is clearly indicated as a speculation.

<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>I do not have the same level of concern over the interpretation of Fig. 6A-C, because this is directly linked to aggressive interactions. Even if the socially isolated males do not engage in tussling, it is not a leap to assume that a different fighting tactic of socially experienced males can give them an advantage in defending a territory. To me, this is a sufficient ethological link with the observed behavioral change.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for this insightful comment.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The following are relatively minor, although important, concerns.</p>
<p>I beg to differ over the authors' definition of &quot;tussling&quot;. Supplemental movies S1 and S2 appear to include &quot;tussling&quot; bouts in which 2 flies lunging at each other in rapid succession, and supplemental movie S3 appears to include bouts of &quot;holding&quot;, in which one fly holds the opponent's wings and shakes vigorously. These cases suggest that the definition of &quot;tussling&quot; as opposed to &quot;lunging&quot; has a subjective element. However, I would not delve on this matter further because it is impossible to be completely objective over behavioral classification, even by using a computational method. An important point is that the definition is applied consistently within the publication. I have no reason to doubt that this was not the case.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for this comment. Since the analysis of tussling behavior was conducted manually, it is challenging to achieve complete objectivity. However, we made every effort to apply consistent criteria throughout the analysis. We have added a “Limitations of the Study” section in the revised manuscript to clearly state this caveat. We appreciate your understanding.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Authors now state that &quot;all tester flies were loaded by cold anesthesia&quot; (lines 432-433). I would like to draw attention to the well-known fact that anesthesia, whether by ice or by CO2, are long known to affect fly's subsequent behaviors (for aggression, see Trannoy S. et al., Learn. Mem. 2015. 22: 64-68). It will be prudent to acknowledge the possibility that this handling method could have contributed to unusually high levels of spontaneous tussling, which has not been reported elsewhere before.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for this comment. The increased tussling behavior observed in our study is unlikely due to cold anesthesia, as noted by Trannoy S. et al. (2015), cold anesthesia profoundly reduces locomotion and general aggressiveness in flies. We acknowledge that the use of cold anesthesia in behavioral experiments may have potential effects on aggression. To minimize this influence, we allowed the flies to recover and adapt for at least 30 minutes before behavioral recording. Moreover, both control and experimental groups were treated in exactly the same manner to ensure consistency.</p>

<p>It is intriguing that pC1SS2 neurons are dsx+ but fru-. Authors convincingly demonstrated that these neurons are clearly distinct from the P1a neurons, a well-characterized hub for male social behaviors. It is possible that pC1SS2 neurons overlap with previously characterized dsx+ neurons that are important for male aggressions (measured by lunges), such as in Koganezawa et al., Curr. Biol. 2016 and Chiu et al., Cell 2020, a point authors could have explicitly raised.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for this comment. We have added this point into the Discussion section of the revised manuscript, as follows: “That tussling-promoting… aggression (Koganezawa et al., 2016). Moreover, the anatomical features of pC1<sup>SS2</sup> neurons are highly similar to the male-specific aggression-promoting (MAP) neurons identified by another previous study (Chiu et al., 2021).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>I acknowledge the authors' courage to initiate an investigation to a less characterized, high intensity fighting behavior. Tussling requires the simultaneous engagement of two flies. Even if there are confusion over the distinction between lunges and tussling, authors' conclusion that socially experienced flies and socially isolated flies employ distinct fighting strategy is convincing. The concern I raised above is about the interpretation of the data, not about the quality of data.</p>
