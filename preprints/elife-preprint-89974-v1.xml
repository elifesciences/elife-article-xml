<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Cleavage of gasdermin, typically by caspase (CASP), is required for pyroptosis. In human, CASP3 and CASP7 recognize the same consensus motif DxxD, which is present in gasdermin E (GSDME), but only CASP3 cleaves GSDME. The underlying mechanism of this observation is unclear. In this study, we identified a pyroptotic pufferfish GSDME that was specifically cleaved by both pufferfish CASP3/7 and human CASP3/7. Domain swapping between pufferfish and human CASP/GSDME showed that the GSDME C-terminus and the CASP7 p10 subunit determined the cleavability of GSDME by CASP7. p10 contains a key residue that governs CASP7 substrate discrimination. This residue is highly conserved in vertebrate CASP3 and in most vertebrate (except mammalian) CASP7. In mammals, the key residue is conserved in non-primate (e.g., mouse) but not in primate. However, mouse CASP7 cleaved human GSDME but not mouse GSDME. These findings revealed the molecular mechanism of CASP7 substrate discrimination that underlies the evolutionary divergence of CASP3/7-mediated GSDME activation in vertebrate.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Pyroptosis represents a necrotic form of programmed cell death that provokes robust inflammatory immune response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bergsbaken, Fink, &amp; Cookson, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Tsuchiya et al., 2019</xref>). Gasdermin (GSDM) serves as the direct executioner of pyroptosis. GSDM forms transmembrane channels to permeabilize the cytoplasmic membrane, which leads to lytic cell death with massive release of proinflammatory cytokines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Kovacs &amp; Miao, 2017</xref>; J. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Shi, Gao, &amp; Shao, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Xia et al., 2021</xref>). Human has six GSDM family members, GSDMA-F (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Tamura et al., 2007</xref>). All GSDMs (except for GSDMF) adopt a two-domain architecture, the N-terminal (NT) pore-forming domain and the C-terminal (CT) autoinhibitory domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">De Schutter et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Shao, 2021</xref>). Proteolytic cleavage of GSDM to remove the autoinhibitory CT domain enables the binding of the lipophilic NT fragment to the cell membrane, where the NT fragments oligomerize and form transmembrane channels to induce osmotic cell lysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Kuang et al., 2017</xref>; X. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Liu et al., 2016</xref>).</p>
<p>Among the signaling pathways that activate GSDM-mediated pyroptosis, caspase (CASP) 1/4/5/11-mediated GSDMD activation is well documented. In human, GSDMD is specifically cleaved by the inflammatory CASP1 and the closely related CASP4/5 at the FLTD motif within the inter-domain linker region of GSDMD, and the cleavage unleashes the pore-forming GSDMD-NT fragment and triggers pyroptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">He et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Kayagaki et al., 2015</xref>; J. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Shi et al., 2015</xref>). Structural and biochemical analysis reveal that CASP1/4 βIII/βIII’ sheet forms an exosite that interacts with the hydrophobic pocket of GSDMD-CT domain, rendering GSDMD cleavage independent of CASP recognition of the tetrapeptide motif FLTD (K. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Wang et al., 2020</xref>). When the tetrapeptide FLTD is mutated to AAAD, CASP1/4 cleavage of GSDMD is not affected. The residues that form the hydrophobic pocket of GSDMD-CT domain are not conserved in GSDME, suggesting that GSDME cannot be cleaved by CASP1/4 via interaction with an exosite (Z. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Liu et al., 2020</xref>). Actually, human GSDME is specifically cleaved by CASP3 at the consensus motif DMPD, which is required for CASP3-mediated GSDME proteolysis. Mutation of either the Asp residue of the DMPD tetrapeptide motif leads to cleavage resistance of GSDME (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Rogers et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Wang et al., 2017</xref>), indicating that CASP3-mediated GSDME activation paradigm is distinct from that of GSDMD. It is intriguing that although CASP7 shares the same recognition motif (DxxD) with CASP3, CASP7 cannot cleave GSDME (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Agniswamy, Fang, &amp; Weber, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Slee, Adrain, &amp; Martin, 2001</xref>). The molecular mechanism underlying the CASP3/7 cleavage discrimination of GSDME is unknown.</p>
<p>Historically, CASP3 and CASP7, which are 54% identical, are known to possess similar structure and share overlapping protein substrate repertoire, and are considered to have functionally redundant roles in regulating cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Crawford &amp; Wells, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Kumar, 2007</xref>; Y. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Shi, 2002</xref>). Both CASP3 and CASP7 consist of two polypeptide subunits named p20 and p10 (1:1 ratio), which assemble to form active heterotetramer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Timmer &amp; Salvesen, 2007</xref>). CASP3/7 contain highly conserved QACRG and SHG motifs in p20 subunit, and SWR and GSWF motifs in p10 subunit, which participate in the catalytic reaction and substrate binding, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Boyce, Degterev, &amp; Yuan, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Cohen, 1997</xref>). In the apoptosis signaling pathway, death receptor-mediated extrinsic pathway and mitochondria-mediated intrinsic pathway ultimately converge to the activation of CASP3/7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Budd, Tenneti, Lishnak, &amp; Lipton, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Wajant, 2002</xref>). Active CASP3/7 cleave a series of protein substrates, including poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase and DNA fragmentation factor 45, which causes chromatin fragmentation and leads to apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Erener et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Wolf, Schuler, Echeverri, &amp; Green, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Zheng et al., 1998</xref>). Although CASP3 and CASP7 exert almost indistinguishable proteolytic specificity to certain polypeptides, there exist functional differences between these two CASPs in cleaving some substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Brentnall, Rodriguez-Menocal, De Guevara, Cepero, &amp; Boise, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Demon et al., 2009</xref>). For instance, CASP3 cleaves Bid much more efficiently than CASP7, while CASP7 cleaves cochaperone p23 more efficiently than CASP3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Slee et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Walsh et al., 2008</xref>). These findings support the notion that CASP3 and CASP7 are enzymatically similar but functionally non-redundant.</p>
<p>Different from human GSDME that is specifically cleaved by CASP3, teleost GSDME is cleaved via various modes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Angosto-Bazarra et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Yuan, Jiang, Qin, &amp; Sun, 2022</xref>). In this study, we identified a functional GSDME (named TrGSDME) from pufferfish <italic>Takifugu rubripes</italic>. We found that TrGSDME was specifically cleaved by both human and pufferfish CASP3/7, whereas human GSDME was cleaved by pufferfish CASP3/7 and human CASP3, but not by human CASP7. We examined the underlying mechanism of this observation. We found that the GSDME-CT and the CASP7 p10 were critical for CASP7 cleavage of GSDME. By a series of site-directed mutagenesis, we discovered a previously unrecognized molecular determinant in p10 that was responsible for the discriminative cleavage of GSDME by CASP3/7.</p>

<title>Pufferfish GSDME is specifically cleaved by both human and fish CASP3/7</title>
<p>It has long been observed that although human caspase (HsCASP) 3 and 7 share the same consensus recognition motif DxxD, HsCASP3, but not HsCASP7, cleaves human GSDME (HsGSDME) (at the site of DMPD). The underlying molecular mechanism is unknown. In this study, we found that pufferfish <italic>Takifugu rubripes</italic> GSDME (designated TrGSDME) was specifically cleaved by both HsCASP3 and 7 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A and B</xref>). This intriguing observation promoted us to explore the mechanism of CASP7 substrate discrimination. We first examined whether TrGSDME could be cleaved by pufferfish CASP (TrCASP) 3/7. The active forms of TrCASP3/7 were prepared (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>), both exhibited high proteolytic specificity and activity towards the tetrapeptide DEVD (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D and E</xref>), which is the conserved recognition motif of human CASP3/7. When incubated with TrGSDME, both TrCASP3 and TrCASP7 cleaved TrGSDME into the NT and CT fragments, similar to that cleaved by HsCASP3/7, in a dose dependent manner (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F and G</xref>). Accordingly, TrCASP3/7-mediated TrGSDME cleavage was inhibited by the CASP3 inhibitor (Z-DEVD-FMK) and the pan-CASP inhibitor (Z-VAD-FMK) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1H</xref>). Based on the molecular mass of the cleaved NT and CT products, we inferred that the tetrapeptide motif <sup>255</sup>DAVD<sup>258</sup> in the vicinity of the linker region of TrGSDME may be the recognition site of CASP3/7. Indeed, the D255R and D258A mutants of TrGSDME were resistant to TrCASP3/7 cleavage (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1I and J</xref>). Taken together, these results demonstrated that TrGSDME was cleaved by fish and human CASP3/7 in a manner that depended on the specific sequence of DAVD (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1K</xref>).</p>

<title>CASP3/7-cleaved TrGSDME is functionally activated and induces pyroptosis</title>
<p>We next examined whether TrGSDME, like HsGSDME, is a functional pyroptosis inducer. For this purpose, HEK293T cells were transfected with mCherry-tagged full length (FL) or NT/CT domain of TrGSDME. Microscopy revealed that TrGSDME-FL and -CT were abundantly expressed in the cells, whereas TrGSDME-NT expression was barely detectable (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). No significant morphological change or LDH release was observed in cells expressing TrGSDME-FL or -CT (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B and C</xref>). By contrast, cells expressing TrGSDME-NT showed necrotic cell death with massive LDH release (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B and C</xref>). TrGSDME-NT-induced cell death exhibited osmotic cell membrane swelling, a typical feature of pyroptosis (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>). Time-lapse imaging showed that TrGSDME-NT triggered rapid cell swelling and membrane rupture, which led to release of cytoplasmic contents and eventually cell death (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref>, Movie S1). To examine the pyroptotic activity of CASP3/7-cleaved TrGSDME, TrCASP3/7 and TrGSDME were overexpressed in HEK293T cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2F and G</xref>). The cells expressing TrCASP3, TrCASP7 or TrGSDME alone had no apparent morphological change or LDH release, whereas the cells co-expressing TrGSDME and TrCASP3 or TrGSDME and TrCASP7 underwent pyroptosis, accompanying with massive LDH release and TrGSDME cleavage (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2G-I</xref>). Consistently, the presence of the CASP3 inhibitor and pan-CASP inhibitor hampered TrGSDME-mediated pyroptosis (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2J and K</xref>). Mutation of the cleavage site (D255R and D258A) inhibited pyroptosis and significantly decreased LDH release (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2L and M</xref>). These results indicated that CASP3/7 cleavage was required to activate TrGSDME-mediated pyroptosis.</p>

<title>GSDME-CT domain mediates the recognition by CASP7</title>
<p>Since it is known that human GSDME is cleaved by CASP3 but not by CASP7, the observation that TrGSDME was cleaved by both human and fish CASP3/7 intrigued us to explore the underlying mechanism. We found that both HsCASP3 and 7 exhibited proteolytic activity towards the consensus CASP3/7 recognition motif, DMPD, in HsGSDME, but HsCASP7 failed to cleave HsGSDME (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A and B</xref>). Sequence alignment revealed that compared to TrGSDME, HsGSDME possesses two additional regions with the possibility to form a β-strand (261-266 aa) and an α-helix (281-296 aa), respectively (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>). We tested whether deletion of these two regions could confer HsCASP7 cleavage on HsGSDME. The results showed that similar to the wild type HsGSDME, the β-strand deletion mutant (Δ261-266) and the α-helix deletion mutant (Δ281-296) were cleaved by HsCASP3 but not by HsCASP7 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>). Since the NT and CT domains play different roles in GSDM structure maintenance, we constructed GSDME chimeras consisting of HsGSDME-NT plus TrGSDME-CT (named HsNT-TrCT), or TrGSDME-NT plus HsGSDME-CT (named TrNT-HsCT) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E</xref>). Compared with wild type HsGSDME and TrGSDME, chimeric HsNT-TrCT was cleaved by HsCASP3/7, whereas TrNT-HsCT was cleaved only by HsCASP3 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3F-I</xref>), suggesting that the CT domain determined the cleavability of GSDME by HsCASP7.</p>

<title>The p10 subunit determines the substrate specificity of CASP7</title>
<p>Since as shown above, unlike HsCASP7, TrCASP7 was able to cleave HsGSDME (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3H</xref>), we compared the sequences of TrCASP7 and HsCASP7.

<title>The S234 of p10 is the key to HsCASP7 discrimination on HsGSDME</title>
<p>Comparative analysis of the p10 sequences of TrCASP7 and HsCASP7 identified 13 non-conserved residues. To examine their potential involvement in GSDME cleavage, a series of site-directed mutagenesis was performed to swap the non-conserved residues between HsCASP7 p10 and TrCASP7 p10 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>, <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1B</xref> and <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">C</xref>). Of the 13 swaps created, S234N conferred on HsCASP7 the ability to cleave HsGSDME (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>), whereas its corresponding swap in TrCASP7 (N245S) markedly reduced the ability of TrCASP7 to cleave HsGSDME (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>). None of the 13 swaps affected the ability of HsCASP7 or TrCASP7 to cleave TrGSDME (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D, E</xref>). HsCASP7-S234N cleaved HsGSDME in a dose-dependent manner (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5F</xref>), and the cleavage was not enhanced by the additional mutation of S247N&amp;I248V (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5G</xref>). Previous studies showed that human CASP1/4 cleaved GSDMD through exosite interaction (Z. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Liu et al., 2020</xref>). To test whether there exists similar interaction between HsCASP7 and HsGSDME, three residues close to the corresponding CASP1/4 exosite in HsCASP7 were mutated (Q276W&amp;D278E&amp;H283S). Like the wild type, this mutant was unable to cleave HsGSDME (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5G</xref>), suggesting that, unlike human GSDMD, HsGSDME cleavage by CASPs probably did not involve exosite interaction. In contrast to HsGSDME, TrGSDME cleavage by HsCASP7 was not affected by the mutation of S234N, S234N plus S247N&amp;I248V, or Q276W&amp;D278E&amp;H283S (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5H</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>GSDME is an ancient member of the GSDM family existing ubiquitously in vertebrate from teleost to mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Broz, Pelegrin, &amp; Shao, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">De Schutter et al., 2021</xref>). In human, GSDME is specifically cleaved by CASP3 at the consensus motif DMPD, but it is not cleaved by CASP7, which recognizes the same DxxD motif. CASP3 cleavage releases the pyroptosis-inducing NT fragment from the association of the inhibitory CT fragment and switches cell death from apoptosis to pyroptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Rogers et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Wang et al., 2017</xref>). In this study, we found that different from human GSDME, pufferfish GSDME was specifically cleaved by both CASP3 and CASP7 at the site of DAVD to liberate the pyroptosis-inducing NT fragment. In teleost, there generally exist two GSDME orthologs, named GSDMEa and GSDMEb. In tongue sole <italic>Cynoglossus semilaevis</italic>, GSDMEb is preferably cleaved by CASP1 to trigger pyroptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Jiang, Gu, Zhao, &amp; Sun, 2019</xref>). In zebrafish <italic>Danio rerio</italic>, GSDMEb is activated by caspy2 (CASP5 homolog) through the NLR family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome signaling pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Li et al., 2020</xref>; Z. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Wang et al., 2020</xref>). These observations indicate that similar to mammalian GSDMD, teleost GSDMEb is activated by inflammatory CASPs. In contrast, teleost GSDMEa is cleaved mainly by apoptotic CASPs. In zebrafish, GSDMEa is cleaved by CASP3 to generate the pyroptotic NT fragment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Wang et al., 2017</xref>). In turbot <italic>Scophthalmus maximus</italic>, GSDMEa is bi-directionally regulated by CASP3/7, which activate GSDMEa, and CASP6, which inactivates GSDMEa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Xu, Jiang, Yu, Yuan, &amp; Sun, 2022</xref>). The complicated scenario of GSDME-mediated pyroptosis signaling in fish is likely due to the reason that, unlike mammals that have multiple GSDM members to induce pyroptosis under different conditions, fish have only GSDME to induce pyroptotic cell death. Regulation by different CASPs may represent a mechanism that enables fish GSDME to execute the orders of different pyroptotic signals.</p>
<p>It is intriguing that, although HsCASP3 and 7 were indistinguishable in proteolysis towards the consensus tetrapeptide, they differed remarkably in the cleavage of HsGSDME and TrGSDME. HsCASP3, but not HsCASP7, cleaved HsGSDME, whereas both HsCASP3 and 7 cleaved TrGSDME at the same site. NT/CT domain swapping between HsGSDME and TrGSDME showed that chimeric GSDMEs containing the TrGSDME-CT domain were cleaved by human as well as pufferfish CASP7 regardless of the source of the NT, whereas chimeric GSDMEs containing the HsGSDME-CT domain were resistant to HsCASP7. These results indicate that the CT domain, which is well accepted to exert an inhibitory effect on the pore-forming NT domain (Z. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Liu et al., 2019</xref>; J. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Shi et al., 2015</xref>), is the target of HsCASP7 discrimination, and hence determines the cleavability of GSDME by HsCASP7. Recently, Wang and Liu studied the molecular mechanism of human GSDMD recognition by CASP1/4, and showed that GSDMD-CT interacted with CASP1/4 exosites through binding to a hydrophobic pocket, which enhanced the recognition by CASP1/4 and contributed to tetrapeptide sequence-independent cleavage of GSDMD (Z. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Liu et al., 2020</xref>; K. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Wang et al., 2020</xref>). Different from GSDMD, we found that for TrGSDME, mutation of either the P4 (D255) or P1 (D258) residue of the consensus motif <sup>255</sup>DAVD<sup>258</sup> made it resistant to CASP3/7, implying a lack of DAVD-independent cleavage mechanism. Similarly, a previous study observed that human and mouse GSDME harboring cleavage site (P4 or P1) mutation resisted CASP3 cleavage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Wang et al., 2017</xref>). These results suggest that, compared to GSDMD, GSDME has a distinct enzyme-substrate engagement mode that, as demonstrated in the present study, involves GSDME-CT.</p>
<p>Unlike HsCASP7, which was unable to cleave HsGSDME, TrCASP7 effectively cleaved HsGSDME. The swapping of p20 between HsCASP7 and TrCASP7 revealed that the two catalytic motifs in p20, i.e., SHG and QACRG, were not involved in HsCASP7 discrimination on GSDME. SWR and GSWF are known to be responsible for CASP substrate binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Chai et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Riedl et al., 2001</xref>). However, in our study, we found that these two motifs are conserved in human and pufferfish CASP7, and they had no apparent effect on the substrate discrimination of HsCASP7. By contrast, the chimeric HsCASP7 containing the p10 subunit of TrCASP7 acquired the ability to cleave HsGSDME, indicating an important role of p10. By a series of residue swapping and mutation analyses, we discovered that the residue in the position of 245 (in TrCASP7) or 234 (in HsCASP7) of the p10 subunit was the key that determined CASP7 cleavage of HsGSDME. Sequence analysis revealed that N245 is highly conserved in the CASP7 of teleost, amphibians, reptiles and birds, but not in the CASP7 of mammals, especially primates. With the exception of primates, the conserved Asn is present in a large number of mammals, including mice. Mouse CASP7 was able to cleave HsGSDME, further supporting the importance of the Asn in CASP7 recognition and cleavage. However, mouse CASP7 failed to cleave mouse GSDME, which is in accordance with the previous report that CASP7 deletion has little effect on mouse GSDME-mediated pyroptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Sarhan et al., 2018</xref>). These results suggest mutually independent evolution of GSDME and CASP7 in mice, which likely has distanced GSDME and CASP7 from each other. Similarly, human CASP7 and GSDME may also have undergone independent evolution, which leads to the disengagement of GSDME from the substrate relationship with CASP7.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we identified a teleost GSDME that can be cleaved by fish and human CASP3/7 to trigger pyroptosis. The GSDME-CT domain and the CASP7 p10 subunit are critical in the determination of CASP7 cleavage of GSDME. Within the p10 subunit, a single residue plays a key role in CASP7 substrate recognition and cleavage. Our results reveal the molecular basis of the functional divergence of CASP7 and CASP3, and suggest separate evolutions of CASP7 and GSDME in mammals. These findings add new insights into CASP-regulated GSDME activation in lower and higher vertebrates.</p>

<title>CASP activity</title>
<p>To measure their proteolytic activity, recombinant CASPs were incubated separately with various colorimetric substrates as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Jiang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Xu et al., 2022</xref>), and then monitored for released ρNA at OD405. To compare their substrate preference, TrCASP3/7 and HsCASP3/7 were incubated with Ac-DAVD-ρNA or Ac-DMPD-ρNA (Science Peptide Biological Technology Co., Ltd, shanghai, China) at 37℃ for 1 h, and the released ρNA was measured at OD405. The CASP activity in cells transfected TrCASP3/7 was determined as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Xu et al., 2022</xref>).</p>

<title>GSDME cleavage by CASPs</title>
<p>GSDME cleavage assay was performed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Jiang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Xu et al., 2022</xref>). Briefly, recombinant GSDME was incubated with recombinant HsCASP1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8 and 9 (Enzo Life Sciences, Villeurbanne, France) at 37℃ for 1 h in the reaction buffer (50 mM Hepes (pH 7.5), 3 mM EDTA, 150 mM NaCl, 0.005% (v/v) Tween 20, and 10 mM DTT). TrGSDME, HsGSDME or their chimeras were treated with TrCASP3/7, HsCASP3/7, or their chimeras for 2 h as above in reaction buffer. After incubation, the samples were boiled in 5 х Loading Buffer (GenScript, Piscataway, NJ, USA) and subjected to SDS-PAGE or immunoblotting with indicated antibody.</p>

<title>Cell death examination</title>
<p>Cell death examination by microscopy was performed as reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Jiang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Xu et al., 2022</xref>). Briefly, HEK293T cells were plated into 35 mm glass-bottom culture dishes (Nest Biotechnology, Wuxi, China) at about 60% confluency and subjected to the indicated treatment. To examine cell death morphology, propidium iodide (PI) (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and DiO (Solarbio, Beijing, China) were added to the culture medium, and the cells were observed with a Carl Zeiss LSM 710 confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany). To video the cell death process, the cells were transfected with pmCherry-N1 vector expressing TrGSDME-NT, and cell death was recorded using the above microscope. Cell death measured by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assay was performed as reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Xu et al., 2022</xref>).</p>

<p>Summary</p>
<p>
In this study, Xu et al. provide insights into the substrate divergence of CASP3 and CASP7 for GSDME cleavage and activation during vertebrate evolution vertebrates. Using biochemical assays, domain swapping, site-directed mutagenesis, and bioinformatics tools, the authors demonstrate that the human GSDME C-terminal region and the S234 residue of human CASP7 are the key determinants that impede the cleavage of human GSDME by human CASP7.</p>
<p>Strengths</p>
<p>
The authors made an important contribution to the field by demonstrating how human CASP7 has functionally diverged to lose the ability to cleave GSDME and showing that reverse-mutations in CASP7 can restore GSDME cleavage. The use of multiple methods to support their conclusions strengthens the authors' findings. The unbiased mutagenesis screen performed to identify S234 in huCASP7 as the determinant of its GSDME cleavability is also a strength.</p>
<p>Weaknesses</p>
<p>
While the authors utilized an in-depth experimental setup to understand the CASP7-mediated GSDME cleavage across evolution, the physiological relevance of their findings are not assessed in detail. Additional methodology information should also be provided.</p>
<p>Specific recommendations for the authors</p>
<p>
1. The authors should expand their evaluation of the physiological relevance by assessing GSDME cleavage by the human CASP7 S234N mutant in response to triggers such as etoposide or VSV, which are known to induce CASP3 to cleave GSDME (PMID: 28045099). The authors could also test whether the human CASP7 S234N mutation affects substrate preference beyond human GSDME by testing cleavage of mouse GSDME and other CASP3 and CASP7 substrates in this mutant.</p>
<p>
2. It would also be interesting to examine the GSDME structure in different species to gain insight into the nature of mouse GSDME, which cannot be cleaved by either mouse or human CASP7.</p>
<p>
3. The evolutionary analysis does not explain why mammalian CASP7 evolved independently to acquire an amino acid change (N234 to S234) in the substrate-binding motif. Since it is difficult to experimentally identify why a functional divergence occurs, it would be beneficial for the authors to speculate on how CASP7 may have acquired functional divergence in mammals; potentially this occurred because of functional redundancies in cell death pathways, for example.</p>
<p>
4. For the recombinant proteins produced for these analyses, it would be helpful to know whether size-exclusion chromatography was used to purify these proteins and whether these purified proteins are soluble. Additionally, the SDS-PAGE in Figure S1B and C show multiple bands for recombinant mutants of TrCASP7 and HsCASP7. Performing protein ID to confirm that the detected bands belong to the respective proteins would be beneficial.</p>
<p>
5. For Figures 3C and 4A, it would be helpful to mention what parameters or PDB files were used to attribute these secondary structural features to the proteins. In particular, in Figure 3C, residues 261-266 are displayed as a β-strand; however, the well-known α-model represents this region as a loop. Providing the parameters used for these callouts could explain this difference.</p>
<p>
6. Were divergent sequences selected for the sequence alignment analyses (particularly in Figure 6A)? The selection of sequences can directly influence the outcome of the amino acid residues in each position, and using diverse sequences can reduce the impact of the number of sequences on the LOGO in each phylogenetic group.</p>
<p>
7. For clarity, it would help if the authors provided additional rationale for the selection of residues for mutagenesis, such as selecting Q276, D278, and H283 as exosite residues, when the CASP7 PDB structures (4jr2, 3ibf, and 1k86) suggest that these residues are enriched with loop elements rather than the β sheets expected to facilitate substrate recognition in exosites for caspases (PMID: 32109412). It is possible that the inability to form β-sheets around these positions might indicate the absence of an exosite in CASP7, which further supports the functional effect of the exosite mutations performed.</p>

<p>The authors wanted to address the differential processing of GSDME by caspase 3 and 7, finding that while in humans GSDME is only processed by CASP3, Takifugu GSDME, and other mammalian can be processed by CASP3 and 7. This is due to a change in a residue in the human CAPS7 active site that abrogates GSDME cleavage. This phenomenon is present in humans and other primates, but not in other mammals such as cats or rodents. This study sheds light on the evolutionary changes inside CASP7, using sequences from different species. Although the study is somehow interesting and elegantly provides strong evidence of this observation, it lacks the physiological relevance of this finding, i.e. on human side, mouse side, and fish what are the consequences of CASP3/7 vs CASP3 cleavage of GSDME.</p>
<p>Fish also present a duplication of GSDME gene and Takifugu present GSDMEa and GSDMEb. It is not clear in the whole study if when referring to TrGSDME is the a or b. This should be stated in the text and discussed in the differential function of both GSDME in fish physiology (i.e. PMIDs: 34252476, 32111733 or 36685536).</p>
