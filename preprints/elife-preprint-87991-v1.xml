<title>Abstract</title><p>Phenotypic heterogeneity promotes tumor evolution and confounds treatment. Minority subpopulations of trailblazer cells enhance the heterogeneity of invading populations by creating paths in extracellular matrix (ECM) that permit the invasion of phenotypically diverse siblings. The regulatory programs that induce a trailblazer state are poorly understood. Here, we define a new Tgfβ induced trailblazer population that is more aggressive than previously characterized Keratin 14 expressing trailblazer cells. Rather than triggering a binary switch to a single trailblazer state, Tgfβ induced multiple unique states that were distinguished by their expression of regulatory transcription factors, genes involved in ECM reorganization and capacity to initiate collective invasion. The integration of a parallel Egfr signaling program was necessary to induce pro-motility genes and could be targeted with clinically approved drugs to prevent trailblazer invasion. Surprisingly, Egfr pathway activity also had the collateral consequence of antagonizing the expression of a cohort of Tgfβ induced genes, including a subset involved in ECM remodeling. Together, our results reveal a new compromise mode of signal integration that promotes a trailblazer state and can be therapeutically targeted to prevent collective invasion.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Tumor cell phenotypic heterogeneity is the product of genetic and epigenetic variability, localized differences in the microenvironment and stochastic fluctuations in intracellular signaling pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>). This diversity in cell phenotypes drives tumor evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>). Cells with traits that provide a competitive advantage over siblings become predominant, improving the fitness of the population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>). High variance in cell phenotypes also increases the odds that a subpopulation has the potential to survive when the local environment changes, such as during treatment or when disseminating cells seed other organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>). Interestingly, analysis of intrinsic and genetically engineered heterogeneity has revealed that phenotypic diversity also promotes functional interactions between tumor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>). Rare enabler tumor subpopulations can promote the growth, immune evasion, invasion and metastasis of abundant siblings harboring different phenotypic traits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>). However, the regulatory programs that promote functional relationships between phenotypically distinct subpopulations remain poorly understood. This lack of mechanistic insight limits our ability to define the presence of functional tumor cell interactions, evaluate their impact on patient outcome, and develop new treatment options designed to target rare enabler cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>).</p>
<p>To better understand how subpopulation relationships are induced during tumor progression, we sought to understand how tumor cells are conferred with the ability to promote the collective invasion of intrinsically less invasive siblings. Collective invasion is the predominant mode of invasion in carcinomas and promotes the dispersion of tumor clusters that seed metastases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>). Subpopulations of trailblazer cells detected in breast, lung and thyroid tumor populations have an enhanced ability to reorganize the extracellular matrix (ECM) into micro-tracks that facilitate the initiation of collective invasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>). Importantly, sibling opportunist populations invade through the micro-tracks created by minority trailblazer populations in three-dimensional culture models and xenograft tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>). Moreover, opportunist cells can have greater proliferative capacity than trailblazers in vitro and in xenografts, indicating that trailblazer-opportunist relationships have the potential to increase the proliferative fitness of invading cell populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>). Thus, trailblazer cells promote phenotypic diversity in invading cell cohorts, which may increase the risk of metastasis and elevate the risk of resistance to treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>).</p>
<p>Trailblazer cells are distinguished from the bulk tumor population by the increased expression of trailblazer genes, including regulators of the actin cytoskeleton, integrins, receptor tyrosine kinases, keratins, and cancer testes antigens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>). Trailblazer genes contribute to the formation of actin-rich cellular protrusions that provide traction and exert tensile forces necessary for ECM remodeling and other undefined functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>). Interestingly, trailblazer genes are not required for other forms of cell movement, including migration along two-dimensional surfaces, movement within spheroids and opportunistic collective invasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>). While genes that specifically contribute to unique invasive characteristics of trailblazer cells have begun to be defined, the regulatory programs underpinning the conversion to a trailblazer state remain largely unknown. Trailblazer cells in breast and lung cancer cell line models are epigenetically distinct from opportunist siblings, although the processes that initiate the conversion to the trailblazer state are not known (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>). Breast cancer trailblazer cells have basal characteristics, with Keratin 14 (Krt14) expression proposed as a universal feature for identifying trailblazer cells in mammary tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>). Yet, the program controlling the induction of a basal trailblazer state is undefined. Breast cancer trailblazer cells also have features of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) re-programming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>). However not all EMT programs yield trailblazer activity and whether EMT programs regulate the expression of trailblazer genes is not known (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>). Thus, if and how the EMT process imbues a trailblazer state is unclear. Our poor understanding of how trailblazer populations are induced limits options for potential interventions targeting trailblazer cells and advances in employing subpopulation identification to refine patient outcome predictions.</p>
<p>To define factors regulating trailblazer program activity, we determined how cells were induced to collectively invade in the C3(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>)/SV40 T-antigen (C3-TAg) genetically engineered mouse model (GEMM) of breast cancer. Based on histological analysis, breast cancer is defined as Estrogen Receptor-positive (ER-positive), Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor-positive (HER2-pos) or triple-negative (TNBC), which have low to undetectable levels of ER, HER2 and the Progesterone Receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>). Breast cancer is further stratified into luminal A, luminal B, HER2-enriched and basal-like based on mRNA expression. Luminal A are Estrogen Receptor-positive (ER-pos) while luminal B are more proliferative and are ER-pos or HER2-pos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>). The HER2-enriched subtype is generally HER2-pos and 70-80% of the basal-like breast cancers are classified as TNBC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>). The C3-TAg model is most similar to human basal-like TNBC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>).</p>
<p>Through the analysis of tumor organoid invasion dynamics, a data driven functional dissection of cellular re-programming and quantitative imaging of fixed tumor sections, we discovered a Tgfβ regulated program that was necessary to induce and sustain a trailblazer state in C3-TAg tumors and validated this discovery in breast cancer patient tumor samples. Surprisingly, the Tgfβ regulated trailblazer cells were not specified by Krt14 expression and were more aggressive than a previously defined Krt14 expressing trailblazer population detected in a luminal B GEMM, indicating that there are multiple different programs for conferring trailblazer ability in breast tumors. In addition, trailblazer cells induced by Tgfβ signaling were themselves heterogeneous, having different degrees of re-programming and capacities to initiate invasion. Tgfβ signaling collaborated with a parallel Egfr-Mek1/2-Erk1/2-Fra1 pathway to coordinate the expression of a subset of pro-motility genes, including Axl. Interestingly, the integration was also equivalently antagonistic in scope, with Egfr activity restricting the Tgfβ induced expression of a cohort of pro-invasive genes. Notably, clinically approved inhibitors of Egfr, Mek1/2 and Axl suppressed collective invasion. This indicated that the collateral inhibition of subset of pro-invasive genes by the Egfr pathway was a feature of the trailblazer state. Thus, our results reveal how a new type of trailblazer cell is induced by a therapeutically addressable compromise between Tgfβ and Egfr signaling programs.</p>

<title>The trailblazer cells in C3-TAg basal-like tumors are distinct from trailblazer cells in PyMT luminal B tumors</title>
<p>To define factors that initiate the conversion to a trailblazer state, we investigated the invasive properties of tumor cells isolated from the C3-TAg GEMM of basal-like TNBC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>) and <bold>(Supplementary file 1)</bold>. We first determined if there was heterogeneity with respect to the ability to invade in the tumor populations, which would indicate the potential for trailblazer-opportunist relationships.

<p>To understand how the trailblazer state was induced in C3-TAg tumor cells, we next evaluated the relationship between Krt14 expression and the ability of cells to lead collective invasion. Krt14 identifies cells that have converted from a luminal non-invasive state to a basal trailblazer state in the MMTV-PyMT (PyMT) GEMM model of luminal B breast cancer, which is commonly used to study breast cancer invasion and metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>). Based on these results, it has been suggested that a basal gene expression program exemplified by Krt14 expression is a universal feature of breast cancer trailblazer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>). Consistent with prior results, Krt14 was expressed in PyMT trailblazer cells and Krt14 expression correlated with PyMT tumor organoid invasion <bold>(<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C-D</xref>)</bold>. Krt14 was expressed in a greater proportion of cells in C3-TAg tumors compared to PyMT tumors <bold>(<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>)</bold>. The high Krt14 expression was consistent with the early acquisition of basal traits detected in C3-TAg and TNBC tumors during the initial stages of growth within mammary ducts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>). However, Krt14 expression did not correlate with C3-TAg tumor collective invasion or a trailblazer state in our analysis of primary tumors, tumor organoids and trailblazer and opportunist cell lines <bold>(<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C, E-F</xref>, <xref rid="fig1s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F</xref>)</bold>. In fact, extensive collective invasion was detected in C3-TAg tumor organoids with few, if any, Krt14 expressing cells <bold>(<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>)</bold>. Krt14<sup>neg</sup> C3-TAg tumor cells also led collective invasion as frequently as Krt14<sup>pos</sup> cells <bold>(<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>)</bold>. C3-TAg organoids were relatively more invasive than PyMT organoids, demonstrating that the C3-TAg tumor invasion was more aggressive than the Krt14 <italic>s</italic>pecified invasion of PyMT tumors <bold>(<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G</xref>, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1H</xref>, <xref rid="fig1s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1—figure supplement 1G</xref>, Figure 1—Videos 7-8)</bold>. Together, these results suggested that essential features of the C3-TAg trailblazer program were different than those of the PyMT trailblazer program, and that and more than a single Krt14 specified trailblazer program functioned in breast cancer patient tumors <bold>(<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1H</xref>)</bold>.</p>

<title>Trailblazer cells in C3-TAg GEMM tumors are distinguished by a subset of EMT traits</title>
<p>Given the lack of concordance with the established Krt14 specified trailblazer program, we next took an unbiased approach to identify the key trailblazer regulatory program features in C3-TAg tumors. To do this, we used next generation RNA sequencing to define differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in tumor organoids from 4 C3-TAg tumors compared with non-invasive spheroids formed by 3 clonal C3-TAg tumor derived cell lines <bold>(<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref rid="fig2s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>)</bold>. Among epithelial keratins, Krt14 expression was reduced in C3-TAg tumor organoids compared to the non-invasive clonal C3-TAg cells, consistent with a lack of Krt14 involvement in C3-TAg collective invasion (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>, Supplementary file 2)</bold>. Expression of the transcription factor p63 was also reduced in C3-TAg tumor organoids and trailblazer clones, further indicating that canonical traits of normal basal mammary epithelial cells and Krt14 specified trailblazer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>) were not essential features of C3-TAg trailblazer cells (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref rid="fig2s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>, Supplementary file 2)</bold>. In addition, Krt14 expression was only detected in 1 out of 4 trailblazer populations in human breast cancer cell lines, which were all classified as TNBC <bold>(<xref rid="fig2s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>)</bold>. The expression of p63 was also low in all 4 trailblazer populations <bold>(<xref rid="fig2s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>)</bold>, consistent with our previous results showing that p63 expression is sufficient to suppress the induction of a trailblazer state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>).</p>

<p>Genes highly expressed in C3-TAg tumor organoids were associated with biological processes that contribute to invasion (ECM Receptor Interaction, Focal Adhesions and Regulation of the Actin Cytoskeleton) and EMT <bold>(<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C-D</xref>, <xref rid="fig2s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D-E</xref>, Supplementary file 2)</bold>. The C3-TAg tumor organoids retained canonical epithelial gene expression as well, indicating that the majority of cells were in a hybrid EMT state (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>, Supplementary file 2)</bold>. The EMT inducing transcription factors (EMT-TFs) Zeb1, Zeb2 and Fra1 were more highly expressed in C3-TAg organoids, consistent with their high expression in trailblazer cells in human breast cancer cell lines <bold>(<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>, <xref rid="fig2s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>)</bold>. However, the EMT-TFs Snail, Slug and Twist1 were expressed at similar or higher levels in the noninvasive clones, which was consistent with a lack of concordance between the induction of a trailblazer state and Snail, Slug and Twist1 expression in human breast cancer cell lines <bold>(<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>, <xref rid="fig2s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>)</bold>. These results indicated that the specific features of a trailblazer EMT program determined the invasive phenotype of C3-TAg tumor cells, rather than simply the presence or absence of EMT traits, consistent with results obtained analyzing human breast cancer cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>). Our combined results demonstrated that an EMT program exemplified by Vimentin expression conferred a trailblazer state in C3-TAg tumor subpopulations <bold>(<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2G</xref>)</bold>.</p>
<p>To understand the relationship between the EMT program features of the C3-TAg organoids and collective invasion, we evaluated the expression of the microfilament protein Vimentin, a common EMT marker that was more highly expressed in C3-TAg organoids <bold>(<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>)</bold>. Vimentin expression was more frequently and extensively detected in invasive C3-TAg tumor cells compared to non-invasive C3-TAg mammary intraepithelial neoplasia (MIN) cells, consistent with Vimentin expression specifying a trailblazer EMT state in C3-TAg tumors. Notably, Vimentin expression was rarely detected in invasive PyMT tumor cells, further indicating that the regulatory programs inducing a trailblazer state in C3-TAg and PyMT tumors were distinct <bold>(<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2G</xref>, <xref rid="fig2s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 1F</xref>)</bold>. The heterogeneity of Vimentin expression in C3-TAg tumors was consistent with the heterogeneity in the extent of C3-TAg organoid invasion <bold>(<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>)</bold>. Vimentin<sup>pos</sup> and Vimentin<sup>neg</sup> cells also collectively invaded together in C3-TAg primary tumors and organoids, suggesting that there was heterogeneity in collectively invading cell populations with respect to EMT state <bold>(<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2G</xref>, <xref rid="fig2s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 1F</xref>)</bold>.</p>

<p>We next investigated the characteristics of collectively invading cells in breast cancer patient tumors.

<p>Metastasis is rarely detected in female mice bearing C3-TAg mammary tumors, likely because the rapid rate growth in primary tumors requires mice to be euthanized before metastases have time to develop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>). Therefore, to understand the relationship between the induction of Vimentin high cells and metastasis, we evaluated Vimentin expression in metastatic HCI-001 patient derived xenograft (PDX) TNBC tumors and their corresponding lung metastases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>). Intra- and inter-tumor heterogeneity in Vimentin expression was detected in the HCI-001 primary tumors <bold>(<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>)</bold>. The heterogeneity and range in Vimentin expression was similar to what was observed in C3-TAg tumors and TNBC patient tumors <bold>(<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2G</xref>, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>)</bold>. An evaluation of the lungs revealed disseminated HCI-001 tumor cell clusters in the pulmonary vasculature <bold>(<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref>, top row)</bold>, partially localized within the vasculature and lung tissue <bold>(<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref>, middle row)</bold> and fully localized within lung tissue <bold>(<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref>, bottom row)</bold>.

<title>Tgfβ induces a trailblazer state in C3-TAg tumors</title>
<p>We next sought to define regulatory factors that activated the Vimentin specified trailblazer program. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) indicated that Tgfβ signaling was more active in C3-TAg tumor organoids than non-invasive spheroids <bold>(<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>, Supplementary file 2)</bold>. Thus, we evaluated the contribution of Tgfβ towards regulation of a trailblazer state. A pharmacological inhibitor of Tgfβ receptor 1 (Tgfbr1), A83-01, suppressed the invasion of freshly derived C3-TAg tumor organoids <bold>(<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>)</bold>. 1863 cells derived in the presence of A83-01 were also less invasive than 1863T cells established from the same tumor in the absence of A83-01 <bold>(<xref rid="fig4s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>, Supplementary file 1)</bold>.

<p>To determine if Tgfβ could initiate the conversion from an opportunist to a trailblazer state, we first established organoid lines from 3 different C3-TAg tumors in the presence of A83-01 for at least 4 weeks <bold>(<xref rid="fig4s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A</xref>, Supplementary file 1)</bold>. These conditions yielded 1339-org, 1863-org and 1788-org tumor organoid lines that had a diminished Tgfβ activity and a reduced ability to invade relative to tumor organoids tested immediately after isolation from C3-TAg tumors <bold>(<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>, <xref rid="fig4s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A-C</xref>, Supplementary file 1)</bold>. Removal of A83-01 or SB431542, a second inhibitor of Tgfbr1, promoted tumor organoid line invasion <bold>(<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>, <xref rid="fig4s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 4—figure supplement 2B-C</xref>)</bold>. The invasion of the tumor organoid lines was further enhanced by exogenous TGFβ1 within 48 h <bold>(<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>, <xref rid="fig4s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 4—figure supplement 2B-C</xref>, Figure 4—Videos 1-3)</bold>. Persistent exposure of 1339-org cells to Tgfβ signaling for up to 22 days progressively increased the rate of collective invasion <bold>(<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>, Figure 4—Videos 1-4)</bold>. TGFβ signaling for at least 7 days also increased the frequency that trailblazer cells detached from collectively invading cohorts and invaded as single cells, suggesting that at least some single cell invasion reflected a loss of cohesion rather than the activation of a separate invasion program <bold>(<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>, Figure 4—Video 4)</bold>.</p>
<p>To understand how the induction of a trailblazer state by Tgfβ influenced the properties of cells during primary tumor growth, we injected control 1339-org cells cultured in A83-01 (Control) or 1339-org cells stimulated with Tgfβ for 21 days (+Tgfβ) into the mammary fat pads of immune-compromised mice. Both Control and +Tgfβ 1339-org cells initiated the growth of primary tumors <bold>(<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>)</bold>. Interestingly, newly isolated organoids from the Control and +Tgfβ tumors were equivalently invasive <bold>(<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4G</xref>)</bold>. This similarity was a consequence of the induction of a trailblazer state in the Control 1339-org primary tumors, which was indicated by the new organoids derived from Control 1339-org tumors being more invasive than Control 1339-org line cells prior to tumor growth <bold>(<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4G</xref>)</bold>. This induction of a trailblazer state was potentially due to stimulation of primary tumor cells by Tgfβ in the tumor microenvironment produced my nontumor cells, such as macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>). Consistent with the equivalent invasion of the new primary tumor organoids, the tumors that developed from Control and +Tgfβ organoids contained a similar fraction of Vimentin expressing cells <bold>(<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>)</bold>. The equivalent invasive behavior of the tumors also corresponded with a similar number of disseminating tumor cells detected in the blood <bold>(<xref rid="fig4s3" ref-type="fig">Figure 4—figure supplement 3A</xref>)</bold>. Metastatic tumor cells were not detected in the lung, indicating that the extent of dissemination was not yet sufficient to initiate colonization, consistent with metastasis being a highly inefficient process <bold>(<xref rid="fig4s3" ref-type="fig">Figure 4—figure supplement 3B</xref>)</bold>. Thus, Tgfβ signaling promoted the conversion of C3-TAg cells to a trailblazer state.</p>

<title>Tgfβ induces multiple trailblazer states through distinct phases of re-programming</title>
<p>To understand how Tgfβ induced a trailblazer state, we used RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) to analyze gene expression changes 1339-org cells after 2, 7 and 22 days after Tgfβ pathway activation. Hierarchical clustering revealed 4 different groups of genes regulated by TGFβ <bold>(<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>, Supplementary file 3)</bold>. If cells were undergoing binary conversion between states, the population averaged mRNA expression obtained by RNA-seq would have shown 2 groups of genes (suppressed and induced) undergoing a gradual change in expression as percentage of cells in the 2 different states shifted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>). The 4 different gene groups, each with a unique timing in their onset of change and maximal expression difference, therefore indicated that the Tgfβ stimulated C3-TAg tumor cells progressed through different stages of re-programming. Consistent with inducing multiple different states, TGFβ promoted a shift in the distribution of EpCAM expression rather than a switch between two unique EpCAM-high and EpCAM-low states, <bold>(<xref rid="fig5s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>)</bold>. TGFβ also induced a shift in the distribution of Vimentin expression intensity in organoids at day 7 and day 22, as opposed to a switch between two distinct Vimentin<sup>neg</sup> and Vimentin<sup>pos</sup> states <bold>(<xref rid="fig5s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>)</bold>.</p>

<p>The gene groups identified by RNA-seq were associated with distinct combinations of biological processes <bold>(<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>, Supplementary file 3)</bold>. Of note, genes in Groups 3 and 4 were increased in expression with different kinetics in response to Tgfβ and involved with ECM regulation <bold>(<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>, Supplementary file 3)</bold>. This indicated that there were different mechanisms for regulating genes associated with the same biological functions in response to TGFβ. Group 3 and 4 genes were also connected with unique functions, which indicated that the nature of reprogramming changed over time and was controlled by distinct mechanisms. Interestingly, genes commonly associated with EMT were included in Group 3 (Vcam1, Itgb3, Fn1) and Group 4 (Vimentin, N-cadherin, Periostin) <bold>(Supplementary file 3)</bold>. EMT-TFs were also split between Group 3 (Zeb1), Group 4 (Zeb2, Twist), or not included in any group (Snail) <bold>(<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>)</bold>. E-cadherin (Group 1) and the mammary epithelial lineage markers p63, Krt8 and Krt14 (Group 2) were also decreased in expression on different time scales <bold>(<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>)</bold>. Consistent with these results, high Vimentin and Zeb1 expression and reduced E-cadherin expression was observed in D6 and 1863T trailblazer cells, indicating that these cell lines reflected features of trailblazer cells after persistent activation of Tgfβ signaling <bold>(<xref rid="fig5s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C-E</xref>)</bold>. Previously defined trailblazer genes were in Group 3 (Wisp1) and Group 4 (Dab2, Fstl1, Itga11, Pdgfra, Lpar1) <bold>(<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>)</bold>. Notably, Group 3 and Group 4 genes were enriched in the genes that were highly expressed in C3-TAg organoids, which indicated that Tgfβ re-activated a program that was present in C3-TAg tumors <bold>(<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5E</xref>, Supplementary file 3)</bold>.</p>
<p>The distinct expression profile of EMT-TFs, EMT effectors and ECM regulatory genes indicated that persistent Tgfβ pathway activation induced re-programming yielded multiple different trailblazer states in response to regulatory mechanisms that evolve over time. To test this possibility we immunostained 1339-org and C3-TAg tumor organoids with Vimentin and E-Cadherin antibodies, to specify different states within the spectrum of EMT re-programming. Vimentin<sup>neg</sup>/E-cadherin<sup>pos</sup>, Vimentin<sup>pos</sup>/E-cadherin<sup>pos</sup> and Vimentin<sup>pos</sup>/E-cadherin<sup>neg</sup> cells were all capable of leading collective invasion (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5F-G</xref>)</bold>. Notably, the presence of more Vimentin<sup>pos</sup>/E-cadherin<sup>pos</sup> and Vimentin<sup>pos</sup>/E-cadherin<sup>neg</sup> trailblazer cells with increasing time after Tgfβ pathway activation correlated with an increased extent of 1339-org collective invasion (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5F</xref>)</bold>. Our combined results suggested that there were multiple trailblazer states induced by Tgfβ and that they had different capacities to initiate collective invasion <bold>(<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5H</xref>)</bold>.</p>

A miR200a-3p mimic, which suppressed Zeb1 and 2 expression, inhibited 1863 and 1863T invasion, further indicating Zeb1 and 2 contribute to the induction of a trailblazer state <bold>(<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>, <xref rid="fig6s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C</xref>)</bold>. The requirement of Zeb1, but not Zeb2, for the invasion of 1863 cells upon initial TGFβ stimulation was consistent with our results showing that Zeb1 expression rapidly increased within 7 days while increased Zeb2 expression occurred after day 7 of extrinsic TGFβ exposure <bold>(<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>)</bold>. Thus, our results suggested that the requirement of Zeb1 and Zeb2 may be dependent on the specific trailblazer state induced by Tgfβ signaling.</p>
<p>Additional investigation of Fra1 revealed that Fra1 depletion by 4 individual siRNAs and 2 different siRNA pools reduced 1863T and TGFβ stimulated 1863 invasion to a similar degree <bold>(<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D</xref>, <xref rid="fig6s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 6—figure supplement 2A-D</xref>)</bold>. Fra1 depletion also reduced the invasion of D6 trailblazer cells and Tgfβ stimulated 1339 cells, which were derived from a different C3-TAg tumor than the 1863 and 1863T cells <bold>(<xref rid="fig6s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 6—figure supplement 2E-G</xref>)</bold>. Fra1 interacts with Jun to regulate gene expression as an AP-1 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>). Indeed, Jun was required for 1863T and Tgfβ stimulated 1863 cell invasion, suggesting Fra1 containing AP-1 complexes regulate the expression of genes necessary for the induction of a trailblazer state <bold>(<xref rid="fig6s3" ref-type="fig">Figure 6—figure supplement 3A-C</xref>)</bold>.</p>
<p>Exogenous Fra1 expression promotes Zeb1 and Zeb2 expression in a mouse mammary epithelial cell line, suggesting a potential connection between the functions of Fra1, Zeb1 and Zeb2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>). However, Fra1 depletion in 1863T cells did not alter Zeb1 or Zeb2 expression, indicating that Zeb1 and Zeb2 are not regulated by endogenous Fra1 in trailblazer cells <bold>(<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6E</xref>)</bold>. In addition, Zeb1, Zeb2 and Vimentin expression were regulated by autocrine TGFβ signaling or exogenous TGFβ treatment whereas Fra1 expression was not influenced by autocrine or extrinsic TGFβ pathway stimulation (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6F-G</xref>, Supplementary file 3)</bold>. These results indicated that the regulation of Fra1 expression was uncoupled from Tgfβ, Zeb1 and Zeb2. Nevertheless, Fra1 was expressed at a higher level in C3-TAg tumor organoids compared to non-invasive spheroids, consistent with increased Fra1 expression contributing to the induction of a trailblazer state <bold>(<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>)</bold>. In addition, FRA1 expression was higher in basal like breast cancer compared to other breast cancer subtypes <bold>(<xref rid="fig6s4" ref-type="fig">Figure 6—figure supplement 4A</xref>)</bold>. FRA1 expression also correlated with VIM (Vimentin) expression in breast cancer patients, suggesting that Fra1 potentially contributes to induction of a Vimentin specified trailblazer state during tumor progression in basal-like breast cancer patients <bold>(<xref rid="fig6s4" ref-type="fig">Figure 6—figure supplement 4B</xref>)</bold>. Thus, our data indicated that the induction of Fra1 and a trailblazer state in C3-TAg tumors required the activity of at least one additional signaling pathway acting in parallel with Tgfβ signaling <bold>(<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6H</xref>)</bold>. We therefore selected Fra1 for further analysis to more fully understand the global regulatory framework that empowered a trailblazer state.</p>

<title>Egfr pathway activity promotes Fra1 expression and a trailblazer state</title>
<p>We next determined how Fra1 expression was regulated in C3-TAg tumor cells. Fra1 mRNA was more highly expressed in C3-TAg tumor organoids compared to opportunist spheroids in our RNA-seq analysis, indicating that the signaling pathway responsible for the control of Fra1 was more active in the C3-TAg organoids <bold>(<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>)</bold>. GSEA identified multiple active KRAS regulated expression signatures that were more active in the C3-TAg tumor organoids <bold>(<xref rid="fig7s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 7— figure supplement 1A-B</xref>, Supplementary file 2)</bold>. The Kras gene can be amplified, but is not frequently mutated in C3-TAg tumors, indicating that pathway activation occurred upstream of Kras (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>). Analysis of the genes in the active KRAS signature showed that the Egfr ligand Hbegf was more highly expressed in C3-TAg organoids than opportunist clones <bold>(<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A</xref>, Supplementary file 2)</bold>. Like FRA1, HBEGF was more highly expressed in Basal type breast tumors <bold>(<xref rid="fig7s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 7—figure supplement 1C</xref>)</bold>. HBEGF expression correlated with FRA1 expression in breast cancer patient tumors as well, consistent with the possibility that Hbegf promotes Fra1 expression during tumor development <bold>(<xref rid="fig7s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 7—figure supplement 1D</xref>)</bold>. Further inspection found that the Egfr ligands Areg and Epgn were also expressed at a higher level in C3-TAg organoids <bold>(<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A</xref>, Supplementary file 2)</bold>. These combined results prompted us to investigate how the Egfr-Ras-Mek1/2-Erk1/2 signaling pathway contributed to Fra1 expression and the induction of a trailblazer state.</p>

By comparison, Jun expression was unchanged by treatment with either inhibitor <bold>(<xref rid="fig7s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 7—figure supplement 2B</xref>)</bold>. In addition, erlotinib and trametinib did not inhibit the activating phosphorylation of Smad2 or Zeb1 expression, indicating that the Egfr1-Mek1/2-Erk1/2-Fra1 did not influence cell state through autocrine Tgfβ signaling <bold>(<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7C</xref>, <xref rid="fig7s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 7—figure supplement 2C</xref>)</bold>. A83-01 suppressed Smad2 phosphorylation, but did not influence Fra1 expression and phosphorylation, further indicating that Tgfb signaling did not regulate Fra1 <bold>(<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7C</xref>)</bold>.</p>
<p>Erlotinib treatment reduced the TGFβ stimulated invasion of 1339-org cells <bold>(<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7D</xref>)</bold>. Trametinib treatment also blocked the initial stimulation of 1339-org invasion by Tgfβ, the invasion of 1339-org trailblazer cells following persistent Tgfβ treatment and the invasion D6 trailblazer cells (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7E</xref>, <xref rid="fig7s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 7—figure supplement 2D-E</xref>)</bold>. Moreover, extrinsic EGF induced the invasion of 1339-org, 1863-org and 1788-org cells and this enhancement was blocked by A83-01, further indicating that the integration of Tgfbr1 and Egfr pathways promoted a trailblazer state <bold>(<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7F</xref>, <xref rid="fig7s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 7—figure supplement 2F-G</xref>)</bold>. Trametinib inhibited the invasion of C3-Tag primary tumor organoids and phosphorylated Erk1/2 was detected in collectively invading cells in C3-TAg primary tumors <bold>(<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7G-H</xref>)</bold>. Erk1/2 activity is pulsatile in response to EGF stimulation, and these pulses promote Fra1 expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>). Thus, persistent Erk1/2 phosphorylation was not necessarily expected in all collectively invading cells or to promote Fra1 expression. Consistent with these results, A83-01, erlotinib and trametinib suppressed the invasion of human MCF10A-Trailblazer cells and MCFDCIS cells, which harbor features of basal-like breast cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>).

<title>A compromise between Tgfbr1 and Egfr regulated signaling programs confers the trailblazer state</title>
<p>To understand the contribution of the Tgfbr1 and Egfr regulated signaling pathways towards the induction of the trailblazer state, we performed RNA-seq on organoids treated with diluent, TGFβ, TGFβ+erlotinib, EGF and EGF+A83-01 <bold>(<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8A</xref>, <xref rid="fig8s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 8—figure supplement 1A</xref>)</bold>. Polar plots were used to cluster genes based on the nature and the degree of integration between the Tgfbr1 and Egfr signaling pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>). This analysis revealed multiple modes of interaction between the two pathways in response to either extrinsic TGFβ or EGF and that the type of interaction (positive or negative) was associated with different biological processes <bold>(<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8B-C</xref>, <xref rid="fig8s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 8—figure supplement 1B-F</xref>, Supplementary files 4 and 5)</bold>. Thus, the relationship was far more complex than the simple positive signal integration previously suggested by phenotypic analysis and the expression of specific canonical EMT program genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>). In addition, the gene expression changes induced by extrinsic TGFβ and EGF were associated with unique combinations of biological processes, indicating that extrinsic TGFβ and extrinsic EGF induced distinct types of trailblazer cells <bold>(<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8C</xref>, <xref rid="fig8s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 8—figure supplement 1F</xref>)</bold>. Nevertheless, there were conserved features of pathway integration that influenced the regulation of processes associated with invasion regardless of the external stimulus. Genes involved in controlling the organization and composition of the ECM, including previously defined trailblazer genes, were predominantly induced by Tgfbr1 and not positively impacted by Egfr signaling <bold>(<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8C</xref>, <xref rid="fig8s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 8—figure supplement 1F</xref>, Supplementary files 4 and 5).</bold> Notably, autocrine and extrinsic Egfr activation suppressed a number of Tgfbr1 regulated ECM reorganization genes and Hallmark EMT genes, including Postn, Bmp2, Itgb3, Orai2, Mmp11 and Erg <bold>(<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8D</xref>, <xref rid="fig8s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 8—figure supplement 1G</xref>, Supplementary files 4 and 5)</bold>, which can contribute to invasion and metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>). By comparison, autocrine or extrinsic EGF activity alone, or in combination with Tgfbr1 signaling, induced the expression of genes that promote cell motility, such as Axl, Sema7a, Ncam1 and Itga2 <bold>(<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8C</xref> and <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">E</xref>, <xref rid="fig8s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 8—figure supplement 1F</xref> and <xref rid="fig8s1" ref-type="fig">H</xref>, Supplementary files 4 and 5)</bold> and (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>). Thus, the induction of a set of pro-motility genes corresponded with a compromise between the Tgfbr1 and Egfr signaling programs. To determine how the Egfr dependent motility genes influenced the induction of the trailblazer state, we tested the function of the receptor tyrosine kinase Axl since it can be directly regulated by Fra1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>). The Axl inhibitor BGB324 suppressed C3-TAg organoid invasion, demonstrating that a gene positively regulated by combined Tgfbr1 and Egfr activity was necessary for trailblazer invasion <bold>(<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8F-G</xref>)</bold>. Together, these results suggested that the induction of the trailblazer state involved a compromise between the Tgfbr1 and Egfr regulated gene expression programs that limited the expression of genes involved in ECM reorganization and metastatic potential to promote cell motility that was essential for trailblazer cell invasion <bold>(<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8H</xref>)</bold>.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our findings indicate that defining how cells metastasize requires an understanding of how trailblazer cells are induced in different breast tumors <bold>(<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9</xref>)</bold>. The Tgfβ regulated trailblazer program that we have defined in the basal-like C3-TAg mammary tumor cells induced a more aggressive form of collective invasion than was detected in luminal B PyMT tumors and functioned independently of increased Krt14 and p63 expression. This indicated that the Tgfβ program was mechanistically and phenotypically distinct from a previously described Krt14-high trailblazer program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>). In addition, PyMT tumor cells rarely expressed detectable Vimentin, which suggested that the Tgfβ regulated trailblazer program that we identified was not active in PyMT tumors. Thus, our results indicate that there are at least 2 different trailblazer programs and that their activity and requirement for invasion varies between different types of mammary tumors associated with previously defined breast cancer intrinsic subtypes <bold>(<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9</xref>)</bold>. Genes induced as part of the C3-TAg trailblazer program are more frequently detected at a high level in basal-like breast cancer patients. Vimentin expression also correlated with collective invasion in TNBC patients, which are most often classified as basal-like. Vimentin expression was detected in basal-like TNBC PDX metastases as well. In addition, genes induced as part of the Tgfβ trailblazer program have previously been shown to correlate with reduced odds of survival in TNBC, but not patients classified as ER-positive or HER2-positive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>). These combined results indicate that the Tgfβ trailblazer program is active in basal-like TNBC and influences patient outcome. Tumor subtype specific mechanisms for inducing a trailblazer state are potentially a general property of cancer progression, as molecular subtypes are a feature of many carcinomas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref>). Further investigation is required to determine the extent to which the Tgfβ and Krt14 trailblazer programs align with existing tumor subtypes or define new categories of inter-tumor heterogeneity. Thus, our results provide new insight into approaches used to stratify patients into outcome groups.</p>

</fig>
<p>The heterogeneity in C3-TAg tumor organoid invasion indicated that the trailblazer population itself can be heterogeneous within tumors with the same primary driving genetic factors and molecular subtype <bold>(<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9</xref>)</bold>. Previous analysis of other tumor cell models had suggested that trailblazer cells were in a single uniform state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>). Notably, our analysis of 1339-org cells revealed that invasive variability can be a consequence of differences in cellular responses to a single stimulus, in this case TGFβ signaling. Therefore trailblazer cell phenotypic heterogeneity within a population did not necessarily reflect differences between EMT programs that were initiated by different activating signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref>). Gene expression changes in response to TGFβ are heterogeneous and temporally regulated in other systems as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref>). However, the influence of this gene expression heterogeneity on cell phenotype has not been clear and has often been modeled as a progressive accumulation of new functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref>). The phased changes in gene expression we defined in 1339-org cells suggested how trailblazer phenotypes evolved over time in response to TGFβ activity, with early onset gene expression changes inducing trailblazer cells that were further modulated by later stage reprogramming events <bold>(<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9</xref>)</bold>. Thus, differences between tumor cells in the duration of TGFβ pathway activation may contribute to the heterogeneity we detect in trailblazer populations. Interestingly, long-term TGFβ induced changes in gene expression that were associated with other cell lineages. This suggests that the enhanced invasion of trailblazer cells in response to persistent TGFβ stimulation may be associated with a more general lineage plasticity and not simply a re-balancing of epithelial and mesenchymal gene expression.</p>
<p>Our gene expression analysis and functional studies have begun to unravel the details of the transcriptional regulation of the trailblazer state. We detected an increase in Fra1, Zeb1 and Zeb2 expression in C3-TAg trailblazer cells and human breast cancer trailblazer cell lines, with Fra1 regulated by Egfr signaling and Zeb1 and Zeb2 regulated by Tgfβ. Fra1 and Zeb1 were required for the initial Tgfβ induced induction of a trailblazer invasion as well as invasion of cells after they had converted to trailblazer state. Interestingly, Zeb2, which showed a delayed induction in response to Tgfβ, was only required for the invasion of a trailblazer cell line with the characteristics of long-term Tgfβ pathway activation. These results suggest that the transcriptional regulation of trailblazer populations may be different depending on the specific trailblazer state. We also determined how siRNAs targeting 10 additional transcription factors, including the canonical EMT TFs Snail (Snai1), Slug (Snai2) and Twist1, influenced trailblazer cell invasion. The siRNAs targeting the 10 TFs did not yield a clear suppression of invasion and we did not detect a correlation between the increased expression of the TFs and the induction of a trailblazer state. However, our results do not exclude the possibility that these TFs contribute to the Tgfβ dependent induction of a trailblazer state in some context.</p>
<p>Our results revealed that a new compromise mode of integration between Tgfbr1 and Egfr regulated gene expression programs. The integration of parallel signaling pathways is frequently required to confer specific cell states and is typically classified from the standpoint of being a positive or negative interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref>). Indeed, prior studies have suggested that Tgfβ and Egfr-Ras regulated pathways positively integrate at the point of EMT-TF expression to initiate an EMT program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref>). While the combined activity of the Tgfbr1 and Egfr signaling pathways was necessary to induce a trailblazer state, there was an equivalent degree of positive and antagonistic interaction between the programs in C3-TAg tumor cells. This finding revealed a new type of integration between the two signaling programs in which the amplitude of a subset of the gene expression changes induced by either pathway alone are compromised. The selective activation and restriction of Tgfβ and Egf dependent gene expression suggests that compromise integration is dictated by differences in the expression or activity of co-factors that modulate chromatin accessibility or DNA binding. Tgfβ can increase Egfr expression and activate Erk1/2 signaling in a cell line dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">73</xref>). Similarly, Egfr-Mek1/2-Erk1/2 signaling can activate Tgfβ signaling through the phosphorylation of SMAD2/3 and increased expression of Tgfβ expression depending on cell context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">74</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">75</xref>). However, this manner of integration is unlikely contributing to the compromise integration in the C3-TAg tumor cells given that Tgfbr1 inhibition did not alter ERK1/2 phosphorylation or Fra1 expression and Egfr and Mek1/2 inhibition failed to impact Smad2/3 phosphorylation. The direct control of the activity of one pathway by the other would also be expected to yield a more uniform positive or negative integration. Defining the mechanistic basis of selective antagonism of gene expression by the Tgfβ and Egfr pathways is an important line of future investigation.</p>
<p>The requirement of Tgfβ and Egfr pathway activity for trailblazer cell invasion indicated that the compromise mode of integration was a feature of the trailblazer state. Egfr pathway stimulation can also promote the motility of non-trailblazer cells, raising the possibility that Egfr signaling has distinct functions in different subpopulations of invading cells, with the precise regulatory contribution dictated by Tgfβ pathway activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">76</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">77</xref>). The requirement of Tgfβ and Egfr signaling for the collective invasion of MCF10A-Trailblazer and MCFDCIS cells indicates that the integration of the pathways is essential for the induction of a trailblazer state in multiple contexts. However, the Egfr ligand Epgn restricts the invasion of luminal B PyMT organoids, potentially due to the ability of Epgn to suppress the expression of EMT-TFs and ECM reorganization genes in PyMT cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">78</xref>). This result suggests that integration of Egfr signaling is not essential for the induction of Krt14 specified trailblazer cells, like those detected in PyMT tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>). The differences in how Egfr signaling influences invasion may be a consequence of how tumor cells obtain the ability to resist TGFβ induced growth suppression and apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">79</xref>). This is accomplished either through the clonal selection of mutants that inactivate Tgfβ signaling, which does not occur in C3-TAg tumor cells, or an intrinsic reprogramming of cellular responses to TGFβ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">80</xref>). The type of reprogramming to TGFβ stimulation that is selected for during tumor progression may determine whether Tgfbr1 and Egfr signaling engage in a compromise mode of integration or if there is a predominantly positive or negative interaction between the pathways.</p>
<p>Our findings indicate that defining the nature of Tgfβ and Egfr pathway integration is necessary to understand tumor cell properties that influence metastasis and treatment response. In C3-TAg cells in which Tgfβ and Egfr activity combined to promote a trailblazer state, Egfr also restricted the expression of genes that could endow trailblazer cells with additional invasive and metastatic properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">81</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">84</xref>). Similarly, Tgfβ limited the Egf induced expression of chemokines that increase invasion and the recruitment of tumor promoting immune cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">85</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">86</xref>). Thus, the compromise mode of integration limited the expression of genes that could promote tumor progression whereas a strictly positive integration would have no such restrictions. The type of interaction between the Tgfβ and Egfr programs also influences the rationale for the therapeutic targeting of trailblazer cells. Inhibiting the Egfr pathway with the clinically approved drugs erlotinib and trametinib suppressed C3-TAg tumor cell invasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">87</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">89</xref>). However, combining either drug with newly developed anti-Tgfβ antibodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">90</xref>) may have additional benefit due to the fact that the Egfr and Tgfβ pathways function in parallel and each independently regulate large cohorts of genes. By comparison, cells in which Tgfβ activates Egfr-ERK1/2 signaling or vice versa may derive little or no benefit from combination therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">73</xref>). Thus, understanding how the mode of Tgfβ and Egfr pathway integration influences invasion, the risk of metastasis and options for treatment is an important line of future investigation.</p>
<p>Together, our results indicate that an improved understanding of how trailblazer cells are regulated and function in different breast cancer subtypes has the potential to improve the accuracy of patient diagnosis and reveal new treatment options.</p>

Immunofluorescence images were acquired using 10x/0.45 (Zeiss, 1 420640-9900-000) and 20x/0.8 (Zeiss, 1 420650-9902-000) objectives. For analysis of the relationship between Krt14 expression and invasion, organoids were classified as invasive if they had at least two protrusions with each protrusion having at least two cells invading outward from the center mass. Images were exported as TIFFs and analyzed with ImageJ. The freehand selection tool was used to define ROIs containing individual organoids for analysis. The Krt14 fluorescence for each organoid was then defined as the “Mean Gray Value”, as determined using the “Measure” function. To define Krt14 expression in cells leading invasion, &gt;10 organoids stained with Phalloidin, Hoechst, Krt14 and Krt8 were analyzed. Seven Z slices at 10 µm intervals over a total span of 100 µm were acquired, and the leading cells of each protrusion were designated as Krt14<sup>low</sup> or Krt14<sup>high</sup>. Vimentin and E-cadherin expression were analyzed in 5 µm histology sections. Organoids in 8-well chamber slides (Falcon, 354108) were washed 3x with distilled water. After detaching the chamber walls from the slides, the organoid/ECM gels were gently picked up using a single edge blade (Personna, 94-120-71) and laid out on a strip of parafilm (Bemis, PM-999). The 8-well chamber walls were placed around the gels and 150-200 µl of hydroxyethyl agarose processing gel (Thermo Fisher, HG 4000-012) was poured into the well. After the hydroxyethyl agarose processing gel solidified, it was transferred into histosettes (Simport, M498-3) and stored in 70% EtOH until embedding in paraffin by the Georgetown Histology and Tissue Shared Resource. The 5 µm sections were deparaffinized and immunostained as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>) to detect Vimentin and E-cadherin expression (<bold>Table S1</bold>). For individual organoids, Vimentin expression was defined as the “Mean Gray Value” using the “Measure” function in ImageJ. Using ImageJ, Vimentin expression was defined as the “Mean Gray Value” for individual organoids using the “Measure” function. For characterization of the trailblazer cell state, the cell leading a collectively invading group of cells was classified as a “trailblazer cell” while cells detached from the tumor organoid were classified as “single cells”. Each cell was assigned E-caderhin<sup>pos</sup>/ Vimentin<sup>neg</sup>, E-Cadherin<sup>pos</sup>/Vimentin<sup>pos</sup> or E-Caderin<sup>neg</sup>/ Vimentin<sup>pos</sup> status based on E-Cadherin and Vimentin expression.</p>

Normalized expression data was collapsed for all genes as the average between condition replicates and were subset to only include genes that were differentially expressed between at least one of the three conditions (control, growth factor, growth factor plus inhibitor) assessed. To define the integration between the pathways, we modified a previously described approach for generating polar plots that has been used to identify dynamic trends in gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c94">94</xref>). Relative mean signal changes over successive conditions, of control, growth factor, and growth factor plus inhibitor treatment (T°, T<sup>1</sup>, and T<sup>2</sup>, respectively), were transformed to an angle between −180 and +180 degrees (θ). This angle was further transformed to a scale from 0 to 360 degrees and then interpolated into a color based on the angle. Differentially expressed genes were plotted using polar coordinates (<italic>r</italic>,θ) with the radius (<italic>r</italic>), or distance from the focus, being equal to the value of largest absolute log<sub>2</sub> fold change between conditions and theta (θ) being equal to the angle corresponding to the trend of change and calculated using the following equations:

<p>The intensity (<italic>I</italic>) is equivalent to the maximum expression for a gene across conditions and the ratio (<italic>R</italic>) between the minimum expression of a gene across conditions over the intensity, are used to calculate the angle of expression trend (θ). As such, genes are plotted as a point with an angle (θ) corresponding to relative changes in a gene’s expression with subsequent treatments at a distance from the focus corresponding to the largest magnitude of change between any pair of conditions in the treatment series. Three-point profile annotations of expression change (corresponding from left to right as T°, T<sup>1</sup>, and T<sup>2</sup>, respectively) are indicated on the outer edge of the polar scatter plots every 30 degrees in the color assigned to that particular θ. These profiles are accompanied by a radial histogram denoting the density of differentially changed genes across organoid conditions at particular θ of the polar scatterplot.</p>
<p>To summarize the meaning of genes with particular profiles in the polar scatterplots, genes were grouped by profiles at 30-degree intervals starting at 0 degrees, which denotes genes that were unchanged in expression from T° to T<sup>1</sup> but demonstrated a significant increase in expression following growth factor plus inhibitor treatment of the organoids (T<sup>2</sup>). Genes from each group were assessed for enrichment of Gene Ontology biological processes (GP) using the EnrichGo function of the <italic>clusterProfiler</italic> package in R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c95">95</xref>).

<title>Statistical Methods</title>
<p>Data was analyzed with Prism 9.0.2 (Graphpad) and <italic>DESeq2, GSEA</italic> and <italic>ClusterProfiler</italic> packages in R. Data with a normal distribution, as determined by Shapiro-Wilk test, was analyzed by two tailed Student’s t-test. Data that did not pass a normality test were analyzed by Mann-Whitney U test or Kruskal Wallis test with Dunn’s Multiple comparison test. Differentially expressed genes with <italic>p</italic>&lt; 0.05 after Benjamini-Hochberg correction were identified using the <italic>DESeq2</italic> package in R. Fisher’s exact tests to determine the enrichment of Gene Ontology biological processes (BP) were performed using the EnrichGo function of the <italic>ClusterProfiler</italic> package in R. The specific statistical tests are indicated in the figure legends. Sample numbers are defined and indicated in the figure legends or on the figure panels. All experiments include a minimum of 2 biological replicates from separate biological preparations.</p>

<p>The study investigates the nature of &quot;trailblazer&quot; cells in distinct tumor models, including luminal B (MMTV/PyMT) and triple negative (TNBC) tumors (C3-TAg). The authors note that the trailblazer phenotypes in the TNBC model are more complex relative to the Luminal B model and represent distinct EMT programs associated with the expression of distinct EMT-TFs (Zeb1, Zeb2 and Fra-1). They demonstrated that of numerous EMT-TFs, Zeb1 and Fra-1 were required for increased cancer cell migration and invasion. They reveal that TGF-beta and EGF-mediated signaling are required for the diverse EMT states that are required for trailblazer cell activity and increased cell migration/invasion. TGF-beta signaling engaged Zeb 1 and Zeb2 while EGF signaling activated Fra-1. Indeed, inhibitors of either TGF-beta or EGF signaling could impair cell migration/invasion. While both pathways contributed to trailblazer phenotypes, EGF signaling was shown to interfere with certain TGF-beta induced transcriptional response, including the expression of genes encoding extracellular matrix proteins.</p>
<p>One concern was the heavy reliance of the C3-TAg as the sole TNBC model in which the distinct trailblazer phenotypes were described. The data in Fig. 3 of the submission reveals that the phenotypes observed in the C3-TAg model could be recapitulated in a TNBC patient-derived xenograft model (PDX). Using this PDX, the authors were able to show vimentin expression in lung metastatic TNBC cells that were intravascular, those that had extravasated and clusters of cancer cells fully within the lung parenchyma. This was an important addition to the manuscript. The additional experiments to investigate the role of Zeb1 and Zeb1 more fully, beyond the focus on Fra-1 in the initial submission was an additional strength of the new submission. Additional clarifications to the discussion also clarified the concepts articulated in the study. The study employs multiple breast cancer models, utilizes numerous in vitro and in vivo assessments of the trailblazer phenotypes, and the experimental design is rigorous and the interpretation of the data is sound. The manuscript will be of general interest to the research community.</p>

<p>This represents an important study that demonstrates a high degree of heterogeneity within trailblazer cells in clusters that participate in collective migration. Solid methods highlight this heterogeneity and show that in TNBC cancers, trailblazer cells are defined by vimentin (and not Keratin 14) and are dependent on both TGFbeta and EGFR signaling. Additional, single cell studies would further support this work.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The paper highlights that collective migration, and the nature of trailblazer cells can be highly heterogeneous. This is important as it suggests that the ability to move between states may supersede a singular phenotype.</p>
<p>The paper uses animal models and organoids and in several areas attempts to correlate findings to human tissues.</p>
<p>The experiments are logically described.</p>

<p>Cancer is a disease of many faces and in particular, the ability of cancers cells to change their phenotypes and cell behaviors - cancer cell plasticity - is a major contributor to cancer lethality and therapeutic challenge of treating this disease. In this study, Nasir, Pearson et al., investigate tumor cell plasticity through the lens of invasive heterogeneity, and in particular in models of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), a subtype of breast cancer with particularly poor clinical prognosis and more limited treatment modalities. Using organoid models in a variety of matrix systems, microscopy, and signaling pathway inhibitors, they find that invading TNBC breast tumors, primarily in the C31-Tag genetically engineered mouse model of TNBC, are composed of heterogeneous invasive/&quot;trailblazer&quot; type tumor cells that in many cases express vimentin, a classical intermediate filament marker of epithelial-mesenchymal transition, and reduced keratin-14, another filament marker of basal epithelial cells associated with collective invasion in different breast cancer models. Supportive genetic and pharmacologic evidence is provided that generation of these cells is TGF-beta signaling pathway driven, likely in vivo from the surrounding tumor microenvironment, in accord with published studies in this space. Another important aspect of this study is the good transcriptional evidence for multiple migratory states showing differing degrees of partial overlap with canonical EMT programs, dependent on TGF-beta, and suggestive but at present incomplete understanding of a parallel program involving Egfr/Fra-1 mediated effects on invasion. When taken in context with other recent studies (Grasset et al. Science Translational Medicine 2022), these data are broadly supportive of concept of targeting vimentin-dependent invasion programs in TNBC tumors.</p>
<p>The core conclusions of this paper are generally supported by the data, but there are some conceptual and technical considerations that should be taken into account when interpreting this study. Specific comments:</p>
<p>1. The contribution of the different vimentin-positive trailblazer cells to distant metastasis was not directly confirmed in vivo in this study. Given the limited proliferative potential of many fully EMT'd cells and in light of recent studies indicating that invasion can be uncoupled from metastatic potential, it seems important to directly test whether the different C31-tag isolates, varying in invasive potential in this study, produce metastases and if so do metastases abundance correlate with the invasive potential in 3D culture. The collection of lungs at 34 days post injection described in methods is too short to evaluate metastatic frequency.</p>
<p>2. The invasion of cancer cells is dependent on 3D matrix composition. In other studies, collective cancer invasion is performed in exclusively collagen type 1 gels or in other instances entirely in 3D reconstituted basement membrane gel, e.g. lung cancer invasion studies. In this study, the authors use a mixture composed of both matrices. Given the invasion suppressive effects of matrigel, particularly for epithelial type cells, further studies would be important to determine whether the invasion phenotypes seen in this study are generalizable across matrix environments.</p>
<p>3. TGF-beta is well known to induce EMT. Although this study identifies potential transcriptional mediators of the invasion/trailblazer program, is this program reversible?</p>

<p>The study investigates the nature of &quot;trailblazer&quot; cells in distinct tumor models, including luminal B (MMTV/PyMT) and triple negative (TNBC) tumors (C3-TAg). The authors note that the trail-blazer phenotypes in the TNBC model are more complex relative to the Luminal B model and represent distinct EMT programs associated with the expression of distinct EMT-TFs (Zeb1, Zeb2 and Fra-1). They demonstrated that of numerous EMT-TFs, Zeb1 and Fra-1 were required for increased cancer cell migration and invasion. They reveal that TGF-beta and EGF-mediated signaling are required for the diverse EMT states that are required for trailblazer cell activity and increased cell migration/invasion. TGF-beta signaling engaged Zeb 1 and Zeb2 while EGF sig-naling activated Fra-1. Indeed, inhibitors of either TGF-beta or EGF signaling could impair cell migration/invasion. While both pathways contributed to trailblazer phenotypes, EGF signaling was shown to interfere with certain TGF-beta induced transcriptional response, including the ex-pression of genes encoding extracellular matrix proteins.</p>
<p>One concern was the heavy reliance of the C3-TAg as the sole TNBC model in which the dis-tinct trailblazer phenotypes were described. The data in Fig. 3 of the submission reveals that the phenotypes observed in the C3-TAg model could be recapitulated in a TNBC patient-derived xenograft model (PDX). Using this PDX, the authors were able to show vimentin expression in lung metastatic TNBC cells that were intravascular, those that had extravasated and clusters of cancer cells fully within the lung parenchyma. This was an important addition to the manuscript. The additional experiments to investigate the role of Zeb1 and Zeb1 more fully, beyond the focus on Fra-1 in the initial submission was an additional strength of the new submission. Additional clarifications to the discussion also clarified the concepts articulated in the study. The study em-ploys multiple breast cancer models, utilizes numerous in vitro and in vivo assessments of the trailblazer phenotypes, and the experimental design is rigorous and the interpretation of the data is sound. The manuscript will be of general interest to the research community.</p>

<p>This represents an important study that demonstrates a high degree of heterogeneity within trailblazer cells in clusters that participate in collective migration. Solid methods highlight this het-erogeneity and show that in TNBC cancers, trailblazer cells are defined by vimentin (and not Keratin 14) and are dependent on both TGFbeta and EGFR signaling. Additional, single cell stud-ies would further support this work.</p>

<p>Thank you for the suggestion. Our current data establishes that trailblazer cells are heterogene-ous using FACS, immunostaining and functional studies of fresh tumor organoids and estab-lished tumor organoid lines. In addition, our RNA-seq experiments provided deep insight into the nature of gene expression changes that corresponded with the evolution of new trailblazer states. This discovery of trailblazer cell heterogeneity was one of multiple key new discoveries in this manuscript, along with revealing a Krt14-independent invasion mechanism, the regulation of trailblazer cells by Tgfβ and Egfr signaling and a new compromise mode of signal integration. We agree that our results support further investigation of the nature and function of basal-like breast cancer heterogeneity during the progression to metastasis. However, a comprehensive implementation of scRNA-seq is mostly likely required to further unravel new aspects of hetero-geneity that substantially advance upon the conclusions supported by our current data. Such an undertaking is beyond the scope of this investigation.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>We agree that scRNA-seq would be confirmatory of trailblazer cell heterogeneity that has been demonstrated with multiple approaches rather than a new discovery of heterogeneity.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The paper highlights that collective migration, and the nature of trailblazer cells can be highly heterogeneous. This is important as it suggests that the ability to move between states may su-persede a singular phenotype.</p>
<p>The paper uses animal models and organoids and in several areas attempts to correlate find-ings to human tissues.</p>
<p>The experiments are logically described.</p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Cancer is a disease of many faces and in particular, the ability of cancers cells to change their phenotypes and cell behaviors - cancer cell plasticity - is a major contributor to cancer lethality and therapeutic challenge of treating this disease. In this study, Nasir, Pearson et al., investigate tumor cell plasticity through the lens of invasive heterogeneity, and in particular in models of tri-ple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), a subtype of breast cancer with particularly poor clinical prognosis and more limited treatment modalities. Using organoid models in a variety of matrix systems, microscopy, and signaling pathway inhibitors, they find that invading TNBC breast tu-mors, primarily in the C31-Tag genetically engineered mouse model of TNBC, are composed of heterogeneous invasive/&quot;trailblazer&quot; type tumor cells that in many cases express vimentin, a classical intermediate filament marker of epithelial-mesenchymal transition, and reduced keratin-14, another filament marker of basal epithelial cells associated with collective invasion in differ-ent breast cancer models. Supportive genetic and pharmacologic evidence is provided that gen-eration of these cells is TGF-beta signaling pathway driven, likely in vivo from the surrounding tumor microenvironment, in accord with published studies in this space. Another important as-pect of this study is the good transcriptional evidence for multiple migratory states showing dif-fering degrees of partial overlap with canonical EMT programs, dependent on TGF-beta, and suggestive but at present incomplete understanding of a parallel program involving Egfr/Fra-1 mediated effects on invasion. When taken in context with other recent studies (Grasset et al. Science Translational Medicine 2022), these data are broadly supportive of concept of targeting vimentin-dependent invasion programs in TNBC tumors.</p>
<p>The core conclusions of this paper are generally supported by the data, but there are some conceptual and technical considerations that should be taken into account when interpreting this study. Specific comments:</p>
<p>1. The contribution of the different vimentin-positive trailblazer cells to distant metastasis was not directly confirmed in vivo in this study. Given the limited proliferative potential of many fully EMT'd cells and in light of recent studies indicating that invasion can be uncoupled from meta-static potential, it seems important to directly test whether the different C31-tag isolates, varying in invasive potential in this study, produce metastases and if so do metastases abundance corre-late with the invasive potential in 3D culture. The collection of lungs at 34 days post injection de-scribed in methods is too short to evaluate metastatic frequency.</p>

<p>We agree that it is important to determine the contribution of trailblazer cells towards metastatic dissemination. In this manuscript, we show that Vimentin expressing cells in a triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) PDX model disseminate to the lungs (Figure 3F). We have also shown that Vimentin expressing SUM159 breast cancer (BC) trailblazer cells spontaneously metasta-size to the lungs in previous publications (Fig. 2–figure supplement 1C) and (Westcott et al, J Clin Invest, 2015, 10.1172/JCI77767 and Maine et al, Oncotarget, 2016, 10.18632/oncotarget.7408). Notably, the depletion of genes specifically expressed in trailblazer cells reduced spontaneous metastasis without significantly impinging on primary tumor growth (Westcott et al, J Clin Invest, 2015, 10.1172/JCI77767 and Maine et al, Oncotarget, 2016, 10.18632/oncotarget.7408). Our new results in Figure 5D show that Tgfβ activates genes that define the trailblazer state in the metastatic SUM159 trailblazer cell model. Thus, features of the Tgfβ regulated trailblazer program in the C3-TAg cells is active in the SUM159 trailblazer model of spontaneous metastasis.  In addition, commonly employed BC cell line metastasis models, such as MDAMB231 derivatives are highly mesenchymal (Fig. 2–figure supplement 1C) and (Kang et al, Cell, 2003, 10.1016/S1535-6108(03)00132-6 and Minn et al, Nature, 2005, 10.1038/nature03799, as examples).</p>
<p>It is not technically feasible to establish a correlation between the relative invasion of The C3-TAg GEMM primary tumors and spontaneous metastasis. C3-TAg GEMM primary tumors de-velop rapidly and the mice must be euthanized prior to the detection of metastasis. This limitation of the model is mentioned in the Results section “Trailblazer cells are specified by Vimentin ex-pression in basal-like breast cancer patient tumors”. The aggressive primary tumor growth and limited spontaneous metastasis of the the C3-TAg model has also been previously reported by others (Green et al, Oncogene, 2000, 10.1038/sj.onc.1203280). Surgical resection of the original primary tumor is not feasible option to allow metastases to form since additional tumors develop in multiple mammary glands.</p>
<p>In response to reviewer requests, we initiated the growth of orthotopic primary tumors from con-trol or Tgfβ treated 1339-org cells to address the relationship between induction of the trailblazer state and primary tumor cell dissemination. We had to euthanize the mice at day 34 (d34) be-cause tumors within both cohorts had reached the maximum permitted diameter of 2 cm. This will be indicated in the Methods section with revised text. We detected CTCs from the mice bearing control and Tgfβ treated 1339-org cell tumors. However, no micrometastases were de-tected, which is indicated in the text describing Figure 4–figure supplement 3A-B. Thus, per-forming surgical resection in new experiments would not be expected to allow the later detection of metastasis, as there did not appear to be DTCs in the lungs that could initiate colonization. In addition, we would have to resect the tumors prior to d34 to successfully and humanely remove the primary tumors, further reducing the odds of metastases developing. We will continue our work to identify an experimental balance that permits sufficient primary tumor growth to initiate spontaneous metastasis. However, the time scale of resolving this technical challenge is uncer-tain and we believe that our published analysis of trailblazer cell metastasis and new findings here showing the dissemination of Vimentin expressing cells in a PDX model addresses the question of whether Vimentin expressing trailblazer cells metastasize.</p>
<p>We agree that certain cell states induced by EMT programs can limit the proliferative potential of tumor cells. As described in the Introduction, we previously found that the induction of a trailblaz-er state in a subset of breast cancer cell line models triggers a collateral cost in fitness that limits the ability of trailblazer cells to initiate tumor growth (Westcott et al, Cancer Res, 2020, 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-20-0014). The traits that distinguish trailblazer cells which are capable of tumor initiation and metastasis versus trailblazer cells with reduced fitness have begun to be delineated. Our prior report suggested that cells that were dependent on p63 for growth lost their proliferative capacity when converting to a trailblazer state (Westcott et al, Cancer Res, 2020, 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-20-0014). C3-TAg cells are not dependent on p63 for growth, which is indicated by the vast majority of the tumor cells lacking p63 expression in primary tumors and primary tumor organoids (Westcott et al, Cancer Res, 2020, 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-20-0014), similar to the metastatic SUM159 breast cancer cell line model. We were also able to derive clonal trailblazer cell lines that lacked detectable p63 expression from a C3-TAg tumor (Figure 2—figure supplement 1B) and grow organoids even when the limited extent of p63 expression was further reduced by Tgfβ (Figure 5C). Additionally, the persistent Tgfβ treated 1339-org cells, which were enriched for trailblazer cells and had reduced p63 expression, were capable of initiating primary tumor growth (Figure 4F). Together, these results indicate that C3-TAg trail-blazer cells are capable of initiating metastatic colonization. However, given the heterogeneity in trailblazer states that we discovered, it is possible that a subset of trailblazer cell states have re-duced proliferative capacity. Our analysis approach in this manuscript would not necessarily de-tect these low fitness trailblazer cells if they were a relatively small fraction of the total trailblazer population. We will clarify this point in the Discussion section in the revised manuscript. Our re-sults have begun to reveal mechanisms for the transcriptional regulation of trailblazer cell heter-ogeneity. We plan to continue delineating the regulatory programs conferring specific transcrip-tion state, defining approaches for the prospective isolation of distinct trailblazer subpopulations and determining trailblazer subpopulation specific biomarkers to understand the specific contri-bution of distinct trailblazer subpopulations towards metastasis. Given the scope of this analysis, it is not feasible to incorporate these future studies into this manuscript.</p>

<p>1. The invasion of cancer cells is dependent on 3D matrix composition. In other studies, collec-tive cancer invasion is performed in exclusively collagen type 1 gels or in other instances entirely in 3D reconstituted basement membrane gel, e.g. lung cancer invasion studies. In this study, the authors use a mixture composed of both matrices. Given the invasion suppressive effects of matrigel, particularly for epithelial type cells, further studies would be important to determine whether the invasion phenotypes seen in this study are generalizable across matrix environ-ments.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The invasion of C3-TAg and PyMT organoids embedded in a 100% pure reconstituted base-ment is shown in Fig. 1–figure supplement 1G. We will emphasize that trailblazer invasion was evaluated in multiple ECM compositions with revised text and figure graphic. We also provide images for the reviewer showing that C3-TAg organoids collectively invade in a pure Collagen I ECM. Importantly, these findings are consistent with our results showing that Vimentin express-ing cells are associated with basal-like mammary tumor cell invasion in the complex ECM of C3-TAg GEMM primary tumors (Figure 2G) and patient primary tumors (Figure 3D). Moreover, Vimentin expressing cells disseminated to the lungs in the TNBC PDX that we evaluated (Figure 3F).</p>
<p>The ECM composition selected for experiments is dictated by the experimental question(s) being addressed. It is unlikely that mammary tumor cells would only ever collectively invade through an ECM that is either pure Collagen I or pure reconstituted basement membrane (BM). Indeed, it has been proposed that mixtures of Collagen I and BM proteins best reconstitute the complexity of primary tumor ECM (Hooper et al, Methods Enzymol, 2006, 10.1016/S0076-6879(06)06049-6). In line this observation, mixtures of Collagen I and BM proteins have been routinely used for the past 20 years to define mechanisms of 3D invasion; Xiang and Muthuswamy, Methods En-zymol, 2006, 10.1016/S0076-6879(06)06054-X; Calvo et al, Nat Cell Biol, 2013 10.1038/ncb2756; and Kato et al, eLife, 2023, 10.7554/eLife.76520, as examples).</p>
<p>Consistent with the known complexity of the ECM in the tumor microenvironment (TME), we detect Collagen I and Collagen IV (a key component of experimental BM) in the TME of primary breast cancer tumor models (Westcott et al, J Clin Invest, 2015, 10.1172/JCI77767). Important-ly, we have found that a mixture of collagen I and experimentally derived BM proteins reliably reveals breast cancer trailblazer cell invasion mechanisms that promote the malignant progres-sion and metastasis of primary tumors and whose expression correlates with poor patient out-come (Westcott et al, J Clin Invest, 2015, 10.1172/JCI77767 and Westcott et al, Cancer Res, 2020, 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-20-0014, as examples). Notably, the relative differences in trail-blazer and opportunist cell invasive phenotypes are not dictated by the ECM composition used in our 3D assays. We have previously tested the invasion of trailblazer and opportunist subpopula-tions in different ECM compositions using both spheroid vertical invasion assays (Westcott et al, J Clin Invest, 2015, 10.1172/JCI77767). Increasing collagen I concentration enhanced the rela-tive rate of trailblazer cell invasion, with trailblazer cells always showing a significantly enhanced invasion relative to opportunist cells.</p>
<p>The relationship between trailblazer and opportunist cells that we have detected in primary tu-mors is recapitulated when using mixtures of Collagen I and BM proteins in our past publications and in this manuscript. The clonal opportunist cell lines derived from a C3-TAg tumor expressed high levels of the transcription factor p63 (Figure 2–figure supplement 1A-B). We previously showed that p63 restricts induction of a trailblazer state in human breast cancer trailblazer cell lines (Westcott et al, Cancer Res, 2020, 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-20-0014). Notably, we showed that p63 expressing C3-TAg cells were not able to initiate collective invasion in the same ECM composition used in our current manuscript. Moreover, p63 cells in primary C3-TAg tumors were noninvasive opportunist cells that were limited to trailing p63-low trailblazer cells when collective-ly invading in primary tumors and in organoids (Westcott et al, Cancer Res, 2020). We now show that p63 expressing opportunist cell lines are limited to invading behind primary C3-TAg trailblazer cells and trailblazer cell lines in our 3D invasion assays (Figure 1B and Figure 1–figure supplement 1D-E). Together, these results indicate that the ECM employed in our 3D assays reveals the mechanistic underpinnings of both trailblazer and opportunist cell invasion in primary tumors.</p>
<p>With respect to lung cancer invasion, leader cells that we would classify as trailblazer cells have been isolated from 2 non-small cell lung cancer cell line spheroid models grown in pure reconsti-tuted BM extract (Konen et al, Nat Comm, 2017, 10.1038/ncomms15078). However, it unclear whether these cell line derived NSCLC trailblazer cells are more intrinsically invasive than non-trailblazer siblings in primary NCSCLC tumors or if the traits associated cell line NSCLC trail-blazer cells are required for metastasis. These tests have never been reported to the best of our knowledge. Similarly, it is not clear whether these NSCLC cell line derived trailblazer cells reflect features of primary NSLC primary tumor cells, as we are unaware of any such comparisons be-ing reported. Thus, there is no reason to consider pure reconstituted BM to be an equivalent or preferred experimental option to define trailblazer cell features. Nevertheless, as we mentioned before, our discovery approach identifies trailblazer cells that are intrinsically more invasive than opportunist siblings across multiple ECM conditions, including pure reconstituted BM and, im-portantly, in primary tumors.</p>

<p>1. TGF-beta is well known to induce EMT. Although this study identifies potential transcriptional mediators of the invasion/trailblazer program, is this program reversible?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have previously shown the breast cancer trailblazer cells can convert to an opportunist state, demonstrating that trailblazer states are reversible (Westcott et al, J Clin Invest, 2015, 10.1172/JCI77767). In this manuscript.  we show that C3-TAg organoid lines derived in the Tgfbr1 inhibitor A83-01 have few if any cells with a trailblazer phenotype relative to C3-TAg pri-mary tumors, suggesting a reversion of the trailblazer state (Fig. 4C and Figure 4–figure sup-plement 2A-C). However, our results do not entirely rule out the possibility that only non-trailblazer cells grew to establish the organoid lines. Indeed, the problem of tracing phenotypic conversions when evaluating heterogeneous populations is a systemic challenge that extends beyond our analysis of trailblazer cells. Clearly defining the conversion rates for trailblazer cells will require multiple genetic markers to distinguish the different trailblazer states we have now identified, in addition to phenotypic and molecular analysis over multiple days, or possibly weeks. Thus, further definition of the rate of reversion of different trailblazer cells is worthy line of future investigation rather than a feasible objective of this study.</p>
