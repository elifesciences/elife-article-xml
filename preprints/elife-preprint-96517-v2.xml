<title>Abstract</title>
<p>When an animal invests space, materials and energy in an eye to meet behavioural needs, the eye’s optics and photoreceptor array compete for these resources to improve the eye’s performance. To discover how this competition influences eye design, we introduce a new and superior measure of cost, specific volume in µm<sup>3</sup> sr<sup>−1</sup>, that depends on the dimensions of the eye’s components, applies to both optics and photoreceptor array, accounts for space, materials and energy (including photoreceptors’ high metabolic rates), and links investments to an eye’s performance via optical, physiological and geometrical constraints. Specific volume enables us to construct a performance surface across the morphospace of an eye of given type and total cost by modelling all of its configurations and determining each model’s information capacity. We model three eye types, neural superposition and fused-rhabdom apposition compound eyes and a simple (camera type) eye, across a 10<sup>5</sup>-fold range of total cost. Performance surfaces are flat-topped, therefore the optimum configuration lies in a broad high-efficiency zone within which eyes adapted for specific tasks loose &lt;5% of information. This robust region will increase adaptability by reducing loss of function. Comparing optimised models: simple eye information capacity increases as (total cost)<sup>0.8</sup> and (total cost)<sup>0.55</sup> in apposition eyesm and simple eyes are x10 to x100 more efficient than apposition eyes of the same total cost. In both eye types 30%-80% of total cost is invested in photoreceptor arrays, optimum photoreceptor length increases with total cost and is reduced by photoreceptor energy consumption. Simple eyes’ photoreceptors are much shorter than apposition eyes’ and their length more sensitive to energy consumption. We analyse published data that cover the same range of total specific volumes. The apposition eyes of fast-flying diurnal insects follow three trends predicted by our models: photoreceptor arrays are allocated 40% - 80% of total specific volume, spatial resolution and photoreceptor length increase with increasing specific volume, and apposition photoreceptors are much longer than simple. We conclude that photoreceptor costs are considerable and often exceed optical costs. Thus, competition between optics and photoreceptors for resources helps determine eye design, photoreceptor energy cost plays a major role in determining an eye’s efficiency and design, and matching investments in optics and photoreceptors to improve efficiency is a design principle. Our new methodology can be developed to view the adaptive radiation of eyes through a cost-benefit lens.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The design of eyes has long fascinated biologists with its variations, innovations, numerous adaptations of form to function, and insights into the evolution of organs, both rudimentary and perfectly contrived (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Darwin, 1859</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Land &amp; Fernald, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Nilsson &amp; Land, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Oakley &amp; Speiser, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c101">Walls, 1942</xref>). We address a question of eye design that has not been considered before, but is familiar to people who construct imaging systems on tight budgets. How should the resources invested in an eye be divided between an eye’s two major components, the optical system that forms images and the photoreceptor array that captures images?</p>
<p>The benefits of enlarging the dioptric apparatus and the photoreceptor array are well understood, consequently numerous studies relate measures of eye morphology (radius, width, length, lens diameter, pupil area, and photoreceptor length) to optical, geometrical and physiological constraints on performance to show how morphology adapts an eye to lifestyle and habitat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Barlow, 1952</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Kirschfeld, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Labhart &amp; Nilsson, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Land, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Land, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Nilsson &amp; Land, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Niven et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Snyder, 1979</xref>; K. N. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c95">Thomas et al., 2020</xref>). However, the fact that an eye’s performance depends on two systems that effectively compete for the resources invested in an eye, the dioptric apparatus and the photoreceptor array, is rarely considered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Kirschfeld, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Kröger &amp; Biehlmaier, 2009</xref>). We investigate how trade-offs between dioptrics and photoreceptor array determine an eye’s performance and efficiency by developing a new cost-benefit approach, which uses measures of eye morphology to calculate costs, and relates these measures to optical, geometrical and physiological constraints to calculate benefits.</p>
<p>We consider three basic eye types, two types of apposition compound eye, neural superposition and fused rhabdom, and a simple eye (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). We establish and road test our cost-benefit approach using apposition compound eyes because they offer a unique combination of advantages. The optical and physiological constraints are well documented, their effects on performance are measured and modelled, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Hardie &amp; Postma, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Heras &amp; Laughlin, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Howard et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Snyder, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Song et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">Stavenga, 2004b</xref>) and their influence on eye design is well established. For example, the compound eyes of housefly, praying mantis, dragonfly and robber fly have foveas for detecting, locating and catching flying mates or prey. Here the facet lens are enlarged to reduce the diffraction limit to optical resolving power, the ommatidia are more densely packed to increase angular resolution, and photoreceptors are elongated to increase signal to noise ratio by transducing more photons (B. G. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Burton &amp; Laughlin, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Hardie, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Labhart &amp; Nilsson, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Rossel, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c102">Wardill et al., 2017</xref>). In addition, there are clear indications that photoreceptors are costly and investments in optics and photoreceptors are matched. Apposition eyes’ photoreceptor arrays obviously fill a substantial fraction of eye volume because photoreceptors construct long photoreceptive waveguides (rhabdomeres, rhabdoms), substantial photoreceptor energy costs increase with rhabdomere length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Niven et al., 2007</xref>), and there is a precise, fine scale covariation of acuity and photoreceptor length, measured in two apposition eyes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Labhart &amp; Nilsson, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Rossel, 1979</xref>) and obvious in many others (e.g. <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1b</xref>).</p>

<p>Our new cost-benefit approach establishes that photoreceptor cost is a major factor in eye design that influences optics by competing for the resources invested in an eye. Consequently matching investments in optics and photoreceptors to improve efficiency is a principle of eye design. This principle can explain why apposition eyes have longer photoreceptors than simple eyes and photoreceptor length increases with spatial acuity in apposition and simple eyes. We suggest that our approach can advance our understanding of visual ecology by costing the benefits of the adaptions observed in eyes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Cronin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Nilsson &amp; Land, 2012</xref>). Moreover, because the allocation of resources to optics and photoreceptors both promotes cost-effectiveness, and depends upon developmental and physiological mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Casares &amp; McGregor, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Niven &amp; Laughlin, 2008</xref>), our cost-benefit approach may well contribute to our understanding of how and why eyes evolve (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Nilsson &amp; Pelger, 1994</xref>).</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>We start with the neural superposition (NS) eyes of flies. This type of apposition compound eye provides both the detailed analyses of optical and physiological constraints required to develop a model that relates investments in optics and photoreceptor arrays to performance, and the published data on dioptrics and photoreceptor arrays required to test our model. Moreover, because fly NS eyes vary in size between species while retaining similar structure and function we simplify our study by developing and using a generic fly NS model. We then model and examine fused rhabdom apposition eyes to identify general principles of apposition eye design. Finally we model a simple (camera) eye to demonstrate that changing eye type changes the distribution of costs. In all three types, we consider diurnal eyes operating in daylight when the number of available photons is not limiting. Although this restriction eliminates the many ways in which eyes are designed to operate efficiently at lower light levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Nilsson &amp; Land, 2012</xref>), it makes it easier to establish points of principle by reducing the numbers of variables in our models.</p>
<sec id="s3a">
<title>Calculating the benefits and costs of investing in optics</title>
<p>In daylight, when the number of available photons is not limiting, investments in optics buy increased optical contrast and spatial resolving power by reducing optical and geometrical constraints, as follows. An apposition eye forms and captures images with an array of ommatidia (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). Each ommatidium uses a facet lens of diameter, <italic>D</italic>, and focal length (in air), <italic>f</italic> , to focus light onto the entrance aperture of photoreceptive waveguides, a single fused rhabdom or several rhabdomeres (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>) of diameter <italic>d</italic><sub><italic>rh</italic></sub> . Increasing <italic>D</italic> sharpens a photoreceptor’s angular sensitivity by reducing the blur produced by the Airy disk diffraction pattern, whose half-width <italic>Δρ</italic><sub><italic>L</italic></sub> = <italic>λ/D</italic> radians, where <italic>λ</italic> is the wavelength of light, taken to be 500 nm. Increasing <italic>f</italic> and reducing <italic>d</italic><sub><italic>rh</italic></sub> also sharpen angular sensitivity by reducing the angular subtense of the photoreceptor entrance aperture, <italic>d</italic><sub><italic>rh</italic></sub><italic>/f</italic> . Sharpening angular sensitivity has two benefits: it increases spatial resolving power and increases image contrast.</p>
<p>We calculate the effects of <italic>D, d</italic><sub><italic>rh</italic></sub> and <italic>f</italic> on the half-width of a fly photoreceptor’s angular sensitivity, <italic>Δρ</italic>, using two formulae, Snyder’s simplification, his Convolution of Gaussians <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="576511v2_inline1.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>, where <italic>Δρ</italic><sub><italic>L</italic></sub> = <italic>λ/D</italic> and <italic>Δρ</italic><sub><italic>rh</italic></sub> = <italic>d</italic><sub><italic>rh</italic></sub><italic>/f</italic> ; and Stavenga’s better approximation, <italic>Δρ</italic> = 1.26<italic>Δρ</italic><sub><italic>L</italic></sub>, obtained using a comprehensive wave-optics model (WOM) of flies’ NS eyes operating in bright light (see Methods for more details). For CoG we fix <italic>d</italic><sub><italic>rh</italic></sub> = 1.9 µm because this value is typical of fly R1-6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Hardie, 1985</xref>). CoG provides a lower bound to optical resolving power and WOM a more efficient upper bound that, in bright light, makes better use of investments in optics by operating closer to the diffraction limit.</p>
<p>The benefits of investing in optics come at a cost: increasing <italic>D</italic> and lengthening <italic>f</italic> to reduce <italic>Δρ</italic> expands the volume of the dioptric apparatus, <italic>V</italic><sub><italic>o</italic></sub>, which in apposition eyes is easily calculated from eye geometry (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1e</xref>). <italic>D</italic> and <italic>Δϕ</italic> define the radius <italic>R</italic> = <italic>D/Δϕ</italic> of a locally spherical eye region, in which the dioptric apparatus (lens, cone and screening pigment) is a shell of thickness <italic>f</italic><sup><italic>′</italic></sup>, the focal distance from lens front surface to focal plane. Thus
<disp-formula id="eqn1">
<graphic xlink:href="576511v2_eqn1.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
Because <italic>V</italic><sub><italic>o</italic></sub> is a specific measure, volume per unit solid angle of visual space, we can compare investments in eye regions that differ in radius and angular extent. Thus <italic>V</italic><sub><italic>o</italic></sub> handles the regional variations in <italic>R</italic> observed in many compound eyes.</p>
<p>To simplify our expression for <italic>V</italic><sub><italic>o</italic></sub> (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn1">Equation 1</xref>) we fix lens F-number, <italic>F</italic> = <italic>f/D</italic> and apply the formula for image formation by a convex cornea, <italic>f</italic><sup><italic>′</italic></sup> = <italic>f</italic>.<italic>n</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> where <italic>n</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> is the refractive index of the internal medium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Nilsson &amp; Land, 2012</xref>). This formula describes several apposition eyes, including fly NS eyes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Rossel, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Stavenga, 2003a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">Stavenga et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c109">Zeil, 1983</xref>). Thus
<disp-formula id="eqn2">
<graphic xlink:href="576511v2_eqn2.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
We use values measured in blowfly, <italic>F</italic> = 2.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Stavenga, 2003a</xref>) and <italic>n</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>, = 1.34, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Seitz, 1968</xref>).</p>
<p>Fixing <italic>F</italic> both simplifies our models by reducing the number of free parameters and accounts for the dependence of the photon flux entering an ommatidium on <italic>D</italic> by making image brightness (the flux per unit area of rhabdomere entrance aperture) independent of <italic>D</italic>. We use the specific volume of optics, <italic>V</italic><sub><italic>o</italic></sub>, as our measure of the cost of optics, <italic>C</italic><sub><italic>o</italic></sub> µm<sup>3</sup> sr<sup>−1</sup>. This usage assumes that the cost of materials, the cost of metabolic energy for maintaining function, and the energy cost of carriage all increase in equal proportion to volume, in all parts of the dioptric apparatus, namely the corneal lens, cone, and surrounding pigment cells. Given the lack of definitive data on composition and costs, this assumption is a reasonable starting point (Discussion).</p>

<title>Calculating the benefits and costs of investing in photoreceptors</title>
<p>Investing in photoreceptors buys photoreceptor signal to noise ratio, <italic>SNR</italic><sub><italic>ph</italic></sub>, by reducing the effects of an optical constraint, the Poisson statistics of photon absorption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Nilsson &amp; Land, 2012</xref>), and at higher light levels a physiological constraint, the saturation of a photoreceptor’s transduction units - its light sensitive microvilli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Heras &amp; Laughlin, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Howard et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Song et al., 2012</xref>). A microvillus contains rhodopsin molecules, the intermediate molecules of the phototransduction cascade and the ion channels they activate, and it uses these to generate a brief pulse of depolarising current, a quantum bump, following the activation of a single rhodopsin molecule by an absorbed photon. This all-or-none response takes time to complete, during which the microvillus cannot respond to the absorption of another photon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Hardie &amp; Postma, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Song &amp; Juusola, 2014</xref>). Therefore, as light intensity rises to daylight levels, <italic>SNR</italic><sub><italic>ph</italic></sub> falls below the Poisson limit because a photoreceptor’s transduction units saturate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Howard et al., 1987</xref>). At any given time a significant fraction of microvilli are failing to respond to the absorption of a photon by rhodopsin because they are already engaged in processing a bump. Consequently the transduction rate <italic>ψ</italic> no longer increases linearly with the absorption rate, and bump statistics change from Poisson to binomial. In daylight, flies activate a photomechanical response, a longitudinal pupil, to prevent excessive saturation and maintain <italic>SNR</italic><sub><italic>ph</italic></sub> close to the maximum permitted by binomial statistics,

where <italic>SNR</italic><sub><italic>ph</italic></sub> is defined with respect to a signal of unit contrast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Howard et al., 1987</xref>). Note that by operating at this upper limit the fly obtains maximum benefit from investing in <italic>N</italic><sub><italic>vil</italic></sub>. Thus the benefit of investing in a longer rhabdomere is an increase in <italic>SNR</italic><sub><italic>ph</italic></sub> in bright light, according to

</disp-formula>
where <italic>L</italic> is rhabdomere length and <italic>ν</italic> is the number of microvilli per unit length. We assume <italic>ν</italic> is constant along the rhabdomere and from published results we estimate <italic>ν</italic> = 230 µm<sup>−1</sup> (Methods).

<p>The cost of increasing <italic>SNR</italic><sub><italic>ph</italic></sub> by increasing <italic>L</italic> is easily calculated.

Thus in a locally spherical eye region (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>) the photoreceptor array’s specific volume is

<p>For the photoreceptor array we assume that the costs of space, materials and energy for carriage increase in proportion to volume with the same constants of proportionality as optics. Again, in the absence of measurements this assumption is a reasonable starting point (Discussion). However, this assumption breaks down when we consider specific metabolic rates. To enable and power phototransduction, a photoreceptor has an exceptionally high specific metabolic rate (energy consumed per gram, and hence unit volume, per second) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Laughlin et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Niven et al., 2007</xref>; Pangršič et al., 2005). We account for this extra cost by applying an energy surcharge, <italic>S</italic><sub><italic>E</italic></sub>. To equate with our other estimates of cost this surcharge has units of µm<sup>3</sup> sr<sup>−1</sup>, and we assume that it increases in proportion to <italic>N</italic><sub><italic>vil</italic></sub> because <italic>N</italic><sub><italic>vil</italic></sub> determines the magnitude of the photoreceptor’s light-gated conductance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Hardie &amp; Postma, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Heras &amp; Laughlin, 2017</xref>). We satisfy these two requirements by defining
<disp-formula id="eqn8">

</disp-formula>
where <italic>K</italic><sub><italic>E</italic></sub>, the photoreceptor energy tariff, converts the energy consumed by a photoreceptor per microvillus into an equivalent volume.</p>
<p>We estimate <italic>K</italic><sub><italic>E</italic></sub> (Methods) by adopting the method used to estimate the energy cost of weapons carried by flying beetles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Goyens et al., 2015</xref>). We divide the energy consumed per microvillus by the animal’s mass specific metabolic rate, SMR, to obtain an equivalent body mass which, assuming a density of 1.0, is our volume equivalent, <italic>K</italic><sub><italic>E</italic></sub> µm<sup>3</sup> per microvillus. <italic>K</italic><sub><italic>E</italic></sub> is at present poorly determined: it depends upon several ecological, physiological and behavioural factors, it will vary among species and among individuals of the same species, and there is barely enough data (Methods). Given this uncertainty, we model a range of values from <italic>K</italic><sub><italic>E</italic></sub> = 0 to <italic>K</italic><sub><italic>E</italic></sub> = 0.64 that covers the range we estimate for blowfly, <italic>K</italic><sub><italic>E</italic></sub>= 0.13 to <italic>K</italic><sub><italic>E</italic></sub> = 0.52 (Methods).</p>

<p>Having used constraints to link investments in dioptrics and photoreceptor array to three major determinants of the quality of the achromatic images captured by fly photoreceptors R1-6, namely <italic>Δρ, Δϕ</italic> and <italic>SNR</italic><sub><italic>ph</italic></sub>, we can now model how trade-offs between optics and photoreceptors change an eye’s ability to support vision. Several measures of visual performance depend on <italic>Δρ, Δϕ</italic> and <italic>SNR</italic><sub><italic>ph</italic></sub>. To establish proof of principle we use a general measure that embraces a wide variety of resolvable achromatic image details - spatio-temporal information capacity in bits sr<sup>−1</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>. Information capacity has proved useful for measuring the performance of compound eyes (de Ruyter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">van Steveninck &amp; Laughlin, 1996</xref>), discovering design principles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Howard &amp; Snyder, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Snyder et al., 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c97">van Hateren, 1992</xref>), and illuminating the evolution of simple eyes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Nilsson &amp; Pelger, 1994</xref>). The measure is particularly relevant for a fly NS eye because coding by second order neurons is adapted to maximise information capacity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Laughlin, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c97">van Hateren, 1992</xref>).</p>
<p>To model the effects of resource allocation on information capacity, we fix <italic>C</italic><sub><italic>tot</italic></sub> and generate pairs of <italic>D</italic> and <italic>L</italic> that cover the range of values permitted by eye geometry. Each <italic>D, L</italic> pair specifies an investment in optics, <italic>C</italic><sub><italic>o</italic></sub>(<italic>D, L</italic>), an investment in photoreceptors <italic>C</italic><sub><italic>ph</italic></sub>(<italic>D, L</italic>) and hence the three determinants of image quality, <italic>Δρ</italic>(<italic>D, L</italic>), <italic>Δϕ</italic>(<italic>D, L</italic>), and <italic>SNR</italic><sub><italic>ph</italic></sub>(<italic>D, L</italic>), that specify spatio-temporal information capacity <italic>H</italic>(<italic>D, L</italic>) bits sr<sup>−1</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>.</p>
<p>We calculate <italic>H</italic>(<italic>D, L</italic>) (Methods) in the frequency domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Howard &amp; Snyder, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c97">van Hateren, 1992</xref>). In brief, a 2-D power spectrum typical of natural scenes is low-pass filtered by the photoreceptor angular sensitivity function, <italic>Δρ</italic>(<italic>D, L</italic>), and sampled by an hexagonal lattice of photoreceptors specified by <italic>Δϕ</italic>(<italic>D, L</italic>). Movement of the retinal image modulates the flux of photons entering a photoreceptor by converting spatial frequencies into temporal frequencies, according to the distribution of angular velocities generated during behaviour. Then during transduction, the photoreceptors low-pass filter these temporal frequencies and add the noise generated by sampling the photon flux stochastically with transduction units (microvilli). We use van Hateren’s (1992) formulae for the 1<italic>/f</italic> <sup>2</sup> power spectrum of natural scenes and the distribution of image velocities appropriate for blowfly, and we temporally low pass filter according to the measured properties of a fully light-adapted blowfly photoreceptor R1-6 (Methods). We also modify van Hateren’s method to take account of the spatial aliasing that occurs when an array of ommatidia undersamples an image (Methods).</p>
<p>By calculating information capacities for each <italic>D, L</italic> pair we define the performance surface <bold><italic>H</italic>(<italic>D, L</italic>)</bold> that covers the morphospace of model eyes of given Fnumber, <italic>F</italic> , and specific cost, <italic>C</italic><sub><italic>tot</italic></sub>. The performance surface is a flat-topped ridge with steep flanks (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). Atop the ridge, a single point of maximum capacity, <italic>H</italic>(<italic>D</italic><sub><italic>opt</italic></sub>, <italic>L</italic><sub><italic>opt</italic></sub>), sits in an extensive zone within which capacity, and hence efficiency, is <italic>&gt;</italic> 95% maximum (red zone in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). With efficiency dropping steeply away from the ridge, approximately two thirds of <italic>D, L</italic> combinations have efficiencies <italic>&lt;</italic> 70%. The shape of the performance surface depends upon photoreceptor energy cost (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). Increasing the energy tariff <italic>K</italic><sub><italic>E</italic></sub> reduces <italic>L</italic><sub><italic>opt</italic></sub> from the maximum permitted by eye geometry to one quarter of maximum. However, because the ridge is flattopped, <italic>L</italic><sub><italic>opt</italic></sub> still lies in an extensive high-efficiency zone, within which <italic>L</italic> can be changed three-fold and <italic>D</italic> by 40%, while maintaining <italic>&gt;</italic> 95% efficiency (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). This broad high-efficiency zone is bad news for investigators who set out to establish that eyes are optimised, but good news for insects. An eye region can be adapted for a specific purpose, e.g. by increasing <italic>L</italic> to increase <italic>SNR</italic>, without sacrificing more than 5% of a measure of general-purpose vision, information capacity. Thus this robust region of design space can facilitate evolution by reducing loss of function.</p>

Careful interrogation of our MATLAB code suggests that coding and rounding errors are not responsible for these jumps.

<p>The 12 eye regions provide a well-distributed set of empirical values of <italic>L, D, Δϕ, V</italic><sub><italic>o</italic></sub>, <italic>V</italic><sub><italic>ph</italic></sub> and <italic>V</italic><sub><italic>tot</italic></sub> that spans almost five orders of magnitude of <italic>V</italic><sub><italic>tot</italic></sub>, from 1.4 <italic>×</italic> 10<sup>6</sup> µm<sup>3</sup> sr<sup>−1</sup> and 2.1 <italic>×</italic> 10<sup>6</sup> µm<sup>3</sup> sr<sup>−1</sup> for the low acuity eye region of the March fly <italic>Dilophus febrilis</italic> and the eye of <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> respectively, to 9 <italic>×</italic> 10<sup>10</sup> µm<sup>3</sup> sr<sup>−1</sup> for the remarkable fovea of the small robber fly <italic>Holcocephala fusca</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c102">Wardill et al., 2017</xref>).</p>
<p>We compare the empirical values obtained from flies with theoretical curves, obtained from model NS eyes that are optimised for information capacity (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>). Note that for our theoretical curves we plot <italic>D, Δϕ, L</italic> and <italic>V</italic><sub><italic>ph</italic></sub> against total specific cost, <italic>C</italic><sub><italic>tot</italic></sub> µm<sup>3</sup> sr<sup>−1</sup> (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>). This total includes the surcharge for photoreceptor energy consumption <italic>S</italic><sub><italic>E</italic></sub> µm<sup>3</sup> sr<sup>−1</sup>, which increases in proportion to the number of microvilli and the photoreceptor energy tariff, <italic>K</italic><sub><italic>E</italic></sub> (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn8">Equation 8</xref>). However, we cannot estimate <italic>C</italic><sub><italic>tot</italic></sub> in flies because their values of <italic>K</italic><sub><italic>E</italic></sub> are not well-determined (Methods). Although <italic>K</italic><sub><italic>E</italic></sub> will vary considerably between species, we only have enough published data to calculate its order of magnitude and likely range (Methods). Furthermore, <italic>K</italic><sub><italic>E</italic></sub> is species-specific and, because we have no more than two data points per species and we are using a generic model that does not account for differences in <italic>d</italic><sub><italic>rh</italic></sub> and <italic>F</italic> among species (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>), we cannot estimate <italic>K</italic><sub><italic>E</italic></sub> by fitting our model to the empirical data. For these reasons we compare theoretical findings to empirical data by plotting them against a measure of eye size that is both calculated by our models and estimated from data, total specific volume, <italic>V</italic><sub><italic>tot</italic></sub>. Because <italic>K</italic><sub><italic>E</italic></sub> is uncertain, we plot theoretical curves calculated with values of <italic>K</italic><sub><italic>E</italic></sub> from within our likely range.</p>

<p>Looking across 12 fly eye regions, <italic>D</italic> increases and <italic>Δϕ</italic> decreases as <italic>V</italic><sub><italic>tot</italic></sub> increases. <italic>D</italic> lies within, or close to, the theoretical envelope defined by CoG models optimised with <italic>K</italic><sub><italic>E</italic></sub> = 0 and <italic>K</italic><sub><italic>E</italic></sub> = 0.32 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5a</xref>), and tends to slightly exceed optimum values at lower specific volumes. <italic>Δϕ</italic> is approximately 25% wider than optimum (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5b</xref> ) in the four eye regions with lowest specific volume and close to optimum elsewhere. The eye parameter, <italic>p</italic> = <italic>DΔϕ</italic>, (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5c</xref> ) indicates the degree to which an apposition compound eye sacrifices spatial resolution by sampling below the lens diffraction limit. Only <italic>Holcocephala</italic> fovea, <italic>p</italic> = 0.37, comes close to the diffraction limit <italic>p</italic> = 0.29 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Snyder, 1979</xref>). As observed in a number of diurnal apposition eyes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c103">Wehner, 1981</xref>), the remaining 11 fly eye regions in our data set undersample by a factor of 2 or more, with <italic>p</italic> decreasing with increasing <italic>V</italic><sub><italic>tot</italic></sub> from 1.4 to 0.65 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5c</xref> ). Our optimised models also undersample, with <italic>p</italic> decreasing with increasing <italic>V</italic><sub><italic>tot</italic></sub> from 0.89 to 0.65 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5c</xref> ). Note that like <italic>D</italic> and <italic>Δϕ, p</italic> is relatively insensitive to <italic>K</italic><sub><italic>E</italic></sub>. We conclude that in most eye regions <italic>p</italic> is not optimised for spatio-temporal information capacity, at least according to our model, because it is higher than predicted at all but the highest values of <italic>V</italic><sub><italic>tot</italic></sub>.</p>
<p>Rhabdomere length, <italic>L</italic>, increases with <italic>V</italic><sub><italic>tot</italic></sub> from 60 µm to 340 µm (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5d</xref>; <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>), within or close to the theoretical envelope defined by <italic>K</italic><sub><italic>E</italic></sub> = 0 and <italic>K</italic><sub><italic>E</italic></sub> = 0.16. There is a robust trend: the empirical values of log <italic>L</italic> increase with log <italic>V</italic><sub><italic>tot</italic></sub>, and hence with increasing <italic>D</italic> and decreasing <italic>Δϕ</italic> (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5a,b</xref>), along a trajectory that resembles theoretical curves for optimum log <italic>L</italic>. However, the data do not follow the theoretical curve for any particular value of <italic>K</italic><sub><italic>E</italic></sub>, and there is some scatter among the data points (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5d</xref>). We have three reasons to attribute most of this scatter to unknown differences in <italic>K</italic><sub><italic>E</italic></sub>. First, the optimum value of <italic>L</italic> is sensitive to <italic>K</italic><sub><italic>E</italic></sub> (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4c</xref>); second, <italic>K</italic><sub><italic>E</italic></sub> will vary between species (Methods); and third, the empirical values of <italic>D</italic> and <italic>Δϕ</italic>, which are in theory relatively insensitive to <italic>K</italic><sub><italic>E</italic></sub>, are less scattered and lie closer to our theoretical predictions (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5a,b</xref>). The one obvious outlier, the shorter than predicted rhabdomeres in <italic>Holcocephala</italic> fovea (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5d</xref>), is easily explained: the optics and photoreceptor array of this forward pointing fovea, together with underlying optic lobe, are tightly packed into a head that is less than 600 µm from front to back (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c102">Wardill et al., 2017</xref>), and this lack of headroom limits the depth of the eye, (<italic>L</italic> + <italic>f</italic><sup><italic>′</italic></sup>).</p>
<p>The log-log plot of <italic>L</italic> versus <italic>D</italic> (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5e</xref> ) shows that the increase in <italic>L</italic> with <italic>V</italic><sub><italic>tot</italic></sub> is not explained by proportional scaling because the empirical values do not lie on a straight line of slope 1, <italic>L</italic> = k<italic>D</italic>. As expected of a physiological system subject to several competing constraints (G. K. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93">Taylor &amp; Thomas, 2014</xref>), the theoretical curve continuously changes slope, and this is reflected in the data. Thus the matching of <italic>L</italic> to <italic>D</italic> and <italic>Δϕ</italic> observed in the data is not the consequence of a simple developmental constraint, it is the product of developmental mechanisms that allocate resources efficiently to optics and photoreceptor array.</p>
<p>We conclude that the eye regions we analyse are, according to our generic model, not optimised for spatio-temporal information capacity because the data points that are least sensitive to the photoreceptor energy tariff <italic>K</italic><sub><italic>E</italic></sub>, namely <italic>D, Δϕ</italic> and <italic>p</italic>, are generally larger than predicted. Nonetheless, we argue on two grounds that the matching of rhabdomere length to spatial resolution seen in flies promotes the efficiency of their total investments in eye. <italic>L</italic> lies within, or close to, the theoretical envelope predicted by models optimised for efficiency, and because the theoretical performance surface has a wide flat high-efficiency zone (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>), large deviations from optimum have relatively little impact on efficiency.</p>
<p>To accommodate photoreceptors’ lengthy rhabdomeres, flies allocate between 56% and 78% of eye volume, <italic>V</italic><sub><italic>tot</italic></sub>, to photoreceptor arrays (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5f</xref>). The smaller remainder, between 44% and 22%, is allocated to optics. There is a slight trend for the percentage allocated to photoreceptors to increase with <italic>V</italic><sub><italic>tot</italic></sub>. With the exception of <italic>Holcocephala</italic>’s fovea, where the depth of the photoreceptor array is much less than predicted for optimum allocation, the volumes allocated to photoreceptor arrays lie within or close to the theoretical envelope defined by <italic>K</italic><sub><italic>E</italic></sub> = 0 and <italic>K</italic><sub><italic>E</italic></sub> = 0.16. On this basis we conclude that our diurnal flies allocate a larger fraction of eye volume to photoreceptors than to optics, and this allocation promotes the efficient use of resources. Thus photoreceptor costs are playing a major role in determining the design and efficiency of flies’ NS eyes.</p>

<title>Fused rhabdom apposition eyes show similar patterns of investment</title>
<p>We investigate diurnal apposition eyes with fused rhabdoms by modifying our NS eye model and comparing theoretical results with empirical data using the procedures developed for NS eyes.

These values are in the middle of the wide range found in our sample of apposition eye regions (<xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). We also adjust the relationship between <italic>L</italic> and the number of microvilli <italic>N</italic><sub><italic>vil</italic></sub> to account for a fused rhabdom (Methods). For simplicity we assume that all photoreceptors contribute equal numbers of microvilli along the full length of the rhabdom so that <italic>N</italic><sub><italic>vil</italic></sub> increases in proportion to the depth of the photoreceptor array.</p>

<p>Looking across our limited sample of fused rhabdom apposition eyes, <italic>D</italic> increases with <italic>V</italic><sub><italic>tot</italic></sub>, <italic>Δϕ</italic> decreases, and <italic>L</italic> increases from 280 µm to 1100 µm (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6a,b,c</xref>). These empirical values are more widely scattered than those for NS eyes (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5a,b,d</xref>), and the discrepancies between empirical and predicted values are larger. We expect a wider scatter because our sample of fused rhabdom eyes is more diverse than our sample of NS eyes, both structurally and phylogenetically. In addition, the scatter is dominated by regional differences within eyes (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>), several of which adapt a region for a specific task. For example, the 1100 µm rhabdomeres of the dragonfly <italic>Sympetrum</italic>, which are the longest photoreceptive waveguides found in any eye, adapt the fovea for detecting small prey against a bright blue sky by enhancing <italic>SNR</italic><sub><italic>ph</italic></sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Labhart &amp; Nilsson, 1995</xref>). Despite the scatter in data points, fused rhabdom eyes follow the trends seen in NS eyes (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref> c.f. <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>). In most eye regions, <italic>D</italic> and <italic>Δϕ</italic> are larger than predicted by models optimised for efficiency (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6a,b</xref>), so therefore is the eye parameter <italic>p</italic> (values not plotted). At low <italic>V</italic><sub><italic>tot</italic></sub>, <italic>L</italic> lies within the theoretical envelope defined by models run with plausible values of photoreceptor energy tariff, <italic>K</italic><sub><italic>E</italic></sub>. However, at higher specific volumes <italic>L</italic> falls increasingly short (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6c</xref>). As with flies’ NS eyes, large investments are made in photoreceptor arrays. The volume fractions of photoreceptor arrays increase from 33% <italic>V</italic><sub><italic>tot</italic></sub> to 75% <italic>V</italic><sub><italic>tot</italic></sub> as <italic>V</italic><sub><italic>tot</italic></sub> increases, and the majority of values lie between 40% <italic>V</italic><sub><italic>tot</italic></sub> and 60% <italic>V</italic><sub><italic>tot</italic></sub> (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6d</xref>). Our information maximisation models predict an increase from 33% <italic>V</italic><sub><italic>tot</italic></sub> to 85% <italic>V</italic><sub><italic>tot</italic></sub>.</p>
<p>Our models also give the relative contribution of photoreceptor cost to total cost when fused rhabdom apposition eyes are optimised for spatial information capacity. The percentage of total investment devoted to the photoreceptor array increases with the energy tariff <italic>K</italic><sub><italic>E</italic></sub> and climbs steadily with increasing <italic>C</italic><sub><italic>tot</italic></sub>, from 43% to more than 80% (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6e</xref>). As in NS eyes, the contribution of photoreceptor energy consumption to array cost is progressively marginalised by array volume cost as <italic>C</italic><sub><italic>tot</italic></sub> increases, falling to less than 20% in the largest eyes (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6f</xref>).</p>
<p>We conclude that the 16 eye regions in our sample of fused rhabdom apposition eyes are not optimised for spatio-temporal information capacity, at least according to our models. However, the regions exhibit three trends that are associated with efficient resource allocation - rhabdomeres are relatively long, length increases with acuity, and the photoreceptor array occupies a large fraction of eye volume. These trends suggest that, as in NS eyes, resources are being divided between optics and photoreceptor array to promote efficiency, consequently photoreceptor costs play a major role in the design of fused-rhabdom apposition eyes.</p>

<title>Patterns of efficient investment are different in simple eyes</title>
<p>To further investigate how investment patterns differ according to eye type, we construct a basic hemispherical model of a simple eye with rhabdomeric photoreceptors (Methods; <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7a</xref>) that captures the equivalence of <italic>D, f</italic><sup><italic>′</italic></sup> and <italic>Δϕ</italic> in apposition and simple eyes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Kirschfeld, 1976</xref>).

</fig>
<p>For each <italic>C</italic><sub><italic>tot</italic></sub> there is an optimum division of resources between optics and photoreceptors that maximises information capacity. <italic>L</italic><sub><italic>opt</italic></sub> increases with <italic>V</italic><sub><italic>tot</italic></sub>, scaling close to (<italic>C</italic><sub><italic>tot</italic></sub>)<sup>1<italic>/</italic>3</sup> (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7b</xref>). Increasing the energy tariff, <italic>K</italic><sub><italic>E</italic></sub>, greatly reduces <italic>L</italic><sub><italic>opt</italic></sub> without changing this scaling exponent. At any given <italic>C</italic><sub><italic>tot</italic></sub> and <italic>K</italic><sub><italic>E</italic></sub>, <italic>L</italic><sub><italic>opt</italic></sub> is much shorter in simple eyes and the difference increases with <italic>C</italic><sub><italic>tot</italic></sub> from at least 50% shorter at <italic>C</italic><sub><italic>tot</italic></sub> = 1 <italic>×</italic> 10<sup>6</sup> µm<sup>3</sup> sr<sup>−1</sup> to over 90% shorter at <italic>C</italic><sub><italic>tot</italic></sub> = 1 <italic>×</italic> 10<sup>9</sup> µm<sup>3</sup> sr<sup>−1</sup>. We conclude that, in theory, efficient resource allocation explains why photoreceptors in diurnal simple eyes have much shorter light-sensitive waveguides than photoreceptors in diurnal apposition eyes.</p>
<p>Patterns of investment differ from apposition eyes in other respects (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>). In simple models the optimum volume fraction of the photoreceptor array is insensitive to <italic>C</italic><sub><italic>tot</italic></sub> whereas in apposition models it increases with <italic>C</italic><sub><italic>tot</italic></sub>. In addition, a simple eye is much more sensitive to photoreceptor energy consumption. The small energy tariff, <italic>K</italic><sub><italic>E</italic></sub> = 0.04, reduces simple eye array volume from 35% <italic>V</italic><sub><italic>tot</italic></sub> to 12% <italic>V</italic><sub><italic>tot</italic></sub>, but has a negligible effect on an NS eye. Raising the tariff to <italic>K</italic><sub><italic>E</italic></sub> = 0.32, reduces the simple eye’s array volume to just 3% <italic>V</italic><sub><italic>tot</italic></sub> but in apposition models it is always &gt;30% <italic>V</italic><sub><italic>tot</italic></sub>. Despite this ten-fold reduction in %<italic>V</italic><sub><italic>tot</italic></sub> the total resources allocated to photoreceptor array increases from 35% to 57% (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7d</xref>) because the relative contribution of photoreceptor energy consumption increases from 40% <italic>C</italic><sub><italic>tot</italic></sub> to 55% <italic>C</italic><sub><italic>tot</italic></sub>. Finally, in simple eyes the relative contribution of photoreceptor energy consumption is insensitive to <italic>C</italic><sub><italic>tot</italic></sub>, but in apposition models it falls steadily with increasing <italic>C</italic><sub><italic>tot</italic></sub>, to around 5% <italic>C</italic><sub><italic>tot</italic></sub> (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7d</xref>). This difference between eye types can be attributed to differences in eye geometry (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7a</xref>). As <italic>C</italic><sub><italic>tot</italic></sub> increases, the simple eye maintains its dense packing of photoreceptors but an apposition eye’s photoreceptors become increasingly widely spaced as larger lenses force the boundaries between ommatidia further apart. We conclude that when resources are efficiently allocated, the differences in geometry that define eye type can profoundly influence both the impact of photoreceptor energy consumption on eye morphology and the distribution of costs within an eye.</p>

<title>Information capacity and investment</title>
<p>In all optimised eye models, apposition and simple, the spatio-temporal information capacity, <italic>H</italic><sub><italic>opt</italic></sub>, increases sub-linearly with total investment, <italic>C</italic><sub><italic>tot</italic></sub>, (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8a</xref>), making a bit of information more expensive in a larger eye.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We initiate a new approach to understanding eye design by investigating how the division of resources between an eye’s dioptric apparatus and photoreceptor array influences an eye’s performance and efficiency. To achieve this we formulate a new measure of cost, specific volume, that is defined by an eye’s shape and the dimensions of its components, can be adjusted to account for the high energy cost of photoreceptors, and relates investments in optics and investments in photoreceptors to three basic determinants of image quality, interreceptor angle <italic>Δϕ</italic>, photoreceptor acceptance angle <italic>Δρ</italic>, and photoreceptor signal to noise ratio <italic>SNR</italic><sub><italic>ph</italic></sub>, via optical, geometrical and physiological constraints. These advantages allow us to model how an eye’s performance changes when resources are transferred between optics and photoreceptors. Thus we can, for the first time, model performance across the morphospace of an eye of given type and total cost. Using a general-purpose measure of performance, spatio-temporal information capacity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Howard &amp; Snyder, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c97">van Hateren, 1992</xref>), we find that the surface for an apposition compound eye (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>) is flat topped - the optimum configuration that maximises performance sits in a broad high efficiency zone in which performance over 95% of maximum. Within this robust region of morphospace an eye, or eye region, can be specialised for a specific task with little loss of information, and this can facilitate evolution by reducing loss of function. Our models predict that efficiently configured diurnal apposition eyes invest heavily in deep photoreceptor arrays with long rhabdomeres and rhabdoms, and match investments in optics and photoreceptor arrays so that rhabdom(ere) length increases with spatial resolution (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>). By applying our new method of costing investments to published data, we show that fast-flying diurnal insects conform to these trends and are, therefore, configured to be efficient (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5</xref>, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). Our models also demonstrate that photoreceptor energy consumption is an important factor in an apposition eye’s design and performance: it reduces photoreceptor length by as much as 90% and information capacity by as much as 60%. To see how resource allocation and performance depend on eye type we model a simple (camera type) eye (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>). When optimised for efficiency, a simple eye has much shorter photoreceptors and its structure and function are more sensitive to photoreceptor energy demands: photoreceptors length is greatly reduced by and information capacity decreases by as much as 90% (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figures 7</xref>, <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>). We conclude that when apposition and simple eyes are designed to use resources efficiently, the cost of the photoreceptor array is as significant as the cost of optics, and matching investments in optics and photoreceptor arrays to increase efficiency is a principle of eye design. Our analysis, which is the first to account for the costs of both optics and photoreceptor array, indicates that one benefit of investing in an eye, the ability to gather more information follows the law of diminishing returns. As expected from its superior geometry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Kirschfeld, 1976</xref>), a simple eye is in theory a better investment: its information capacity increases as (total cost)<sup>0.8</sup>, compared with (total cost)<sup>0.55</sup> for an apposition eye, and the simple eye is 10 to 100 times more efficient at gathering information (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref>). We now discuss the validity of our methodology, the robustness of our findings, and their contributions to our understanding of eye design and evolution.</p>

<title>Specific volume is a useful measure of cost</title>
<p>This new measure of cost has several advantages. First, specific volume is defined by dimensions and angles that are measured anatomically and optically (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn1">Equations 1</xref>, 2, 5, 6) and relates directly to benefits via optical, geometrical and physiological constraints on spatial acuity and sensitivity. Thus, like previous indicators of cost - eye radius, eye length, pupil area and corneal area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Brandon et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Brandon &amp; Dudycha, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Snyder et al., 1977</xref>; K. N. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c95">Thomas et al., 2020</xref>; R. J. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c96">Thomas et al., 2004</xref>) - specific volume can evaluate investments and trade-offs that adapt eyes for specific purposes. Second, specific volume is more flexible and far reaching than previous indicators of cost because it can be applied to eyes that are not well approximated by solid spheres. Third, it applies to small eye regions. Fourth, it provides a common currency for comparing investments in different eyes, eye regions, and components within an eye (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5</xref>, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>, <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>). This facility enables one to investigate how and why resources are distributed across visual fields and, as we demonstrate here, evaluate trade-offs between investments in an eye’s components. Given that biological processes and systems evolve to become more cost-efficient because costs depress fitness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Alexander, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Niven &amp; Laughlin, 2008</xref>; G. K. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93">Taylor &amp; Thomas, 2014</xref>), we suggest a fifth advantage: specific volume will help us understand how eyes are adapted and evolve.</p>
<p>How well does specific volume represent costs? Volume accurately measures one limiting resource, space, but because there are insufficient data, we have to make assumptions to calculate the costs of energy and materials. Assuming that the densities of an eye’s cells, extracellular materials and fluid-filled cavities are close to 1, space is a reasonable proxy for three costs that increase in proportion to mass: the energy expended carrying an eye (carriage cost), materials, and cellular energy consumption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c106">Witter &amp; Cuthill, 1993</xref>).</p>
<p>Equating mass and carriage cost is a reasonable starting point. Experiments on individual animals - a human walker carrying a backpack (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Bastien et al., 2005</xref>), a flightless ant carrying nectar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Duncan &amp; Lighton, 1994</xref>), and a flying beetle carrying a heavy weapon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Goyens et al., 2015</xref>) - show that the cost of carrying an additional load is the load’s mass times the individual’s mass specific metabolic rate when moving unloaded.</p>
<p>Turning to the costs of the materials and energy used within the eye, there is no data for an apposition eye’s dioptric apparatus. Nonetheless, its corneal lenses, pigment cells, and cones cells are densely packed with macromolecules, and because their optical function is passive (they refract and absorb) they contain very few, if any, mitochondria. Indeed, the corneal cuticle and the fluid filled pseudo-cone of fly NS eye are extracellular (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Hardie, 1985</xref>). Thus, the assumption that the costs of materials and energy for the dioptric apparatus increase in fixed proportion to volume is a reasonable starting point.</p>
<p>Cost estimates can be adjusted for situations in which costs per unit volume are not equal, as illustrated by our treatment of photoreceptor energy consumption. To support transduction the photoreceptor array has an exceptionally high metabolic rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Laughlin et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Niven et al., 2007</xref>; Pangršič et al., 2005). We account for this higher energy cost by using the animal’s specific metabolic rate (power per unit mass and hence power per unit volume) to convert an array’s power consumption into an equivalent volume (Methods). Photoreceptor ion pumps are the major consumers of energy and the smaller contribution of pigmented glia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Coles, 1989</xref>) is included in our calculation of the energy tariff <italic>K</italic><sub><italic>E</italic></sub> (Methods). The higher costs of materials and their turnover in the photoreceptor array can be added to the energy tariff <italic>K</italic><sub><italic>E</italic></sub> but given the magnitude of the light-gated current (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Laughlin et al., 1998</xref>) the relative increase will be very small. Thus, for our intents and purposes the effects of these additional costs are covered by our models. For want of sufficient data, <italic>K</italic><sub><italic>E</italic></sub> is uncertain, therefore we model a reasonable range of values (Methods). Because the optimum eye configuration is most sensitive to <italic>K</italic><sub><italic>E</italic></sub> in the lower half of this range (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4</xref>, <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>), we are unlikely to seriously underestimate the effects of photoreceptor costs on eye morphology and efficiency.</p>

<title>Matching photoreceptor length to spatial acuity</title>
<p>The systematic increase in rhabdomere or rhabdom length, <italic>L</italic>, with spatial acuity observed in apposition eyes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1</xref>, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>) and simple eyes (see below), and predicted by our models (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4</xref>, <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>), is an obvious manifestation of efficient resource allocation. Two studies of apposition eyes, one of dragonfly and the other of praying mantis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Labhart &amp; Nilsson, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Rossel, 1979</xref>), map the covariation of lens diameter, <italic>D</italic>, interommatidial angle, <italic>Δϕ</italic>, and rhabdom length, <italic>L</italic>, across an entire eye. Both show that when acuity is increased by enlarging the dioptric apparatus and increasing ommatidial density, i.e. by reducing <italic>Δϕ, L</italic> is increased to improve <italic>SNR</italic><sub><italic>ph</italic></sub>. In both insects <italic>L</italic> peaks in a fovea that is used to detect and capture prey, and in dragonfly dorsal fovea the 1.1 mm rhabdomeres (the longest light sensitive waveguides reported in any eye, diurnal or nocturnal) are adapted to improve the detection and localisation of small flying prey (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Labhart &amp; Nilsson, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Rigosi et al., 2017</xref>). However, specialisation for prey capture is unlikely to explain why <italic>L</italic> varies systematically with acuity across an entire eye.</p>
<p>We find that the trend to increase rhabdomere length with acuity is more generally advantageous. The trend is widespread: looking across 28 eye regions drawn from 10 species of fast flying insect, <italic>L</italic> increases with acuity over a 25-fold range of interommatidial angle (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5</xref>, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). Modelling shows that matching <italic>L</italic> to acuity improves a general measure of performance, spatial information capacity and the widespread covariation of <italic>L</italic> and acuity observed in apposition eyes follows the trend predicted by modelling (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5</xref>, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). Finally, because information capacity captures the interplay between three basic determinants of image quality, <italic>Δρ, Δϕ</italic> and <italic>SNR</italic><sub><italic>ph</italic></sub>, several tasks could benefit from an increase in <italic>L</italic> with acuity.</p>
<p>Other factors can link <italic>L</italic> to acuity. One possibility, developmental constraints impose inflexible scaling relationships on apposition eyes, can be dismissed. Scaling changes across apposition compound eyes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Perl &amp; Niven, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Scales &amp; Butler, 2016</xref>; G. J. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c94">Taylor et al., 2019</xref>), and our empirical log-log plots of <italic>L</italic> v.s. eye volume and <italic>L</italic> v.s. <italic>D</italic> continuously change slope (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5d,e</xref>), as required for the efficient allocation of resources (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4c</xref>). Head size is an obvious constraint: smaller insects have smaller heads, consequently they will tend to have smaller eyes with lower acuity and shorter rhabdom(ere)s. The strongest evidence that lack of headroom reduces the length of photoreceptors comes from the fovea of a small insect, <italic>Holcocephala</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c102">Wardill et al., 2017</xref>), that is adapted for exceptionally high acuity (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>; <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5d</xref>). One must also consider the costs associated with enlarging the head by adding more eye, such as mechanical support, wind resistance, and conspicuousness. We suggest that more comparative studies are required to establish the influence of head size on eye design.</p>
<p>Then there is the difference in <italic>L</italic> that is so obvious and widespread that it has been accepted without question - <italic>L</italic> is generally much longer in diurnal apposition eyes than in diurnal simple eyes. Comparing eyes with rhabdomeric photoreceptors, <italic>L</italic> ranges from 60 µm to 1100 µm in apposition eyes (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Tables 2</xref> &amp; 3), and from 10 µm to 90 µm, in spiders’ simple eyes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Land, 1985</xref>). Efficient resource allocation provides an explanation: optimised simple eye models predict that <italic>L</italic> is approximately x10 shorter than in apposition compound eyes of the same cost (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7b</xref>). <italic>L</italic> also increases with acuity (increasing <italic>D</italic> and decreasing <italic>Δϕ</italic>) in optimised simple eye models and there is evidence that this matching occurs in diurnal spiders. <italic>L</italic> increases with increasing <italic>D</italic> when comparing eyes in different species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Land, 1985</xref>), different eyes in the same individual, and the same eye increasing in size and acuity as a juvenile spider grows to adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Gote et al., 2019</xref>). However, more accurate models of these spiders’ eyes are needed prove that this co-variation is increasing efficiency. The degree to which the lengthening of cone outer segments in primate fovea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Provis et al., 2013</xref>) increases the efficiency of resource utilisation is also an open question. A critical ingredient, a physiological constraint that links investments in outer segments to noise levels in full daylight, has yet to be identified in ciliary photoreceptors. In addition, the economics of vertebrate simple eyes differs from invertebrate simple eyes in two ways. First, a vertebrate outer segment is almost 10 times more effective at absorbing photons because its folded sheets of membrane pack visual pigment molecules more densely than arrays of tubes (microvilli) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Fain et al., 2010</xref>). Second, photoreceptors compete with neural circuits for resources within the eye (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Kröger &amp; Biehlmaier, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">Sterling &amp; Laughlin, 2015</xref>).</p>

<title>Photoreceptor costs are a major factor in eye design</title>
<p>In apposition eye models optimised for spatio-temporal information capacity more than 40% of total investment, <italic>C</italic><sub><italic>tot</italic></sub>, is allocated to photoreceptor arrays (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4e</xref>, 6e) and, in line with this theoretical finding, our analysis of data from diurnal insects shows that arrays occupy 30% to 75% of eye volume (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5f</xref>, 6d). For simple eye models the efficient allocation is 30% to 60% of <italic>C</italic><sub><italic>tot</italic></sub> (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7d</xref>). Our modelling identifies roles for two types of array cost, the rarely considered costs associated with array volume (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Baden &amp; Nilsson, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Kirschfeld, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Kröger &amp; Biehlmaier, 2009</xref>), and the well-known energy costs associated with phototransduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Ames, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Fain &amp; Sampath, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Laughlin et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Okawa et al., 2008</xref>; Pangršič et al., 2005). We find that this energy cost greatly influences the configuration of an efficient eye: increasing the energy tariff <italic>K</italic><sub><italic>E</italic></sub> reduces array depth, <italic>L</italic>, as much as tenfold (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4c</xref>, 5d, 6c, 7b). Reducing <italic>L</italic> reduces <italic>SNR</italic><sub><italic>ph</italic></sub> (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn4">Equation 4</xref>), however the <italic>SNR</italic><sub><italic>ph</italic></sub> that remains is worth paying for because the %<italic>C</italic><sub><italic>tot</italic></sub> allocated to photoreceptor energy consumption increases (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4f</xref>, 7e). We conclude that because <italic>SNR</italic><sub><italic>ph</italic></sub> is valuable, photoreceptor costs are always significant and this necessitates efficient resource allocation. It follows that photoreceptor costs influence the morphologies of both photoreceptor array and dioptric apparatus because optics and array compete for the resources invested in an eye.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4d">
<title>The impact of photoreceptor costs depends on eye type</title>
<p>Photoreceptor energy cost has more impact on both the total cost and the design of a simple eye than an equivalent apposition compound eye because the simple eye has more photoreceptors per unit volume (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7a</xref>). Applying our lowest energy tariff, <italic>K</italic><sub><italic>E</italic></sub> =0.04 µm<sup>3</sup> per microvillus, to an optimised apposition eye model has almost no effect on the depth of the photoreceptor array, <italic>L</italic>, but in the optimised simple eye model it reduces <italic>L</italic> by more than 80%, and array volume by more than 60% (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7c</xref>). Despite this shrinkage, investment in the simple eye model’s photoreceptor array increases from 35% <italic>C</italic><sub><italic>tot</italic></sub> to 50% <italic>C</italic><sub><italic>tot</italic></sub> because energy costs have risen from 30% <italic>C</italic><sub><italic>tot</italic></sub> to 55% <italic>C</italic><sub><italic>tot</italic></sub> (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7d</xref>). Also, in simple eye models the percentages of <italic>C</italic><sub><italic>tot</italic></sub> allocated to the photoreceptor array volume and energy change very little as <italic>C</italic><sub><italic>tot</italic></sub> increases, whereas in apposition eyes the relative contribution of photoreceptor energy consumption falls steeply as photoreceptors become increasingly widely spaced (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7a</xref>). Thus the distribution of costs within an efficiently configured eye changes with eye type, according to the eye’s typical geometry .</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4e">
<title>Efficiency depends on eye type and photoreceptor energy cost</title>
<p>In both apposition and simple eye models, efficiency decreases with increasing <italic>C</italic><sub><italic>tot</italic></sub> (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8b</xref>), making a bit of information more expensive in a larger eye. The decline in efficiency with increasing eye size is steeper in apposition models, as expected from the well-known scaling relationships enforced by lens diffraction and eye g<underline>eo</underline>metry, spatial resolution increases as eye radius, <italic>R</italic>, in a simple eye and as <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="576511v2_inline2.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> in an apposition eye (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Kirschfeld, 1976</xref>). However, using <italic>R</italic> as a measure of investment fails to identify the contribution of the photoreceptor array and fails to account for the fact that an apposition eye is not a solid sphere. When our more realistic measure of cost, specific volume, is used a <italic>Drosophila</italic> size apposition eye is 10 times less efficient than a simple eye of the same cost and a dragonfly size eye is 100 times less efficient (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8b</xref>). In both simple and apposition eyes efficiency is reduced by increasing the photoreceptor energy tariff <italic>K</italic><sub><italic>E</italic></sub>. This effect is much greater in simple eyes (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8b</xref>) thus, as also found for the reduction of photoreceptor length (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7b</xref>), <italic>K</italic><sub><italic>E</italic></sub> has more impact on the design of simple eyes.</p>

<title>Expanding our understanding of apposition eye design</title>
<p>We build on theoretical studies that show how constraints imposed by apposition optics, eye geometry and eye size determine spatial resolution and information capacity when eye radius <italic>R</italic>, and hence corneal area, represent the limiting resource (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Howard &amp; Snyder, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Kirschfeld, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Snyder et al., 1977</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Howard &amp; Snyder (1983)</xref> introduced the physiological constraint, transduction unit saturation, and showed that it increases the optimum value of eye parameter, <italic>p</italic>, in bright light by placing a fixed ceiling on <italic>SNR</italic><sub><italic>ph</italic></sub> that is equivalent to operating at a lower light level. We extend Howard and Snyder’s (1983) approach by using a measure of cost, specific volume, that allows eye radius <italic>R</italic> to vary while total cost remains constant. This added realism allows us to raise and lower the <italic>SNR</italic> ceiling imposed by transduction units by trading investments in rhabdomere length against investments in dioptric apparatus. In so doing we discover that it is advantageous for photoreceptors to lengthen rhabdomeres so as to reduce shot noise. Indeed, in daylight <italic>Calliphora vicina</italic> R1-6 achieve the lowest level of photoreceptor noise reported to date, an equivalent contrast of 0.0084 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Anderson &amp; Laughlin, 2000</xref>). This extreme specialisation resembles Autrum’s proposition that apposition eye photoreceptors compensate for poor spatial resolution by increasing temporal resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Autrum, 1958</xref>), thereby achieving the highest flicker fusion frequencies known, in excess of 400 Hz (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">Tatler et al., 2000</xref>). Perhaps enhancing photoreceptor performance to compensate for optical inefficiency is a principle of apposition eye design?</p>
<p>Increasing temporal resolution increases photoreceptor energy consumption, so to improve efficiency apposition eye photoreceptors match temporal bandwidth to the properties of the images they form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Laughlin &amp; Weckström, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Niven et al., 2007</xref>). Eye regions that have lower spatial resolution and encounter more slowly moving images save energy by reducing photoreceptor bandwidth (B. G. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Burton et al., 2001</xref>). Although this matching makes large energy savings it is not included in our models because, to reduce the burden of establishing proof of principle, we fix photoreceptor bandwidth at the high value measured in a fully light-adapted blowfly. Nonetheless, our models can accommodate the costs and benefits of changing temporal bandwidth because they operate in the frequency domain (Methods). Boosting temporal resolution will be more cost-effective in large apposition eyes because photoreceptor energy costs are marginalised by costs associated with array volume (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4e,f</xref>), therefore investments of energy that increase temporal band-width are increasing the return on the much larger investment in array volume (e.g. carriage cost). Some fast flying diurnal insects with large facet lenses reduce the carriage cost of the photoreceptor array by surrounding each ommatidium with a palisade of air-filled tracheae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Horridge, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Laughlin &amp; McGinness, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Smith &amp; Butler, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c102">Wardill et al., 2017</xref>). The volumes and savings involved can be large. Published micrographs of dragonfly dorsal eye (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Horridge, 1969</xref>) suggest that air fills at least 50% of array cross section.</p>

<title>How efficiently do insects allocate resources within their apposition eyes?</title>
<p>In principle one can establish the efficiency of an insect’s investments in optics and photoreceptors by computing the performance surface for a model eye region that has the same parameters as the insect’s eye region, then observing how closely the insect’s eye region approaches the optimum configuration. We cannot do this at present because a critical parameter, the photoreceptor energy tariff <italic>K</italic><sub><italic>E</italic></sub>, has not been determined: the best we can do is use data from blowflies to estimate <italic>K</italic><sub><italic>E</italic></sub>’s likely range (Methods). Not knowing <italic>K</italic><sub><italic>E</italic></sub> is a major impediment to obtaining exact fits of our models to data because our modelling has discovered that the morphology of an efficient eye is sensitive to photoreceptor energy costs: in apposition eyes, increasing <italic>K</italic><sub><italic>E</italic></sub> across its likely range reduces the depth of the photoreceptor array by as much as 90% (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4c</xref>). Nor can we use our models to infer <italic>K</italic><sub><italic>E</italic></sub> by adjusting it to fit the data. Changing <italic>K</italic><sub><italic>E</italic></sub> has very little effect on <italic>D</italic> and <italic>Δϕ</italic>, therefore we must fit the model to <italic>L</italic>, and this requires several data points from eyes of the same species because <italic>K</italic><sub><italic>E</italic></sub> will be species specific (Methods). In our most consistent data set, the NS eyes (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>; <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>), it is impossible to obtain a satisfactory fit: the 12 data points come from 7 species and there are never more than 2 points per species. There are several data points per species for fused rhabdom apposition eyes (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>; <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>), but in each of the four species the data points are too widely scattered to obtain a useful fit. This scatter in values of <italic>L</italic> is not surprising. Our generic fused rhabdom model glosses over the large differences in F-number and rhabdom diameter seen within the eye of each species (<xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>), and these differences probably reflect the specialisation of eye regions for different purposes, e.g. in the fovea the detection, tracking and interception of mates and prey, and in the periphery the monitoring of optic flow and the detection of potential prey and predators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Labhart &amp; Nilsson, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Menzel et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">Straw et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c98">van Hateren et al., 1989</xref>). This proposition is supported by the observation that the empirical data for <italic>D</italic> and <italic>Δϕ</italic> (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6a,b</xref>) are also more widely scattered than the data for the more homogeneous group, fly NS eyes (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5a,b</xref>). Because our method calculates three basic determinants of the quality of the captured image, <italic>Δϕ, Δρ</italic> and <italic>SNR</italic><sub><italic>ph</italic></sub>, it can be adapted to compute performance surfaces for these specialised tasks, however the necessary theory has not been developed.</p>
<p>Having raised the question, efficient for what, we must examine our assumption that every eye region of a diurnal insect is adapted for vision in full daylight. The fact that insects in our data sets have larger lenses, interommatidial angles and eye parameters than our models predict (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>) suggests that their eye regions are adapted for lower light levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Snyder, 1979</xref>). We can think of two mutually inclusive reasons why a diurnal eye will not be adapted for vision in full daylight. The eye might be adapted for the time of day when the behaviour it supports is most profitable, e.g. insects that are most active early and/or late in the day to avoid predators and desiccation, and insects that prey on these crepuscular insects. Second, because an eye’s performance surface is flat-topped, an eye region optimized for an intermediate light intensity might, when averaged over the daylight hours, perform better than an eye adapted for bright light. Our models can be developed to investigate how costs and benefits influence the design of eyes adapted for lower light levels (see below), and modified to investigate two further reasons for increasing the eye parameter <italic>p</italic>, higher image speeds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Snyder, 1979</xref>) and increasing <italic>D</italic> in “bright zones” to improve the detection of small targets and small movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">Straw et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c98">van Hateren et al., 1989</xref>)</p>
<p>In summary, for want of both data and theory, we are currently unable to quantify the efficiency with which an apposition eye region performs the function for which it is adapted. Nonetheless, we have two reasons to conclude that flying diurnal insects allocate resources to the optics and photoreceptor arrays of their apposition eyes efficiently. First, the empirical values we extract from published data lie within or close to the boundaries defined by our theoretical curves for eyes that maximise a general-purpose measure of performance, information capacity (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5</xref>,<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). Second, the flat-topped performance surfaces have extensive high-efficiency zones within which an eye’s morphology can be changed while retaining &gt;95% of the maximum information capacity (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). Thus eyes that are not optimised to maximise information capacity can still be gathering information with high efficiency. This observation speaks to the value of deriving performance surfaces: one can consider competing demands, evaluate loss of function and identify compromises.</p>

<title>Efficient resource allocation is a general principle</title>
<p>Efficient resource allocation is observed at many levels of biological organization, from single molecules to life histories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Bigman &amp; Levy, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Garland et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Nijhout &amp; Emlen, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">Stearns, 1989</xref>). Eyes are no exception. In an apposition eye, optical radius, <italic>R</italic>, represents corneal surface area per unit solid angle, therefore models that maximise spatial acuity or information capacity at constant <italic>R</italic> show that corneal area can be allocated to facet lenses to maximise spatial acuity and information capacity by trading spatial resolution for <italic>SNR</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Snyder, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Snyder et al., 1977</xref>). In the POL region of fly NS eye a fixed resource, the number of microvilli in the central rhabdom, is allocated to a pair of photoreceptors, R7 and R8, to increase the efficiency of polarisation coding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Heras &amp; Laughlin, 2017</xref>), and in primate eye retinal area is allocated to cone spectral types to increase coding efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Garrigan et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c110">Zhang et al., 2022</xref>).</p>
<p>Matching the sampling density of the photoreceptor array to lens resolving power (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Nilsson &amp; Land, 2012</xref>) also allocates the resources invested in photoreceptors more efficiently by avoiding wasteful overcapacity, according to the principle of symmorphosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Piersma &amp; van Gils, 2011</xref>; C. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c92">Taylor &amp; Weibel, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c104">Weibel, 2000</xref>). However, unlike the matching of <italic>L</italic> to <italic>Δϕ</italic> that allocates resources efficiently to optics and photoreceptors, the matching of capacities does not consider the individual cost-benefit functions of a system’s components. When these are taken into account, the allocation of investment that maximises efficiency can instal over-capacity in components with more favourable cost-benefit ratios, as demonstrated for bones in racehorse forelegs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Alexander, 1997</xref>) and chains of signalling molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Schreiber et al., 2002</xref>).</p>

<title>Understanding the adaptive radiation of eyes</title>
<p>The method we introduce here can be developed to view several aspects of eye adaptation and evolution through a cost-benefit lens because it is flexible. Our approach is not wedded to information capacity: it supports other measures of visual performance because it relates investments to fundamental determinants of image quality. Moreover, the method can be applied to several trade-offs that influence eye design by relaxing the simplifying assumptions we make here. To give a concrete example, the trade-offs between acuity and sensitivity that adapt eyes for nocturnal or diurnal vision can be viewed through a cost-benefit lens by allowing F-number and rhabdom(ere) diameter to vary, and by adopting a method that calculates the mean and variance of photon transduction rate on <italic>N</italic><sub><italic>vil</italic></sub> in rhabdomeres of any given length and variable cross section, at any biologically plausible light intensity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Heras &amp; Laughlin, 2017</xref>).</p>
<p>One can also relax the restrictions we place on eye geometry. Our approach does not depend on spherical geometry, it depends on being able to relate the shapes, sizes and constituents of an eye’s components to their costs and performance. Advances in scanning, imaging and digital reconstruction offer opportunities to determine shapes, volumes and constituents directly, and advances in modelling optical and physiological processes are extending our ability to relate these properties to performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Kim, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Song et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">Sumner-Rooney et al., 2019</xref>; G. J. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c94">Taylor et al., 2019</xref>). These powerful new methods can take us closer to the goal of understanding of how costs, benefits and innovative mechanisms drive eye evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">Sumner-Rooney, 2018</xref>), and our flexible cost-benefit approach can support this endeavour.</p>
<p>Our approach also identifies factors that contribute to selective pressure, and gauges their effects. For example, the pressure to reduce photoreceptor energy cost depends on a photoreceptor’s impact on an animal’s energy budget. This effect is captured by our photoreceptor energy tariff, <italic>K</italic><sub><italic>E</italic></sub>, because it relates a photoreceptor’s energy consumption to the animal’s metabolic rate (Methods). We also find that photoreceptor energy costs are marginalised when apposition eye size increases and this encourages the use of wide bandwidth, high <italic>SNR</italic> photoreceptors with high metabolic rates. Most interestingly, the derivation of performance surfaces (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>) reveals a large area, the robust high-performance zone within which an eye’s morphology can be adapted to a particular task while retaining more than 95% of a measure of general-purpose capability, information capacity. This low “loss of opportunity” cost helps to explain the remarkable degree of fine tuning observed in apposition compound eyes (B. G. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Burton et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Land, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Nilsson &amp; Land, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">Sumner-Rooney et al., 2019</xref>; G. J. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c94">Taylor et al., 2019</xref>), in line with suggestions that robustness increases evolvability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Drack &amp; Betz, 2022</xref>).</p>
<p>Two key steps in the early evolution of eyes were the stacking of photoreceptive membranes to absorb more photons, and the formation of optics to intercept more photons and concentrate them according to angle of incidence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Nilsson, 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">2021</xref>). Our modelling of well-developed image forming eyes shows that to improve performance stacked membranes (rhabdomeres) compete with optics for the resources invested in an eye, and this competition profoundly influences both form and function. Thus it is likely that competition between optics and photoreceptors was shaping eyes as lenses evolved to support low resolution spatial vision. If so, the developmental mechanisms that allocate resources within extant high resolution eyes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Casares &amp; McGregor, 2021</xref>), by controlling cell size and shape and, as our study emphasises, setting up gradients of shape and size across the eye, will have analogues or homologues in ancient eyes. Their discovery will not only tell us how Nature constructs perfectly contrived instruments, it will illuminate the evolutionary pathway to perfection.</p>

<title>Calculating a photoreceptor array’s information rate</title>
<p>Our calculations of the rate at which an eye’s photoreceptor array codes achromatic information, in bits per steradian per second, take account of five factors. 1) The statistics of the signals presented to an eye under natural conditions; 2) the blurring of the spatial image by the eye’s dioptric apparatus; 3) the sampling of the spatial image by the photoreceptor array; 4) the introduction of noise by the stochastic activation of a finite population of transduction units and 5) the temporal smoothing of signals and noise during phototransduction. We calculate information rates in the frequency domain using methods developed for apposition eyes (de Ruyter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">van Steveninck &amp; Laughlin, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Howard &amp; Snyder, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Snyder et al., 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c97">van Hateren, 1992</xref>).</p>

<title>Natural intensity signals</title>
<p>We calculate the spatial and temporal power spectra of naturalistic signals using the model established for blowfly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c97">van Hateren, 1992</xref>). An eye images an ensemble of natural scenes in which power decreases as the square of spatial frequency, as measured and predicted theoretically (G.

<graphic xlink:href="576511v2_eqn12.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
The proportionality constant <italic>c</italic><sub><italic>c</italic></sub> is chosen to set the total contrast of the image formed by the eye (defined as the square root of the ratio between the power of the signal and the square of the mean level of signal) to an appropriate value. This contrast depends on the eye that observes the scene. For images spatially filtered by a blowfly compound eye the average contrast, calculated locally over intervals of 25-50 degrees, is 0.4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Laughlin, 1981</xref>). Accordingly we use a proportionality constant that scales the power of frequencies between one cycle per 50 degrees and the upper cut-off frequency dictated by sampling, one cycle per 1.5 degrees, to be (0.4)<sup>2</sup> = 0.16.</p>
<p>To add the temporal dimension <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c97">van Hateren (1992)</xref> modelled how the movement of an eye through an ensemble of uniformly distributed objects generates temporal structure.

Local movements produced by objects moving within a scene, although acknowledged to be biologically significant, have little impact on the statistics of the signal encountered by an eye moving in a straight line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c97">van Hateren, 1992</xref>).</p>
<p>Distributions of this form peak at lower speeds and have a long tail that extends to speeds faster than <italic>σ</italic><sub><italic>v</italic></sub>.

<title>Aliasing</title>
<p>When the image projected to the photoreceptor array contains spatial frequencies that are beyond the spatial resolving power of the array, these are aliased to lower frequencies, thereby distorting the sampled image (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Snyder et al., 1994</xref>). We assume that all aliased spatial frequencies act as noise, shared equally between the correctly sampled spatial frequencies:

<title>Calculating Information</title>
<p>We calculate the spatial information gathered by the photoreceptor array by modifying the formula for a square spatial sampling lattice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Howard &amp; Snyder, 1983</xref>). For a hexagonal array, the equation for spatial information has the form

where the array cut-off frequency is<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="576511v2_inline8.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>.

where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="576511v2_inline9.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> is the number of discriminable levels of contrast coded by each ommatidium.

<title>Energy consumed per microvillus</title>
<p>Our estimates are based on high resolution measurements of the oxygen consumed by isolated <italic>Calliphora vicina</italic> compound eyes, made using a magnetic diver balance (Pangršič et al., 2005). In bright light, an eye consumes 1.8 <italic>×</italic> 10<sup>−9</sup> litres of oxygen per second which, converting to the units commonly used to express metabolic rates, is 6.48 mm<sup>3</sup> of oxygen per hour. With 5000 ommatidia, 60,000 microvilli in the rhabdomere of a photoreceptor R1-6, and taking the central rhabdom formed by R7 and R7 to be equivalent to a single R1-6, the eye contains 2 <italic>×</italic> 10<sup>9</sup> microvilli, giving an oxygen consumption per microvillus in bright light <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="576511v2_inline12.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> oxygen per microvillus per hour. In darkness the eye’s oxygen consumption drops to one third, giving <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="576511v2_inline13.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> oxygen per microvillus per hour.</p>
<p>Because these estimates are based on measurements from whole eyes they include consumption by all cell types. There are three reasons why photoreceptors dominate total consumption. First, the values of an eye’s oxygen consumption in light and in darkness are close to the total photoreceptor consumption predicted from electrophysiological estimates of the ATP consumed by single photoreceptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Laughlin et al., 1998</xref>; Pangršič et al., 2005). Second, photoreceptors are the compound eye’s most active cells because transducing photons at high light intensities necessarily requires large fluxes of ions and chemical intermediates. Third, to support their activity photoreceptors contain most of a compound eye’s mitochondria.</p>

<p>To convert the energy consumption of the eye per microvillus into an equivalent volume we should ideally use the animal’s average specific metabolic rate, measured under natural conditions, but to the best of our knowledge this field metabolic rate has not been measured in blowflies. Therefore, we combine a value of the specific metabolic rate in continuous flight that is towards the high end of the range measured in <italic>Calliphora, sFMR</italic> = 30 mm<sup>3</sup> oxygen per mg per hour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c108">Yurkiewicz &amp; Smyth, 1966</xref>), with the resting metabolic rate measured in the blowfly <italic>Phormia, RMR</italic> = 2.6 mm<sup>3</sup> oxygen per mg per hour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Keister &amp; Buck, 1961</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Niven &amp; Scharlemann, 2005</xref>), according the number of hours per day spent flying, <italic>T</italic><sub><italic>F</italic></sub> , to estimate the daily average specific metabolic rate

<title>Preliminary model of a simple eye</title>
<p>Our generic simple eye model has the same F-number <italic>F</italic> = 2 as our generic fly NS model, and its rhabdom diameter equals the rhabdomere diameter in in fly <italic>d</italic><sub><italic>rh</italic></sub> = 1.9 µm. The simple eye is hemispherical (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7a</xref>), therefore the specific volume of optics is given by
<disp-formula id="eqn45">
<graphic xlink:href="576511v2_eqn45.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
and with a photoreceptor array with rhabdoms of length <italic>L</italic>, the total specific volume of the eye is given by
<disp-formula id="eqn46">
<graphic xlink:href="576511v2_eqn46.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
and the specific volume of the photoreceptor array by

<graphic xlink:href="576511v2_eqn47.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
The receptor spacing, <italic>Δϕ</italic>, depends on the lens focal length, <italic>f</italic> and <italic>d</italic><sub><italic>rh</italic></sub>,
<disp-formula id="eqn48">
<graphic xlink:href="576511v2_eqn48.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
This is an important difference between simple eyes and apposition eyes. In apposition eyes model <italic>Δϕ</italic> is can be varied at constant <italic>f</italic> and <italic>D</italic> by changing the optical radius <italic>R</italic>. However, in a simple eye with a diffraction limited lens the relationship between the optical resolving power of the lens and the anatomical resolving power of the photoreceptor mosaic depends on F-number, <italic>F</italic> , as follows (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Snyder, 1979</xref>). For a hexagonal mosaic of photoreceptors the diffraction limit is reached when
<disp-formula id="eqn49">
<graphic xlink:href="576511v2_eqn49.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
When <italic>λ</italic>, the wavelength of light is 500 nm, and <italic>d</italic><sub><italic>rh</italic></sub> = 2 µm, then <italic>F</italic> = 6.9. It follows that our model simple eye with <italic>F</italic> = 2 is undersampling by a factor of approximately 3.5. Running our simple eye model with <italic>F</italic> = 4 had very little effect on the optimum <italic>L</italic> (data not shown), suggesting that our conclusion that efficient simple eyes have much shorter rhabdoms than efficient apposition eyes is robust with respect to undersampling.</p>

<title>Calculating <italic>N</italic><sub><italic>vil</italic></sub> as a function of <italic>L</italic></title>
<p>We estimate <italic>v</italic>, the number of microvilli per unit length of rhabdomere, for our NS eye model using findings from photorevceptors R1-6 in female blowflies. Dividing the number of microvilli in a rhabdomere, 6 <italic>×</italic> 10<sup>4</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Howard et al., 1987</xref>), by <italic>L</italic> = 260 µm, which is towards the upper end of the range <italic>L</italic> = 220 µm - 280 µm reported for blowfly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Hardie, 1985</xref>), gives <italic>v</italic> = 230 µm<sup>−1</sup>. Although fly rhabdomeres vary in both diameter and degree of taper according to eye region, sex and species, and this sculpting adapts photoreceptor arrays to visual ecology, e.g.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Gonzalez-Bellido et al., 2011</xref>), we fix <italic>v</italic> to simplify the derivation of points of principle.</p>
<p>For our generic model of a fused rhabdom apposition eye we consider a column of six photoreceptors that, like the short visual fibres R1-6 in fly, terminate in the first optic neuropile. Their six rhabdomeres form the triradiate rhabdom described in locust (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c105">Wilson et al., 1978</xref>). This fused rhabdom has a cross-section that approximates an equilateral triangle in which each side is constructed by a pair photoreceptors whose parallel microvilli are equivalent to a single fly R1-6 rhabdomere. Thus each pixel is coded by a set of six rhabdomeres that are equivalent to three fly R1-6 rhabdomeres. Therefore, the number of transduction units coding a pixel is half that in fly and the resulting changes in signal and noise are simply accounted for by replacing the factor <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="576511v2_inline14.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn29">Equation 29</xref> with<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="576511v2_inline15.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>, and 3<italic>ψ</italic> in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn33">Equations 33</xref> and <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn34">34</xref> with <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="576511v2_inline16.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>.</p>
<p>For our generic model of a diurnal simple eye we assume that, as in spiders, the rhabdomeres of adjacent photoreceptors abut; i.e. there are no gaps between photoreceptors, therefore a photoreceptor’s rhabdomeres project from a central column of cytoplasm. To compare with our apposition models we assume that the diameter of the photoreceptor entrance aperture, <italic>d</italic><sub><italic>rh</italic></sub> = 1.9 µm and contains microvilli projecting in three directions. In this case, the simple eye photoreceptor is equivalent to the triradiate fused rhabdom.</p>

<p>This paper makes a <bold>valuable</bold> contribution to our understanding of the tradeoffs in eye design - specifically between improvements in optics and in photoreceptor performance. The authors successfully build a formal theory that enables comparisons across a wide range of species and eye types. One notable example is that how space should be allocated to optics and photoreceptors depends on eye type - with particularly notable differences between compound and simple eyes. The framework introduced to compare different design properties is <bold>convincing</bold> and provides a nice example of how to study tradeoffs in seemingly disparate design properties.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Two important factors in visual performance are the resolving power of the lens and the signal-to-noise ratio of the photoreceptors. These both compete for space: a larger lens has improved resolving power over a smaller one, and longer photoreceptors capture more photons and hence generate responses with lower noise. The current paper explores the tradeoff of these two factors, asking how space should be allocated to maximize eye performance (measured as encoded information).</p>
<p>The revisions, to my read, have greatly improved the paper. Most of this was due to setting clear expectations from the start of the paper. Nice work!</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In short, the paper presents a theoretical framework that predicts how resources should be optimally distributed between receptors and optics in eyes.</p>
<p>After revision of an already excellent contribution, the manuscript is now even better. The authors have responded carefully to all reviewer comments.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors build on the principle of resource allocation within an organism and develop a formal theory for optimal distribution of resources within an eye between the receptor array and the optics. Because the two parts of eyes, receptor arrays and optics, share the same role of providing visual information to the animal it is possible to isolate these from resource allocation in the rest of the animal. This allows for a novel and powerful way of exploring the principles that govern eye design. By clever and thoughtful assumptions/constraints, the authors have built a formal theory of resource allocation between the receptor array and the optics for two major types of compound eye as well as for camera-type eyes. The theory is formalized with variables that are well characterized in a number of different animal eyes, resulting in testable predictions.</p>
<p>The authors use the theory to explain a number of design features that depend on different optimal distribution of resources between the receptor array and the optics in different types of eye. As an example, they successfully explain why eye regions with different spatial resolution should be built in different ways. They also explain differences between different types of eye, such as long photoreceptors in apposition compound eyes and much shorter receptors in camera type eyes. The predictive power in the theory is impressive.</p>
<p>To keep the number of parameters at a minimum, the theory was developed for two types of compound eye (neural superposition, and apposition) and for camera-type eyes. It is possible to extend the theory to other types of eye, although it would likely require more variables and assumptions/constraints to the theory. It is thus good to introduce the conceptual ideas without overdoing the applications of the theory.</p>
<p>The paper extends a previous theory, developed by the senior author, that develops performance surfaces for optimal cost/benefit design of eyes. By combining this with resource allocation between receptors and optics, the theoretical understanding of eye design takes a major leap and provides entirely new sets of predictions and explanations for why eyes are built the way they are.</p>
<p>The paper is well written and even though the theory development in the Results may be difficult to take in for many biologists, the Discussion very nicely lists all the major predictions under separate headings, and here the text is more tuned for readers that are not entirely comfortable with the formalism of the Results section. I must point out though that the Results section is kept exemplary concise. The figures are excellent and help explain concepts that otherwise may go above the head of many biologists.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This is a proposal for a new theory for the geometry of insect eyes. The novel cost-benefit function combines the cost of the optical portion with the photoreceptor portion of the eye. These quantities are put on the same footing using a specific (normalized) volume measure, plus an energy factor for the photoreceptor compartment. An optimal information transmission rate then specifies each parameter and resource allocation ratio for a variable total cost. The elegant treatment allows for comparison across a wide range of species and eye types. Simple eyes are found to be several times more efficient across a range of eye parameters than neural superposition eyes. Some trends in eye parameters can be explained by optimal allocation of resources between the optics and photoreceptors compartments of the eye.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Data from a variety of species roughly align with rough trends in the cost analysis, e.g. as a function of expanding the length of the photoreceptor compartment.</p>
<p>New data could be added to the framework once collected, and many species can be compared.</p>
<p>Eyes of different shapes are compared.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Detailed quantitative conclusions are not possible given the approximations and simplifying assumptions in the models and weak accounting for trends in the data across eye types.</p>
<p>Comments on revisions:</p>
<p>I have no additional comments for the authors and appreciate the revisions and corrections implemented - I think those changes have improved the clarity of the manuscript and expanded the potential readership for the paper.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the previous reviews.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Two important factors in visual performance are the resolving power of the lens and the signal-to-noise ratio of the photoreceptors. These both compete for space: a larger lens has improved resolving power over a smaller one, and longer photoreceptors capture more photons and hence generate responses with lower noise. The current paper explores the tradeoff of these two factors, asking how space should be allocated to maximize eye performance (measured as encoded information).</p>
<p>Your summary is clear, concise and elegant. The competition is not just for space, it is for space, materials and energy. We  now emphasise that we are considering these three costs in our rewrites of the Abstract and the first paragraph of the Discussion.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The topic of the paper is interesting and not well studied. The approach is clearly described and seems appropriate (with a few exceptions - see weaknesses below). In most cases, the parameter space of the models are well explored and tradeoffs are clear.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Light level</p>
<p>The calculations in the paper assume high light levels (which reduces the number of parameters that need to be considered). The impact of this assumption is not clear. A concern is that the optimization may be quite different at lower light levels. Such a dependence on light level could explain why the model predictions and experiment are not in particularly good agreement. The paper would benefit from exploring this issue.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for raising this point. We briefly explained in our original Discussion, under Understanding the adaptive radiation of eyes (Version 1, Iines 756 – 762), how our method can be modified to investigate eyes adapted for lower light levels. We have some thoughts on how eyes might be adapted. In general, transduction rates are increased by increasing <italic>D</italic>, reducing <italic>f</italic>, increasing <italic>drh</italic> and increasing <italic>L</italic>. In addition_, ∆φ_ is increased to allow for a larger <italic>D</italic> within the constraint of eye radius/corneal surface area, and to avoid wasteful oversampling (the changes in <italic>D, f</italic> and <italic>drh</italic> increase acceptance angle ∆<italic>ρ</italic>). We suspect that in eyes optimised for the efficient use of space, materials and energy the increases in <italic>L</italic> will be relatively small, first because  increasing <italic>D</italic>, reducing <italic>f</italic> and increasing <italic>drh</italic> are much more effective at increasing transduction rate than increasing <italic>L</italic>. Second, increasing sensitivity by reducing <italic>f</italic> decreases the cost <italic>Vo</italic> whereas increasing sensitivity by increasing <italic>L</italic> increases the cost <italic>Vph</italic>. This disadvantage, together with exponential absorption, might explain why <italic>L</italic> is only 10% - 20% longer in the apposition eyes of nocturnal bees (Somanathan et al, J. comp. Physiol. A195, 571583, 2009). Because this line of argument is speculative and enters new territory, we have not included it in our revised version. We already present a lot of new material for readers to digest, and we agree with referee 2 that “<italic>It is possible to extend the theory to other types of eyes, although it would likely require more variables and assumptions/constraints to the theory. It is thus good to introduce the conceptual ideas without overdoing the applications of the theory”</italic>. Nonetheless, we take your point that some of the eyes in our data set might be adapted for lower light levels, and we have rewritten the Discussion section, How efficiently do insects allocate resources within their apposition eyes accordingly. On line 827 – 843 we address the assumption that eyes are adapted for full daylight,  and also take the opportunity  to mention two more reasons for increasing the eye parameter <italic>p</italic>: namely increasing image velocity (Snyder, 1979), and constructing  bright zones that increase the detectability of small targets (van Hateren et al., 1989; Straw et al., 2006).</p>

<p>Discrepancies between predictions and experiment</p>
<p>As the authors clearly describe, experimental measurements of eye parameters differ systematically from those predicted. This makes it difficult to know what to take away from the paper. The qualitative arguments about how resources should be allocated are pretty general, and the full model seems a complex way to arrive at those arguments. Could this reflect a failure of one of the assumptions that the model rests on - e.g. high light levels, or that the cost of space for photoreceptors and optics is similar? Given these discrepancies between model and experiment, it is also hard to evaluate conclusions about the competition between optics and photoreceptors (e.g. at the end of the abstract) and about the importance for evolution (end of introduction).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Your misgivings boil down to two issues: what use is a model that fails to fit the data, and do we need a complicated model to show something that seems to be intuitively obvious?  Our study is useful because it introduces new approaches, methods, factors and explanations which advance our analysis and understanding of eye design and evolution. Your comments make it clear that we failed to get this message across and we have revised the manuscript accordingly. We have rewritten the Abstract and the first paragraph of the Discussion to emphasise the value of our new measure of cost, specific volume, by including more of its practical advantages. In particular, our use of specific volume 1) opens the door to the morphospace of all eyes of given type and cost. 2) This allows one to construct performance surfaces across morphospace that not only identify optima, but by evaluating the sub-optimal cast light on efficiency and adaptability. 3) Shows that photoreceptor energy costs have a major impact on design and efficiency, and 4) allows us to calculate and compare the capacities and efficiencies of compound eyes and simple eyes using a superior measure of cost. It is also possible that your dissatisfaction was deepened by disappointment. The first sentence of our original Abstract said that the goal of design is to maximize performance, so you might have expected to see that eyes are optimised.  Given that optimization provides cast iron proof that a system is designed to be efficient, and previous studies of coding by fly LMCs (Laughlin, 1981; Srinivasan et al., 1982 &amp; van Hateren 1992) validated Barlow’s Efficient Coding Hypothesis by showing that coding is optimised, your expectation is reasonable. However, our investigation of how the allocation of resources to optics and photoreceptors affects an eye’s performance, efficiency and design does not depend <italic>a priori</italic>  on finding optima, therefore we have removed the “maximized”. Our revised Abstract now says, “to improve performance”.</p>
<p>In short, our study illustrates an old adage in statistics “<italic>All models fail to fit, but some are useful</italic>”. As is often the case, the way in which our model fails is useful. In the original version of the Results and Discussion, we argued that the allocation of resources is efficient, and identified factors that can, in principle, explain the scattering of data points. Indeed, our modelling identifies two of these deficiencies; a lack of data on species-specific energy usage, and the need for models that quantify the relationship between the quality of the captured image and the behavioural tasks for which an eye might be specialised. Thus, by examining the model’s failings we identify critical factors and pose new questions for future research.  We have rewritten the Discussion section How efficiently do insects allocate resources<bold>….</bold> to make these points. We hope that these revisions will convince you that we have established a starting point for definitive studies, invented a vehicle that has travelled far enough to discover new territory, and shown that it can be modified to cope with difficult terrain.</p>
<p>Turning to the need for a complicated model, because the costs and benefits depend on elementary optics and geometry, we too thought that there ought to be a simple model. However, when we tried to formulate a simple set of equations that approximate the definitive findings of our more complicated model we discovered that this is not as straightforward as we thought.  Many of the parameters in our model interact to determine costs and benefits, and many of these interactions are non-linear (e.g. the volumes of shells in spheres involve quadratic and cubic terms, and information depends on the log of a square root). So, rather than hold back publication of our complicated model, we decided to explain how it works as clearly as we can and demonstrate its value.</p>
<p>In response to your final comment, <italic>“it is hard to evaluate conclusions about the competition between optics and photoreceptors (e.g. at the end of the abstract) and about the importance for evolution (end of introduction)”</italic>, we stand by our original argument. There must be competition in an eye of fixed cost, and because competition favours a heavy investment in photoreceptors, both in theory and in practice, it  is a significant factor in eye design. A match between investments in optics and photoreceptors is predicted by theory and observed in fly NS eyes, therefore this is a design principle. As for evolution, no one would deny that it is important to view the adaptive radiation of eyes through a cost-benefit lens. Our lens is the first to view the whole eye, optics and photoreceptor array, and the first to treat the costs of space, materials and energy. Although the view through our lens is a bit fuzzy, it reveals that costs, benefits and trade-offs are important. Thus we have established a promising starting point for a new and more comprehensive cost-benefit approach to understanding eye design and evolution.  As for the involvement of genes, when there are heritable changes in phenotype genes must be involved and if, as we suggest, efficient resource allocation is beneficial, the developmental mechanisms responsible for allocating resources to optics and photoreceptor array will be playing a formative role in eye evolution.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In short, the paper presents a theoretical framework that predicts how resources should be optimally distributed between receptors and optics in eyes.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors build on the principle of resource allocation within an organism and develop a formal theory for optimal distribution of resources within an eye between the receptor array and the optics. Because the two parts of eyes, receptor arrays and optics, share the same role of providing visual information to the animal it is possible to isolate these from resource allocation in the rest of the animal. This allows for a novel and powerful way of exploring the principles that govern eye design. By clever and thoughtful assumptions/constraints, the authors have built a formal theory of resource allocation between the receptor array and the optics for two major types of compound eye as well as for camera-type eyes. The theory is formalized with variables that are well characterized in a number of different animal eyes, resulting in testable predictions.</p>
<p>The authors use the theory to explain a number of design features that depend on different optimal distribution of resources between the receptor array and the optics in different types of eyes. As an example, they successfully explain why eye regions with different spatial resolution should be built in different ways. They also explain differences between different types of eyes, such as long photoreceptors in apposition compound eyes and much shorter receptors in camera type eyes. The predictive power in the theory is impressive.</p>
<p>To keep the number of parameters at a minimum, the theory was developed for two types of compound eye (neural superposition, and apposition) and for camera-type eyes. It is possible to extend the theory to other types of eyes, although it would likely require more variables and assumptions/constraints to the theory. It is thus good to introduce the conceptual ideas without overdoing the applications of the theory.</p>
<p>The paper extends a previous theory, developed by the senior author, that develops performance surfaces for optimal cost/benefit design of eyes. By combining this with resource allocation between receptors and optics, the theoretical understanding of eye design takes a major leap and provides entirely new sets of predictions and explanations for why eyes are built the way they are.</p>
<p>The paper is well written and even though the theory development in the Results may be difficult to take in for many biologists, the Discussion very nicely lists all the major predictions under separate headings, and here the text is more tuned for readers that are not entirely comfortable with the formalism of the Results section. I must point out though that the Results section is kept exemplary concise. The figures are excellent and help explain concepts that otherwise may go above the head of many biologists.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This is a proposal for a new theory for the geometry of insect eyes. The novel costbenefit function combines the cost of the optical portion with the photoreceptor portion of the eye. These quantities are put on the same footing using a specific (normalized) volume measure, plus an energy factor for the photoreceptor compartment. An optimal information transmission rate then specifies each parameter and resource allocation ratio for a variable total cost. The elegant treatment allows for comparison across a wide range of species and eye types. Simple eyes are found to be several times more efficient across a range of eye parameters than neural superposition eyes. Some trends in eye parameters can be explained by optimal allocation of resources between the optics and photoreceptors compartments of the eye.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Data from a variety of species roughly align with rough trends in the cost analysis, e.g. as a function of expanding the length of the photoreceptor compartment.</p>
<p>New data could be added to the framework once collected, and many species can be compared.</p>
<p>Eyes of different shapes are compared.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Detailed quantitative conclusions are not possible given the approximations and simplifying assumptions in the models and poor accounting for trends in the data across eye types.</p>

<p>We think that you are referring to Figure 1. We modified the legend.</p>
<p>Lines 143-145: How does a different relative cost impact your results?</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Thank you for raising this question. Because our assumption that relative costs are the same is our starting point, and for optics it is not an obvious mistake, we do not raise your question here. We address your question where you next raise it because, for photoreceptors the assumption is obviously wrong.  We now emphasise that our method for accounting for photoreceptor energy costs can be applied to other costs.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Lines 187-190: Same as above - how do your results change if this assumption is not accurate?</p>
<p>We have revised our manuscript to emphasise that we are dealing with the situation in which our initial assumption (costs per unit volume are equal) breaks down. On (lines 203 - 208) we write <italic>“ However, this assumption breaks down when we consider specific metabolic rates. To enable and power phototransduction, photoreceptors have an exceptionally high specific metabolic rate (energy consumed per gram, and hence unit volume, per second) (Laughlin et al., 1998; Niven et al., 2007; Pangršič et al., 2005).

<p>We also revised part of the Discussion section<bold>,</bold> <bold>S</bold>pecific volume is a useful measure of cost to make it clear that we are able take account for situations in which the costs per unit volume are not equal, and we give our treatment of photoreceptor energy costs as an example of how this is done. On lines 626 - 640 we say</p>
<p><italic>Cost estimates can be adjusted for situations in which costs per unit volume are not equal, as illustratedby our treatment of photoreceptor energy consumption.  To support transduction the photoreceptor array has an exceptionally high metabolic rate (Laughlin et al., 1998; Niven et al., 2007; Pangršič et al., 2005). We account forthis higher energy cost by using the animal’s specific metabolic rate (power per unit mass and hence power per unit volume) to convert an array’s power consumption into an equivalent volume (Methods). Photoreceptor ion pumps are the major consumers of energy and the smaller contribution of pigmented glia (Coles, 1989) is included in our calculation of the energy tariff K<sub>E&lt;/sub_&gt;_</sub></italic>. (Methods). The higher costs of materials and their turnover in the photoreceptor array can be added the energy tariff KE but given the magnitude of the light-gated current (Laughlin et al., 1998) the relative increase will be very small. Thus for our intents and purposes the effects of these additional costs are covered by our models. For want of sufficient data……”.</p>

<p>(5) Maybe devote a short paragraph in the Discussion to other types of eye, such as optical superposition eyes and pinhole eyes. This could be done very shortly and without formalism.

</disp-quote>
<p>We do not discuss this because we have not found a full account of the trade-offs and their  effects on costs and benefits. We hope that our analysis of apposition and simple eyes will encourage people to analyse the relationships between costs and benefits in other eye types. To this end we pointed out in the Discussion that recent advances in imaging and modelling could be helpful.</p>

<p>(7)  I have some reservations about the text on lines 789-796. The problem is that optics can do very little to improve the performance of a directional photoreceptor where delrho should optimally be very wide. Here, membrane folding is the only efficient way to improve performance (SNR). The option to reduce delrho for better performance comes later when simultaneous spatial resolution (multiple pixels) is introduced.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Yes, we have been careless. We have rewritten this paragraph to say (lines 920-931)</p>
<p><italic>“Two key steps in the evolution of eyes were the stacking of photoreceptive membranes to absorb more photons, and the formation of optics to intercept more photons and concentrate them according to angle of incidence to form an image (Nilsson, 2013, 2021). Our modelling of well-developed image forming eyes shows that to improve performance stacked membranes (rhabdomeres) compete with optics for the resources invested in an eye, and this competition profoundly influences both form and function. It is likely that competition between optics and photoreceptors was shaping eyes as lenses evolved to support low resolution spatial vision. Thus the developmental mechanisms that allocate resources within modern high resolution eyes (Casares &amp; MacGregor, 2021), by controlling cell size and shape, and as our study emphasises, gradients in size and shape across an eye, will have analogues or homologues in more ancient eyes. Their discovery…. ”</italic> (lines 920-931</p>

<p>Suggestions for major revisions:</p>
<p>While the approach is novel and elegant, the results from the analysis of insect morphology do not broadly support the optimization argument and hardly constrain parameters, like the energy tariff value, at all. The most striking result of the paper is the flat plateau in information across a broad range of shape parameters and the length, and resolution trend in Figure 5.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>At no point in the Results and Discussion do we argue that resource allocation is optimized. Indeed, we frequently observe that it is not. Our mistake was to start the Abstract by observing that animals evolve to minimise costs. We have rewritten the Abstract accordingly.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The information peaks are quite shallow. This might actually be a very important and interesting result in the paper - the fact that the information plateaus could give the insect eye quite a wide range of parameters to slide between while achieving relatively efficient sensing of the environment. Instead of attempting to use a rather ad hoc and poorly supported measure of energetics in PR cost, perhaps the pitch could focus on this flexibility. <italic>K<sub>E</sub></italic> does not seem to constrain eye parameters and does not add much to the paper.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree, being able to construct performance surfaces across morphospace is an important advance in the field of eye design and evolution, and the performance surface’s flat top has interesting implications for the evolution of adaptations. Encouraged by your remarks, we have rewritten the Abstract and the introductory paragraph of the Discussion to draw attention to these points.</p>
<p>We are disappointed that we failed to convince you that our energy tariff, <italic>K<sub>E</sub></italic> , is no better than a poorly supported ad hoc parameter that does not add much to the paper. In our opinion a resource allocation model that ignores photoreceptor energy consumption is obviously inadequate because the high energy cost of phototransduction is both wellknown and considered to be a formative factor in eye evolution (Niven and Laughlin, 2008). One of the advantages of modelling is that one can assess the impact of factors that are known to be present, are thought to be important, but have not been quantified. We followed standard modelling practice by introducing a cost that has the same units as the other costs and, for good physiological reasons, increases linearly with the number of microvilli, according to <italic>K<sub>E</sub></italic>. We then vary this unknown cost parameter to discover when and why it is significant. We were pleased to discover that we could combine data on photoreceptor energy demands and whole animal metabolic rates to establish the likely range of <italic>K<sub>E</sub></italic>. This procedure enabled us to unify the cost-benefit analyses of optics and photoreceptors, and to discover that realistic values of <italic>K<sub>E</sub></italic> have a profound impact on the structure and performance of an efficient eye. We hope that this advance will encourage people to collect the data needed to evaluate <italic>K<sub>E</sub></italic></p>
<p>.   To emphasise the importance of <italic>K<sub>E</sub></italic> and dispel doubts associated with the failure of the model to fit the data, we have revised two sections:  Flies invest efficiently in costly photoreceptor arrays in the Results, and How efficiently do insects allocate resources within their apposition eyes?  in the Discussion. These rewrites also explain why it is impossible for us to infer <italic>K<sub>E</sub></italic> by adjusting its value so that the model’s predictions fit the data.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The graphics after Figure 3 are quite dense and hard to follow. None of the plateau extent shown in Fig 3 is carried through to the subsequent plots, which makes the conclusions drawn from these figures very hard to parse. If the peak information occurs on a flat plateau, it would be more helpful to see those ranges of parameters displayed in the figures.</p>
<p>Ideally one should do as you suggest and plot the extent of the plateau, but in our situation this is not very helpful. In the best data set, flies, optimised models predict D well, get close to ∆φ in larger eyes, and demonstrate that these optimum values are not very sensitive to <italic>K<sub>E</sub> L</italic> is a different matter, it is very sensitive to <italic>K<sub>E</sub> L</italic> which, as we show (and frequently remind) is poorly constrained by experimental data. The best we can do is estimate the envelope of <italic>L</italic> vs <italic>C<sub>tot</sub></italic>  curves, as defined by a plausible range of <italic>K<sub>E</sub>L</italic> . Because most of the plateau boundaries you ask for will fall within this envelope, plotting them does little to clear the fog of uncertainty. We note that all three referees agree that our model can account for two robust trends, i) in apposition eyes L increase with optical resolving power and acuity, both within individual eyes and among eyes of different sizes, and ii) L is much longer is apposition eyes than in simple eyes. Nonetheless, the scatter of data points and their failure to fit creates a bad impression. We gave a number of reasons why the model does not fit the data points, but these were scattered throughout the Results and Discussion and, as referees 1 and 3 point out, this makes it difficult to draw convincing conclusions. To rectify this failing, we have rewritten two sections, in the Results Flies invest efficiently in costly photoreceptor arrays and in the Discussion, How efficiently do insects allocate resources within their apposition eyes?, to discuss these reasons en bloc, draw conclusions and suggest how better data and refinements to modelling could resolve these issues.</p>
<p>Throughout the figures, the discontinuities in the optimal cuts through parameter space are not sufficiently explained.</p>

<p>We added a couple of sentences that address the “jumps” (lines 313 – 318)</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>None of the data seems to hug any of the optimal lines and only weakly follow the trends shown in the plots. This makes interpretation difficult for the reader and should be better explained.

<p>Thank you: this is most pleasing. We submitted our study to eLife because it allows longer Discussions, but we worried that ours was too long. However, we felt that our extensive Discussion was necessary for two reasons. First, we are introducing a new approach to understanding of eye design and evolution. Second, because the data on eye morphology and costs are limited, we had to make a number of assumptions and by discussing these, warts and all, we hoped to encourage experimentalists to gather more data and focus their efforts on the most revealing material.</p>
