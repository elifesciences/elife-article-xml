<abstract>
<title>Abstract</title><p>Dopaminergic neurons (DANs) carry out multiple tasks in the brain, including the transmission of information related to rewards and punishments across various animal species. They are responsible for evaluating sensory input, storing resulting associations as memory, and continuously updating them based on their relevance and reliability. Accurate comprehension of the dopaminergic system’s operation necessitates an understanding of the specific functions mediated by individual DANs. To this end, our research employs <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae, which possess approximately 12,000 neurons in their brains, of which only around 1% (approximately 120) are DANs.</p>
<p>The presynaptic projections to the mushroom body (MB) - a brain region pivotal for associative olfactory learning in insects - are limited to only eight larval dopaminergic neurons. These DANs are further subdivided into two clusters: the primary protocerebral anterior medial cluster (pPAM) comprises four cells, and the dorsolateral 1 cluster (DL1) comprises the remaining four cells. Our findings confirm previous research that demonstrates that the pPAM DANs innervating the MB’s medial lobe encode for a gustatory sugar reward signal. Furthermore, we have identified four DANs in the DL1 cluster - DAN-c1, DAN-d1, DAN-f1, and DAN-g1 - each of which innervates distinct compartments of the MB peduncle, lateral appendix, and vertical lobe. Optogenetic activation of DAN-f1 and DAN-g1 alone suffices to substitute for punishment. Furthermore, optogenetic inhibition, calcium imaging results and electron microscopy-based reconstruction of all sensory input circuits to the four DL1 DANs demonstrate that each DAN encodes a different aspect of punishment, with DAN-g1 being of central importance for the salt dependent teaching signal.</p>
<p>To summarize, our investigation has revealed the existence of a cellular division of labor among larval DANs concerning the transmission of dopaminergic reward (pPAM cluster) and punishment signals (DL1 cluster). Individual DANs in each cluster encode for distinct but partially overlapping aspects of the teaching signal. The striking resemblance in the organizing principle of larval DANs with that of its adult counterpart and the mammalian basal ganglion suggests that there may be a limited number of efficient neural circuit solutions available to address more complex cognitive challenges in nature.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>To cope with a constantly changing environment, animals benefit from learning behavioral rules that need constant adaptation and updating. To test this ability, researchers often use Pavlovian or classical conditioning experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Pavlov 1927</xref>), which examine an organism’s capacity to form associations between sensory cues, called conditioned stimuli (CS), and rewards or punishments, referred to as aversive and appetitive unconditioned stimuli (US) or teaching signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Gerber et al 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Glanzman 1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Heisenberg 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Menzel 2022</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c109">Waddell 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c112">Weber et al 2023b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c116">Widmann et al 2018</xref>). Dopaminergic neurons (DANs) and other modulatory neurons mediate teaching signals that allow animals to classify a given CS into positive or negative valence based on past experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Cognigni et al 2018</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Menzel 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c92">Schultz 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c99">Thum &amp; Gerber 2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c110">Watabe-Uchida et al 2017</xref>). For example, when a CS is paired with simultaneous activation of a specific set of DANs in the PAM cluster, larval or adult <italic>Drosophila</italic> subsequently perceive the odor as attractive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Burke et al 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Eschbach et al 2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Liu et al 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">Rohwedder et al 2016</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">Schroll et al 2006</xref>) – a similar effect was seen after optogenetic activation of DANs located in the ventral tegmental area of the mouse brain to induce conditioned place preference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c105">Tsai et al 2009</xref>). In contrast, activation of larval DL1 DANs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Eschbach et al 2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">Schroll et al 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c113">Weiglein et al 2021</xref>), adult PPL1 DANs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Aso et al 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Aso &amp; Rubin 2016</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Aso et al 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Claridge-Chang et al 2009</xref>), or DANs in the posterior tail of the striatum of mice were shown to reinforce avoidance learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Menegas et al 2018</xref>). These examples illustrate that the dopaminergic system constitutes a highly conserved and fundamental neural principle of the brain, which has been retained throughout the process of evolution and executes comparable functions across diverse animal species, including even humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Frick et al 2022</xref>).</p>
<p>Our research focuses on the <italic>Drosophila</italic> larva, an organism endowed with a relatively simple central nervous system, composed of approximately 12,000 neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Dumstrei et al 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c117">Winding et al 2023</xref>). Classical conditioning in larvae can be analyzed by standardized behavioral assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Almeida-Carvalho et al 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Apostolopoulou et al 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">Scherer et al 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c111">Weber et al 2023a</xref>), in conjunction with a wealth of genetic methods for targeting single molecules and neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Dietzl et al 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Li et al 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Perkins et al 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Port et al 2020</xref>). In addition, the connectome of the brain was recently reconstructed, which enables the extraction and analysis of related wiring motifs, as well as entire learning and memory circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c117">Winding et al 2023</xref>). Based on these advances, it was possible to establish a more fundamental cellular and synaptic understanding of the larval memory circuit, the mushroom body (MB) network. The MB is a higher-order parallel fiber system present in numerous invertebrate brains, including hemimetabolous as well as holometabolous insects and their larval stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c96">Strausfeld et al 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c97">Strausfeld et al 2020</xref>). Analogous to the vertebrate cerebrum, the MB in insects is responsible for forming and maintaining associations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Heisenberg 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Menzel 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Menzel 2022</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c99">Thum &amp; Gerber 2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c102">Tomer et al 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c109">Waddell 2013</xref>). In the first developmental stage (L1), the larval MB comprises approximately 110 intrinsic Kenyon cells (KC) per hemisphere, which sparsely encode for conditioned stimulus (CS) information, and is dominated by olfactory input (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Eichler et al 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Masuda-Nakagawa et al 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>The transmission of olfactory information from the peripheral sensory organ is achieved via only 21 olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) per body side, which in turn send signals across 35 uni- and multiglomerular projection neurons, ultimately reaching the MB KCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Berck et al 2016</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Fishilevich et al 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Kreher et al 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Masuda-Nakagawa et al 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Ramaekers et al 2005</xref>). KCs receive modulatory input from 17 neurons, consisting of eight dopaminergic neurons, four octopaminergic neurons, and five neurons with unknown signaling molecule identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Eichler et al 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">Rohwedder et al 2016</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">Saumweber et al 2018</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93">Selcho et al 2009</xref>). The DANs are divided into two clusters based on the location of their soma and related neuronal lineage, namely the primary protocerebral anterior medial cluster (pPAM) and the dorsolateral 1 cluster (DL1). Each DAN innervates a specific and non-overlapping site in the MB, which, together with one to three output neurons, defines a distinct compartment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Eichler et al 2017</xref>). The larval MB comprises a total of 11 compartments, eight of which are defined by DAN input (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Eichler et al 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">Saumweber et al 2018</xref>). The four DANs of the pPAM cluster (DAN-h1, DAN-i1, DAN-j1, and DAN-k1) innervate the four related compartments (h, i, j, and k) of the medial lobe and provide teaching signals for sugar rewards (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Eichler et al 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">Rohwedder et al 2016</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">Schleyer et al 2020</xref>). The four DANs of the DL1 cluster (DAN-c1, DAN-d1, DAN-f1, and DAN-g1) innervate the lower peduncle (c), the lateral appendix (d), the intermediate (f), and the lower vertical lobe (g) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Eichler et al 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">Saumweber et al 2018</xref>). Previous studies have shown that the DL1 cluster is capable of mediating aversive teaching signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Eschbach et al 2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">Schroll et al 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93">Selcho et al 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c113">Weiglein et al 2021</xref>). Moreover, larvae can use a variety of natural stimuli as aversive teaching signals such as heat, electric shock, vibration, bitter substances (like quinine or caffeine), and high salt concentrations (low salt concentrations, however, are rewarding) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Aceves-Pina &amp; Quinn 1979</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Apostolopoulou et al 2016</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Apostolopoulou et al 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Eschbach et al 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Gerber &amp; Hendel 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Khurana et al 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Khurana et al 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Niewalda et al 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Pauls et al 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c107">von Essen et al 2011</xref>). However, it is currently unknown if and how these natural stimuli are represented by the DL1 cluster.</p>
<p>We only know that optogenetic stimulation of nociceptive sensory neurons and their downstream basin neurons has been observed to activate three out of the four DL1 DANs, namely DAN-d1, DAN-f1, and DAN-g1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Eschbach et al 2020</xref>). Furthermore, the simultaneous presentation of odor with optogenetic activation of these three DANs has been found to elicit aversion in larvae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Eschbach et al 2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c113">Weiglein et al 2021</xref>). These findings suggest that the activation of DL1 DANs may induce a punishing effect during training, based on somatosensory perception. But can these four individual DANs also process other aversive sensory modalities such as chemosensory information? Utilizing electron microscopy-based reconstruction, all first and second order input neurons of the MB, consisting of a complete set of 102 neuron pairs, were examined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Eschbach et al 2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c117">Winding et al 2023</xref>). The analysis identified numerous afferent sensory inputs via 20 pairs of feedforward neurons (FFNs), which can now be integrated with the published wiring diagram of all chemosensory input neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Miroschnikow et al 2018</xref>). This enables a more comprehensive understanding of the distinct modes of action of the four DL1 DANs in relation to the processing of different sensory modalities.</p>
<p>Consequently, we have investigated the role of the four DL1 DANs in the larval brain regarding their involvement in encoding a salt-dependent aversive teaching signal at the single-cell level. Utilizing behavioral assays, fluorescence microscopy, calcium imaging experiments, and connectome analyses, we have established a more comprehensive description of the coding space of the DANs at the single-cell level. Our investigation unveils a cellular specialization among the four DL1 DANs, where individual DANs code for different but partially overlapping aspects of the aversive teaching signal</p>

<title>The larval dopaminergic system is functionally bipartite to convey positive and negative teaching signals</title>
<p>There are eight DANs in the larval brain that innervate the mushroom body that can be anatomically subdivided into four pPAM cluster and four DL1 cluster neurons (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A-C</xref> and <xref rid="fig1s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1- figure supplement 1 A-C</xref>). Three of the four pPAM cluster DANs can be labeled with the driver line R58E02-Gal4 (<xref rid="fig1s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1- figure supplement 1A-E</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">Rohwedder et al 2016</xref>). Pairing an odor presentation with simultaneous optogenetic blue light activation of R58E02 positive DANs using a mutant microbial-type rhodopsin ChR2<sup>XXL</sup>, which depolarizes neurons artificially (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Dawydow et al 2014</xref>), establishes an appetitive olfactory memory (<xref rid="fig1s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1- figure supplement 1F</xref> and <xref rid="fig1s1" ref-type="fig">G</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">Rohwedder et al 2016</xref>). Please be aware that the activation of blue light itself does not cause any disruptive behavioral side effects, as it does not independently induce memory formation. In line with this finding, it was shown that ablation or inhibition of R58E02 positive DANs strongly reduces appetitive olfactory memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">Rohwedder et al 2016</xref>) but has no functional significance for aversive olfactory memory (<xref rid="fig1s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1- figure supplement 1H</xref> and <xref rid="fig1s1" ref-type="fig">I</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">Rohwedder et al 2016</xref>). Therefore, it can be concluded that pPAM cluster DANs are not involved in the encoding of aversive teaching signals. How are aversive teaching signals encoded?</p>

However, expression of a UAS-mCD8::GFP reporter via TH-GAL4 labels many more neurons (in green, anti-GFP) throughout the entire CNS (in red and blue, anti-N-cadherin and anti-discs large), in total about 100 neurons. <bold>(F)</bold> To test whether optogenetic activation of the DL1 DANs is sufficient to substitute for a punishment, we used the TH-GAL4 driver in combination with UAS-ChR<sup>XXL</sup>. Experimental and control larvae were trained by simultaneously presenting and odor and blue light and thus artificial activation of DL1 DANs, whereas a second odor was presented in darkness. Only larvae of the experimental genotype (p &gt; 0.05, N=15), but not of the two genetic controls (both p &lt; 0.05, for each group N=15), retrieve an aversive associative olfactory memory. The same result was seen after one or three training trials (<bold>F</bold> and <bold>G</bold>, respectively). <bold>(H, I)</bold> To test for the acute function of the DL1 DANs in aversive associative olfactory memory, we expressed GtACR2 via the TH-GAL4 driver. Acute optogenetic inhibition of synaptic output from DL1 and other DANs reduced odor high salt memory. Experimental larvae raised on supplemented food (0.5 mM all-<italic>trans</italic>-retinal, ATR) and trained in blue light performed on a lower level than control animals kept on standard food (p &lt; 0.05, for each group N=15).

<p>The driver line TH-Gal4 can be used to label the four DANs of the DL1 cluster (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A-E</xref>), as well as most other DANs, except for a small subset of DANs, such as pPAM DANs and neurons in the subesophageal zone (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D and E</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93">Selcho et al 2009</xref>). By coupling odor presentation with simultaneous optogenetic activation of TH-Gal4 positive DANs through ChR2<sup>XXL</sup>, an aversive olfactory memory can be established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">Schroll et al 2006</xref>), which was observed after both one (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>) and three (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G</xref>) odor-DAN activation pairings. Consistent with these findings, aversive associative memory formed after one or three training cycles of odor high salt pairings were significantly reduced when DANs activity was inhibited optogenetically via GtACR2 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1H and I</xref>), a light-gated channel from the algae <italic>Guillardia theta</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Mohammad et al 2017</xref>). The observed partial reduction may be attributable to biological, technical, or systemic factors, or a combination of these (a more detailed description can be found in the corresponding part of the discussion).In these experiments salt has to be added during the test to initiate the recall of the aversive memory (indicated as red test plates, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F-I</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Gerber &amp; Hendel 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">Schleyer et al 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">Schleyer et al 2011</xref>). Previous studies have shown that the larva only recalls aversive odor-high salt memory when tested in the presence of the teaching signal. The prevailing explanation suggests that the larva engages in memory-based search during the test, but only if the memory content can be used in a beneficial way (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Gerber &amp; Hendel 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">Schleyer et al 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">Schleyer et al 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Based on our findings and previously published data on both larval and adult stages, we propose a functional division of labor among DANs projecting to the MB. Specifically, pPAM neurons are likely to convey a dopaminergic appetitive teaching signal, whereas DL1 neurons may transmit a dopaminergic aversive teaching signal. Nevertheless, the findings related to DL1 DANs necessitate additional validation as the TH-Gal4 driver line used in the experiment labels approximately 120 cells, thus limiting the ability to draw cell-specific conclusions.</p>

In addition, we used the split-Gal4 lines MB065B (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>), SS01702 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2G</xref>) and MB054B (Figure H-K) that specifically labeled DAN-c1/DAN-f1, DAN-c1/MBIN-e1 or DAN-f1/DAN-g1, respectively. For our evaluation we crossed each split-Gal4 line with the reporter strain UAS-mCD8::GFP;mb247-LexA,lexAop-mRFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Burke et al 2012</xref>) that allowed us to monitor the expression pattern (green) in the background of a MB specific reference staining (magenta). Our results confirm the reported specificity even despite the use of different reporter lines and lacking antibody staining (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Eschbach et al 2020</xref>), as we analyzed only endogenous GFP expression using a more cautious and faster whole mount staining protocol (see Material and Methods). In addition, we also verified that the DANs labeled via MB054B are indeed dopaminergic as the GFP expression overlaps with an anti-TH antibody staining (<xref rid="fig2s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2- figure supplement 2</xref>). Having established anatomical validity, we subsequently employed these lines to explore the physiological response of each DAN within the DL1 cluster to sugar and salt stimuli. For the purpose of analyzing DAN-d1 and DAN-f1, we limited our investigation to the split-Gal4 lines MB328B and SS02180 as these lines displayed more robust expression levels.</p>

<title>Physiological single-cell analysis of DL1 DANs</title>
<p>In order to investigate how high salt teaching signals are represented at the level of individual DL1 DANs, we conducted calcium imaging experiments using a microfluidic chip on intact and immobilized larvae, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c94">Si et al 2019</xref>). We expressed GCaMP6m under the control of four different split-Gal4 lines specific to DL1 DANs (SS02160 (DAN-c1), MB328B (DAN-d1), SS02180 (DAN-f1), and SS01716 (DAN-g1)), as well as the pPAM specific R58E02-Gal4, and exposed the larvae to solutions containing 100 mM salt, 1 M salt, or 500 mM fructose. Our results showed that only DAN-c1 responded to 100 mM salt (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). While DAN-c1, DAN-d1, and DAN-g1 responded to 1 M salt (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>, B, and D). Conversely, pPAM DANs showed a reduced signal in response to 1 M salt (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>). Both DAN-c1 and pPAM DANs showed a calcium increase in response to 500 mM fructose (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A and E</xref>). Although DAN-f1 did not respond to either salt concentration, a reduction in the calcium signal was seen for 500 mM fructose (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>). Overall, these results provide support for the functional division of the larval dopaminergic system at the physiological level, where most DL1 neurons are activated by high salt concentrations, with one exception inhibited by fructose. In contrast, pPAM cluster neurons display the opposite response, being inhibited by high salt concentrations and strongly activated by fructose.</p>

We employed split-Gal4 lines SS02160 (DAN-c1), MB328B (DAN-d1), SS02180 (DAN-f1), and SS01716 (DAN-g1) to express the apoptosis proteins Hid and Reaper, resulting in the ablation of the respective individual DL1 DANs. The ablated animals were subjected to the aversive odor-high salt memory assay, using one (<xref rid="fig4s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 4- figure supplement 1A-D</xref>) and three training cycles (<xref rid="fig4s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 4- figure supplement 1E-H</xref>). We utilized two different training protocols to differentiate between the effects on short-term memory (STM) and anesthesia-resistant memory (ARM), as previous studies have demonstrated that larvae exhibit both after one training cycle, whereas only ARM is present after three training cycles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c115">Widmann et al 2016</xref>). However, we found that the ablation of individual DL1 DANs had no effect on aversive olfactory memories in any of the eight experiments conducted (<xref rid="fig4s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 4- figure supplement 1A-H</xref>). For DAN-d1 and DAN-f1 we verified these results by using the additional split-Gal4 lines MB143B and MB145B (<xref rid="fig2s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2- figure supplement 1D-G</xref>). In addition, ablation of DAN-d1, DAN-f1 and DAN-g1 individually did not have any impact on odor-quinine and odor-fructose memories established after one cycle training (<xref rid="fig4s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 4- figure supplement 2</xref> and <xref rid="fig4s3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Moreover, MB input neurons that are not dopaminergic (OAN-a1, a2, MBIN-b1, b2, and OAN-e1) were also found to have no relevant effect (<xref rid="fig4s4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4- figure supplement 4</xref>). These results suggest that although DL1 DANs respond to high salt concentrations (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>), they are not individually necessary in ablation experiments for mediating the aversive teaching signal. The data suggest that the aversive teaching signal may be distributed across multiple neurons, indicating possible functional redundancy or, alternatively, developmental compensation that could attenuate the effects of DL1 cell ablation. However, it is possible that there are developmental compensatory effects for DL1 cluster DANs, allowing the remaining three neurons (or other cells) to take over the function of the ablated one. This hypothesis was analyzed later in optogenetic inhibition experiments.</p>

<title>The combination of DAN-f1 and DAN-g1 is required to establish aversive odor-high salt memories</title>
<p>In order to investigate a possible redundancy among DANs, we proceeded by using split- Gal4 lines MB054B (DAN-f1/DAN-g1), MB065B (DAN-c1/DAN-f1), and SS01702 (DAN-c1/MBIN-e1) to express apoptosis proteins Hid and Reaper. This approach selectively ablated either two DL1 DANs or one DL1 DAN and another MB input neuron with unknown neurotransmitter identity. It should be noted that no additional split-Gal4 lines are presently available for further DL1 DAN combinations or the complete DL1 cluster. We then subjected the larvae to the aversive odor-high salt memory assay, using one (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A-C</xref>) and three (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D-F</xref>) training cycles. Only larvae with ablated DAN-f1/DAN-g1 exhibited significantly reduced aversive olfactory memory after one cycle training (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). No memory reduction was observed when ablating DAN-c1/DAN-f1 or DAN-c1/MBIN-e1 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B and C</xref>). Ablation of all three sets of neurons, including MB054B, had no effect on aversive olfactory memory after three training cycles (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D-F</xref>). To ascertain the independence of the DAN-f1/DAN-g1 neuron-mediated impairment of aversive olfactory memory after one cycle training from the specific odors used, hexyl acetate and benzaldehyde were employed instead of amyl acetate and benzaldehyde. The results of these experiments confirmed the previous findings, as ablation of DAN-f1/DAN-g1 neurons significantly reduced aversive odor-high salt memory after one cycle training (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4G</xref>), but not after three cycles (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4J</xref>). Innate olfactory and gustatory behavior was not impaired by DAN-f1/DAN-g1 ablation (<xref rid="fig4s5" ref-type="fig">Figure 4- figure supplement 5</xref>).</p>
<p>Subsequently, we investigated the selectivity of DAN-f1/DAN-g1 neurons concerning the nature of the aversive teaching stimulus. To this end, we utilized quinine as an aversive teaching signal, a stimulus that has been demonstrated to be learnable by the larva, as evidenced by previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Apostolopoulou et al 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">El-Keredy et al 2012</xref>). Removal of the DAN-f1/DAN-g1 neurons using the split-Gal4 line MB054B had no effect on aversive odor-quinine memory independent of the number of training cycles (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4H and K</xref>). Furthermore, ablation of DAN-f1/DAN-g1 did not alter appetitive odor-fructose memories after one or three training cycles (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4I and L</xref>). Therefore, the DL1 DAN-f1/DAN-g1 combination seems to be specifically required for aversive odor-high salt memory. This is further supported by anatomical data that verified the effectiveness of Hid and Reaper using the MB054B split-Gal4 line (<xref rid="fig4s6" ref-type="fig">Figure 4- figure supplement 6</xref>).</p>

We used split-Gal4 lines SS02160, MB328B, SS02180, SS01716, and MB054B, respectively (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>).

Additionally, this memory is observed after one (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref>) and three training cycles (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5F</xref>). Furthermore, single-cell analysis indicates that individual activation of DAN-f1 and DAN-g1, but not of DAN-d1 and DAN-c1 (please note that experimental animals are different from zero and significantly different to one control), can induce an aversive odor memory (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A-D</xref>).</p>

<title>An individual DL1 DAN is acutely necessary to establish an aversive odor-high salt memory</title>
<p>Next, we examined the extent to which the individual DL1 DANs are acutely required for the transmission of a functional aversive teaching signal. We have already shown that the combination of DAN-f1/DAN-g1 is required for aversive odor-high salt memory (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A and G</xref>). However, in these experiments DANs were removed during the entire development, which may have led to compensatory mechanisms or side effects.</p>
<p>To overcome this limitation, we left the individual DL1 DANs intact during embryonic and larval development and used GtACR2 to selectively inhibit DAN activity only during training, thus isolating the teaching signals from other DAN functions. Optogenetic inhibition of individual DL1 DANs showed no effect on aversive odor-high salt memories (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A-C</xref>), except for DAN-g1 that led to a small but significant reduction (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D</xref>). Optogenetic inhibition of DAN-f1/DAN-g1 resulted in a similar reduced aversive odor-high salt memory. This was the case after one training cycle (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6E</xref>) and three training cycles (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6F</xref>). Thus, the learning deficit in this experiment was more pronounced than after ablation of these two DL1 DANs throughout development (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>).</p>

<title>A synaptic reconstruction of all chemosensory inputs for each individual DL1 and pPAM DAN</title>
<p>Certainly, a comprehensive analysis from the sensory neurons responsible for salt perception, via the interneurons involved in salt information processing, up to the dopaminergic DL1 teaching neurons would be highly desirable to understand why and how the different DANs respond to salt. Regrettably, such an analysis is currently not feasible due to our limited understanding of salt perception and which sensory cells encode this crucial information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Liu et al 2003</xref>). Therefore, this question cannot be answered by the larval connectome. However, it is possible to analyze how qualitative differences between individual DL1 DANs (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>-<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>) are represented in the connectome, since not all DANs code equally for the punishment teaching signal. Therefore, we compared the input wiring diagrams of the individual DANs of the pPAM and DL1 clusters by mapping the synaptic connections from sensory neurons - to interneurons - to individual DANs, using the full larval brain EM volume (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>, <xref rid="fig7s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 7- figure supplement 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Eschbach et al 2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Miroschnikow et al 2018</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c117">Winding et al 2023</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>We found that DAN-c1, DAN-d1, DAN-f1, and DAN-g1 (black circle) clearly differ in their downstream connections. They do however receive input from 1, 6, 6 or 11 sensory-to-DAN interneurons (orange circle), respectively (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A</xref>), which in turn means that these DL1 DANs are connected to 3, 42, 35, and 9 sensory neurons (numbers in colored circuits below). Please note that we restricted our analysis on direct sensory-to-DANs interneurons (single hop analysis) and did not expand the analysis onto two hop or three hop connections to keep the evaluation restricted to the shortest paths from sensory neurons to DANs. There is no direct input from sensory neurons onto DL1 DANs. Sensory input thus appears to be increasingly instructing DAN-c1, DAN-d1, DAN-f1, and DAN-g1. The analysis also shows that all four DL1 DANs receive information from all gustatory senses via these interneurons (coded by the yellow color for sensory composition). In addition, DAN-d1, as well as DAN-f1, receive information from olfactory and thermosensory neurons (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7D</xref>). In general, less processed sensory input seems to be more important for DAN-f1 and DAN-g1 than for DAN-c1 and DAN-d1, as they get 17% and 11% of their entire input from these sensory-to-DAN interneurons in contrast to 1% and 5%, respectively. The four DL1 DANs show a conserved connection motif, as they get additional input from other upstream neurons (US) that are not directly linked to sensory neurons (grey circles; between 17% and 37%), as well as from MB KCs (purple circles; between 36% and 49%) and little MBON feedback (dark-red circle; between 1% and 2%). Examination of the different input types of DL1 DANs presented here, shows that DAN-f1 and DAN-g1 receive the highest proportion of sensory input relative to other DANs. Even by looking at the sensory-to-DAN interneurons individually, one can again see the familiar pattern of differences and partial overlap (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7D</xref>). DAN-d1, DAN-f1 und DAN-g1 all get input from interneuron pair 1 in contrast to DAN-c1. However again, DAN-f1 and DAN-g1 are most strongly connected to this neuronal pair (indicated by the thickness of the lines). DAN-f1 and DAN-g1 are therefore also the most similar in terms of their gustatory input (due to their connection via interneuron pair 1), despite all the clearly recognizable differences.</p>
<p>For the pPAM DANs we found the same general connectivity principles as for DL1 DANs regarding input from MBONs, KCs, and non-sensory upstream neurons (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig 7B</xref>). Please note that the DAN-h1 neuron is not present at the early L1 EM brain volume and thus cannot be included in this evaluation (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7B and E</xref>). In contrast, however, it is striking that pPAM DANs seem to get input from more interneurons connected to the sensory system (up to 16 for DAN-j1) signaling additional internal somatosensory and CO<sub>2</sub> information. A closer inspection of the sensory-to-DAN interneurons showed that 27 of the 35 neurons are specifically innervating only DL1 or pPAM DANs (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7C</xref>). Only 8 out of 35 interneurons connect to both clusters. Based on a calculated hub score sensory-to-DAN interneurons pair 1 (FB2IN-12) and pair 5 (FFN-21) were likely most significant for instructing DL1 DANs with sensory information. Whereas pairs 10 (FFN-17) and 11 (FFN-12) were – based on connectivity – most important in instructing DL1 and pPAM DANs. For the three pPAM DANs sensory-to-DAN interneuron pairs 16, 17, 18, 19 and 20 resulted in the highest hub scores (FFN-37, FFN-4, FFN-5, FFN-18 and FB-4).</p>
<p>The difference in cellular connectivity of DL1 and pPAM DANs is also reflected in different local input brain hubs: axo-dendritic synapses of sensory-to-DAN interneurons with DL1 DANs formed a characteristic hook-shape in the superior protocerebrum; in contrast, pPAM DANs get synaptic input from sensory-to-DAN interneurons in the anterior inferior protocerebrum (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7F</xref>).</p>

The principle appears to apply to mammals as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Groessl et al 2018</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Lammel et al 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Menegas et al 2018</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c92">Schultz 2015</xref>). But how do individual DL1 neurons contribute to the overall teaching signal? Is the signal evenly distributed across multiple cells, supporting the mass action hypothesis, or do individual DANs specifically encode for the salt stimulus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">Rohwedder et al 2016</xref>)? Our results show that the four DL1 DANs perform this function in a mixture of both forms. There is no unique labeled line because both ablation of each individual DAN (<xref rid="fig2s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2- figure supplement 1D-G</xref>, <xref rid="fig4s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 4- figure supplement 1</xref>) and the acute optogenetic inhibition (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>) do not abolish the odor-high salt memory. The teaching signal is encoded in a redundant manner within the DL1 cluster, yet its distribution among the four DANs is non-uniform and relies heavily on the functionalities of DAN-g1 and DAN-f1 (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>-<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). Each DAN possesses a distinct identity, which is defined by its specific, albeit partially overlapping, neuronal input circuitry and physiological response to salt (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref> and <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>).</p>

</table-wrap>
<p>DAN-c1 responds to both positive and negative gustatory stimuli (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). However, the activity of the cell is not sufficient or necessary for aversive memory (<xref rid="fig4s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 4- figure supplement 1A</xref> and <xref rid="fig4s1" ref-type="fig">E</xref>, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>). These results suggest that DAN-c1 activity does not encode a taste-specific teaching signal, which is supported by EM analysis, as this particular cell is only weakly connected to three sensory neurons via a single sensor-to-DAN interneuron (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A and D</xref>). However, this interpretation might depend on the type and duration of DAN stimulation, as it was recently shown that - as in our case - optogenetic activation does not induce aversive memory, but thermogenetic 30 minute stimulation in a non-reciprocal one trail paradigm leads to aversive memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Qi et al 2024</xref>). In addition, it could also be that the function of DAN-c1 is more to integrate state-dependent network changes, similar to the role of some DANs in innate and state-dependent preference behavior of adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Boto et al 2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Cazale-Debat et al 2024</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Cohn et al 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Lewis et al 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Mohammad et al 2024</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c95">Siju et al 2020</xref>). DAN-d1 activity appears to have a negligible impact on the formation of odor-high salt memories in the paradigms we tested. Even though the neuron responds to high salt concentrations (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>) and receives input from 42 sensory neurons via six sensor-to-DAN interneurons (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A and D</xref>), its activity did not induce an aversive memory (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>) and was not found to be essential for odor-high salt memory (<xref rid="fig2s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2- figure supplement 1D</xref> and <xref rid="fig2s1" ref-type="fig">E</xref>, <xref rid="fig4s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 4- figure supplement 1B</xref> and <xref rid="fig4s1" ref-type="fig">F</xref>, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>). Nonetheless, it is possible that DAN-d1 could instruct other salt-dependent memory types, established after non-associative training, second-order conditioning, or reversal learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Kacsoh et al 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Konig et al 2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Mancini et al 2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Paranjpe et al 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c98">Tabone &amp; de Belle 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c118">Yamada et al 2023</xref>). Other learning experiments in larvae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Eschbach et al 2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c113">Weiglein et al 2021</xref>) demonstrate that DAN-d1 activation can indeed guide the formation of aversive odor memory. However, these studies employ three training repetitions rather than a single repetition, as in our approach. Additionally, they utilize absolute conditioning with a single odor, in contrast to our protocol of differential conditioning involving two odors. Furthermore, their testing does not incorporate salt as an aversive gustatory stimulus. The observed differences in results suggest that DAN-d1 activation may only establish aversive memory if the stimulation is applied multiple times and is more distinctly presented during training. . In combination, DAN-f1 activity and DAN-g1 seem to have a crucial function in high salt punishment. DAN-f1 is inhibited by sugar (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>) and obtains input from 35 sensory neurons through six sensor-to-DAN interneurons (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A and D</xref>). Despite ablation and acute suppression of activity having no impact on the retention of a memory related to a high salt stimulus (<xref rid="fig2s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2- figure supplement 1C, E</xref> and <xref rid="fig2s1" ref-type="fig">G</xref>, <xref rid="fig4s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 4- figure supplement 1C</xref> and <xref rid="fig4s1" ref-type="fig">G</xref>, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>), DAN-f1 activity can instruct the formation of an aversive memory (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>). However, there is the possibility that the impact of the ablation experiments could be more pronounced than what is observed here, given the potential for developmental compensation. This has been anatomically demonstrated in the adult dopamine mutants by serotonergic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Niens et al 2017</xref>). The identified function for DAN-f1 activity is consistent with previous research, although their experimental designs differ from our own in the test situation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Eschbach et al 2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c113">Weiglein et al 2021</xref>). Consequently, it is plausible that DAN-f1 activity encodes for a teaching signal that carries additional information beyond high salt. It is evident that DAN-g1 exerts the most potent effect. Following exposure to high salt, this cell becomes active (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>), is crucial for the formation of an odor-high salt memory (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D</xref>) and can even establish an aversive memory that can be recalled on a high salt containing test plate (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>). Additionally, it receives extensive sensory input from nine neurons through 11 distinct interneurons (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A and D</xref>). Therefore, DAN-g1 is the only cell of the DL1 cluster that satisfies all prerequisites to independently encode the high salt teaching signal. In summary, the DL1 cluster appears to be arranged in a reasonable functional configuration. The instructive signal is encoded by a mere four cells, with the requisite of partial redundancy to preclude complete loss of function in the event of single-cell failure. Nevertheless, the cells manifest variation, thereby covering different and cumulative characteristics of stimulation.</p>
<p>However, these cellular-level interpretations are inevitably oversimplified. The MB054B split line occasionally exhibits a weak indication of a third cell (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2J</xref>), introducing a degree of variability in the experiments. Similarly, DAN-f1 demonstrates no direct response to salt (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>), suggesting it is not essential for salt learning, yet it triggers a potent aversive memory (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>). Nevertheless, it is worth mentioning that the physiological and EM analyses were conducted using first instar larvae, whereas the light microscopy experiments and behavioral tests were performed with third instar larvae. Hence, it is possible that developmental-specific alterations may have occurred, which were not accounted for in this study. Regrettably, our understanding of how salt is perceived in larvae remains limited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Liu et al 2003</xref>). Assuming peripheral organ perception as primary, the left and right interneuron 1 (also called FB2IN-12), connected to DAN-d1, DAN-f1, and DAN-g1, is presumed to be centrally important as it encodes for the main peripheral gustatory information (encoded by yellow color, <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7C</xref>, first and second line). However, these DANs display no response to low salt concentrations and varying responses to high salt concentrations and fructose. In contrast, DAN-c1 is the only cell that responds to high and low concentrations of salt (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>) but is not connected to interneuron pair 1 or other sensory-to DAN interneurons (except interneuron 20L; <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7C</xref>). Further experiments are therefore necessary to refine our initial cellular-level description and comprehend the functional spectrum of individual DL1 DANs more comprehensively.</p>
<p>Furthermore, other factors must also be taken into account. Blocking almost all TH-positive cells does not result in the complete disappearance of the salt memory. Instead, it is merely reduced by half (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1H and I</xref>). There could be several reasons for this outcome, or a combination thereof. For example, it is plausible that the UAS-GtACR2 effector does not completely suppress the activity of dopaminergic neurons. Additionally, the memory may encompass different types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c115">Widmann et al 2016</xref>), not all of which are associated with dopamine function. It is also noteworthy that TH-Gal4 does not encompass all dopaminergic neurons - even a neuron from the DL1 cluster is missing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93">Selcho et al 2009</xref>). Considering that we are using high salt concentrations in this experiment, it is also conceivable that no taste-driven memories are formed solely due to the systemic effects of salt (e.g., increased osmotic pressure). These effects naturally complicate the interpretation of the data at the single-cell level.</p>

<p>Larvae, of course, perceive not only high salt concentrations as punishing, but also other sensory stimuli such as bitter substances (quinines and caffeine), electric shock, temperature, mechanosensory input (vibration), and light (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Aceves-Pina &amp; Quinn 1979</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Apostolopoulou et al 2016</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Apostolopoulou et al 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Eschbach et al 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Gerber &amp; Hendel 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Khurana et al 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Pauls et al 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c107">von Essen et al 2011</xref>). However, the extent to which the DL1 cluster is involved in coding for most of these aversive teaching signals remains unclear. Currently, comparisons at the level of DANs can only be made for sensory inputs that are dependent on high salt or mechanosensation. Interestingly, similar to high salt concentrations, somatosensory information can also result in the establishment of aversive olfactory memory in larvae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Eschbach et al 2020</xref>). The transmission of these somatosensory teaching signals is orchestrated by mechanosensory neurons from the chordotonal organs, class IV multidendritic nociceptive neurons distributed along the body, and multisensory basin neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Hwang et al 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Jovanic et al 2016</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Ohyama et al 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c103">Tracey et al 2003</xref>). The connectome revealed that these mechanosensory neurons also link to the DL1 cluster through three to four interneurons and elicit the activation of DAN-d1, DAN-f1, and DAN-g1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Eschbach et al 2020</xref>). Upon comparing the interneurons that relay high salt and mechanosensory information to the DL1 cluster, six pairs of interneurons are of critical significance, respectively. These pairs include FFN-20, FB2N-12, FB2N-19, FFN-23, FFN-29, and FB2N-15 for mechanosensory information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Eschbach et al 2020</xref>), and FB2N-12, FB2N-18, FB2IN-11, FB2IN-6, FFN-21, and FFN-24 for high salt concentrations (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>; <xref rid="fig7s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 7- figure supplement 1A</xref>, rightmost column). Interestingly, only one pair of interneurons - FB2N12 - is shared between the two types of information and the other five types are specific to the sensory modality. The wiring patterns of DAN input neurons exhibit a notable consistency, with a limited number of neurons dedicated to a specific sensory modality, and single neurons shared across different modalities. This results in a unique combination of cellular codes that are partly redundant and partly specific for the four DL1 DANs. While certain DANs may hold greater significance for a particular information, such as DAN-d1 for somatosensory information, the DAN-g1 cell appears to play a general central role for encoding an aversive teaching signal. DAN-g1 responds to all aversive stimuli tested thus far and its activity has proven informative for all aversive memories analyzed to date. In order to gain a deeper comprehension of the processing of diverse sensory modalities in the larval brain, it is crucial to broaden the analytical framework presented in our work to encompass visual stimuli, various bitter substances, and temperature stimuli.</p>
<p>However, the overall depiction presented above of the information flow and processing of DL1 DANs is an oversimplification. Indeed, DL1 and pPAM DANs are among the most complex and highly recurrent neurons in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c117">Winding et al 2023</xref>). This exceptional level of recurrent connectivity enables DANs to provide high-dimensional feedback, which enables them to encode a diverse range of features and engage in parallel computations. Such computations can guide a working memory, contain feedback from neurons that integrate both learned and innate values, and receive long-range feedback from descending neurons that encode motor commands; all in addition to polysynaptic feedforward inputs from the entire set of sensory modalities.</p>

<title>A cellular comparison of DAN function across <italic>Drosophila</italic> metamorphosis</title>
<p>A recent study conducted by Truman and colleagues explored the integration, or lack thereof, of individual input and output neurons from the larval MB into the adult network following metamorphosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c104">Truman et al 2023</xref>). The study demonstrated that while all four DANs of the pPAM cluster perished, three out of the four cells from the DL1 cluster persisted as part of the adult MB circuitry. Only DAN-f1 altered its innervation in the adult brain, relocating from the larval MB to the adult superior medial protocerebrum. In contrast, DAN-c1, DAN-d1, and DAN-g1 maintained their function as MB DANs in the adult system, identified as PPL1-γ1pedc, PPL1-γ2α’1, and PPL1-γ1, respectively. Due to the lack of appropriate genetic tools, data on the function of PPL1-γ1 is scarce (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Aso et al 2014</xref>). Therefore, a functional comparison between larval and adult DANs is only possible for the DAN-c1/PPL1-γ1pedc and DAN-d1/PPL1-γ2α’1 combination. Embryonic-born DAN-c1/PPL1-γ1pedc, DAN-d1/PPL1-γ2α’1, and DAN-g1/PPL1-γ1 exhibit sustained activity and respond to various sensory stimuli, including electric shock, temperature, or bitter taste, that can instruct short lasting aversive memories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Aso et al 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Aso &amp; Rubin 2016</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Aso et al 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Claridge-Chang et al 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Das et al 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Galili et al 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Huang et al 2024</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Kirkhart &amp; Scott 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c101">Tomchik 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c106">Villar et al 2022</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c108">Vrontou et al 2021</xref>). Despite the massive reorganization of the mushroom body, the basic function of DAN-c1/PPL1-γ1pedc and DAN-d1/PPL1-γ2α’1, mediating punishment teaching signals that instruct short-term memories, remains the same. Evidence indicates that the underlying molecular signaling pathways maintain their identity and kinetics throughout development, with larval and adult interstimulus interval curves for DAN-d1/PPL1-γ2α’1 being almost identical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Aso &amp; Rubin 2016</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Huang et al 2024</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c113">Weiglein et al 2021</xref>). During adulthood, PPL1-DANs are responsible for numerous other functions, including innate olfactory responses, suppression of appetite memory in response to nutritional status, pre-exposure learning, memory reconsolidation, and forgetting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Berry et al 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Berry et al 2018</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Felsenberg et al 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Jacob et al 2021</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Krashes et al 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">McCurdy et al 2021</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Placais et al 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c95">Siju et al 2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c100">Tian et al 2016</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c108">Vrontou et al 2021</xref>). Additionally, they are involved in various behaviors like locomotion and sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Berry et al 2015</xref>).</p>
<p>An open question is whether larval DL1 DANs encode these same functions to a similar extent. Our study establishes a fundamental framework that can be leveraged to investigate this issue. Considering the numerical simplicity of the larval nervous system, the available genetic tools, and the complete connectome, it may be possible to attain an understanding of the larval dopaminergic system at the level of single cells and single synapses. It is plausible that nature has a limited number of effective neural circuit solutions for complex cognitive and behavioral problems, such as the remarkable ability of brains to learn from a small number of examples. Therefore, comprehending the larval dopaminergic system may provide insight into the shared circuit motifs that exist across the animal kingdom.</p>

<title>Functional Imaging and microfluidics</title>
<p>For larval imaging experiments, adult flies were transferred to larvae collection cages (Genesee Scientific) containing grape juice agar plates and 180 mg of fresh yeast paste per cage. Flies were allowed to lay eggs on the agar plate for 1–2 days before the plate was removed for collection of larvae. Calcium imaging experiments were performed in L1 larvae (2 days AEL). We used a previously described method for microfluidic delivery of chemicals in aqueous form with simultaneous imaging of calcium activity in intact larvae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c94">Si et al 2019</xref>). All experiments used an 8-channel microfluidic chip equipped with a vacuum port to stabilize the animal’s head. The same tastants were used as in the behavioral experiments (NaCl: VWR Chemicals, cat. no. 27810.364; D-Fructose: Sigma Aldrich cat. no. 47740). Stimuli consisted of 5-10 s pulses interleaved with 15 s water washout periods. An L1 larva was washed with deionized water and loaded into the microfluidic device using a 1 mL syringe filled with Triton X-100 (0.1% [v/v]) solution. The animal was pushed to the end of the loading channel with its dorsal side facing the objective. GCaMP6m signal was recorded using an inverted Nikon Ti-E spinning disk confocal microscope and a 60X water immersion objective (NA 1.2). A CCD microscope camera (Andor iXon EMCCD) captured frames at 30 Hz. Recordings from at least 5–7 larvae were collected for each condition. For each larva the average response over 5s around the peak value during stimulus presentation was compared to chance level analyzed via normal t-test. Responses during stimulation were normalized based on the baseline response 10s before the stimulation. P-values for each experiment are given in the respective figure panel.

Learning experiments were conducted on assay plates (85 mm diameter, Sarstedt, cat. no. 82.1472) filled with a thin layer of either 2.5% (w/v) pure agarose solution (Sigma Aldrich, cat. no. A9539) or 2.5% (w/v) agarose plus either 1.5 M sodium chloride solution (VWR Chemicals, cat. no. 27810.364), 2 M D-Fructose solution (Sigma Aldrich cat. no. 47740) or 10 mM quinine solution (quinine hemisulfate; Sigma Aldrich cat. no. Q1250). Before closing and labeling the lids, solutions were let to cool down at room temperature to avoid condensation. Plates were stored at 18°C and used within five days. As olfactory stimuli, we used two different odor combinations: either amyl acetate (AM, Sigma Aldrich, cat. no. 46022) diluted 1:250 in paraffin oil (Sigma Aldrich, cat. no. 76235) and undiluted benzaldehyde (BA, Sigma Aldrich, cat. no. 12010) or benzaldehyde and hexyl acetate (HA, Sigma Aldrich, cat. no. 108154) both diluted 1:100 in paraffin oil. For both odor combinations, 10 µL odor were loaded into custom-made Teflon containers (4.5 mm diameter) with perforated lids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">Scherer et al 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>A minimum of 30 early third instar larvae were collected and exposed to a first odor (amyl acetate or hexyl acetate) while crawling on pure agarose for five minutes, followed by five minutes exposition to a second odor (benzaldehyde) on agarose medium with either 1.5 M sodium chloride, 10 mM quinine as negative reinforcer or 2 M D-Fructose as positive reinforcer (Odor1/Odor2+). For three cycle training, two more repetitions of training trials were performed. A second group of larvae received reciprocal training (Odor1+/Odor2). Please note that occurrence of odor and reinforcer during training have been randomized to exclude sequential or positional effects. After one or three training cycles, larvae were transferred onto test plates containing either pure agarose (reward learning) or agarose plus salt or quinine (punishment learning) on which odor 1 and odor 2 were represented on opposite sides. After five minutes, larvae were counted on each side of the test plate (#Odor1, #Odor2) or in a 10 mm neutral zone in the middle of the plate (#Neutral).

<title>Evaluation of DAN input wiring diagrams</title>
<p>Pie charts of sensory profiles were calculated using the percentage of total synaptic input of interneurons as fraction (thereby ignoring other inputs to show distribution of sensory origins). Percentages then give the percentage of total sensory synaptic input to interneurons. The calculation of the hub score was done in the following way: Fraction of total synaptic input from all sensory neurons to defined interneurons (see IDs) was multiplied by the total fraction of input of the DANs from this interneuron. For anatomical reconstructions and visualizations included here, we made use of earlier published data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Eichler et al 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Eschbach et al 2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Miroschnikow et al 2018</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c117">Winding et al 2023</xref>).</p>

<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>Behavioral results were analyzed in GraphPad Prism 8.4.3. To test for normal distribution, Shapiro-Wilk test was applied. Groups that did not violate the assumption of normal distribution, were analyzed with an unpaired t-test (comparison of two groups) or a one-way ANOVA followed by a Tukey’s post hoc test (comparisons between groups larger than two). For nonparametric statistics, Mann-Whitney test (comparison between two groups) or Kruskal-Wallis followed by Dunn’s multiple comparisons tests were applied. Furthermore, one sample t-test for parametric or Wilcoxon signed-rank test for nonparametric data sets were performed to compare means or medians against chance level. Results are visualized in box-plots, indicating the median as middle line, 25%/75% quantiles as box boundaries and minimum/maximum performance indices as whiskers. Each data point is represented as black dot and sample sizes are noted within graphics. Asterisks and ‘‘n.s.’’ indicate p &lt; 0.05 and p &gt; 0.05, respectively. The source data and results of all statistical tests are documented in the Supplemental Information file.</p>

<caption><title>The dopaminergic pPAM cluster encodes for a teaching signal in larvae.</title><p><bold>(A, B)</bold> The pPAM cluster (cell bodies in blue) consists of four DANs providing input to the h, i, j, and k compartments of the medial lobe of the mushroom body (MB; in grey) – the larval memory center. <bold>(C)</bold> Schematic representation of the larval MB using single letter acronyms based on (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">Saumweber et al 2018</xref>) to indicate compartment innervation by MB input and output neurons. DL1 DANs specifically innervate the compartments c, d, f and g in the vertical lobe, lateral appendix and peduncle, whereas pPAM DANs innervate the shaft (h) and medial lobe (I, j, k) of the MB. <bold>(D, E)</bold> Three pPAM DANs (DAN-h1, DAN-i1, and DAN-j1) are specifically labeled via the R58E02 driver line. Expression of a UAS-GFP reporter via R58E02 labels only these three DANs (in green, anti-GFP) throughout the entire CNS (in red and blue, anti-N-cadherin and anti-discs large) besides one additional cell that does not innervate the MB (asterisk in <bold>E</bold>). <bold>(F)</bold> To test whether optogenetic activation of the pPAM DANs is sufficient to substitute for a reward, we used the R58E02 driver in combination with UAS-ChR<sup>XXL</sup> to express a modified form of Channelrhodopsin2. Experimental and effector control larvae were trained via presenting and odor stimulus together with blue light stimulation and thus artificial activation of pPAM DANs, whereas a second odor was presented in darkness. Furthermore, a genetic control group received the same training protocol without blue light stimulation. Only larvae of the experimental genotype (p &gt; 0.05), but not of the two genetic controls (both p &lt; 0.05, for each group N=15), retrieve an appetitive associative olfactory memory. This shows that activation of the pPAM DANs is sufficient to mediate a reward teaching signal. The same effect was seen applying one or three training trials (<bold>F and G</bold>, respectively). <bold>(H, I)</bold> To test for the acute function of the pPAM DANs in aversive associative olfactory memory, we expressed GtACR2, an anion-conducting, light-gated channel via the R58E02 driver. Acute optogenetic inhibition of synaptic output from pPAM DANs during training did not change odor high-salt memory. Experimental larvae kept on supplemented food with 0.5 mM all-<italic>trans</italic>-retinal (ATR) or genetic controls, maintained on standard food performed at the same level (p &gt; 0.05, for each group N=15). Intact odor high-salt memory was seen after one or three training trials (<bold>H</bold> and <bold>I</bold>, respectively). All behavioral data is shown as box-plots. Differences between groups are highlighted by horizontal lines between them. Performance indices different from random distribution are indicated below each box-plot.

<p>This comprehensive study presents <bold>important</bold> findings that delineate how specific dopaminergic neurons (DANs) instruct aversive learning in Drosophila larvae exposed to high salt through an integration of behavioral experiments, imaging, and connectomic analysis. The work reveals how a numerically minimal circuit achieves remarkable functional complexity, with redundancies and synergies within the DL1 cluster that challenge our understanding of how few neurons generate learning behaviors. By establishing a framework for sensory-driven learning pathways, the study makes a <bold>compelling</bold> and substantial contribution to understanding associative conditioning while demonstrating conservation of learning mechanisms across Drosophila developmental stages.</p>

<p>In this paper Weber et al. investigate the role of 4 dopaminergic neurons of the Drosophila larva in mediating the association between an aversive high-salt stimulus and a neutral odor. The 4 DANs belong to the DL1 cluster and innervate non-overlapping compartments of the mushroom body, distinct from those involved in appetitive associative learning. Using specific driver lines for individual neurons, the authors show that activation of the DAN-g1 is sufficient to mimic an aversive memory and it is also necessary to form a high-salt memory of full strength, although optogenetic silencing of this neuron has only a partial phenotype. The authors use calcium imaging to show that the DAN-g1 is not the only DAN responding to salt. DAN-c1 and d1 also respond to salt, but they seem to play no role for the associative memory. DAN-f1, which does not respond to salt, is able to lead to the formation of a memory (if optogenetically activated), but it is not necessary for the salt-odor memory formation in normal conditions. However, when silenced together with DAN-g1, it enhances the memory deficit of DAN-g1. Overall, this work brings evidence of a complex interaction between DL1 DANs in both the encoding of salt signals and their teaching role in associative learning, with none of them being individually necessary and sufficient for both functions.</p>
<p>Overall, the manuscript contributes interesting results that are useful to understand the organization and function of the dopaminergic system. The behavioral role of the specific DANs is accessed using specific driver lines which allow to test their function individually and in pairs. Moreover, the authors perform calcium imaging to test whether DANs are activated by salt, a prerequisite for inducing a negative association to it. Proper genetic controls are carried across the manuscript.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this work the authors show that dopaminergic neurons (DANs) from the DL1 cluster in Drosophila larvae are required for the formation of aversive memories. DL1 DANs complement pPAM cluster neurons which are required for the formation of attractive memories. This shows the compartmentalized network organization of how an insect learning center (the mushroom body) encodes memory by integrating olfactory stimuli with aversive or attractive teaching signals. Interestingly, the authors found that the 4 main dopaminergic DL1 neurons act partially redundant, and that single cell ablation did not result in aversive memory defects. However, ablation or silencing of a specific DL1 subset (DAN-f1,g1) resulted in reduced salt aversion learning, which was specific to salt but no other aversive teaching stimuli tested. Importantly, activation of these DANs using an optogenetic approach was also sufficient to induce aversive learning in the presence of high salt. Together with the functional imaging of salt and fructose responses of the individual DANs and the implemented connectome analysis of sensory (and other) inputs to DL1/pPAM DANs this represents a very comprehensive study linking the structural, functional and behavioral role of DL1 DANs. This provides fundamental insight into the function of a simple yet efficiently organized learning center which displays highly conserved features of integrating teaching signals with other sensory cues via dopaminergic signaling.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This is a very careful, precise and meticulous study identifying the main larval DANs involved in aversive learning using high salt as a teaching signal. This is highly interesting because it allows to define the cellular substrates and pathways of aversive learning down to the single cell level in a system without much redundancy. It therefore sets the basis to conduct even more sophisticated experiments and together with the neat connectome analysis opens the possibility to unravel different sensory processing pathways within the DL1 cluster and integration with the higher order circuit elements (Kenyon cells and MBONs). The authors' claims are well substantiated by the data and balanced, putting their data in the appropriate context. The authors also implemented neat pathway analyses using the larval connectome data to its full advantage, thus providing network pathways that contribute towards explaining the obtained results.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Previous comments were fully addressed by the authors.</p>

<p>The study of Weber et al. provides a thorough investigation of the roles of four individual dopamine neurons for aversive associative learning in the Drosophila larva. They focus on the neurons of the DL-1 cluster which already have been shown to signal aversive teaching signals. But the authors go beyond the previous publications and test whether each of these dopamine neurons responds to salt or sugar, is necessary for learning about salt, bitter, or sugar, and is sufficient to induce a memory when optogenetically activated. In addition, previously published connectomic data is used to analyze the synaptic input to each of these dopamine neurons. The authors conclude that the aversive teaching signal induced by salt is distributed across the four DL-1 dopamine neurons, with two of them, DAN-f1 and DAN-g1, being particularly important. Overall, the experiments are well designed and performed, support the authors' conclusions, and deepen our understanding of the dopaminergic punishment system.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) This study provides, at least to my knowledge, the first in vivo imaging of larval dopamine neurons in response to tastants. Although the selection of tastants is limited, the results close an important gap in our understanding of the function of these neurons.</p>
<p>(2) The authors performed a large number of experiments to probe for the necessity of each individual dopamine neuron, as well as combinations of neurons, for associative learning. This includes two different training regimen (1 or 3 trials), three different tastants (salt, quinine and fructose) and two different effectors, one ablating the neuron, the other one acutely silencing it. This thorough work is highly commendable, and the results prove that it was worth it. The authors find that only one neuron, DAN-g1, is partially necessary for salt learning when acutely silenced, whereas a combination of two neurons, DAN-f1 and DAN-g1, are necessary for salt learning when either being ablated or silenced.</p>
<p>(3) In addition, the authors probe whether any of the DL-1 neurons is sufficient for inducing an aversive memory. They found this to be the case for two of the neurons, largely confirming previous results obtained by a different learning paradigm, parameters and effector.</p>
<p>(4) This study also takes into account connectomic data to analyze the sensory input that each of the dopamine neurons receives. This analysis provides a welcome addition to previous studies and helps to gain a more complete understanding. The authors find large differences in inputs that each neuron receives, and little overlap in input that the dopamine neurons of the &quot;aversive&quot; DL-1 cluster and the &quot;appetitive&quot; pPAM cluster seem to receive.</p>
<p>(5) Finally, the authors try to link all the gathered information in order to describe an updated working model of how aversive teaching signals are carried by dopamine neurons to the larva's memory center. This includes important comparisons both between two different aversive stimuli (salt and nociception) and between the larval and adult stages.</p>

<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The authors use two different approaches to silence dopaminergic neurons: optogenetics and induction of apoptosis. The results are not always consistent, but the authors discuss these differences appropriately. In general, the optogenetic approach is more appropriate as developmental compensations are not of major interest for the question investigated.</p>
<p>The physiological data would suggest the role of a certain subset of DANs in salt-odor association, but a different partially overlapping set is necessary in behavioral assays (with a partial phenotype). No manipulation completely abolishes the salt-odor association, leaving important open questions on the identity of the neural circuits involved in this behavior.</p>
<p>The EM data analysis reveals a non-trivial organization of sensory inputs into DANs, but it is difficult to extrapolate a link to the functional data presented in the paper.</p>

Importantly, activation of these DANs using an optogenetic approach was also sufficient to induce aversive learning in the presence of high salt. Together with the functional imaging of salt and fructose responses of the individual DANs and the implemented connectome analysis of sensory (and other) inputs to DL1/pPAM DANs this represents a very comprehensive study linking the structural, functional and behavioral role of DL1 DANs. This provides fundamental insight into the function of a simple yet efficiently organized learning center which displays highly conserved features of integrating teaching signals with other sensory cues via dopaminergic signaling.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This is a very careful, precise and meticulous study identifying the main larval DANs involved in aversive learning using high salt as a teaching signal. This is highly interesting because it allows to define the cellular substrates and pathways of aversive learning down to the single cell level in a system without much redundancy. It therefore sets the basis to conduct even more sophisticated experiments and together with the neat connectome analysis opens the possibility to unravel different sensory processing pathways within the DL1 cluster and integration with the higher order circuit elements (Kenyon cells and MBONs). The authors' claims are well substantiated by the data and balanced, putting their data in the appropriate context. The authors also implemented neat pathway analyses using the larval connectome data to its full advantage, thus providing network pathways that contribute towards explaining the obtained results.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The study of Weber et al. provides a thorough investigation of the roles of four individual dopamine neurons for aversive associative learning in the Drosophila larva. They focus on the neurons of the DL-1 cluster which already have been shown to signal aversive teaching signals. But the authors go beyond the previous publications and test whether each of these dopamine neurons responds to salt or sugar, is necessary for learning about salt, bitter, or sugar, and is sufficient to induce a memory when optogenetically activated. In addition, previously published connectomic data is used to analyze the synaptic input to each of these dopamine neurons. The authors conclude that the aversive teaching signal induced by salt is distributed across the four DL-1 dopamine neurons, with two of them, DAN-f1 and DAN-g1, being particularly important. Overall, the experiments are well designed and performed, support the authors' conclusions, and deepen our understanding of the dopaminergic punishment system.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) This study provides, at least to my knowledge, the first in vivo imaging of larval dopamine neurons in response to tastants. Although the selection of tastants is limited, the results close an important gap in our understanding of the function of these neurons.</p>
<p>(2) The authors performed a large number of experiments to probe for the necessity of each individual dopamine neuron, as well as combinations of neurons, for associative learning. This includes two different training regimen (1 or 3 trials), three different tastants (salt, quinine and fructose) and two different effectors, one ablating the neuron, the other one acutely silencing it. This thorough work is highly commendable, and the results prove that it was worth it. The authors find that only one neuron, DAN-g1, is partially necessary for salt learning when acutely silenced, whereas a combination of two neurons, DAN-f1 and DAN-g1, are necessary for salt learning when either being ablated or silenced.</p>
<p>(3) In addition, the authors probe whether any of the DL-1 neurons is sufficient for inducing an aversive memory. They found this to be the case for two of the neurons, largely confirming previous results obtained by a different learning paradigm, parameters and effector.</p>
<p>(4) This study also takes into account connectomic data to analyze the sensory input that each of the dopamine neurons receives. This analysis provides a welcome addition to previous studies and helps to gain a more complete understanding. The authors find large differences in inputs that each neuron receives, and little overlap in input that the dopamine neurons of the &quot;aversive&quot; DL-1 cluster and the &quot;appetitive&quot; pPAM cluster seem to receive.</p>
<p>(5) Finally, the authors try to link all the gathered information in order to describe an updated working model of how aversive teaching signals are carried by dopamine neurons to the larva's memory center. This includes important comparisons both between two different aversive stimuli (salt and nociception) and between the larval and adult stages.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p>
<p>Here are some minor comments (and some semantics that could be addressed to improve the manuscript)</p>
<p>Title: is the title correct given that c1 and d1 do not really signal punishment?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We think the title is correct and would like to keep it as it is.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>L72 striatum misspelled</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have corrected the error.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>L74 constitute instead of provide?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We made the suggested modification in the text.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>L129: &quot;But can these four individual DANs also process other sensory modalities?&quot; other then what? What was used before?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have made the required change, which now allows us to contrast somatosensory and chemosensory information.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>L172: (Please refer to the discussion regarding the partial reduction of the memory); would be more natural to explain shortly here, or add a sentence before this parenthesis that point to the effect</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We made the requested change in the manuscript and added a short sentence before the parenthesis.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>L182: &quot;DL1 neurons convey a dopaminergic aversive teaching signal&quot; you cannot make this statement from just TH-GAL4!</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree - that's why we have completely revised the sentence and now further restricted it and also refer to further larval and adult published data</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>L264: &quot;possible redundancy among&quot; I don't think you are testing a redundancy here, it is more likely a developmental compensation.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We made the requested change in the sentence and added a potential developmental compensation as an interpretation of our results.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>L296: &quot;to determine if the activation of individual DL1 DANs signals aspects of the natural high salt punishment,&quot; - how can the optogenetic activation tell something about aspects of the natural salt punishment? I understand the fact that salt is present, but still I find it inaccurate</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Our approach is based on the framework established by Bertram Gerber and colleagues over the past two decades in larval Drosophila research. According to this logic, memory recall is dependent on the specific properties of the test context, particularly the type and concentration of the stimulus presented on the test plate. Aversive memory retrieval occurs only when the test conditions closely match those of the training stimulus. Consequently, the larva's behavior on the test plate serves as an indicator of the memory content being recalled. We therefore adhere to this established methodology (Gerber &amp; Hendel, 2006; Schleyer et al., 2011; Schleyer et al., 2015).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>L307 &quot;DAN-f1 and DAN-g1 encode aspects of the natural aversive high salt teaching&quot; you cannot conclude that given that f1 does not even respond to salt. I understand the logic of the salt during test, but I think it is still a stretched interpretation</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree and thus have deleted the sentence.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>L310 &quot;Individual DL1 DANs are acutely necessary&quot; this is too general, it seems that only one is</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have changed the title and now clearly state that this is only one DAN of the DL1 cluster.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p>
<p>In Fig.6 the text flow could be optimized as the authors first mention Fig. 6E,F before they follow up with Fig. 6A-D.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks for bringing this up – we changed it in the revised version of the manuscript. Now 6A-D is mentioned first.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>In Fig.6 the finding that optogenetic inactivation but not ablation of DAN-g1 slightly but significantly reduces aversive salt learning suggests that there is an individual contribution of this DAN in this paradigm. The authors emphasize redundancy of DL1 DANs although the effect size seems comparable between DAN-g1 and DAN-f1,g1 silencing.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In response to this concern and the one of reviewer 2, we have revised the section title and removed the final sentence of the section before to avoid placing emphasis on the potential redundancy of DL1 DANs within this results section.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p>
<p>The authors replied to each issue I raised, and revised their manuscript accordingly. In particular, regarding my major concern (the sufficiency of the neurons for salt-&quot;specific&quot; memories), I think the authors found a good solution.</p>
<p>I have no further comments.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We sincerely thank the reviewer for the positive feedback on our revision. We are pleased that the revised manuscript meets the expectations and appreciate the time and effort invested in the review process.</p>
