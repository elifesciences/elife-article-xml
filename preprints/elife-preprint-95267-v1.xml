<title>Summary</title><p>Cigarette smoking is a well-known risk factor inducing the development and progression of various diseases. Nicotine (NIC) is the major constituent of cigarette smoke. However, knowledge of the mechanism underlying the NIC-regulated stem cell functions is limited. In this study, we demonstrate that NIC increases the abundance and proliferative activity of intestinal stem cells (ISCs) in vivo and ex vivo. Moreover, NIC induces Yes-associated protein (YAP)/Transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ) and Notch signaling in ISCs via α7-nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAchR) and protein kinase C (PKC) activation; this effect was not detected in Paneth cells. The inhibition of Notch signaling by dibenzazepine (DBZ) nullified the effects of NIC on ISCs. NIC enhances in vivo tumor formation from ISCs after loss of the tumor suppressor gene Apc, DBZ inhibited NIC-induced tumor growth. Hence, this study identifies a NIC-triggered pathway regulating the stemness and tumorigenicity of ISCs and suggests the use of DBZ as a potential therapeutic strategy for treating intestinal tumors.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>All tissues and organs are generated from stem cells. Abnormal stem cell functions are significantly associated with age-related organ dysfunction and carcinogenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. Intestinal epithelial turnover is sustained by intestinal stem cells (ISCs) and adjacent Paneth cells. Paneth cells constitute the niche for ISCs that reside at the bottom of the crypts. Most of the ISCs are leucine-rich repeat-containing G-protein-coupled receptor 5 (Lgr5)+ ones that regulate intestinal homeostasis in response to dietary signals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. In the intestine, Lgr5+ ISCs are possibly the origin of precancerous adenomas<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>. For instance, long-term high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity enhances the self-renewal potential of ISC and promotes in vivo formation of tumors via the induction of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor delta in ISCs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Moreover, cigarette smoking has emerged as a potential major risk factor associated with colon cancer, along with metabolic risk factors such as diet and obesity. Previous studies indicate that cigarette smoking is significantly associated with colon cancer and mortality in humans<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup> and animal models<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Cigarette smoke contains a wide range of compounds that are harmful to human health; nicotine (NIC) derivatives 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK) and N’-nitrosonornicotine (NNN) are highly carcinogenic<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>, which can induce mutations in tumor suppressive genes like Ras, p53, and Rb<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>. Although NIC itself, the addictive component in cigarette smoke, is generally considered to have a limited ability to initiate cancer, it can stimulate several effects crucial for cancer development independently<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. However, knowledge of the mechanism underlying the NIC-regulated ISC functions and intestinal tumorigenicity is limited.</p>
<p>In this study, we aimed to demonstrate the effects of NIC treatment on the functions of murine ISCs ex vivo and in vivo. Moreover, we explored the molecular factors and signaling cascades prospectively associated with the regulation of the effects of NIC on ISCs. This study can potentially contribute to the comprehensive knowledge on the pathway by which stem cells respond to NIC, a major component of cigarette smoke, and suggest an effective new strategy for the treatment of smoking-related colon cancer.</p>

<title>NIC treatment enhances the frequency of ISC in the intestine</title>
<p>Histological analyses of the small intestine in C57BL/6 mice treated with 200[μg/ml NIC (which emulates active smoking) revealed that NIC exposure decreased villus length without affecting crypt size (Figure S1A), which was consistent with NIC-induced decrease in the number of differentiated cells, including absorptive enterocytes (Figure S1B) or chromogranin A+ enteroendocrine cells (Figure S1C), in the gut.</p>
<p>We investigated the effect of NIC on the population of proliferative cells in the crypts using Ki67 labeling to mark proliferative stem and progenitor cells in the crypts. NIC exposure increased abundance of Ki67-positive cells in the small and large intestine (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1A and B</xref>). Consistently, the number of proliferative olfactomedin-4 (Olfm4)-positive ISCs significantly increased in the small intestine of NIC-treated mice (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). Moreover, the number of LgR5+ colonic stem cells (CSCs) was increased in NIC-treated <italic>Lgr5-EGFP-IRES-CreERT2</italic> mice expressing EGFP under the control of the LgR5 promoter (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>). Paneth cells support the proliferation of ISCs. However, we did not observe any changes in the number of Paneth cells in NIC-treated mice (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>). These results indicate that the self-renewal of ISCs in NIC-treated mice increased with a reciprocal decrease in the number of differentiated cells.</p>

<title>NIC treatment enhances the formation of intestinal organoids from ISCs</title>
<p>Our ISC proliferation analysis using intestinal crypts of wild-type mice revealed that a range of nicotine concentrations (100nM, 1 µM, and 10 µM) promoted the organoid formation from crypts from the small intestine (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>), which was consistent with the in vivo data (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1A and C</xref>). However, the same dose of cotinine, a minor tobacco alkaloid, and a major metabolite of NIC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup> did not exhibit similar effects (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). Furthermore, the addition of 1 µM NIC promoted the organoid formation from colonic crypts (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). Next, to address how ISCs and Paneth cells interact functionally, we isolated Lgr5-positive ISCs and Paneth cells from control or NIC-treated <italic>Lgr5-EGFP-IRES-CreERT2</italic> mice as described previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. ISCs and Paneth cells were co-cultured in the culture media containing glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β) inhibitor CHIR99021, which induces β-catenin and thus stimulates organoid formation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. Lgr5-positive ISCs isolated from NIC mice formed more organoid colonies than those isolated from control mice when cultured with or without Paneth cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>). Consistently, the addition of 1 µM NIC to control ISCs stimulated the organoid colony formation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>). However, Paneth cells exhibited no significant difference in function (organoid formation) between control and NIC-treated groups, with or without CHIR99021 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2C</xref> and S2A). Therefore, this ex vivo assay for ISC function and ISC–Paneth cell interaction demonstrated that NIC affects ISCs rather than Paneth cells.</p>

<title>The α7 subunits of nAChR control the effects of NIC on ISC proliferation</title>
<p>We investigated the pathway underlying the NIC-regulated proliferation of ISCs. NIC interacts with nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAchRs), which are heterodimers of nine types of α subunits (α2–α10) and three types of β subunits (β2– β4)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>. We validated the significance of nAChR signal transduction using ISCs, isolated wild-type mice cultured in the presence of NIC, and the nonselective nAChR antagonist Mecamylamine, which indicated that Mecamylamine treatment completely abolishes the NIC-mediated formation of ISC-derived organoids (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). We further explored the nAChR subtypes. Considering that NIC has a high affinity for the nAChR comprised of α4 and β2 subunits<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>, we cultured ISCs in the presence of NIC and Adiphenine, a non-competitive inhibitor of nAChR (α1, α3β4, α4β2, and α4β4). However, Adiphenine exhibited no effect on the NIC-induced organoid formation from ISCs, indicating that the effect of NIC was not mediated by these nAChRs (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). As some cancer stem cells are known to express α7-nAChR<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>, we further analyzed the role of α7-nACh. The existence of α7-nAChR in ISCs was detected by immunoblotting and RT-PCR, respectively (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3C and D</xref>). Interestingly, NIC treatment significantly upregulated α7-nAChR in ISCs rather than Paneth cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>). Moreover, addition of the α7-selective nAChR agonist PNU282987 increased organoid colony formation from ISCs (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>), which was consistent with the effects of NIC. Furthermore, α-Bungarotoxin, an α7-selective nAChR antagonist, completely inhibited the NIC-induced increase in organoid formation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref>). These outcomes indicate the effect of nicotine is mediated via the α7 subunits of nAChR.</p>

<title>NIC induces a Hippo-YAP/TAZ and notch signaling in ISCs</title>

<p>Next, to investigate the possible downstream signaling of α7-nAChR and PKC associated with NIC-induced renewal of ISCs, we explored PI3K/AKT signaling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>, p38/ mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>, and mTORC1 signaling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>, each of which plays a crucial role in the expansion of ISCs. Results indicate that NIC does not induce these cascades and these were not required for the effects of NIC on ISCs (Figures S3 A-D).</p>
<p>YAP/TAZ, the downstream effectors of the Hippo signaling pathway, and Notch receptor 1 (Notch1)/Delta-Like protein 1(Dll1) are the main components of Notch signaling; previously, these factors are reported to be upregulated in NIC-treated organoids<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>. Both the Hippo-YAP/TAZ and Notch signaling pathways regulate intestinal homeostasis via the control of ISC function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup> and Notch signaling is positively regulated by YAP/TAZ in the intestine<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>. Hence, we examined Hippo-YAP/TAZ and Notch signaling. YAP1 and TAZ expression was significantly induced in the crypts of NIC-treated mice (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>). <italic>YAP1</italic> and <italic>TAZ</italic> also upregulated at mRNA level in ISCs from NIC mice (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>). The expression of genes, including <italic>Jagged1</italic>, <italic>HeyL, Hes1, Hes5,</italic> and <italic>Dll1</italic>, involved in Notch signaling, significantly increased in ISCs obtained from NIC-treated mice (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>). Notably, Hippo-YAP/TAZ and Notch signaling were not significantly activated in Paneth cells, indicating that NIC affects α7-nAchR of ISCs rather than Paneth cells. Furthermore, activation of Notch signaling in crypts of NIC-treated mice was confirmed through immunoblotting assay (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>).</p>
<p>In the intestine, YAP activation enhances the expression of both β-catenin and transcriptional targets of Wnt signaling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>. Moreover, Notch signaling concomitantly regulates intestinal cell proliferation via Wnt signaling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>. Similarly, the expression of target proteins (Sox9, TCF4 and, C-myc) of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway as well as cell-cycle regulatory proteins, such as cyclin B, and cyclin E, was up-regulated in crypts obtained from NIC-treated mice (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>).</p>
<p>Collectively, these results suggest that NIC induces a Hippo-YAP/TAZ and Notch signal pathway in ISCs via activation of α7-nAchR and PKC, leading to the activation of Wnt signaling.</p>

<title>Inactivation of Hippo-YAP/TAZ and Notch signaling suppresses the NIC-induced colony formation</title>
<p>To further explore the role of the Hippo-YAP/TAZ and Notch signaling in NIC-induced ISC expansion, ISCs were cultured with NIC in the presence of either K-975, a specific inhibitor of transcriptional enhanced associate domain (TEAD), which binds to its transcriptional co-activators YAP or TAZ and forms a transcription complex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>, or γ-secretase inhibitor MK-0752 that inhibits the cleavage of Notch into its active signaling effector, Notch intracellular domain (NICD)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>. Treatment with K-975 and MK-0752 completely abolished the NIC-induced increased organoid formation (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5A</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">B</xref>). Furthermore, K-975 or MK-0752 prevented the increase in the organoid formation in ISCs treated with PNU 298987 or Ingenol-3-angelate (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5C-F</xref>), suggesting that YAP/Notch signaling acts downstream of α7-nAchR or PKC leading to the response of ISC to NIC (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5G</xref>).</p>

<title>DBZ treatment suppresses the expansion of ISCs by NIC in vivo</title>
<p>The significance of Notch signaling in the ISC expansion was validated in vivo. NIC-treated mice were subjected to daily IP injection of γ-secretase inhibitor DBZ (1 mg/kg body weight) for 2 weeks (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>). We confirmed that DBZ treatment significantly downregulated Hes5 protein expression in the crypts of NIC-treated mice (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>).

<p>Ki67 labeling and immunostaining for the ISC marker Olfm4 elucidated the effect of DBZ treatment on the frequency of ISCs in control and NIC-treated mice. DBZ treatment did not alter the population of ISCs in the control mice but significantly suppressed the expansion of Ki67+ and Olfm4+ cells in NIC-treated mice (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figures 6C and D</xref>). Moreover, DBZ suppressed the expansion of Ki67+ cells and CSCs in the colon of NIC-treated mice (Figures S4A and B). These outcomes demonstrate that the Hippo-YAP/TAZ and Notch signaling pathways are crucial for ISC expansion in NIC-treated mice analyzed in vivo.</p>

<title>DBZ inhibits intestinal tumor growth by NIC</title>

<p>To test whether NIC promotes tumor formation via ISC expansion, tumor formation was induced in NIC-treated <italic>Lgr5Cre<sup>ER</sup> Apc<sup>fl/f</sup></italic> (NIC-<italic>Lgr5Cre<sup>ER</sup> Apc<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic>) mice, and entire intestines, isolated from them, were examined for polyps (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our data propose a model in which NIC enhances the self-renewal of ISCs via activated Hippo-YAP/TAZ and Notch signaling (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure. 5G</xref>). Our analyses revealed an increase in the number of ISCs in NIC-treated mice. In contrast to ISCs, Paneth cells showed no increase in cell numbers in NIC-treated mice. Similarly, we assessed the functional ability of ISCs and Paneth cells in terms of ex vivo organoid formation, which indicated a NIC-induced gain-of-function in ISCs but not in Paneth cells. Hence, we propose that the stem cells are not dependent on Paneth cells in functional assays. Furthermore, we traced the signaling pathway in ISCs and detected that ISCs respond to NIC via α7-nAchR, PKC activation, and stimulation of Hippo-YAP/TAZ and Notch signaling with consequent Wnt/β-catenin activation (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure. 5G</xref>). Consistent with this model, DBZ treatment inhibited Hippo-YAP/TAZ and Notch signaling in mice and prevented NIC-induced ISC expansion and transformation through Apc loss.</p>
<p>Treatment of organoids with NIC has been reported to enhance cell growth and expression of marker genes of stem cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>. Moreover, mRNA analysis of NIC-treated organoids showed that the expression of <italic>YAP1/TAZ</italic> and <italic>Notch1/Dll1</italic> was upregulated after treatment with NIC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>. Although Hippo and Notch signaling pathways are putative targets for nAChR signaling, our model predicted that NIC activates the Hippo and Notch signaling pathway in Paneth cells rather than ISCs, because the α2β4-nAChR mainly expressed in Paneth cells. The mRNA analyses of sorted ISCs or Paneth cells and ex vivo functional assays were not reported previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>, our analysis validates that NIC affects ISC rather than Panth cells via Hippo-YAP/TAZ and Notch signaling activated though nAchRa7.</p>
<p>The crosstalk between Hippo, Notch, and Wnt signaling regulates mammalian intestinal homeostasis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>. Activated YAP/TAZ, which act downstream of Hippo signaling, translocate to the nucleus and induce the gene expression of Notch receptors and Notch ligands, and thus, Notch signaling and YAP1-induced ISC expansion are regulated in the intestine<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>. Moreover, YAP/TAZ and Notch signaling congruently induces nuclear translocation of YAP/TAZ and NICD, regulating the expression of common target genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>. YAP with TEADs enhances Jagged1-Notch1 signaling in breast cancer cells; Notch1 has been reported to promote YAP stability through inhibited β-TrCP-mediated degradation and formation of a YAP1-jagged-1/Notch1 positive feedback loop in breast cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>. Similarly, we propose a YAP/TAZ-Notch positive feedback loop in ISCs of NIC-treated mice. This model is consistent with DBZ-induced suppression of Hippo-YAP/TAZ and Notch signaling in ISCs obtained from NIC-treated mice. As NIC effectively expands the ISC population through the upregulated α7-nAChR and the formation of the YAP/TAZ-Notch loop, we speculate these factors to be good therapeutic targets for treating NIC-induced colon cancer.</p>
<p>Our study demonstrated that NIC increased the expression of YAP/TAZ and Notch target genes, as well as the ISC population. Our ex vivo organoid assay revealed the role of Hippo-YAP/TAZ and Notch signaling in NIC-induced ISC expansion. However, the mechanism underlying NIC-activated Hippo-YAP/TAZ and Notch signaling remains unclear. NIC administration can induce the nuclear translocation and activation of YAP in Esophageal Squamous Cell Cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>. The nAChRs physically interact with YAP, leading to the upregulation and nuclear translocation of YAP1. This process is considered to be mediated by PKC activation because PKC-specific inhibitors block NIC-induced YAP activation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>. Moreover, PKC activity induces the translocation of ADAM-10, which is implicated in the cleavage of Notch receptors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>, to the cell membrane of glioblastoma<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>. Hence, we propose the possibility of NIC-induced activation of YAP and ADAM via PKC, leading to Hippo-YAP/TAZ and Notch activation and ISC expansion.</p>
<p>The lifetime risk of various cancers is strongly correlated with frequency of stem cell divisions that maintain tissue homeostasis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>. However, the risk of cancer associated with stem cell divisions is heavily influenced by both extrinsic and intrinsic factors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>. Extrinsic factors, such as NIC, may increase the risk of cancer by promoting stem cell division. Our data indicated that NIC increased the abundance and proliferation of ISCs, which may partly explain the increased rate of intestinal tumors in smokers.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we demonstrated that NIC enhances the ISC population via α7-nAChR as well as Hippo-YAP/TAZ and Notch signaling. These findings revealed the pivotal role of NIC as a stimulant of the cancer stem cell proliferation in intestinal tumors, and thus, explains colon cancer development in cigarette smokers. The development of drugs that can block the α7-nAChR, Hippo-YAP/TAZ, and Notch signaling may provide a new therapeutic strategy for treating colon cancers.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In their manuscript, &quot;Nicotine enhances the stemness and tumorigenicity in intestinal stem cells via Hippo-YAP/TAZ and Notch signal pathway&quot;, authors Isotani et al claimed that this study identifies a NIC-triggered pathway regulating the stemness and tumorigenicity of ISCs and suggest the use of DBZ as a potential therapeutic strategy for treating intestinal tumors. However, the presented data do not support the primary claims.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>My main reservation is that the quality of the results presented in the manuscript may not fully substantiate their conclusions. For instance, in Figure 2 A and B, it is challenging to discern a healthy organoid. This is significant, as the entirety of Figure 2 and several panels in Figures 3 - 5 are based on these organoid assays. Additionally, there seems to be a discrepancy in the quality of results from the western blot, as the lanes of actin do not align with other proteins (Figure 6B).</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The manuscript by Isotani et al characterizes the hyperproliferation of intestinal stem cells (ISCs) induced by nicotine treatment in vivo. Employing a range of small molecule inhibitors, the authors systematically investigated potential receptors and downstream pathways associated with nicotine-induced phenotypes through in vitro organoid experiments. Notably, the study specifically highlights a signaling cascade involving α7-nAChR/PKC/YAP/TAZ/Notch as a key driver of nicotine-induced stem cell hyperproliferation. Utilizing a Lgr5CreER Apcfl/fl mouse model, the authors extend their findings to propose a potential role of nicotine in stem cell tumorgenesis. The study posits that Notch signaling is essential during this process.</p>
<p>Strengths and Weaknesses:</p>
<p>One noteworthy research highlight in this study is the indication, as shown in Figure 2 and S2, that the trophic effect of nicotine on ISC expansion is independent of Paneth cells. In the Discussion section, the authors propose that this independence may be attributed to distinct expression patterns of nAChRs in different cell types. To further substantiate these findings, it is suggested that the authors perform tissue staining of various nAChRs in the small intestine and colon. This additional analysis would provide more conclusive evidence regarding how stem cells uniquely respond to nicotine. It is also recommended to present the staining of α7-nAChR from different intestinal regions. This will provide insights into the primary target sites of nicotine in the gut tract. Additionally, it is recommended that the authors consider rephrasing the conclusion in this section (lines 123-124). The current statement implies that nicotine does not affect Paneth cells, which may be inaccurate based on the suggestion in line 275 that nicotine might influence Paneth cells through α2β4-nAChR. Providing a more nuanced conclusion would better reflect the complexity of nicotine's potential impact on Paneth cells.</p>
<p>As shown in the same result section, the effect of nicotine on ISC organoid formation appears to be independent of CHIR99021, a Wnt activator. Despite this, the authors suggest a potential involvement of Wnt/β-catenin activation downstream of nicotine in Figure 4F. In the Lgr5CreER Apcfl/fl mouse model, it is known that APC loss results in a constitutive stabilization of β-catenin, thus the hyperproliferation of ISCs by nicotine treatment in this mouse model is likely beyond Wnt activation. Therefore, it is recommended that the authors reconsider the inclusion of Wnt/β-catenin as a crucial signaling pathway downstream of nicotine, given the experimental evidence provided in this study.</p>
<p>In Figure 4, the authors investigate ISC organoid formation with a pan-PKC inhibitor, revealing that PKC inhibition blocks nicotine-induced ISC expansion. It's noteworthy that PKC inhibitors have historically been used successfully to isolate and maintain stem cells by promoting self-renewal. Therefore, it is surprising to observe no effect or reversal effect on ISCs in this context. A previous study demonstrated that the loss of PKCζ leads to increased ISC activity both in vivo and in vitro (DOI: 10.1016/j.celrep.2015.01.007). Additionally, to strengthen this aspect of the study, it would be beneficial for the authors to present more evidence, possibly using different PKC inhibitors, to reproduce the observed results with Gö 6983. This could help address potential concerns or discrepancies and contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of the role of PKC in nicotine-induced ISC expansion.</p>
<p>An additional avenue that could enhance the clinical relevance of the study is the exploration of human datasets. Specifically, leveraging scRNA-seq datasets of the human intestinal epithelium (DOI: 10.1038/s41586-021-03852-1) could provide valuable insights. Analyzing the expression patterns of nAChRs across diverse regions and cell types in the human intestine may offer a potential clinical implication.</p>
<p>In summary, the results generally support the authors' conclusions that nicotine directly influences ISC growth, potentially contributing to tumorgenesis. The identification of the α7-nAChR/PKC/YAP/TAZ/Notch pathway adds significant mechanistic insight. However, certain aspects of the experimental evidence, such as the receptor expression pattern, PKC inhibition response, and the involvement of Wnt/β-catenin activation, may require further clarification and exploration, especially considering previous literature suggesting potential discrepancies.</p>
