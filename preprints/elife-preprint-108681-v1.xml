<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Metabolism is a fundamental physiological process responsible for coordinating energy production and substrate utilization in response to changing physiological demands. This process is dynamically regulated by behavioral states, such as sleep and wakefulness, as well as directly by internal circadian clocks that align physiology with the external environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>]. Disruptions in these temporal processes are strongly associated with metabolic disorders, including obesity and type 2 diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>] as well as other metabolic diseases such as cardiovascular dysfunction and cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>].</p>
<p>With conserved and well-characterized sleep and circadian mechanisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>], as well as metabolic pathways also found in mammals, <italic>Drosophila</italic> offers a genetically tractable model for dissecting interactions between these different systems. In particular, sleep mutants with robust phenotypes can be employed to determine how loss of sleep impacts metabolic parameters, including rhythms of metabolic activity. At the same time, additional tools are now available for metabolic measurements previously not possible. Multiple approaches can be combined for a comprehensive understanding of metabolism under precisely controlled environmental conditions and at high temporal resolution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>].</p>
<p>Indirect calorimetry is a non-invasive form of respirometry that enables real-time quantification of whole-organism metabolic rate by measuring oxygen consumption (VO₂) and carbon dioxide production (VCO₂)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>]. These measurements allow for the estimation of energy expenditure and respiratory quotient (RQ), providing insights into substrate preference (carbohydrate vs. lipid use) and metabolic flexibility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>]. Although widely applied in mammalian systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>], indirect calorimetry in small model organisms such as <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> has only recently become feasible with advances in high-resolution, small-volume flow-through systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>]. This is a critical advancement, as dissecting time-of-day-dependent metabolic regulation in mammals is often confounded by overlapping effects of sleep, activity, and feeding rhythms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>]. While this can also be true in flies, the genetic tools available allow distinction between these processes to a greater extent.</p>
<p>This study focuses on wild-type isogenic control flies alongside three genetically characterized mutants: two short-sleep mutants: <italic>fumin</italic> (<italic>fmn</italic>), which displays impaired dopamine transporter function and defective dopamine reuptake [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>] and <italic>sleepless</italic> (<italic>sss</italic>), which lacks the Sleepless protein, resulting in altered membrane excitability and reduced GABA signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>]; and the circadian mutant <italic>period<sup>01</sup></italic> (<italic>per<sup>01</sup></italic>), which lacks a functional molecular clock [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>]. To investigate how sleep and circadian disruption independently and interactively influence metabolic regulation, we utilized a small-animal respirometry platform built on the MAVEn-FT system, coupled with a Licor 7000 CO₂ analyzer and an Oxzilla differential O₂ analyzer. This system builds upon the Sleep and Activity Metabolic Monitor (SAMM), which first demonstrated the feasibility of simultaneous CO₂ and O₂ measurements in <italic>Drosophila</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>]. This MAVEn-based platform enhances temporal resolution and throughput, enabling continuous measurement of respiratory parameters across multiple groups of flies over circadian time, and allowing fine-scale profiling of metabolic rhythms and their disruption across sleep-wake cycles.</p>
<p>To provide a more comprehensive perspective on metabolic regulation, we complemented respiratory measurements with steady-state metabolomic profiling using liquid chromatography- mass spectrometry (LC-MS) previously published from our group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>]. This integrative approach enables the identification of metabolite-level changes associated with altered energy expenditure and RQ, providing detailed insights into how sleep and circadian mutations influence metabolic homeostasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>]. By employing this framework, we sought to uncover conserved mechanisms linking temporal biological processes, such as sleep and circadian rhythms, to metabolic homeostasis and to elucidate how genetic and environmental perturbations in these systems influence energy balance and metabolic regulation.</p>

<title>Drosophila Strains, Entrainment and Collection</title>
<p><italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> isogenic control (iso), two short-sleep mutants, <italic>fumin</italic> (<italic>fmn</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>] and <italic>sleepless</italic> (<italic>sss</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>], as well as a circadian clock mutant (<italic>per<sup>01</sup></italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>] were used for this study. Male flies were collected shortly after eclosion and entrained in light-dark (LD) incubators for a minimum of three days before circadian collection. At the time of collection, flies were between five and seven days old. Wild-type (WT) isogenic control flies were either maintained under 12 hrs:12 hrs light versus dark conditions (WT-LD) or placed in constant darkness (WT-DD) for at least 24 hours prior to collection to examine light-independent rhythms. Mutant strains (<italic>fmn</italic>, <italic>sss</italic>, and <italic>per<sup>01</sup></italic>) were maintained under LD cycles. All flies were reared on a standard cornmeal/molasses medium at 25°C. Zeitgeber time (ZT) 0 was designated as lights-on, with lights-off occurring at ZT12 (12/12 LD).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2b">
<title>Respirometry Setup</title>
<p>All experiments were performed using groups of 25 flies per chamber. To account for genotype- specific differences in body size, each group of 25 flies (WT, <italic>fmn</italic>, <italic>sss</italic>, and <italic>per<sup>01</sup></italic>) was weighed prior to respirometry, and these weights were used to normalize VCO₂ and VO₂ values for accurate comparison. Each chamber was provisioned with 2 mL of fly food (2% agar, 5% sucrose) to sustain the flies during the 24-hour continuous recording period. Control chambers containing only food, without flies, were included to account for background microbial metabolism. To simulate natural microbial inoculation, flies were briefly introduced into these control chambers and then removed before data acquisition began.</p>
<p>The respirometry system continuously measured CO₂ production and O₂ consumption using a flow-through MAVEn system. It consisted of five main components: (1) a zero-grade air source and scrubbing column to remove residual CO₂, (2) mass-flow controllers to regulate airflow, (3) Sable Systems RC chambers to house the flies, (4) the MAVEn system to direct air sequentially from each chamber, and (5) gas analyzers for measuring CO₂ and O₂ concentrations. The system was calibrated every 3-5 trials using 100% N₂ (CO₂ = 0 ppm) and a known CO₂ standard to ensure measurement accuracy.</p>
<sec id="s2b1">
<title>Zero-Grade Air Supply and Scrubbing</title>
<p><underline>System</underline>: Zero-grade compressed air (&lt;0.1 ppm hydrocarbons) was first passed through a custom-built scrubbing column (#26800, Drierite) to remove residual CO₂. The column was packed with an inner layer of Ascarite (#81133–20–2, Acros Organics) flanked by two outer layers of Drierite (#7779–18–9, Drierite), separated by glass wool (#11–388, Fisher Scientific).</p>
<p>To re-humidify the air to ∼9 parts per thousand (ppt) water vapor content, it was then passed through Nafion tubing (#TT-070, Perma Pure, LLC) submerged in deionized water. Bev-A-line nonpermeable tubing (#56280, United States Plastic Corp.) was used to connect all system components.</p>
<p>Airflow Regulation: Re-humidified, CO₂-free air was split into two streams, each regulated by mass flow controllers to maintain a constant flow rate of 25 mL/min. One stream provided reference air to the CO₂ and O<sub>2</sub> analyzers (controlled by a Side-Trak 840 Series, Sierra Instruments, Inc. MFCV), while the second stream provided flow to the fly chambers (controlled by the MAVEn’s internal mass flow-controlled system).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2b2">
<title>Respirometry Chambers and MAVEn System’s Airflow Management</title>
<p>Flies were housed in Sable Systems RC chambers (70 mm × 20 mm borosilicate glass tubes), integrated into a continuous flow through MAVEn system. The MAVEn splits airflow into 16 channels for fly chambers and one dedicated baseline channel. Airflow is constantly and continuously maintained through all fly chambers while the MAVEn’s multiplexing system will switch the ‘active’ chamber’s airflow toward the analyzer chain for a preset dwell time of 120 seconds per chamber, and 60 seconds for baseline, with a baseline interleave ratio of 4 to ensure accuracy in O₂ measurement (i.e a baseline measurement after every four chambers). In this system the MAVEn manages air flow to allow for the sequential measurements of individual chamber gas parameters and air flow rates. Experimental respirometry recording were conducted for 24-hour periods. System control and data acquisition were handled via Sable Systems MAVEn Controller software.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2b3">
<title>CO₂ Production Measurement</title>
<p>Baseline CO₂ levels were recorded from the reference air prior to entering the chambers. As flies respired, the CO₂ released in each chamber was subsequently flushed to the CO₂ analyzer (Li-7000, LI-COR Biosciences) via the MAVEn system.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2b4">
<title>O₂ Consumption Measurement</title>
<p>Similarly, O<sub>2</sub> consumed by flies was measured immediately using the Oxzilla differential O<sub>2</sub> analyzer (Oxzilla II Oxygen Analyzer, Sable Systems International) placed downstream from the CO<sub>2</sub> analyzer in the analyzer chain. In this setup-controlled flow reference air exiting the CO<sub>2</sub> analyzer’s reference cell was routed into the Oxzilla’s reference channel, while animal air exiting the CO<sub>2</sub> analyzer’s sample cell was routed to the Oxzilla’s sample channel. To prevent dilution effects, water vapor was removed prior to O₂ analysis using small scrubbing columns.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2b5">
<title>Water Vapor Scrubbing Columns</title>
<p>Separate scrubbing columns were used for reference and animal airflows and placed in-line directly prior to the Oxzilla differential O<sub>2</sub> analyzer’s reference and sample channel inlet ports. Each column was made from a 10 mL syringe body (#14955459, Fisher Scientific) filled with an inner layer of Ascarite and two outer layers of magnesium perchlorate (M54, Fisher Scientific), separated by glass wool. Bev-A-line tubing was secured with rubber stoppers (#14–135E, Fisher Scientific). Columns were replaced twice during each 24-hour experiment to maintain performance.</p>

<title>Carbon Dioxide and Oxygen Analysis and Calculations</title>
<p>O₂ consumption was quantified by measuring the decrease in O₂ concentration as air passed through chambers containing flies. To ensure accuracy, a Savitzky-Golay filter (25-second window) was applied to smooth the raw signal, followed by a lag correction of 127 seconds accounted for delay between chamber exit and O<sub>2</sub> analyzer input. To match dry atmospheric air, the reference air was baseline corrected to 20.95% O₂. For both reference and animal air the %O<sub>2</sub> values were converted to O<sub>2</sub> fractional contents by dividing percentage values by 100 (thus baseline air has a fractional content of 0.2095). The VO₂ value from an empty chamber was subtracted from experimental values [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>]:

VO₂ values were expressed in μL/hr by summing all 5-minute bins into hourly averages.</p>
<p>CO<sub>2</sub> production was quantified by measuring the increase in CO₂ concentration as air passed through chambers containing flies. To ensure accuracy, a Savitzky-Golay filter (25-second window) was applied to smooth the raw signal, followed by a lag correction of 22 seconds with Z correction and 28 seconds without Z correction accounted for delay between chamber exit and O<sub>2</sub> analyzer input. To match dry atmospheric air, the reference air was baseline corrected to 0 parts per million (ppm) CO₂. For both reference and animal air the ppm CO<sub>2</sub> values were converted to CO<sub>2</sub> fractional contents by dividing percentage values by 1000000. The VCO₂ value from an empty chamber was subtracted from experimental values [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>]:

VCO₂ values were expressed in μL/hr by summing all 5-minute bins into hourly averages.</p>
<p>Respiratory quotient (RQ) was calculated as:</p>
<p>RQ= VCO<sub>2</sub> / VO<sub>2</sub>. This provided a ratio of CO₂ produced to O₂ consumed, reflecting macronutrient oxidation and metabolic flexibility.</p>

<title>Metabolite Extraction and LCMS Measurements</title>
<p>The metabolomics dataset analyzed in this study was previously published and is publicly available, as described in detail in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>]. Briefly, polar metabolites were extracted from fly bodies sampled every 2 hours from ZT0 to ZT22 using a modified Bligh-Dyer extraction method, as previously reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>]. The polar fraction of each extract was dried under vacuum and reconstituted in 100 μL of acetonitrile:Milli-Q water, followed by vortexing for 20 seconds.</p>
<p>Samples were analyzed using an ion-switching LC-MS method, and peak integration and data processing were performed according to previously published procedures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>].</p>

<sec id="s2e">
<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>All statistical analyses were conducted using GraphPad Prism. Non-parametric Spearman correlation was used to evaluate relationships among metabolic parameters. Metabolites with <italic>p</italic>- values below 0.05 were considered statistically significant and selected for further investigation. To assess genotype-specific differences, one-way ANOVA was performed followed by a pairwise unpaired two-tailed Student’s <italic>t</italic>-tests comparing the control group (WT-LD) with each genotype (<italic>fmn</italic>, <italic>sss</italic>, <italic>per<sup>01</sup></italic>, and WT-DD).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2f">
<title>Rhythmicity analysis</title>
<p>Rhythmicity analysis was performed using Nitecap, a tool for circadian and rhythmic analyses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>]. Time-series metabolic data were analyzed to compute rhythmic parameters using the RAIN algorithm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>]. Rhythms were assessed for statistical significance using false discovery rate (FDR)-adjusted p-values, ensuring robust detection while minimizing false positives. The lag parameters of each rhythm were computed using JTK cycle algorithm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>].</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2g">
<title>Pathway Analysis</title>
<p>Significant metabolites identified from univariate analyses were used for metabolic pathway analysis via MetaboAnalyst 5.0. Metabolites were uploaded using HMDB identifiers and analyzed using the hypergeometric enrichment method, with relative-betweenness centrality applied for topology analysis based on the <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> (KEGG) pathway library. Pathways with a p-value less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant.</p>

<title>Metabolic Fuel Utilization Across Genotypes Based on Respiratory Quotient (RQ)</title>
<p>To assess whole-body metabolic activity, we performed respirometry on groups of 25 flies per genotype, measuring oxygen consumption (VO₂) and carbon dioxide production (VCO₂) across the circadian cycle. The respiratory quotient (RQ), calculated as the ratio of VCO₂ to VO₂, provides insight into the predominant metabolic substrate being utilized: an RQ of 1.0 reflects pure carbohydrate metabolism, values below 1.0 indicate lipid and protein oxidation, and values above 1.0 suggest lipogenesis (the conversion of carbohydrates into fats) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>]. RQ, VCO₂, and VO₂ were continuously recorded from Zeitgeber Time (ZT) 0 to 24 at one-second intervals and subsequently averaged into 5-minute bins for analysis. <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1a-c</xref> shows the 5-minute binned VCO₂, VO₂ and RQ profiles across the circadian cycle for all genotypes (separate individual plots for VCO₂, VO₂, and RQ for each genotype are provided in the Figure S1a-e, S2a-e and S3a-e respectively).

<p>Among the genotypes tested, WT-LD, WT-DD, and <italic>per<sup>01</sup></italic>flies exhibited similarly elevated RQ values (1.20, 1.19, and 1.20, respectively), consistent with active lipogenesis. Group differences were assessed using the Kruskal–Wallis test, followed by Dunn’s multiple comparisons post hoc test revealed no statistically significant differences in RQ among these three genotypes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1f</xref>, <italic>ns</italic>), suggesting that circadian disruption in constant darkness or in the <italic>per<sup>01</sup></italic>mutant does not alter the dominant fuel utilization strategy under basal conditions.</p>
<p>In contrast, short-sleeping mutants displayed lower RQ values. The <italic>fmn</italic> mutant exhibited a moderate reduction (RQ = 1.09), reflecting increased reliance on carbohydrate metabolism. The <italic>sss</italic> mutant showed the lowest RQ (0.94), indicating a shift toward lipid and protein catabolism.

<p>These results demonstrate that while WT and circadian-disrupted genotypes maintain a lipogenic profile, sleep-deficient mutants exhibit altered substrate utilization, favoring catabolism of carbohydrates or lipids depending on the severity of sleep disruption.</p>
<p>Furthermore, to account for potential differences in body size that could confound VCO₂ and VO₂ measurements, fly weights were recorded for each genotype before respirometry.

These data confirm that the observed metabolic differences are not attributable to body size but reflect inherent alterations in metabolic fuel utilization.</p>

Several metabolites demonstrated strong correlations with RQ (|ρ| &gt; 0.7, p &lt; 0.05), suggesting tight coupling between metabolic fluctuations and respiratory output.

<p>To further characterize these associations, metabolites were categorized based on the timing of their peak changes relative to RQ fluctuations, exhibiting either positive or negative lag. To enable direct comparison of temporal dynamics between RQ and metabolite profiles across ZT 0 to ZT 24, z-scoring was performed to normalize differences in absolute magnitude and measurement units. Within this framework, a positive lag indicates that metabolite changes occur after shifts in RQ, requiring the metabolite profile to be shifted forward (rightward) along the time axis for optimal alignment. Conversely, a negative lag signifies that metabolite changes precede RQ fluctuations, necessitating a backward (leftward) shift of the metabolite profile to achieve alignment (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5b</xref>).</p>

By comparing wild-type flies with mutants affecting sleep (<italic>fumin</italic> and <italic>sleepless</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>] and circadian clock function (<italic>per<sup>01</sup></italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>], we have captured genotype-specific differences in respiratory dynamics and substrate usage across the circadian cycle under tightly controlled environmental conditions. These findings establish a functional framework for understanding how behavioral state and clock integrity shape metabolic homeostasis.</p>
<p>Our data suggest that sleep deprivation and circadian disruption drive distinct changes in whole- organism respiratory physiology and fuel selection. Metabolites in wild-type LD typically showed peak correlations preceding respiratory changes (negative lag), reflecting anticipatory circadian control. In contrast, mutants displayed a shift to reactive correlations (positive or zero lag), indicating loss of temporal synchronization and proactive metabolic adjustments. These phenotypes closely parallel metabolic outcomes reported in mammalian systems, where disruptions in behavioral states such as sleep deprivation or circadian misalignment are linked to increased energy expenditure, altered substrate utilization patterns, and systemic metabolic imbalance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>]. In both rodents and humans, sleep loss leads to elevated basal metabolic rate and a shift toward carbohydrate oxidation and lipid/protein catabolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>].

<p>Likewise, the dampened and phase-shifted respiratory rhythms observed in <italic>per<sup>01</sup></italic> and WT-DD flies resemble patterns seen in mammalian models of circadian misalignment, which exhibit blunted respiratory oscillations, disrupted glucose and lipid regulation, and increased risk for metabolic disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>].

<title>Wild-Type Flies Exhibit Circadian-Regulated Biosynthesis and Redox Balance Under LD Cycles</title>
<p>In wild-type flies maintained under a 12:12 light-dark (LD) cycle, RQ-correlated metabolites revealed tightly coordinated circadian regulation of biosynthetic and redox pathways. An increase in nicotinate and nicotinamide metabolism-highlighted by changes in quinolinate, nicotinamide riboside, and L-aspartic acid-suggests a direct link between mitochondrial respiration and NAD⁺ biosynthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>]. These NAD⁺ precursor changes occur before respiration increases (negative lag), highlighting anticipatory NAD⁺ regulation. Concurrent alterations in alanine, aspartate, and glutamate metabolism (via citric acid and carbamoyl phosphate) and arginine biosynthesis indicate dynamic alignment of amino acid turnover with energy demand and nitrogen disposal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>]. RQ-associated enrichment of citrate cycle intermediates such as malate and citric acid further supports circadian gating of oxidative phosphorylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>]. Elevated levels of D-glucose were mapped to the KEGG pathway for neomycin, kanamycin, and gentamicin biosynthesis. While <italic>Drosophila</italic> does not synthesize these antibiotics, the enrichment likely reflects the presence of shared carbohydrate intermediates (e.g., glucose, glucose-6-phosphate, UDP-glucose) common to multiple biosynthetic processes. This mapping is more indicative of altered carbohydrate and amino sugar metabolism, or potentially reflects microbial contributions, rather than actual antibiotic production by the host [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>]. Additional contributions from glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism reinforce the role of anaplerotic flux and redox cycling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>]. Notably, persistent correlations between RQ and pantothenate precursors suggest synchronized CoA biosynthesis, potentially coordinating fatty acid oxidation and TCA cycle input [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>]. Together, these results demonstrate that under LD conditions, wild-type flies sustain temporal coordination between respiration and mitochondrial metabolism, integrating redox homeostasis, nitrogen metabolism, and substrate availability in a circadian-dependent manner.</p>

<title>Altered Amino Acid Metabolism and Mitochondrial Dysregulation in fmn Mutants</title>
<p>The <italic>fumin</italic> (<italic>fmn</italic>) mutant, characterized by chronic sleep loss, exhibited genotype-specific disruptions in metabolic coordination, as revealed by metabolites whose temporal dynamics were strongly correlated with respiratory quotient (RQ). In <italic>fmn</italic> flies, significant RQ correlations (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) were identified in pathways including arginine biosynthesis (citrulline, glutamine), purine metabolism (inosine, glutamine), and nitrogen metabolism-suggesting a decoupling of amino acid turnover and nucleotide cycling from respiratory demand [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>]. Glutamine’s strong association with RQ highlights its central role in buffering nitrogen flux and supporting biosynthetic processes under energetic stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>]. Correlated dynamics of 2-hydroxyglutarate, a key intermediate in butanoate metabolism, point to impaired TCA cycle flux and redox imbalance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>]. Likewise, RQ-associated shifts in methylhistidine suggest altered histidine metabolism, potentially impacting mitochondrial protein turnover and methylation processes. Acylcarnitine metabolites, indicators of lipid oxidation, consistently emerged as strong correlates across all genotypes but particularly in <italic>fmn</italic>, underscoring lipid metabolism’s critical role in respiratory coupling. Particularly in mutants, increased reliance on fatty acid oxidation may reflect compensatory responses to disrupted carbohydrate metabolism and sustained energetic demands. Together, these findings indicate a failure in aligning substrate oxidation with mitochondrial respiratory output in <italic>fmn</italic> mutants. Building on prior evidence of mitochondrial stress in sleep-deprived <italic>fmn</italic> flies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>], our integrative respirometry-metabolomics analysis reveals disrupted coupling between energy metabolism and amino acid pathways, underscoring the physiological cost of chronic sleep loss on mitochondrial homeostasis.</p>

<title>Disrupted Carbon Metabolism and Mitochondrial Stress in sss Mutants</title>
<p>The <italic>sleepless</italic> (<italic>sss</italic>) mutant displayed significant disruptions in carbon and amino acid metabolism, as indicated by strong correlations between respiratory quotient (RQ) and metabolites involved in glycine, serine, and threonine metabolism (choline, dimethylglycine, glycine), butanoate metabolism (acetoacetate, succinate), and carbohydrate pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>]. Notably, RQ-associated shifts in choline and dimethylglycine suggest dysregulation of one-carbon metabolism and methyl group transfer, which can impair mitochondrial function and epigenetic stability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref>]. Correlated dynamics of acetoacetate, a ketone body often found in starvation, and succinate (both key intermediates of butanoate metabolism) point to altered TCA cycle input and mitochondrial redox imbalance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref>]. In parallel, strong RQ correlations with sucrose and D-glucose (from both starch/sucrose and galactose metabolism) indicate disrupted carbohydrate processing and inefficient substrate utilization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref>]. cAMP and biotin were also found to associate with respiration, both unique in metabolic regulation through altered neuromodulatory signaling and cofactor metabolism. These findings suggest that <italic>sss</italic> mutants exhibit altered metabolic routing in response to respiratory demand, shifting substrate utilization toward carbohydrate and amino acid pathways under sleep-deprived conditions, consistent with metabolic stress responses observed in other models of sleep loss [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref>].</p>

<title>Loss of Temporal Coupling of Mitochondrial Metabolism in Clock Mutants</title>
<p>In <italic>period</italic> (<italic>per<sup>01</sup></italic>) mutants lacking a functional circadian clock, the temporal coordination between metabolism and respiration was disrupted across nearly every measured metabolite through intermittent strong correlations with respiration, reflecting broad metabolic chaos [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref>]. Strong correlations with RQ were observed in alanine, aspartate, and glutamate metabolism (L-alanine, glutamine, fumarate, oxoglutarate) and arginine biosynthesis, suggesting inefficient routing of amino acid-derived substrates into mitochondrial energy production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>]. Delayed RQ-associated dynamics of glutamine, oxoglutarate, and fumarate indicate a mismatch between substrate availability and respiratory output [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>]. Additionally, metabolites from arginine and proline metabolism (creatine, spermidine, N-acetylputrescine, 4-hydroxyproline) exhibited altered RQ correlations, suggesting impaired mitochondrial redox buffering and compromised integrity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref>]. Perturbations in purine metabolism-including adenosine, deoxyadenosine monophosphate, xanthosine, and ADP-ribose-further point to dysregulated ATP turnover and nucleotide imbalance. Correlations with quinolinic acid and niacinamide reflect altered nicotinate and nicotinamide metabolism, implicating disrupted NAD⁺ biosynthesis and redox state [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>]. Additional RQ- associated changes in NADPH and TCA intermediates (fumarate, oxoglutarate) align with impaired glutathione metabolism and reduced mitochondrial capacity. Microbial-derived metabolites (trigonelline, phenylacetylglycine) were also identified in the correlation analysis, suggesting potential gut microbiome interactions that become evident in circadian disruption. Together, these findings suggest that the loss of circadian timing in <italic>per<sup>01</sup></italic> mutants lead to widespread uncoupling of substrate utilization and mitochondrial respiration.

<title>Metabolic Desynchrony and Redox Imbalance in Wild-Type Flies Under Constant Darkness</title>
<p>In wild-type flies maintained under constant darkness (DD), the absence of environmental light cues led to disrupted temporal alignment between mitochondrial respiration and metabolic pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref>]. Generally, we note a shift towards reactive metabolic adjustments (positive lags) compared to WT-LD instead of anticipatory preparation, indicating reduced metabolic efficiency. RQ-correlated metabolites showed significant enrichment in arginine biosynthesis (citrulline, ornithine, urea), glycine, serine, and threonine metabolism (L-cystathionine, phosphoserine, pyruvic acid), and cysteine and methionine metabolism-indicating altered integration of nitrogen and sulfur amino acid metabolism with respiratory activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>]. Notably, the convergence of pyruvic acid across multiple pathways suggests dysregulated entry points into the TCA cycle, while the consistent association of L-cystathionine highlights impaired redox buffering and methylation capacity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">73</xref>]. Altered correlations in arginine and proline metabolism (ornithine, pyruvic acid) further underscore compromised coupling between amino acid turnover and mitochondrial energy production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>]. Altered lipid metabolism and increased nitrogen catabolism are likely compensatory mechanisms in the absence of environmental cues.</p>
<p>These findings build on previous reports of circadian desynchrony by providing direct functional evidence that environmental light cues are essential for maintaining coherent coordination between respiration and key metabolic circuits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">74</xref>].

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>This study demonstrates that sleep loss and circadian disruption impair metabolic homeostasis in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> via distinct yet converging mechanisms. Wild-type flies under light-dark cycles (WT-LD) maintained coordinated anticipatory respiratory and metabolic rhythms, while sleep mutants (<italic>fmn</italic>, <italic>sss</italic>) and circadian-disrupted flies (<italic>per<sup>01</sup></italic>, WT-DD) showed altered substrate utilization, redox imbalance, and uncoupling of mitochondrial pathways, likely reactive to respiration. These findings highlight the essential role of both sleep and circadian timing in regulating energy metabolism. The presence of neuromodulatory metabolites (e.g., cAMP in <italic>sleepless</italic> mutants) and microbial-derived compounds (trigonelline, phenylacetylglycine in <italic>per<sup>01</sup></italic> mutants) points toward additional layers of metabolic regulation influenced by neuronal activity and gut microbiota interactions, revealing more complex metabolic dysregulation in sleep- deprived and circadian-disrupted states. By combining high-resolution respirometry with targeted metabolomics, we establish <italic>Drosophila</italic> as a powerful model for investigating the molecular basis of sleep- and clock-related metabolic dysfunction and potential therapeutic interventions.</p>

<p>This study investigates how sleep loss and circadian disruption affect whole-organ metabolism in flies (<italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>) and reports that wild-type flies align metabolism in anticipation of diurnal rhythm, while mutant flies with impaired sleep or circadian function shift to reactive or misaligned metabolism. The integration of chamber-based flow-through respirometry with LC-MS metabolomics is innovative, and the significance of the findings is <bold>valuable</bold>. However, the strength of evidence needed to support the conclusions is <bold>incomplete</bold> based on concerns regarding the inappropriate use of constant darkness to disrupt circadian rhythms and the lack of details justifying the methods used to correlate respirometry data with whole-body metabolomics.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This study by Akhtar et al. aims to investigate the link between systemic metabolism and respiratory demands, and how sleep and the circadian clock regulate metabolic states and respiratory dynamics. The authors leverage genetic mutants that are defective in sleep and circadian behavior in combination with indirect respirometry and steady-state LC-MS-based metabolomics to address this question in the Drosophila model.</p>
<p>First, the authors performed respirometry (on groups of 25 flies) to measure oxygen consumption (VO2) and carbon dioxide production (VCO2) to calculate the respiratory quotient (RQ) across the 24-hour day (12h:12h light-dark cycle) and assess metabolic fuel utilization. They observed that among all the genotypes tested, wild type (WT) flies and per0 flies in LD and WT flies in DD exhibit RQ &gt;1. They concluded the &gt;1 RQ is consistent with active lipogenesis. In contrast, the short-sleep mutants fumin (fmn) and sleepless (sss) showed significantly different RQ; the fmn exhibits a slight reduction in RQ values, suggesting increased reliance on carbohydrate metabolism, while sss exhibits even lower RQ (0.94), consistent with a shift toward lipid and protein catabolism.</p>
<p>The authors then proceeded to bin these measurements in 12-hour partitions, ZT0-12 and ZT12-24, to assess diurnal differences in average values of VO2, VCO2, and RQ. They observed significant day-night differences in metabolic rates in WT-LD flies, with higher rates during the day. The diurnal differences remain in the short-sleep mutants, but the overall metabolic rates are higher. WT-DD flies exhibit the lowest respiratory activity, although the day-night differences remain in free-running conditions. Finally, per01 mutants exhibit no significant change in day-night respiratory rates, suggesting that a functional circadian clock is necessary for diurnal differences in metabolic rates.</p>
<p>They then performed finer-resolution 24-hour rhythmic analysis (RAIN and JTK) to determine if VO2, VCO2, and RQ exhibit 24-hour rhythmic and if there are genotype-specific differences. Based on their criteria, VCO2 is rhythmic in all conditions tested, while VO2 is rhythmic in all conditions except in fmn-LD. Finally, RQ is rhythmic in all 3 mutants but not in WT-LD and WT-DD. Peak phases for the rhythms were deduced using JTK lag values.</p>
<p>The authors proceeded to leverage a previously published steady-state metabolite dataset to investigate the potential association of RQ with metabolite profiles. Spearman correlation was performed to identify metabolites that exhibit coupling to respiratory output. Positive and negative lag analysis were subsequently performed to further characterize these associations based on the timing of the metabolite peak changes relative to RQ fluctuations. The authors suggest that a positive lag indicates that metabolite changes occur after shifts in RQ, and a negative lag signifies that metabolite changes precede RQ changes. To visualize metabolic pathways that exhibit these temporal relationships, a clustered heatmap and enrichment analysis were performed. Through these analyses, they concluded that both sleep and circadian systems are essential for aligning metabolic substrate selection with energy demands, and different metabolic pathways are misregulated in the different mutants with sleep and circadian defects.</p>
<p>Strength:</p>
<p>The research questions this study explores are significant, given that metabolism and respiratory demand are central to animal biology. The experimental methods used, including the well-characterized fly genetic mutants, the newly developed method for indirect calorimetry measurements, and LC-MS-based metabolomics, are all appropriate. This study provides insights into the impact of sleep and circadian rhythm disruption on metabolism and respiratory demand and serves as a foundation for future mechanistic investigations.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>There are some conceptual flaws that the authors need to address regarding circadian biology, and some of the conclusions can be better supported by additional analysis to provide a stronger foundation for future functional investigation. At times, the methods, especially the statistical analysis, are not well articulated; they need to be better explained.</p>

<p>This is an innovative and technically strong study that integrates dual-gas respirometry with LC-MS metabolomics to examine how sleep and circadian disruption shape metabolism in Drosophila. The combination of continuous O₂/CO₂ measurements with high-temporal-resolution metabolite profiling is novel and provides fresh insight into how wild-type flies maintain anticipatory fuel alignment, while mutants shift to reactive or misaligned metabolism. The use of lag-shift correlation analysis is particularly clever, as it highlights temporal coordination rather than static associations. Together, the findings advance our understanding of how circadian clocks and sleep contribute to metabolic efficiency and redox balance.</p>
<p>However, there are several areas where the manuscript could be strengthened. The authors should acknowledge that their findings may be gene-specific. Because sleep deprivation was not performed, it remains uncertain whether the observed metabolic shifts generalize to sleep loss broadly or are restricted to the fmn and sss mutants. This concern also connects to the finding of metabolic misalignment under constant darkness despite an intact clock. The conclusion that external entrainment is essential for maintaining energy homeostasis in flies may not translate to mammals. It would help to reference supporting data for the finding and discuss differences across species. Ideally, complementary circadian (light-dark cycle disruption) or sleep deprivation (for several hours) experiments, or citation of comparable studies, would strengthen the generality of the findings. Figures 1-4 are straightforward and clear, but when the manuscript transitions to the metabolite-respiration correlations, there is little description of the metabolomics methods or datasets, which should be clarified. The Discussion is at times repetitive and could be tightened, with the main message (i.e., wild-type flies align metabolism in advance, while mutants do not) kept front and center. Terms such as &quot;anticipatory&quot; and &quot;reactive&quot; should be defined early and used consistently throughout.</p>
<p>Overall, this is a strong and novel contribution. With clarification of scope, refinement of presentation, and a more focused Discussion, the paper will make a significant impact.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors investigate how sleep loss and circadian disruption affect whole-organism metabolism in Drosophila melanogaster. They used chamber-based flow-through respirometry to measure oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide production in wild-type flies and in mutants with impaired sleep or circadian function. These measurements were then integrated with a previously published metabolomics dataset to explore how respiratory dynamics align with metabolic pathways. The central claim is that wild-type flies display anticipatory coordination of metabolic processes with circadian time, while mutants exhibit reactive shifts in substrate use, redox imbalance, and signs of mitochondrial stress.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The study has several strengths. Continuous high-resolution respirometry in flies is challenging, and its application across multiple genotypes provides good comparative insight. The conceptual framework distinguishing anticipatory from reactive metabolic regulation is interesting. The translational framing helps place the work in a broader context of sleep, circadian biology, and metabolic health.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>At the same time, the evidence supporting the conclusions is somewhat limited. The metabolomics data were not newly generated but repurposed from prior work, reducing novelty. The biological replication in the respirometry assays is low, with only a small number of chambers per genotype. Importantly, respiratory parameters in flies are strongly influenced by locomotor activity, yet no direct measurements of activity were included, making it difficult to separate intrinsic metabolic changes from behavioral differences in mutants. In addition, repeated claims of &quot;mitochondrial stress&quot; are not directly substantiated by assays of mitochondrial function. The study also excluded female flies entirely, despite well-documented sex differences in metabolism, which narrows the generality of the findings.</p>

<p>We thank the reviewers for their thoughtful public feedback. Our revision will clarify scope and methods/statistics, as well as streamline the narrative so the central message is clear: wild-type flies exhibit anticipatory alignment of fuel selection with circadian time, whereas short-sleep and clock mutants show reactive or misaligned metabolism under our conditions.</p>
<p>Major conceptual and experimental revisions:</p>
<p>(1) We will define “anticipatory” (clock-aligned, pre-emptive substrate choice) and “reactive” (post-hoc substrate shifts) up front and use these terms consistently. We will clearly distinguish diurnal (LD) from circadian (DD) regulation and avoid implying that DD abolishes rhythmicity. Claims will be limited to the tested genotypes (<italic>fmn, sss, and per<sup>01</sup></italic>) without generalizing to all forms of sleep loss or to mammals (although we will speculate in the discussion about translation and generalizability). We will temper language around external entrainment in DD to “contributes strongly under our conditions in flies.”</p>
<p>(2) We will expand the respirometry and rhythmicity sections (RAIN/JTK parameters, period/phase outputs, multiple-testing control). We will clarify that each measurement is an average of 300 flies per genotype (25 flies/chamber, 4 chambers/experiment, 3 experimental days) and specify the chamber as the experimental unit with n and error structure in each figure legend. For metabolomics–respirometry correlations, we will briefly describe dataset parameters, time-matching across ZT, normalization, Spearman correlations, and lag interpretation.</p>
<p>(3) We are performing additional experimental measurements through tissue respirometry of gut tissues and ROS staining to support our claims of “mitochondrial stress” in the short sleeping mutants. We note that this has already been shown for <italic>fmn</italic> in Vaccaro et al (Cell, 2020) and we will extend this to the other mutants studied in our work.</p>
<p>Reviewer-specific points</p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #1.</bold></p>
<p>We will clarify the circadian/diurnal framing, fully report rhythmicity analyses (parameters, n, q-values, phases), and better explain the metabolomics-respiration coupling with a concise workflow figure and supplementary table. The conclusion that sleep and clock systems align substrate selection with energy demand will be presented as supported under our tested conditions and positioned as groundwork for future mechanistic studies.</p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #2.</bold></p>
<p>We will state explicitly that findings may be gene-specific and avoid inferring generality to all sleep loss. We will soften cross-species language about external entrainment and add a brief note on species differences. For behavioral context (activity/feeding/sleep in <italic>fmn andsss</italic>), we will cite our related manuscript in revision (Malik et al, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.10.30.564837v2">https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.10.30.564837v2</ext-link>) in which we have measured both activity and feeding for <italic>fmn</italic>, <italic>sss</italic>, and wt flies. We will add a concise description of LC-MS processing and pathway analysis and define “anticipatory”/“reactive” early, using them consistently.</p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #3.</bold></p>
<p>We acknowledge that metabolomics were repurposed and emphasize the novelty of integrating continuous VCO2 and VO2 respirometry with temporal lag analysis. We will report replication clearly (chambers as the unit, n per genotype) and acknowledge locomotor activity as a potential confound, pointing to the related manuscript (Malik et al) for independent activity/feeding measurements and experimental measures of mitochondrial stress as outlined above. We will also further note that only males were studied, outlining this as a limitation and a future direction.</p>
