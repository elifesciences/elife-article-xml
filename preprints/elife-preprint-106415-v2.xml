<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Spacing of Ranvier nodes along myelinated axons is a critical determinant of conduction velocity, influencing spike arrival timing and hence neural circuit function. In the chick brainstem auditory circuit, the pattern of nodal spacing varies regionally along single axons, enabling precise binaural integration for sound localization. Using this model, we investigated the potential factors underlying the biased nodal spacing pattern. 3D morphometry revealed that these axons were almost fully myelinated by oligodendrocytes exhibiting distinct morphologies and cell densities across regions after hearing onset. The structure of axons did not affect internodal length. Inhibiting vesicular release from the axons did not affect internodal length or oligodendrocyte morphology, but caused unmyelinated segments on the axons by suppressing oligodendrogenesis near the presynaptic terminals. These results suggest that the regional heterogeneity in the intrinsic properties of oligodendrocytes is a prominent determinant of the biased nodal spacing pattern in the sound localization circuit, while activity-dependent signaling supports the pattern by ensuring adequate oligodendrocyte density. Our findings highlight the importance of oligodendrocyte heterogeneity in fine-tuning neural circuit function.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Ranvier nodes are highly excitable domains distributed along myelinated axons and contribute to increase conduction velocity through saltatory conduction. The distance between adjacent nodes (internodal length) affects the speed of saltatory conduction, with longer internodes leading to faster conduction, and hence has a significant impact on neural circuit function by influencing the timing of input arrival at target neurons. The pattern of nodal spacing along axons is not necessarily uniform. Recent studies have shown that the internodal length varies not only among axonal types and brain regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Chong et al., 2012</xref>), but also along individual axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Tomassy et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Ford et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bonetto et al., 2021</xref>). Despite its potential importance in neural information processing, the mechanisms regulating nodal spacing patterns are not well understood (Normand and Rasband, 2016).</p>
<p>Various factors could contribute to the emergence of nodal spacing patterns along axons. In the central nervous system (CNS), each Ranvier node is formed through the following processes. Immature oligodendrocytes contact axons with their processes, initiating myelin formation that extends along the axon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Snaidero et al., 2014</xref>). At the ends of the extending myelin, the paranodal domain, at which the myelin tip contacts the axon, acts as a diffusion barrier and facilitates the clustering of voltage-gated sodium channels (Nav) and the scaffolding protein ankyrinG (AnkG) to form a heminode. Subsequent restriction of the gap between two neighboring heminodes forms a mature Ranvier node (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Vabnick et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Susuki et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Rasband and Peles, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">2021</xref>). Thus, the patterning of nodal spacing along axons is based on multicellular interactions among oligodendrocytes and axons and could be influenced by multiple factors associated with these cells, the factors related to oligodendrocytes include their morphological characteristics (e.g., the number and length of myelin sheaths) and cell density relative to axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Chong et al., 2012</xref>), while those related to axons include their branching (Stedehouder et al., 2019), diameter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Bechler et al., 2015</xref>), and neural activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Fields, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bechler et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bonetto et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Osanai et al., 2022</xref>). In addition, the contributions of these factors would vary significantly due to the diversity of both cell types and developmental stages, which obscures our understanding of the mechanisms of determining the nodal spacing patterns.</p>
<p>To understand the regulatory mechanisms of nodal spacing, the chicken brainstem auditory circuit is an excellent model, because the nodal spacing is biased in a region-dependent manner along the same projecting axons, minimizing the effects of neuronal diversity. In addition, this regional difference in internodal length is also important in the computation of neural circuits for sound localization. Sound localization is the ability to identify the direction of sound source and involves detecting the time difference in sound arrivals between the ears (interaural time difference, ITD) in the order of microseconds. The ITD detection is mediated by an array of coincidence detector neurons in the nucleus laminaris (NL) that receive excitatory synaptic inputs from both sides of the nucleus magnocellularis (NM), a homologue of mammalian anteroventral cochlear nucleus (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Carr and Konishi, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Hyson 2005</xref>). In this circuit, the spacing of nodes along the axon of NM neurons differs among regions; the internodal length is longer at the tract region across the midline than at other regions including the NL (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Seidl et al., 2010</xref>). The long internodes reduce the conduction time from the contralateral side and compensate for the difference in axonal pathlengths between the two sides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Seidl et al., 2014</xref>), while the short internodes expand the dynamic range for detectable ITD within the NL. Therefore, this model will be an important stepping stone for elucidating the regulatory mechanisms of nodal spacing and their impact on neural circuit function.</p>

<p>In this study, we tested the potential factors contributing to the regional differences in the nodal spacing along NM axons using high-resolution 3D morphometry of the optically-cleared brainstem auditory circuit. The results showed that NM axons are almost fully myelinated by oligodendrocytes with distinct morphological features after hearing onset. This morphological difference was not due to axonal structure. Inhibition of vesicular release from NM axons did not affect the internodal length and oligodendrocyte morphology but caused unmyelinated segments on NM axons via a suppression of oligodendrogenesis at the NL region. These results identified that the major factor contributing to the biased nodal spacing pattern in the ITD circuit is the regional heterogeneity in the intrinsic properties of oligodendrocytes. Activity-dependent signaling also contributed to this circuit by ensuring the density of oligodendrocytes through enhanced oligodendrogenesis. Our findings provide new insights into the mechanism of regulating nodal spacing along single axons and also into the significance of oligodendrocyte heterogeneity in neural circuit function.</p>

<title>Ranvier nodes developed in a similar time course along NM axons after hearing onset</title>
<p>NM neurons in chick embryos form axonal projections to the NL at embryonic day 10 (E10), begin to receive auditory input from around E12, and are functionally mature by the time around hatch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Akter et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2020</xref>) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>), allowing the animals to localize sounds immediately after hatching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Grier et al., 1967</xref>). To clarify how node formation progresses along development and whether there are regional differences in the timing of node formation, we examined the development of nodes at the tract and NL regions by double staining with AnkG and pan Nav antibodies or AnkG and Caspr antibodies, a marker for the paranodal domain (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1DâF</xref>).</p>
<p>At E12, we did not find these molecules at each region. At E15, Nav-positive clusters appeared and they were localized specifically at one end of the fibrous AnkG signals. The remaining Nav-negative part of AnkG signals would correspond to the paranodal domain, as myelin sheath at the domain shows transient expression of AnkG during the immature period of CNS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Chang et al., 2014</xref>), and these structures were defined as âheminodeâ. At E18, Caspr signals became detectable at the paranodal domain of heminode. In addition, some Caspr signals appeared on both sides of the fibrous AnkG signals, sandwiching the Nav cluster. These structures would be formed through the fusion of adjacent heminodes and were defined as âimmature nodeâ. At E21, many nodes showed mature patterns, with complete colocalization of Nav and AnkG at a short nodal domain, which was flanked by Caspr-positive paranodal domains (âmature nodeâ). Triple staining of these molecules confirmed the three stages of nodal development along the axon of NM neurons. Quantification of their abundance revealed that their maturation progressed gradually after hearing onset and was almost completed around hatch. 90 % of the node types were heminodes at E15. This decreased to about 50% by E18 and to about 10% by E21 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G, H</xref>), suggesting that NM axons are almost fully myelinated by E21. Although the increase in the proportion of immature nodes was slightly preceded at the tract region, the overall tendency did not differ greatly between the regions. These data indicate that the formation of Ranvier nodes progress in a similar time course along the axon.</p>

<title>Development of myelin sheath along NM axons</title>
<p>Formation of Ranvier nodes requires maturation of myelin sheaths. To clarify their relationship on NM axons, we also examined the development of myelin with an antibody against myelin associated glycoprotein (MAG) during the period of node formation.</p>
<p>The immunosignals for MAG appeared around the midline of the brainstem at E12 and extended along the axons of NM neurons at E15, becoming more intense at later ages for both tract and NL regions (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A, B</xref>). These are consistent with the time course of node formation. Importantly, many oligodendrocytes were situated along the axon, as identified by immunopositivity of Olig2, a marker in the nucleus of oligodendrocyte lineage cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>). In addition, the MAG signals overlapped with the heminodes at E15. (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>), indicating that myelin sheaths already exist around the paranodal domains at the very early stage of node formation, in agreement with the idea that the early nodes can shift their position dynamically with myelin maturation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>). These raised the questions as to when the biased nodal spacing pattern emerges during development and whether and how oligodendrocytes contribute to the process.</p>

<title>Internodal length was determined roughly during node formation</title>
<p>To answer these questions, we first evaluated the internodal length between mature/immature nodes at E18 and P9 at the tract and NL regions. These two time points correspond to the periods during and after node formation, respectively. We labeled axons with a tracer, rhodamine dextran, visualized nodes with the Caspr antibody, and measured the internodal length at each region (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>).</p>
<p>The internodal length was about 3 times longer in the tract region compared with the NL region at P9 (tract: 211.1Â±9.6 Î¼m; NL: 63.9Â±3.0 Î¼m) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2G</xref>), as observed in posthatch animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Seidl et al., 2010</xref>). The difference in internodal length in these two regions of the axons was already evident at E18, although the internodal length was shorter by 20% at E18 in both tract and NL regions (tract: 171.0Â±7.0 Î¼m; NL: 53.4Â±3.8 Î¼m). The slightly shorter internodal length at E18 would reflect an elongation of internode during development in accordance with maturation of the brain size. Thus, the nodal spacing pattern was already determined at the early period of node formation, implying that reorganization of internodes would not contribute to the biased internodal length.</p>

<sec id="s2d">
<title>Morphology of oligodendrocytes differed between tract and NL regions</title>
<p>We next explored the contributions of oligodendrocytes to the regional difference in internodal length by evaluating the morphology of individual oligodendrocytes at E21.

<p>As presumed, length of myelin sheaths differed significantly between the tract and NL regions (tract: 174.1Â±5.0 Î¼m; NL: 59.7Â±2.4 Î¼m) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>), which was consistent with the difference in internodal length between the regions (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>).

In each oligodendrocyte, the average myelin length was shorter by 3 times (tract: 181.1Â±7.3 Î¼m NL: 63.6Â±4.7 Î¼m), the number of myelin sheaths was larger by 2 times (tract: 3.0Â±0.2; NL: 6.6Â±0.6), and the total myelin length was shorter by 1.3 times (tract: 527.9Â±27.2 Î¼m; NL: 394.6Â±29.7 Î¼m) at the NL region compared to the tract region (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3HâJ</xref>).

<title>Axon structure did not contribute to the regional difference in nodal spacing</title>
<p>The distinct oligodendrocyte morphologies imply differences in their intrinsic properties (e.g., the ability to produce and extend myelin sheaths), but the involvement of other external constraints cannot yet be ruled out. The structure of axons, such as branch points and diameter, is one of these external constraints, and can affect myelin extension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Murray &amp; Blakemore, 1980</xref>; Hildebrand et al., 1983; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Ibrahim et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Bechler et al., 2015</xref>; Stedehouder et al., 2019).

<p>The results showed that on the main trunk of the axons, most of the Caspr signals showed mature/immature node patterns, confirming that the axons were almost fully myelinated. These axons formed multiple collateral branches innervating the ventral dendritic layer at the NL region, and triads of paranodal domains were frequently observed at the branch points. The internodal length (73.1Â±2.1 Î¼m) was about 40% shorter compared to the branch point interval (122.5Â±6.7 Î¼m) at the NL region (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E, F</xref>). Correspondingly, the number of internodes between adjacent branch points averaged 1.6 and was correlated with the length of branch point interval (â0â: 27.5Â±3.9 Î¼m; â1â: 79.3Â±5.1 Î¼m; â2â: 156.3Â±7.1 Î¼m; â3â¦â: 232.0Â±10.0 Î¼m) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4H, I</xref>). In areas with very short branch point intervals (bottom 10%: &lt;40 Î¼m), the axon lacked Caspr signals frequently (61.5%), implying that these areas are less likely to be myelinated (internode=0 Î¼m) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4G</xref>). On the other hand, even in areas with long branch point intervals (top 10%: &gt;220 Î¼m), the internodal length did not increase and it was 2 times shorter than that at the tract region (&lt;220 Î¼m: 71.4Â±2.4 Î¼m; &gt;220 Î¼m: 79.9Â±3.9 Î¼m; tract: 164.3Â±4.2 Î¼m) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4J</xref>). These observations suggest that the branch point interval is not a critical determinant of the short internodes at the NL region, although it can be a limiting factor in areas with the shorter branch point interval.</p>
<p>The diameter of axon main trunk did not differ between the tract and NL regions (tract: 1.40Â±0.03 Î¼m; NL: 1.47Â±0.04 Î¼m) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4K</xref>), corresponding to the diameter of myelin sheaths including axon (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref>). This was consistent with the previous report showing that the axon diameter did not differ between the tract and the distal portion of ventral NL, at which the axon main trunk is situated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Seidl et al., 2010</xref>), confirming that the diameter of NM axons is not a factor determining the regional differences in nodal spacing.</p>

<title>Oligodendrogenesis was augmented at NL region</title>
<p>Given that NM axons were fully myelinated, oligodendrocyte density could also be a constraint of individual oligodendrocyte morphology; if the density is high, it may limit the extension of myelin sheath due to mutual competition for territory on the axon. Therefore, we examined the density of oligodendrocyte lineage cells during development by labeling the cells with the Olig2 antibody and quantifying their density at the tract and NL regions between E9 and E21(<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref> top, B).</p>

<p>The results showed that the density of Olig2-positive cells increased with development, peaked at E15, and decreased slightly afterwards. Importantly, the extent of this increase was more robust and about 1.3-fold higher at the NL region than at the tract region. The differences in oligodendrocyte density could result from several factors, including the density of oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs), which mature into oligodendrocytes through several steps of maturation, as well as the migration, proliferation, and differentiation of these cells. We measured the density of OPCs by labeling the cells with Nkx2.2 antibodies (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref> bottom, C) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Xu et al., 2000</xref>). The density of Nkx2.2-positive cells increased sharply and reached a plateau by E12 at both regions, while the extent of this increase was also higher at the NL region. These cells were restricted to the ventral and dorsal fiber layers and almost absent in the somatic and dendritic layers of NL. These results suggest that the density of OPCs increases around the period of hearing onset to a larger extent at the NL region, contributing to the higher density of oligodendrocyte lineage cells at this region. We evaluated the level of proliferation of OPCs with BrdU labeling and found that the density of BrdU-positive cells was significantly higher at the NL region during E12â16 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D, E</xref>). BrdU-positive cells were immunopositive for both Olig2 and Nkx2.2, confirming that they were OPCs (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5F, G</xref>). These results suggest that the higher densities of OPCs and oligodendrocyte lineage cells at the NL region occur through a region-specific facilitation of oligodendrogenesis.</p>

<title>Inhibition of vesicular release did not affect oligodendrocyte morphology but suppressed oligodendrogenesis at NL region</title>
<p>The reduction of myelin sheath density by A3V-eTeNT could occur through a decrease in the number of myelin sheaths formed by each oligodendrocyte and/or through a decrease in the density of oligodendrocytes themselves. To test these possibilities, we sparsely labeled mature oligodendrocytes, while transfecting A3V-eTeNT into bilateral NM neurons, and evaluated the effects of eTeNT on their morphology at E21 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6J, K</xref>).</p>

<p>To determine if inhibiting vesicular release from axons alters proliferation of OPCs, we examined the density of Nkx2.2-positive OPCs and BrdU-positive proliferating cells at E15 in the A3V-eTeNT and control (A3V-GFP) conditions (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6L, M</xref>). In the control group, the density of these cells became higher by 1.5 folds at the NL region compared to the tract region (see also <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C, E</xref>). In the eTeNT group, on the other hand, this enhancement was suppressed, which abolished the difference in the density of these cells between the regions. These data indicate that vesicular release from NM axons promotes oligodendrogenesis specifically at the NL region without altering oligodendrocyte morphology, suggesting that adaptive oligodendrogenesis is important in covering the entire length of the axon with short myelin sheaths at the region (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7AâC</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study identified several factors responsible for biased nodal spacing patterns along axons, including heterogeneity in oligodendrocyte morphology, regional differences in proliferation of OPCs, and activity-dependent signaling from axons through vesicular release.</p>
<p>Using the chick brainstem auditory circuit known for its characteristic nodal spacing as a model, we found that NM axons were almost fully myelinated by oligodendrocytes with distinct morphologies between the two regions having markedly different internodal lengths. This regional heterogeneity reflected differences in the intrinsic property of oligodendrocytes in these two regions rather than the extrinsic constraints. Expression of eTeNT in most of the NM axons caused unmyelinated segments by region-specific suppression of oligodendrogenesis without affecting internodal length or oligodendrocyte morphology, suggesting that primary role of neural activity is to ensure the oligodendrocyte density necessary for full myelination of axons.</p>

<title>Biased nodal spacing pattern reflects regional heterogeneity of oligodendrocyte</title>
    <p>The major factor contributing to regional differences in internodal length along NM axons was regional heterogeneity in oligodendrocyte morphology. The morphological differences were observed not only in the length of myelin sheaths, but also in the number of myelin sheaths and the size of cell bodies (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). Considering the morphological classification of oligodendrocytes by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">PÃ­o del RÃ­o-Hortega (1928)</xref>, oligodendrocytes at the tract and NL regions could be classified into type III and type II, respectively.

Consistent with the idea, OPCs in the brainstem have two developmental origins, derived from the ventral and dorsal sides of the hindbrain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Vallstedt et al., 2005</xref>). In addition, pericellular concentration of some ligands may differ between the tract and NL regions according to the distance from synapses or postsynaptic cells. Whether the gene profiles of oligodendrocytes and OPCs differ between the tract and NL regions and what causes the differences are important issues to be examined in the future.</p>
<p>The regional differences in the morphology of oligodendrocytes would primarily reflect their intrinsic properties specific to each region; the ability of myelin production is higher, while that of myelin extension is lower at the NL region than at the tract region. Supportively, the axonal factors, such as structure and vesicular release, did not affect the regional heterogeneity in oligodendrocyte morphology (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6H</xref>). Oligodendrocyte density did not affect the morphology, either; the number and length of myelin sheaths did not increase even when unmyelinated segments appeared after A3V-eTeNT transfection (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6JâK</xref>). Another potential factor influencing the regional differences in internodal length could be pre-nodal clusters which are formed by cell-autonomous accumulation of nodal components on the axons of certain types of neurons before myelination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Kaplan et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Freeman et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Vagionitis et al., 2022</xref>). However, our immunostaining results failed to detect such clusters on the NM axons. This may be due to limited detection sensitivity or the unavailability of neurofascin antibodies in chickens. Nevertheless, it is unlikely that fixed pre-nodal clusters pre-determine internodal length prior to myelination, given the facts that the length of unmyelinated segments was far shorter than the internodal length at the NL region (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6I</xref>). Thus, we consider that the morphology of oligodendrocyte, and hence the length of myelin sheaths, are determined according to the intrinsic properties of oligodendrocytes at each region, which underlies the regional differentiation of nodal spacing along NM axons. Variations in the intrinsic properties of oligodendrocytes are also reported in other brain regions. Oligodendrocytes in white matter are morphologically distinct from those in gray matter, and their original features did not change even when OPCs were cross-transplanted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">ViganÃ² et al., 2013</xref>). In addition, OPCs collected from different brain regions show their original morphological features when cultured on artificial fibers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Bechler et al., 2015</xref>). In summary, our findings provide the perspective that oligodendrocytes with different intrinsic properties work together to fine-tune the neural circuit function involved in ITD detection.</p>

<title>Adaptive oligodendrogenesis ensures full myelination of axons at NL region</title>
<p>Neuronal activity can affect the proliferation, maturation and morphology of oligodendrocytes, but the effects are not uniform across different neuronal subtypes and brain regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Gibson et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Yang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bonetto et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Osanai et al., 2022</xref>). Indeed, the inhibition of vesicular release had different effects on myelination depending on neuronal subtype; myelination is impaired in some axons, but remains unaffected in others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Mensch et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Koudelka et al., 2016</xref>). In NM axons, activity-dependent signaling did not affect myelin formation in mature oligodendrocytes but instead facilitated proliferation and differentiation of OPCs. Given that this enhancement of oligodendrogenesis occurred specifically at the NL region (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6I</xref>) and that unmyelinated segments were increased only when eTeNT was expressed in a large fraction of the axons via A3V (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6FâG</xref>, Figure 6âfigure supplement 1), exocytosis from the presynaptic terminals of NM axons would cause the effects by altering the perisynaptic microenvironment. Glutamate and several trophic factors such as BDNF, which are released from the terminals of NM axons, may act on the OPC directly via spillover from the synapse and/or indirectly via activation of NL neurons or astrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Du et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Pease-Raissi &amp; Chan, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Fekete &amp; Nishiyama, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">PivoÅkovÃ¡ et al., 2024</xref>). Supportively, mRNA of NR1, a major subunit of NMDA receptor, is strongly expressed in glial cells, presumably oligodendrocyte lineage cells, at the ventral and dorsal dendritic layers of NL after E10 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Tang and Carr, 2007</xref>). Future studies are needed to determine what ligands mediate the differentiation and proliferation of OPCs as the activity-dependent signaling at the NL region and whether there are regional differences in the sensitivity of these OPCs to the ligands along the NM axon.</p>
<p>Adaptive oligodendrogenesis would support the function of brainstem auditory circuits by ensuring the full myelination of NM axons. Full myelination of the auditory pathway enables rapid membrane responses and high metabolic support during high-frequency firing, which are critical for precise and reliable processing of sound information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Kim et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Moore et al., 2020</xref>). Moreover, the full myelination at the NL region, which is mediated by the adaptive enhancement of oligodendrogenesis, would be particularly important for ITD detection. The contralateral projections of NM neurons have a sequential branching structure called a âdelay lineâ at the ventral area of NL in chickens. This delay line produces an output delay of up to 180 Î¼s for contralateral NL neurons along the medial to lateral axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Overholt et al., 1992</xref>). This delay covers the physiological ITD range for the chicken, allowing the ITDs to be encoded in a âplace mapâ within the NL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Jeffress, 1948</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">KÃ¶ppl &amp; Carr, 2008</xref>). This should provide the neural basis for the ability of excellent sound localization in chickens, which can discriminate ITDs of about 20 Î¼s (8.9Â° minimum audible angle) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Krumm et al., 2022</xref>). Reliable myelination of the delay line ensures constant conduction velocity and output delay and hence is critical for precise ITD calculation. Thus, the adaptive oligodendrogenesis at the NL region would be a mechanism that secures the accuracy of ITD calculation in the avian auditory circuit. Interestingly, ITD representation within the NL exhibits plasticity around the period of hearing onset in the barn owl (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Carr et al., 2024</xref>), which coincides with the period of adaptive oligodendrogenesis, speculating its contribution to the plasticity.</p>

<title>Commonalities and differences with the sound localization circuit in mammals</title>
<p>Regional regulation of conduction velocity has also been reported in mammals. In a brainstem auditory circuit of gerbils, which is involved in the processing of ITDs, several regional differentiations have been observed in the nodal spacing along the axon. In the axon of spherical bushy cells, a mammalian homologue of NM neurons, the internodal length is longer for contralateral side than for ipsilateral side, presumably compensating for the different axonal pathlength between the two sides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Seidl &amp; Rubel, 2016</xref>). On the other hand, in the axon of globular bushy cells that project to medial nucleus of trapezoid body, the internodal length is longer for those innervating more medial location (i.e. more distal location), ensuring simultaneous inputs within the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Ford et al., 2015</xref>). These regional differentiations of nodal spacing would be acquired independently in mammals and birds through evolutionary convergence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Lipovsek &amp; Wingate, 2018</xref>), emphasizing their importance in securing ITD computation in the microsecond order. Notably, in globular bushy cells, neural activity did not alter the nodal spacing, but instead regulated the conduction velocity by adaptively changing the axon diameter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Nabel et al., 2024</xref>), suggesting that the mechanism of action of activity-dependent signaling is different among neurons and species. It will be interesting to examine whether regional heterogeneity in the intrinsic properties of oligodendrocytes is a prominent determinant in the biased nodal spacing pattern in mammalian ITD circuits as well. Such comparisons will help to understand the fundamental logic and mechanisms of determining nodal spacing patterns along the axons.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>This study identified the factors mediating the regional differentiation of nodal spacing along single axons in the auditory pathway of chicken; the differentiation of nodal spacing reflects regional heterogeneity in oligodendrocyte morphology, and the activity-dependent signaling from axons via vesicular release contributes to the full myelination of axons through region-specific enhancement of oligodendrogenesis. The results in this model system provide evidence that oligodendrocyte heterogeneity, which is widely observed in the brain, can contributes to achieving optimal timing of signals and optimal function of local circuits in the nervous system.</p>

Contralateral projections of NM neurons were sparsely labeled with GFP-tagged eTeNT (green), and paranodes were visualized with Caspr immunostaining (magenta) in 200-Î¼m-thick brainstem slices (C). The percentages of heminodes and mature/immature nodes (D), as well as the percentage of unmyelinated segments per traced axon at the NL region (E), were comparable to those shown in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6FâG</xref> for A3V-GFP-transfected axons. D: n=102 nodes at tract, n=129 nodes at NL. E: n=26 axons. N=4 chicks. Statistical analysis: Chi-square test (D), Wilcoxon rank sum test (E): *p &lt; 0.05, **p &lt; 0.01, n.s., not significant.</p>

<p>This <bold>important</bold> study uses the delay line axon model in the chick brainstem auditory circuit to examine the interactions between oligodendrocytes and axons in the formation of internodal distances. This is a significant and actively studied topic, and the authors have used this preparation to support the hypothesis that regional heterogeneity in oligodendrocytes underlies the observed variation in internodal length. In a <bold>solid</bold> series of experiments, the authors have used enhanced tetanus neurotoxin light chains, a genetically encoded silencing tool, to inhibit vesicular release from axons and support the hypothesis that regional heterogeneity among oligodendrocytes may underlie the biased nodal spacing pattern in the sound localization circuit.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Egawa et al describe the developmental timeline of the assembly of nodes of Ranvier in the chick brainstem auditory circuit. In this unique system, the spacing between nodes varies significantly in different regions of the same axon from early stages, which the authors suggest is critical for accurate sound localization. Egawa et al set out to determine which factors regulate this differential node spacing. They do this by using immunohistological analyses to test the correlation of node spacing with morphological properties of the axons, and properties of oligodendrocytes, glial cells that wrap axons with the myelin sheaths that flank the nodes of Ranvier. They find that axonal structure does not vary significantly, but that oligodendrocyte density and morphology varies in the different regions traversed by these axons, which suggests this is a key determinant of the region-specific differences in node density and myelin sheath length. They also find that differential oligodendrocyte density is partly determined by secreted neuronal signals, as (presumed) blockage of vesicle fusion with tetanus toxin reduced oligodendrocyte density in the region where it is normally higher. Based on these findings, the authors propose that oligodendrocyte morphology, myelin sheath length, and consequently nodal distribution are primarily determined by intrinsic oligodendrocyte properties rather than neuronal factors such as activity.</p>
<p>Major comments:</p>
<p>(1) The authors should test the efficiency of TeNT to validate that vesicular release is indeed inhibited from expressing neurons. Additionally, the authors should clarify if their TeNT expression system results in the whole tract being silenced, or results in sparse vesicular release inhibition in only a few neurons.</p>
<p>(2) The authors should revise their statistical analyses throughout, and supply additional information to explain the rationale for the statistical tests used, including e.g. data normality, paired sampling, number of samples/independent biological replicates.</p>
<p>(3) The main finding of the study is that the density of nodes differs between two regions of the chicken auditory circuit, probably due to morphological differences in the respective oligodendrocytes. Can the authors discuss if this finding is likely to be specific to the avian auditory circuit?</p>
<p>(4) The study shows a correlation between node spacing and oligodendrocyte density, but the authors did not manipulate oligodendrocyte density per se (i.e. cell-autonomously). The authors should either include such experiments, or discuss their value in supporting the interpretation of their results.</p>
<p>(5) The authors should discuss very pertinent prior studies, in particular to contextualize their findings with (a) known neuron-autonomous modes of node formation prior to myelination, (b) known effects of vesicular fusion directly on myelinating capacity and oligodendrogenesis, (c) known correlation of myelin length and thickness with axonal diameter, (d) regional heterogeneity in the oligodendrocyte transcriptome.</p>
<p>Significance:</p>
<p>In our view the study tackles a fundamental question likely to be of interest to a specialized audience of cellular neuroscientists. This descriptive study is suggestive that in the studied system, oligodendrocyte density determines the spacing between nodes of Ranvier, but further manipulations of oligodendrocyte density per se are needed to test this convincingly.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors have investigated the myelination pattern along the axons of chick avian cochlear nucleus. It has already been shown that there are regional differences in the internodal length of axons in the nucleus magnocellularis. In the tract region across the midline, internodes are longer than in the nucleus laminaris region. Here the authors suggest that the difference in internodal length is attributed to heterogeneity of oligodendrocytes. In the tract region oligodendrocytes would contribute longer myelin internodes, while oligodendrocytes in the nucleus laminaris region would synthesize shorter myelin internodes. Not only length of myelin internodes differs, but also along the same axon unmyelinated areas between two internodes may vary. This is an interesting contribution since all these differences contribute to differential conduction velocity regulating ipsilateral and contralateral innervation of coincidence detector neurons. However, the demonstration falls rather short of being convincing.</p>
<p>Major comments:</p>
<p>(1) The authors neglect the possibility that nodal cluster may be formed prior to myelin deposition. They have investigated stages E12 (no nodal clusters) and E15 (nodal cluster plus MAG+ myelin). Fig. 1D is of dubious quality. It would be important to investigate stages between E12 and E15 to observe the formation of pre-nodes, i.e., clustering of nodal components prior to myelin deposition.</p>
<p>(2) The claim that axonal diameter is constant along the axonal length need to be demonstrated at the EM level. This would also allow to measure possible regional differences in the thickness of the myelin sheath and number of myelin wraps.</p>
<p>(3) The observation that internodal length differs is explain by heterogeneity of sources of oligodendrocyte is not convincing. Oligodendrocytes a priori from the same origin remyelinate shorter internode after a demyelination event.</p>
<p>Significance:</p>
<p>The authors suggest that the difference in internodal length is attributed to heterogeneity of oligodendrocytes. In the tract region oligodendrocytes would contribute longer myelin internodes, while oligodendrocytes in the nucleus laminaris region would synthesize shorter myelin internodes. Not only length of myelin internodes differs, but also along the same axon unmyelinated areas between two internodes may vary. This is an interesting contribution since all these differences contribute to differential conduction velocity regulating ipsilateral and contralateral innervation of coincidence detector neurons.</p>
<p>Comments on revised version:</p>
<p>This revised version is in large improved and the responses to reviewers' comments are generally relevant. However, the response regarding pre-nodes is not satisfactory. I understand that the authors prefer to avoid further experimentations, but I think this is an important point that needs to be clarified. Exploring stages between E12 and E15 are therefore of importance. When carefully examining some of the figures (Fig. 1E or 2D) I think that at E15 they may well be pre-nodes formation prior to myelin deposition, on structure the authors considered to be heminodes. To be convincing they should use double or triple labeling with, in addition to the nodal proteins (ankG and/or Nav pan), a good myelin marker such as antiPLP. The rat monoclonal developed by late Pr Ikenaka would give a sharper staining than the anti MAG they used. (I assume the clone must still be available in Okazaki ).</p>

<p>The following is the authorsâ response to the original reviews</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #1:</bold></p>
<p>Evidence, reproducibility and clarity</p>
<p>The manuscript by Egawa and colleagues investigates differences in nodal spacing in an avian auditory brain stem circuit. The results are clearly presented and data are of very high quality. The authors make two main conclusions:</p>
<p>(1) Node spacing, i.e. internodal length, is intrinsically specified by the oligodendrocytes in the region they are found in, rather than axonal properties (branching or diameter).</p>
<p>(2) Activity is necessary (we don't know what kind of signaling) for normal numbers of oligodendrocytes and therefore the extent of myelination.</p>
<p>These are interesting observations, albeit phenomenon. I have only a few criticisms that should be addressed:</p>
<p>(1) The use of the term 'distribution' when describing the location of nodes is confusing. I think the authors mean rather than the patterns of nodal distribution, the pattern of nodal spacing. They have investigated spacing along the axon. I encourage the authors to substitute node spacing or internodal length for node distribution.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks for your suggestion to avoid confusion. We used the phrase &quot;nodal spacing&quot; instead of &quot;nodal distribution&quot; throughout the revised manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) In Seidl et al. (J Neurosci 2010) it was reported that axon diameter and internodal length (nodal spacing) were different for regions of the circuit. Can the authors help me better understand the difference between the Seidl results and those presented here?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As a key distinction, our study focuses specifically on the main trunk of the contralateral projection of NM axons. This projection features a sequential branching structure known as the delay line, where collateral branches form terminal arbors and connect to the ventral dendritic layer of NL neurons. This structural organization plays a critical role in influencing the dynamic range of ITD detection by regulating conduction delays along the NM axon trunk.</p>
<p>The study by Seidl et al. (2010) is a pioneering work that measured diameter of NM axon using electron microscopy, providing highly reliable data. However, due to the technical  limitations of electron microscopy, which does not allow for the continuous tracing of individual axons, it is not entirely clear whether the axons measured in the ventral NL region correspond to terminal arbors of collateral branches or the main trunk of NM axons (see Figure 9E, F in their paper). Instead, they categorized axon diameters based on their distance from NL cell layer, showing that axon diameter increases distally (see Figure 9G in their paper). Notably, the diameters of ventral axons located more than 120 Î¼m away from the NL cell layer is almost identical to those in the midline.</p>
<p>As illustrated in our Figure 4D and Supplementary Video 2, the main trunk of the contralateral NM projection is predominantly located in these distal regions. Therefore, our findings complement those of Seidl et al. (2010) rather than contradicting them. We made this point as clear as possible in text (page 7, line 3).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) The authors looked only in very young animals - are the results reported here applicable only to development, or does additional refinement take place with aging?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In this study, we examined chick embryos from E9 to just before hatching (E21) and post-hatch chicks up to P9. Chickens begin to perceive sound around E12 and possess sound localization abilities at the time of hatching (Grier et al., 1967) (added to page 4, line 9). Therefore, by E21, the sound localization circuit is largely established.</p>
<p>On the other hand, additional refinement of the circuit with aging is certainly possible. A key cue for sound localization, interaural time difference (ITD), depends on the distance between the two ears, which increases as the animal grows. As shown in Figure 2G, internodal length increased by approximately 20% between E18 and P9 while maintaining regional differences. Given that NM axons are nearly fully myelinated by E21 (Figure 4D, 6C), this suggests that myelin extends in proportion to the overall growth of the head and brain volume. We described this possibility in text (page 5, line 21)</p>
<p>Thus, our study covers not only the early stages of myelination but also the post-functional maturation in the sound localization circuit.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) The fact that internodal length is specified by the oligodendrocyte suggests that activity may not modify the location of nodes of Ranvier - although again, the authors have only looked during early development. This is quite different than this reviewer's original thoughts - that activity altered internodal length and axon diameter. Thus, the results here argue against node plasticity. The authors may choose to highlight this point or argue for or against it based on results in adult birds?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In this study, we demonstrated that although vesicular release did not affect internodal length, it selectively promoted oligodendrogenesis, thereby supporting the full myelination and hence the pattern of nodal spacing along the NM axons. We believe that this finding falls within the broader scope of 'activity-dependent plasticity' involving oligodendrocytes and nodes.</p>
<p>As summarized in the excellent review by Bonetto et al. (2021), activity-dependent plasticity in oligodendrocytes encompasses a wide range of phenomena, not limited to changes in internodal length but also including oligodendrogenesis. Moreover, the effects of neuronal activity are not uniform but likely depend on the diversity of both neurons and oligodendrocytes. For example, in the mouse visual cortex, activity-dependent myelination occurs in interneurons but not in excitatory neurons (Yang et al., 2020). Additionally, expression of TeNT in axons affected myelination heterogeneously in zebrafish; some axons were impaired in myelination and the others were not affected at all (Koudelka et al., 2016). In the mouse corpus callosum, neuronal activity influences oligodendrogenesis, which in turn facilitates adaptive myelination (Gibson et al., 2014).</p>
<p>Thus, rather than refuting the role of activity-dependent plasticity in nodal spacing, our findings emphasize the diversity of underlying regulatory mechanisms. We described these explicitly in text (page 10, line 18).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Significance</p>
<p>This paper may argue against node plasticity as a mechanism for tuning of neural circuits. Myelin plasticity is a very hot topic right now and node plasticity reflects myelin plasticity. this seems to be a circuit where perhaps plasticity is NOT occurring. That would be interesting to test directly. One limitation is that this is limited to development.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This paper does not argue against node plasticity, but rather demonstrates that oligodendrocytes in the NL region exhibit a form of plasticity; they proliferate in response to vesicular release from NM axons, yet do not undergo morphological changes, ensuring adequate oligodendrocyte density for the full myelination of the auditory circuit. Thus, activity-dependent plasticity involving oligodendrocytes would contributes in various ways to each neural circuit, which is presumably attributed to the fact that myelination is driven by complex multicellular interactions between diverse axons and oligodendrocytes. Oligodendrocytes are known to exhibit heterogeneity in morphology, function, responsiveness, and gene profiles (Foerster et al., 2019; Sherafat et al., 2021; Osanai et al., 2022; Valihrach et al., 2022), but functional significance of this heterogeneity remains largely unclear. This paper also provides insight into how oligodendrocyte heterogeneity may contribute to the fine-tuning of neural circuit function, adding further value to our findings. Importantly, our study covers the wide range of development in the sound localization circuit, from the pre-myelination (E9) to the postfunctional maturation (P9), revealing how the nodal spacing pattern along the axon in this circuit emerges and matures.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2:</bold></p>
<p>Evidence, reproducibility and clarity</p>
<p>Egawa et al describe the developmental timeline of the assembly of nodes of Ranvier in the chick brainstem auditory circuit. In this unique system, the spacing between nodes varies significantly in different regions of the same axon from early stages, which the authors suggest is critical for accurate sound localization.

They also find that differential oligodendrocyte density is partly determined by secreted neuronal signals, as (presumed) blockage of vesicle fusion with tetanus toxin reduced oligodendrocyte density in the region where it is normally higher. Based on these findings, the authors propose that oligodendrocyte morphology, myelin sheath length, and consequently nodal distribution are primarily determined by intrinsic oligodendrocyte properties rather than neuronal factors such as activity.</p>
<p>Major points, detailed below, need to be addressed to overcome some limitations of the study.</p>
<p>Major comments:</p>
<p>(1) It is essential that the authors validate the efficiency of TeNT to prove that vesicular release is indeed inhibited, to be able to make any claims about the effect of vesicular release on oligodendrogenesis/myelination.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>eTeNT is a widely used genetically encoded silencing tool and constructs similar to the one used in this study have been successfully applied in primates and rodents to suppress target behaviors via genetic dissection of specific pathways (Kinoshita et al., 2012; Sooksawate et al., 2013). However, precisely quantifying the extent of vesicular release inhibition from NM axons in the brainstem auditory circuit is technically problematic.</p>
<p>One major limitation is that while A3V efficiently infects NM neurons, its transduction efficiency does not reach 100%. In electrophysiological evaluations, NL neurons receive inputs from multiple NM axons, meaning that responses may still include input from uninfected axons. Additionally, failure to evoke synaptic responses could either indicate successful silencing or failure to stimulate NM axons, making a clear distinction difficult. Furthermore, unlike in motor circuits, we cannot assess the effect of silencing by observing behavioral outputs.</p>
<p>Thus, we instead opted to quantify the precise expression efficiency of GFP-tagged eTeNT in the cell bodies of NM neurons. The proportion of NM neurons expressing GFP-tagged eTeNT was 89.7 Â± 1.6% (N = 6 chicks), which is consistent with previous reports evaluating A3V transduction efficiency in the brainstem auditory circuit (Matsui et al., 2012). These results strongly suggest that synaptic transmission from NM axons was globally silenced by eTeNT at the NL region. We described these explicitly in text (page 8, line 2).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) Related to 1, can the authors clarify if their TeNT expression system results in the whole tract being silenced? It appears from Fig. 6 that their approach leads to sparse expression of TeNT in individual neurons, which enables them to measure myelination parameters. Can the authors discuss how silencing a single axon can lead to a regional effect in oligodendrocyte number?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Figure 6D depicts a representative axon selected from a dense population of GFP-positive axons in a 200-Î¼m-thick slice after A3V-eTeNT infection to bilateral NM. As shown in Supplementary Video 1 and 2, densely labeled GFP-positive axons can be traced along the main trunk. To prevent any misinterpretation, we have revised the description of Figure 6 in the main text and Figure legend (page 31, line 9), and stated the A3V-eTeNT infection efficiency was 89.7 Â± 1.6% in NM neurons, as mentioned above. Based on this efficiency, we interpreted that the global occlusion of vesicular release from most of the NM axons altered the pericellular microenvironment of the NL region, which led to the regional effect on the oligodendrocyte density.</p>
<p>On the other hand, your question regarding whether sparse expression of eTeNT still has an effect is highly relevant. As we also discussed in our reply to comment 4 by Reviewer #1, the relationship between neuronal activity and oligodendrocytes is highly diverse. In some types of axons, vesicular release is essential for normal myelination, and this process was disrupted by TeNT (Koudelka et al., 2016), suggesting that direct interaction with oligodendrocytes via vesicle release may actively promote myelination in these types of axons.</p>
<p>To clarify whether the phenotype observed in Figure 6 arises from changes in the pericellular microenvironment at the NL region or from the direct suppression of axon-oligodendrocyte interactions, we included a new Supplementary Figure (Figure 6âfigure supplement 1). In this figure, we evaluated the node formation on the axon sparsely expressing eTeNT by electroporation into the unilateral NM. The results showed that sparse eTeNT expression did not increase the percentages of heminodes or unmyelinated segments. This finding supports our conclusion that the increased unmyelinated segments by A3V-eTeNT resulted from impaired synaptic transmission at NM terminals and subsequent alterations of  pericellular microenvironment at the NL region.</p>

<p>(3) The authors need to fully revise their statistical analyses throughout and supply additional information that is needed to assess if their analyses are adequate:</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your valuable suggestions to improve the rigor of our statistical analyses. We have reanalyzed all statistical tests using R software. In the revised Methods section and Figure Legends, we have clarified the rationale for selecting each statistical test, specified which test was used for each figure, and explicitly defined both n and N. After reevaluation with the Shapiro-Wilk test, we adjusted some analyses to non-parametric tests where appropriate. However, these adjustments did not alter the statistical significance of our results compared to the original analyses.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3.1) the authors use a variety of statistical tests and it is not always obvious why they chose a particular test. For example, in Fig. 2G they chose a Kruskal-Wallis test instead of a two-way ANOVA or MannWhitney U test, which are much more common in the field. What is the rationale for the test choice?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have revised the explanation of our statistical test choices to provide greater clarity and precision. For example, in Figure 2G, we first assessed the normality of the data in each of the four groups using the Shapiro-Wilk test, which revealed that some datasets did not follow a normal distribution. Given this, we selected the Kruskal-Wallis test, a commonly used non-parametric test for comparisons across three or more groups. Since the Kruskal-Wallis test indicated a significant difference, we conducted a post hoc Steel-Dwass test to determine which specific group comparisons were statistically significant.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3.2) in some cases, the choice of test appears wholly inappropriate. For example, in Fig. 3H-K, an unpaired t-test is inappropriate if the two regions were analysed in the same samples. In Fig. 5, was a ttest used for comparisons between multiple groups in the same dataset? If so, an ANOVA may be more appropriate.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In the case of Figures 3H-K, we compared oligodendrocyte morphology between regions. However, since the number of sparsely labeled oligodendrocytes differs both between regions and across individual samples, there is no strict correspondence between paired measurements. On the other hand, in Figures 5B, C, and E, we compared the density of labeled cells between regions within the same slice, establishing a direct correspondence between paired data points. For these comparisons, we appropriately used a paired t-test.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3.3) in some cases, the authors do not mention which test was used (Fig 3: E-G no test indicated, despite asterisks; G/L/M - which regression test that was used? What does r indicate?)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have specified the statistical tests used for each figure in the Methods section and Figure Legends for better clarity. Additionally, we have revised the descriptions for Figure 4G, L, and M and their corresponding Figure Legends to explicitly indicate that Spearmanâs rank correlation coefficient (râ) was used for evaluation.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3.4) more concerningly, throughout the results, data may have been pseudo-replicated. t-tests and ANOVAs assume that each observation in a dataset is independent of the other observations. In figures 1-4 and 6 there is a very large &quot;n&quot; number, but the authors do not indicate what this corresponds to. This leaves it open to interpretation, and the large values suggest that the number of nodes, internodal segments, or cells may have been used. These are not independent experimental units, and should be averaged per independent biological replicate - i.e. per animal (N).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have now clarified what ânâ represents in each figure, as well as the number of animals (N) used in each experiment, in the Figure Legends.</p>
<p>In this study, developmental stages of chick embryos were defined by HH stage (Hamburger and Hamilton, 1951), minimizing individual variability. Additionally, since our study focuses on the distribution of morphological characteristics of individual cells, averaging measurements per animal would obscure important cellular-level variability and potentially mislead interpretation of data. Furthermore, we employed a strategy of sparse genetic labeling in many experiments, which naturally results in variability in the number of measurable cells per animal. Given the clear distinctions in our data distributions, we believe that averaging per biological replicate is not essential in this case.</p>
<p>To further ensure the robustness of our statistical analysis, data presented as boxplots were preliminarily assessed using PlotsOfDifferences, a web-based application that calculates and visualizes effect sizes and 95% confidence intervals based on bootstrapping (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://huygens.science.uva.nl/PlotsOfDifferences/">https://huygens.science.uva.nl/PlotsOfDifferences/</ext-link>; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1101/578575">https://doi.org/10.1101/578575</ext-link>). Effect sizes can serve as a valuable alternative to p-values (Ho, 2018; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592019-0470-3">https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592019-0470-3</ext-link>). The significant differences reported in our study are also supported by clear differences in effect sizes, ensuring that our conclusions remain robust regardless of the statistical approach used.</p>
<p>If requested, we would be happy to provide PlotsOfDifferences outputs as supplementary source data files, similar to those used in eLife publications, for each figure.</p>

<p>(4) The main finding of the study is that the density of nodes differs between two regions of the chicken auditory circuit, probably due to morphological differences in the respective oligodendrocytes. Can the authors discuss if this finding is likely to be specific to the bird auditory circuit?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The morphological differences of oligodendrocytes between white and gray matter are well established (i.e. shorter myelin at gray matter), but their correspondence with the nodal spacing pattern along the long axonal projections of cortical neurons is not well understood. Future research may find similarities with our findings. Additionally, as mentioned in the final section of the Discussion, the mammalian brainstem auditory circuit is functionally analogous to the avian ITD circuit. Regional differences in nodal spacing along axons have also been observed in the mammalian system, raising the important question of whether these differences are supported by regional heterogeneity in oligodendrocytes. Investigating this possibility will facilitate our understanding of the underlying logic and mechanisms for determining node spacing patterns along axons, as well as provide valuable insights into evolutionary convergence in auditory processing mechanisms. We described these explicitly in text (page 11, line 34).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) Provided the authors amend their statistical analyses, and assuming significant differences remain as shown, the study shows a correlation (but not causation) between node spacing and oligodendrocyte density, but the authors did not manipulate oligodendrocyte density per se (i.e. cell-autonomously). Therefore, the authors should either include such experiments, or revise some of their phrasing to soften their claims and conclusions. For example, the word &quot;determine&quot; in the title could be replaced by &quot;correlate with&quot; for a more accurate representation of the work. Similar sentences throughout the main text should be amended.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As you summarized in your comment, our results demonstrated that A3V-eTeNT suppressed oligodendrogenesis in the NL region, leading to a reduction in oligodendrocyte density (Figures 6L, M), which caused the emergence of unmyelinated segments. While this is an indirect manipulation of oligodendrocyte density, it nonetheless provides evidence supporting a causal relationship between oligodendrocyte density and nodal spacing.</p>
<p>The emergence of unmyelinated segments at the NL region further suggests that the myelin extension capacity of oligodendrocytes differs between regions, highlighting regional differences in intrinsic properties of oligodendrocyte as the most prominent determinant of nodal spacing variation. However, as you correctly pointed out, our findings do not establish direct causation.</p>
<p>In the future, developing methods to artificially manipulate myelin length could provide a more definitive demonstration of causality. Given these considerations, we have modified the title to replace &quot;determine&quot; with &quot;underlie&quot;, ensuring that our conclusions are presented with appropriate nuance.</p>

<p>(8) The Olig2 staining in Fig 2C does not appear to be nuclear, as would be expected of a transcription factor and as is well established for Olig2, but rather appears to be excluded from the nucleus, as it is in a ring or donut shape. Can the authors comment on this?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Oligodendrocytes and OPCs have small cell bodies, often comparable in size to their nuclei. The central void in the ring-like Olig2 staining pattern appears too small to represent the nucleus. Additionally, a similar ring-like appearance is observed in BrdU labeling (Figure 5G), suggesting that this staining pattern may reflect nuclear morphology or other structural features.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Significance</p>
<p>In our view the study tackles a fundamental question likely to be of interest to a specialized audience of cellular neuroscientists. This descriptive study is suggestive that in the studied system, oligodendrocyte density determines the spacing between nodes of Ranvier, but further manipulations of oligodendrocyte density per se are needed to test this convincingly.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The main finding of our study is that the primary determinant of the biased nodal spacing pattern in the sound localization circuit is the regional heterogeneity in the morphology of oligodendrocytes due to their intrinsic properties (e.g., their ability to produce and extend myelin sheaths) rather than the density of the cells. This was based on our observations that a reduction of oligodendrocyte density by A3V-eTeNT expression caused unmyelinated segments but did not increase internodal length (Figure 6), further revealing the importance of oligodendrocyte density in ensuring full myelination for the axons with short internodes. Thus, we think that our study could propose the significance of oligodendrocyte heterogeneity in the circuit function as well as in the nodal spacing using experimental manipulation of oligodendrocyte density.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #3:</bold></p>
<p>Evidence, reproducibility and clarity</p>
<p>The authors have investigated the myelination pattern along the axons of chick avian cochlear nucleus. It has already been shown that there are regional differences in the internodal length of axons in the nucleus magnocellularis. In the tract region across the midline, internodes are longer than in the nucleus laminaris region. Here the authors suggest that the difference in internodal length is attributed to heterogeneity of oligodendrocytes. In the tract region oligodendrocytes would contribute longer myelin internodes, while oligodendrocytes in the nucleus laminaris region would synthesize shorter myelin internodes. Not only length of myelin internodes differs, but also along the same axon unmyelinated areas between two internodes may vary. This is an interesting contribution since all these differences contribute to differential conduction velocity regulating ipsilateral and contralateral innervation of coincidence detector neurons. However, the demonstration falls rather short of being convincing. I have some major concerns:</p>
<p>(1) The authors neglect the possibility that nodal cluster may be formed prior to myelin deposition. They have investigated stages E12 (no nodal clusters) and E15 (nodal cluster plus MAG+ myelin). Fig. 1D is of dubious quality. It would be important to investigate stages between E12 and E15 to observe the formation of pre-nodes, i.e., clustering of nodal components prior to myelin deposition.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your insightful comment regarding the potential role of pre-nodal clusters in determining internodal length. Indeed, studies in zebrafish have suggested that pre-nodal clustering of node components prior to myelination may prefigure internodal length (Vagionitis et al., 2022). We have incorporated a discussion on whether such pre-nodal clusters could contribute to regional differences in nodal spacing in our manuscript (page 9, line 35).</p>
<p>Whether pre-nodal clusters are detectable before myelination appears to depend on neuronal subpopulation (Freeman et al., 2015). To investigate the presence of pre-nodal clusters along NM axons in the brainstem auditory circuit, we previously attempted to visualize AnkG signals at E13 and E14. However, we did not observe clear structures indicative of pre-nodal clusters; instead, we only detected sparse fibrous AnkG signals with weak Nav clustering at their ends, consistent with hemi-node features. This result does not exclude the possibility of pre-nodal clusters on NM axons, as the detection limit of immunostaining cannot be ruled out. In brainstem slices, where axons are densely packed, nodal molecules are expressed at low levels across a wide area, leading to a high background signal in immunostaining, which may mask weak pre-nodal cluster signals prior to myelination. Regarding the comment on Figure 1D, we assume you are referring to Figure 2D based on the context. The lack of clarity in the high-magnification images in Figure 2D results from both the high background signal and the limited penetration of the MAG antibody. Furthermore, we are unable to verify Neurofascin accumulation at pre-nodal clusters, as there is currently no commercially available antibody suitable for use in chickens, despite our over 20 years of efforts to identify one for AIS research. Therefore, current methodologies pose significant challenges in visualizing pre-nodal clusters in our model. Future advancements, such as exogenous expression of fluorescently tagged Neurofascin at appropriate densities or knock-in tagging of endogenous molecules, may help overcome these limitations.</p>
<p>However, a key issue to be discussed in this study is not merely the presence or absence of prenodal clusters, but rather whether pre-nodal clustersâif presentâwould determine regional differences in internodal length. To address this possibility, we have added new data in Figure 6I, measuring the length of unmyelinated segments that emerged following A3V-eTeNT expression.</p>
<p>If pre-nodal clusters were fixed before myelination and predetermined internodal length, then the length of unmyelinated segments should be equal to or a multiple of the typical internodal length. However, our data showed that unmyelinated segments in the NL region were less than half the length of the typical NL internodal length, contradicting the hypothesis that fixed pre-nodal clusters determine internodal length along NM axons in this region.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) The claim that axonal diameter is constant along the axonal length need to be demonstrated at the EM level. This would also allow to measure possible regional differences in the thickness of the myelin sheath and number of myelin wraps.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As mentioned in our reply to comment 2 by Reviewer #1, the diameter of NM axons was already evaluated using electron microscopy (EM) in the pioneering study by Seidl et al., (2010). Additionally, EM-based analysis makes it difficult to clearly distinguish between the main trunk of NM axons and thin collateral branches at the NL region. Accordingly, we did not do the EM analysis in this revision.</p>
<p>In Figure 4, we used palGFP, which is targeted to the cell membrane, allowing us to measure axon diameter by evaluating the distance between two membrane signal peaks. This approach minimizes the influence of the blurring of fluorescence signals on diameter measurements. Thus, we believe that our method is sufficient to evaluate the relative difference in axon diameters between regions and hence to show that axon diameter is not the primary determinant of the 3-fold difference in internodal length between regions.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) The observation that internodal length differs is explain by heterogeneity of sources of oligodendrocyte is not convincing. Oligodendrocytes a priori from the same origin remyelinate shorter internode after a demyelination event.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The heterogeneity in oligodendrocyte morphology would reflect differences in gene profiles, which, in turn, may arise from differences in their developmental origin and/or pericellular microenvironment of OPCs. We made this point as clear as possible in Discussion (page 9, line 21).</p>
