<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Cryptic pockets are of growing interest as potential drug targets, particularly to control protein-nucleic acid interactions that often occur via flat surfaces. However, it remains unclear whether cryptic pockets contribute to protein function or if they are merely happenstantial features that can easily be evolved away to achieve drug resistance. Here, we explore whether a cryptic pocket in the Interferon Inhibitory Domain (IID) of viral protein 35 (VP35) of Zaire ebolavirus aids its ability to bind double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). We use simulations and experiments to study the relationship between cryptic pocket opening and dsRNA binding of the IIDs of two other filoviruses, Reston and Marburg. These homologs have nearly identical structures but block different interferon pathways due to different affinities for blunt ends and backbone of the dsRNA. Simulations and thiol-labeling experiments demonstrate that the homologs have varying probabilities of pocket opening. Subsequent dsRNA-binding assays suggest that closed conformations preferentially bind dsRNA blunt ends while open conformations prefer binding the backbone. Point mutations that modulate pocket opening proteins further confirm this preference. These results demonstrate the open cryptic pocket has a function, suggesting cryptic pockets are under selective pressure and may be difficult to evolve away to achieve drug resistance.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Cryptic pockets have garnered significant attention, particularly for their potential as drug targets, but it remains unclear whether they play a role in protein function. Cryptic pockets are pockets that are not observed in the experimentally obtained structure of a protein but form due to thermal fluctuations in the native structure(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>). They are an interesting class of protein dynamics as they are increasingly being explored as drug targets(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>). Allosteric modulators that target cryptic pockets provide many advantages over orthosteric drugs(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>). Cryptic pockets can provide a means to target proteins that appear to be undruggable due to a lack of potential binding pockets in experimentally-derived snapshots of the protein, as is often the case with protein-nucleic acid interactions(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>). Further, they allow non-competitive regulation, higher specificity due to greater variation of pocket dynamics within protein families than variation in active or functional sites(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>), and the possibility of enhancing and not just inhibiting function(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>). However, successfully drugging a cryptic pocket would create a selective pressure for the organism to evolve protein variants that lack the pocket to achieve drug resistance. If cryptic pockets are happenstantial features that have no functional significance, then evolving them away could be trivial. On the other hand, it could be impossible to evolve away a cryptic pocket if the pocket is an inevitable consequence of the proteinâs topology. Alternatively, it could be difficult to evolve away a cryptic pocket if the open state plays a functional role. To explore these possibilities, it would be useful to study the conservation of cryptic pockets across protein variants.</p>
<p>While there are several examples of functional protein dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>), studying cryptic pockets and assessing their functional relevance has been challenging. Cryptic pockets have largely been identified serendipitously when inhibitor-bound structures of proteins are solved and show the inhibitor binds in a cryptic pocket (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>). While finding such structures proves the existence of cryptic pockets, it does not provide a facile means to quantify the probability of pocket opening or study the effects of sequence variation on pocket opening in the absence of a ligand. Enhanced sampling simulations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>) and experimental techniques such as room temperature crystallography (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>), T-jump spectroscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>), T-jump crystallography (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>), and thiol labeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>) have been used to study protein dynamics, including cryptic pocket opening, and provide an opportunity to assess the conservation of these structural features.</p>
<p>Here, we explore the functional significance of a cryptic pocket that we recently discovered in VP35 protein from Zaire ebolavirus, which is the virus that causes the disease commonly known as Ebola. VP35 plays an essential role in filovirus immune evasion by binding dsRNA that is formed during replication of the viral genome to prevent these nucleic acids from being discovered by host innate immune receptors such as RIG-I and MDA5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>). The dsRNA binding affinity of the IID is a significant determinant of virulence, making it an appealing therapeutic target(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>). Though a few studies have attempted to find small molecule drugs to target this protein(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>), none have resulted in a successful drug discovery campaign. The IID interacts with RNA via flat surfaces that are often difficult to drug, with some going as far as calling these surfaces âundruggableâ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>). We discovered a cryptic pocket in VP35 that allosterically controls dsRNA binding, thereby providing a potential means to target this protein(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>). However, targeting this pocket would be of little utility if the pocket is just happenstance and the virus can easily evolve resistance by acquiring mutations that prevent the pocket from opening without any fitness cost. Therefore, it is important to understand if the cryptic pocket has a functional role that may be under selective pressure and make the evolution of drug resistance more difficult.</p>
<p>To explore the functional relevance of this cryptic pocket, we used a combination of simulations and experiments to study the relationship between cryptic pocket opening and dsRNA binding in the IIDs of two other filoviruses, Reston ebolavirus (Reston) and Marburg marburgvirus (Marburg). Zaire binds to dsRNA blunt ends, thereby blocking RIG-I binding to the RNA. It can also bind to the backbone to block MDA5 binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>). In contrast, Marburg binds the backbone but not the blunt ends, thereby blocking MDA5 binding but is unable to block RIG-I binding to shorter blunt ended RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>). Reston is known to bind both blunt ends and the backbone of the RNA but is a slightly weaker inhibitor of the interferon response than Zaire (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>). However, it is difficult to explain these differences given that the crystal structures of all three variants are essentially identical in both their RNA-bound and free forms (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>) and all three variants have high sequence similarity in residues directly interacting with dsRNA (Fig S1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>). Therefore, we hypothesized that differences in cryptic pocket dynamics are responsible for the functional differences between VP35 homologs.</p>

<title>Simulations predict the probability of cryptic pocket opening is low in Reston and high in Marburg compared to Zaire</title>
<p>To assess the probability of cryptic pocket opening in the three filoviruses, we first used molecular dynamics simulations guided by adaptive sampling. We first ran 8 Î¼s of simulation of each variant using a goal-oriented adaptive sampling algorithm called FAST (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>) that balances between broad exploration of conformational space and focusing data acquisition on conformations with more open pockets. We then built a Markov State Model (MSM) of each homolog from these simulations and used the centers as seeds for long MD simulations on the Folding@home distributed computing platform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>). We collected a total of 126 and 124 Î¼s of data for Reston and Marburg IIDs. Then we built a new MSM for each variant that incorporates the data from Folding@home. The cryptic pocket observed in Zaire IID occurs as the helix spanning residue 305 to 309 moves away from the alpha helical domain. Therefore, we characterize pocket opening based on the distance between residues 236 and 306 in Zaire, which corresponds to residues 225 and 295 in Reston and Marburg. For the sake of brevity, unless mentioned otherwise, we will use Reston and Marburg numbering going forward. We thus obtain the probability distribution of the distance between residues 225 and 295 based on the equilibrium probability of each structure in the MSM (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>).</p>
<fig id="fig2" position="float" fig-type="figure">
<label>Figure 2.</label>
<caption><title>Simulations predict the probability of pocket opening is lowest in Reston and highest in Marburg.</title>
<p>Each curve is the probability distribution of the distance between two residues that serves as a proxy for pocket opening. Reston VP35 IID (red) shows the least probability of opening the pocket. Zaire VP35 IID shows a greater probability of opening the pocket as well as an increased maximum distance of pocket opening. Marburg VP35 IID shows the highest probability of pocket opening and the highest maximum distance of pocket opening. The shadow around each curve shows the distributions obtained for 100 MSMs constructed using random samples of the data chosen with replacement to indicate the statistical variability in the MSM construction. The solid line indicates the mean equilibrium probability of all the bootstraps. The structure with the largest pocket (i.e. largest distance between the two residues) for each variant is shown in ribbon with a transparent surface, using the same color scheme as for the probability distributions. Residues 225 (236 in Zaire) and 295 (306 in Zaire) are shown in yellow sticks.</p></caption>
<graphic xlink:href="609218v4_fig2.tif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/>
</fig>
<p>We find that Marburg has a higher probability of opening than Zaire, but that Reston has a significantly lower probability (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>). Furthermore, Marburg opens more widely than the other variants, as judged by reaching larger distances between residues 225 and 295 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref> insets). We also performed CARDS analysis(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>) on the Marburg and Reston IID simulations to compare to the allosteric network obtained for Zaire IID using this analysis(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>) (Fig S3). Similar to Zaire IID we observe a community of residues around the pocket. We also observe that this community is strongly connected to the green and orange communities that contain residues that interact with dsRNA indicating that the pocket opening could be affecting dsRNA binding in these homologs as well. Further, the differences in pocket opening have an interesting correspondence to the fact that Marburg prefers to bind the dsRNA backbone, while Reston and Zaire bind both blunt ends and the backbone. We therefore hypothesized that open pocket conformations preferentially bind the backbone while closed conformations preferentially bind blunt ends.</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<title>Thiol labeling experiments confirm Marburg has the highest probability of opening and Reston the lowest</title>
<p>As a first test of our computational predictions, we used thiol labeling to experimentally measure the probability that the cryptic pocket is open in each IID homolog. In these experiments, we measure the rate of covalent modification of a cysteine in the cryptic pocket, as we have done previously with Î²-lactamases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>) and Zaire IID (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>). In these experiments, 5,5â-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid), or DTNB, is added to the protein sample. In the presence of an oxidized (solvent exposed) thiol group of a cysteine residue, the disulfide bond between the two TNB molecules breaks, and one TNB molecule attaches to the cysteine via a disulfide bond. The free TNB molecule left from this reaction absorbs light at 412 nm. Therefore, when a cysteine buried inside a pocket is exposed to solvent as the pocket opens, we observe an exponential increase in absorbance at a rate that depends on the opening and closing rates of the pocket. We quantify this using the LinderstrÃ¸m-Lang model (see Materials and Methods). We focus on thiol labeling of cysteine 296 as its solvent exposure is correlated with the extent of pocket opening (as measured by the distance between residue 225 and 295) in our simulations (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3A, B</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">C</xref>), whereas the solvent exposures of other cysteines are not correlated with pocket opening (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3E, F</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">G</xref>, and Fig S4).</p>

</fig>
<p>As expected from the MSMs, we observe the highest probability of pocket opening in Marburg, followed by Zaire and Reston in that order. Thiol labeling of Reston IID and Marburg IID fit to one exponential per cysteine, each with the same amplitudes, indicating that all the cysteines in each variant get labeled (Fig S5). We performed point mutations of individual cysteines to serines to assign observed labeling rates to the cysteines as we have previously done for Zaire IID (Fig S6). We compare these results to the labeling rates we previously observed for Zaire (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>). The cysteines in Restonâs cryptic pocket label far more slowly than those in Zaire, while the labeling rates of the cysteines in Marburg are intermediate between Zaire and Reston (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3D</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">H</xref>). These data were fit to the LinderstrÃ¸m-Lang model (see Materials and Methods) to quantify the probability and kinetics of pocket opening (Supplementary Table 1). In all three homologs, C296 labels faster than expected from labeling of the unfolded fraction (Fig S7), suggesting that the pocket does exist in all three homologs. The equilibrium constants for C296 exposure (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn3">Eq 3</xref> in Materials and Methods) for Reston, Zaire and Marburg IIDs are 0.078 Â± 0.001, 0.413 Â± 0.009, 5.2 Â± 0.5. These correspond to probabilities of pocket opening of 0.072, 0.292, and 0.839 for Reston, Zaire, and Marburg, respectively. Therefore, in agreement with our computational prediction, we observe the highest probability of pocket opening in Marburg, followed by Zaire and Reston in that order.</p>

<title>Binding to different length RNAs suggests closed conformations preferentially bind dsRNA blunt ends while open conformations prefer binding the backbone</title>
<p>To test our prediction that more open homologs prefer the backbone while more closed ones preferentially bind the blunt ends, we used a fluorescence polarization assay to quantify the affinity of the homologs to different length dsRNA substrates, thereby varying the number of backbone binding sites available. Briefly, we use dsRNA labeled with fluorescein on one 5â end and titrate in varying concentrations of the proteins into a fixed concentration of the RNA (100 nM). Free RNA emits depolarized light upon excitation with polarized light due to its fast rotation whereas bound RNA emits polarized light. Recording the fluorescence polarization throughout the titration gives us the fraction of RNA bound to the protein. Particularly, we used a short 8bp RNA to get an accurate measure of binding to the blunt-ends and the same 8bp RNA with a 2 nucleotide overhang on the 3â ends to get an accurate measure of the binding to the backbone alone. Structural studies on these homologs suggest that the backbone binding mode has a footprint of 3 nucleotides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>). Previous RNA binding studies also suggest multiple IID molecules bind to each RNA molecule in solution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>). Therefore, we also performed measurements with a longer 25bp RNA with and without a 2 nucleotide overhang on the 3â ends to get an accurate measure of any cooperativity in the backbone binding. To accurately account for multiple protein molecules binding to a single molecule of dsRNA, we used a one-dimensional lattice binding model to fit the experimental data (see Materials and Methods). This model allows nearest neighbor cooperativity between all binding modes. Globally fitting these four binding curves for each homolog to this model (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4A, B</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">C</xref>) generates estimates for the equilibrium constant for opening the pocket (Fig S8A), the dissociation constants of the closed and open conformations to each site on the backbone <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="609218v4_inline1.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="609218v4_inline2.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> respectively), the dissociation constant of closed conformations to the blunt-end of the RNA <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="609218v4_inline3.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>, and the cooperativity between these interactions (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4D</xref> and Fig S8B).</p>

<p>In support of our proposed model, we find that the equilibrium constant for pocket opening (<italic>Koc</italic>, where oc stands for open vs closed) from our fits to dsRNA-binding data are in good agreement with those from our thiol labeling experiments <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="609218v4_inline4.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>. If the pocket opening observed in the thiol-labeling assays is the same conformational change affecting the RNA binding, we would expect the <italic>Koc</italic> obtained from the fits to be comparable to <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="609218v4_inline5.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>. Indeed, <italic>Koc</italic> for all three homologs obtained from the fits to the binding model agree very well with the equilibrium constant for the exposure of C296 (C307 in Zaire IID) obtained from the thiol labeling assay (Fig S8A).</p>
<p>In support of our hypothesis, our global fits show that the probability of pocket opening is the main difference between the variants. As described above, the equilibrium constants for pocket opening vary over a range of about 80-fold between the three homologs. In contrast, each of the dissociation constants between either open or closed protein and the blunt ends or backbone of dsRNA varies by no more than a factor of about 7-fold between the homologs. We also do not observe large differences in the magnitude of the cooperativity parameters between the homologs (Fig S8B). The interaction between the closed state and the blunt ends of dsRNA is far stronger than the interaction of either the closed state or the open state for the backbone (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4D</xref>). There is also negative cooperativity between two closed structures binding the backbone at adjacent positions (Fig S8B). As a result, homologs with low probabilities of pocket opening predominantly bind the blunt ends and their binding curves are left-shifted compared to more open homologs. Homologs with a higher probability of pocket opening are less likely to bind the blunt ends despite the high affinity of the closed state for blunt ends since the open state is incompatible with blunt end binding. The interaction between the open state and the backbone <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="609218v4_inline6.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> is about two orders of magnitude stronger than that of the closed state <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="609218v4_inline7.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> for all three homologs (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4D</xref>). There is also strong positive cooperativity between a protein in the open state binding the backbone alongside either a closed or open state (Fig S8B). As a result, homologs with high probabilities of pocket opening, like Marburg, predominantly bind the backbone and have right-shifted binding curves compared to more closed variants. Interestingly, most of the proteins that do bind the backbone are in the open state even for homologs where pocket opening is rare (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4E</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">F</xref>). For example, about 80% of the backbone is covered by Reston proteins in the open state even though the equilibrium constant for pocket opening (<italic>Koc</italic>) is 0.061 Â± 0.008, which corresponds to a probability of cryptic pocket opening of 0.057, the lowest of the three homologs. It is also noteworthy that crystal structures capture the closed state bound to the backbone but not the open state, suggesting that the crystallization conditions may shift the equilibrium in favor of the closed state.</p>

<title>Point mutations that alter the probability of pocket opening also induce differential binding to blunt ends versus the backbone</title>
<p>As a further test of our model, we next sought to identify point mutations that modulate the probability of pocket opening and assess if they have the expected impact on backbone versus blunt end binding. While the sequence of Marburg IID differs significantly from Reston and Zaire IIDs with a sequence identity of 42% and 45% respectively (Fig S1), the sequences of Reston and Zaire IID are 88% identical and 94% similar. Particularly, substitutions between these homologs are all distal to the RNA-binding interfaces and all the residues known to make contacts with dsRNA from structural studies are identical. Therefore, we reasoned that comparing these two homologs would help us identify minimal substitutions that control pocket opening probability and allow us to study its effect on dsRNA binding with minimal perturbation of other factors. Of these substitutions, one causes an interesting structural difference between Zaire and Reston IIDs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>). Residue P280 in Reston IID results in a formation of an alpha helix where an alanine in the same structural position (A291) in Zaire IID results in a disordered loop. This disordered loop forms a hinge that rotates as the pocket opens, and we reasoned this motion may be inhibited by the structure the proline induces in Reston. Therefore, we hypothesized that mutating the alanine in Zaire IID to a proline would result in a reduced probability of opening the pocket and a stronger preference for binding dsRNA blunt ends. This hypothesis is supported by our past work showing that the substitution A291P in Zaire IID reduces the probability of pocket opening(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>). Furthermore, we propose that mutating the proline in Reston to an alanine should increase the probability of pocket opening and enhance the binding to the dsRNA backbone.</p>
<p>As expected, introducing A291P into the Zaire IID leads to a reduced probability of pocket opening in both simulations and thiol labeling experiments, while introducing P280A into the Reston IID leads to an increased probability of pocket opening. FAST simulations performed on these variants indeed showed an increased probability of opening the pocket in Reston IID P280A and a decreased probability in Zaire IID A291P (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5A</xref>). The pocket also opens more widely in Reston IID P280A than Wild Type (WT) Reston IID. As before, examining the solvent exposure of the cysteines observed in simulation shows that while exposure of C296 (C307 in Zaire) is correlated with pocket opening, that of other cysteines is not Fig S9. We followed this up with the thiol labeling assay and assigned labeling rates to cysteines by labeling point mutations of individual cysteines to serines Fig S10. We observe that both cysteines in Reston IID P280A labeled faster than WT Reston IID (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5B</xref> and S11A). In comparison, both cysteines in Zaire IID A291P labeled slower compared to WT Zaire IID <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5B</xref> and S11B. Fits to the LinderstrÃ¸m-Lang model show a 26-fold increase the in the equilibrium constant for C296 exposure in Reston IID P280A compared to Reston IID WT and a 36-fold decrease in Zaire IID A291P compared to Zaire IID WT (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5B</xref>). We observed only moderate differences in the stability of Reston IID WT and Reston IID P280A under urea denaturation (Fig S7). Taken together, this indicates that the mutation modulates pocket opening without significantly impacting the stability of the protein.</p>

</fig>
<p>In further support of our model, the point mutation that increases Restonâs probability of pocket opening also shifts the protein towards backbone binding while the mutation that reduces the probability of pocket opening in Zaire shifts the balance towards blunt end binding. We performed fluorescence polarization binding experiments to the four RNA substrates we used for the WT homologs (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6A-D</xref>). We analyzed these experiments using global fits of the binding of each mutant to all four RNAs to the one-dimensional lattice model described for the WT homologs (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6A-D</xref> and Fig S12). Importantly, the equilibrium constants for pocket opening (<italic>Koc</italic>) obtained from the fits to the binding model continue to agree very well with the equilibrium constants for the exposure of C296 obtained from the thiol labeling assay (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6E</xref>). While there are large differences between the equilibrium constant for pocket opening amongst these variants, the rest of the fit parameters are very similar to those from the WT proteins. We observe that the dissociation constant of the closed conformations to each site on the backbone <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="609218v4_inline8.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> is two orders of magnitude weaker than that of the open conformations <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="609218v4_inline9.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> for the mutants as well (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6F</xref>), further increasing our confidence in the model. We do not observe large differences in the magnitude of the binding and cooperativity parameters between the WTs and the mutants except for the cooperativity between two neighboring molecules in the open state binding to the backbone Ï<italic>oo</italic> <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig (6F, G</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">H</xref>). This parameter seems to buffer the effect of the increased affinity of the open state to the backbone. This inherent trade-off also suggests that shifting the equilibrium too drastically in favor of the open conformation would not be beneficial for binding to the backbone. Particularly, Reston P280A is more open than WT Reston, but its binding curves for the overhang substrates are right-shifted compared to WT. This suggests that though the open pocket conformations bind better to the backbone, increasing the fraction of open conformation in solution has a negative effect on the overall backbone binding. To understand this, we calculated the fraction of the RNA backbone covered by the open and closed states of the various homologs and mutants for different lengths of RNA based on the binding parameters obtained from the fit (Fig S13). We see that in all cases, a much larger proportion of the backbone is covered by the open states than by the closed states. This suggests that while it is necessary to have some ability to open the pocket, increasing the probability of opening has no added benefit for backbone binding. Meanwhile, Zaire A291P is more closed and prefers to bind the blunt ends more than the WT protein. This is reflected by its binding curve for the blunt ended substrates being left-shifted compared to WT. Overall, these results show a strong correspondence between the probability of pocket opening and the relative affinities of the VP35 IID for different binding sites on dsRNA.</p>

<title>Conclusion and Discussion</title>
<p>We have shown that the opening and closing of a cryptic pocket in VP35 toggles the protein between two different dsRNA binding modes. Specifically, we have shown that VP35 preferentially binds the blunt ends of dsRNA when the cryptic pocket is closed but preferentially binds the backbone when the pocket is open. As a result, variants where the pocket tends to be closed are better at blocking RIG-I from binding dsRNA, whereas VP35 variants that are open more often are better at blocking MDA5. This model explains differences in the RNA binding behaviors of the Zaire, Reston, and Marburg variants of VP35 that were difficult to explain based on crystal structures of the proteins. Moreover, it predicts how point mutations that alter the probability of cryptic pocket opening will alter the relative affinity of a VP35 protein for the backbone versus the blunt ends of dsRNA. More importantly, cryptic pockets are not just happenstance, as they can have a functional role. This finding suggests that cryptic pockets are under selective pressure. As a result, it shouldnât be trivial for viruses or cells to evolve resistance to drugs that target cryptic pockets by acquiring mutations that prevent pocket opening. Future studies on other proteins will help to establish if these findings are generally true or are limited to a subset of cryptic pockets. In the meantime, efforts to target the cryptic pocket in VP35 are warranted given the evidence that this pocket has a functional role that should prevent Zaire ebolavirus from acquiring mutations that give rise to drug resistance by preventing the pocket from opening.</p>

We calculated the Solvent Accessible Surface Area (SASA) of all atoms in each frame using a 2.8Ã probe. We summed up the SASA of all the atoms of the sidechain of each residue and clustered this sidechain SASA using kcenters upto a cluster radius of 3.5 nm<sup>2</sup> for Reston IID and 2.7 nm<sup>2</sup> for Marburg IID followed by five rounds of kmedoids. We then built Markov State Models (MSMs) at multiple lagtimes and used the implied timescales test (Fig S2) to decide on a 6ns lagtime for the final MSMs of all homologs.</p>

<title>Analysis of dsRNA binding experiments</title>
<p>To obtain the contributions from the end-binding and backbone-binding to the increase in anisotropy observed in the fluorescence polarization experiments, we used a one-dimensional lattice model for proteins competing to bind to nucleic acids. Here we consider our labeled dsRNA to be the macromolecule and the IIDs to be the ligands. Specifically, our model has the open and the closed conformations of the IIDs competing for binding to the dsRNA. The total concentration of the ligand is known for every point in the titration and relates to the relative concentration of the open and the closed states as:

<p>To treat the simplest case first, we assume that only the closed state binds to the ends of the dsRNA. We refer to the intrinsic association constant for this interaction as <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="609218v4_inline10.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>. We assume that the open and closed states bind to the dsRNA backbone with intrinsic association constants <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="609218v4_inline11.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="609218v4_inline12.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>.</p>
<p>We performed the fits at varying binding site sizes for the three interactions described above. Specifically, we varied the end binding site size between 1-8 nucleotides and the backbone binding site sizes between 3-8 nucleotides, choosing the lower limits in both cases to be the binding site size observed in the available crystal structures. We analyzed the sum of the residuals squared obtained from these fits across all five variants used in this study to obtain the binding site sizes that produce the best fit (Fig S14). This analysis showed that the best fit was obtained for the blunt end and both backbone binding site sizes all being 3 nucleotides each.</p>
<p>Using a threshold of 5 times the minimum sum of the residuals squared, we note that binding site sizes ranging from 1-4 nucleotides for the end binding, 3-5 nucleotides for the closed state binding to the backbone, and 3-4 nucleotides for the open state binding to the end produce comparable fits.</p>
<p>Further, we found that the major conclusions of the study hold true for varying binding site sizes in this range (Fig S15-18). Future RNA binding studies with a technique with a higher sensitivity for binding site sizes will help in confidently estimating these parameters.</p>

<p>The first is to account for the fact that the bulk concentrations of the ligand species in our system are not independent. In the model, the statistical weight for the binding of ligand of type <italic>s</italic> is given by <italic>csKs</italic> where <italic>cs</italic> is the bulk concentration of the ligand and <italic>Ks</italic> is its intrinsic association constant. In our system, the bulk concentrations of the ligands are the concentration of the open and closed conformations of the protein. These concentrations are related as shown in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn4">equations (4)</xref> and <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn5">(5)</xref>. Therefore, the statistical weights for each of the interactions in our system are given by <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="609218v4_inline13.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> where,
<disp-formula id="eqn10">
<graphic xlink:href="609218v4_eqn10.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
<disp-formula id="eqn11">
<graphic xlink:href="609218v4_eqn11.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
<disp-formula id="eqn12">
<graphic xlink:href="609218v4_eqn12.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
</p>
<p>The second change we need to make is to account for the fact that end-binding can only occur at nucleotides <italic>i</italic> = 1 <italic>or N</italic> â¢ <italic>Nend</italic> + 1, where <italic>Nend</italic> is the end binding site size. Therefore, the value of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="609218v4_inline14.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> given by <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn12">equation (12)</xref> is only included in transfer matrices for nucleotides 1 <italic>or N</italic> â¢ <italic>Nend</italic> + 1 and we set <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="609218v4_inline15.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> for all other nucleotides.</p>
<p>Further, we allow cooperativity between all binding modes denoted by the constants Ï<italic>ss</italic>â² where <italic>s</italic> and <italic>s</italic>â² can be 1,2 <italic>or</italic> 3 denoting the open state binding to the backbone, closed state binding to the backbone and the closed state binding to the ends respectively. For example, the cooperativity between one closed conformation binding to the backbone and an open conformation binding to the backbone to its right is given by Ï<sub>12</sub>. For ease of understanding we refer to ligand types s = 1,2 and 3 as o, c and e in the text. Therefore, the cooperativity between one closed conformation binding to the backbone and an open conformation binding to the backbone to its right is given by Ï<sub><italic>co</italic></sub>. Examples of these statistical weights are shown in Fig S19.</p>
<p>With these statistical weights, we construct the transfer matrices for each nucleotide <italic>i</italic> as below, with <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="609218v4_inline16.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> for all nucleotides other than 1 and <italic>N</italic> â¢ <italic>Nend</italic> + 1.
<disp-formula id="ueqn3">
<graphic xlink:href="609218v4_ueqn3.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
</p>
<p>We use these to calculate the probability, <italic>ps</italic>(<italic>i</italic>), that a base-pair <italic>i</italic> is occupied by a ligand of type <italic>s</italic> given by <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn9">equation (9)</xref>.</p>
<p>From this, we calculate the average probability of the backbone being bound as
<disp-formula id="eqn13">
<graphic xlink:href="609218v4_eqn13.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
and the average probability of the ends being bound as
<disp-formula id="eqn14">
<graphic xlink:href="609218v4_eqn14.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
</p>
<p>We then convert this average probability to observed anisotropy (<italic>robs</italic>) as follows:
<disp-formula id="eqn15">
<graphic xlink:href="609218v4_eqn15.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
</p>
<p>Where, <italic>ro</italic> is the anisotropy of the free RNA.</p>
<disp-quote>
<p><inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="609218v4_inline17.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> is the maximum anisotropy for blunt-end binding,</p>
<p><inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="609218v4_inline18.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> is the maximum anisotropy for backbone binding,</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Here, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="609218v4_inline19.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="609218v4_inline20.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> are parameters obtained from the fit and are shown Fig S20.</p>
<p>Fits were performed using Scipy 1.8.0, NumPy 1.22.2 and lmfit 1.2.2.</p>

<p>This study provides <bold>important</bold> insights into how cryptic pockets play a role in shaping binding preferences of protein-nucleic acid interactions. By combining biochemical assays and state-of-the-art molecular dynamics simulations, mechanism underlying viral protein 35 (VP35) homologs to bind the backbone of double stranded RNA is presented. The evidence is <bold>compelling</bold> for molecular determinants that suggest two different dsRNA binding modes for VP35 and also underscores the evolutionary importance of these pockets.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Mallimadugula et al. combined Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations, thiol-labeling experiments, and RNA-binding assays to study and compare the RNA-binding behavior of the Interferon Inhibitory Domain (IID) from Viral Protein 35 (VP35) of Zaire ebolavirus, Reston ebolavirus, and Marburg marburgvirus. Although the structures and sequences of these viruses are similar, the authors suggest that differences in RNA binding stem from variations in their intrinsic dynamics, particularly the opening of a cryptic pocket. More precisely, the dynamics of this pocket may influence whether the IID binds to RNA blunt ends or the RNA backbone.</p>
<p>Overall, the authors present important findings to reveal how the intrinsic dynamics of proteins can influence their binding to molecules and, hence, their functions. They have used extensive biased simulations to characterize the opening of a pocket which was not clearly seen in experimental results - at least when the proteins were in their unbound forms. Biochemical assays further validated theoretical results and linked them to RNA binding modes. Thus, with the combination of biochemical assays and state-of-the-art Molecular Dynamics simulations, these results are clearly compelling.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The use of extensive Adaptive Sampling combined with biochemical assays clearly point to the opening of the Interferon Inhibitory Domain (IID) as a factor for RNA binding. This type of approach is especially useful to assess how protein dynamics can affect its function.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Although a connection between the cryptic pocket dynamics and RNA binding mode is proposed, the precise molecular mechanism linking pocket opening to RNA binding still remains unclear.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors aimed to determine whether a cryptic pocket in the VP35 protein of Zaire ebolavirus has a functional role in RNA binding and, by extension, in immune evasion. They sought to address whether this pocket could be an effective therapeutic target resistant to evolutionary evasion by studying its role in dsRNA binding among different filovirus VP35 homologs. Through simulations and experiments, they demonstrated that cryptic pocket dynamics modulate the RNA binding modes, directly influencing how VP35 variants block RIG-I and MDA5-mediated immune responses.</p>
<p>
The authors successfully achieved their aim, showing that the cryptic pocket is not a random structural feature but rather an allosteric regulator of dsRNA binding. Their results not only explain functional differences in VP35 homologs despite their structural similarity but also suggest that targeting this cryptic pocket may offer a viable strategy for drug development with reduced risk of resistance.</p>
<p>This work represents a significant advance in the field of viral immunoevasion and therapeutic targeting of traditionally &quot;undruggable&quot; protein features. By demonstrating the functional relevance of cryptic pockets, the study challenges long-standing assumptions and provides a compelling basis for exploring new drug discovery strategies targeting these previously overlooked regions.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The combination of molecular simulations and experimental approaches is a major strength, enabling the authors to connect structural dynamics with functional outcomes. The use of homologous VP35 proteins from different filoviruses strengthens the study's generality, and the incorporation of point mutations adds mechanistic depth. Furthermore, the ability to reconcile functional differences that could not be explained by crystal structures alone highlights the utility of dynamic studies in uncovering hidden allosteric features.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>While the methodology is robust, certain limitations should be acknowledged. For example, the study would benefit from a more detailed quantitative analysis of how specific mutations impact RNA binding and cryptic pocket dynamics, as this could provide greater mechanistic insight. This study would also benefit from providing a clear rationale for the selection of the amber03 force field and considering the inclusion of volume-based approaches for pocket analysis. Such revisions will strengthen the robustness and impact of the study.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors suggest a mechanism that explains the preference of</p>
<p>
viral protein 35 (VP35) homologs to bind the backbone of double stranded RNA versus blunt ends. These preferences have a biological impact in terms of the ability of different viruses to escape the immune response of the host.</p>
<p>
The proposed mechanism involves the existence of a cryptic pocket, where VP35 binds the blunt ends of dsRNA when the cryptic pocket is closed and preferentially binds the RNA double stranded backbone when the pocket is open.</p>
<p>
The authors performed MD simulation results, thiol labelling experiments, fluorescence polarization assays, as well as point mutations to support their hypothesis.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This is a genuinely interesting scientific questions, which is approached through multiple complementary experiments as well as extensive MD simulations. Moreover, structural biology studies focused on RNA-protein interactions are particularly rare, highlighting the importance of further research in this area.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>- Sequence similarity between Ebola-Zaire (94% similarity) explains their similar behaviour in simulations and experimental assays. Marburg instead is a more distant homolog (~80% similarity relative to Ebola/Zaire). This difference is sequence and structure can explain the propensities, without the need to involve the existence of a cryptic pocket.</p>
<p>
- No real evidence for the presence of a cryptic pocket is presented, but rather a distance probability distribution between two residues obtained from extensive MD simulations. It would be interesting to characterise the modelled RNA-protein interface in more detail</p>
<p>Comments on revisions:</p>
<p>-I still think that the term cryptic pocket is misleading here, unless the cryptic pocket is more thoroughly characterised. I would find it more appropriate to use the term open/closed state.</p>
<p>- Mg ions are known to be crucial in stabilising RNA structure both in vitro and in MD simulations (see e.g. Draper BJ 2008 and many others). While I understand that the authors cannot repeat simulations in presence of ions, I believe that this detail should be more clearly detailed in the manuscript.</p>

Through simulations and experiments, they demonstrated that cryptic pocket dynamics modulate the RNA binding modes, directly influencing how VP35 variants block RIG-I and MDA5-mediated immune responses.</p>
<p>The authors successfully achieved their aim, showing that the cryptic pocket is not a random structural feature but rather an allosteric regulator of dsRNA binding. Their results not only explain functional differences in VP35 homologs despite their structural similarity but also suggest that targeting this cryptic pocket may offer a viable strategy for drug development with reduced risk of resistance.</p>
<p>This work represents a significant advance in the field of viral immunoevasion and therapeutic targeting of traditionally &quot;undruggable&quot; protein features. By demonstrating the functional relevance of cryptic pockets, the study challenges long-standing assumptions and provides a compelling basis for exploring new drug discovery strategies targeting these previously overlooked regions.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The combination of molecular simulations and experimental approaches is a major strength, enabling the authors to connect structural dynamics with functional outcomes. The use of homologous VP35 proteins from different filoviruses strengthens the study's generality, and the incorporation of point mutations adds mechanistic depth. Furthermore, the ability to reconcile functional differences that could not be explained by crystal structures alone highlights the utility of dynamic studies in uncovering hidden allosteric features.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>While the methodology is robust, certain limitations should be acknowledged. For example, the study would benefit from a more detailed quantitative analysis of how specific mutations impact RNA binding and cryptic pocket dynamics, as this could provide greater mechanistic insight. This study would also benefit from providing a clear rationale for the selection of the amber03 force field and considering the inclusion of volume-based approaches for pocket analysis. Such revisions will strengthen the robustness and impact of the study.</p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors suggest a mechanism that explains the preference of viral protein 35 (VP35) homologs to bind the backbone of double-stranded RNA versus blunt ends. These preferences have a biological impact in terms of the ability of different viruses to escape the immune response of the host.</p>
<p>The proposed mechanism involves the existence of a cryptic pocket, where VP35 binds the blunt ends of dsRNA when the cryptic pocket is closed and preferentially binds the RNA double-stranded backbone when the pocket is open.</p>
<p>The authors performed MD simulation results, thiol labelling experiments, fluorescence polarization assays, as well as point mutations to support their hypothesis.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This is a genuinely interesting scientific question, which is approached through multiple complementary experiments as well as extensive MD simulations. Moreover, structural biology studies focused on RNA-protein interactions are particularly rare, highlighting the importance of further research in this area.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>- Sequence similarity between Ebola-Zaire (94% similarity) explains their similar behaviour in simulations and experimental assays. Marburg instead is a more distant homolog (~80% similarity relative to Ebola/Zaire). This difference is sequence and structure can explain the propensities, without the need to involve the existence of a cryptic pocket.</p>
<p>- No real evidence for the presence of a cryptic pocket is presented, but rather a distance probability distribution between two residues obtained from extensive MD simulations. It would be interesting to characterise the modelled RNA-protein interface in more detail</p>
<p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p>
<p>Before assessing the overall quality and significance of this work, this reviewer needs to specify the context of this review. This reviewer's expertise lies in biased and unbiased molecular dynamics simulations and structural biology. Hence, while this reviewer can overall understand the results for thiol-labeling and RNA-binding assays, this review will not assess the quality of these biochemical assays and will mainly focus on the modelling results.</p>
<p>Overall, the authors present important findings to reveal how the intrinsic dynamics of proteins can influence their binding to molecules and, hence, their functions. They have used extensive biased simulations to characterize the opening of a pocket which was not clearly seen in experimental results - at least when the proteins were in their unbound forms. Biochemical assays further validated theoretical results and linked them to RNA binding modes. Thus, with the combination of biochemical assays and state-of-the-art Molecular Dynamics simulations, these results are clearly compelling.</p>
<p>Beyond the clear qualities of this work, I would like to mention a few points that may help to better contextualize and rationalize the results presented here.</p>
<p>- First, both the introduction and discussion sections seem relatively condensed. Extending them to, for example, better describe the methodological context and discuss the methodological limitations and potential future developments related to biased simulations may help the reader get a better idea of the significance of this work.</p>
<p>- The authors presented 3 homologs in this study: IIDs of Reston, Zaire, and Marburg viruses. While Zaire and Reston are relatively similar in terms of sequence (Figure S1). The sequences clearly differ between Marburg and the two other viruses. Can the author indicate a similarity/identity score for each sequence alignment and extend Figure S1 to really compare Marburg sequence with Reston and Zaire? Can they also discuss how these differences may impact the comparison of the three IIDs? This may also help the reader to understand why sometimes the authors compare the three viruses and why sometimes they are focusing only on comparing Zaire and Reston.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We would like to thank the reviewer for raising this point and we agree that additional details about the sequence comparison provide more context for the choices of substitutions we made. Therefore, we have updated Fig S1 to include a detailed pairwise comparison of all the IID sequences including the percentage sequence similarity and identity. We have also added the following sentences to the results section where we first introduced the substitutions between Zaire and Reston IIDs</p>
<p>âWhile the sequence of Marburg IID differs significantly from Reston and Zaire IIDs with a sequence identity of 42% and 45% respectively (Fig S1), the sequences of Reston and Zaire IID are 88% identical and 94% similar. Particularly, substitutions between these homologs are all distal to the RNA-binding interfaces and all the residues known to make contacts with dsRNA from structural studies are identical. Therefore, we reasoned that comparing these two homologs would help us identify minimal substitutions that control pocket opening probability and allow us to study its effect on dsRNA binding with minimal perturbation of other factors.â</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>- In this work, the authors mentioned the cryptic pocket but only illustrated the opening of this pocket by using a simple distance between residues (Figure 2) and a SASA of one cysteine (Figure 3). In previous work done by the authors (Cruz et al. , Nature Communications, 2022), they better characterized residues involved in RNA binding and forming the cryptic pocket. Thus, would it be possible to better described this cryptic pocket (residues involved, volume, etc ..) and better explain how, structurally speaking, it can affect RNA binding mode (blunt ends vs backbone) ?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out the need for clarification on the residues involved in RNA binding and pocket opening and the mechanism linking them. We have performed the CARDS analysis on Reston and Marburg IID simulations as we had done on Zaire IID simulations in Cruz et al, 2022. The results are shown in Fig S3 and discussed in the main text in the first results section.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>- As a counter-example, the authors used C315 for SASA calculation and thiol labeling (Figure 3). This cysteine is mainly buried as seen by SASA for Reston and Marburg and thiol labelling (Figure 3 E,G,H). Would it be possible to also get thiol labeling rates for Cystein 264 in Reston and its equivalent to see a case where the residue is solvent exposed?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have shown the SASA for C264 from the simulations in Fig S4 and the thiol labeling rates for all 4 cysteines in Reston IID in Fig S6. Comparing these rates to the rates of all 4 cysteines obtained for Zaire IID (Fig 4 in Cruz et Al, 2022), we observe that the rates for C264, which is expected to be exposed are significantly faster than those of C315 which is largely buried in all variants.</p>

<p>- I strongly support here the will of the authors to share their data by depositing them in an OSF repository. These data help this reviewer to assess some of the results produced by the authors and help to better understand the dynamics of their respective systems. I have just a few comments that need to be addressed regarding these data: o While there are data for WT Reston and Marburg, there is no data for Zaire. Is this because these data correspond to the previous work (Cruz et al. 2022) (in this case, it would be good to make this clear in the main text) or is it an omission? o There is no center.xtc file in the Marburg-MSM directory o There is no protmasses.pdb in the Reston-MSM directory</p>
<p>- In general, if possible, it would be good to use the same name for each type of file presented in each directory to help a potential user understand a bit more how to use these data.</p>
<p>- If possible, adding a bit more of metadata and explanations on the OSF webpage would be very beneficial to help find these data. To help in this direction, the authors may have a look to the guidelines presented at the end of this article: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/90061">https://elifesciences.org/articles/90061</ext-link></p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out the omissions from the OSF repository. We have added the missing files and followed a uniform naming convention. We have also added documentation in the metadata section of the OSF repository to help others use the data.</p>
<p>Indeed, the simulation data used for Zaire IID is available on the OSF repository corresponding to Cruz et al. 2022 at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://osf.io/5pg2a">https://osf.io/5pg2a</ext-link>. We have also clarified this in the data availability section of the main text.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Minor point:</p>
<p>In Figure 2, there is a slight bump for the 225-295 distance around 1 nm for Reston. Can the author comment it ? As these results are based on long AS, even if very small, do the authors think this population is significant?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Comparing the probability distributions obtained from bootstrapping the frames used to calculate the MSM equilibrium probabilities (Revised Fig1), we observe that the bump for the Reston IID distribution is persistent in all bootstraps indicating that it might indeed be significant. This is also consistent with our observation that the cysteine 296 does get fully labeled in our thiol labeling experiments, albeit significantly slowly compared to the other homologs.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p>
<p>I recommend that the authors implement moderate revisions prior to the publication of this research article, addressing the identified weaknesses (see below).</p>
<p>The authors should provide a rationale for their selection of the amber03 force field (Duan et al., JCTC 24, 1999-2012, 2003) for molecular dynamics simulations, particularly given the availability of more recent and optimized versions of the AMBER force fields. These newer force fields may offer improved parameterization for biomolecular systems, potentially enhancing the accuracy and reliability of the simulation results.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We chose the Amber03 force field because it has performed well in much of our past work, including the original prediction of the cryptic pocket that we study in this manuscript. The results presented in this manuscript also demonstrate the predictive power of Amber03.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Additionally, while the authors utilized solvent-accessible surface area (SASA) for cryptic pocket analysis, volume-based approaches may be more suitable for this purpose. Several studies (e.g., Sztain et al. J. Chem. Inf. Model. 2021, 61, 7, 3495-3501) have demonstrated the utility of volume analysis in identifying and characterizing cryptic pockets. The authors could consider incorporating such methodologies to provide a more comprehensive assessment of pocket dynamics.</p>
<p>The authors propose that the cryptic pocket is not merely a random structural feature but functions as an allosteric regulator of dsRNA binding. To further substantiate this claim, an in-depth analysis of this allosteric effect using for instance network analysis could significantly enhance the study. Such an approach could identify key residues and interaction networks within the protein that mediate the allosteric regulation. This type of mechanistic insight would not only provide a stronger theoretical framework but also offer valuable information for the rational design of therapeutic interventions targeting the cryptic pocket.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out the need for clarification on the molecular mechanism linking the opening of the cryptic pocket to RNA binding. We have performed the CARDS analysis on Reston and Marburg IID simulations as was done on Zaire IID simulations in Cruz et al, 2022. The results are shown in Fig S3 and discussed in the main text in the first results section. Briefly, we do find a community (blue) comprising the pocket residues in Reston and Marburg IIDs as we did in Zaire. Similarly, we find that many of the RNA binding residues fall into the orange and green communities as in Zaire. However, there are differences in exactly which residues are clustered into which of these two communities. There are also differences in how strongly connected these communities are in the three homologs. Therefore, while we can conclude that pocket residues likely have varying influence on the RNA binding residues in the homologs, it is hard to say exactly what that variation is from this analysis alone.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p>
<p>- MD simulations: All simulations were initialised from the 3 crystal structures, is it correct? In all cases, RNA ds was not included in simulations, right? Were crystallographic MG ions in the vicinity of the binding site included? these are known to influence structural dynamics to a large extent.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>All simulations were indeed initialized using only protein atoms from the crystal structures 3FKE, 4GHL, and 3L2A. Therefore, crystallographic Mg ions were not included in the simulations. However, we do agree with the reviewer and think that the effect of parameters such as salt concentration, specifically Mg ions which are known to be important for the stability of dsRNA, on the pocket opening equilibrium merits detailed study in future work.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>- Figure 2: Would it be possible to perform e.g. a block error analysis and show the statistical errors of the distributions?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree that showing the statistical variation in the MSM equilibrium probabilities is important for comparing the different distributions. Therefore, we have updated Figs 2 and 5 to show the distributions obtained from MSMs constructed using 100 and 10 random samples of the data respectively to indicate the extent of the statistical variability in the MSM construction.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>- More detailed structural biology experiments (such as NMR or HDX-MS) could potentially shed more light on the differential behaviour of the three different homologs, providing more evidence for the presence of the cryptic pocket.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree that NMR and HDX-MS are powerful means to study dynamics and are actively exploring these approaches for our future work.</p>
