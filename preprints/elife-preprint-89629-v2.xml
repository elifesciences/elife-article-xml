<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Dendritic action potentials exhibit long plateaus of many tens of milliseconds, outliving axonal spikes by an order of magnitude. The computational role of these slow events seems at odds with the need to rapidly integrate and relay information throughout large nervous systems. We propose that the timescale of dendritic potentials allows for reliable integration of asynchronous inputs. We develop a physiologically grounded model in which the extended duration of dendritic spikes equips each dendrite with a resettable memory of incoming signals. This provides a tractable model for capturing dendritic nonlinearities observed in experiments and in more complex, detailed models. Using this model, we show that long-lived, nonlinear dendritic plateau potentials allow neurons to spike reliably when confronted with asynchronous input spikes. We demonstrate this model supports non-trivial computations in a network solving an association/discrimination task using sparse spiking that is subject to timing jitter. This demonstrates a computational role for the specific time-course of dendritic potentials in situations where decisions occur quickly, reliably, and with a low number of spikes. Our results provide empirically testable hypotheses for the role of dendritic action potentials in cortical function as well as a potential bio-inspired means of realising neuromorphic spiking computations in analog hardware.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Across species, many types of neurons possess active dendrites that produce nonlinear responses to synaptic input [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>]. The computational role of these nonlinearities is diverse and likely impacts the function of the wider neural circuit they inhabit. Some of the most intensely studied examples of dendritic excitability are found in cortical excitatory neurons, which produce regenerative dendritic potentials – ‘dendritic spikes’ – in response to excitatory synaptic drive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>].</p>
<p>Dendritic spikes in excitatory cortical neurons last for many tens of milliseconds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>]. This timescale is conspicuous, being many times longer than the fastest signalling processes in the nervous systems, including Excitatory Post-Synaptic Potentials (EPSPs) and axonal spikes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). Reconciling the relatively slow time course of dendritic potentials with rapid signalling and computation therefore poses a challenge, particularly when such computations may involve relaying information over multiple brain areas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref>]. Furthermore, the duration of dendritic events incurs heavy energetic costs, because dendritic currents contribute significantly to the ATP budget of the brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>]. What computational benefit might justify these signalling and metabolic costs?</p>

<p>We propose that the duration and threshold-like properties of dendritic currents support robust computation in the face of spike timing jitter by holding a trace of recent inputs. This is especially relevant to integration of inputs during high conductance states that are prevalent in vivo, where a typical neuron receives significant synaptic drive. In these states, the effective membrane time constant can be extremely short, and varies substantially depending on synaptic input [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>]. As a consequence, computations that rely on passive summation of multiple inputs would place strong constraints on spike timing precision. Dendritic action potentials, by contrast, have a consistently long durations that are ensured by the gating properties of voltage gated ion channels and NMDA receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>]. These properties are largely determined by the amino acid sequence of receptor and channel proteins that are expressed in dendrites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>]. Dendritic properties thus appear to be specifically tuned at the molecular and genetic level to produce localized, suprathreshold events that outlive rapid membrane fluctuations.</p>
<p>Numerous studies point out that nonlinear summation in dendrites can make neurons computationally equivalent to entire networks of simplified point models, or ‘units’ in a traditional neural network [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>]. Other work has shown that the dynamic properties of dendritic action potentials enrich computational and signal processing capacity by providing additional long timescales over which input-driven membrane potential or synapse dynamics evolve [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>]. These ideas and the specific examples that support them are complementary to what we are proposing here. With the dendritic potential as a backbone, our work adds to the computational repertoire by allowing neurons to achieve robust computation even when there is high variability in the arrival times of inputs.</p>
<p>We extract core features of the biophysics of dendritic integration to construct and analyze a simplified model. With this model we demonstrate that rapid computation remains possible – and is in fact facilitated – by dendritic transients that exceed the integration time constant of single neurons. This idea is not in conflict with other hypothesized functions of dendritic transients, including the induction of synaptic plasticity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>]. The extent of interaction between plasticity and the mechanism we propose here is thus an important question for future work. We focus on computations that take place on the most rapid timescale, because short integration windows are necessarily more sensitive to timing jitter.</p>
<p>A side product of our analysis is the interpretation of rapid cortical computations as being binary in nature, with each neuron participating with at most one spike per computation. A number of studies find empirical evidence for such an operating regime in different parts of the nervous system, such as sensory decision making in complex visual and auditory scenes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref>]. Within this operating regime, and possibly more generally, we show how dendritic potentials allow non-trivial, robust and rapid spiking computations at a network level. Our work therefore suggests that long-lived dendritic potentials can paradoxically assist in the most rapid computations possible in a spiking network.</p>

<title>Abstract model</title>
<p>Key features of NMDA action currents are their long duration and their super-linear integration of inputs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>]. Fig- ure 2A and B show a recording of an NMDA spike from a cortical neuron in a rat, from [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>]. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>] triggered an NMDA spike by glutamate micro iontophoresis while recording at the soma and the indicated (red, blue) sites in the dendrite. The voltage response (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>) reveals the orders-of-magnitude difference in timescale of an NMDA spike (left) compared to a sodium action potential in the soma (right). We took their extensive biophysical computational model (85 compartments, 439 segments—for details see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>] and subsection 3.1) and simulated glutamate releases 50 ms apart in the three dendritic sites indicated in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>, thereby triggering three NMDA spikes at those sites, analogous to the experiment of [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>]. Despite these dendritic spikes being initiated at different times, they still sum in the soma, leading to a sodium action potential there (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>We developed an abstract model of these NMDA spikes to capture the essence of their role in circuit computations and for computational expediency. The model consists of a somatic compartment coupled passively to multiple dendritic compartments, each of which corresponds to a single branch on the dendritic tree (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>; for details see subsection 3.2). We model NMDA spikes by thresholding the voltage of a leaky dendritic compartment. When the dendritic voltage exceeds threshold it remains depolarized for some time before returning to rest (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>). The voltage dynamics are thus parametrised by the threshold and duration of the NMDA spike. We refer to this behavior as “Leaky Integrate-and-Hold” (LIH). It captures the salient features of the NMDA spikes, namely the threshold plus saturation of the super-linear integration, and the long-lived plateau of the dendritic voltage.</p>
<p>Due to passive coupling between compartments in the model, excitation in the dendrites depolarises the soma membrane potential, potentially leading to “axonal” output spikes. We do not model an axonal compartment; instead we implement standard leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) dynamics in the somatic compartment. A detailed description of the model, along with links to code, is provided in the methods.</p>
<p>We compared the behaviour of our simplified model with that of the full, detailed biophysical model of <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C,D</xref>. The plateau potentials in the abstract model have a qualitatively similar effect on somatic membrane potential as the NMDA spikes in the biophysical model: <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>, top, shows that spikes arriving at different times are summed in an integrate and hold-like manner.</p>
<p>We compared this to a situation where all inputs arrive at a soma with standard LIF dynamics and a 10 ms membrane time constant. This time constant is consistent with the high-conductance state of pyramidal neurons in the cortex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>]: inputs decay after 2–3 ms, and fail to sum to spike threshold (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>, lower).</p>
<p>To partially account for effects of inhibition, we assessed the robustness of dendritic plateaus to tonic inhibitory conductance. As can be seen in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2G</xref>, dendritic plateaus survive inhibitory conductance up to values where the total conductance is roughly equal (see also [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>]). Thus, to a crude approximation, dendritic potentials provide an integrate-and-hold mechanism that could function e.g. in the balanced regime observed in cortical circuits. In the present study we did not attempt to account for temporal variation in inhibition, which will likely play a role in providing further spike synchrony, among other things. This is an important issue for future work. In the scope of what remains here we want to ask if Leaky-Integrate-and-Hold (LIH) can easily and plausibly facilitate network computations with spikes.</p>

<title>Single Neurons Struggle to Integrate Asynchronous Spikes</title>
<p>The simplified model captures a key feature of the detailed biophysics of pyramidal neuron dendrites: the ability to integrate and hold inputs for a duration exceeding the membrane time constant. We hypothesized that this feature would be useful in situations where neurons need to integrate asynchronous input and reliably threshold it despite fluctuations in arrival times of the input.</p>
<p>In effect, each dendrite is performing a binary classification on its inputs. If input spikes arrive in a narrow time window, reliably integrating them is trivial (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A,B</xref> left). However, millisecond-scale synchrony is unlikely in a large network that is subject to uncertainty and noise. Empirically, spike timing jitter is commonly observed at the population level.</p>
<fig id="fig3" position="float" fig-type="figure">
<label>Figure 3:</label>
<caption><p><bold>(A)</bold> Neurons integrate inputs and compare the result to a firing threshold, which is comparable to performing a binary classification. When inputs are synchronous this can be done with a low number of spikes (left). But when spike timing is unpredictable (middle), this falls apart. Extended depolarizing potentials within dendritic compartments acts as a hold mechanism, allowing asynchronous events from different compartments to summate (right). <bold>(B)</bold> Simulation of summed voltage for 10 dendritic compartments, for small amounts of input-event timing jitter (on the order of one EPSP duration <italic>τ ∼</italic> 10 ms; left), and larger amounts jitter (10<italic>τ</italic>, middle). Increased jitter increases the variability of the net depolarization. Extended depolarizing potentials on the duration of <italic>∼</italic> 20 ms reduce the variability in net depolarization. Voltage values were normalized by dividing by the maximum of the mean, and the shaded are shows the inner 90% of the resulting distribution of the voltage. <bold>(C)</bold> Increased jitter in the timing of input events reduces the net summed depolarization. <bold>(D)</bold> Increased jitter in the timing of input events increases the variability in membrane voltage depolarization. <bold>(E)</bold> Variability can be controlled by increasing the number of inputs, but this is not cost-effective.</p></caption>
<graphic xlink:href="533815v2_fig3.tif" mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image"/>
</fig>
<p>To illustrate the severity of this problem, we modelled a single neuron using our abstract model, and fed it input spikes. We drew the times of these input spikes from a normal distribution, and varied the degree of input synchrony by changing the standard deviation of this normal distribution. We took the standard deviation to be a function of the membrane time constant <italic>τ</italic>, which defines the timescale of the neuron dynamics.</p>
<p>Spikes arriving even slightly out of sync with each other introduce noise in the membrane potential of the receiving neuron (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B,D</xref>), which can lead to the neuron failing to spike when it should have, or vice-versa. Asynchrony reduces the effective drive of the inputs (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>), which means that a failure to spike will occur more often than an errant spike. This loss of drive could be compensated by lowering the postsynaptic cell’s threshold, but variability due to jitter remains. This is shown in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>, where we used the coefficient of variation of the peak membrane potential (standard deviation divided by the mean) to summarize the membrane-voltage uncertainty. This grows with increasing input-timing jitter.</p>
<p>Having extended NMDA spikes remedies these issues (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). Because of the extension of the time-constant of the spikes, the uncertainty is filtered out, and the spikes are integrated as if they had arrived synchronously.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that these problems can also be addressed by increasing the number of inputs, thereby reducing the uncertainty through averaging. However, many inputs are required to keep the uncertainty in the membrane potential low; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref> shows that there is a linear relationship between the spike timing jitter in the inputs, and the number of input spikes necessary to have low uncertainty. Even for a relatively low amount of jitter in the input spike timings of 10 ms, the number of inputs required is in the hundreds. Furthermore, it is only possible to average-away timing jitter if timing variations are uncorrelated. This need not be the case, especially if timing jitter arises from variable conduction delays from common sources.</p>

<title>Active Dendrites confer Robustness in Spiking Computations</title>
<p>So far we have shown how a mechanism extracted from detailed biophysics naturally extends the integration window for excitatory inputs. While this might be useful in principle, it remains for us to show how such dynamics can permit non-trivial computations in a network.</p>
<p>In our model, the crucial difference between summation at the soma and summation at the dendrite is that each dendrite can sum subthreshold inputs passively and independently, while the soma is summing sustained plateau potentials from all dendrites that happen to be active. We have made fairly simple assumptions that the dendrite has linear properties beneath the threshold for a dendritic spike, and a relatively short time constant. If neither of these assumptions hold, then dendrites might have even more robust integration properties than our model assumes. In this sense our claims and results in this section are conservative.</p>
<p>We assumed that inputs to a network arrive at the dendrites within some time window, and their combined depolarisations are either sufficient to elicit a dendritic spike or not, as shown in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>. We consider <italic>fast computations</italic>, that is, a regime where the window in which spikes arrive is small, but not so small as to be equivalent to assuming perfect synchrony.</p>
<p>In this regime, each dendrite integrates over a time window and either reaches threshold or does not. Because we assume spike timing jitter in all inputs, each dendrite might reach threshold at different times for different presentations of the same nominal input. However, because dendritic spikes are sustained, jitter in the onset of these events across an entire cell has relatively little effect on whether the soma reaches threshold or not. This effect should confer spike timing robustness at the network level, which is the main claim we will test.</p>
<p>Before describing the implementation of the model and the results, we introduce a useful interpretation of the operating regime of the network. Network dynamics on short timescales can be interpreted as a binary computation, where incoming connections can be represented with a 1 (a presynaptic spike arrives) or a 0 (absence of a presynaptic spike), and the dendrite in turn produces a 1 (it fires) or a 0 (it does not). Connections between dendrites and soma are interpreted analogously: the dendrites produce 1s or 0s, and the soma sums these and compares the result to a firing threshold, thereby computing a 1 or 0. Interestingly, neurons and dendrites operating in this regime have been observed empirically, see e.g. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref>].</p>
<p>We used this binary interpretation in both a philosophical and practical sense in our spiking model. Philosophically, the binary analogy provides a clean intuition for how fast computations operate, with each unit (i.e. neuron) only having sufficient time to spike once during a single “pass” or “cycle” of a computation. Such situations do appear in biology; see e.g. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref>] for an example where neurons at each synaptic stage have about 10 ms to process presynaptic spikes and fire during an animal’s reaction time, leaving room for the receiving and firing of about one action potential per unit.</p>
<p>On a practical level the binary interpretation gives us a means for finding synaptic weights that allow us to train a network to perform a non-trivial computation, then test its robustness to timing jitter. We remind the reader that the focus of our investigation is not on the training or learning procedure, so the fact that we can train binary networks and use the weights in a dynamic, spiking network is not strictly relevant to the biology. However, it may give a powerful practical means for optimising hardware implementations of dynamic spiking networks. It may also hint that biological learning rules can operate in a somewhat equivalent manner.</p>
<p>We now outline the implementation. We built a Spiking Neural Network (SNN) where the individual neurons consist of our abstract neuron model. We constructed a separate Binary Neural Network (BNN) with the same number of equivalent units, and trained it using standard optimisation methods to perform a classification task (see: subsection 3.4 for details). The BNN is a static network where each unit’s state is either 0 or 1. BNNs can thus be regarded as the saturated limit of regular sigmoidal networks, i.e. with weights of large absolute value [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>]. As an aside we point out that BNNs are not restrictive computationally: any computable function can be approximated and implemented with a BNN [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref>].</p>
<p>The task we train the BNN for is shown in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>. The 2D input points (three classes, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>) were first projected onto a binary feature space, to obtain three binary vectors; each 13-D binary vector responding to a specific class The dimensionality of 13 was chosen because this was the lowest dimensionality in which the binary network could still cope with the loss of information due to the binarization of the continuous coordinates. If the <italic>i</italic><sup>th</sup> input of the binary vector was a 1, a randomly generated timepoint <italic>t</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> was added to produce an input spike (<italic>i, t</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>), meaning that input neuron <italic>i</italic> was fed an impulse so that it would spike at time <italic>t</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>. If the <italic>i</italic>th element of the binary vector was 0, it meant that neuron <italic>i</italic> would not fire for that input vector.</p>

</fig>
<p>The network architecture is set up so that each dendrite is connected to both a unique upstream neuron and a unique downstream soma (see <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref> for a sketch). The assumption that each neuron connects to one dendrite of a downstream neuron is actually grounded in physiology (but see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>]), although it may appear like a strong assumption at a first glance: related inputs arrive at local clusters of spines synchronously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref>]. We have modelled these dendritic patches that synchronously get excited by correlated inputs as one dendritic compartment. When a sufficiently large number of dendritic compartments have been excited, the soma will spike.</p>
<p>We have not explicitly accounted for inhibition in this model, although it plays an important role in determining when neurons fire. Our model tackles the question of how to deal with spike timing jitter in excitatory spikes. In order for it to be consistent, inhibition should at least not decrease spike timing synchrony. This is a reasonable assumption as inhibition plays an important role in improving synchronicity of spikes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref>]. Moreover, inhibition often follows excitatory inputs closely in time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>]. In our model, inhibition can be thought of as being implicitly accounted for, by regarding the inputs to the neurons as the net excitation in the presence of inhibition.</p>
<p>We transplanted the weight matrices of the trained BNN onto the spiking network, thereby obtaining a spiking network that could perform the classification. When the input neurons all spike simultaneously, the spiking network mimics the BNN exactly, i.e. the same units are active in both. But when asychrony is introduced, a discrepancy can arise. We introduce asynchrony in the network by moving the timing of the input spikes. Two examples of the spiking network receiving jittered input spikes are shown in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref> and E. In <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref> the dendrites are furnished with plateau potentials (as in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>, top). These three input vectors are classified correctly despite the input spike jitter. In fact, the identity of the neurons spiking are still the same units that emit a 1 in its BNN counterpart.</p>
<p>This stands in contrast with the network performance without dendritic plateaus (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>), as in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>, bottom. In <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref> it can be seen that the network now fails to process two of the three input vectors correctly. The duration of the dendritic spikes is too short so that they are too far apart in time, and the soma fails to reach threshold. To test how quickly this degrades performance, we tested the accuracy (as percentage of inputs classified correctly) of the network as the asynchrony increased. The network with active dendrites coped well, but the performance of the network without dendrites with plateau potentials degraded rapidly. This is quantified in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>, where we see that classification accuracy drops precipitously if spike timing jitter exceeds the membrane time constant significantly. In contrast, dendritic plateaus maintain performance even when spike jitter exceeds membrane time constant by an order of magnitude. It is worth pointing out that spikes can occur in any unit as soon as threshold is reached; dendritic potentials do not therefore prevent single computations occurring more rapidly.</p>
<p>Together, these results show in principle how a cellular mechanism that captures the essential abstract features of dendritic spikes can serve to enhance robustness of non-trivial spiking computations in a network. Furthermore, they provide an abstract interpretation of rapid spiking computations as binary neural network computations.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>An animal’s survival can hinge on its ability to make rapid, reliable decisions. Consequently, there will be evolutionary pressure for neural circuits to function at the most rapid timescale possible in some situations. For example, studies of primate visual reaction time estimate each neuron in the synaptic pathway has approximately 10 ms to make a firing decision, a time window allowing 1–2 spikes in each unit on average [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref>]. This places the excitatory units in these pathways in an effectively binary regime: either a neuron fires once during the entire computation or it does not.</p>
<p>We asked how cortical neurons might exploit dendritic nonlinearities to make such binary computations feasible in the biologically realistic situation of spike timing jitter and signalling noise. The significance of our work is to show that sparse yet reliable spiking computations may not require precisely synchronized inputs, yet yield and propagate reliable outputs.</p>
<p>Traditionally thought to be passive cables, we now know that dendrites possess a zoo of voltage-gated ion channels that generate nonlinear membrane potential dynamics [67, 61, 46, 63, 40, 50]. As with axonal conduction, dendritic excitability provides a means for signals to overcome spatial attenuation—so it is perhaps not surprising to find regenerative currents in dendrites, particularly the long, thin dendrites of cortical neurons.</p>
<p>It is far less obvious why dendritic action currents are so much slower than their axonal counterparts. Their temporal dynamics, along with their nonlinear amplitude dependence opens numerous ways for neurons to process time-varying signals. For instance, the dendrites of pyramidal neurons can perform complex tasks such as the discrimination of temporal signals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>] or the detection of coincident inputs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>]. In parallel with providing rich signal processing capabilities, dendritic transients influence activity-dependent synaptic plasticity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>], and may allow neural circuits to learn temporal patterns [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>].</p>
<p>We considered a complementary role for dendritic action currents that is not in conflict with any of these ideas, yet it addresses an outlying problem we believe is essential: making rapid cortical computation robust. Events in the external world are often asynchronous, yet may need to be processed by neural circuits that lump decisions into well-defined intervals. Inside the brain, conduction delays and intrinsic noise make asynchrony unavoidable in communication between neural circuits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>]. This poses a fundamental problem for the integration of related inputs: neurons with short membrane time constants can only integrate coincident inputs that arrive simultaneously within <italic>∼</italic> 1 ms of one another. Coordination of many such inputs in a distributed network therefore presents a fundamental challenge that was recognised in early attempts to understand computation in the brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">73</xref>]. We have shown that the long duration of nonlinear dendritic transients can remedy this situation by widening the integration time window of neurons.</p>
<p>Our hypothesis is consistent with several experimental findings. Blocking NMDA receptors impairs precise spike- timing synchrony and inter-area communication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">75</xref>], indicating an important role for NMDA-dependent dendritic transients in facilitating coordinated communication between neural circuits. Recently it was shown that NMDA spikes are a major determinant of neuronal output in vivo, and that these dendritic spikes can be triggered by a handful of synaptic inputs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>]. Our work provides further experimentally testable hypotheses: finer manipulation of dendritic transient time course, for example, by expression of chimaeric NMDA receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>] or calcium buffers, can shorten the integration window in cortical circuits. This should result in propagation failures, and failure to integrate distributed information. These effects should be visible directly in neural population activity and in behavioural performance in tasks involving rapid sensory discrimination, or fusion of information over multiple brain areas. Such an experiment would need to titrate the perturbation of dendritic dynamics to avoid less subtle circuit level effects that are seen in complete pharmacological blockade. This kind of manipulation would be exciting to apply in less extensively studied species, such as turtle, where cortical dynamics seem to operate close to a synfire chain regime [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>], propagating distributed patterns in which participating neurons fire sparsely.</p>
<p>We have been careful to respect the essence of basic physiological facts when constructing our abstract model, but a tractable model often involves approximations. One conspicuous omission is to account for temporal variation in inhibition, which plays an important role in determining when and if spikes can fire in a network. Leaving aside simplicity, we have two justifications for this in the present work: first, we wanted to isolate a mechanistic ‘kernel’ for dealing with spiking jitter in excitatory input by assuming that inhibition is present, and, at minimum, not making matters worse. In this setting one may interpret the excitatory inputs to the abstract model in the network (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>) as a <italic>net</italic> drive in the presence of both inhibition and excitation. We believe this is reasonable because inhibitory signals in many local circuits reflect local population activity and often reliably track excitatory input [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>]. Secondly, overwhelming evidence shows that inhibition itself plays an important role in enhancing synchrony in neural populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref>]. We want to return to the question of integrating these features of the physiology in future work, our hypothesis being that integrate-and-hold can serve to improve computational robustness, as we have shown, and furthermore permit information to be preserved throughout the phase of prominent network level oscillations in the brain that are largely orchestrated by inhibition.</p>
<p>Our model includes dynamics that are often simplified away in computational and theoretical studies. Much effort has been devoted to finding out the extent to which neuronal noise can deteriorate the function of neural networks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">76</xref>]. Sometimes out of practical necessity, these studies may assume a point model of a neuron [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>]. Our work shows that dendritic compartments and their dynamics may reduce the apparent fragility of spiking computations, prompting caution in how we interpret modelling results that lack these dynamics.</p>
<p>Other, simpler solutions to the asynchrony problem have been proposed. On possibility is that neural circuits exploit population averaging to overcome spike timing jitter [21, 65, 60, 43, 14]. However, this this is energetically costly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>] and would amount to scaling up the number of cells in a network to perform computations that could, in principle, be performed by fewer (but more robust) single units. We have argued that NMDA currents in distal dendrites can achieve robust, reliable threshold-based computation using relatively few resources. The longer duration of these potentials confers robustness to input timing without additional learning, reducing the number of neurons that must spike to achieve reliable signal transmission.</p>
<p>Synchrony could potentially be maintained in networks that are organized as feed-forward “synfire chains”, with relatively homogeneous transmission delays between nodes in each “rung” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>]. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>] emphasize a role for refractoriness in maintaining synchrony, noting that post-spike inhibition “clips” late inputs, thereby maintaining a localized packet in time. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>] explore further the importance of dendritic nonlinearities in stabilizing packet synchrony. The extent to which spike timing is reliable remains an open question, one that likely depends on the circuit and context. An alternative approach to reliable spiking computations is for units to respond to specific, predictable, patterns of asynchronous inputs. Several computational studies have shown this is possible [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>]. However, these solutions are by design sensitive, rather than invariant, to the timing and order of inputs. Such solutions are thus less suited to the setting we considered here. We suggest that the contrasting properties of timing-sensitive and timing-robust architectures are likely both present in nervous systems, depending on the specific function of the circuits in question.</p>
<p>Fast action potentials allow rapid, massively parallel communication in the brain. In principle this gives spiking networks the ability to perform complex computations efficiently. However, decades of research has identified obstacles to implementing spiking computations under biologically realistic conditions. Interestingly, advances in neuromorphic hardware have revitalized attention for the question of how biology solves the problem. Our work shows a means for rapid spiking computations to function robustly by providing a resettable temporal buffer in the input to each spiking unit. We would be excited to see experimental tests of whether dendrites do indeed fulfil this function in the nervous system, and whether this simple principle offers a bio-inspired means to scale up reliable spiking computations in hardware implementations of spiking neural networks.</p>

<title>Biophysical model</title>
<p>The biophysical model used to test the plausibility of the abstract model was taken from [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>], and was implemented in NEURON (version 7.5) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>]. The model can be found on ModelDB (no. 249705). The model represented a layer 5 pyramidal neuron [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>], and consisted of 85 compartments and 439 segments; 36 compartments for basal dendrites, 45 for apical dendrites, 3 for the soma, and one for the axon. A range of voltage-gated ion channels is included: sodium, A-type potassium, both high-voltage and low-voltage gated calcium, HCN, calcium-activated potassium, and K<sub>v</sub> type channels are present.</p>
<p>The glutamate release is simulated at basal dendrites with the indices 14, 15, and 34. These indices were chosen for no particular reason; any collection of numbers would have worked. The glutamate stimuli were all given a fraction of 0.9 away from the soma (where 1 is the total length of the dendrite), and were separated in time from each other with a 50ms delay.</p>
<p>For <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2G</xref>, a passive inhibitory current was added to basal dendrite 34 in which an NMDA spike was triggered.

<p>But for the purposes of backpropagation the derivative of <italic>ϕ</italic> is defined to be
<disp-formula id="ueqn3">
<graphic xlink:href="533815v2_ueqn3.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula>
which is the superspike derivative [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">74</xref>], equivalent to the derivative of a fast sigmoid. Using this derivative allows us to train the network, in spite of the step function having a derivative that is zero almost everywhere.</p>
<p>The network weights were initialized with the distribution:
<disp-formula id="ueqn4">
<graphic xlink:href="533815v2_ueqn4.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula>
where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="533815v2_inline6.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>.</p>
<p>The biases of the BNN units were set to <italic>−</italic>1, to enforce a positive firing threshold for the neurons.</p>
<p>Each dendrite receives input from one presynaptic neuron. Let <italic>N</italic><sub><italic>d</italic></sub> be the number of dendrites per neuron for a layer, and <italic>N</italic><sub><italic>o</italic></sub> the number of somas. First an <italic>N</italic><sub><italic>d</italic></sub> <italic>× N</italic><sub><italic>d</italic></sub> diagonal matrix is constructed for each soma in the next layer. Then the total weight matrix will be the vertical concatenation of all these diagonal matrices.</p>
<p>Similarly, each dendrite is coupled with only one soma. This is achieved by constructing an <italic>N</italic><sub><italic>o</italic></sub> <italic>× N</italic><sub><italic>d</italic></sub> matrix for output unit <italic>i</italic> where only the <italic>i</italic>th row is non-zero. The overall weight matrix is the horizontal concatenation of these matrices.</p>
<p>The weight matrices used by the network alternate between the matrices with ‘dendrites constraints’ (a matrix that projects onto a layer of dendrites), and matrices with ‘soma constraints’ (a matrix projecting onto a layer of somas).</p>
<p>For both weight matrices elements that are initially zero, remain zero during the training procedure, and the elements of the weight matrices were constrained to be nonnegative, by having the activation of a unit in the BNN be
<disp-formula id="ueqn5">
<graphic xlink:href="533815v2_ueqn5.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula>
</p>
<p>We implemented this constraint because we modelled pyramidal neurons, which are excitatory neurons. Therefore, the weights from the connections of these neurons should be positive.</p>
<p>The BNN was trained using stochastic gradient descent and surrogate gradient methods. First the network outputs <italic>ŷ</italic>(<italic>x</italic>) where put through the softmax function
<disp-formula id="eqn5">
<graphic xlink:href="533815v2_eqn5.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula>
which was then parsed through the cross-entropy function
<disp-formula id="eqn6">
<graphic xlink:href="533815v2_eqn6.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula>
where ŷ<sub><italic>i</italic></sub> is the output in response to input x<sub><italic>i</italic></sub> belonging to the batch of size <italic>B</italic> and <italic>y</italic><sub><italic>i,j</italic></sub> the <italic>j</italic>th element of the corresponding target.</p>
<p>The stochastic gradient descent was performed by randomly shuffling the inputs and labels and choosing a batch size (30 in our case). Then in each epoch all batches were iterated over, and the parameters were updated using the Adam algorithm. Training was terminated when the network gave the correct answer for more than 90% of all input points.</p>

<title>Spiking network</title>
<p>After having a set of weights that gave good performance with the BNN those weights were transplanted to a spiking network with the abstract models from subsection 3.2. This was done through setting the input currents to
<disp-formula id="ueqn6">
<graphic xlink:href="533815v2_ueqn6.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula>
where <italic>s</italic><sub><italic>j</italic></sub>(<italic>t</italic>) is the postsynaptic conductance of neuron <italic>j</italic>, which projects on dendrites <italic>i</italic> with weight <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="533815v2_inline7.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>. Here, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="533815v2_inline8.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> is the nonzero element of the <italic>i</italic>th row of the weight matrix of this layer, trained with the ‘dendrite constraints’ (see subsection 3.4). This element is unique due to the constraints imposed on the weight matrices during training.</p>
<p>This dendrite is coupled to its soma with weight <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="533815v2_inline9.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> to give the current
<disp-formula id="ueqn7">
<graphic xlink:href="533815v2_ueqn7.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula>
with <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="533815v2_inline10.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> the (again unique) nonzero element of the <italic>i</italic>th row of the next weight matrix, trained with the ‘soma constraints’, and so on.</p>
<p>The 13 dimensional spikes were fed into the network by means of an input layer. This layer consisted of 13 neurons, one for each element in the binary input vectors. If the corresponding element was a 1, this neuron would be made to fire by giving them the same boxcar-shaped input current as described in subsection 3.2.</p>
<p>The degree of synchrony in the input spikes could then be controlled by varying the timing at which these impulses were given to the input neurons. Every input spike packet was centered around an input time <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="533815v2_inline11.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>. Then the degree of asynchrony <italic>τ</italic> was varied by letting each spiketime, for each input neuron <italic>i</italic>, be
<disp-formula id="ueqn8">
<graphic xlink:href="533815v2_ueqn8.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula>
</p>
<p>To compare the performance of a spiking network without the dendritic plateaus to networks with plateaus, the ‘hold’ on the dynamics of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="533815v2_inline12.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> was removed. Therefore, the dendrite potential would decay immediately back to rest after reaching threshold. Otherwise, the architecture remained unchanged. For <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D,E</xref> the input volleys were centered at 15ms, 35ms, and 55ms, with an asynchrony measure of <italic>τ</italic> = 10ms.</p>
<p>An answer given by the spiking network was considered correct if neuron <italic>i</italic> in the output layer produced one spike when the input point belonged to class <italic>i</italic>, and the other neurons remained silent.</p>
<p>To compare the accuracies with and without plateaus in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>, the spike times of the input neurons were produced independently for each data point and each value of <italic>τ</italic>, with the spike packet being centered at 10 ms. Then the same spike times were used for both network versions, and the accuracy of the network was measured as the percentage of points classified correctly by the network. In each simulation, each network saw one input vector only, to prevent interference from multiple overlapping inputs for high jitter values.</p>

<p>This <bold>important</bold> study develops and exploits novel ideas in dendritic integration and implements these ideas in a neural network. Historically, dendritic plateau potentials were thought to exist primarily for maintaining neurons in a depolarized state for 100s of milliseconds, but this study presents a new perspective that dendritic plateau potentials are equally effective in much shorter integration windows. The computational evidence supporting the article's claims is <bold>compelling</bold>.</p>

<p>Summary.</p>
<p>Some forms of Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly those based on artificial neural networks (ANNs), draw inspiration from biological brains and neurons. Understanding the functional repertoire and underlying logic of real neurons could, therefore, help improve ANNs. While the cell bodies and axons of neurons produce rapid, high-amplitude action potentials (~100 mV over ~2 ms), dendrites-constituting about 80% of neuronal membrane area-generate smaller but longer-lasting electrical signals, known as glutamate-mediated dendritic plateau potentials (~50 mV over &gt;100 ms). The authors have designed artificial neurons capable of producing these dendritic plateau potentials and, through simulations, demonstrate that such prolonged dendritic signals reduce the negative effects of temporal jitter in real or artificial neural networks. Specifically, they show that in ANNs with neurons capable of dendritic plateau potentials, reliable sparse spiking computation can occur without the need for precise input synchronization. This means that despite fluctuations in network activity (such as delays in the brain circuit responses, for example), neurons can still link related network events. Thus, dendritic plateau potentials enable neurons to retain information longer, connecting events that are not exactly simultaneous. Interestingly, one of the indirect conclusions of the current study is that neurons equipped with dendritic plateau potentials may reduce the total number of cells (nodes, units) required to perform robust computations.</p>
<p>Strengths.</p>
<p>Most studies in neuroscience are descriptive, focusing on observations and measurements. Fewer tackle the more challenging task of explaining the rationale behind specific natural designs. This study does just that, addressing the fundamental problem of asynchrony in neural communication caused by conduction delays and noise. Given that neurons with short membrane time constants can integrate only nearly simultaneous inputs, the authors propose a solution: dendritic plateau potentials. These potentials, generated through glutamate-mediated depolarization within dendritic branches, effectively broaden the temporal integration window, allowing neurons to handle temporal jitter, variability, stochasticity, and maintain reliable computation. Thus, dendritic plateau potentials appear to be an adaptive feature evolved to support rapid, reliable CNS computations.</p>
<p>Weaknesses.</p>
<p>The authors have appropriately revised unsupported statements from previous versions, but the manuscript could benefit from examples of testable hypotheses derived from their findings. For example, what specific experimental questions could be investigated to validate these computational predictions? Providing concrete examples of potential experimental tests would make the work more accessible and actionable for experimentalists, assuming such experiments are feasible.</p>
<p>Additionally, many readers may lack a background in computational modeling or Artificial Neural Networks. To enhance accessibility, key terms and concepts should be explained at a level suitable for first-year graduate students, ensuring clarity for a broader audience.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>This is an elegant didactic exposition showing how dendritic plateau potentials can enable neurons to perform reliable 'binary' computations in the face of realistic spike time jitter in cortical networks. The authors make many good arguments, and the general concept underlying the paper is sound. A strength is their systematic progression from biophiysical to simplified models of single neurons, and their parallel investigation of spiking and binary neural networks, with training happening in the binary neural network.</p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Artificial intelligence (AI) could be useful in some applications and could help humankind. Some forms of AI work on the platform of artificial neural networks (ANN). ANNs are inspired by real brains and real neurons. Therefore understanding the repertoire and logic of real neurons could potentially improve AANs. Cell bodies of real neurons, and axons of real neurons, fire nerve impulses (nerve impulses are very brief ~2 ms, and very tall ~100 mV). Dendrites, which comprise ~80% of the total neuronal membrane (80% of the total neuronal apparatus) typically generate smaller (~50 mV amplitude) but much longer (~100 ms duration) electrical transients, called glutamate-mediated dendritic plateau potentials. The authors have built artificial neurons capable of generating such dendritic plateau potentials, and through computer simulations the authors concluded that long-lasting dendritic signals</p>
<p>(plateau potentials) reduce negative impact of temporal jitter occurring in real brain, or in</p>
<p>AANs. The authors showed that in AANs equipped with neurons whose dendrites are capable of generating local dendritic plateau potentials, the sparse, yet reliable spiking computations may not require precisely synchronized inputs. That means, the real world can impose notable fluctuations in the network activity and yet neurons could still recognize and pair the related network events. In the AANs equipped with dendritic plateaus, the computations are very robust even when inputs are only partially synchronized. In summary, dendritic plateau potentials endow neurons with ability to hold information longer and connect two events which did not happen at the same moment of time. Dendritic plateaus circumvent the negative impact, which the short membrane time constants arduously inflict on the action potential generation (in both real neurons and model neurons). Interestingly, one of the indirect conclusions of the current study is that neurons equipped with dendritic plateau potentials may reduce the total number of cells (nodes, units) required to perform robust computations.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The majority of published studies are descriptive in nature. Researchers report what they see or measure. A smaller number of studies embark on a more difficult task, which is to explain the logic and rationale of a particular natural design. The current study falls into that second category. The authors first recognize that conduction delays and noise make asynchrony unavoidable in communication between circuits in the real brain. This poses a fundamental problem for the integration of related inputs in real (noisy) world. Neurons with short membrane time constants can only integrate coincident inputs that arrive simultaneously within 2-3 ms of one another. Then the authors considered the role for dendritic plateau potentials. Glutamate-mediated depolarization events within individual dendritic branches, can remedy the situation by widening the integration time window of neurons. In summary, the authors recognized that one important feature of neurons, their dendrites, are built-in to solve the major problems of rapid signal processing: [1] temporal jitter, [2] variation, [3] stochasticity, and [4] reliability of computation. In one word, the dendritic plateau potentials have evolved in the central nervous systems to make rapid CNS computations robust.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The authors made some unsupported statements, which should either be deleted, or thoroughly defended in the manuscript. But first of all, the authors failed to bring this study to the readers who are not experts in computational modeling or Artificial Neural Networks. Critical terms (syntax) and ideas have not been explained. For example: [1] binary feature space? [2] 13 dimensions binary vectors? [3] the binary network could still cope with the loss of information due to the binarization of the continuous coordinates? [4] accurate summation?</p>
<p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>However, I have a number of specific points, listed below, that should be addressed. Most of them are relatively minor, but the authors should especially address point 10, which is a major point, by redoing the simulations affected by the erroneous value of the time constant, and by remaking the relevant figures based on the new simulations.</p>
<p>Specific comments:</p>
<p>(1) 7f &quot;This feature is conspicuous because it is an order of magnitude longer than unitary synaptic inputs and axonal spikes.&quot;: — It is an order of magnitude longer than AMPA receptor-mediated synaptic currents (EPSCs), but more similar in time course to synaptic potentials (EPSPs) whose decay is governed by the passive membrane time constant (about 10 to 20 ms in pyramidal neurons in vivo) and which determines the lifetime of the 'memory' of the neuron for synaptic inputs under conditions of subthreshold, non-spiking dendritic integration. The quoted sentence should be rewritten accordingly.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Following this suggestion, we have rewritten the sentence (l. 7) to: &quot;This timescale is conspicuous, being many times longer than the fastest signalling processes in the nervous systems, including Excitatory Post-Synaptic Potentials (EPSPs) and axonal spikes.&quot;</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) 16ff &quot;This is especially relevant to integration of inputs during high conductance states that are prevalent in-vivo. In these states the effective time constant of the neuronal membrane is extremely short and varies substantially depending on synaptic drive [13, 34, 49].&quot;: — The time-averaged synaptic conductance driven by sensory input in vivo is much less high than implied by this statement (e.g. see Fig. 4 of Haider et al. 2013 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature11665">https://www.nature.com/articles/nature11665</ext-link> ), and reduces the passive membrane time constant only by a small percentage. The energy cost of a high prevalence of highconductance states and extremely short membrane time constants would also exceed the energy budget of the brain (ref. 4). I would therefore suggest dropping this sentence.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have clarified this sentence thanks to the reviewer's suggestion. We meant that the instantaneous, rather than the time-averaged, conductance can be very big. To clarify this we have rewritten this section (l. 15): This is especially relevant to integration of inputs during high conductance states that are prevalent in vivo, where a typical neuron receives significant synaptic drive. In these states, the effective membrane time constant can be extremely short, and varies substantially depending on synaptic input.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) l. 17f &quot;As a consequence, computations that rely on passive summation of multiple inputs place punishing constraints on spike timing precision.&quot;: — Again, the passive membrane time constant is on the order of 10 ms and I would tone down this statement accordingly, removing the word 'punishing' for example.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Following the suggestion, we have rewritten the sentence to (l. 18): &quot;As a consequence, computations that rely on passive summation of multiple inputs would place strong constraints on spike timing precision.&quot;</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) l. 18ff &quot;Dendritic action potentials, by contrast, have a consistently long duration that is ensured by the kinetic properties of voltage gated ion channels and NMDA receptors [54, 47, 10, 3]. These properties are largely determined by the amino acid sequence of receptor and channel proteins that are specifically expressed in dendrites [45, 44, 40]. This suggests dendritic properties are specifically tuned to produce localised, suprathreshold events that outlive rapid membrane fluctuations.&quot;: — Yes, but see also Attwell &amp; Gibb 2005 ( <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nrn1784">https://www.nature.com/articles/nrn1784</ext-link> ), especially the last two of their key points. The slow NMDA receptor decay kinetics (and therefore their high affinity for binding glutamate) may also be the consequence of a design goal to set the temporal coherence window for NMDA receptor-mediated synaptic plasticity such as STDP to be on the order of tens of milliseconds, somewhat longer than the membrane time constant.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The reviewer is correct; other functions (e.g. synaptic plasticity) are also part of the dendrite's repertoire. To acknowledge this, we added a section (l. 34) where we mention that our idea does not conflict with, for example, synaptic plasticity.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) l. 32f &quot;Numerous studies point out that nonlinear summation in dendrites can make neurons computationally equivalent to entire networks of simplified point models, or 'units' in a traditional neural network [9, 21, 38, 40, 45, 48, 50, 51].&quot;: — See also Beniaguev et al. 2021 ( <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.cell.com/neuron/pdf/S0896-6273(21)00501-8.pdf">https://www.cell.com/neuron/pdf/S0896-6273(21)00501-8.pdf</ext-link> ), which also speaks to the next sentence.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for the suggestion; the citation has been added.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(6) Fig. 2E and F: the top of panel F corresponds to the top of panel E, but the bottom ofpanel F does not correspond to the bottom of panel E - it corresponds to a dendritic neuron with passive dendrites, not a point neuron. Panel E should be changed to reflect this fact.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have followed the suggestion to change the figure.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(7) l. 49f &quot;Despite these dendritic spikes being initiated at different times, they still sum in the soma, leading to a sodium spike there (Figure 2E).&quot;: — You probably mean Fig. 2D, and instead of a sodium spike (which could be misunderstood as local and dendritic) you triggered a sodium action potential. Likewise, Fig. 2B (right) shows the timescale of sodium action potentials at the soma (cf. l. 46).</p>
</disp-quote>

<p>(9) l. 68 &quot;This time constant is consistent with the high-conductance state of pyramidalneurons in the cortex [6]&quot;:</p>
<p>You do not need to invoke a high-conductance state to justify this time constant, which is indeed typical for the membrane time constant of pyramidal neurons in vivo.</p>
<p>On a related note, Fig. 3B and its legend seem to assume that tau = 1 ms, and calls that one EPSP duration in the legend. An EPSC may have a decay time constant of 1 ms, but an EPSP will have a decay time constant of about 10 ms, similar to the membrane time constant. Fig. 3B (and therefore also the rest of Figure 3) seems to have been constructed with a value of tau that is too small by a factor of 10, and this should be corrected by remaking the figure. If tau = 1 ms was used also in Figure 4 then this figure also needs to be remade.</p>
<p>Section 3.3 and Table 1 also use tau = 1 ms. This is unrealistic and needs to be changed an appropriate value of tau = 10 ms is given by the authors themselves in line 67. The incorrect value of tau in Table 1 causes other entries of the Table to be terribly wrong; a leak conductance of 1 µS would imply an input resistance of the neuron of 1 MOhm, but somatic input resistances of pyramidal neurons in vivo are on the order of 20 to 50 MOhm. The total capacitance of 1 nF is slightly too large, and should be adjusted to yield a membrane time constant of 10 ms given an appropriate leak conductance leading to an input resistance of about 20 to 50 MOhm. These are key numbers to get right for both Figures 3 and 4, especially if you want to be able to say &quot;We have been careful to respect the essence of basic physiological facts while trying to build an abstraction of how elementary spiking computations might occur.&quot; (l. 215f).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for catching this. We had actually already used tau = 10 ms, but had not yet updated the paper. Moreover, the somatic input resistance was indeed off. To rectify this, we have used the values: $Cm = 0.5 nF$, $\taum = 10 ms$, $Rm = 20 M \Ohm$, $gl = 0.05 \mu S$. Figure 3 was remade using these values, and Table 1 updated accordingly.</p>

<p>(11) I note that the plateaus in Fig. 4D are much shorter than those in Fig. 2D and F, but thisis a good thing: The experimental and simulation results in Fig. 2 are based on ref. 18, which used microiontophoresis of glutamate, leading to much slower glutamate concentration time courses at the dendritic NMDA receptors than synaptic release of glutamate would. The time courses of plateaus in Fig. 4 are much more in line with the NMDA plateau durations shown in ref. 21, especially their Figure 2B. These faster NMDA plateaus (or NMDA spikes as they are called in ref. 21) are based on synaptic release of glutamate in vivo, and on the faster NMDA receptor kinetics at physiological temperature compared to the old models with room temperature kinetics used in ref. 18.</p>

<p>(13) In the abstract, the authors repeat sentences: &quot;the timescale of dendritic potentialsallows reliable integration of asynchronous inputs&quot; and &quot;nonlinear dendritic plateau potentials allow reliable integration of asynchronous spikes&quot;. Besides this being a bad writing style, the authors cannot decide if inputs to the model neuron are asynchronous, or spiking of the model neuron is asynchronous. Are these asynchronous spikes occurring in the neuron experiencing dendritic plateau potentials, or these asynchronous spikes occur in the neuronal network? This confusion of terms and ideas must be removed from the abstract.</p>

<p>(14) In the abstract, the authors claim: &quot;Our results provide empirically testable hypothesesfor the role of dendritic action potentials in cortical function&quot;.

In the text of the manuscript, the authors must carefully reveal the precise experimental outline that would test their specific hypothesis, or delete the untrue statement.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We respectfully challenge the rather critical tone of the reviewer. The central hypothesis that plateaus enable robust summation, and that circuit level computations rely on this is an experimentally testable hypothesis. The precise experimental design of how to test such a hypothesis is always best left to an experimentalist to determine, as there are many possible means of doing this and each will depend on the preparation and methodology at hand. At the same time, we understand that there is an increasing culture of expecting explicit &quot;testable hypotheses&quot; spelled out to the reader. To satisfy this expectation while avoiding overly prescriptive ideas for how future work should proceed, we have now added more explicit descriptions of possible experimental tests in l. 231 and onwards.</p>

<p>(15) Fig. 2F was submitted for review without a time scale, while at the same time the authorsheavily discuss specific numerical values for time intervals.

<p>&quot;We compared this to a situation where all inputs arrive at a soma with standard LIF dynamics and a 10 ms membrane time constant. This time constant is consistent with the high-conductance state of pyramidal neurons in the cortex [6]: Inputs decay after 2-3 ms, and fail to sum to spike threshold (Figure 2F, lower)&quot;.</p>
