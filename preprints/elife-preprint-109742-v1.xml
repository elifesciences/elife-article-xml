<abstract>
<p>Male <italic>Drosophila</italic> courtship behavior is a key model for studying temporal decision-making. While courtship index (CI) is widely used to quantify mating activity, other timing metrics like courtship latency, copulation latency (CL), and mating duration (MD) remain understudied. Traditional methods for quantifying these behaviors are often labor-intensive and prone to human error.</p>
<p>In this study, we present a protocol combining a modular chamber system and automated software (DrosoMating) to quantify 6 key timing metrics during male courtship. High-resolution video tracking enable precise analysis of courtship initiation, persistence, and mating dynamics under controlled conditions. Validation shows &lt;0.05% error rates and 98–99% agreement with manual scoring for CL, CI, and MD. The protocol supports genetic and neural circuit manipulations, detecting subtle genetic, social, and environmental behavioral variations.</p>
<p>By minimizing manual effort and standardizing data collection, this approach facilitates scalable, reproducible studies on adaptive trade-offs, learning, and neural mechanisms in mating behavior. This method streamlines timing analysis in male courtship, offering reproducible metrics for behavioral genetics.”</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Time perception is critical for survival, enabling organisms to estimate intervals between events and execute adaptive behaviors. Male <italic>Drosophila</italic> courtship behavior, a genetically well-characterized model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Singh and Singh, 2016</xref>), provides a robust framework for studying temporal control in action sequences. A widely used metric to quantify mating activity is the ‘Courtship Index (CI)’, defined as the percentage of time a male engages in courtship behaviors (e.g., following, wing vibration, abdominal curling) toward a female during a standardized observation window. CI reflects both the intensity and persistence of courtship, serving as a sensitive readout for dissecting genetic, environmental, or experimental perturbations on mating behavior, as demonstrated in studies investigating genetic mutations, environmental perturbations, and neuronal manipulations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Benton, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Greenspan and Ferveur, 2000a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Kim, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Pavlou and Goodwin, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Yamamoto and Koganezawa, 2013</xref>).</p>
<p>Despite extensive research on courtship displays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Chen et al., 2024a</xref>), other critical metrics remain poorly characterized, especially as their representative characteristics as timing behaviors. ‘Courtship latency’ (time until a male initiates courtship after detecting a female) may reflect motivational state or sensory processing deficits but is rarely quantified in terms of genetics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Eastwood and Burnet, 1977a</xref>). ‘Copulation Latency (CL)’ (time from courtship initiation to successful mating) and ‘Copulation (Mating) Duration (MD)’ (length of mating itself) are similarly underexplored, though both likely impact reproductive success. Prolonged MD enhances paternity assurance by maximizing sperm transfer and suppressing female remating, but it simultaneously increases predation risks and energy expenditure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bretman et al., 2009</xref>). Conversely, reduced MD may decrease a male’s paternity share due to incomplete sperm transfer or female resistance, yet it reduces exposure to ecological threats (e.g., predators, rivals) and conserves metabolic resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Lee et al., 2023a</xref>). These traits may be influenced by cryptic factors such as male age, rival presence, or environmental stressors (e.g., temperature), yet their genetic and neural bases are unclear. While studies focus on stereotyped courtship actions, these “temporal metrics” offer insights into decision-making, persistence, and adaptive trade-offs—areas ripe for investigation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Huang et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Kim et al., 2012a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">2013a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">2016</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Lee et al., 2022</xref>; D. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Sun et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Y. Sun et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Wong et al., 2019</xref>; T. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Zhang et al., 2024b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">2024a</xref>; X. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Zhang et al., 2024</xref>).</p>
<p>Numerous software tools have been developed to measure male mating behavior in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, yet many laboratories still rely on manual methods. Traditional approaches, such as the “courtship wheel”, have been widely used to assess male courtship activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Hall, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Neckameyer and Bhatt, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Vosshall, 2007</xref>). However, quantifying the full repertoire of mating behaviors metrics has historically been labor-intensive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Ejima and Griffith, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Sokolowski, 2001</xref>). Recent advances in automation have addressed these challenges. For instance, Dankert et al., introduced a machine vision system to quantify male-female interactions, though its application has been more focused on studying male-male aggression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Dankert et al., 2009a</xref>). With the rapid development of machine learning and image processing, tools such as ‘Ctrax’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Branson et al., 2009</xref>), ‘idTracker’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Pérez-Escudero et al., 2014</xref>), Cadabra (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Stern et al., 2015</xref>), ‘FlyTracker’ and MATLAB combined with ‘JAABA’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Barwell et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Kabra et al., 2013</xref>) have enabled precise quantification of male-female mating behavior. Recently, Chen et al., introduced an image-processing-based system that addresses this gap by automatically recognizing multiple courtship elements with high accuracy (&gt;97%) and robust identity tracking even during complete fly overlap(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Chen et al., 2024b</xref>). Despite these advancements, recent efforts to simplify courtship conditioning protocols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Gil-Martí et al., 2023a</xref>) still lack of certain timing-related behavioral repertoires after copulation. Consequently, there is a need for more streamlined protocols and software to accurately measure the timing aspects of male mating behavior in <italic>Drosophila</italic>.</p>
<p>Beyond <italic>Drosophila</italic>-specific tools, general behavioral video analysis paradigms have been developed to track the movement and behavior of various organisms, including fruit flies. These methods often focus on tracking the position of single or multiple flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Iyengar et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Qu et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Simon et al., 2011</xref>) or using artificial markers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Gal et al., 2020</xref>). Additionally, programs like ‘ToxTrac’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Rodriguez et al., 2017</xref>), ‘UMATracker’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Yamanaka and Takeuchi, 2018</xref>), ‘FIMTrack’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Risse et al., 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">2014</xref>), and ‘ilastik’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Berg et al., 2019</xref>) have been employed to analyze body posture, behavior, location, and movement trajectories in diverse species, including flies, bees, mice, and zebrafish. However, these tools often fall short in capturing the nuanced courtship behaviors of <italic>Drosophila</italic>, as motion data alone may not sufficiently represent complex interactions.</p>
<p>To address these limitations, we have developed a specialized software called ‘DrosoMating’ suite for analyzing and quantifying timing behaviors within male <italic>Drosophila</italic> courtship. By establishing 6 key indicators related to male courtship, we provide a robust framework for quantifying male mating behavior metrics under controlled conditions. This approach significantly reduces the time and errors associated with manual identification. Through iterative optimization, our system achieves an error rate of less than 0.05% compared to manual scoring. We believe this toolset offers a novel and efficient method for studying timing in male courtship behavior, providing valuable data and theoretical insights while streamlining the analysis process.</p>

<title>Video-Processing Solutions for Precise <italic>Drosophila</italic> Identification in Multi-Chamber Setups</title>
<p>Accurate identification of <italic>Drosophila</italic> individuals is essential for behavioral quantification given their small size. DrosoMating addresses this through three integrated video-processing features that enhance recognition fidelity in multi-chamber environments.</p>
<p>First, an effective recognition region function isolates individual wells as discrete analysis zones (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref> bottom), eliminating interference from adjacent chambers and background artifacts. Second, an image learning function adapts to phenotypic variability across strains. Operators designate three sample flies (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>), enabling the algorithm to internalize strain-specific morphological signatures for improved detection. Third, a manual threshold adjustment function permits post-recognition optimization. Users visually validate automated identifications and dynamically refine sensitivity parameters (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>), correcting false positives/negatives. Collectively, these features ensure robust tracking accuracy across diverse experimental setups and genetic backgrounds.</p>

<title>Development and Validation of DrosoMating for Automated <italic>Drosophila</italic> Mating Behavior Analysis</title>
<p>To address the labor-intensive nature, high error rates, and limitations in quantifying complex behavioral metrics during manual observation of <italic>Drosophila</italic> mating, we developed the software DrosoMating. This tool automates analysis of mating videos recorded in a customized chamber. DrosoMating processes videos to generate a CSV file containing 6 key behavioral metrics: courtship duration, MD, CI, courtship start time, mating start time, and mating end time. While these metrics are individually straightforward, they can be combined to quantify diverse aspects of mating behavior metrics.</p>
<p>DrosoMating enables quantification of specific mating behaviors based on research needs. We focused on three core indices:
<list list-type="order">
<list-item><p><bold>Courtship Index (CI):</bold> Indicates male courtship investment per unit time. Higher CI values (reflecting longer durations of behaviors like wing vibration or female chasing) suggest stronger male courtship motivation or higher female attractiveness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Greenspan and Ferveur, 2000b</xref>).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><bold>Copulation Latency (CL):</bold> Measures the time from courtship initiation to copulation start. Shorter CL indicates efficient male courtship or high female receptivity. Longer CL may reflect male courtship deficits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Eastwood and Burnet, 1977b</xref>), intense female rejection, or environmental stressors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Greenspan and Ferveur, 2000b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Singh and Singh, 2014</xref>).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><bold>Mating Duration (MD):</bold> Represents the copulation period length. Longer MD may enhance sperm competition but increases predation risk and energy costs, illustrating an evolutionary trade-off between reproduction and survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Greenspan and Ferveur, 2000b</xref>).</p></list-item>
</list>
Together, CI, CL, and MD provide a robust framework for characterizing <italic>Drosophila</italic> behavioral states during mating. Accurate quantification of these metrics is essential.</p>
<p>Because overlapping behaviors occur frequently during courtship and mating. When flies overlap for ≤15 frames, centroid velocity continuity is used to assign identity; if overlap &gt;15 frames, the region is flagged ‘occluded’ and excluded from CI calculation.</p>
<p>We validated DrosoMating by comparing its output for CI, CL, and MD against values from repeated, corrected manual measurements. Differences between software-generated data and manual data were consistently within 10 seconds for all three metrics, with no statistically significant differences (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A-C</xref>). Manual quantification of these metrics requires several hours of effort and is prone to substantial human error. In contrast, DrosoMating automates the analysis. After a few minutes of initial setup and configuration, the software generates precise behavioral metrics from mating videos.</p>

<title>Validation of DrosoMating Across Diverse <italic>Drosophila</italic> Strains and Behavioral Paradigms</title>
<p>DrosoMating was adapted to quantify mating behaviors metrics across diverse <italic>Drosophila</italic> strains and experimental conditions. To evaluate its universality and accuracy, mating interactions were analyzed between virgin females and males of four strains: <italic>Canton-S</italic> (wild-type), <italic>Oregon-R</italic> (wild-type), <italic>w<sup>1118</sup></italic>(white eye mutant), and <italic>y<sup>1</sup></italic> (yellow body color mutant). These lines have been extensively employed as standard inbred strains in research contexts for a prolonged period. Wild-type strains (<italic>Canton-S</italic> and <italic>Oregon-R</italic>) exhibited significantly higher CI, CL, and MD compared to <italic>w<sup>1118</sup></italic> and <italic>y<sup>1</sup></italic> mutants (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A–C</xref>). This quantitative assessment revealed markedly reduced activity in mutant males across all three behavioral metrics, consistent with known phenotypic limitations: <italic>w<sup>1118</sup></italic> males displayed restricted courtship due to visual impairment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Krstic et al., 2013</xref>), while <italic>y<sup>1</sup></italic> males demonstrated suboptimal mating performance, aligning with prior reports of courtship deficits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Drapeau et al., 2006</xref>).</p>

<title>Mating Behavior Measurement Preparations</title>
<p>This protocol outlines the collection of male and virgin female <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> and details the standardized mating behavior assay. To ensure experimental reproducibility, each cohort (genotype or condition) must include ≥100 individuals per sex, with final mating counts reaching at least 20 successful pairs (ideally 70-80) within a 2-hour observation window. The protocol spans developmental stages from egg to adult emergence, with adults requiring 5 days post-eclosion to attain sexual maturity. Flies are reared under controlled environmental conditions (25°C, 60-70% relative humidity, 12-hour light/dark cycle) to minimize physiological variability. To avoid confounding effects of anesthesia on mating behavior, CO<sub>2</sub> exposure was strictly minimized during fly handling and sorting; brief, low-intensity exposure was reserved for initial virgin collection and before starting behavioral assays.</p>

<title>Advancing Courtship Behavior Analysis in <italic>Drosophila</italic>: From Manual Tracking to computer-vision classifier</title>
<p>The study of male <italic>Drosophila</italic> mating behavior represents a cornerstone in neurogenetics, providing critical insights into the neural and molecular mechanisms underlying innate social behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Dauwalder, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Dukas, 2020</xref>). Historically, the CI—quantifying the proportion of time spent in courtship activities—has served as a fundamental metric for evaluating mating activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Greenspan and Ferveur, 2000a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Griffith and Ejima, 2009b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Pavlou and Goodwin, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Sokolowski, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Yamamoto and Koganezawa, 2013</xref>). However, traditional methodologies relied on labor-intensive manual observation, limiting their capacity to capture dynamic behavioral repertoires such as orientation, wing extension (“courtship song”), and copulation sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Dauwalder, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Dukas, 2020</xref>). While machine vision systems like Dankert et al.’s automated platform advanced quantification of social interactions, their primary application skewed toward male-male aggression rather than nuanced courtship dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Dankert et al., 2009b</xref>). Concurrently, research into genetic and environmental modulators—including <italic>fruitless</italic> (<italic>fru</italic>) and <italic>doublesex</italic> (<italic>dsx</italic>) gene pathways, cuticular hydrocarbons, and sensory cues—highlighted the need for scalable, high-resolution tools to dissect multimodal influences on behavior.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s5b">
<title>Technical Innovation and Validation</title>
<p>DrosoMating addresses these gaps through an integrated framework combining modular environmental chambers, automated video tracking, and machine-based annotation. This system minimizes manual intervention while capturing temporally precise metrics such as CL, CI, and MD. Validation against ground-truth manual scoring demonstrated exceptional accuracy (98–99% agreement; error rates &lt;0.05%), underscoring reliability for high-throughput screens. Crucially, the platform detected subtle behavioral variations across genotypes—e.g., e.g., diminished courtship vigor in w1118 and y1 mutants—and environmental manipulations such as group-rearing or prior sexual experience, which respectively shortened mating duration by ∼8–12 %. This sensitivity enables investigations into adaptive trade-offs, learning phenotypes, and circuit-level mechanisms. For instance, DrosoMating replicated classic deficits in aversive learning following mushroom body ablation and courtship impairments in <italic>rutabaga</italic> learning mutants, corroborating its utility for behavioral neuroscience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Levin et al., 1992</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s5c">
<title>Limitations and Future Directions</title>
<p>Despite its advantages, DrosoMating currently lacks granularity for posture-specific interactions (e.g., “wing threat” during aggression or “circling” during courtship) and multisensory integration. Future iterations could incorporate 3D pose estimation algorithms (e.g., DeepLabCut) or integrate JAABA-based classifiers to expand action repertoires (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Kabra et al., 2013</xref>). Environmental control—though essential for standardization—may limit ecological validity;</p>

<p>This <bold>useful</bold> paper describes a software tool, &quot;DrosoMating&quot;, which allows automated, high-throughput quantification of 6 common metrics of courtship and mating behaviors in Drosophila melanogaster. The validity of the tool is quite <bold>convincingly</bold> demonstrated by comparing expert human assessments with those made by DrosoMating. The work, however, does not address how DrosoMating compares with or advances on other existing tools for exactly the same purpose, whether it can be used for studies of other Drosophila species, and/or whether finer aspects of courtship response timing - which depend on proximal female signals to the male - could be extracted with more detailed analyses. Some additional statistical analyses would also help further strengthen the authors' current conclusions.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The study of Drosophila mating behaviors has offered a powerful entry point for understanding how complex innate behaviors are instantiated in the brain. The effectiveness of this behavioral model stems from how readily quantifiable many components of the courtship ritual are, facilitating the fine-scale correlations between the behaviors and the circuits that underpin their implementation. Detailed quantification, however, can be both time-consuming and error-prone, particularly when scored manually. Song et al. have sought to address this challenge by developing DrosoMating, software that facilitates the automated and high-throughput quantification of 6 common metrics of courtship and mating behaviors. Compared to a human observer, DrosoMating matches courtship scoring with high fidelity. Further, the authors demonstrate that the software effectively detects previously described variations in courtship resulting from genetic background or social conditioning. Finally, they validate its utility in assaying the consequences of neural manipulations by silencing Kenyon cells involved in memory formation in the context of courtship conditioning.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) The authors demonstrate that for three key courtship/mating metrics, DrosoMating performs virtually indistinguishably from a human observer, with differences consistently within 10 seconds and no statistically significant differences detected. This demonstrates the software's usefulness as a tool for reducing bias and scoring time for analyses involving these metrics.</p>
<p>(2) The authors validate the tool across multiple genetic backgrounds and experimental manipulations to confirm its ability to detect known influences on male mating behavior.</p>
<p>(3) The authors present a simple, modular chamber design that is integrated with DrosoMating and allows for high-throughput experimentation, capable of simultaneously analyzing up to 144 fly pairs across all chambers.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) DrosoMating appears to be an effective tool for the high-throughput quantification of key courtship and mating metrics, but a number of similar tools for automated analysis already exist. FlyTracker (CalTech), for instance, is a widely used software that offers a similar machine vision approach to quantifying a variety of courtship metrics. It would be valuable to understand how DrosoMating compares to such approaches and what specific advantages it might offer in terms of accuracy, ease of use, and sensitivity to experimental conditions.</p>
<p>(2) The courtship behaviors of Drosophila males represent a series of complex behaviors that unfold dynamically in response to female signals (Coen et al., 2014; Ning et al., 2022; Roemschied et al., 2023). While metrics like courtship latency, courtship index, and copulation duration are useful summary statistics, they compress the complexity of actions that occur throughout the mating ritual. The manuscript would be strengthened by a discussion of the potential for DrosoMating to capture more of the moment-to-moment behaviors that constitute courtship. Even without modifying the software, it would be useful to see how the data can be used in combination with machine learning classifiers like JAABA to better segment the behavioral composition of courtship and mating across genotypes and experimental manipulations. Such integration could substantially expand the utility of this tool for the broader Drosophila neuroscience community.</p>
<p>(3) While testing the software's capacity to function across strains is useful, it does not address the &quot;universality&quot; of this method. Cross-species studies of mating behavior diversity are becoming increasingly common, and it would be beneficial to know if this tool can maintain its accuracy in Drosophila species with a greater range of morphological and behavioral variation. Demonstrating the software's performance across species would strengthen claims about its broader applicability.</p>

<p>This paper introduces &quot;DrosoMating,&quot; an integrated hardware and software solution for automating the analysis of male Drosophila courtship. The authors aim to provide a low-cost, accessible alternative to expensive ethological rigs by utilizing a custom acrylic chamber and smartphone-based recording. The system focuses on quantifying key temporal metrics-Courtship Index (CI), Copulation Latency (CL), and Mating Duration (MD)-and is applied to behavioral paradigms involving memory mutants (orb2, rut).</p>
<p>The development of open-source behavioral tools is a significant contribution to neuroethology, and the authors successfully demonstrate a system that simplifies the setup for large-scale screens. A major strength of the work is the specific focus on automating Copulation Latency and Mating Duration, metrics that are often labor-intensive to score manually.</p>
<p>However, there are several limitations in the current analysis and validation that affect the strength of the conclusions:</p>
<p>First, the statistical rigor requires substantial improvement. The analysis of multi-group experiments (e.g., comparing four distinct strains or factorial designs with genotype and training) currently relies on multiple independent Student's t-tests. This approach is statistically invalid for these experimental designs as it inflates the family-wise Type I error rate. To support the claims of strain-specific differences or learning deficits, the data must be analyzed using Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) to properly account for multiple comparisons and to explicitly test for interaction effects between genotype and training conditions.</p>
    <p>Second, the biological validation using <italic>w<sup>1118</sup></italic> and <italic>y<sup>1</sup></italic> mutants entails a potential confound. The authors attribute the low Courtship Index in these strains to courtship-specific deficits. However, both strains are known to exhibit general locomotor sluggishness (due to visual or pigmentation/behavioral defects). Since &quot;following&quot; behavior is likely a component of the Courtship Index, a reduction in this metric could reflect a general motor deficit rather than a specific lack of reproductive motivation. Without controlling for general locomotion, the interpretation of these behavioral phenotypes remains ambiguous.</p>
<p>Third, the benchmarking of the system is currently limited to comparisons against manual scoring. Given that the field has largely adopted sophisticated open-source tracking tools (e.g., Ctrax, FlyTracker, JAABA), the utility of DrosoMating would be better contextualized by comparing its performance - in terms of accuracy, speed, or identity maintenance - against these existing automated standards, rather than solely against human observation.</p>
<p>Finally, the visual presentation of the data hinders the assessment of the system's temporal precision. While the system is designed to capture time-resolved metrics, the results are presented primarily as aggregate bar plots. The absence of behavioral ethograms or raster plots makes it difficult to verify the software's ability to accurately detect specific transitions, such as the exact onset of copulation.</p>

<body>
<p>Thank you very much for the constructive feedback on our manuscript, &quot;Simple Methods to Acutely Measure Multiple Timing Metrics among Sexual Repertoire of Male Drosophila,&quot; and for the opportunity to address the reviewers' comments. We appreciate the time and effort the reviewers have invested in evaluating our work, and we agree that their suggestions will significantly strengthen the manuscript.</p>
<p>We are currently working diligently to address all the concerns raised in the public reviews and recommendations. Below is an outline of the major revisions we plan to implement in the revised version:</p>
<p>(1) Statistical Rigor and Analysis</p>
<p>We acknowledge the statistical limitations pointed out by Reviewer #2. We will re-analyze the multi-group data in Figures 3 and 4 using One-way and Two-way ANOVA with appropriate post-hoc tests (e.g., Tukey's HSD), respectively, to properly account for multiple comparisons and interaction effects between genotype and training conditions.</p>
<p>(2) Comparison with Existing Tools</p>
<p>As suggested by both reviewers, we will provide a detailed comparison of DrosoMating with established automated tracking systems (e.g., FlyTracker, JAABA, Ctrax)，and specific use cases where DrosoMating offers distinct advantages in terms of cost, accessibility, and ease of use for high-throughput screening.</p>
<p>(3) Control for Locomotor Activity</p>
    <p>To address the potential confound of general locomotor deficits in <italic>w<sup>1118</sup></italic> and <italic>y<sup>1</sup></italic> mutants, we will calculate and present general locomotion metrics (e.g., average velocity, total distance traveled) from our tracking data to dissociate motor defects from specific courtship deficits.</p>
<p>(4) Software Capabilities and Cross-Species Applicability</p>
<p>We will clarify how DrosoMating handles fly identification during mating (including occlusion management). We will also discuss or test the software's applicability across different *Drosophila* species, as requested.</p>
<p>(5) Minor Corrections</p>
<p>We will address all textual errors, standardize terminology (e.g., &quot;Mating Duration&quot; vs. &quot;Copulation Duration&quot;), improve figure legibility, and provide complete statistical details for all figures.</p>
<p>We believe these revisions will substantially improve the rigor, clarity, and utility of our manuscript. We aim to resubmit the revised version within the standard timeframe and will ensure the preprint is updated accordingly.</p>
