<abstract><p>Cancer repeatedly exploits attributes fundamental for morphogenesis to advance malignancy and metastasis. This is illustrated by lineage specific transcription factors that regulate neural crest migration representing frequent drivers of malignancy. One such example is the <italic>forkhead</italic> transcription factor FOXC1 where gain of function is a feature of diverse cancers that is associated with an unfavourable prognosis. Using RNA-, ChIP-sequencing and CRISPR interference, we show that Foxc1 binds a locus in a region of closed chromatin to induce expression of Arhgap36, a tissue-specific inhibitor of Protein Kinase A. Because PKA is a core Hedgehog (Hh) pathway inhibitor, Foxc1’s induction of Arhgap36 expression increases Hh activity. The function of Sufu, a PKA substrate and a second essential Hh pathway inhibitor, is likewise impaired. The resulting increased Hh pathway output is resistant to pharmacological inhibition of <italic>Smoothened</italic>, a phenotype of more aggressive cancers. The Foxc1-Arhgap36 relationship identified in murine cells was further evaluated in neuroblastoma, a neural crest derived pediatric malignancy. This demonstrated in a cohort of 1348 patients that high levels of ARHGAP36 are predictive of improved five-year survival. Accordingly, this study has identified as a novel transcription factor which enhances ARHGAP36 expression, one that induces Hh activity in multiple tissues during development. It also establishes a model by which increased levels of FOXC1 via ARHGAP36 and PKA inhibition dysregulate multiple facets of Hh signaling, and provides evidence demonstrating relevance to a common neural-crest derived malignancy.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The neural crest comprises a multi-potent stem cell population that contributes to formation of diverse tissues. Through an epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) that permits delamination from the neural plate, the acquisition of mesenchymal characteristics enables neural crest cells to transition towards a migratory phenotype. During a frequently lengthy path, neural crest cells proliferate, generating precursor cells that populate targets in multiple tissues, and so contribute to the formation of diverse organs. Such attributes essential to embryonic morphogenesis, are reminiscent of the invasive steps efficiently co-opted by cancer cells to drive malignancy and metastasis.</p>
<p>The lineage-specific transcription factors that regulate neural crest development represent frequent drivers of malignancy. An example of this paradigm is the <italic>forkhead</italic> box transcription factor <italic>FOXC1</italic>, that influences the migration and differentiation of neural crest cells. In addition to key roles in brain, ocular, cardiac, renal and skeletal development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>], FOXC1 is aberrantly expressed in diverse cancers. This overexpression was first identified in basal like breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>], the subtype with the worst prognosis, and subsequently in at least fifteen additional tumor types, encompassing both solid tumors and hematological malignancies, such as AML [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>]. FOXC1 is also a prognostic factor for metastasis and survival, with its expression increasing tumour proliferation, invasion and dissemination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>]. Roles that include EMT induction, cell cycle control, angiogenesis, and regulation of stem cell populations are thought to promote FOXC1’s adverse oncological effects. However, despite such insights, the precise mechanisms behind FOXC1’s contributions to diverse malignancies remain incompletely defined.</p>
<p>Dysregulation of Hedgehog (Hh) signaling occurs frequently in sporadic and inherited cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>] and is estimated to underlie some 30% of malignancies. Hedgehog’s critical role in malignancy is linked to the pathway’s regulation of the Glioma (Gli) transcription factors and the requirement of Hh activity to maintain normal and cancer cell stemness. Notably, <italic>FOXC1</italic> and several of its paralogs are able to induce Hh expression and Hh pathway activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>]. The output of the Hh pathway is tightly regulated by three equipotent inhibitors: the Patched transmembrane receptors, Suppressor of Fused (Sufu), and Protein Kinase A (PKA). Of these, PKA is positioned comparatively late in the signal transduction cascade and, by phosphorylating the GLI oncoproteins, directs their conversion from full length active to truncated repressor forms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>]. As a result, PKA controls the transcriptional outcome of Hh signaling. In recent years, a tissue-specific PKA antagonist has been identified. This Rho GTPase activating protein, Arhgap36, alters the balance between activator and repressor categories of GLI by inhibiting PKA, thereby inducing strong Hh pathway activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>].</p>
<p>In this study, RNA- and ChIP-sequencing coupled with CRISPR interference were used to demonstrate that Foxc1 binds a locus located in a region of closed chromatin to induce Arhgap36 expression. In turn, Arhgap36 depletes the levels of PKA and its catalytic subunit PKAC, both strongly activating Hh signaling and making signal transduction less dependent on regulation via <italic>Smoothened</italic>. The oncological relevance of the Foxc1-Arhgap36 relationship is demonstrated in neuroblastoma, a neural crest derived pediatric malignancy where ARHGAP36 levels predict five-year mortality. Consequently, our study identifies a mechanism through which overexpression of FOXC1 dysregulates the Hedgehog pathway and contributes to malignancy.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>To discern pathways by which Foxc1 may contribute to tumorigenesis, <italic>Foxc1</italic> was stably overexpressed in NIH3T3 fibroblasts. A retroviral construct was used that recapitulated the high levels of FOXC1 expression observed in a range of malignancies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>]. After RNA-sequencing, analysis using a stringent false discovery rate (<italic>q</italic> ≤ 0.01; log<sub>2</sub>fold change ≥ 1.0) defined a set of differentially expressed genes that were each distinguished by two independent bioinformatic workflows (DEseq2, and Cufdiff; Table S1). The majority were up-regulated by Foxc1 expression (n=192 genes; total 285; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>A</italic></xref>). Gene-set enrichment analysis demonstrated significant enrichment for cancer invasiveness phenotypes, and malignancies, that importantly included neural crest associated malignancies such as melanoma and neuroblastoma (EMT <italic>P</italic> = 4.8 × 10<sup>−11</sup>; Malignancies <italic>P</italic> = 10<sup>−3</sup> - 10<sup>−4</sup>; Table S2). Also enriched were phenotypes either induced by <italic>FOXC1</italic> mutation, (glaucoma and abnormal intraocular pressure, <italic>P</italic> ≤ 4.7 × 10<sup>−4</sup>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>] or present in <italic>Foxc1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> murine mutants (abnormal skeletal morphology and renal anomalies, <italic>P</italic> = 0.05 - 10<sup>−3</sup>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>]. Finally, genes relevant to Foxc1’s biological functions (angiogenesis, endochondral ossification, and hair follicle development) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>] were also enriched in relevant cell types (vasculature <italic>P</italic> = 2.1 × 10<sup>−5</sup>; neural crest <italic>P</italic> = 3.0 × 10<sup>−4</sup>; Table S2). Together, these results support the differentially expressed genes being representative of Foxc1 functions in development and disease.</p>

<p>20% of the significantly dysregulated genes are implicated in Hh signalling (62 of 285) either as regulators or targets of the pathway (Table S1). Besides a cytokine that regulates inflammation and immunity (Interleukin Receptor 1 antagonist), Arhgap36 mRNA was the most upregulated in the RNA-sequencing dataset (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). To test whether Foxc1 consistently induces Arhgap36 expression in mesenchymal-derived cells, qPCR measurements were performed and strong induction of Arhgap36 mRNA observed after Foxc1 overexpression in several relevant cell lines [C2C12 (murine myoblast) 10<sup>5</sup>-fold, ATDC5 (chondrogenic) 10<sup>2</sup>-fold, NIH3T3 10<sup>3</sup>-fold increase; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>B</italic></xref> and <xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1</xref>]. Moreover, in a Hh signalling reporter cell line (NIH3T3-Gli2-mGFP) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>], Foxc1 overexpression induced Arhgap36 protein expression at levels comparable to ectopically expressed Myc-FLAG tagged Arhgap36 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>C</italic></xref>). Both Foxc1 overexpression and ectopically expressed Arhgap36 elevated protein expression of Gli1, a terminal effector and major readout of Hh pathway activity (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>C</italic></xref>). Notably, the cellular localisation patterns of Foxc1-induced endogenous and ectopically expressed Arhgap36 are similar (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>D</italic></xref>, <xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2<italic>A</italic></xref>). Collectively, these data demonstrate Foxc1’s ability to induce Arhgap36 expression and activate Hedgehog signalling.</p>
<p>To characterize the functional interaction between the transcription factor Foxc1 and Arhgap36, whole genome ChIP-sequencing (ChIP-seq) was performed on Gli2-mGFP NIH3T3 cells stably expressing <italic>Foxc1</italic>. Two independent Foxc1 antibodies were used, together with an isotype-matched control immunoglobulin as control for Foxc1 peak specificity. The number of uniquely mapped 60 bp reads (Input &gt; 5.3 × 10<sup>8</sup>, Foxc1-ChIP 4.8 × 10<sup>8</sup>) corresponds with deep sequencing coverage. Examination of chromatin accessibility demonstrates that, with the exception of embryonic stem cells, the Arhagp36 locus is inactive (<xref rid="figS3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3</xref>), an observation consistent with Arhgap36’s highly restricted tissue expression. Within a 200 kb interval encompassing the Arhgap36 locus, five regions displayed strongly overlapping ChIP-seq peaks with both anti-Foxc1 antibodies (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2<italic>A</italic></xref>). Three (Prox-1 to Prox-3) were 0.2 - 2.5 kb from the transcription start sites, while two (Dist-1, Dist-2) were 55 and 71 kb upstream (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2<italic>A</italic></xref>). Two amplicons were selected within each peak, and ChIP-qPCR demonstrated strongly increased Foxc1 signal at each peak, relative to DNA precipitated using a non-specific normal IgG control (<xref rid="figS4" ref-type="fig">Fig. S4</xref>). Two groups of position weight matrices were significantly enriched in the bulk ChIP-seq peak data (STREME sequence motif discovery algorithm) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2<italic>B</italic></xref>, <xref rid="figS4" ref-type="fig">Fig. S4</xref>). The first comprised consensus sequences closely resembling known Foxc1-binding motifs (<italic>P</italic> = 10<sup>−41</sup> - 10<sup>−65</sup>), while the second corresponded closely with that of Fos-Jun transcription factor dimers (<italic>P</italic> = 10<sup>−13</sup> - 10<sup>−20</sup>, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2<italic>B</italic></xref>, <xref rid="figS5" ref-type="fig">Fig. S5</xref>). Each of the five ChIP-seq peaks contains the identified Foxc1 motifs, supporting Arhgap36 being a direct transcriptional target of Foxc1.</p>

<p>(<bold>A</bold>) ChIP sequencing with independent anti-Foxc1 antibodies revealed substantial peak overlap for both ChIP samples, consistent with high antibody specificity. Peak calling identified five significant ChIP signal regions within ± 100 kb of <italic>Arhgap36</italic> [2 distal, 3 proximal; q-value ≤ 0.05]. (<bold>B</bold>) Within these Foxc1 ChIP peaks, the discovery algorithm STREME identified two major groups of significantly enriched motifs [<italic>p</italic> = 2.8 × 10<sup>−20</sup>, 2.5 × 10<sup>−65</sup>]. The group 1 position weight matrices are highly similar to known Foxc1 motifs, while the group 2 PWMs very closely resemble the heptanucleotide recognition sequence bound by Fos-Jun transcription factor dimers [most prominently Fosl2]. The distribution of both PWM groups in the vicinity of Arhgap36 is shown on plot <bold>A.</bold></p></caption>

<p>We next investigated in a Hh reporter line [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>] if Foxc1 overexpression recapitulated Arhgap36’s augmentation of Hh signaling, via down-regulation of PKA. As expected, ectopic expression of Foxc1 depleted the level of PKAC, PKA’s catalytic subunit (63% reduction, <italic>P</italic> = 1.4 × 10<sup>−7</sup>; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3<italic>A</italic></xref>). Foxc1 overexpression also reduced phosphorylation of threonine 197 in PKAC’s activation loop, a residue essential to PKA enzymatic function and protein stability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>]. This ~70% depletion of pT197 PKAC (<italic>P</italic> = 1.3 × 10<sup>−8</sup>) is analogous to the effect of ectopic Arhgap36 expression in parental NIH3T3 cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3<italic>A</italic></xref>). Immunofluorescent staining demonstrated in cells with ectopic Foxc1 or Arhgap36 expression the near complete absence of PKAC and pT197 PKAC in the cytoplasm, especially at the basal body, where compartmentalized PKA-dependent control of Hh pathway occurs (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3<italic>B</italic></xref>). Notably, in a transduced cell population with heterogeneous Foxc1 expression, PKAC signal is almost entirely depleted from cells with a high Foxc1 nuclear signal, demonstrating an inverse correlation between levels of PKAC and nuclear Foxc1 immunostaining (<xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2<italic>B</italic></xref>). Similar results were observed in a second cell model, pre-adipocyte cells (3T3-L1) where expression of Foxc1 induced expression of Arhgap36 (albeit at lower levels) and a 40-50% reduction in protein levels of PKAC and pT197 PKAC (<xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2<italic>C,D</italic></xref>). Direct overexpression of Arhgap36 led to strong downregulation of PKAC. These data, from two cell-based systems, demonstrate that Foxc1 expression depletes PKAC, the enzyme essential for promoting repressor forms of Gli, which regulate Hh target gene expression.</p>

<p>We next examined using CRIPSR interference whether steric repression of the five Foxc1 binding loci affected Arhgap36 transcription. Two clones of NIH3T3-Gli2-mGFP cells that overexpress Foxc1 were created that each stably expressed an inactive form of Cas9 fused with the Krüppel-associated box (KRAB) repressor domain of ZIM3 protein. Recruitment of ZIM3 KRAB-dCas9 to each of the five Foxc1-binding regions by retroviral delivery of five separate pools each comprising 3-4 single guide RNAs, altered Arhgap36 expression, although to varying degrees (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4<italic>A</italic></xref>, <xref rid="figS6" ref-type="fig">Fig. S6</xref>). The sgRNA pools targeting Prox-3 and Dist-2 reduced Arghap36 mRNA expression by 98-99% and 67-76% respectively (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4<italic>A</italic></xref>). In both cases, reduced expression of Arhgap36 was associated with lower levels of Gli1 mRNA, and the degree of Arhgap36 mRNA reduction correlated with the decrease in Gli1 mRNA levels. Western immunoblot analysis confirmed that silencing either the Prox-3 or Dist-2 regions decreased Arhgap36 protein expression. This in turn correlated with an increase in PKAC and pT197 PKAC levels and a reduction in Gli1 protein levels (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4<italic>B</italic></xref>). Since these data support Prox-3 and Dist-2 functioning, respectively, as promoter and distal enhancer for murine <italic>Arhgap36</italic>, evolutionary conservation of the Foxc1-binding loci was assessed. Multiple alignment across 60 vertebrates (Multiz) and measurements of evolutionary conservation (PhastCons) demonstrated that Prox-3 and Dist-2 are both conserved in placental, but not in marsupial mammals, nor in other vertebrates (<xref rid="figS7" ref-type="fig">Fig. S7</xref>). Multiple potential binding motifs for Foxc1 and Fos-Jun family transcription factors were identified in both regions; as illustrated by 16 Foxc1-binding motifs in both Prox-3 (8 motifs) and Dist-2 (8 motifs) of the murine locus, that were conserved or partially conserved in human (<xref rid="figS7" ref-type="fig">Fig. S7</xref>; Table S3). Taken together, the data presented support the Prox-3 and Dist-2 regions functioning as cis-regulatory elements for murine <italic>Arhgap36</italic>, and other placental mammals, including human.</p>

<p>Since PKA depletion de-represses Hh signaling, the pathway activation is predicted to become less dependent on Hh ligand, which pharmacologically would manifest as tumour resistance to inhibition of <italic>Smoothened</italic> (<italic>Smo</italic>). To test whether Foxc1 expression induces such ligand-independent Hh signal transduction, Gli1 levels were measured with and without two <italic>Smoothened</italic>-specific antagonists (Sonidegib and Cyclopamine). The results revealed that the Foxc1-induced increase of Gli1 mRNA and protein levels is resistant to inhibition by either antagonist (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5<italic>A,B</italic></xref>). Furthermore, the Foxc1-induced resistance to Sonidegib is phenocopied by the ectopic expression of Arhgap36 (<xref rid="figS8" ref-type="fig">Fig. S8<italic>A</italic></xref>). In both cases Gli1 upregulation, whether by Foxc1 or by Arhgap36 overexpression, is not significantly reduced by co-treatment with Sonidegib. Indeed, Foxc1 overexpression leads to a similar level of Gli1 upregulation in NIH3T3 cells as treatment with a <italic>Smoothened</italic> agonist (SAG), and co-treatment of cells with SAG does not significantly enhance Gli1 levels beyond Foxc1-induced upregulation alone (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5<italic>B</italic></xref>). Consequently, these data demonstrate that Foxc1 induces strong non-canonical activation of Hh signaling, a characteristic of multiple malignancies, including advanced and metastatic tumors.</p>

<p>PKA’s roles regulating the Hh pathway extend beyond repressing Gli activity. PKA also phosphorylates key serine and threonine residues within Sufu. This inhibits ciliary trafficking of Sufu-Gli complexes, resulting in retention of Sufu at the tip of the primary cilium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>]. We found that in addition to substantially increased axonemal tip accumulation of Gli2-mGFP (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6<italic>A</italic></xref>, <xref rid="figS8" ref-type="fig">Fig. S8<italic>B,C</italic></xref>), expression of Foxc1 also increases Sufu levels at the tip of the axoneme 3-fold (<italic>P</italic> ≤ 2 × 10<sup>−10</sup>) while a similar 2-fold increase is induced by ectopic expression of Arhgap36 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6<italic>A-C</italic></xref>). The status of Sufu’s PKA-dependent phosphorylation sites is known to influence Sufu activity. Two of these adjacent serine residues comprise a classical dual phosphorylation site for PKA (pS346) and GSK3β (pS342) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>]. Consequently, the ~50% reduction in levels of Sufu pS342 after Foxc1 (<italic>P</italic> = 6.4 × 10<sup>−5</sup>) or Arhgap36 expression (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6<italic>D</italic></xref>), provides further support for Hh pathway regulation by Foxc1. Together these data demonstrate that the effects of Foxc1 expression on Hh signal transduction involve several core regulators of Hh pathway activity.</p>

<p>The presented data support a model by which Foxc1-dependent Arhgap36 expression attenuates PKA activity and Sufu function. To verify that the observed changes in Sufu and Gli2 ciliary accumulation induced by Foxc1 overexpression are mediated by Arhgap36, shRNA silencing of Arhgap36 was performed in Foxc1-expressing Gli2-mGFP cells (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>). Two different Arhgap36-targeting shRNAs each substantially diminished ciliary Gli2-mGFP accumulation (shRNA1: 35%, shRNA2: 64% reduction; <italic>P</italic> = 4.9 × 10<sup>−7</sup> and 4.5 × 10<sup>−10</sup>; <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7<italic>A</italic>-<italic>C</italic></xref>) while Gli2-mGFP levels in control cells that express very low levels of Arhgap36 were unchanged. The decrease in axonemal Gli2-mGFP correlated with the reduction in Gli1 mRNA (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7D</xref>), and the shRNA that more efficiently inhibited Arhgap36 induced a greater decrease in both Gli2-mGFP accumulation and Gli1 expression. The specificity of Arhgap36 inhibition is apparent from marked reductions in Gli1 and Arhgap36 mRNA expression, while levels of Foxc1 were unaltered (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7D</xref>). Analysis of Gli1 expression in parental Foxc1-expressing NIH3T3 cells treated with the same Arhgap36-targeting shRNA recapitulated the prior findings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS9">Fig. S9</xref>). Taken together, these data demonstrate that the effects of Foxc1 expression on Hh pathway activity are Arhgap36-mediated.</p>

<p>To test the oncologic relevance of the Foxc1 - Arhgap36 relationship, <italic>ARHGAP36</italic> mRNA levels were first surveyed in cancer expression datasets. This revealed high expression in a common pediatric malignancy, neuroblastoma, as well as specific CNS, breast, lung, and neuroendocrine tumors. Due to neuroblastoma’s neural crest origin and Foxc1’s roles in this stem cell population, we focused on neuroblastoma data. Survival was evaluated in three independent neuroblastoma patient cohorts using Kaplan-Meier analyses after stratification into terciles of high, medium and low ARHGAP36 mRNA expression. The highest tercile of <italic>ARHGAP36</italic> expression correlated with a favorable overall survival compared to the lowest: <underline>GSE49711</underline>, 91 vs 63% 5-year survival; <underline>E-MTAB-178191</underline>, 91 vs 61%; <underline>TARGET</underline> study, 60 vs 31%, (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8<italic>A-C</italic></xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>].

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Here we show that the PKA antagonist Arhgap36 is a central gene dysregulated by Foxc1 overexpression, and that this linkage provides new perspectives in Foxc1’s contributions to malignancy. Foxc1’s transcriptional regulation of Arhgap36, and the consequent inhibition of PKA, alters the equilibrium between full length transcriptional GLI activators and truncated transcriptional repressors, weakening regulation and increasing activity of a pathway fundamental to development. It is therefore logical that a transcription factor identified to enhance Arhgap36 expression is one that induces Hh activity in multiple tissues during development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>]. In some contexts, Hedgehog functions as a morphogen that confers positional information, with a gradient of activity specifying individual cell types and behaviors required for establishment of complex tissue patterns [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>]. Increased gene dosage from <italic>FOXC1</italic> copy number variation causes phenotypes indicative of impaired Hedgehog signaling, including cerebellar hypoplasia and anomalous facial skeletal development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>]. Consequently, Foxc1’s ability to induce Arhgap36 expression establishes a new mechanism by which the transcription factor may modulate Hh pathway activity. This has particular relevance for oncology, where dysregulated Hh expression makes major contributions and larger fold increases in FOXC1 expression occur.</p>
<p>A second finding concerns the breadth of alteration to Hh signaling. Foxc1’s induction of Arhgap36 depletes an evolutionary conserved negative regulator of Hh signaling (PKA) from the cytoplasm and base of the primary cilium. Such wide loss of PKA activity should release Gli transcription factors from phosphorylation-induced direct inhibition (in case of Gli2) and proteolytic processing (in case of Gli2 and Gli3). In parallel, Foxc1-induced depletion of PKAC predictably dysregulates the PKA substrate Sufu: a second major negative regulator of the Hh pathway, whose roles encompass development, disease, and notably tumour suppression. Sufu acts as a scaffold between PKA and Gli proteins, that facilitates their phosphorylation and proteolytic processing, while also directly inhibiting transcriptional activity of active Gli forms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>]. The reduced phosphorylation of Sufu and increased translocation of Sufu and Gli2 to the tip of the cilium represent alterations to fundamental features of Hh signal transduction. As Arhgap36 acts independently of Smo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>], another consequence of Foxc1-driven Arhgap36 expression observed in our experiments is acquired resistance of Hh pathway activity to Smo antagonists. Consequently, by altering activity of PKA, Foxc1 overexpression impairs central elements of the Hh pathway resulting in increased transcription of Hh-target genes and, via augmented Smo-independent activity, tumor resistance to <italic>Smoothened</italic> antagonists. Collectively, such properties are consistent with the overexpression of FOXC1 in multiple tumors being associated with more aggressive cancer phenotypes, drug resistance and metastasis.</p>
<p>Forkhead box transcription factors’ ability to access areas of closed chromatin is mediated by a conserved winged-helix DNA binding domain that is structurally similar to histones H1 and H5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>]. This capacity to directly bind DNA targets in condensed chromatin enables pioneer factors to activate enhancers and, by opening condensed chromatin, provide access to transcription factors that lack pioneering ability. The closely correlated ChIP-seq peaks identified in this study, which contain consensus sequences for Foxc1 and Fos-Jun dimers, support coordinated transcription factor binding at the Arhgap36 locus. The consistent co-localisation of these transcription factors’ binding motifs, including in other placental mammals, accords with enrichment of FOSL2 and JUNB motifs at the FOXC1 ChIP-seq peaks noted in a previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>]. Together, such data support a model in which the overexpression of FOXC1, by initiating local opening of chromatin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>], makes the ARHAGP36 locus accessible to other transcription factors to induce gene expression. Such combinatorial control of Arhgap36’s transcriptional regulation is predicted to have heterogeneous effects on Hh pathway activity, varying in tissue and cell-specific manners and being determined by levels of FOXC1 and FOS-JUN dimers.</p>
<p>FOXC1’s induction of Hh signaling via ARHGAP36 and PKA inhibition is expected to modify processes in both development and disease. Since our data were derived with retroviral constructs, where 10-20 fold increases in Foxc1 protein levels reiterate overexpression in FOXC1-associated tumours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>], we evaluated the relevance of the Foxc1-Arhgap36 interaction in human malignancy. Analyses in neuroblastoma, a heterogeneous, life-threatening and common pediatric malignancy that originates from sympathoadrenal neural crest progenitors, revealed higher levels of ARHGAP36 expression were comparatively protective. The 2.8 to 8-fold greater five-year survival identified in three independent patient cohorts suggests ARHAGP36 may represent an informative prognostic factor. Because neuroblastoma treatment regimens frequently impact the development of surviving children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>], the ability to stratify by prognosis may facilitate treatment choice and minimize morbidity for a portion of patients. Although the mechanism(s) mediating this effect remain to be explored, this observation is consistent with the requirement of Hh activity for many tumours to proliferate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>] and for maintenance of stem cell self-renewal, including that of cancer stem cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>].</p>
<p>In summary, dysregulated expression of <italic>FOXC1</italic> is well-implicated in malignancy, with expanding evidence that elevated <italic>FOXC1</italic> levels are associated with increased mortality in breast and hepatic cancer and malignancies as diverse as AML and low grade glioma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>]. In contrast with such progress, determining how FOXC1 promotes malignancy has proved more elusive. This work establishes that overexpression of FOXC1, at levels consistent with FOXC1-associated malignancies, transcriptionally activates Arhgap36 expression which in turn dysregulates multiple fundamental aspects of Hh pathway activity. The presented data further demonstrate that ARHGAP36 levels are predictive of five-year survival in a common pediatric malignancy and identify a biological characteristic that merits further investigation. Overall, this study provides additional mechanistic insight into FOXC1’s capacity for stimulating malignancy.</p>

<caption><title>Functional profiling of the list of differentially expressed genes from File S1.</title> <p>Functional profiling of the list of genes differentially expressed in Foxc1-expressing NIH3T3 cells vs empty vector control [pLXSH] was performed using gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) platform Enrichr [<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://maayanlab.cloud/Enrichr/">https://maayanlab.cloud/Enrichr/</ext-link>]. The list was analysed against multiple gene set libraries and databases. Results demonstrate significant associations between differentially expressed genes and molecular pathways / biological processes / pathological conditions with previous implication of Foxc1, as well as Foxc1-specific cell and tissue expression. Overall, these results indicate that ectopic expression of Foxc1 in NIH3T3 affects functionally relevant targets. Examples include association with ocular and vascular disease [glaucoma p = 5.8 × 10<sup>−4</sup>; intraocular pressure p = 5.9 × 10<sup>−3</sup>; hypertension p = 5.7 × 10<sup>−4</sup>; myocardial ischemia p = 2.4 × 10<sup>−4</sup>; coronary artery disease p = 0.01], vascular development [regulation of angiogenesis p = 9.4 × 10<sup>−5</sup>], bone development [endochondral ossification 2.8 × 10<sup>−4</sup>], a number of mouse skeletal and renal phenotypes [MGI phenotypes]; multiple cancers and cancer invasiveness phenotypes [epithelial mesenchymal transition p = 7.7 × 10<sup>−11</sup>]. Relevant cell and tissue expression signatures [mesenchyme p = 3.4 × 10<sup>−8</sup>; mesenchymal stem cells p = 5.8 × 10<sup>−4</sup>; (mesenchymal) stromal cells p = 1.8 × 10<sup>−6</sup>; vasculature p = 2.7 × 10<sup>−5</sup>; neural crest p = 3.8 × 10<sup>−4</sup>; several skeletal tissues; differentiating osteoblasts p ≤ 1.4 × 10<sup>−6</sup>]. p-values are FDR-adjusted.</p></caption>

<p>This thoughtful and thorough mechanistic and functional study reports ARHGAP36 as a direct transcriptional target of FOXC1, which regulates Hedgehog signaling (SUFU, SMO, and GLI family transcription factors) through modulation of PKAC. Clinical outcome data from patients with neuroblastoma, one of the most common extracranial solid malignancies in children, demonstrate that ARHGAP36 expression is associated with improved survival. Although this study largely represents a robust and near-comprehensive set of focused investigations on a novel target of FOXC1 activity, several significant omissions undercut the generalizability of the findings reported.</p>
<p>(1) It is notable that the volcano plot in Figure 1a does now show evidence of canonical Hedgehog gene regulation, even though the subsequent studies in this paper clearly demonstrate that ARHGAP36 regulates Hedgehog signal transduction. Is this because canonical Hedgehog target genes (GLI1, PTCH1, SUFU) simply weren't labeled? Or is there a technical limitation that needs to be clarified? A note about Hedgehog target genes is made in conjunction with Table S1, but the justification or basis of defining these genes as Hedgehog targets is unclear. More broadly, it would be useful to see ontology analyses from these gene expression data to understand FOXC1 target genes more broadly. Ontology analyses are included in a supplementary table, but network visualizations would be much preferred.</p>
<p>(2) Likewise, the ChIP-seq data in Figure 2 are under-analyzed, focusing only on the ARHGAP36 locus and not more broadly on the FOXC1 gene expression program. This is a missed opportunity that should be remedied with unbiased analyses intersecting differentially expressed FOXC1 peaks with differentially expressed genes from RNA-sequencing data displayed in Figure 1.</p>
<p>(3) RNA-seq and ChIP-seq data strongly suggest that FOXC1 regulates ARHGAP36 expression, and the authors convincingly identify genomic segments at the ARHGAP36 locus where FOXC1 binds, but they do not test if FOXC1 specifically activates this locus through the creation of a luciferase or similar promoter reporter. Such a reagent and associated experiments would not only strengthen the primary argument of this investigation but could serve as a valuable resource for the community of scientists investigating FOXC1, ARHGAP36, the Hedgehog pathway, and related biological processes. CRISPRi targeting of the identified regions of the ARHGAP locus is a useful step in the right direction, but these experiments are not done in a way to demonstrate FOXC1 dependency.</p>
<p>(4) It would be useful to see individual fluorescence channels in association with images in Figure 3b.</p>
<p>(5) Perhaps the most significant limitation of this study is the omission of in vivo data, a shortcoming the authors partly mitigate through the incorporation of clinical outcome data from pediatric neuroblastoma patients in the context of ARHGAP36 expression. The authors also mention that high levels of ARHGAP36 expression were also detected in &quot;specific CNS, breast, lung, and neuroendocrine tumors,&quot; but do not provide clinical outcome data for these cohorts. Such analyses would be useful to understand the generalizability of their findings across different cancer types. More broadly, how were high, medium, and low levels of ARHGAP36 expression identified? &quot;Terciles&quot; are mentioned, but such an approach is not experimentally rigorous, and RPA or related approaches (nested rank statistics, etc) are recommended to find optimal cutpoints for ARHGAP36 expression in the context of neuroblastoma, &quot;specific CNS, breast, lung, and neuroendocrine&quot; tumor outcomes.</p>

<p>FOXC1 is a transcription factor essential for the development of neural crest-derived tissues and has been identified as a key biomarker in various cancers. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying its function remain poorly understood. In this study, the authors used RNA-seq, ChIP-seq, and FOXC1-overexpressing cell models to show that FOXC1 directly activates transcription of ARHGAP36 by binding to specific cis-regulatory elements. Elevated expression of FOXC1 or ARHGAP36 was found to enhance Hedgehog (Hh) signaling and suppress PKA activity. Notably, overexpression of either gene also conferred resistance to Smoothened (SMO) inhibitors, indicating ligand-independent activation of Hh signaling. Analysis of public gene expression datasets further revealed that ARHGAP36 expression correlates with improved 5-year overall survival in neuroblastoma patients. Together, these findings uncover a novel FOXC1-ARHGAP36 regulatory axis that modulates Hh and PKA signaling, offering new insights into both normal development and cancer progression.</p>
<p>The main strengths of the study are:</p>
<p>(1) Identification of a novel signaling pathway involving FOXC1 and ARHGAP36, which may play a critical role in both normal development and cancer biology.</p>
<p>(2) Mechanistic investigation using RNA-seq, ChIP-seq, and functional assays to elucidate how FOXC1 regulates ARHGAP36 and how this axis modulates Hh signaling.</p>
<p>(3) Clinical relevance demonstrated through analysis of neuroblastoma patient datasets, linking ARHGAP36 expression to improved 5-year overall survival.</p>
<p>The main weaknesses of the study are:</p>
<p>(1) Lack of validation in neuroblastoma models - the study does not directly test its findings in neuroblastoma cell models, limiting translational relevance.</p>
<p>(2) Incomplete mechanistic insight into PKA regulation - the study does not fully elucidate how FOXC1-ARHGAP36 regulates PKAC activity at the molecular level.</p>
<p>(3) Insufficient discussion of clinical outcome data - while ARHGAP36 expression correlates with improved survival in neuroblastoma, the manuscript lacks a clear interpretation of this unexpected finding, especially given the known oncogenic roles of FOXC1, ARHGAP36, and Hh signaling.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The focus of the research is to understand how transcription factors with high expression in neural crest cell-derived cancers (e.g., neuroblastoma) and roles in neural crest cell development function to promote malignancy. The focus is on the transcription factor FOXC1 and using murine cell culture, gain- and loss-of-function approaches, and ChIP profiling, among other techniques, to place PKAC inhibitor ARHGAP36 mechanistically between FOXC1 and another pathway associated with malignancy, Sonic Hedgehog (SHH).</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Major strengths are the mechanistic approaches to identify FOXC1 direct targets, definitively showing that FOXC1 transcriptional regulation of ARHGAP36 leads to dysregulation of SHH signaling downstream of ARHGAP36 inhibition of PKC. Starting from a screen of Foxc1 OE to get to ARHGAP36 and then using genetic and pharmacological manipulation to work through the mechanism is very well done. There is data that will be of use to others studying FOXC1 in mesenchymal cell types, in particular, the FOXC1 ChIP-seq.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Work is almost all performed in NIH3T3 or similar cells (mouse cells, not patient or mouse-derived cancer cells), so the link to neuroblastoma that forms the major motivation of the work is not clear. The authors look at ARHGAP36 levels in association with the neuroblastoma patient survival; however, the finding, though interesting and quite compelling, is misaligned with what the literature shows about FOXC1 and SHH, their high expression is associated with increased malignancy (also maybe worse outcomes?). Therefore, ARHGAP36 expression may be more complicated in a tumor cell or may be unrelated to FOXC1 or SHH, leaving one to wonder what the work in NIH3T3 cells, though well done, is telling us about the mechanisms of FOXC1 as an oncogene in neuroblastoma cells or in any type of cancer cell. Does it really function as an SHH activator to drive tumor growth? The 'oncogenic relevance' and 'contribution to malignancy' claimed in the last paragraph of the introduction are currently weakly supported by the data as presented. This could be improved by studying some of these mechanisms in patient-derived neuroblastoma cells with high FOXC1 expression. Does inhibiting FOXC1 change SHH and ARHGAP36 and have any effect on cell proliferation or migration? Alternatively, does OE of FOXC1 in NIH3T3 cells increase their migration or stimulate proliferation in some way, and is this dependent on ARHGAP36 or SHH? Application of their mechanistic approaches in cancer cells or looking for hallmarks of cancer phenotypes with FOXC1 OE (and dependent on SHH or ARHGAP36) could help to make a link with cellular phenotypes of malignant cells.</p>

<p>Thank you for forwarding these helpful and thoughtful reviews - at a time when the review process in some journals can be a bit of a 'bloodsport', it is refreshing to receive such constructive and excellent comments.  We essentially agree with the key points the reviewers have made, and as an interim response provide clarification of two areas:</p>
<p>1. As the reviewers highlighted, genome-wide analysis of ChIP-seq data from Foxc1 over-expression is indeed very worthwhile, and may offer insights for diverse malignancies where FOXC1 is over-expressed.  We have a manuscript in preparation integrating this data set with ATAC-and RNA-seq data to identify genes transcriptionally regulated by elevated levels of Foxc1.  In the interim, our full ChIP-seq data are available via the GEO accession number listed in the manuscript.</p>
<p>2. Analysis in neuroblastoma cell lines and then xenografts is equally important. Experiments manipulating ARHGAP36 levels in human neuroblastoma cell lines are underway, however a detailed mechanistic understanding of how ARHGAP36 influences neuroblastoma prognosis will take time, and lies beyond the scope of the current manuscript.</p>
