<title>Abstract</title><p>Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a multifactorial disease caused by irreversible progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons. Recent studies reported successful conversion of astrocytes into dopaminergic neurons by repressing polypyrimidine tract binding protein 1 (PTBP1), which led to a rescue of motor symptoms in a mouse model for PD. However, the mechanisms underlying this cell type conversion remain underexplored and controversial.

Phenotypic analysis of TH<sup>+</sup> cells indicates that they originated from non-dividing neurons and acquired dopaminergic neuronal markers upon PTBP1 downregulation. While further research is required to fully understand the origin, identity, and function of these newly generated TH<sup>+</sup> cells, our study reveals that the downregulation of PTBP1 can reprogram neurons to mitigate symptoms in PD mice.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a complex and multifactorial disorder, characterized by the progressive and irreversible loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc), which leads to the disruption of the nigrostriatal pathway and depletion of striatal dopamine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bloem et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Gitler et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Moore et al., 2005</xref>). The cause of PD is unknown and only a handful of genetic and environmental risk factors have been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Brown et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">de Lau and Breteler, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Elbaz et al., 2007</xref>; Kalia and Lang, 2015), making the development of a curative therapy challenging. In fact, current treatment strategies mostly focus on slowing down or halting disease progression to alleviate symptoms and maintain the patients’ quality of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Gitler et al., 2017</xref>).</p>
<p>Recently emerging <italic>in vivo</italic> transdifferentiation approaches, which leverage the plasticity of specific somatic cell types, hold great promise for developing therapies for a wide range of neurodegenerative diseases, including PD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Cohen and Melton, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Torper and Götz, 2017</xref>). Astrocytes are of particular interest for such cell fate-switching approaches. First, they are non-neuronal cells and not affected by neurodegeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Yu et al., 2020</xref>). Second, they can acquire certain characteristics of neural stem cells, including multipotency, when activated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Niu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Buffo et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Robel et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Shimada et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Sirko et al., 2013</xref>). Finally, they are highly proliferative upon brain injuries such as neurodegeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Yu et al., 2021</xref>). Several <italic>in vivo</italic> studies have reported successful reprogramming of astrocytes to neurons via overexpression of proneuronal lineage-specific transcription factors, such as NEUROD1 or SOX2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Guo et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Niu et al., 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">2013</xref>). Two recent studies, moreover, have shown that repression of the RNA-binding protein polypyrimidine tract binding protein 1 (PTBP1), which mainly functions as a splicing regulator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Valcárcel and Gebauer, 1997</xref>), efficiently converts astrocytes into dopaminergic neurons (DANs) in the SNc. Consequently, this led to the restoration of the nigrostriatal pathway and striatal dopamine levels, as well as rescue of motor deficits in a chemically-induced mouse model of PD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Qian et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Zhou et al., 2020</xref>). However, since the publication of these two studies in 2020, stringent lineage-tracing strategies have revealed that neither quiescent nor reactive astrocytes convert to DANs upon PTBP1 depletion in the SNc or striatum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Chen et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Hoang et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Wang et al., 2021</xref>), fueling widespread debate about the origin of these <italic>de novo</italic> generated DANs and their ability to alleviate motor deficits in PD mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Arenas, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Jiang et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Qian et al., 2021</xref>).</p>
<p>In this study, we used adenine base editors (ABEs) to install a loss-of-function splicing mutation in the <italic>Ptbp1</italic> gene in astrocytes or neurons. Using a chemically-induced PD mouse model, we show that downregulation of neuronal rather than astroglial PTBP1 in the SNc and striatum generates TH<sup>+</sup> cell populations and improves forelimb akinesia and spontaneous rotations in PD mice.</p>

<title>Adenine base editing effectively downregulates PTBP1 in cell lines</title>
<p>Base editors (BEs) are CRISPR-Cas derived genome engineering tools that allow the precise conversion of A-T to G-C (adenine BEs, ABEs) or C-G to T-A (cytidine BEs, CBEs) base pairs in cell lines as well as post-mitotic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Gaudelli et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Koblan et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Komor et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Levy et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Villiger et al., 2018</xref>). BEs can thus be applied to precisely disrupt canonical splice sites and permanently eliminate gene function <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Kluesner et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Musunuru et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Rothgangl et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Winter et al., 2019</xref>). To achieve effective and permanent repression of PTBP1, we sought to utilize ABEs to mutate canonical splice sites. First, to assess if adenine base editing can be used to effectively disrupt PTBP1 expression, we designed seven sgRNAs targeting canonical <italic>Ptbp1</italic> splice donor or acceptor sites in murine Hepa1-6 cells (hereafter referred to as Hepa; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref> – figure supplement 1). Plasmids expressing the sgRNAs were co-delivered with <italic>Sp</italic>Cas-, <italic>Sp</italic>G-, or <italic>Sp</italic>Cas-NG-ABE-expressing plasmids into Hepa cells, and genomic DNA was isolated at 5 days post-transfection for analysis by deep sequencing. In line with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Kluesner et al., 2021</xref>), base editing activity was higher at splice donor sites, with the highest editing rates at the exon-intron junctions of exon 3 (92.9±1.0% for <italic>Sp</italic>G-ABE8e) and 7 (85.0±7.2% for <italic>Sp</italic>Cas-ABE8e; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">figure 1</xref> – figure supplement 1). Next, we validated whether both sgRNAs resulted in a reduction of transcript and protein levels. Average editing rates of 77% (sgRNA-ex3) and 73% (sgRNA-ex7) on genomic DNA (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref> – figure supplement 2) resulted in approximately 70% and 50% reduction of <italic>Ptbp1</italic> transcripts in Hepa cells (Figure 1 – figure supplement 2), leading to a substantial reduction in PTBP1 protein levels and a significant increase in the transcription of exons known to be repressed by PTBP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Han et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Li et al., 2014</xref>) (Figure 1 – figure supplement 2).</p>

<p>To analyze whether PTBP1 can also be downregulated by adenine base editing in neuronal and astroglial cells, we repeated experiments with sgRNA-ex3 and the ABE8e-<italic>Sp</italic>G variant in the neuronal Neuro2a and astroglial C8-D1A cell lines (hereafter referred to as N2a and C8-D1A). Compared to Hepa cells (92.9±1.0%; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">figure 1</xref> – figure supplement 2), editing rates were lower in both cell lines (N2a: 64±7.9%; C8-D1A: 62.7±15.1%; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">figure 1A</xref>). Nevertheless, we again detected a substantial reduction of <italic>Ptbp1</italic> mRNA and PTBP1 protein levels (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B and C</xref>). Notably, editing of the canonical splice donor at exon 3 generated alternative <italic>Ptbp1</italic> splice sites in all three cell lines (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref> – figure supplement 3), which, however, did not result in functional PTBP1 protein (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>; figure 1 – figure supplement 2). Based on these results, we decided to use sgRNA-ex3 in combination with the <italic>Sp</italic>G-ABE8e variant for <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments.</p>

<title>Downregulation of PTBP1 in neurons of the SNc generates TH<sup>+</sup> cells</title>
<p>To study the effect of PTBP1 repression on an injured nigrostriatal circuit in mice, we first induced a unilateral lesion in the medial forebrain bundle (mfb) using the dopamine analogue 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">figure 2</xref> – figure supplement 1), which is toxic to DANs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">da Conceição et al., 2010</xref>). 5 weeks after the introduction of a lesion, we quantified the loss of TH<sup>+</sup> DANs in the SNc and dopamine (DA) fibers in the striatum by histology (Figure 2 – figure supplement 1). As expected, 6-OHDA induced a severe unilateral lesion in the nigrostriatal pathway (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref> – figure supplement 1), characterized by an average 97% reduction in the number of TH<sup>+</sup> DANs in the SNc ipsilateral to the injection site (intact hemisphere: 3033±801 TH<sup>+</sup> cells; lesioned hemisphere: 106±89 TH<sup>+</sup> cells; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">figure 2</xref> – figure supplement 1) and an average 92% decrease in corresponding striatal DA fibers (dorsal and ventral; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">figure 2</xref> – figure supplement 1). In line with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Chen et al., 2022</xref>), we also observed a sharp increase in activated astrocytes, as indicated by the upregulation of the intermediate filament protein GFAP (glial fibrillary acidic protein; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">figure 2</xref> – figure supplement 1). Finally, we analyzed perturbations in spontaneous motor activities following the 6-OHDA lesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Boix et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Glajch et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Iancu et al., 2005</xref>) and found that ipsilateral rotations and contralateral forelimb akinesia were significantly increased (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref> – figure supplement 1).</p>

<p>In order to target PTBP1 in astrocytes or neurons of 6-OHDA-induced PD mice, we designed adeno-associated viral vectors (AAVs) expressing the <italic>Sp</italic>G-ABE8e variant under the control of the astrocyte-specific short GFAP promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Lee et al., 2008</xref>) (hereafter referred to as AAV-GFAP), or the neuron-specific human synapsin 1 promoter (hsyn) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Kügler et al., 2003</xref>) (hereafter referred to as AAV-hsyn). Both AAVs additionally express sgRNA-ex3 under the human U6 promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Duvoisin et al., 2012</xref>). As a non-targeting control, we generated an AAV vector that expresses <italic>Sp</italic>G-ABE8e from the ubiquitous Cbh promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Gray et al., 2011</xref>), but does not contain sgRNA-ex3 (hereafter referred to as AAV-ctrl). Since ABE8e exceeds the packaging capacity of a single AAV (∼5 kb including ITRs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Grieger and Samulski, 2005</xref>), we used the intein-mediated protein trans-splicing system from <italic>Nostoc punctiforme</italic> (<italic>Npu</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Li et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Truong et al., 2015</xref>) to split the ABE for expression from two separate AAVs (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref> – figure supplement 2). We packaged intein-split ABE8e expression vectors into AAV-PHP.eB capsids and delivered particles to the SNc of C57BL/6J mice 5 weeks after the introduction of the unilateral 6-OHDA lesion (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). 12 weeks after AAV treatment at a dose of 2×10<sup>8</sup> vector genomes (vg) per animal we assessed whether the injured nigrostriatal pathway was reconstituted (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>).</p>
<p>When we first analyzed animals treated with AAV-ctrl, we observed an average 99% reduction of TH<sup>+</sup> cells in the SNc of lesioned animals (intact hemisphere: 807±300 TH<sup>+</sup> cells; lesioned hemisphere: 10±5 TH<sup>+</sup> cells; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B and C</xref>). When we next analyzed animals treated with AAV-hsyn to downregulate PTBP1 in neurons, we observed a restoration of on average 10% of TH<sup>+</sup> cells compared to the intact hemisphere (intact hemisphere: 463±159 TH<sup>+</sup> cells; lesioned hemisphere: 49±23 TH<sup>+</sup> cells; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B and D</xref>). However, unlike Qian <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Qian et al., 2020</xref>), we did not detect DA fibers in the striatum, suggesting that TH<sup>+</sup> cells generated in the SNc did not form striatal projections (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E and F</xref>; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">figure 2</xref> – figure supplement 3). Furthermore, when we analyzed animals treated with AAV-GFAP to downregulate PTBP1 in astrocytes, we did not observe TH<sup>+</sup> cells above control levels (intact hemisphere: 683±176 TH<sup>+</sup> cells; lesioned hemisphere: 12±6 TH<sup>+</sup> cells; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">figure 2C and D</xref>; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">figure 2</xref> – figure supplement 3).</p>
<p>Taken together, our results suggest that PTBP1 downregulation in neurons of the SNc generates TH<sup>+</sup> cells; however, unlike endogenous DANs in the SNc, they do not project to the striatum.</p>

<title>Downregulation of PTBP1 in neurons of the striatum generates TH<sup>+</sup> cells and increases striatal dopamine levels</title>
<p>Since the observed TH<sup>+</sup> neurons in the SNc were not able to generate projections to reconstruct the nigrostriatal pathway, we next tested whether we could bypass the lack of striatal projections by generating TH<sup>+</sup> cells directly in the striatum. We therefore delivered AAV-hsyn into the striatum of C57BL/6J mice, which were pre-treated with 6-OHDA to generate unilateral lesions. Confirming the unilateral impairment of the nigrostriatal pathway, analysis of brain sections at 12 weeks post-treatment revealed an average 99% reduction of TH<sup>+</sup> cells in the lesioned SNc and no DA projections to the striatum (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref> – figure supplement 1). When we quantified TH<sup>+</sup> cells in brain sections of the striatum, we found 106±38 TH<sup>+</sup> cells in mice treated with AAV-hsyn compared to no TH<sup>+</sup> cells in the lesioned hemisphere of animals treated with AAV-ctrl (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). To further assess whether these TH<sup>+</sup> cells are capable of synthesizing dopamine, we dissected striata of lesioned and unlesioned hemispheres and quantified dopamine levels by high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">figure 3</xref> – figure supplement 2). Importantly, base edited animals showed an approximately 2.5-fold increase in the concentration of striatal dopamine (AAV-hsyn: 4.4±2.6 nmol/g protein; AAV-ctrl: 1.7±0.7 nmol/g protein) and the dopamine metabolite 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid <bold>(</bold>DOPAC; AAV-hsyn: 8.2±3.9 nmol/g protein; AAV-ctrl: 3.1±1.8 nmol/g protein) in the lesioned hemisphere (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">figure 3</xref> – figure supplement 2).</p>

<title>Characterization of TH<sup>+</sup> cells in the striatum</title>
<p>To characterize these TH<sup>+</sup> cells in more detail, we co-stained them for the pan-neuronal marker NeuN. While virtually all TH<sup>+</sup> cells in the intact SNc were co-stained for NeuN (99.0±0.1%; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">figure 3B</xref>), a fraction of TH<sup>+</sup> cells in the lesioned SNc (hsyn: 8.0±6.2%; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">figure 3B</xref>) and striatum of AAV-hsyn-treated animals (22.5±11.8%; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">figure 3C</xref>) was not labelled by NeuN, indicating heterogeneity in these TH<sup>+</sup> cell populations. In addition, we observed a significant difference in the surface area and Feret’s diameter between TH/NeuN double-positive cells in the lesioned striatum compared to endogenous DANs in the intact SNc, or compared to generated TH/NeuN double-positive cell bodies in the lesioned SNc of AAV-hsyn-treated mice (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>). These results suggest that differences in the local microenvironment might affect the formation of TH<sup>+</sup> neurons upon PTBP1 downregulation. Further supporting this hypothesis, and in line with recent work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Qian et al., 2020</xref>), injection of AAV-hsyn in the visual cortex did not generate TH<sup>+</sup> cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref> – figure supplement 3; n=174 Cas9/NeuN double-positive cells).</p>
<p>Next, we assessed if TH<sup>+</sup> cells in the striatum were generated from dividing neural progenitors or from mature, non-dividing neurons. We therefore supplied 6-OHDA-lesioned mice after AAV-hsyn treatment with bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU)-containing drinking water for 12 weeks (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref> – figure supplement 4). After confirming successful BrdU labeling of proliferating cells in the dentate gyrus (DG; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">figure 3</xref> – figure supplement 4), we performed BrdU/NeuN/TH co-staining expeirments with striatal sections. Microscopic analysis of 163 TH/NeuN double-positive cells revealed no co-labeling with BrdU (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref> – figure supplement 4), indicating that TH<sup>+</sup> cells were not generated <italic>de novo</italic> and rather originated from non-proliferating mature neurons.</p>
<p>To further characterize the identity and differentiation state of these TH<sup>+</sup> cells, we performed iterative immunofluorescence imaging (4i) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Cole et al., 2022</xref>) on tissue sections. After successful validation of antibody specificities (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref> – supplement 1), we performed two 4i rounds using markers for neural stem cells (SOX2), immature neurons (DCX), dopaminergic neurons (TH and DAT), and mature neurons (NeuN and CTIP2). While only a small fraction of TH<sup>+</sup> cells were labeled for markers of neural stem cells or immature neurons (SOX2: 7.5±1.5%; DCX: 0.9±0.9%), the majority of TH<sup>+</sup> cells expressed the adult neuronal marker NeuN (84.4±3.5%; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">figure 4A</xref>, B). Interestingly, 45.5±10.0% were additionally labeled with CTIP2, a marker for medium spiny neurons, and 90.3±3.5% expressed the dopaminergic marker DAT, further corroborating that these cells are mature neurons that are able to synthesize dopamine.</p>

<title>Neuronal PTBP1 repression alleviates drug-free motor dysfunction in PD mice</title>
<p>Next, we evaluated whether neuronal and/or astroglial base editing of PTBP1 in the SNc and/or striatum could restore motor functions in mice with a unilateral 6-OHDA lesion. We first performed two common drug-free behavioral tests: the cylinder test to quantify the asymmetry of spontaneous rotations and the stepping test to quantify contralateral forelimb akinesia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Boix et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Glajch et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Iancu et al., 2005</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we applied adenine base editing to install <italic>Ptbp1</italic> splice mutations in astrocytes and neurons in the 6-OHDA-induced PD mouse model. Delivery of AAV vectors to the SNc led to the formation of TH<sup>+</sup> cells and rescue of spontaneous behaviors when a neuronal promoter was employed to drive ABE expression. However, DA projections to the striatum were absent, indicating that reconstitution of the nigrostriatal pathway, which connects the SNc with the dorsal striatum (Kalia and Lang, 2015), is unlikely the mechanism underlying the observed phenotypic rescue. Supporting this hypothesis, downregulation of neuronal PTBP1 in the striatum of 6-OHDA-lesioned mice also led to the formation of TH<sup>+</sup> cells and a rescue of spontaneous behaviors.</p>
<p>Two previous studies suggested that PTBP1 downregulation in the SNc, using shRNA-mediated knockdown or knockdown via CRISPR-CasRx expressed under the GFAP promoter, led to the conversion of astrocytes into functional DANs in 6-OHDA-lesioned mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Qian et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Zhou et al., 2020</xref>). However, recent lineage tracing studies found that neither quiescent nor reactive astrocytes in the SNc convert to DANs upon PTBP1 downregulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Chen et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Wang et al., 2021</xref>). Instead, these studies hypothesized that leaky activation of the GFAP promoter in endogenous neurons might have been misinterpreted as astrocyte to neuron conversion. Our study contributes to this recently growing body of evidence that targeting astroglial PTBP1 does not induce the conversion of astrocytes into DANs, and that neurons are the origin of the generated TH<sup>+</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Chen et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Wang et al., 2021</xref>). Whether PTBP1 depletion in astrocytes or oligodendrocytes can reprogramm neuronal populations in other brain regions, as recently reported in Maimon et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Maimon et al., 2021</xref>) and Weinberg at al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Weinberg et al., 2017</xref>), needs further evaluation.</p>
<p>When we downregulated neuronal PTBP1 in the striatum of 6-OHDA-induced PD mice, we observed an increase in striatal dopamine levels, suggesting that the generated striatal TH<sup>+</sup> cells might be a source of basal levels of dopamine. While these levels might have a similar effect as pharmacological replenishment of dopamine levels in PD patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Poewe et al., 2017</xref>), the increase in dopamine levels was modest (2.5-fold) and insufficient to improve drug-induced behaviors in 6-OHDA-lesioned PD mice. In comparison, 6-OHDA lesioned rats, treated with the dopamine precursor L-DOPA, displayed an approximately 80-fold increase in dopamine levels in the striatum upon treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Kannari et al., 2000</xref>). This suggests that PTBP1 downregulation via adenine base editing is likely not a viable therapeutic strategy. Identifying and characterizing other genes that drive reprogramming of endogenous neurons into DANs could reveal more efficient and thus clnically translatable treatment approaches. For such follow-up studies, combining genome editing with single-cell RNAseq and stringent lineage-tracing technologies could be a powerful strategy.</p>

<title>Stereotactic injections in mice</title>
<p>Unless stated otherwise, adult female C57BL/6J mice at P50-P60 were used to introduce a unilateral lesion in the medial forebrain bundle. Buprenorphine [0.1 mg/kg bodyweight], was administered to mice subcutaneously 30 min prior to surgery. Animals were anesthetized using isoflurane (5% isoflurane with 1000 mL/min in 100% O<sub>2</sub>) and placed into a stereotaxic mouse frame on a warming surface to maintain body temperature. Anesthesia was maintained at 1.5-2.5% isoflurane with 400 mL/min in 100% O<sub>2</sub> during surgeries. Mice were pre-treated with desipramine [25 mg/kg bodyweight] and pargyline [5 mg/kg bodyweight] 30 min before the injection of 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) was performed. 6-OHDA was dissolved in 0.02% ascorbate/saline solution at a concentration of 15 mg/mL and used within a maximum of 3h. 3.6 μg of 6-OHDA were injected into the medial forebrain bundle (mfb) at the following coordinates (relative to bregma): –1.2 mm anteroposterior (AP); 1.3 mm mediolateral (ML); –5 mm dorsoventral (DV). Sham-injected mice were injected with 0.02% ascorbate/saline solution. Injections were performed using a 5μL Hamilton syringe with a 33G needle at a speed of 0.05 μL/min. The needle was slowly removed 3 min after the injection and the wound was sutured using Vicryl 5-0 suture (Ethicon). Animals with unilateral lesions received extensive post-operative care for two weeks. After the lesion, animals received daily glucose injections, and kitten milk (Royal Canin) for one week to support recovery.</p>
<p>4-5 weeks after the introduction of the 6-OHDA lesion, AAVs were injected into the substantia nigra, striatum, or visual cortex at the following coordinates (relative to bregma): –3.0 mm anteroposterior (A/P), 1.2 mm mediolateral (M/L), –4.5 mm dorsoventral (D/V) for the substantia nigra pars compacta; 0.38 mm A/P, 1.8 mm M/L, –4:0.4:-2.4 mm D/V for the striatum; and –4.5 mm A/P, 2.7 mm ML, 0.35 mm D/V for the visual cortex.

<title>Behavioral assays</title>
<p>Behavior experiments were performed at 4 weeks after the 6-OHDA lesion and 12 weeks after delivery of the treatment. Scientists performing and analyzing behavioral data were blinded during the study. To analyze spontaneous rotations during the dark phase of the light cycle, mice were individually placed into a glass cylinder (10cm diameter, 14cm height) and after 1min of habituation mouse behavior was recorded from the bottom using a digital camera. For assessment of spontaneous rotations after treatment, animals were first habituated to the experimental environment on three separate days. Full body ipsi– and contralateral turns (360°) were counted for 10min. A frame-by-frame video player (VLC media player) was used for scoring. Data are expressed as a percentage of ipsilateral rotations from total rotations.</p>
<p>To assess forelimb akinesia during the light phase of the light cycle, we quantified forelimb usage in the stepping test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Blume et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Olsson et al., 1995</xref>). First, the animal was allowed to settle at one edge of the table (∼2s) with all limbs on the table. Next, the experimenter lifted the hind legs of the mouse by pulling up the tail, leaving only the forepaws touching the table. Animals were pulled backwards by the tail at a steady pace of approximately 1m in 3-4s for a total distance of 1m. Two trials of three consecutive repetitions were performed per animal with at least 10min break between the two trials. Behavior was recorded from the side using a digital camera and the number of adjusting steps from both forepaws was counted.

<p>For assessing drug-induced rotations, D-amphetamine (5 mg/kg bodyweight; Sigma-Aldrich) or apomorphine (0.5 mg/kg bodyweight; Sigma-Aldrich) was administered to mice via intraperitoneal injections. Following the injection, mice were placed in a recovery cage for 10min. Afterwards, mice were placed in a cylinder (10cm diameter, 15cm height) and habituated for 1min. Rotations induced by D-amphetamine or apomorphine were recorded from the bottom for 10min using a digital camera and only fully-body turns (360°) were counted as previously described. Data are expressed as percentage of ipsilateral or contralateral rotations from total rotations.</p>

<title>Trans-cardiac perfusion, brain isolation, and dissection of brain regions</title>
<p>Sodium pentobarbital (Kantonsapotheke Zürich) was injected via intraperitoneal injection at a dose of 100mg/kg. Complete anesthesia was confirmed by the absence of a toe pinch reflex. Mice were placed on a perfusion stage inside a collection pan and the peritoneal cavity was exposed. The diaphragm was cut through laterally and the rib cage was cut parallel to the lungs, creating a chest “flap”. The flap was clamped in place using a hemostat (Fine Science Tools) and a 25G needle (Sterican), attached to silicon tubing and a peristaltic pump, was inserted into the left ventricle. The right atrium was cut for drainage. Animals were first perfused with ice-cold PBS (Thermo Fisher Scientific) at a rate of 10mL/min, followed by perfusion with ice-cold fixative at the same rate (4% paraformaldehyde, PFA, Sigma-Aldrich). Once the perfusion was complete, mice were decapitated and the skull was removed with scissors and tweezers without inflicting damage to the underlying tissue. The brain was removed using a spatula.</p>
<p>For histology, PFA-perfused brains were post-fixated in 4% PFA for 4h, followed by overnight incubation in 30% sucrose. For neurotransmitter quantifications, brains were isolated, rinsed in PBS, and cut into 1mm slices using an acrylic mouse brain matrix (AgnThos) and razor blades. The striatum was isolated under a stereomicroscope using the mouse brain atlas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Paxinos and Franklin, 2001</xref>).</p>

<title>Immunohistochemistry</title>
<p>Fresh or snap-frozen PFA-fixed brain tissues of C57BL/6J mice were cut into 40μm-thick sections using a microtome. Sections were blocked in PBS supplemented with 5% normal donkey serum (cat. no. ab7475, abcam) and 0.3% Triton X-100 (Sigma-Aldrich) for 1h. Brain sections were incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4°C (rabbit-NeuN, 1:1’000, abcam 177487; mouse-TH; 1:1’000, Immunostar 22941; chicken-GFAP, 1:1’500, abcam ab95231; rat-BrdU, 1:400, Oxford Biotech OBT0030). Donkey anti-rabbit-488 (1:1’000), donkey anti-mouse-594 (1:500), donkey anti-chicken-647 (1:500) and donkey anti-rat-647 (1:500; all from Jackson ImmunoResearch) were used as secondary antibodies and sections were counterstained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, Sigma-Aldrich). Mounting was performed using Prolong Gold Antifade Mountant (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Images were taken with a Zeiss LSM 900 or a Zeiss AxioScan.Z1 slidescanner and analyzed with Fiji (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Schindelin et al., 2012</xref>) or cell profiler (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Stirling et al., 2021</xref>).

Density of striatal fibres in the lesioned hemisphere was quantified as relative fluorescence intensity (FI) compared to the intact hemisphere. Additionally, the FI of the TH staining detected in the corpus callosum of each hemisphere was used for background correction of the FI detected in the striatum of the same hemisphere.

<title>Iterative immunofluorescence imaging (4i) and image analysis</title>
<p>Frozen PFA-fixed brain tissues of C57BL/6J mice were cut into 40μm-thick sections using a microtome. Before mounting the sections, glass-bottomed 24-well plates (Cellvis P24-1.5H-N) were coated with poly-D-lysine (0.1mg/mL, Sigma-Aldrich) for 5min at RT on a shaker. Afterwards, wells were rinsed three times with deionized water and left to dry overnight. Tissue sections were washed three times in PBS and transferred into the coated wells containing 500µL of PBS, which was carefully aspirated with a glass pipette to allow the sections to adhere flat to the bottom. Sections were left to dry until there was no visible liquid remaining around the edges of the sections. Next, tissue sections were rinsed with PBS (3×5min), followed by 1h incubation in blocking solution (PBS supplemented with 3% donkey serum, 0.5% Triton X-100, and 0.025% PFA) at RT. Sections were then incubated in primary antibodies (list in supplementary table 4), diluted in blocking solution, for 3 nights at 4°C. Next, sections were washed in PBS (3×5min), rinsed in blocking solution for 5min, followed by incubation with secondary antibodies and DAPI (1:1000; stock 1mg/mL) for 2h at RT. All following steps were performed under low light conditions to reduce possible fluorophore crosslinking. Last, sections were washed in PBS (3×5min) and imaging buffer (PBS supplemented with N-Acetyl-cysteine at 0.7M final concentration, pH 7.4) was added at least 5min prior to imaging to guarantee penetrance of tissue sections. Once the imaging cycle had finished, sections were rinsed three times with dH<sub>2</sub>0 and incubated in equal amounts of dH<sub>2</sub>0 and elution buffer (3×5min; 0.5M L-glycine, 3M urea, 3M guanidine hydrochloride, 0.07M TCEP-HCl; pH 2.5). Successful elution of each antibody was visually confirmed using a fluoresence microscope. After elution, tissue sections were washed three times in PBS (5min) and then another 4i round was started. A total of 2 imaging cycles were performed.</p>
<p>All 4i z-stacks (image intervals of 0.5µm) were collected on an ImageXpress Confocal HT confocal laser-scanning microscope with a 20x water objective (NA 0.95) using bi-directional scanning. Samples of the same imaging cycle were labeled with the same antibodies and images were collected with identical microscopy settings for laser power, gain, digital offset, pinhole diameter, and z-step. Images from tile scans were exported using MetaXpress and analyzed using Fiji (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Schindelin et al., 2012</xref>). DAPI intensity patterns were used to align image tiles from different staining cycles.</p>

<p>Five days after delivery of the treatment, bromodeoxyuridine was administered to mice at a concentration of 0.8 mg/mL via drinking water. Frozen PFA-fixed brain tissues of BrdU-treated mice were cut into 40μm-thick sections using a microtome. Sections were washed 2×15min and 1×5min in PBS, followed by a 10min incubation in 1M HCl on ice, and a 25min incubation in 2M HCl at 37°C. Next, tissues were rinsed in 0.1M borate buffer (Sigma-Aldrich) for 10min on a shaker at RT. After the tissues were rinsed in PBS for 6×10min, brain tissues were stained as described in the section “Immunohistochemistry”.</p>

<title>Neurotransmitter purification and UHPLC-ECD quantifications</title>
<p>Snap-frozen fresh striata of lesioned or unlesioned hemispheres were used for the purification of neurotransmitters. All materials were kept cold on dry ice during the whole purification procedure and samples were kept under low light conditions on ice. Tissue samples were powderized with 2 pulses (at maximum intensity) using a CryoPrepTM system (Covaris). Equal amounts of powder were transferred to a pre-cooled 2 mL tube. For homogenization of the tissue powder, a metal ball (Qiagen) and 1mL homogenization buffer (100mM Tris-HCl, 2mM EDTA, pH 7.6 supplemented with protease inhibitor tablet) were added to each tube and samples were homogenized for 2×90s at 20 Hz using a TissueLyser II (Qiagen). Next, samples were centrifuged for 20min at maximum speed and 4°C. Lysates were next transferred to fresh pre-cooled tubes and 1M HCl was added to a final concentration of 10% (v/v). Subsequently, lysates were filtered using an Amicon Ultra 0.5 (Sigma-Aldrich) and a table top centrifuge (30min at 4°C and maximum speed). 20µL of the filtered sample was used for quantification of total protein amounts. Protein concentrations were determined using the ABBOT Alinity C System (Abbot, Abbotpark, Illinois, USA, kit-no. 7P5920). 20µL of the filtered sample was used in parallel for quantification of neurotransmitter levels by UHPLC-ECD. Brain monoamine neurotransmitter metabolites were analyzed in the filtered lysate using a modified Thermo Fisher UltiMate 3000 High Sensitivity HPLC Electrochemical System (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, Massachusetts, USA). Injection volume of each sample was 20 µL and separation of the compounds was achieved using an YMC-Hydrosphere UHPLC column (C18 12 nm, S-2.0 µm, 150 x 30 mm, YMC Inc., Wilmington, NC, USA). As a mobile phase, a 56.7mM sodium phosphate buffer, containing 5mM octanesulphonic acid, 50µM EDTA, 0.28% phosphoric acid (85%), and 23% methanol (pH 2.9-3.1, adjust with concentrated 10M NaOH), was used with an isocratic flow rate of 410 µL/min. The column was maintained at 27°C by a surrounding TCC-3000SD column-thermostat. The analytical cell (Coulometric Cell Model 6011RS, Thermo Fisher Scientific) within the electrochemical detector ECD-3000RS (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was adjusted to a 10mV potential and 100µA gain range for the upstream electrode, plus 400mV potential, plus 500nA gain range for the downstream electrode with a response time of 1s. Data was analyzed using the Chromeleon Chromatography Data System (CDS) Software 7.1.9 (Thermo Fisher) and corrected for the protein concentrations of the respective homogenates. All measurements were performed at the clinical chemistry unit of the Kinderspital Zürich.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Recent years have seen spectacular and controversial claims that loss of function of the RNA splicing factor Ptbp1 can efficiently reprogram astrocytes into functional neurons that can rescue motor defects seen in 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-induced mouse models of Parkinson's disease (PD). This latest study is one of a series that fails to reproduce these observations, but remarkably also reports that neuronal-specific loss of function of Ptbp1 both induces expression of dopaminergic neuronal markers in striatal neurons and rescues motor defects seen in 6-OHDA-treated mice. The claims, if replicated, are remarkable and identify a straightforward and potentially translationally relevant mechanism for treating motor defects seen in PD models. However, while the reported behavioral effects are strong and were collected without sample exclusion, other claims made here are less convincing. In particular, no evidence that Ptbp1 loss of function actually occurs in striatal neurons is provided, and the immunostaining data used to claim that dopaminergic markers are induced in striatal neurons is not convincing. Furthermore, no characterization of the molecular identity of Ptbp1-deficient striatal neurons is provided using single-cell RNA-Seq or spatial transcriptomics, making it difficult to conclude that these cells are indeed adopting a dopaminergic phenotype.</p>
<p>Overall, while the claims of behavioral rescue of 6-OHDA-treated mice appear compelling, it is essential that these be independently replicated as soon as possible before further studies on this topic are carried out. Insights into the molecular mechanisms by which neuronal-specific loss of function of Ptbp1 induces behavioral rescue are lacking, however. Moreover, the claims of induction of neuronal identity in striatal neurons by Ptbp1 require considerable additional work to be convincing.</p>
<p>Strengths of the study:</p>
<p>(1) The effect size of the behavioral rescue in the stepping and cylinder tests is strong and significant, essentially restoring 6-OHDA-lesioned mice to control levels.</p>
<p>(2) Since the neurotoxic effects of 6-OHDA treatment are highly variable, the fact that all behavioral data was collected blinded and that no samples were excluded from analysis increases confidence in the accuracy of the results reported here.</p>
<p>Weaknesses of the study:</p>
<p>(1) Neurons express relatively little Ptbp1. Indeed, cellular expression levels as measured by scRNA-Seq are substantially below those of astrocytes and other non-neuronal cell types, and Ptbp1 immunoreactivity has not been observed in either striatal or midbrain neurons (e.g. Hoang, et al. Nature 2023). This raises the question of whether any recovery of Th expression is indeed mediated by the loss of function of Ptbp1 rather than by off-target effects. AAV-mediated rescue of Ptbp1 expression could help clarify this.</p>
<p>(2) It is not clear why dopaminergic neurons, which are not normally found in the striatum, are observed following Ptbp1 knockout. This is very similar to the now-debunked claims made in Zhou, et al. Cell 2020, but here performed using the hSyn rather than GFAP mini promoter to control AAV expression. While this is the most dramatic and potentially translationally relevant claim of the study, this claim is extremely surprising and lacks any clear mechanistic explanation for why it might happen in the first place. This observation is even more surprising in light of reports that antisense oligonucleotide-mediated knockdown of Ptbp1, which should have affected both neuronal and glial Ptbp1 expression, failed to induce expression of dopaminergic neuronal markers in the striatum (Chen, et al. eLife 2022). Selective loss of function of Ptbp1 in striatal and midbrain astrocytes likewise results in only modest changes in gene expression It is critically important that this claim be independently replicated, and that additional data be provided to conclusively show that striatal neurons are indeed expressing dopaminergic markers.</p>
<p>(3) More generally, since multiple spectacular and irreproducible claims of single-step glial-to-neuron reprogramming have appeared in high-profile journals in recent years, a consensus has emerged that it is essential to comprehensively characterize the identity of &quot;transformed&quot; cells using either single-cell RNA-Seq or spatial transcriptomics (e.g. Qian, et al. FEBS J 2021; Wang and Zhang, Dev Neurobiol 2022). These concerns apply equally to claims of neuronal subtype conversion such as those advanced here, and it is essential to provide these same datasets.</p>
<p>(4) Low-power images are generally lacking for immunohistochemical data shown in Figures 3 and 4, which makes interpretation difficult. DAPI images in Figure 3C do not appear nuclear. Immunostaining for Th, DAT, and Dcx in Figure 4 shows a high background and is difficult to interpret.</p>
<p>(5) Insights into the mechanism by which neuronal-specific loss of Ptbp1 function induces either functional recovery, or dopaminergic markers in striatal neurons, is lacking.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The manuscript by Bock and colleagues describes the generation of an AAV-delivered adenine base editing strategy to knockdown PTBP1 and the behavioral and neurorestorative effects of specifically knocking down striatal or nigral PTBP1 in astrocytes or neurons in a mouse model of Parkinson's disease. The authors found that knocking down PTBP1 in neurons, but not astrocytes, and in striatum, but not nigra, results in the phenotypic reorganization of neurons to TH+ cells sufficient to rescue motor phenotypes, though insufficient to normalize responses to dopaminomimetic drugs.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The manuscript is generally well-written and adds to the growing literature challenging previous findings by Qian et al., 2020 and Zhou et al., 2020 indicating that astrocytic downregulation of PTBP1 can induce conversion to dopaminergic neurons in the midbrain and improve parkinsonian symptoms. The base editing approach is interesting and potentially more therapeutically relevant than previous approaches.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The manuscript has several weaknesses in approach and interpretation. In terms of approach, the animal model utilized, the 6-OHDA model, though useful to examine dopaminergic cell loss, exhibits accelerated neurodegeneration and none of the typical pathological hallmarks (synucleinopathy, Lewy bodies, etc.) compared to the typical etiology of Parkinson's disease, limiting its translational interpretation. In addition, there is no confirmation of a neuronal or astrocytic knockdown of PTBP1 in vivo; all base editing validation experiments were completed in cell lines. Finally, it is unclear why the base editing approach was used to induce loss-of-function rather than a cell-type specific knockout, if the goal is to assess the effects of PTBP1 loss in specific neurons. In terms of interpretation, the conclusion by the authors that PTBP1 knockdown has little likelihood to be therapeutically relevant seems overstated, particularly since they did observe a beneficial effect on motor behavior. We know that in PD, patients often display negligible symptoms until 50-70% of dopaminergic input to the striatum is lost, due to compensatory activity of remaining dopaminergic cells. Presumably, a small recovery of dopaminergic neurons would have an outsized effect on motor ability and may improve the efficacy of dopaminergic drugs, particularly levodopa, at lower doses, averting many problematic side effects. Since striatal dopamine was assessed by whole-tissue analysis, which is not necessarily reflective of synaptic dopamine availability, it is difficult to assess whether the ~10% increase in TH+ cells in the striatum was sufficient to improve dopamine function. However, the improvement in motor activity suggests that it was.</p>

<p>This study explores the use of an adenine base editing strategy to knock down PTBP1 in astrocytes and neurons of a Parkinson's disease mouse model, as a potential AAV-BE therapy. The results indicate that editing Ptbp1 in neurons, but not astrocytes, leads to the formation of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)+ cells, rescuing some motor symptoms.</p>
<p>Several aspects of the manuscript stand out positively. Firstly, the clarity of the presentation. The authors communicate their ideas and findings in a clear and understandable manner, making it easier for readers to follow.</p>
<p>The Materials and methods section is well-elaborated, providing sufficient detail for reproducibility.</p>
<p>The logical flow of the manuscript makes sense, with each section building upon the previous one coherently.</p>
<p>The ABE strategy employed by the authors appears sound, and the manuscript presents a coherent and well-supported argument.</p>
<p>Positively, some of the data in this study effectively counteracts previous work in line with more recent publications, demonstrating the authors' ability to contribute to the ongoing conversation in the field.</p>
<p>However, while the in vitro data yields promising results, it may have been overly optimistic to assume that the efficiencies observed in dividing cells will directly translate to in vivo conditions. This consideration is important given the added complexities of vector optimization, different cell types targeted in vitro versus in vivo, as well as unknown intrinsic limitations of the base editing technology.</p>
<p>In addition, certain aspects of the manuscript would benefit from a more in-depth and comprehensive discussion rather than being only briefly touched upon. Such a discussion would enhance the relevance of the obtained results and provide the foundation for improvement when using similar approaches.</p>
