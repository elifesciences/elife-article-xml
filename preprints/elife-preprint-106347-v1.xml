<body>
<p>Adolescence is a secondary critical period, following the perinatal steroid surge, during which juvenile animals undergo extensive physiological maturation of both the body and nervous system as they transition into adulthood <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. This maturation is primarily orchestrated by the hypothalamus-pituitary-gonad (HPG) axis, which activates gonadal cells in the testes and ovaries to release testosterone and estrogen, initiated during adolescence <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>. These circulating sex steroids are essential not only for reproductive maturation but also for guiding the development and execution of sex-specific behaviors through their direct actions on the central nervous system <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. Despite the well-established role of these hormones in shaping behavior, the molecular mechanisms underlying their influence on brain development during adolescence remain poorly understood.</p>
<p>The medial preoptic area (MPOA) is a critical region in the brain, known for its involvement in mating and other social behaviors <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>. Within the MPOA, specific molecularly defined subpopulations of neurons express various neuropeptides and hormone receptors that are closely tied to reproductive behavior <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. Notably, the MPOA is enriched with the expression of steroid hormone receptor genes such as <italic>Esr1,</italic> or estrogen receptor 1 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>, leading us to hypothesize that gonadal steroid signaling during adolescence facilitates the transcriptional maturation of these genetically defined MPOA neurons, which are crucial for the development of mating behaviors. While recent advances have shed light on the molecular diversity of neurons in sexually dimorphic brain regions during the perinatal period <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup> and adulthood <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>, the transcriptional dynamics that occur during adolescence, particularly at the single-cell level, remain largely unexplored. This gap in our understanding represents a critical frontier in unraveling how hormonal signaling shapes the neural circuits that govern sex-specific behaviors.</p>
<p>In this study, we used single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) and hybridized chain reaction fluorescent <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization (HCR-FISH) to investigate the transcriptional dynamics of the MPOA throughout adolescence in both male and female mice. We show that <italic>Esr1</italic> plays a critical role in the transcriptional maturation of GABAergic neurons (Vgat+) within the MPOA, which is essential for the development of mating behaviors. Deleting <italic>Esr1</italic> in Vgat+ neurons disrupted the development of mating behaviors in both sexes, while deletion in glutamatergic neurons (Vglut2+) had no observable effect. Our findings highlight the importance of <italic>Esr1</italic> in guiding sex-specific transcriptional programs during adolescence, revealing distinct hormone-dependent gene expression patterns and gene-regulatory networks crucial for reproductive behaviors.</p>

<title>Selective knockout of <italic>Esr1</italic> in GABAergic or glutamatergic MPOA neurons at pre-adolescence</title>
<p>Previous studies have shown that knocking out <italic>Esr1</italic>, either globally or in specific cell types, reduces mating behavior <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>. However, the role of <italic>Esr1</italic> in genetically defined MPOA neurons during adolescent development remains unclear, as these studies could not easily differentiate between effects occurring during perinatal and adolescent periods. To address this gap and directly test whether the emergence of mating behavior requires steroid hormone signaling in molecularly defined MPOA cell types, we developed an AAV-frtFlex-Cre virus. We injected this virus into the MPOA of <italic>Slc32a1</italic><sup>Flp</sup>::<italic>Esr1</italic><sup>lox/lox</sup> (MPOA<sup>Vgat-Esr1KO</sup>) or <italic>Slc17a6</italic><sup>Flp</sup>::<italic>Esr1</italic><sup>lox/lox</sup> (MPOA<sup>Vglut<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>-Esr1KO</sup>) male and female mice at postnatal day (P) 14-18. This viral strategy allowed for <italic>Esr1</italic> deletion in MPOA GABAergic or glutamatergic neurons, depending on the transgenic mouse line, throughout adolescence (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a-b,i-j</xref> and <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 1a-b</xref>). The onset of genital changes, the maturation of the HPG axis (as determined by the first day of estrus in female mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup> and first day of initiation of sexual behaviors in male mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>), and locomotor behaviors were not altered in MPOA<sup>Vgat-Esr1KO</sup> and MPOA<sup>Vglut<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>-Esr1KO</sup> mice (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c-d,f,k-l,n</xref> and <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 1e-f</xref>).

<title>Transcriptional dynamics of MPOA cell types during adolescent development</title>
<p>To characterize the transcriptional dynamics occurring in the MPOA specific to the adolescent period, we collected tissue from male and female wildtype mice at pre- (P23), mid- (P35) and post- (P50) adolescence timepoints, as well as from mice gonadectomized (GDX) prior to adolescence onset. We used droplet-based scRNAseq to recover the transcriptomes of 58,921 cells and combined the data from all samples across the 8 experimental groups (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref> and <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 2a-e</xref> and Supplementary Table 1). Using known neuronal marker genes <italic>Stmn2</italic> and <italic>Thy1</italic>, we performed high-resolution clustering to focus our subsequent analyses on neuronal cell data (24,627 cells). Thirty-five neuron specific clusters were resolved with 434 marker genes in total (UMIs per cell: 5,395; median genes per cell: 2,592), resulting in 20 GABAergic clusters (Vgat+ clusters, 13,334 cells; 54.4% of neurons), 12 glutamatergic clusters (Vglut2+ clusters, 7,658 cells; 31.1% of neurons), and 3 clusters with mixed glutamatergic and GABAergic markers (3,635 cells; 14.8% of neurons) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref> and <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figs. 2f-l</xref>, <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">3a,j</xref> and Supplementary Table 2), largely consistent with previously published data <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>. To further quantify transcriptional associations between MPOA neuronal cell types, we performed partition-based graph abstraction (PAGA) analysis <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup> to identify cell cluster similarities through a graphical representation of cell differentiation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref>). Consistent with their distinct roles, Vgat+ and Vglut2+ neurons were readily separated in the PAGA graph. Additionally, Vgat+ clusters 2, 4 and 16, all of which expressed <italic>Esr1</italic>, showed higher connectivity compared to other Vgat+ cell type clusters (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref> and <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figs. 2m</xref>, <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">3h-i</xref>), suggesting that Vgat+Esr1+ clusters form a distinct transcriptional unit.</p>

<p>Irrespective of age, sex, and hormonal states, we found that each identified cell type was represented across all 8 experimental groups (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figs. 2d,h-i</xref>, <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>), indicating that new cell types do not emerge during adolescence. However, when assessing gene expression differences across timepoints and sex, we found that hormone-associated differentially expressed genes (HA-DEGs) showed substantial variability across neuronal cell types, ranging from 0 to 88 HA-DEGs per cell type (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d-f</xref> and <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 3a-g</xref> and Supplementary Tables 3-5). We then used these HA-DEGs in regression, co-expression, and AUCell analyses to identify the neuronal types that are transcriptionally sensitive at different hormonal states <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>. Regression analysis revealed a strong enrichment of HA-DEGs in Vgat+Esr1+ neurons (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2e-f</xref>). Consistent with this result, co-expression analysis demonstrated that out of more than 1,000 transcription factors (TFs), <italic>Esr1</italic> was one of the most co-expressed in both sexes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2f</xref> and Supplementary Table 6). Furthermore, in predominantly Vgat+Esr1+ clusters, the aggregate expression of HA-DEGs (AUCell) displayed patterns sensitive to both adolescence and hormonal changes, with the highest expression observed in adult mice (P50) and notably lower expression at P23 and during hormonal deprivation (GDX) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2g</xref>). Together, these analyses demonstrate that sex-hormone signaling during adolescence development significantly influences the transcriptional states of specific MPOA neuronal cell types, particularly cells belonging to Vgat+Esr1+ clusters.</p>
<p>Having identified the distinct transcriptional sensitivity of Vgat+Esr1+ neurons to hormone signaling during adolescence, we next examined whether these neurons might play a direct role during behavior. Given that mating behavior was abolished in MPOA<sup>Vgat-Esr1KO</sup> mice in both sexes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>), this finding, along with our scRNAseq analyses, suggests that Vgat+Esr1+ neurons are critically involved during mating behaviors. To test this hypothesis, we conducted an integrative analysis using our scRNAseq dataset and a publicly available multiplexed error-robust fluorescence <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization (MERFISH) dataset <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup> which identified social behavior-activated POA cells via mating, parenting, and fighting behavior assays using <italic>Fos</italic> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2h</xref>). We clustered the neuronal cells in the MERFISH data and computed the enrichment of <italic>Fos</italic> in the derived clusters. Consistent with previous observations, only a subset of MERFISH Gad1<italic>+</italic> inhibitory clusters showed <italic>Fos</italic> enrichment (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 4a,b</xref>). After integrating our scRNAseq clusters with the MERFISH clusters (Details in Methods. Seurat V3 Integrative Analysis: reference-based integration; label transfers <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>) we were able to identify mating, parenting, and fighting-relevant neuronal clusters within our dataset (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2h</xref> and <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 4c-d</xref> and Supplementary Table 7). We found that <italic>Esr1</italic> was the most enriched and selective gene in the mating-relevant scRNAseq Vgat+ clusters (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2h-i</xref> and Supplementary Table 7). This observation is consistent with a previous study demonstrating that optogenetic stimulation of Vgat+Esr1+ neurons in the MPOA is sufficient to induce sexual behaviors in male mice <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. Collectively, these findings suggest that a subset of Vgat+ clusters expressing <italic>Esr1</italic>, which exhibit transcriptional changes during adolescence, are also functionally linked to mating behaviors in both males and females.</p>
<p>While these differential gene expression (DE) analyses quantify changes in individual gene expression at the pseudo-bulk level (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d</xref> and <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 3b-c</xref>), it does not capture the transitions in transcriptional states of individual cells as they progress through distinct biological stages. These transitions, driven by complex interactions between multiple genes, are key to understanding how single cells change over time <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>. To resolve these dynamic changes, we applied pseudotime analysis (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> and <xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figs. 5</xref>-<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>), a method that infers the transcriptional progression of individual cells through a biological process, such as adolescence, by constructing a principal graph based on combinatorial gene expression patterns <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>.</p>

<p>Recognizing the potential for sex-specific differences in transcriptional progression, we created separate pseudotime manifold models for males and females to capture nuanced dynamics during adolescence <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>. In both sexes, Vgat+Esr1+ trajectories revealed that transcriptional states at P35 and P50 branch and diverge from preadolescence (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a-f</xref> and <xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 5a-f</xref>), suggesting an acceleration of transcriptional dynamics between these timepoints. Neurons from GDX mice, on the other hand, showed arrested transcriptional progression, closely resembling preadolescent states, demonstrating the importance of circulating sex hormones in the maturation of these cells during adolescence. In contrast, Vgat+ cells lacking steroid hormone receptor gene expression (Vgat+ hormone R<sup>Low</sup>) exhibited minimal transcriptional changes in response to hormone changes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3g,i</xref> and <xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 6a-c</xref>). Furthermore, all Vgat+Esr1+ clusters were found to co-express the androgen receptor gene (<italic>Ar</italic>) to a high degree (68.3 – 88.3 %, <xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 6a</xref>). However, Vgat+ clusters expressing <italic>Ar</italic> but not <italic>Esr1</italic> (Vgat+ Esr1-AR+) showed only a moderate transcriptional progression in males and minimal changes in females (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 6b-d</xref>), suggesting that <italic>Esr1</italic> is more influential in driving transcriptional changes during adolescence than <italic>Ar</italic> alone. Lastly, we analyzed Vglut2+ clusters enriched with <italic>Esr1</italic>, and again found only moderate transcriptional progression in both sexes (<xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 7</xref>), altogether indicating that cell types outside of Vgat+Esr1+ clusters are less transcriptionally dynamic during this period.</p>
<p>Two major branches of transcriptional trajectories emerged from subpopulations of Vgat+Esr1+ cells in both sexes. In females, Branch1 was dominated by Vgat+ cluster 4, while Branch2 was occupied by clusters 2 and 16. In males, Branch1 was composed of Vgat+ clusters 4 and 16, while Branch 2 was primarily formed by Vgat+ cluster 2 (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 5g-j</xref>). The analysis of DEGs along these branches revealed distinct gene enrichment, indicating that specific subpopulations of Vgat+Esr1+ cells undergo unique transcriptional progressions during adolescence (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 5c-d</xref> and Supplementary Table 8). When we combined the trajectories for both sexes into a joint manifold, the model failed to capture hormone-dependent dynamics (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 6e-g</xref>), emphasizing that separate models are necessary for accurate analysis of sex-specific and sex-shared transcriptional progressions (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3k-n</xref>).</p>
<p>To strengthen our understanding of the developmental trajectory and transcriptional maturity of Vgat+Esr1+ clusters, we employed a support vector machine (SVM) classifier to predict the developmental state of single cells based solely on HA-DEGs <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>. The SVM accurately classified Vgat+Esr1+ single cells as either transcriptionally mature (intact adolescent or adult) or immature (preadolescent or hormonally deprived) with high accuracy (median prediction accuracy 90.6 – 93.6 %). In contrast, Vgat+ hormone R<sup>Low</sup> cells had significantly lower prediction accuracy (median 66.7 - 73.0 %) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3h,j</xref>), further underscoring the importance of Vgat+Esr1+ clusters in the development of MPOA transcriptional states.</p>
<p>Finally, we validated our pseudotime trajectories (Monocle V3) using Manifold Enhancement Latent Dimension (MELD) analysis, which measures continuous transcriptional progression in response to experimental conditions (P23, P35, P50, GDX) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>. MELD analysis corroborated our findings from pseudotime, showing that intact adolescents and adults were spatially segregated in transcriptional space and exhibited a higher likelihood of reaching mature transcriptional states compared to preadolescent and hormonally deprived groups (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 6h-m</xref>). These results, visualized in PHATE (Potential of Heat-diffusion for Affinity-based Trajectory Embedding) space <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>, further highlight that while MPOA neuronal cell types are terminally diversified by preadolescence (P23) (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figs. 2h</xref>, <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">3e</xref>), Vgat+Esr1+ neurons continue to undergo hormonally dependent transcriptional refinement from adolescence into adulthood.</p>

<title>Spatial phenotyping of MPOA cell types during adolescence</title>
<p>To assess whether adolescent hormonal changes affect spatially resolved gene expression in the MPOA and to cross-validate our scRNAseq trajectory analyses, we performed highly multiplexed hybridization chain reaction fluorescent <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization (HM-HCR FISH, V3)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>.

<p>To distinguish Vgat+Esr1+ from Vgat+ hormone R<sup>Low</sup> cells, we measured <italic>Slc32a1</italic>, <italic>Esr1, Ar,</italic> and 8-9 DEGs during adolescence (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4d-e</xref> and <xref rid="figs8" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figs. 8</xref>-<xref rid="figs9" ref-type="fig">9</xref>. Details in Methods). Consistent with the scRNAseq data, we observed a transcriptional progression from the preadolescent state (P23) to a matured state (P35 and P50), where the dynamics were bidirectionally influenced by circulating steroids– accelerated by early testosterone or estrogen supplementation (P28 T or E2) and delayed in a hormonally-deprived state (GDX) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4f-g</xref> and <xref rid="figs9" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 9a-c,f,i-q</xref>). Interestingly, the transcriptional trajectories of female and male adolescents differed spatially, but both were regulated by sex hormones (<xref rid="figs9" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 9r-u</xref>). This suggests that neurons defined transcriptionally as adult female or male occupy partially overlapping spatial distributions in the MPOA. SVM classification revealed that the expression of ≥10 genes in Vgat+Esr1+ cells from the HM-HCR FISH data was sufficient to accurately classify individual cells as transcriptionally mature or immature, with high accuracy (84.4– 85.5 %). However, the same set of genes significantly underperformed in classifying Vgat+ hormone R<sup>Low</sup> cells (63.6–64.6 %) (<xref rid="figs9" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 9d,g</xref>). Classification accuracy further decreased when individual genes were iteratively removed (<xref rid="figs9" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 9e,h</xref>), further indicating that a relatively small combinatorial set of HA-DEGs is sufficient for accurately identifying age- and sex-specific transcriptional states.</p>
<p>Molecular profiling of the MPOA in adult mice has established the presence of sexual dimorphism <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>. Our scRNAseq and <italic>in situ</italic> analyses further show hormone-dependent transcriptional progression during adolescence in both females and males. However, critical questions remain about whether (1) sexual dimorphism is evident within specific MPOA cell types, (2) sexually dimorphic genes overlap with adolescent gene sets, and (3) the degree of sexual dimorphism shifts during adolescence. To address these questions, we first identified sexually dimorphic genes across Vgat+ clusters (<xref rid="figs10" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 10a</xref> and <xref rid="figs11" ref-type="fig">11</xref>). Like HA-DEGs, sexually dimorphic genes were enriched within Vgat+Esr1+ clusters. The number of these dimorphic genes correlated with <italic>Esr1</italic> expression, where sexually dimorphic genes co-expressed most often with <italic>Esr1</italic> in both sexes (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5a-e</xref> and <xref rid="figs10" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 10a</xref> and Supplementary Table 6).

<p>Previous research has shown that <italic>Esr1</italic> plays a role in regulating sexual dimorphisms within sexually dimorphic brain nuclei <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. However, androgen receptor (AR) activation may also be essential for the expression of sexually dimorphic genes. To determine whether AR regulates male dimorphic genes, we performed single-cell regulatory network inference (SCENIC) analysis <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>. SCENIC identified a regulon of 33 AR-regulated genes, which were highly co-expressed with <italic>Ar</italic> and enriched with <italic>Ar</italic>’s consensus DNA regulatory element within their gene loci, in the male dimorphic gene set (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5h</xref>). AUCell analysis, however, showed that male dimorphic AR-regulon genes were enriched within male Vgat+Esr1+ clusters but not in Vgat+ Esr1-Ar+ clusters (specifically Vgat+ 5, 8, and 13) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5i</xref>). Consistent with this observation, regression analysis showed that <italic>Esr1</italic> expression, rather than <italic>Ar</italic>, predicted the expression of male dimorphic AR-regulon genes (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5j</xref>).</p>
<p>As previously noted, a subset of sexually dimorphic genes overlaps with adolescent-related genes (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5f</xref>). The number of sexually dimorphic genes increases during adolescence but reverts following gonadectomy (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6a-b</xref>). Among 45 female dimorphic genes, 12 showed increased expression during adolescence (adolescence-related dimorphic genes), while 7 were not associated with adolescence (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6a, right</xref>). Of the 110 dimorphic genes in males, 52 were adolescence-related dimorphic genes and 10 were not (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6b, right</xref>). The expression levels of adolescence-related dimorphic genes were the highest at P50 and were again reduced by gonadectomy in both sexes (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6a-b</xref>). SVM analysis revealed that adolescence-related dimorphic genes decoded sex with the highest accuracy in intact P50 males and females, followed by P35, and were less accurate in P23 and GDX groups. In contrast, adolescence-unrelated dimorphic genes successfully predict the sexes of single cells with high accuracy (&gt;90%) irrespective of age and conditions (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6c-d</xref>), emphasizing the influence of adolescence-related dimorphic genes in shaping MPOA sex-specific transcriptional profiles. AUCell and trajectory analyses were then performed to quantify the transcriptional dynamics of sexual dimorphic genes during adolescence. These analyses consistently demonstrated that transcriptional states were the most sexually dimorphic at P50 driven by adolescence-related dimorphic genes and were the least dimorphic at P23 and GDX (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6e-h</xref>). Thus, combined trajectory analysis of all Vgat+Esr1+ neurons from both sexes, along with AUCell analysis, revealed that P50F and P50M cells were the most sexually dimorphic from each other. However, these transcriptional states were bridged via a common immature state observed largely prior to adolescence onset or in hormonally depleted conditions, suggesting that sexually dimorphic MPOA gene expression is bimodal in adults but largely continuous between males and females prior to adolescence. These analyses (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figs. 5</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>) indicate that: 1) sexual dimorphism is most pronounced in Vgat+Esr1+ cells; 2) a subset of sexually dimorphic genes are linked to adolescence, with a fraction of adolescence-related genes shared between sexes; and 3) sexual dimorphism in the MPOA expands during adolescence as sex steroid hormone levels rise.</p>

<title><italic>Esr1</italic> knockout at preadolescence alters the transcriptional dynamics of Vgat+ MPOA neurons</title>
<p>Co-expression of <italic>Esr1</italic> with adolescence genes and dimorphic genes, along with partially distinct transcriptional dynamics in Vgat+Esr1+ cells between adolescent females and males, suggests that <italic>Esr1</italic> uniquely regulates gene expression in each sex.

Esr1KO in Vgat+ MPOA neurons reduced the DEGs in males and females (Esr1-DEGs) to 600 and 824, respectively, while only reducing 5.3% and 3.3% of male and female Esr1-DEGs in Vgat+ hormone R<sup>Low</sup> cells (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7b</xref> and <xref rid="figs10" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 10c</xref> and Supplementary Table 9). Previously identified HA-DEGs (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>) were largely represented in this list of Esr1-DEGs, suggesting that <italic>Esr1</italic> deletion recapitulates hormone deprivation effects on the transcriptomes of Vgat+Esr1+ cells (males: 56.5%, 78/138 genes; females: 73.3%, 124/169 genes; <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7b</xref>). Again, because of the complex nature of this relationship between dimorphic and adolescent genes, we generated a separate manifold for each sex to assess MPOA adolescent transcriptional dynamics. Pseudotime trajectory analysis indicated that Esr1KO near-completely prevented adolescent transcriptional maturation in both sexes (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7c-h</xref> and <xref rid="figs12" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 12</xref>). DE analysis also identified sex-shared and -specific processes (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7i-l</xref> and Supplementary Table 10). In addition, dimorphic genes in the Esr1-DEGs of Vgat+Esr1+ cells were sufficient to predict the sex in P50 females and males with the highest accuracy (81.4 ± 0.11 %), followed by P35, and lowest accuracy in P23 (<xref rid="figs10" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 10d</xref>). Like our previous observation (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 6</xref>), we observed two major branches of transcriptional trajectories with branch specific gene expression profiles, primarily originating from one to two subpopulations of Vgat+Esr1+ clusters (<xref rid="figs12" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 12c-d</xref> and Supplementary Table 10) highlighting <italic>Esr1</italic> as a key regulator of adolescent transcriptional dynamics in the MPOA of both sexes.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Adolescence represents a critical period for the maturation of behaviors and brain functions necessary for reproduction and social interactions. Unlike homeostatic processes such as eating and breathing, many behaviors that define adulthood emerge through hormonally driven neural circuit refinements during adolescence <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>. Our study provides a detailed analysis of transcriptional dynamics in MPOA Esr1+ neurons, revealing their essential role in the adolescent maturation of mating behaviors in both sexes. Using a combination of single-cell RNA sequencing, advanced <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization techniques, and functional genomic manipulations, we show that Esr1 is a central regulator of these adolescent transcriptional changes. We show that MPOA Esr1+ neurons are transcriptionally dynamic during adolescence, progressing from an immature state in preadolescence to mature adult-like states in a hormone-dependent manner. This maturation process was arrested in mice lacking <italic>Esr1</italic> in MPOA Vgat+ neurons during adolescence, leading to profound deficits in mating behaviors. Importantly, these findings highlight that transcriptional programs driving sexual maturation are cell-type specific and temporally constrained, dependent on precise hormonal signaling during adolescence. Adolescent transcriptional dynamics in MPOA Esr1+ neurons appear to be continuous, with trajectories shaped by circulating sex hormones. This hormone-dependent maturation was confirmed by pseudotime analysis, which revealed that hormonal deprivation arrests transcriptional progression, while hormone supplementation accelerates it. These findings align with the broader view that the adolescent brain undergoes extensive molecular and circuit-level adaptations to support the emergence of sexually dimorphic behaviors <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>.</p>

<title>Integration of MPOA sexual dimorphism and adolescence-related transcriptional dynamics</title>
<p>One of the major contributions of this study is the disentanglement of sexual dimorphism and adolescent dynamics in Esr1+ neurons. We identified subsets of genes that are both sexually dimorphic and adolescently dynamic, as well as genes that are unique to each process. This complex interplay underscores the importance of analyzing these processes separately in a sex-specific fashion to uncover their contributions to neural development. Our findings suggest that Esr1 not only regulates common gene programs shared by males and females but can also orchestrate sexually distinct transcriptional networks. The male-specific enrichment of androgen receptor-related genes and the identification of sexually dimorphic Esr1-dependent transcription factors (e.g., <italic>Pou6f2</italic> in males, <italic>Creb3l1</italic> in females) further highlight how Esr1 integrates hormonal signals to shape sex-specific neural circuits <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>.</p>

<title>Functional implications for neural circuitry and behavior</title>
<p>The adolescent transcriptional changes observed in MPOA Esr1+ neurons likely translate to functional adaptations in mating-relevant neural circuits. Previous studies have shown that MPOA neurons are critical for a wide range of sexually dimorphic behaviors, including mounting, vocalization, and parental care <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>. Our study provides molecular evidence linking the transcriptional maturation of MPOA Esr1+ neurons to these behaviors. This link is especially compelling considering our integration with published MERFISH datasets, which further validated the association of Vgat+Esr1+ neurons with mating behaviors in both sexes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. Dynamic changes in the circuit properties of MPOA neurons during adolescence may involve alterations in cellular excitability, synaptic connectivity, and interactions with downstream targets. Ontology analysis of Esr1-dependent genes revealed enrichment for pathways related to synaptic transmission and axonal structure, supporting the hypothesis that transcriptional maturation directly contributes to circuit remodeling <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup>. Future studies combining transcriptional profiling and CRISPR gene editing with <italic>in vivo</italic> imaging and circuit manipulation will be essential to dissect these connections. Our study complements previous work on perinatal transcriptional dynamics in sexually dimorphic brain regions, such as the BNST <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. While the perinatal period is critical for establishing primary sexual differentiation, our findings emphasize adolescence as a secondary critical period where sexually dimorphic transcriptional programs are refined. Notably, both periods rely heavily on Esr1-mediated regulation, suggesting a conserved role for estrogen signaling across developmental stages.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2c">
<title>Limitations of the study</title>
<p>While these results suggest that male and female adolescent transcriptional maturation has unique and overlapping components, some technical limitations of the results are worth noting. First, UMIs per cell are low due to older scRNAseq technology being used. We used HM-HCR FISH to corroborate our findings because this technique is very sensitive for detecting targeted genes. However, it is likely that the transcriptional state changes we observed are blunted due to sparse gene expression detection in 10X V2 kits compared to now-standard versions of these reagents. Additionally, while KO of Esr1 has dramatic impacts on mating behavior in both sexes, due to the massive number of genes that are regulated by Esr1, this is not surprising. Now that we have a list of targeted genes that are likely directly under the influence of Esr1, future studies are needed to resolve how individual or groups of Esr1-associated DEGs are critical for specific aspects of mating behavior.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2d">
<title>Conclusions and future directions</title>
<p>These findings have implications beyond mating behaviors. The role of Esr1+ neurons in the MPOA likely extends to other hormonally sensitive behaviors and physiological processes, such as thermoregulation, metabolic control, and social bonding <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup>. Additionally, understanding how disruptions in these transcriptional programs contribute to developmental disorders—such as delayed puberty, hypogonadism, or neuropsychiatric conditions with sex-biased prevalence—represents an important avenue for future research <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. While our study focused on Esr1, it is likely that other transcription factors and hormone receptors synergistically contribute to adolescent transcriptional dynamics. For example, the androgen receptor may play a role in males, while additional regulatory networks may be governed by sex chromosome-linked genes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>. Advanced genomic approaches, such as perturb-seq, could help unravel the complexity of these gene regulatory networks in a cell-type-specific manner <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>. Although we focused on adolescent transcriptional trajectories of Vgat+Esr1+ neurons, this dataset provides a rich resource for studying transcriptional states across other neuronal, glial, and stromal MPOA cell types during adolescent brain development. Understanding steroid-induced changes in transcriptional trajectories during two major developmental periods (perinatal and adolescence periods) has implications for the healthy and maladaptive development of human brains, and provides additional insight into neurobiological mechanisms that underlie sex differences <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup>.</p>

<title>Mice</title>
<p>Several lines of male and female mice were used for scRNAseq, HM-HCR FISH, immunohistochemistry (IHC), and behavioral experiments, with specific ages and experimental conditions described in their respective sections. All mice used in these experiments were on a C57BL/6 background. Wild-type C57BL/6J mice were originally obtained from Jackson Laboratory (JAX) and bred in-house. Transgenic <italic>Slc32a1</italic><sup>Flp</sup>::<italic>Esr1</italic><sup>lox/lox</sup> mice were generated by crossing <italic>Slc32a1</italic><sup>Flp</sup> mice (Jackson Laboratory stock no. 029591) with <italic>Esr1</italic><sup>lox/lox</sup> mice (kindly provided by Kenneth Korach; Jackson Laboratory stock no. 032173), and then breeding the resulting progeny with <italic>Slc32a1</italic><sup>Flp</sup>::<italic>Esr1</italic><sup>lox/+</sup> mice. Similarly, <italic>Slc17a6</italic><sup>Flp</sup>::<italic>Esr1</italic><sup>lox/lox</sup> mice were generated by crossing <italic>Slc17a6</italic><sup>Flp</sup> mice (Jackson Laboratory stock no. 030212) with <italic>Esr1</italic><sup>lox/lox</sup> mice and then crossing the progeny with <italic>Slc17a6</italic><sup>Flp</sup>::<italic>Esr1</italic><sup>lox/+</sup> mice. For both lines, only mice heterozygous for Flp and homozygous for Esr1<sup>lox/lox</sup> were used in experiments. For scRNAseq and HCR experiments, mice were group-housed except for the 1–2 days prior to tissue isolation, during which they were singly housed. Behavioral experiment mice were singly housed for the duration of the experiments. Wild-type Swiss Webster (SW) mice, originally obtained from Taconic and bred in-house, were used as lactating foster dams to rear pups following brain surgery, as C57BL/6 dams frequently committed infanticide after such procedures. All mice were maintained with <italic>ad libitum</italic> access to food and water under a reverse 12-hour light-dark cycle. All experiments were conducted in accordance with the National Institutes of Health’s <italic>Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals</italic> and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees (IACUC) of the University of North Carolina and University of Washington.</p>

<title>Stereotaxic viral injection</title>
<p>Juvenile mice aged P14–18 were separated from their dams, anesthetized with isoflurane, and positioned in a stereotaxic frame (Kopf Instruments). Isoflurane anesthesia was maintained at less than 0.8% throughout the procedure. Following a craniotomy above the target region, viral injections were performed using glass capillaries at a controlled rate of 60 nl/min with a Nanoject system (Drummond). To ensure accurate delivery and minimize backflow, injections were paused for 30 seconds after every 60 nl infusion, and the capillaries were left in place for 10 minutes before withdrawal. The stereotaxic coordinates used were 0.2 mm AP and 0.23 mm ML from Bregma; -4.95 mm DV from the brain surface. After recovery from anesthesia, mice were transferred to the care of lactating Swiss Webster (SW) foster dams. SW dams effectively nursed surgically treated pups, whereas C57BL/6 dams frequently committed infanticide following such procedures.</p>

<sec id="s7c">
<title>Gonadectomy</title>
<p>Gonadectomized mice were prepared for scRNAseq and HCR experiments. At P22–23, mice were anesthetized with isoflurane and maintained under anesthesia at less than 1.0%. After shaving the hair around the flank area for females or the scrotum for males, local anesthesia was administered, and a small incision was made through the skin and muscle above the target gonads. The gonads were identified, gently exteriorized with forceps, and removed using a heat cautery pen (Bovie Medical). The remaining tissues were returned to the abdominal cavity (females) or scrotum (males). The incision site was closed with sutures, and tissue adhesive (Vetbond) was applied to ensure secure skin closure. Brain tissues were collected at P50 ± 2, ensuring the mice were deprived of sex hormones throughout adolescence. Gonadectomized adult female mice were also prepared as stimulus animals for Resident Intruder (RI) and three-chamber sociability assays. For these experiments, 7–8-week-old C57BL/6J female mice were ovariectomized using the same procedure. After a three-week recovery period, a standard hormonal priming protocol was used to induce estrus. This involved subcutaneous injections of β-Estradiol 3-Benzoate (Sigma, 10 µg at 48 hours and 5 µg at 24 hours before the assay) and Progesterone (Sigma, 500 µg) administered six hours prior to the RI assay.</p>

<title>Generation of AAV-frtFlex-Cre virus</title>
<p>The split-Cre design used in this study was previously described <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup>. In this system, an intron is introduced into the middle of the Cre sequence, with the second exon flanked by frt sites. The action of FLP recombinase inverts the second exon, enabling splicing to generate functional Cre. For these experiments, the construct was incorporated into an AAV vector. The frtFlex-Cre-EGFP cassette was subcloned into the pAAV-CAG-WPRE vector between AscI and XhoI restriction sites. AAV1 virus carrying frtFlex-Cre-EGFP was produced as described previously <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup>. Briefly, pAAV-CAG-frtFlex-Cre-EGFP-WPRE was transiently transfected into HEK293T/17 cells (ATCC) along with the pDG1 packaging plasmid. Twenty-four hours post-transfection, cells were transferred to serum-free media, and viral capsids were harvested 48 hours later. Purification of AAV1 capsids was performed using gradient centrifugation. Viral titer was estimated at approximately 2 × 10<sup>12</sup> particles/mL based on densitometry analysis following gel electrophoresis, using a known standard for reference.</p>

<title>Single-cell preparation and cDNA library construction for scRNAseq</title>
<p>Male and female wild-type mice (n = 3–4 animals pooled per group) were prepared at P23 ± 1 (preadolescence, hormonally intact), P35 ± 1 (mid-adolescence, hormonally intact), and P50 ± 2 (hormonally intact early adulthood or gonadectomy groups). For gonadectomy groups, mice were gonadectomized at P22–23. Additionally, male and female <italic>Slc32a1</italic><sup>Flp</sup>::<italic>Esr1</italic><sup>lox/lox</sup> mice (n = 3–4 per group), which had received bilateral MPOA injections of 300 nl AAV-frtFlex-Cre at P14–18, were collected at P50 ± 2 (early adulthood). All mice were singly housed 1–2 days before tissue dissection.</p>
<p>Single-cell preparation followed previously published procedures <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></sup>. Immediately after removal from their home cages, mice were deeply anesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection of 0.2 mL sodium pentobarbital (39 mg/mL) and phenytoin sodium (5 mg/mL), followed by transcardial perfusion with ice-cold NMDG-aCSF containing transcription and translation inhibitors to minimize transcriptional events induced by anesthesia, perfusion, or brain extraction. NMDG-aCSF consisted of 96 mM NMDG, 2.5 mM KCl, 1.35 mM NaH2PO4, 30 mM NaHCO3, 20 mM HEPES, 25 mM glucose, 2 mM thiourea, 5 mM Na+ ascorbate, 3 mM Na+ pyruvate, 0.6 mM glutathione-ethyl-ester, 2 mM N-acetyl-cysteine, 0.5 mM CaCl2, and 10 mM MgSO4 (pH 7.35–7.40, 300–305 mOsm, oxygenated with 95% O2 and 5% CO2). Inhibitor cocktails included 500 nM TTX, 10 μM APV, 10 μM DNQX, 5 μM actinomycin, and 37.7 μM anisomycin. Brains were extracted, and coronal sections containing the MPOA were sliced at 300 µm using a vibratome (Leica VT1200). Slices (3–4 per animal) were recovered on ice in a chamber for 30 minutes. MPOA tissues were dissected under a light microscope (Leica MZFL) using a micro scalpel (Feather) from 3–4 animals per group (10–15 slices pooled per group). The tissue was enzymatically digested with 1 mg/mL pronase (Sigma-Aldrich) for 30 minutes at room temperature, followed by mechanical trituration using fire-polished glass capillaries (tip diameter 200–300 µm). Cell suspensions were filtered twice through 40 µm strainers to remove aggregates, and dead cells were eliminated using a dead cell removal kit (Miltenyi Biotec). After centrifugation, the supernatant was removed, and cells were resuspended (20– 30 mL). A fraction (∼5 mL) was mixed with trypan blue for viability assessment and cell concentration measurement using a hemocytometer. Samples with &gt;80% viability were used for cDNA library preparation, and final cell concentrations were adjusted to 800–1,000 cells/µL. Typically, 30,000–80,000 cells were collected from 3–4 mice per group, exceeding the number required for cDNA library construction and reducing biological variability between subjects.</p>
<p>cDNA libraries were prepared using the Chromium Single Cell 3’ Reagent Kits V2 according to the manufacturer’s instructions (10x Genomics). Approximately 17,000 dissociated cells were mixed with reverse transcription mix and loaded onto a chip to recover up to 10,000 single cells. mRNAs from single cells were captured by barcoded beads in droplets using a Chromium Controller. Reverse-transcribed cDNAs were PCR amplified, fragmented, and ligated with adapters, followed by sample indexing via PCR. cDNA libraries were sequenced on an Illumina NextSeq 500 (v2.5) or HiSeq system. Sequencing reads were aligned to the mouse genome using the 10x Genomics Cell Ranger pipeline (V3) to generate cell-by-gene count matrices for downstream analysis.</p>

<title>Highly Multiplexed HCR FISH</title>
<p>HM-HCR FISH assays were conducted to validate trajectory inference from scRNAseq data (HCR1; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> and <xref rid="figs8" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 8</xref>–9) and to cross-validate the Esr1-GRN analysis (HCR2; <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>).</p>
<p>For HCR1, we analyzed groups included in the scRNAseq experiments, including preadolescence (P23 ± 1), adolescence (P35 ± 1), intact adult (P50 ± 2), and gonadectomy groups (P50 ± 2, gonadectomy performed at P22–23). Additionally, a hormone-supplemented group received daily injections of sex hormones (females: 5 µg β-Estradiol 3-Benzoate in 50 µl sesame oil; males: 200 µg Testosterone Propionate in 50 µl sesame oil) from P22 to P27, with tissue collected at P28. A control group for hormone supplementation received daily injections of sesame oil (50 µl) during the same period, and brains were harvested at P28. The timing of hormone supplementation aligned with the onset of adolescence in peripheral tissues (P28–33; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c, f</xref>) and reports from the pituitary (P25–30; <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref></sup>). Adolescence onset was verified in hormone-supplemented animals by assessing male balanopreputial separation (BPS) and female vaginal opening (VO). All hormone-supplemented animals displayed BPS or VO by P28, whereas none of the controls reached adolescence by this age. All mice in the 12 groups were singly housed 1–2 days prior to tissue collection.</p>
<p>For HCR2, AAV-Cre-YFP or AAV-Flp-YFP was injected into the MPOA of Esr1<sup>lox/lox</sup> mice of both sexes at P30–35, and brain tissues were harvested three weeks later. For both HCR1 and HCR2, mice (n = 2 per group) were deeply anesthetized with isoflurane, and brains were rapidly extracted and frozen on dry ice. Coronal sections (20 µm) were prepared using a cryostat (Leica) and stored at -80°C until use.</p>
    <p>Sequential HCR FISH followed a modified protocol based on <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>. Tissue sections were fixed in pre-chilled 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 30 minutes on ice, rinsed twice in 1x PBS at room temperature, dehydrated in ethanol (50%, 70%, 100%, 100%; 5 minutes each), and air-dried for 5 minutes. Sections were then permeabilized with protease IV (ACD, 322336) for 5 minutes at room temperature, followed by rinses in 1x PBS and 2x SSC. Probes, amplifiers, and buffers (Molecular Instruments) were prepared as per the manufacturer’s guidelines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Choi et al., 2018</xref>). Tissue was equilibrated in probe hybridization buffer for 10 minutes at 37°C in a humidified chamber, then incubated overnight with probe mixtures (final concentration 4–10 nM) at 37°C. Coverslips were removed in 100% pre-warmed wash buffer at 37°C, and tissues were sequentially washed in dilutions of wash buffer in 5x SSCT (75%, 50%, 25%; 15 minutes each), then in 5x SSCT at 37°C (15 minutes) and at room temperature (5 minutes).</p>
<p>For signal amplification, tissues were equilibrated in amplification buffer for 30 minutes at room temperature, then incubated overnight with snap-cooled hairpins conjugated to Alexa488, 546/594, and 647 (final concentration 60 nM). Coverslips were removed in 5x SSCT at room temperature, followed by two 30-minute washes in fresh 5x SSCT and rinses in 2x SSC. Autofluorescence was minimized with a quenching kit (Vector Laboratories, SP-8400-15). Sections were treated with quenching solution for 2 minutes, rinsed in 2x SSC, counterstained with DAPI (ACD, 320858) for 30 seconds, mounted in Vectashield (Vector Laboratories, H-1700-10), and stored at 4°C. DAPI staining was performed only in the first round, and all images were acquired within 24 hours.</p>
<p>Probes and amplifiers were stripped between rounds to enable multiplexing. Coverslips were floated off in 2x SSC for 30 minutes at room temperature, and tissue was incubated in DNase I (250 U/mL in 1x DNase I buffer, Roche, 04716728001) for 1.5 hours at room temperature, followed by six washes in 2x SSC (5 minutes each). Tissue was then equilibrated in pre-hybridization buffer for subsequent rounds. This process was repeated for up to four rounds, allowing detection of up to 12 different mRNAs.</p>
<p>Images were acquired using an Axio Imager M2 fluorescence microscope (Zeiss) equipped with Zen software. Channels for green (Alexa488), red (Alexa546/594), and far-red (Alexa647) fluorescence were captured, along with brightfield images to aid registration. DAPI signals from the first round defined nuclear regions of interest (ROIs), which were expanded to include cytoplasmic transcripts. Image registration was performed using HiPlex software (ACD), with brightfield images from subsequent rounds aligned to the first round using transformation matrices. Up to 17 images were overlaid, and overlapping regions were cropped to generate a single 12-plex image.</p>
<p>For quantification, HCR FISH images were analyzed in ImageJ. DAPI-defined ROIs were transferred to the 12-plex image to measure transcript numbers for each gene. For HCR1, genes enriched in Vgat+Esr1+ neurons and HA-DEGs from scRNAseq data were analyzed, with validation by SVM (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 6k, m</xref>). For HCR2, Esr1-TFs and Esr1-DEGs regulated by Esr1-TFs or Esr1 were selected from the Esr1-GRN (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>).</p>

<title>Behavioral experiments</title>
<p>Male and female <italic>Slc32a1</italic><sup>Flp</sup><italic>::Esr1</italic><sup>lox/lox</sup> or <italic>Slc17a6</italic><sup>Flp</sup><italic>::Esr1</italic><sup>lox/lox</sup> mice were bilaterally injected with 300 nl of AAV-frtFlex-Cre (Cre group; virus generated in-house, detailed in the Generation of AAV-frtFlex-Cre virus section) or AAV-fDIO-eYFP (control group; UNC Vector Core) at P14–18. Starting at P25, sexual organ development was inspected daily to determine the age of first balano-preputial separation (BPS) in males or vaginal opening (VO) in females. For female subjects, vaginal smears were also collected daily following vaginal opening to monitor estrous cycles. Behavioral experiments, including the Resident Intruder (RI) assay, locomotion tests, sociability assays, and the Elevated Plus Maze (EPM), were conducted during the second half of the dark cycle under red-light illumination. Body weights were recorded daily from P30 to P54. Upon completion of the behavioral experiments, subjects were deeply anesthetized, and brain tissues were collected for histological analysis (detailed in the Histology section). Mice that failed to gain weight or received mistargeted viral injections were excluded from the analysis.</p>
<p>To assess the adolescent maturation of sexual behaviors, male subjects underwent RI assays from P34 to P54 every other day. In this assay, a hormonally primed adult female mouse was introduced into the male subject’s home cage for a 15-minute interaction (Cre groups: <italic>Slc32a1</italic><sup>Flp</sup><italic>::Esr1</italic><sup>lox/lox</sup>, n = 12; <italic>Slc17a6</italic><sup>Flp</sup><italic>::Esr1</italic><sup>lox/lox</sup>, n = 9; control groups: <italic>Slc32a1</italic><sup>Flp</sup><italic>::Esr1</italic><sup>lox/lox</sup>, n = 13; <italic>Slc17a6</italic><sup>Flp</sup><italic>::Esr1</italic><sup>lox/lox</sup>, n = 9). To prevent ejaculation, male subjects were separated from the female intruder as soon as thrusting began. The interactions were video-recorded, and the number of mounting and thrusting behaviors was manually counted.</p>
<p>Female sexual receptivity was assessed in RI assays conducted from P35 to P54 for <italic>Slc32a1</italic><sup>Flp</sup><italic>::Esr1</italic><sup>lox/lox</sup> mice (Cre group: n = 16; control group: n = 10) and from P40 to P60 for <italic>Slc17a6</italic><sup>Flp</sup><italic>::Esr1</italic><sup>lox/lox</sup> mice (Cre group: n = 9; control group: n = 11). Assay timing was guided by pilot experiments and conducted only when vaginal smears indicated the female was in proestrus or estrus. Female subjects were introduced into the home cage of a sexually experienced adult male mouse and allowed to interact freely for 10 minutes. To avoid ejaculation, females were separated from the male after intromission began or approximately 5 seconds after an unsuccessful mounting attempt. These interactions were recorded using an IR camera controlled by Ethovision (Noldus), and behaviors such as being mounted, intromitted, escaping, or displaying submissive postures were manually counted. Receptivity was calculated as the proportion of intromission bouts out of total mounting attempts. Stress levels were minimized and equalized across groups by selecting highly sexually experienced but minimally aggressive male residents. In rare instances of aggression, male residents were promptly removed. Unlike mice with brain-wide <italic>Esr1</italic> deletions <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>, the male subjects in this study, with <italic>Esr1</italic> knockouts limited to MPOA Vgat+ neurons during adolescence, showed no aggressive behaviors, consistent with previous findings <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Sociability tests were conducted after P45 on days when RI assays were not performed. Subjects were placed in a standard three-chamber choice arena, where one side contained a caged social stimulus and the other an object. Stimulus mice were either adult males or hormonally primed females. After a 5-minute habituation period without stimuli, a social stimulus and an object were introduced, and the subject mouse was allowed to explore for 10 minutes. The stimuli were then exchanged for a new mouse of the opposite sex and a novel object, and the subject mouse explored for an additional 10 minutes. Movements and locations were tracked using an IR camera controlled by Ethovision (Noldus). Total distance traveled during the habituation period was used to assess locomotion, while the time spent in the chamber with the social stimulus was used for statistical comparisons.</p>
<p>The Elevated Plus Maze (EPM) test was performed after P45 on days when neither RI assays nor sociability tests were conducted. Subjects were placed in a standard EPM arena and allowed to explore freely. After a 5-minute habituation period, movements were tracked using an IR camera controlled by Ethovision (Noldus). Time spent in open and closed arms of the maze was recorded for statistical analysis.</p>

<p>Histological experiments were conducted to: (1) examine viral infection in the MPOA of mice used in behavioral experiments (<italic>Slc32a1</italic><sup>Flp</sup><italic>::Esr1</italic><sup>lox/lox</sup> or <italic>Slc17a6</italic><sup>Flp</sup><italic>::Esr1</italic><sup>lox/lox</sup>), (2) validate the specificity of AAV-frtFlex-Cre in <italic>Esr1</italic><sup>lox/lox</sup> mice, and (3) confirm the specificity of reporter gene expression in <italic>Slc32a1</italic><sup>Flp</sup><italic>::Esr1-Cre::RC-FLTG</italic> mice. Mice were deeply anesthetized with pentobarbital and transcardially perfused with 40 mL of 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS. Brains were extracted and post-fixed in 4% PFA in PBS on ice for 5–7 hours before being transferred to PBS with 0.05% sodium azide (Sigma) for storage at 4°C until sectioning. Free-floating coronal brain sections (50 µm thick) were prepared using a vibratome (Leica) and stored in PBS with 0.05% sodium azide until immunohistochemistry (IHC). Sections were first washed in PBS (3 × 5 minutes) and blocked with 15% normal donkey serum (NDS) in PBST (0.3% Triton X-100) for 2 hours at room temperature. Following blocking, sections were incubated with an anti-Esr1 primary antibody (1:500, Santa Cruz, sc-542) diluted in 15% NDS in PBST for 72 hours at 4°C. After incubation, sections were washed in PBST (0.3% Triton X-100, 3 × 30 minutes) and incubated with a secondary antibody (1:500, Life Technologies donkey anti-rabbit 568 or Jackson ImmunoResearch donkey anti-rabbit 647) diluted in 15% NDS in PBST for 2 hours at room temperature. Sections were then washed in PBST (2 × 15 minutes), incubated with DAPI for 2 minutes, rinsed in PBS (2 × 15 minutes), mounted on slides, and coverslipped with mounting medium. Tiled images of the MPOA were acquired using a Zeiss ApoTome2 fluorescence microscope with a 20x objective and Zen software (Zeiss). Image acquisition settings were consistent across all experiments. The resulting CZI files were analyzed with HALO software using the ISH-IF version 1.2 module (Indica Labs). Regions of interest (ROIs) corresponding to the MPOA were manually outlined in both hemispheres across three adjacent sections from each brain. GFP- or YFP-positive cells, Esr1-positive cells, and double-positive cells were automatically detected and quantified using specific threshold settings to define phenotypes.</p>

<title>Data analysis for scRNAseq, MERFISH, and HM-HCR data</title>
<p>Analysis of scRNAseq, MERFISH, and HM-HCR FISH data utilized several R and Python packages, which were adapted and modified as needed. Previously published MERFISH data, deposited in DRYAD, was acquired from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.8t8s248">https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.8t8s248</ext-link>. The data analysis workflow encompassed clustering, differential gene expression analysis, integration of differential conditions and modalities, lineage inference, gene set activity measurements, and gene regulatory network (GRN) deconstruction.</p>
    <p>Clustering and differential gene expression analyses were performed using the Seurat V3 package <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>, while LISI <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref></sup> was applied to evaluate integration performance across conditions. Lineage inference, representing transcriptional connectivity of neuronal clusters, was conducted with PAGA (partition-based graph abstraction; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Wolf et al., 2019</xref>). Single-cell gene set activity was quantified using AUCell <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>. GRNs were inferred and deconstructed using the SCENIC package, which integrates GENIE3 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref></sup> and RcisTarget. These analyses depicted cis-regulatory relationships between transcription factors and differentially expressed genes. Gene co-expression networks were identified using scWGCNA <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref></sup>. To examine transcriptional state progressions by age and hormonal state, Monocle V3 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup> and MELD <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup> were applied.

<title>Integrative clustering and differential gene expression analysis</title>
<p>To minimize the effects of batch variability and differences due to sex, age, and hormonal state while preserving the global similarity of transcriptional states within cell types, we applied the Seurat V3 integrative approach <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>. This method combines canonical correlation analysis (CCA; <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref></sup>) and mutual nearest neighbor analysis <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref></sup>. After preprocessing the data, which included 58,921 cells in total, gene counts were normalized using the NormalizeData function to scale counts by total UMI with a constant scale factor (10,000), followed by natural-log transformation (log1p). The FindVariableFeatures function was used to select 2,000 highly variable genes from each sample based on variance stabilizing transformation. Integration was performed pairwise using the FindIntegrationAnchors function (CCA1-40) to identify anchors and assign scores, followed by the IntegrateData function to compute an integrated gene expression matrix by iteratively constructing and subtracting transformation matrices from the original data.</p>
<p>The integrated expression data was used for clustering. Expression matrices were scaled, centered, and reduced using principal component analysis (PCA). A nearest-neighbor graph was constructed in PCA space (FindNeighbors; default settings), followed by Louvain clustering at a resolution of 0.8 (FindClusters). Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) was then generated for visualization (RunUMAP). Initial clustering identified 32 clusters, 13 of which were neuronal, expressing canonical markers such as <italic>Thy1</italic> or <italic>Stmn2</italic>. Cell types were determined based on marker expression (Neuron: <italic>Stmn2, Thy1;</italic> Astrocyte: <italic>Ntsr2;</italic> OPC: <italic>Gpr17;</italic> Oligodendrocyte: <italic>Mog;</italic> Microglia: <italic>C1qc;</italic> Mural cell: <italic>Tagln;</italic> Endothelial cell: <italic>Flt1;</italic> Intermediate cell: <italic>B2m;</italic> Ependymal cell: <italic>Foxj1</italic>) as reported in previous studies <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref></sup>. Neuronal and non-neuronal cell types were combined for visualization (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 2a-d</xref>).</p>
<p>To identify conserved markers, we used the FindConservedMarkers function to compare gene expression in each cluster against the rest of the dataset using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test. P-values were adjusted for the number of genes tested, and genes with an adjusted p-value &lt; 0.05 were considered significantly enriched. Clustering robustness was assessed by sub-sampling 10–100% of cells and re-clustering using the same pipeline, repeated 10 times at each sampling rate.</p>
<p>For higher-resolution analysis, the 24,831 cells in the 13 neuronal clusters were extracted and re-clustered using the same integrative clustering approach. This resulted in 36 clusters, of which one (204 cells) was excluded due to low expression of neuronal markers. The remaining 24,627 cells in 35 neuronal clusters were analyzed using the FindConservedMarkers function to identify cluster-specific marker genes. These neuronal clusters included cells from all groups across different ages, sexes, and hormonal states.</p>
<p>Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between groups were calculated using the FindMarkers function. Pairwise comparisons were performed within aggregate Vgat+ or Vglut2+ clusters for each sex (criteria: &gt;10% expression, logFC &gt; 0, adjusted p-value &lt; 0.05). Hierarchical clustering of DEGs generated dendrogram trees, with a threshold (h = 3.15) used to identify DEG clusters. This analysis revealed DEG clusters with higher expression in P50 and P35 groups compared to P23 and gonadectomy (GDX) groups in both Vgat+ and Vglut2+ cells. Additional analyses identified hormonally associated DEGs (HA-DEGs) by comparing gene expression between P50 or P35 and GDX groups in individual or aggregate clusters (e.g., Vgat+Esr1+, Vgat+Esr1-Ar+, Vgat+ hormone RLow; where + indicates &gt;50% positive cells and - indicates &lt;10% positive cells).</p>
<p>To assess integration performance, Local Inverse Simpson’s Index (LISI; <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref></sup>) was computed in UMAP space, with LISI scores reflecting the effective number of distinct groups in the local neighborhood of each cell (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 2i</xref>). Clustering stability was further evaluated by examining lineage relationships between clusters at varying resolutions (0.2–2.0) using the clustree package <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref></sup>. Clustering tree analysis showed the emergence of heterogeneous <italic>Esr1</italic> clusters at resolution 0.8 or higher (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 2k</xref>). Specific marker genes in neuronal clusters (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 3a</xref>) and Vgat+Esr1+ subclusters (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 3h</xref>) further validated clustering.</p>
<p>To explore transcriptional connectivity between neuronal clusters, PAGA <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup> was applied. In the resulting PAGA graph, nodes represented clusters, and edge thickness corresponded to connectivity strength. Globally, the PAGA graph revealed distinct separation between Vgat+ and Vglut2+ clusters. Locally, Vgat+Esr1+ clusters (Vgat2, Vgat4, and Vgat16) exhibited high connectivity and were distinct from other clusters (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref>).</p>

<p>Seurat clustering identified 19 neuronal clusters within the MERFISH dataset, including 10 GABAergic clusters enriched with <italic>Gad1</italic> and 6 excitatory clusters expressing <italic>Slc17a6</italic>. Because <italic>Fos</italic> data from behaviorally naïve animals was unavailable in the MERFISH dataset, <italic>Fos</italic>-enriched clusters were defined using the following approach: For each behavioral category and sex, a threshold for <italic>Fos</italic> enrichment was set at the one-sided 95th percentile expression level. The proportion of cells above this threshold was calculated for each cell type, and Fisher’s exact test was performed to identify <italic>Fos</italic>-enriched clusters (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05 after multiple comparison correction). As <italic>Fos</italic>-enriched clusters were only observed in a subset of GABAergic clusters, subsequent analyses focused exclusively on the correspondence of GABAergic clusters between modalities.</p>
<p>To map MERFISH clusters onto scRNAseq data, reference (MERFISH) and query (scRNAseq, P50) datasets were aligned for each sex using the FindTransferAnchors (CCA1-30) and TransferData functions. This generated a weights matrix (<italic>W</italic>), which was used to transfer cell-type labels through the equation P = LW<sup>T</sup>, where L is a binary classification matrix and P represents label predictions. The imputed MERFISH cluster labels on scRNAseq cells enabled the inference of scRNAseq clusters associated with social behaviors. Genes selectively enriched in scRNAseq clusters linked to sexual behaviors were identified using the FindMarkers function.</p>
<p>The integrative analysis of MERFISH and scRNAseq data, along with enrichment analysis of hormonally associated DEGs (HA-DEGs), consistently demonstrated that Vgat+Esr1+clusters (defined as clusters where &gt;50% of cells express Esr1) were transcriptionally dynamic and strongly linked to sexual behaviors. Consequently, downstream analyses primarily focused on Vgat+Esr1+clusters, while differences with other Vgat+ populations (e.g., Vgat+ Esr1-Ar+ or Vgat+ hormone RLow) were highlighted when relevant.</p>

<title>Gene set activity analysis of scRNAseq data</title>
    <p>To assess the aggregate expression of specific gene sets in single cells, we performed AUCell analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Aibar et al., 2017</xref>).

<title>Trajectory analysis of scRNAseq and HM-HCR FISH data</title>
<p>Monocle 3 was used to quantify adolescent transcriptional progression in scRNAseq and HM-HCR FISH datasets <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>. For scRNAseq data, Seurat clustering results were used to separately analyze Vgat+Esr1+, Vgat+Esr1-Ar+, Vgat+hormoneR<sup>Low</sup>, and Vglut2+Esr1+ clusters in each sex. The preprocessing step involved normalizing and scaling the data using the preprocess_cds function, followed by PCA dimensional reduction based on hormonally associated DEGs (HA-DEGs; using the top 10–15 principal components). The reduce_dimension function was applied to generate UMAP embeddings, and a principal graph in UMAP space was constructed using the learn_graph function with default settings. The root node of the trajectory was assigned to cells from P23 or GDX groups, and pseudotime, representing transcriptional progression from the root state, was computed as the geodesic distance of each cell from the root node in the UMAP.</p>
<p>To test whether hormonally dependent transcriptional trajectories observed in Vgat+Esr1+ cells were also present in other cell types, similar Monocle trajectory analyses were conducted for Vgat+Esr1-Ar+, Vgat+hormoneR<sup>Low</sup>, and Vglut2+Esr1+ cells. Additionally, branches of transcriptional trajectories were analyzed due to the presence of two major branches originating from one or two subpopulations of Vgat+Esr1+ cells in both sexes (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 5</xref>, <xref rid="figs12" ref-type="fig">12</xref>). Branch-specific DEG analysis identified genes enriched in each branch and those shared across branches (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 5</xref>, <xref rid="figs12" ref-type="fig">12</xref>).</p>
<p>In the HM-HCR experiments, seven genes were selected from the top 50 HA-DEGs based on fold change and selectivity (ratio of pct1 to pct2), and two genes (male) or one gene (female) were selected from the top 10 genes enriched in P23 over P50. To confirm that these selected DEGs represented pubertal and adolescent transcriptional states, decoding accuracy of experimental conditions (age and hormonal states; detailed in Decoding Conditions from scRNAseq or HM-HCR FISH) was computed and compared between HCR DEGs and control DEGs (seven from the bottom 50 DEGs and two or one from the bottom 10 genes enriched in P23 over P50; <xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 6k, m</xref>).</p>
<p>Trajectory analysis of HM-HCR data was performed similarly to scRNAseq data using Monocle 3, focusing on Vgat+Esr1+ cells. The primary difference was that log1p values (not normalized by total UMI) were used, as most detected genes were HA-DEGs, and equivalent transcript numbers were not assumed for single cells. To quantify spatial-temporal dynamics of pubertal and adolescent transcriptional progression across ages, hormonal states, and sexes, the MPOA size was normalized across groups. Pseudotime values for the medial and lateral MPOA were computed to identify spatially specific patterns. To examine sex differences in the transcriptional onset of puberty and adolescence, Vgat+Esr1+ cells from P23, P28 (non-hormonally treated controls), and P50 groups were projected into the normalized MPOA space. A transcriptional maturation index was calculated for each P28 cell based on the pseudotime of its neighborhood P23 and P50 cells.</p>
<p>To jointly compute transcriptional trajectories from scRNAseq and HM-HCR data, scRNAseq data was imputed using HM-HCR data via Seurat V3 (<xref rid="figs9" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 9</xref>). In Vgat+Esr1+ cells, <italic>Slc32a1</italic> and one HM-HCR gene were excluded from the scRNAseq dataset. The FindTransferAnchors (CCA) and TransferData functions were used to identify anchors between the HM-HCR reference and the scRNAseq query, generating a weights matrix (<italic>W</italic>). Gene expression features were transferred as P = FW<sup>T</sup>, where F is the gene expression matrix and P is the predicted expression matrix. This process was iterated for all HM-HCR genes to generate predicted scRNAseq data (11–12 genes). The predicted scRNAseq data was validated against the real dataset using Pearson correlation coefficient analysis. Transcriptional trajectories were then learned from the predicted data using the same Monocle pipeline as described above.</p>

<title>MELD analysis</title>
<p>To computationally validate the monocle trajectory analysis of scRNAseq data, we used the MELD Python package, which learns the transition of transcriptional states as the relative likelihood of conditions for each cell in the PHATE space (Potential of Heat-diffusion for Affinity-based Trajectory Embedding) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>. PHATE preserves local and distal relationships of transcriptional states, outperforming other embedding techniques in maintaining the structure of single-cell data. The input data consisted of log-normalized expression values and clustering metadata for Vgat+Esr1+ cells, generated from Seurat V3 analysis. The analysis proceeded in two main steps. First, data was embedded into low-dimensional PHATE space. Principal components (PCs) were computed using scprep.reduce.pca (number of components = 8–15), and PHATE embeddings were generated with phate.PHATE and phate_op.fit_transform using default settings. Second, the kernel density for each condition was estimated to quantify the likelihood of cells belonging to specific states. Conditions were categorized as mature (P50, P35) or immature (P23, GDX) (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 6h-i, j, l</xref>). Kernel density estimation was performed using meld.MELD (beta = 67, knn = 7) and meld_op.fit_transform with default settings. Relative likelihoods for each condition (the probability of observing a cell in each condition) were computed using the replicate_normalize_densities function, which applies L1 normalization across samples. These MELD analyses were used to measure hormonally associated adolescent trajectories, providing computational cross-validation for the monocle trajectory analysis (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 6h-i, j, l</xref>).</p>

<title>DEG and trajectory analysis of scRNAseq in Esr1KO experiments</title>
<p>Data from <italic>Esr1</italic>KO groups were independently processed for quality control, including the removal of low- quality cells and doublets <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref></sup>. Seurat V3 was used to perform clustering and identify neuronal clusters (detailed in Integrative Clustering and Differential Gene Expression Analysis). The dataset included 6,727 cells from <italic>Esr1</italic>KOF (female) and 6,464 cells from <italic>Esr1</italic>KOM (male). Neuronal cells were re-clustered to identify Vgat+ clusters. In females, six Vgat+ clusters (eVgat1–6), seven Vglut2+ clusters (eVglut1–7), and one mixed cluster (eMix1) were identified, while in males, 12 Vgat+ clusters (eVgat1–12), six Vglut2+ clusters (eVglut1–6), and two mixed clusters (eMix1–2) were identified (<xref rid="figs11" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 11</xref>; <italic>Esr1</italic>KOF: 2,182 neuronal cells; <italic>Esr1</italic>KOM: 4,761 neuronal cells).</p>
<p>To identify Vgat+ clusters in the <italic>Esr1</italic>KO group corresponding to specific clusters in the intact (viral-free) group, a Pearson correlation coefficient analysis was performed for each sex. This correlation matrix determined which clusters in the <italic>Esr1</italic>KO dataset corresponded to Vgat+Esr1+ clusters (e.g., Vgat2, 4, 16) or Vgat+hormoneR<sup>Low</sup> clusters (e.g., Vgat14, 17, 20) in the intact group (<xref rid="figs11" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 11</xref>). To address potential experimental variations introduced by viral manipulations, this correspondence was cross-validated using anchor-based integrative analysis. Using the FindTransferAnchors (CCA1-30) and TransferData functions, anchors were identified between the intact group (reference) and <italic>Esr1</italic>KO group (query), constructing a weights matrix (<italic>W</italic>). Labels (cell-type classifications) were transferred using the equation P = LW<sup>T</sup>, where L is a binary classification matrix and P is the label prediction. Label imputation confirmed that eVgat1 and eVgat3 (female), and eVgat3 and eVgat4 (male), corresponded to the Vgat+Esr1+ population of intact groups. Similarly, eVgat5 (female) and eVgat9 (male) were closely related to the Vgat+hormoneR<sup>Low</sup> clusters of P50 groups (<xref rid="figs11" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 11</xref>). Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) specific to <italic>Esr1</italic> were computed using Seurat’s FindMarkers function by comparing the gene expression of Vgat+Esr1+ clusters between intact P50 and <italic>Esr1</italic>KO groups. For trajectory analysis, Vgat+Esr1+ cells from all groups were combined and analyzed using Monocle 3. Principal components were computed based on the same HA-DEGs as described previously, and these were used to construct UMAP embeddings.

<title>Deconstruction of gene regulatory network</title>
<p>To infer the cis-regulation of genes by transcription factors (TFs), we used the SCENIC computational framework <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref></sup>. SCENIC was combined with cell-type-specific gene manipulation to causally infer the gene regulatory network (GRN). First, co-expression scores between TFs and target genes were computed using GENIE3 (runGenie3) based on scRNAseq expression data from Vgat+ cells at P50. TFs were ranked by the sum of their weights for hormonally associated DEGs (HA-DEGs; logFC &gt; 0.25). Among all 952 TFs (female) and 915 TFs (male) in the dataset, <italic>Esr1</italic> achieved the highest sum score in both sexes. These results prompted further scRNAseq analysis of subjects with <italic>Esr1</italic> deleted in Vgat+ cells in the MPOA (detailed in Trajectory Analysis of scRNAseq in <italic>Esr1</italic>KO Experiments). After identifying Vgat+Esr1+ clusters, genes reduced by <italic>Esr1</italic> deletion (<italic>Esr1</italic>-DEGs) were identified using the FindMarkers function in Seurat V3. To determine which <italic>Esr1</italic>-DEGs were cis-regulated by <italic>Esr1</italic>, we applied the RcisTarget package. The RcisTarget database (mm9-tss-centered-10kb-7species.mc9nr.feather) was used to score motifs within the transcription start site (TSS) ±10 kb region and annotate associated TFs. Overrepresentation of each motif was assessed using the calcAUC function, and significantly enriched motifs were identified using the addMotifAnnotation function (normalized enrichment score threshold: NES ≥ 2). This analysis identified 123 genes in females and 98 genes in males that were significantly enriched with <italic>Esr1</italic> motifs. Of these, 9 (female) and 6 (male) genes were TFs (<italic>Esr1</italic>-TFs). To investigate whether <italic>Esr1</italic>-TFs could cis-regulate <italic>Esr1</italic>-DEGs, we repeated RcisTarget analysis for pairs of <italic>Esr1</italic>-TFs and <italic>Esr1</italic>-DEGs. These analyses allowed us to infer genes cis-regulated by <italic>Esr1</italic> or each <italic>Esr1</italic>-TF, collectively defining regulons for each TF. Using these regulons, we constructed the <italic>Esr1</italic>-GRN with the igraph package. In the <italic>Esr1</italic>-GRN, regulons were categorized and highlighted based on gene ontology (detailed in Ontology Analysis, <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8d-e</xref>, and <xref rid="figs13" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 13</xref>).

<title>Single-cell consensus weighted gene co-expression network analysis</title>
<p>Single-cell consensus-weighted gene co-expression network analysis (scWGCNA) was employed to identify sex-specific co-expression networks in Vgat+Esr1+ cells <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref></sup>. The analysis aimed to detect modules (groups of coexpressed genes) highly expressed in Vgat+Esr1+ clusters. To begin, metacells were constructed using the MetacellsByGroups function. Co-expression networks were then generated with the ConstructNetwork function, using the optimal soft-power threshold identified through TestSoftPowers. Module eigengenes (MEs), which represent the principal component of gene expression for each module, were computed using the ModuleEigengenes function. Module connectivity, calculated with the ModuleConnectivity function, was used to identify hub genes—those highly connected within each module. The top 25 hub genes and their connectivity were visualized using the ModuleNetworkPlot function. This analysis revealed nine modules in females and six modules in males that were highly expressed in Vgat+Esr1+ cells (Vgat2, 4, 16). Functional enrichment for each module was assessed using Enrichr via the RunEnrichr function <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref></sup>.

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this manuscript the authors test the hypothesis that gonadal steroid signaling influences the transcriptional development of specific neurons in the mPOA during adolescence, and that such adolescent development of the mPOA is necessary for mating behaviors.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors establish a role GABAergic-Esr1 neurons in mating behaviors of both male and female mice. Differentially expressed genes are compared across adolescent development and between sexes. Single-cell sequencing is used to resolve clusters of cells based on transcript levels, and in situ hybridization is used to visualize anatomical expression patterns. The research presented is thorough and rigorous and contributes new insight into hormone-sensitive transcriptional profiles within genetically defined neuron clusters in the mPOA during adolescence.</p>
<p>Weaknesses: Two minor comments</p>
<p>(1) Fig 4 (hormone treatment): In this experiment, testosterone is given to males, yet in Sup Fig 6 it is argued that Esr1 is more influential in driving transcriptional changes compared to AR. Does DHT treatment have the same outcome as testosterone? Or, does estrogen treatment in males have the same outcome as testosterone?</p>
<p>(2) Fig 3i: There appears to be an age-dependent transcriptional change in male Vgat HR-low cells. Can the authors comment on age-dependent (hormone-independent) transcriptional changes in males versus females.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>An abundant literature documents molecular changes in the rodent hypothalamus that occur during the transition from prepubertal to mature reproductive physiology. Equally well documented is the role of sex steroids and their receptors during this important period of reproductive development, as well as the importance of GABAergic and glutamatergic neurons. The medial preoptic area (MPOA) is known to play a central role in expression of sexually dimorphic reproductive function and previously reported sexually dimorphic patterns of gene expression are consistent with this role. The present manuscript extends this knowledge base and reports the results of a detailed evaluation of transcriptional dynamics in the MPOA during the adolescent transition to maturity with a particular focus on the role of the estrogen receptor gene (Esr1). Both single cell RNA sequencing (scRNseq) and multiplex in situ hybridization methods were employed and the results subjected to detailed computational analyses to demonstrate that the transcriptomic structure of MPOA neurons displays both sex and cell type specific expression profiles. In addition, both hormonal and genetic manipulations of Esr1 signaling during puberty altered the transcriptional profiles of MPOA neurons, and these changes aligned with maturation of hormone-dependent reproductive function. The authors provide this evidence to illustrate Esr1 dependent control of gene regulatory networks required for normal expression of reproductive behaviors expressed during the transition from adolescence to adulthood. The results presented in this manuscript are extensive and represent the most comprehensive evaluation of transcriptomic changes during reproductive maturation to date. The methods appear strong and the results provide a rich data set that will support a good deal of future analysis. Despite these strengths, the authors are encouraged to revise their manuscript to address significant gaps in their presentation, as well as clarify or improve their conclusions.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) The major strength of this manuscript is the extensive set of images and graphs that illustrate molecular changes that occur in MPOA neurons during adolescence, although additional spatial detail as to locations of the source neurons would be welcome in order to place the changes in the proper circuitry context.</p>
<p>(2) Targeting Esr1 deletion to MPOA GABA neurons is a good choice, given how these cells have been implicated in sexual differentiation of reproductive behavior previously, and the lack of comparable responses in glutamatergic neurons is convincing. The AAV-frtFlex-Cre virus created by the investigators is a most useful tool for such studies. Profiling distinct transcriptomic trajectories in GABA and glutamatergic neurons during reproductive maturation is impressive and leads to some of the best supported conclusions in this paper.</p>
<p>(3) Cellular and molecular resolution of the transcriptomics data appears excellent, however, because the source tissue for the scRNAseq analysis was obtained by bulk dissection of the MPOA anatomical resolution is limited. This problem is addressed to some extent by careful comparison of scRNAseq results with previously published spatial transcriptomics data. The HM-HCR-FISH analysis clearly documents spatially restricted changes in gene expression, but it is hard to discern where these changes occur based on the images presented or the descriptions included in the Results. The anatomical schematic included in Figure 4 suggests that investigators are not familiar with components of the MPOA (see Allen Mouse Brain Atlas).</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) A major conceptual flaw is that the authors do not distinguish between genetically determined sex differences in patterns of gene expression and differences caused by the fact that MPOA neurons are exposed to different endocrine environments in adolescent males and females, which can cause different transcriptional trajectories independent of genetic sex. This issue does not render their results invalid, but their terminology should address the issue in the discussion and &quot;limitations&quot; section. At the very least the endocrine status of &quot;intact females&quot; should be included.</p>
<p>(2) A major technical flaw is that the MPOA is treated as a functionally distinct brain region (block dissections) with uniform distribution of cell types (FISH data are not illustrated or reported with sufficient spatial detail). Thus, an enormous amount of molecular data is provided that cannot be mapped to distinct neural circuits, thereby limiting the neurobiological impact. This is also a weakness of the FISH data, which is presented with only small regions illustrated without anatomical detail. In fact, some images are compared that appear to illustrate different MPOA structures, although it is impossible to be certain of this due to the lack of morphological landmarks. The analysis of how Esr1 orchestrates regulatory gene networks is impressive and interesting, but the fact that many of the observed transcriptional events occur in neural circuits that do not overlap confounds interpretation.</p>
<p>(3) The locations of the AAV injections should be characterized because deleting Esr1 in multiple distinct parts of the MPOA will likely confound interpretation. This is especially problematic given the limited number of mice used for parts of the RNAscope analysis.</p>
<p>(4) Although the focus of these experiments on adolescence is welcome, neither the Introduction nor the Discussion do a good job of placing these studies in the context of what is already known about brain maturation during puberty. It is true that this is very much a results-focused manuscript, but the scholarship can be improved. Simply stating that your results are consistent with previous reports places an undue burden on the reader to go figure out what is new.</p>
<p>(5) Throughout the manuscript the authors utilize obscure abbreviations, which often makes reading their text overly cumbersome. This is certainly justified in certain instances where complex names of analytical methods are used repeatedly, but the authors are encouraged to try and simplify their use of non-standard abbreviations.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Hashikawa and colleagues analyze estrogen signaling in the medial preoptic area using scRNA-sequencing, RNA in situ hybridization, and specific disruption of Esr1 in glutamatergic or GABAergic neurons. They conclude that Esr1 &quot;plays a pivotal role in the transcriptional maturation of GABAergic neurons within the MPOA during adolescence&quot;. Overall, the findings are mostly consistent with previous literature but bring additional molecular evidence and timing effects that focus on adolescence rather than the perinatal period. The most surprising results are the lack of effects of Esr1 or adolescence-associated hormone changes in glutamatergic neurons, but this seems like it could be due to limited behavioral and physiological phenotyping as well as limited transcriptomic sampling.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Strengths of this paper are the multiple complementary approaches and the spatially specific disruption of Esr1 in two different neuronal populations of the MPOA. These data add more molecular insights to our understanding of how this region is shaped by hormone changes during adolescence.</p>
<p>The idea that Esr1 regulates &quot;transcriptional maturation&quot; is interesting. This term should be explicitly defined (as well as &quot;arrested adolescent transcriptional progression&quot;) and distinguished from general effects of steroid signaling. To what degree does Esr1 disruption narrowly affect genes indicative of transcriptional maturation? The paper highlights specific neuropeptide genes (e.g., Nts, Pdyn, Tac1) that might be estrogen-dependent rather than broad indicators of transcriptional maturation.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>We already know that Esr1 is important within GABAergic but not glutamatergic neurons for mating behavior. However, there is not enough data to support the claim that disrupting Esr1 in glutamatergic MPOA neurons &quot;had no observable effect.&quot; The MPOA is involved in many behaviors and physiologies that were not investigated. More assays would be required to report &quot;no observable effect.&quot;</p>
<p>The small number of cells included in the transcriptional studies is a general concern, as noted by the authors. This is a particular concern for conclusions related to the role of adolescence in glutamatergic MPOA neurons. The paper reports 24,627 neurons across all treatment groups, which include 3 timepoints, 2 sexes, and GDX conditions. It seems likely that not much was detected in the glutamatergic neurons because of insufficient power.</p>
<p>Esr1 knockout is initiated in adolescence, not restricted to adolescence. Do we know that the effects on mating behavior are due to what is happening in adolescence vs. the function of Esr1 in adults? Are the effects different if Esr1 is knocked out in mature adults? This comparison would be important to demonstrate that adolescence is a critical time window for Esr1 function.</p>
