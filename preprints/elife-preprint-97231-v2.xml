<title>Abstract</title><p>The conformational ensemble and function of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) are sensitive to their solution environment. The inherent malleability of disordered proteins combined with the exposure of their residues accounts for this sensitivity. One context in which IDPs play important roles that is concomitant with massive changes to the intracellular environment is during desiccation (extreme drying). The ability of organisms to survive desiccation has long been linked to the accumulation of high levels of cosolutes such as trehalose or sucrose as well as the enrichment of IDPs, such as late embryogenesis abundant (LEA) proteins or cytoplasmic abundant heat soluble (CAHS) proteins. Despite knowing that IDPs play important roles and are co-enriched alongside endogenous, species-specific cosolutes during desiccation, little is known mechanistically about how IDP-cosolute interactions influence desiccation tolerance. Here, we test the notion that the protective function of desiccation-related IDPs is enhanced through conformational changes induced by endogenous cosolutes. We find that desiccation-related IDPs derived from four different organisms spanning two LEA protein families and the CAHS protein family, synergize best with endogenous cosolutes during drying to promote desiccation protection. Yet the structural parameters of protective IDPs do not correlate with synergy for either CAHS or LEA proteins. We further demonstrate that for CAHS, but not LEA proteins, synergy is related to self-assembly and the formation of a gel. Our results suggest that functional synergy between IDPs and endogenous cosolutes is a convergent desiccation protection strategy seen among different IDP families and organisms, yet, the mechanisms underlying this synergy differ between IDP families.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) make up about 40% of the eukaryotic proteome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>]. Unlike typical well-folded proteins, IDPs are characterized by a lack of defined tertiary structure, and instead exist as an ensemble of dynamic, interconverting conformations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>]. Despite their disordered nature, IDPs are known to play important roles in many biological processes including regulation of transcription and translation, metabolic signaling, subcellular organization, molecular chaperoning and response and adaptation to environmental cues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>].</p>
<p>Despite lacking a stable three-dimensional structure, IDPs still follow a similar paradigm by which form begets function. Different from well-folded proteins, however, an IDPâs sequence determines the ensemble of conformations it adopts, and this ensemble can be important for the IDPâs function(s) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>]. However, sequence is not the only determinant of the conformations present in an IDPâs ensemble [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>]. This is because IDP ensembles have relatively few intramolecular bonds and a large solvent-accessible surface area, which makes their ensembles more sensitive to the physicochemical environment than the relatively rigid structures of well-folded proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>].</p>
<p>The sensitivity of IDP ensembles to their solution environment and their link to IDP function poses a fundamental question: how do sequence and solution combine to tune IDP ensemble and function? To explore this question, we focus on a biological phenomenon where the intracellular environment undergoes drastic physical chemical changes: desiccation.</p>
<p>Organisms across every biological kingdom can survive near-complete desiccation by entering a state of reversible suspended metabolism known as anhydrobiosis (from Greek for âlife without waterâ) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>]. As water effluxes from the cell during drying, the concentration of cosolutes increases by orders of magnitude, dramatically changing the physicochemistry of the cell [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>]. In addition to the decrease in water content and concomitant increase in cosolute concentrations, the composition of the intracellular environment changes massively because of a regulated metabolomic response to drying mounted by anhydrobiotic organisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>].</p>
<p>The acquisition of desiccation tolerance has historically been linked to the intracellular buildup of cosolutes such as trehalose, sucrose, arabinose, stachyose, and raffinose in plants and trehalose in some animals, fungi, and bacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>]. More recently, the accumulation of high levels of IDPs has also been linked to desiccation tolerance in many organisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>]. Common examples of desiccation-related IDPs include the late embryogenesis abundant (LEA) proteins, which are the most widely studied desiccation-related IDPs due to their early identification and widespread distribution among different species and kingdoms of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>]. LEA proteins are classified into seven different families based on the presence of conserved motif sequences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>]. Another family of desiccation-related IDPs are the tardigrade-specific cytosolic abundant heat soluble (CAHS) proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>].</p>
<p>Simultaneous enrichment of disordered proteins and endogenous cosolutes during desiccation promotes an ideal setting in which to study IDP-cosolute interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>]. In the desiccation field, these interactions have been observed to produce a functional synergy in promoting tolerance to drying. Trehalose, a cosolute enriched alongside IDPs in many desiccation tolerant systems, has previously been shown to enhance IDP protective function <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>]. These observations prompted us to ask about the specificity of these interactions and if desiccation-related IDPs may have coevolved to work synergistically alongside their endogenously enriched cosolutes to promote desiccation protection.</p>
<p>To test whether desiccation-related IDP sequences have evolved to work with their intracellular chemical environment, here we use representative proteins from three families of IDPs: one CAHS protein (CAHS D) and proteins from two LEA families. Our result shows that full-length CAHS D and LEA proteins derived from four different organisms synergize better with endogenous protective cosolutes compared to protective exogenous cosolutes from other organisms.</p>
<p>To reveal the underpinnings of cosolute:IDP synergy, we examine the secondary and tertiary structure of protective IDPs in the presence of two disaccharides that are similar in terms of size but distinct with respect to chemistry and use across taxa. In all cases, the secondary structure (residual helicity) and tertiary structure (radius of gyration) do not change significantly in the presence of synergistic cosolutes and thus cannot explain the enhancement in function observed with synergistic cosolutes. We next assessed quaternary structure as both CAHS and LEA proteins are known to oligomerize [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>], and for CAHS proteins, oligomerization leads to gelation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>]. While synergistic cosolutes did not influence LEA oligomerization, CAHS D oligomerization and gelation were enhanced in the presence of synergistic cosolutes. We further show that CAHS Dâs synergy can be explained through direct repulsive interactions between cosolutes and CAHS Dâs sidechains. However, this explanation does not hold for LEA proteins, implying that synergy in different protein families occurs through distinct mechanisms.</p>
<p>Our study showcases that different families of protective IDPs can have orthogonal modes of action and different functions in divergent solution environments. Beyond expanding our understanding of desiccation tolerance, these findings shed light on the sensitivity of IDP ensemble and function to the chemical composition of their environment. This is important as IDPs are ubiquitous across biology and function in key developmental processes and disease states that are concomitant with large changes in intracellular chemistry. Understanding how disordered proteins interact and evolve with the solution environment will provide insights into these biological mechanisms and phenomena.</p>

<title>Desiccation-related IDPs are enriched in organisms alongside specific cosolutes during drying</title>
<p>To test whether IDP sequences have evolved to be functionally-tuned by the composition of the intracellular environment during drying, we selected six desiccation-related IDPs. These IDPs come from two LEA families [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>] as well as the CAHS family (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). We selected four LEA_4 proteins each from a different desiccation tolerant organism. These organisms include the plant <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> (AtLEA3-3), the nematode <italic>Aphelenchus avenae</italic> (AavLEA1), the tardigrade <italic>Hypsibius exemplaris</italic> (HeLEA68614), and the rotifer <italic>Adineta vaga</italic> (AvLEA1C) (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). To assess whether synergy extends across LEA families, we selected a LEA_1 protein from <italic>A. thaliana</italic> (AtLEA4-2) (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Finally, CAHS D was selected from the tardigrade <italic>H. exemplaris</italic> (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). These organisms were selected not only because they all utilize LEA proteins to survive desiccation, but also because they accumulate different disaccharides to varying degrees during drying [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>] (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).

<title>LEA motifs are not sufficient to mediate synergistic interaction with endogenous cosolutes during desiccation</title>
<p>To assess whether endogenous cosolutes induce functional changes in desiccation-related IDPs, we began by testing peptides encoding LEA motifs derived from full-length LEA_4 and LEA_1 proteins (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Family 1 LEA (LEA_1) proteins are characterized by a 20-mer repeating motif, whereas Family 4 LEA (LEA_4) proteins are characterized by the repetition of an 11-mer LEA_4 motif [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>]. These motifs are often found in multiple linear or nonlinear repeats across the length of a LEA protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>]. Interestingly, LEA_4 motifs have previously been suggested to be sufficient to confer desiccation protection to desiccation-sensitive proteins and membranes to a degree similar to full-length LEA proteins, both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>]. With this in mind, we expected to observe synergy between LEA motif repeats and their paired endogenous cosolute(s).</p>
<p>We generated 11-mer LEA_4 motif peptides (At11, Aav11, He11, and Av11) and a 20-mer LEA_1 peptide (At20) and measured the ability of these motifs to protect lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), a desiccation sensitive enzyme during drying. LDH assay is used to assess the function of desiccation protectants to protect the activity of LDH which otherwise retains only approximately 2% of its pre-desiccation activity when dried and rehydrated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>].</p>
<p>The protective capacity for each LEA motif and cosolute was assessed across a range of concentrations with LDH (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). Most LEA_4 motifs displayed levels of protection so low that a 50% level of protection could not be reached even at concentrations exceeding 1 mM (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A&amp;B</xref>, <xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1A</xref>). Additionally, higher concentrations of the LEA_4 motifs tend to inactivate the enzyme when kept under control conditions (4 Â°C, see Methods), over a 16 hour incubation period during the assay (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1C</xref>). The LEA_1 20-mer motif At20, however, showed robust concentration-dependent protection of LDH, demonstrating that LEA_4 and LEA_1 motifs are functionally distinct (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A&amp;B</xref>, <xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1A</xref>). Concentration-dependent protection was also observed for our cosolutes trehalose and sucrose (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>, <xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1A</xref>).</p>

<p>Since LEA_4 motifs often exist in tandem repeats of 11-mers within a full-length LEA protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>], we wondered if the observed lack of protection was a result of their short length or repeat number. We synthesized 2X (At22) and 4X (At44) tandem repeats of the <italic>A. thaliana</italic> 11-mer LEA_4 motif (At11). At22 and At44 show minimal potency in preserving <italic>in vitro</italic> LDH function during drying (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>, <xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1A</xref>).</p>
<p>Despite the low protection displayed by our LEA_4 peptides, we opted to use them in cosolute synergy assays, as we reasoned that perhaps they would become functional when in solution with trehalose or sucrose. We picked sub-optimal concentrations of protectants (<xref rid="tblS1" ref-type="table">Table S1</xref>) so that under instances of synergistic protection, the additive protection of cosolute:peptide mixtures would not exceed 100%. We then performed synergy assays where sucrose or trehalose was combined with LEA motifs at molar ratios of 1:100, 1:10, 1:1, 10:1, and 100:1 (cosolute:protein). The upper limit (10:1 and 100:1) of these ratios closely align with known cosolute:protein ratios that produce synergistic protection between the tardigrade disordered protein CAHS D and trehalose [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>]. Here we report on synergy by showing the individual protective ability of the cosolute and IDP on its own, the sum of these protective values (hypothetical additive effect), and the actual measured protection produced by combination of the cosolute and peptide (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>). We quantify synergy using the following equation:
<disp-formula>
<graphic xlink:href="582506v2_ueqn1.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula>
In nearly all cases, synergy was not observed for 11-mer LEA_4 peptides with either sucrose or trehalose (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D&amp;E</xref>, <xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1B</xref>). In fact, in several cases, mixing LEA_4 peptides with sucrose or trehalose elicited antagonistic, rather than synergistic, effects (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D&amp;E</xref>, <xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1B</xref>). These results suggest that LEA_4 motifs do not robustly preserve LDH function, nor do they interact with cosolutes trehalose or sucrose in a functionally productive fashion. Similar to 11-mer motifs, the <italic>A. thaliana</italic> 22- and 44-mer peptides did not synergize with either trehalose or sucrose (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D&amp;E</xref>, <xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1B</xref>). Unlike LEA_4 motifs, the 20-mer LEA_1 motif, At20, was both protective and synergized with both trehalose and sucrose (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D&amp;E</xref>, <xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1B</xref>).</p>
<p>Taken together, these experiments demonstrate a diversity in disordered protein/motif function, where LEA_4 motifs largely are not protective to the enzyme LDH during drying, nor are they synergistic with endogenous cosolutes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F</xref>). Conversely, the LEA_1 motif tested is highly protective and synergizes with either sucrose or trehalose (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F</xref>).</p>

<title>Desiccation-related IDPs synergize with endogenous cosolutes</title>
<p>While LEA proteins are identified through homology in conserved LEA motif repeats, they also contain varying quantities of non-motif sequence (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Since we observed that LEA_4 motifs generally provide relatively little protection and tend not to synergize with endogenous cosolutes in LDH assays, we wondered if full-length LEA proteins might. We also included CAHS D in our analysis as it has been previously known to synergize with trehalose and, to a lesser extent, with sucrose [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>].</p>
<p>We began by testing the baseline protection of our proteins using the LDH assay. All full-length LEA_1 and LEA_4 proteins confer protection for LDH activity up to the pre-desiccated value (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>, <xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2A</xref>). Likewise, CAHS D provided concentration-dependent protection to LDH as previously observed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>] (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>, <xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2A</xref>). We also included bovine serum albumin (BSA) in these studies as a well-studied control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>]. Unlike the LEA motifs, most full-length proteins protected 50% LDH at concentrations less than 1 mM (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>).</p>

<p>Using data derived from the concentration range of LDH assays, we chose a sub-optimal concentration that provides 15-45% protection for each protein to perform synergy experiments with (<xref rid="tblS2" ref-type="table">Table S2</xref>). Our results show that nearly all full-length IDPs showed synergy with either sucrose or trehalose or both (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C&amp;D</xref>). Exceptions to this are AvLEA1C, which is derived from a rotifer that accumulates neither trehalose nor sucrose, and BSA, which comes from cows, which of course have no capacity for anhydrobiosis. Remarkably, in cases where LEA proteins displayed synergy, they were always more synergistic with endogenous compared to exogenous cosolutes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref>). We also calculated synergy using two different approaches: one using equilibrium constant (K<sub>app</sub>) as a metric and other using the Bliss independent model. Our results for synergy are largely invariant regardless of the method we use (<xref rid="figS3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3A-F</xref>).</p>
<p>Taken together, these experiments demonstrate that synergistic interactions between IDPs and cosolutes extend across multiple families of desiccation-related IDPs found in a variety of organisms. Our data shows that these six IDPs synergize best with their endogenous cosolute to promote desiccation tolerance and we speculate that this may apply to other desiccation-related IDPs. It is also of note that while many of the LEA motifs tested at the beginning of this study did not display synergy with trehalose or sucrose, corresponding full-length proteins did. Likewise, At20 showed synergy with both trehalose and sucrose, while full-length AtLEA4-2 was only synergistic with sucrose. Thus, not only do these experiments demonstrate that full-length LEA proteins synergize with their endogenous cosolute(s) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref>), but they suggest that this synergy, at least in part, is driven by sequence features beyond conserved motifs.</p>

<title>Trehalose and sucrose do not elicit local ensemble changes to desiccation-related IDPs in solution or in the dry state under the conditions tested</title>
<p>We next wondered what mechanism(s) drive the functional synergy observed between desiccation-protective IDPs and endogenous cosolutes. We reasoned that functional synergy might be driven by cosolute-induced changes to the IDP ensemble. To test this, we first examined the secondary structure contained in the ensemble of LEA proteins and CAHS D using circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy.</p>
<p>Each full-length protein was first assessed using CD in an aqueous state by itself (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). All full-length LEA proteins displayed a single minimum at â¼200 nm (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>, black) indicating that LEA proteins are disordered in the aqueous state. CAHS D also displayed a minimum at â¼200 nm and a slight minimum around â¼220 nm, indicating that while disordered, it also has some propensity for helical structure in solution (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>, black), in line with previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>]. This is in contrast to BSA, which showed a high propensity for helical structure as denoted by the double minima at 222 and 210 nm (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>, black). To see if the addition of cosolutes induces secondary structural change in the aqueous state, we obtained CD spectra of cosolute:protein mixtures at 100:1 molar ratios. Somewhat to our surprise, trehalose (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A&amp;C</xref>, blue) and sucrose (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A&amp;C</xref>, green) do not induce any significant structural changes to any of the full-length IDPs tested here (<xref rid="figS4" ref-type="fig">Fig. S4A</xref>).</p>

<p>LEA proteins gain helical conformation upon drying or in response to low water availability. Drying-induced helicity has been postulated to drive their protective function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>]. We reasoned that while our cosolutes do not induce detectable changes to LEA/CAHS secondary structure in solution, cosolutes could induce structural changes in proteins in a dry state. To test this, we examined our proteins using CD in a desiccated state [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>]. Our results show a significant structural change for all LEA proteins and CAHS D in the dry state, indicated by a shift from disordered spectra with a minimum at â¼200 nm to a helical structure with two minima at â¼222 and â¼210 nm (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>). This is in contrast to BSA which started out helical and showed little change in the spectrum (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>). These changes manifest for pure proteins without any addition of synergistic cosolutes. To quantify the influence of drying on secondary structure, we examined the changes in the ratio of CD signal at 222 and 210 nm. This ratiometric value reports on secondary structure in a concentration-independent way [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>]. Using this metric, all LEAs and CAHS D display a clear increase in helical propensity upon being desiccated (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>). On the other hand, the helical propensity of BSA remains very similar to its hydrated state, indicating that no dramatic structural change took place (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>).</p>
<p>Next, we examined combinations of our proteins with trehalose or sucrose in a desiccated state. As with aqueous samples, the addition of trehalose or sucrose did not induce significant changes in the secondary structure of LEA and CAHS D proteins in the dry state (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B&amp;C</xref>, <xref rid="figS4" ref-type="fig">Fig. S4B</xref>). To assess whether there is a link between the minimal structural changes we observed and functional synergy in LDH assays, the change in the ratio of signal at 210 and 222 nm in desiccated and aqueous states was compared to synergy observed for that same mixture. Synergistic protection observed in our LDH assays did not correlate with secondary structural changes with the addition of trehalose (p = 0.9863 for aqueous, p = 0.1113 for desiccated, <xref rid="figS4" ref-type="fig">Fig. S4C&amp;D</xref>) or sucrose (p = 0.6673 for aqueous, p = 0.9863 for desiccated, <xref rid="figS4" ref-type="fig">Fig. S4E&amp;F</xref>).</p>
<p>Taken together, these results indicate that while the tested LEA proteins and CAHS D undergo a structural transition during desiccation, this phenomenon does not require, nor is it affected by, the presence of trehalose and sucrose. Furthermore, synergistic protection observed in our LDH assays is not mediated by local ensemble changes in these IDPs.</p>

<title>Trehalose and sucrose do not elicit changes in global ensemble dimensions for desiccation-related IDPs under the tested conditions, but promote oligomerization of CAHS D</title>
<p>We next wondered if the synergistic interactions observed between our IDPs and cosolutes could instead be explained by a change in global dimensions, such as expansion or compaction of the protein. To measure global dimensions, which cannot be detected using CD, we used small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), which allows a model-free estimation of the radius of gyration (R<sub>g</sub>) of an IDP as well as a prediction of the molecular weight (see Methods) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>]. Each protein, at a concentration of 4 mg/mL, was measured with no cosolute and with different molar ratios of trehalose and sucrose. We reasoned that a cosolute-dependent change in the radius of gyration (R<sub>g</sub>) could indicate changes in tertiary or quaternary structure, which may correlate with increased function or synergy. We note that for SAXS experiments cosolutes were used at concentrations between 20 and 50 mM due to technical restrictions on how much protein can accurately be assayed and a desire to maintain molar ratios used in other experiments.</p>
<p>We began by testing the R<sub>g</sub> of BSA in different solution conditions. As a well-folded protein, we expected that BSA would be relatively insensitive to changes in the solution environment. The R<sub>g</sub> values obtained via this approach match existing literature (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>]. Additionally, adding cosolutes did not modulate R<sub>g</sub> (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>, <xref rid="figS5" ref-type="fig">Fig. S5A</xref>). While our molecular weight approximations trended higher than expected for monomeric BSA, we reason that this may be due to the propensity of BSA to form small populations of low-level oligomers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>].</p>

<p>We next measured the R<sub>g</sub> of our LEA proteins in various solution conditions. We observed that regardless of the solution environment, all of our LEA proteins have an R<sub>g</sub> that falls within error of readings in other solution environments (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B-F</xref>). At the concentrations used here, cosolutes do not induce significant changes in the global dimensions of LEA proteins. While the predicted molecular weight (pMW) from SAXS for these proteins were somewhat variable, we see no consistent trend between the presence of cosolutes and change in pMW for any LEA protein (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B-F</xref>).</p>
<p>Finally, we tested CAHS D in similar solution conditions. We obtained an R<sub>g</sub> value for CAHS D that lies between the values reported by other groups (see Methods) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>]. While this R<sub>g</sub> was consistent in 1.6:1 disaccharide solutions, 16:1 disaccharide solutions, and 160:1 sucrose solution, we found that the 160:1 trehalose solution had a Guinier region that was sharply curved upwards, even upon the proteinâs first exposure to the X-ray source (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4G</xref>, <xref rid="figS5" ref-type="fig">Fig. S5G</xref>). This is consistent with the presence of large oligomerized species. A Bayesian approximation of the molecular weight of these samples supported this result (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4G</xref>). Most of our CAHS D samples showed a pMW that was only slightly elevated from the known value for the monomeric protein. In contrast, the 160:1 sucrose sample had a pMW about 300% higher than other samples, and the 160:1 trehalose sample had a pMW about 1000% higher (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4G</xref>).</p>
<p>While SAXS shows little change in Rg or pMW for LEA proteins, there is evidence that not only CAHS D but also some LEA proteins tend to oligomerize [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>]. However, LEA oligomerization appears to be weak and transient, requiring extreme crowding and/or sensitive methods to detect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>]. We therefore wanted to use a more sensitive method to assess LEA oligomers, and how they might be affected by cosolutes.</p>
<p>To characterize oligomerization of LEA proteins in a more sensitive fashion, we used photo-induced crosslinking of unmodified proteins (PICUP), a zero-length crosslinking method that uses a light activatable crosslinking system and is known to capture transient oligomeric species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref>]. PICUP has previously been used to characterize oligomeric forms in LEA proteins <italic>in vitro</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref>]. All of our LEA proteins showed a propensity to form oligomers, even at low concentrations (<xref rid="figS6" ref-type="fig">Fig. S6</xref>). However, the presence of trehalose or sucrose did not elicit changes in oligomeric populations (<xref rid="figS6" ref-type="fig">Fig. S6</xref>). These results confirm that LEA proteins are able to form transient oligomers, but also demonstrate that at levels where sucrose and trehalose are synergistic with these proteins oligomerization is unaffected.</p>
<p>Taken together, these results show a divergence in the behavior of LEA and CAHS proteins in the presence of synergistic cosolutes. For CAHS D, the SAXS data suggests a relationship between the presence of cosolutes and increased oligomerization. However, this dataset showed no evidence of a cosolute inducible increase in molecular weight or R<sub>g</sub> for the five LEA proteins that we tested, at least at the concentrations used in this study. This was further supported by PICUP, which despite detecting LEA oligomers did not show that they were enhanced by cosolutes. Thus, our data suggests that CAHS D oligomerization is promoted by the presence of synergistic cosolutes while LEA oligomerization is not.</p>

<title>Synergistic cosolutes promote gelation of CAHS D but not LEA proteins</title>
<p>CAHS D oligomers, as well as those of other CAHS proteins, have been reported to undergo self-assembly to form a gel network [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref>]. We wondered if the cosolute induced oligomerization of CAHS proteins in the presence of trehalose as seen in the SAXS experiments could be attributed to the propensity of CAHS D to form gels.</p>
<p>To test this, we performed differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) on CAHS D to observe the presence or absence of a gel melt. To begin, we tested CAHS D at 6 mg/mL (0.235 mM), which has previously been established to be a non-gelling concentration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>]. Consistent with this, at 0.235 mM, we find that CAHS D does not undergo a characteristic gel melt indicating a lack of gelation (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>, black). Addition of trehalose and sucrose at increasing molar ratios (1:1, 10:1, 100:1, and 500:1) showed thermal features characteristic of endothermic phase transitions (e.g., a gel melting), indicating that the presence of these cosolutes induced gelation (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>). Measuring the area under these melt curves allows us to calculate the enthalpy of melting (<xref rid="figS7" ref-type="fig">Fig. S7A</xref>). Change in enthalpy measurements for the cosolute:protein mixtures relative to the protein provides us a quantification of how gelation is affected by different amounts of cosolutes. Trehalose induced significant gelation at a 100:1 ratio, while 500:1 of sucrose was required to induce a significant gel melt (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>). This is consistent with trehalose producing larger oligomeric species in our SAXS experiments (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4G</xref>), indicating that trehalose has a larger influence than sucrose on the gelation of CAHS D (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>Furthermore, to test whether synergistic cosolutes enhance gelation, we tested CAHS D at 12 mg/mL (0.47 mM), a concentration above CAHS Dâs gelation threshold [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>]. Addition of trehalose or sucrose at increasing molar concentrations promoted the formation of stronger gels evident by the enthalpy of melting measurements (<xref rid="figS7" ref-type="fig">Fig. S7B-E</xref>). These experiments demonstrate that not only do trehalose and sucrose induce sub-gelling concentrations of CAHS D to form gels, but they also enhance the strength of gels formed by higher concentrations of the protein.</p>
<p>Unlike CAHS proteins, gelation of LEA proteins has not been commonly observed or reported. The exception to this is AfrLEA6 (a LEA protein from the brine shrimp <italic>A. franciscana</italic>) that appears to undergo phase separation, forming a hydrogel-like matrix upon desiccation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref>]. To see if our LEA proteins gel, we performed DSC experiments on our LEA proteins and cosolutes. We analyzed similar molar concentrations of LEA proteins on their own and in mixtures with cosolutes at equivalent ratios (1:1, 10:1, 100:1, and 500:1). None of our LEA proteins by themselves or in mixtures with trehalose or sucrose show evidence of gelation (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B-G</xref>). Likewise, BSA also failed to form a gel (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5H</xref>).</p>
<p>Taken together, these results demonstrate that trehalose and sucrose affect the oligomerization and phase state of different IDPs in distinct ways. The observation that trehalose induces more synergy as well as more gelation of CAHS D relative to sucrose leads us to speculate that gelation of CAHS D and synergistic protection of LDH may be linked.</p>

This is calculated by finding the free energy of CAHS Dâs monomeric state upon transfer to an osmolyte solution <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="582506v2_inline2.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>, doing the same for the dimeric state <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="582506v2_inline3.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>, and then taking the difference (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>). A strong negative value for <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="582506v2_inline4.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> indicates that the presence of the cosolute pushes the population towards dimers. A positive value indicates that the addition of the cosolute pushes the population towards monomers.</p>
<p>In order to perform these calculations, we utilized AlphaFold2 and AlphaFold2 Multimer to determine plausible conformations for both CAHS Dâs monomeric and dimeric state. These structures have a helical linker region, which is consistent with our CD measurements (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A&amp;B</xref>) and is consistent with previous reports for this protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>]. We reasoned that dimerization is indicative of gelation since CAHS D dimers were especially prevalent in crosslinking data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>], and previous research suggests that CAHS D dimer formation is a necessary step toward gelation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>]. TFEs were then calculated based on the solvent accessible surface area of different chemical groups in monomeric vs. dimeric state (see methods). Our calculations reveal that trehalose has a negative <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="582506v2_inline5.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> with CAHS D, meaning the dimeric state is favored in the presence of this cosolute. Sucroseâs <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="582506v2_inline6.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> is close to 0, neither stabilizing nor destabilizing the dimer (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref>). In addition to these cosolutes, we wanted to explore the effect of a cosolute with a positive <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="582506v2_inline7.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> . Glycine betaine, a common stabilizing cosolute, but without known roles in tardigrade desiccation tolerance, displayed a positive <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="582506v2_inline8.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref>). Together these cosolutes span a range of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="582506v2_inline9.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> values that are expected to increase the dimer population (trehalose), have a minimal impact on dimerization (sucrose), or increase the monomer population (glycine betaine) of CAHS D [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref>]. While data for trehalose and sucrose are in line with this analysis, we next sought to determine empirically the impact of glycine betaine on CAHS D gelation.</p>

</fig>
<p>To test the effects of glycine betaine on CAHS D dimerization predicted by these TFE calculations, we first repeated our DSC and SAXS experiments in the presence of glycine betaine. Unlike trehalose and sucrose, below the proteinâs gelation threshold no increase in enthalpy of melting was observed upon the addition of glycine betaine (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C&amp;D</xref>). To probe whether glycine betaine inhibits CAHS D oligomerization, we conducted additional DSC experiments above the proteinâs gelation threshold. While trehalose and sucrose enhanced gelation of CAHS D (<xref rid="figS7" ref-type="fig">Fig. S7B-E</xref>), we observed a decrease in enthalpy of melting when glycine betaine was present at the 500:1 molar ratio, signifying inhibition of CAHS D gelation (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6E&amp;F</xref>).</p>
<p>We then performed SAXS on CAHS D at 4 mg/mL with 1000:1 molar ratios of each cosolute. The intent of using such a high molar ratio was to mimic the high concentration of cosolutes that CAHS D would experience during desiccation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>]. A non-gelling concentration of CAHS D in 1000:1 glycine betaine yielded a scattering profile similar to the protein with no cosolute indicating a lack of gelation (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6G</xref>). Meanwhile, 1000:1 sucrose and trehalose yielded scattering profiles consistent with gelation, similar to those previously reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>]. This is made especially evident by a peak at q = 0.06 Ã<sup>-1</sup>, which reports on the width of CAHS Dâs gel fibers and matches previously reported scattering profiles for gelled CAHS D [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>]. Consistent with our hypothesis that the more negative <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="582506v2_inline10.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> for trehalose will increase dimerization and subsequent gelation, we observed an increased curvature in the Guinier region indicating increased fibrillization (<xref rid="figS8" ref-type="fig">Fig. S8C&amp;D</xref>).</p>
<p>Finally, we tested the impact of glycine betaine on CAHS Dâs protective capacity. If induction of self-assembly of CAHS D is a mechanism underlying trehalose/sucrose induced synergy, then one would expect that glycine betaineâs inhibition of gelation would result in no synergy, or even have an antagonistic effect. Glycine betaine on its own is not protective to LDH during drying nor does it inhibit LDH activity (<xref rid="figS8" ref-type="fig">Fig. S8E</xref>). We found a significant antagonistic relationship between glycine betaine and CAHS D on LDH protection (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6H</xref>). Furthermore, Pearson correlation between the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="582506v2_inline11.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> of a cosolute (scaled by concentration) and its ability to induce synergy in CAHS D was statistically significant (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6I</xref>).</p>
<p>Using a similar AlphaFold2-based approach for LEA proteins and for BSA, one observes correlations between the <italic>ÎÎ</italic>G of the disorder-to-order transition and synergy (<xref rid="figS8" ref-type="fig">Fig. S8F-L</xref>). Interestingly, AlphaFold2 predictions of our LEA proteins were broadly helical, which is in contrast to our experimental characterization of these proteins in aqueous solutions. However, this is not unusual for AlphaFold2 predictions and could possibly represent a âboundâ conformation for the proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref>]. For a subset of these proteins, we see a statistically significant correlation between <italic>ÎÎ</italic>G nd synergy (<xref rid="figS8" ref-type="fig">Fig S8F-L</xref>). However, this data is purely computational. For CAHS D, we saw our predictions recapitulated in changes in the protein structure, and for LEA proteins we do not. Thus, we conclude that cosolutes do not induce synergy in our LEA proteins through a change in folding.</p>
<p>Taken together, these results suggest that the driving force for gelation in CAHS D and its ability to synergize with a given cosolute is rooted in the direct interaction between CAHS D and the prevalent cosolute. However, trying to apply this model to the LEAs tested in this work failed to yield meaningful correlates. Thus, we propose that direct interactions between cosolute and LEA proteins cannot explain the synergy observed with cosolutes. Overall, our study demonstrates that while synergy between desiccation-related IDPs and endogenous cosolutes appears to be a widespread and conserved behavior, the mechanisms underlying this synergy vary between IDP families.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we examined the interplay between IDP sequence, solution environment, ensemble, and function. To do this, we have taken advantage of the dramatic changes to the cosolute content of anhydrobiotic organisms brought on by desiccation, and compared the effects of these cosolutes between representatives from three families of desiccation-related IDPs (LEA_4, LEA_1, and CAHS proteins). For the proteins we tested empirically, we demonstrate that endogenous cosolutes enriched during desiccation enhance the protective capacity of CAHS D, full-length LEA_4, and LEA_1 proteins in an <italic>in vitro</italic> enzyme assay. Surprisingly, the functional changes were not accompanied by any detectable structural changes to the monomeric ensemble of these IDPs under the conditions tested. However, synergistic cosolutes did induce oligomerization and gelation of CAHS D. Finally, we show that in the case of CAHS D, but not LEAs, oligomerization, gelation, and protective synergy can be traced to direct interactions between cosolute and protective protein. Our results suggest that while functional synergy between the solution environment spans multiple IDP families, different mechanisms can underlie synergistic interactions for different proteins.</p>
<p>Functional synergy for the full-length proteins from different organisms mirrored the endogenous cosolute environment in that organism. In all cases, an IDP protected LDH activity more with its endogenous cosolute compared to an exogenous cosolute. These differences in synergy appear to extend across even subtle variations in cosolute use. For example, nematodes and tardigrades both accumulate trehalose during desiccation, but tardigrades accumulate orders of magnitude less [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>]. Consistent with this, both tardigrade proteins used in this study synergized with trehalose at an order of magnitude lower concentration than what was required to elicit synergy with the nematode LEA protein.</p>
<p>It is important to note that desiccation-tolerant organisms employ multiple cosolutes to counteract the effects of desiccation. The use of a single cosolute-IDP system in our <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments does not accurately mirror the diverse cosolute changes in desiccating systems. For instance, <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> seeds enrich both trehalose and sucrose, among other cosolutes. This demands the necessity of future experiments that incorporate both or multiple cosolutes and assess their synergistic effects, thus elucidating the intricate synergy in multi-cosolute systems. Additionally, we want to point out that our results cannot necessarily be generalized to all desiccation-related IDPs. More experiments will be needed to assess the relevance of cosolute effects to functional synergy and IDP folding in the context of desiccation and beyond. This remains an important future direction for the field.</p>
<p>Overall, while our study found that synergy with endogenous cosolutes is observed across two families of LEA proteins as well as CAHS proteins, we observed a major difference in structural changes induced in these protein families. While in CAHS D synergy could be traced back to the interaction between the protective protein and the cosolute, no underlying mechanism was detected for the tested LEAs. What then could be driving the synergy we observe for these proteins?</p>
<p>One possibility is that in most of our assays we do not consider the protein being protected. Our studies of molecular mechanisms for synergy do not consider the underlying effect of both protectant protein and cosolute on LDH directly. It is possible that the presence of both endogenous cosolute and protein create a solvation environment that becomes highly protective for e.g. rehydration. In line with this, recent studies have highlighted the ability of LEA proteins to stabilize sugar glasses in a dry state [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">73</xref>]. Glass formation is known to preserve labile biomolecules during desiccation, contributing to survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">74</xref>]. Different glasses vary significantly in their protective capacity, and studies have attempted to find structural properties that explain this difference [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">73</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">75</xref>]. Because trehalose and sucrose both form glasses when dried [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">76</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">77</xref>], it is possible that our LEA proteins are inducing a change in the glassâs structural properties that leads to synergy.</p>
<p>Another possibility is a difference in the nature of TFE-induced oligomerization. While repulsive cosolutes drive homotypic interactions between CAHS D monomers, the same thermodynamic force can promote heterotypic interactions between LEAs and other proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">78</xref>]. For example, trehalose may stabilize electrostatic interactions between LEA proteins and LDH during our <italic>in vitro</italic> synergy assays. If the protective capacity of LEA proteins is dependent on direct interactions between the protectant and the client protein, then this is a plausible explanation for synergy. However, it is currently unknown whether or not this is the case.</p>
<p>Another major question posed by this research is why sucrose was able to elicit synergy in CAHS D. Our computational approach predicted that sucrose should be agnostic to CAHS Dâs ability to form dimers, and yet we clearly see that, <italic>in vitro</italic>, sucrose is a moderately potent driver of gelation. We believe several factors could explain this effect. While sucrose does not drive dimerization through direct âsoftâ repulsion, it may still do so by acting as a crowder eliciting an excluded volume effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">79</xref>]. Another possible manifestation of an excluded volume effect is the slight increase in the melting peak that is observed with all cosolutes used in this study at high molar ratios (<xref rid="figS7" ref-type="fig">Fig. S7F-I</xref>, <xref rid="figS8" ref-type="fig">Fig. S8M-N</xref>). Alternatively, given that CAHS D must polymerize beyond the dimeric state to form a gel, sucrose may stabilize a higher-level oligomer that was not captured in our <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="582506v2_inline12.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> analysis.</p>
<p>IDPs are known to play important regulatory functions during development and disease progression that often occurs together with changes to the chemical composition of the intracellular environment. For example, there are known links between type II diabetes and Alzhiemerâs disease, and it has been shown that the intrinsically disordered neurodegenerative peptide AÎ²42 undergoes pathological oligomerization in the presence of glucose whose levels mirror those found in diabetic patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>]. Our study showcases how different cosolute environments can have a direct effect on the function of IDPs. By understanding the rules governing desiccation related IDP-cosolute interactions, we might better understand the influence of changing chemical environments on a host of other IDPs.</p>

<p>Expression constructs were transformed into BL21 (DE3) cells (New England Biosciences, Cat. #C2527H) and plated on Luria-Bertani (LB) agar plates with 50 Î¼g/mL kanamycin. At least 3 single colonies were chosen for each construct and tested for expression. Constructs were expressed in 1 L LB/kanamycin medium and grown at 37 Â°C while shaking at 180 rpm (Eppendorf Innova S44i) until an OD600 of 0.6 was reached. The culture was induced with 1 mM IPTG, and grown for the next 4 hours while shaking. AvLEA1C was grown for 1 hour following IPTG addition. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4000 rpm for 30 minutes at 4 Â°C. Cell pellets were resuspended in 5 mL of 20 mM Tris buffer, pH 7.5 supplemented with 30 Î¼L of 1X protease inhibitor [Sigma Aldrich, Cat. P2714]). Cell pellets were stored at -â0 Â°C until further use.</p>

<title>Protein Purification</title>
<p>Frozen pellets were thawed at room temperature, subjected to heat lysis in boiling water for 10 minutes, and cooled down for 15 minutes. These were then centrifuged at 10500 rpm at 10 Â°C for 30 minutes, and the supernatant was later filter-sterilized through a 0.22 Î¼m filter to remove any insoluble particles (EZFlow Syringe Filter, Cat. 388-3416-OEM). The filtrate was diluted two times the volume with buffer UA (8 M urea [Acros Organics, CAS No. 57-13-6], 50 mM sodium acetate [Tocris CAS No. 127-09-3], pH 4). This was loaded onto a HiPrep SP HP 16/10 (Cytiva, Cat. 29018183) cation exchange column and purified on an AKTA Pure (Cytiva, Cat. #29018224), controlled using the UNICORN 7-9.1 Workstation pure-BP-exp (Cytiva, Cat. #29128116). CAHS D was eluted using a 0-40% UB (8 M urea, 50 mM sodium acetate, and 1 M NaCl, pH 4) gradient and fractionated over 15 column volumes. LEA proteins were eluted using the 0-70% UB gradient over 15 column volumes. Protein fractions were assessed using SDS-PAGE and selected fractions were dialysed in a 3.5 kDa tubing (SpectraPor 3 Dialysis Membrane, Part No. 132724) in 20 mM sodium phosphate buffer pH 7, followed by six rounds of Milli-Q water (18.2 Mâ¦cm) at four hours interval each. Concentration of the dialyzed fractions were then quantified using Qubit 4 fluorometer (Invitrogen, REF Q33226), flash frozen, then lyophilized (Labconco FreeZone 6, Cat. 7752021) for 48 hours, and stored at â20 Â°C until further use.</p>

Protectants were resuspended at a final concentration range 20 mg/mL to 0.01 mg/mL in 25 mM Tris HCl pH 7. Rabbit muscle L-lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), sourced from Sigma (Sigma-Aldrich, Cat 10127230001), was added to each solution at a concentration of 0.1 mg/mL. Half of this sample was dried in a vacuum desiccator (SAVANT Speed Vac Concentrator) for 16 hours, while the other half was refrigerated at 4 Â°C for the same duration. Water was added to both desiccated and non-desiccated samples to a final volume of 250 Î¼L each. 10 Î¼L sample was mixed with 980 Î¼L phosphate pyruvate buffer (100 mM sodium phosphate, 2 mM sodium pyruvate; pH 6.00) supplemented with 10 Î¼L of 10 mM NADH (Sigma-Aldrich NADH; disodium salt, grade II) in a quartz cuvette. LDH activity was measured as the kinetics of the decrease in NADH absorption at 340 nm for a minute in NanodropOne (Thermo Scientific). Percent protection was calculated as a ratio of NADH absorbance for the desiccated samples normalized to non-desiccated controls. Each sample was performed in triplicate.</p>

<p>The protection data for individual protein or motif was used to select a suboptimal protective concentration. Trehalose or sucrose was mixed in equal parts with proteins at 2X concentration in 100 Î¼L resuspension buffer (25 mM Tris HCl pH 7) at respective molar ratios. LDH assay was performed for the mixtures as described previously. For each mixture, LDH protection was assessed individually and as a mixture. The sum of the protection conferred by individual protein and cosolute was determined, which would refer to the expected additive protection.

<title>Circular Dichroism (CD) Spectroscopy</title>
<p>CD spectroscopy was adopted from Bremer et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>]. Lyophilized proteins were resuspended in 25 mM NaPi pH 7 to a concentration of 200 Î¼M. The resuspended protein was then mixed in equal parts with the NaPi buffer, 20 mM trehalose, or 20 mM sucrose in separate samples to a 100:1 molar ratio, with a final protein concentration of 100 Î¼M and cosolute concentration of 10 mM. Protein concentration was confirmed with either a UV-vis (Thermo Scientific, GENESYS 50 UV-visible spectrophotometer) or a Qubit (Life Technologies, Qubit 3.0 Fluorometer). 20 Î¼L aliquots of the samples were deposited on a 0.05 mm quartz cuvette and measured in a Circular Dichroism (CD) spectrometer (JASCO, J-1500 model). New 20 Î¼L aliquots were then deposited on one half of a 0.05 mm quartz cuvette and spread across part of the cuvette with the tip of a pipette, to a surface area of about 1 cm<sup>2</sup>. The samples were then desiccated in a vacuum chamber with drierite for 1 hour to create a dry film, and another CD measurement was taken immediately after the vacuum was stopped. Each measurement was performed in triplicate.</p>

<title>Small-Angle X-ray Scattering (SAXS) â Sample Preparation</title>
<p>Lyophilized protein was resuspended at high concentration in a buffer containing 20 mM tris HCl (pH = 7.0) and the correct amount of cosolute to reach the desired molar ratio. Protein samples were then quantified with the Qubit Protein Assay from ThermoFisher Scientific (catalog# Q33212). The proteins were then diluted into 8 mg/mL and 4 mg/mL stocks using the same cosolute solution. Due to the necessity for each sample to have an identical buffer blank, the concentration of cosolute in the 8 mg/mL sample had to be the same as in the 4 mg/mL sample, meaning the molar ratio would be doubled in the 4 mg/mL sample. For each sample, a small aliquot of buffer was saved and stored at 4 Â°C for use as a blank. Samples and buffer blanks were filtered using 0.22 Î¼m syringe filters and loaded into an Axygen 96-well polypropylene PCR Microplate (Corning product# PCR-96-FS-C), which was then sealed with an AxyMat Sealing Mat (product# AM-96-PCR-RD) and wrapped in parafilm. Plates were shipped to Lawrence Berkeley National Labs in a styrofoam cooler filled with cold packs. All SAXS measurements were performed by the SIBYLS group at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory HT-SAXS beamline (12.3.1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">80</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">81</xref>]. For technical restrictions, proteins were measured at 20:1 and 200:1 molar ratios of trehalose and sucrose instead of 10:1 and 100:1. The exception to this was CAHS D, which was tested with a wider range of molar ratios (1.6:1, 16:1, and 160:1).</p>
<p>We note that the radius of gyration that we calculated for CAHS D is approximately 5 angstroms greater than previously reported by our group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>]. We believe that this difference can be attributed to minor differences in our approach. While we used Size Exclusion Chromatography (SEC)-coupled SAXS and a relatively dilute CAHS D sample in our previous study, the number of SAXS experiments in this study necessitated a higher-throughput approach that omitted the SEC step. We therefore believe that our control samples contained a higher fraction of transient oligomeric species, which inflated the radius of gyration without significantly curving the Guinier region. Given that this fact was consistent between all of our CAHS D samples, the inter-environmental comparisons are still valid.</p>

<title>Small-Angle X-ray Scattering (SAXS) â Guinier and pMW Analysis</title>
<p>Notable aggregation, likely induced by exposure to X-rays, was present in some samples, especially in solutions that contained cosolutes. This was controlled for by excluding scattering data from samples that had already been exposed to large amounts of X-ray radiation and were thus statistically different from the initial readings. Despite some readings having been excluded, a Guinier analysis was able to be conducted for each protein:cosolute combination. Buffer subtractions and Guinier analysis were performed using BioXTAS RAW v. 2.1.4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">82</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">83</xref>].

<p>PICUP crosslinking was performed as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref>]. Briefly, lyophilized protein, Ru(II)bpy32+, and ammonium persulfate were resuspended in 20 mM Tris pH 7.5. Each reaction mixture constituted protein at the desired concentration with 1.25 mM Tris (2,2â-bipyridyl)dichlororuthenium(II)hexahydrate (Sigma, CAS No. 50525-27-4, and 2.5 mM ammonium persulfate (Sigma, CAS No. 7727-54-0) to a final volume of 10 Î¼L. For mixtures, cosolutes and proteins were mixed at a 100:1 molar ratio at 2X molar concentration. Photoreaction was triggered by flashing 72 W light through a 2.5 cm water filter for 10 seconds in a dark room. The reaction was immediately quenched by adding 10 Î¼L of 2X Laemmli buffer containing 4 % SDS and 10 % Î²-mercaptoethanol. The reaction mixture was heated at 95 Â°C for 5 minutes. 8.5 Î¼L of each sample was run in denaturing SDS-PAGE gels and stained with coomassie blue to visualize the oligomeric states.</p>

The sample mass was determined after the sample was sealed within the pan and lid. The sealed samples were then run on a TA DSC2500 instrument. The DSC method for heating experiments is as follows:</p>
<p>Samples were equilibrated at 20 Â°C, heated to 60 Â°C at a 5 Â°C per minute ramp, and then cooled to 20 Â°C at a 5 Â°C per minute ramp. Samples were held for a 10 minute isothermal hold at 20 Â°C and heated to 60 Â°C at a 5 Â°C per minute ramp. Trios software (TRIOS version #5.0.0.44608, TA Instruments) was used to analyze enthalpy for samples showing the melt curves.

<title>Transfer Free Energy (TFE) Calculations</title>
<p>TFE values of each cosolute for each amino acid were pulled from existing literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">87</xref>]. We used experimentally derived TFE values for the transfer of a chemical group - amino acid side chains or backbone - into 1 M solutions of trehalose, sucrose, or glycine betaine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref>]. We then calculated the TFE for each conformation using the formula:
<disp-formula>
<graphic xlink:href="582506v2_ueqn8.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula>
Here, <italic>ÎG<sub>tr</sub></italic> is the TFE of a protein conformation from water to 1 M cosolute solution, <italic>N</italic> is the chemical group, <italic>i</italic> is a numerical index for all instances of the chemical group, <italic>Î±</italic> is the surface area of the specific instance of the chemical group in square angstrom, and <italic>g</italic> is the experimental value of the transfer free energy for that chemical group per square angstrom of exposed surface area [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref>]. By doing this for two conformations of a protein, one can find the change in free energy of conformational change that can be attributed to the presence of an osmolyte.</p>
<p>Importantly, two âend-stateâ protein conformations are required to calculate a <italic>ÎÎG<sub>tr</sub></italic> value, which is typically done for well-folded proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref>]. However, we believe the proteins used in this study constitute an important exception. For CAHS, several different groups have noted the propensity of CAHS proteins for oligomerization, and recent research has identified the dimer as a particularly stable CAHS D conformer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>]. This notion is supported by the crosslinking data, in which the CAHS D dimer is especially prominent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>]. We thus use the following equation for the effects of cosolutes on CAHS dimerization:
<disp-formula>
<graphic xlink:href="582506v2_ueqn9.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>

The monomer and dimer conformations were obtained from AlphaFold2 Multimer and AlphaFold2 predictions, respectively (see AlphaFold2 method). Surface area for residues was calculated using SOURSOP, a python package for protein structure analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">88</xref>].</p>
<p>To calculate the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="582506v2_inline15.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> for our LEA proteins and for BSA, we compared an AlphaFold2 prediction of a monomeric protein with a theoretical conformation in which all residues are 100% exposed. This is because (a) LEAs showed no tendency to form a gel, and (b) the CD spectra switched between a primarily disordered conformation to a helical conformation upon desiccation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). For all LEAs, we calculated:
<disp-formula>
<graphic xlink:href="582506v2_ueqn10.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula>
Here, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="582506v2_inline16.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> represents the free energy of a completely denatured protein chain where the maximum theoretical accessibility is achieved (RASA = 1). <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="582506v2_inline17.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> represents the free energy of the proteinâs ânativeâ conformation (as determined by an AlphaFold2 prediction).

<p>This <bold>important</bold> study investigates the sensitivity to endogenous cosolvents of three families of intrinsically disordered proteins involved with desiccation. The findings, drawn from well-designed experiments and calculations, suggest a functional synergy between sensitivity to small molecule solutes and convergent desiccation protection strategy. The evidence is found to be <bold>convincing</bold>, and the authors provide appropriate caveats since the study's conclusions are based on a small number of proteins. This work will be of interest to biochemists and biophysicists interested in the conformation-function relationship of intrinsically disordered proteins.</p>

<p>The individual roles of both cosolvents and intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) in desiccation have been well established, but few studies have tried to elucidate how these two factors may contribute synergistically. The authors quantify the synergy for the model and true IDPs involved with desiccation and find that only the true IDPs have strong desiccation tolerance and synergy with cosolvents. Using these as model systems, they quantify the local (secondary structure vis-a-vi CD spectroscopy) and global dimensions (vis-a-vi the Rg of SAXS experiments) and find no obvious changes with the co-solvents. Instead, they focus on the gelation of one of the IDPs and, using theory and experiments, suggest that the co-solvents may enable desiccation tolerance, an interesting hypothesis to guide future in vivo desiccation studies. A few minor points that remained unclear to this reviewer and that were noted previously have been reasonably addressed in this revision.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This paper is quite extensive and has significant strengths worth highlighting. Notably, the number and type of methods employed to study IDPs are quite unusual, employing CD spectroscopy, SAXS measurements, and DSC. The use of the TFE is an exciting integration of the physical chemistry of cosolvents into the desiccation field is a nice approach and a clever way of addressing the gap of the lack of conformational changes depending on the cosolvents. Furthermore, I think this is a major point and strength of the paper; the underlying synergy of cosolvents and IDPs may lie in the thermodynamics of the dehydration process.</p>
<p>Figure S6A is very useful. I encourage readers who are confused about the DSC analysis, interpretation, and calculation to refer to it.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>All minor weaknesses were addressed in this revision.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The paper aims to investigate the synergies between desiccation chaperones and small molecule cosolutes, and describe its mechanistic basis. The paper reports that IDP chaperones have stronger synergies with the cosolutes they coexist with, and in one case suggests that this is related to oligomerization propensity of the IDP.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors have done a good job improving the paper. The study uses a lot of orthogonal methods and the experiments are technically well done. They are addressing a new question that has not really been addressed previously.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The conclusions are still based on a few examples and only partial correlations. However, this is now acknowledged by the authors and the conclusions are presented with appropriate caveats.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The individual roles of both cosolvents and intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) in desiccation have been well established, but few studies have tried to elucidate how these two factors may contribute synergistically. The authors quantify the synergy for the model and true IDPs involved with desiccation and find that only the true IDPs have strong desiccation tolerance and synergy with cosolvents. Using these as model systems, they quantify the local (secondary structure vis-a-vi CD spectroscopy) and global dimensions (vis-a-vi the Rg of SAXS experiments) and find no obvious changes with the co-solvents. Instead, they focus on the gelation of one of the IDPs and, using theory and experiments, suggest that the co-solvents may enable desiccation tolerance, an interesting hypothesis to guide future in vivo desiccation studies. A few minor points that remain unclear to this reviewer are noted.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This paper is quite extensive and has significant strengths worth highlighting. Notably, the number and type of methods employed to study IDPs are quite unusual, employing CD spectroscopy, SAXS measurements, and DSC. The use of the TFE is an exciting integration of the physical chemistry of cosolvents into the desiccation field is a nice approach and a clever way of addressing the gap of the lack of conformational changes depending on the cosolvents. Furthermore, I think this is a major point and strength of the paper; the underlying synergy of cosolvents and IDPs may lie in the thermodynamics of the dehydration process.</p>
<p>Figure S6A is very useful. I encourage readers who are confused about the DSC analysis, interpretation, and calculation to refer to it.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Overall, the paper is sound and employs strong experimental design and analysis. However, I wish to point out a few minor weaknesses.</p>
<p>Perhaps the largest, in terms of reader comprehension, focuses on the transition between the model peptides and real IDPs in Figures 1 and 2. Notably, little is discussed with respect to the structure of the IDPs and what is known. Notably, I was confused to find out when looking at Table 1 that many of the IDPs are predicted to be largely unordered, which seemed to contrast with some of the CD spectroscopy data. I wonder if the disorder plots are misleading for readers. Can the authors comment more on this confusion? What are these IDPs structurally?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We apologize for the confusion caused here and thank the reviewer for this astute observation. Our CD spectroscopy data suggests all LEA proteins are almost entirely disordered under aqueous conditions, with a single major minimum at 200 nm, although most have a small inflection around 220 nm, indicating a small proportion of helicity (Fig. 3A). The notable exception here is CAHS D, which â in line with our work and the work of many others â possesses a substantial degree of transient helicity in the linker region (residues 100-200), giving rise to a more pronounced minimum at 220 nm. These conclusions are consistent with our SAXS data (Fig. 4), which predict a radius of gyration far larger than a globular folded protein of the same number of residues should have (15-20 Ã). The structural predictions (both Metapredict and AlphaFold2), however, imply several of the proteins to be ordered; AvLEA1C and HeLEA68614 are both predicted to have large folded regions based on metapredict disorder scores. We believe this is an erroneous prediction driven by these regions' propensity to acquire helicity in the context of desiccation (Fig 3B) and/or when interacting with clients. As such, our computational analysis is at odds with the experimental data because these proteins are all poised to undergo a coil-to-helix transition, an effect our parallel work has proposed is important for their function (see Biswas et al. Prot. Sci. 2024). The ability of AlphaFold2 to predict bound-state or transient helices has been previously documented (Alderson et al PNAS 2023)</p>
<p>To address this discrepancy, the caption for Table 1 reads: âWe note that the reason many of these profiles contain large folded regions is because the amphipathic LEA and CAHS proteins are predicted to form helices, which metapredict infers and incorrectly highlights these regions as âfoldedâ when really they are disordered in isolationâ. We have also added additional context and information to the caption for Fig. S9 âWe note that the structural predictions from AlphaFold2 contain largely ordered structures. We believe this is due to the propensity of these proteins to form helices in the context of drying or when interacting with a client. This has been shown in cases where an IDR contains residual helicity or is folded upon binding [70].â</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Related to the above thoughts, the alpha fold structures for the LEA proteins are predicted (unconfidently) as being alpha-helical in contrast to the CD data. Does this complicate the TFE studies and eliminate the correlation for the LEA proteins?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>AlphaFold2 predicted helicity in disordered regions is commonly observed, and thought to indicate a possible âboundâ helical state (Alderson et al. PNAS 2023). As shown by the CD data, in aqueous conditions no secondary structure exists. It is only in the desiccated state - the path to which requires proteins to reach excessively high concentrations - that this secondary structure appears. Underlying our TFE model is that the AlphaFold2 predicted secondary structure is indicative of the state the proteins are in at high abundance, which occurs as cells ramp up protectant expression and as water is removed from the system. Under these assumptions, the CD data is in agreement with the AlphaFold2 predictions, and our analysis holds. This is explained in the methods under âTransfer Free Energy (TFE) Calculationsâ - but we have now also added an additional sentence to this effect in the main text: âUsing a similar AlphaFold2-based approach for LEA proteins and for BSA, we can make correlations between the Gtr of the disorder-to-order transition and synergy (Fig. S8F-K). Interestingly, AlphaFold2 predictions of our LEA proteins were broadly helical, which is in contrast to our experimental characterization of these proteins in aqueous solutions. However, this is not unusual for AlphaFold2 predictions and could possibly represent a âboundâ conformation for the proteins [70].â</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Additionally, the notation that the LEA and BSA proteins do not correlate is unclear to this reviewer, aren't many of the correlations significant, having both a large R^2 and significant p-value?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for pointing this out. While BSA and some LEA proteins have <inline-formula id="sa3equ1"><inline-graphic xlink:href="elife-97231-sa3-equ1.jpg" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="jpeg"/></inline-formula> values that correlate with synergy, thereâs more to consider in assessing the relevance of these correlations. For example, we cannot claim that the <inline-formula id="sa3equ2"><inline-graphic xlink:href="elife-97231-sa3-equ2.jpg" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="jpeg"/></inline-formula> value is physiologically relevant without observing an actual structural change in the protein. Furthermore, several of these proteins (BSA and AvLEA1C) were found to be not significantly synergistic in the LDH assay, and any correlation should, therefore, also be considered non-significant. We have added a sentence to the results to clarify this: âFor a subset of these proteins, we see a statistically significant correlation between G and synergy. However, this data is purely computational. For CAHS D, we saw our predictions recapitulated in changes in the protein structure, and for the LEA proteins we do not. Thus, we conclude that cosolutes do not induce synergy in our LEA proteins through a change in folding.â</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The calculation of synergy seems too simplistic or even problematic to me. While I am not familiar with the standards in the desiccation field, I think the approach as presented may be problematic due to the potential for higher initial values of protection to have lower synergies (two 50%s for example, could not yield higher than 100%).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We acknowledge the reviewerâs concern about our synergy calculation. We would like to highlight the use of sub-optimal protective concentrations in our synergy assays similar to studies previously reported in the desiccation field (Nguyen et al. 2022; Kim et al. 2018).</p>
<p>As the reviewer pointed out, we agree that there is a theoretical 100% threshold in our experiments which if we hit, we cannot distinguish between individual additive vs synergistic effects. To avoid the situation of reaching the near maximal protection levels (~100%), we intentionally select a sub-optimal concentration of the protectants that are below the maximum efficacy level for individual protectants to use in our assays. This limits the potential for initial higher values of the protectants so that their combined effect is not maximized, and there is always the potential for synergy. We would also like to point out that we never actually hit that 100% threshold in any of our synergy experiments, which warrants that any observed increase in protection is attributed to a true synergistic effect between the protectants.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Instead, I would think one would need to really think of it as an apparent equilibrium constant between functional and non-functional LDH (Kapp = [Func]/[Not Func] and frac = Kapp/(1+Kapp) or Kapp = frac/(1-frac) ) Then after getting the apparent equilibrium constants for the IDP and cosolvent (KappIDP and KappCS), the expected additive effect would be frac = (KappIDP+KappCS)/(1+KappIDP+KappCS).</p>
<p>Consequently, the extent of synergy could be instead calculated as KappBOTH-KappIDP-KappCS. Maybe this reviewer is misunderstanding. It is recommended that the authors clarify why the synergy calculation in the manuscript is reasonable.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. In the desiccation field, the synergy calculations that we used is the standard method that people use, so thatâs what we present in our main manuscript. However, we have now quantified synergy through two new approaches: one, as suggested by the reviewer, using the equilibrium constant (Kapp) as a metric, and the other using the Bliss Independent model, which is a common approach for calculating synergy in drug combination studies. We see minimal differences in terms of the synergy scores using these different methods. We have included the results for these additional methods in supplemental figure S3.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Related to the above, the authors should discuss the utility of using molar concentration instead of volume fraction or mass concentration. Notably, when trehalose is used in concentration, the volume fraction of trehalose is much smaller compared to the IDPs used in Figure 2 or some in Figure 1. Would switching to a different weighted unit impact the results of the study, or is it robust to such (potentially) arbitrary units?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for this comment. Indeed, in studies of cosolute effect, concentration units can alter the conclusions of the study (Auton and Bolen 2004). In our case, the relevant figures where we use a concentration scale (1B and 2B) are not germane to the main conclusions: The only use of these PD50 values is to determine a sub-optimal concentration at which ~30% of the LDH is protected. While it is true that the number for the concentration of e.g., trehalose will be dramatically different if we were to use mass fraction units, the rest of the work and all our conclusions would be exactly the same.</p>
<p>Additionally, our use of a molar ratio when discussing synergy is a direct result of the way we think about such synergy: Since the concentration of both protein and cosolute can change by orders of magnitude during drying, it is the copy numbers of both proteins and cosolute that are conserved in this process, and it is this unit that we think is important to the protective effect (rather than the partial molar volume, for example, which would be changing as the system dries).</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The paper aims to investigate the synergies between desiccation chaperones and small molecule cosolutes, and describe its mechanistic basis. The paper reports that IDP chaperones have stronger synergies with the cosolutes they coexist with, and in one case suggests that this is related to oligomerization propensity of the IDP.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The study uses a lot of orthogonal methods and the experiments are technically well done. They are addressing a new question that has not really been addressed previously.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The conclusions are based on a few examples and only partial correlations. While the data support mechanistic conclusions about the individual proteins studied, it is not clear that the conclusions can be generalized to the extent proposed by the authors due to small effect sizes, small numbers of proteins, and only partial correlations.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for bringing this up. We agree that we should not generalize our results to other systems based on the evidence we have for the proteins used in our study. We have altered our discussion to highlight that this may apply to other IDPs, and that future experiments must be done to support this: âAdditionally, we want to point out that our results cannot necessarily be generalized to all desiccation-related IDPs. More experiments will be needed to assess the relevance of cosolute effects to functional synergy and IDP folding in the context of desiccation and beyond. This remains an important future direction for the field.â</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The authors pose relevant questions and try to answer them through a systematic series of experiments that are all technically well-conducted. The data points are generally interpreted appropriately in isolation, however, I am a little concerned about a tendency to over-generalize their findings. Many of the experiments give negative or non-conclusive results (not a problem in itself), which means that the overall storyline is often based on single examples.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the reviewerâs point. As mentioned earlier, we have modified our manuscript to reflect that our findings are based on the six proteins that we studied, and we can only speculate about other desiccation-related IDPs based on our results.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>For example, the central conclusion that IDPs interact synergistically with their endogenous co-solute (Figure 2E) is largely driven by one outlier from Arabidopsis. The rest are relatively close to the diagonal, and one could equally well suggest that the cosolutes affect the IDPs equally (which is also the conclusion in 1F).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the reviewerâs concern regarding our conclusion in Figures 2E and 1F. We would like to highlight that our conclusions that IDPs interact synergistically with their endogenous cosolute are based on statistical analysis. Our data shows that full-length proteins that were synergistic with both cosolutes are always significantly more synergistic with the endogenous cosolute (Fig. 2E, Fig. S2C-E). For example, the nematode protein is synergistic with both trehalose and sucrose, but is significantly more synergistic with trehalose, the endogenous nematode cosolute, than with sucrose (Fig S2D).</p>
<p>This is not the case in 1F. In Fig. 1F, it is to note that not only are the points close to the diagonal, but most points are close to zero along both axes indicating no synergy. In fact, many points have negative synergy (antagonistic effect).</p>
<p>We do recognize that our conclusions are based on the study of a specific set of six IDPs, and we do not want to overreach in our conclusions. To acknowledge this, we have now added text to emphasize that our conclusion is based on the six proteins that we tested, and we speculate it might apply to other systems: âOur data shows that these six IDPs synergize best with their endogenous cosolute to promote desiccation tolerance and we speculate that this may apply to other desiccation-related IDPsâ.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Similarly, the mechanistic explanations tend to be based on single examples. This is somewhat unavoidable as biophysical studies cannot be done on thousands of proteins, but the text should be toned down to reflect the strength of the conclusions.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We acknowledge the reviewerâs concern. We have modified our manuscript accordingly to reflect that the mechanistic insights we gained are for the six proteins we tested empirically. These changes can be found throughout the manuscript. None of our experiments rule out the possibility that other LEA proteins or CAHS proteins may show different structural transitions, or that other IDPs may take on structural changes in response to the cosolutes.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The central hypothesis revolves around the interplay between cosolutes and IDP chaperones comparing chaperones from species with different complements of cosolutes. In Table 1, it is mentioned that Arabidopsis uses both trehalose and sucrose as a cosolute, yet experiments are only done with either of these cosolutes and Arabidopsis is counted in the sucrose column. While it makes sense to compare them separately from a biophysical point of view, the ability to test the co-evolution of these systems is somewhat diminished by this. At least it should be discussed clearly.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the reviewerâs comment. As is mentioned in Table 1, <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> uses both trehalose and sucrose as cosolute. As such, we would predict that the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> proteins would respond positively to both cosolutes. We would like to point out that <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> is counted in both trehalose and sucrose columns.</p>
<p>We would also like to emphasize that multiple osmolytes exist in all organisms as a desiccation response and a simple IDP-cosolute system is far from a true recapitulation of a desiccating system. We have touched on this in the discussion and explicitly addressed the presence of both cosolutes in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and the need for further experiments to test for synergistic interactions using both or multiple mediators to illustrate synergy in multiple cosolute systems: âIt is important to note that desiccation-tolerant organisms employ multiple cosolutes to counteract the effects of desiccation. The use of a single cosolute-IDP system in our <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments does not accurately mirror the diverse cosolute changes in desiccating systems. For instance, <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> seeds enrich both trehalose and sucrose, among other cosolutes. This demands the necessity of future experiments that incorporate both or multiple cosolutes and assess their synergistic effects, thus elucidating the intricate synergy in multi-cosolute systems.â</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>It would be helpful if the authors could spell out the theoretical basis of how they quantify synergy. I understand what they are doing - and maybe there are no better ways to do it - but it seems like an approach with limitations. The authors identify one in that the calculation only works far from 100%, but to me, it seems there would be an equally strict requirement to be significantly above 0%. This would suggest that it is used wrongly in Figure 6H, where there is no effect of betaine (at least as far as the color scheme allows one to distinguish the different bars). In this case, the authors cannot really conclude synergy or not, it could be a straight non-synergistic inhibition by betaine.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the reviewerâs concern about the theoretical basis of how we quantify synergy. We do acknowledge the limitation of our LDH protection/synergy assay only produces interpretable data when our protectant/mixture yields protection levels within the range 0 and below 100%. Betaine was not protective in any of the concentrations we tested in this study. In line with the reviewerâs comment, we also acknowledge that within our experimental procedures, the inhibitory effects of betaine cannot be accurately captured, considering that LDH activity is ~0% without protectants. However, in our positive control in which LDH is co-incubated with betaine or betaine and CAHS D overnight in the hydrated state, we do not see a loss of enzymatic function of LDH nullifying a direct inhibition by betaine. We have added this text in our manuscript: âGlycine betaine on its own is not protective to LDH during drying nor does it inhibit LDH activity (Fig. S8E)â.</p>

<p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>The conclusion in lines 195-196 seems overstated as the length dependence could be strongly changed in non-tested concentrations or those that are not possible experimentally. Notably, the IDPs in Figure 2 are around 200AA and only transition in the ranges tested for these peptides. Some other conclusions around this point seem a little overstated.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We acknowledge the reviewerâs concern about the potential variability of the length dependence of the motifs at concentrations beyond those tested. However, we would like to highlight that higher concentrations of the tandem repeats (At22 and At44) inactivated LDH during the incubation period, as was seen with  the 11-mer motifs. This meant we could not evaluate protection by these motifs at concentrations beyond those plotted in Fig. 1A. This behavior was not observed for the full-length proteins. Regardless, we have toned down the conclusion in lines 195-196 to only reflect our results for the 2X and 4X repeats of At11 which now reads âWe synthesized 2X (At22) and 4X (At44) tandem repeats of the <italic>A. thaliana</italic> 11-mer LEA_4 motif (At11). At22 and At44 show minimal potency in preserving <italic>in vitro</italic> LDH function during drying (Fig. 1A, Fig. S1A).â</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>Figure 3: The focus on the ratio 222/210 seems inappropriate. That would indeed be useful for telling apart e.g. an alpha-to-beta transition, or formation of coiled coils. However, for a helix-to-coil equilibrium, which is likely to dominate here, it will not be especially sensitive as demonstrated e.g. by BSA in the dry state.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for this comment. The use of ratios to measure structural transition is primarily to eliminate the effects of concentrations on the graph. It is clear from Fig. 3A and Fig. 3B that a structural transition occurs between the aqueous and the desiccated state. This is also very clear from the 222/210 ratio that we use (Fig. 3C), for every construct other than BSA - which indeed does not seem to undergo a dramatic structural change in the desiccated state. We have clarified this now in the description of the results: âUsing this metric, all LEAs and CAHS D display a clear increase in helical propensity upon being desiccated (Fig. 3C). On the other hand, the helical propensity of BSA remains very similar to its hydrated state, indicating that no dramatic structural change took place (Fig. 3C).</p>
