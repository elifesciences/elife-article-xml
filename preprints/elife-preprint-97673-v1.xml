<title>Abstract</title><p>In the mammalian neocortex, inhibition is important for dynamically balancing excitation and shaping the response properties of cells and circuits. The various functions of inhibition are thought to be mediated by different inhibitory neuron types of which a large diversity exists in several species. Current understanding of the function and connectivity of distinct inhibitory neuron types has mainly derived from studies in transgenic mice. However, it is unknown whether knowledge gained from mouse studies applies to the primate, the model system closest to humans. The lack of viral tools to selectively access inhibitory neuron types has been a major impediment to studying their function in the primate. Here, we have thoroughly validated and characterized several recently-developed viral vectors designed to restrict transgene expression to GABAergic cells or their parvalbumin (PV) subtype, and identified two types that show high specificity and efficiency in marmoset V1. We show that in marmoset V1 AAV-h56D induces transgene expression in GABAergic cells with up to 91-94% specificity and 80% efficiency, depending on viral serotype and cortical layer. AAV-PHP.eB-S5E2 induces transgene expression in PV cells across all cortical layers with up to 98% specificity and 86-90% efficiency. Thus, these viral vectors represent promising tools for studying GABA and PV cell function and connectivity in the primate cortex.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The computations performed by the neocortex result from the activity of neural circuits composed of glutamatergic excitatory and GABAergic inhibitory neurons. Although representing only 15-30% of all cortical neurons, inhibitory neurons profoundly influence cortical computations and cortical dynamics. For example, they influence how excitatory neurons integrate information, shape neuronal tuning properties, modulate neuronal responses based on sensory context and behavioral state, and maintain an appropriate dynamic range of cortical excitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Ferster and Miller, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Shapley et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Tremblay et al., 2016</xref>). These various functions of inhibition are thought to be mediated by different inhibitory neuron types, of which a large diversity has been identified in several species, each having distinct chemical, electrophysiological and morphological properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Ascoli et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Burkhalter, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Kubota et al., 2016</xref>).</p>
<p>In mouse cortex, the expression of specific molecular markers identifies three major, largely non-overlapping classes of inhibitory neurons: parvalbumin-(PV), somatostatin-(SOM), and serotonin receptor (5HT3aR)-expressing neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Xu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Rudy et al., 2011</xref>). The creation of mouse lines selectively expressing Cre-recombinase in specific inhibitory neuron classes has led to a multitude of studies on the connectivity and function of each class (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Tremblay et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Wood et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Shin and Adesnik, 2023</xref>). Distinct patterns of connectivity and function specific to each inhibitory neuron class are emerging from these mouse studies, but it remains unknown whether insights gained from mouse apply to inhibitory neurons in higher species such as primates. Understanding cortical inhibitory neuron function in the primate is critical for understanding cortical function and dysfunction in the model system closest to humans.</p>
<p>A major impediment to studying inhibitory neuron function in primates has been the lack of tools for cell-type specific expression of transgenes in this species. However, recent advances in the application to primates of cell-type specific viral technology are beginning to enable studies of inhibitory neuron types in primate cortex. In particular, two recent studies have developed recombinant adeno-associated viral vectors (AAV) that restrict gene expression to GABAergic neurons under the <italic>mDlx</italic> enhancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Dimidschstein et al., 2016</xref>) or <italic>h56D</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Mehta et al., 2019</xref>) in both rodents and primates. Viral strategies to restrict gene expression to PV neurons have also been recently developed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Mehta et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Vormstein-Schneider et al., 2020</xref>).</p>
<p>To facilitate the application of these inhibitory-neuron specific viral vectors to studies of the primate cortex, we have performed a thorough validation and characterization of the laminar expression of reporter proteins mediated by four of these AAVs. Here we report results from the two vector types that have shown the greatest specificity of transgene expression in marmoset primary visual cortex (V1); specifically, three serotypes of an AAV that restricts gene expression to GABAergic neurons under the <italic>h56D</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Mehta et al., 2019</xref>), and one serotype of an AAV that restricts gene expression to PV cells under the E2 regulatory element (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Vormstein-Schneider et al., 2020</xref>). Using injections of these viral vectors in marmoset V1, combined with immunohistochemical identification of GABA and PV neurons, we find that the laminar distribution of reporter protein expression mediated by the GABA-and PV-specific AAVs validated in this study resembles the laminar distribution of GABA-immunoreactive (GABA+) and PV-immunoreactive (PV+) cells, respectively, in marmoset V1. Reporter protein expression mediated by the GABA-virus is specific and robust, but the degree of specificity and coverage depends on serotype and cortical layer. We found that about 92% of PV cells in marmoset V1 are GABA+, and reporter protein expression mediated by the PV-AAV shows up to 98% specificity and 86-90% coverage. We conclude that these viral vectors offer the possibility of studying GABAergic and PV neuron connectivity and function in primate cortex.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>We validated 3 serotypes (1,7,9) of a GABA-specific AAV, specifically pAAV-h56D-tdTomato (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Mehta et al., 2019</xref>), as well as 3 different kinds of PV-specific AAVs, specifically a mixture of AAV1-PaqR4-Flp and AAV1-h56D-mCherry-FRT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Mehta et al., 2019</xref>), an AAV1-PV1-ChR2-eYFP (donated by G. Horwitz, University of Washington), and an AAV-PHP.eB-S5E2.tdTomato (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Vormstein-Schneider et al., 2020</xref>). Here we report results only from those vectors that were deemed to be most promising for use in primate cortex, based on infectivity and specificity. These were the 3 serotypes of the GABA-specific pAAV-h56D-tdTomato, and the PV-specific AAV-PHP.eB-S5E2.tdTomato. We report results from 10 viral injections (3 injections of AAV-h56D-tdTomato, 7 injections of AAV-PHP.eB-S5E2.tdTomato; see Methods) made in 4 marmoset monkeys. Tissue sections through V1 were double immunoreacted for GABA and PV and imaged on a fluorescent microscope. We quantified the laminar distribution of viral-induced tdTomato (tdT) expression as well as of GABA+ and PV+ cells revealed by immunohistochemistry (IHC), and counted double and triple-labeled cells to determine the specificity and coverage of viral-induced tdT expression across marmoset V1 layers (see Methods).</p>

<title>V1 laminar distribution of GABA+ and PV+ neurons</title>
<p>We first determined the V1 laminar distribution of GABA+ and PV+ neurons identified by IHC (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref></bold>). To this goal, in each section used for analysis, we counted GABA+ and PV+ cells within 2x100µm-wide regions of interest (ROIs) spanning all V1 layers for a total of 6 ROIs in 3 tissue sections. Cortical layer boundaries were determined using DAPI and/or PV staining (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B-C</xref></bold>), as we found that PV-IHC reveals laminar boundaries consistent with those defined by DAPI.</p>

<p>The laminar distribution of GABA+ and PV+ cells was quantified as percent of total GABA+ or PV+ cells (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref></bold>), as well as cell density (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref></bold>), in each cortical layer. Both measures revealed that both GABA+ and PV+ cells peak in layers (L) 2/3 and 4C. There was no significant difference in the percent or density of GABA+ cells in L 2/3 (33%±2, and 1,294 cells/mm<sup>2</sup>±74.4, respectively) vs. L 4C (33.4%±3.1, and 1,052 cells/mm<sup>2</sup>±42.2, respectively), as determined by a Bonferroni-corrected Kruskall-Wallis test (p=1, n=6 ROIs across 3 sections, L2/3 vs L4C in <bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref></bold>) or by a Bonferroni-corrected ANOVA test (p=1, n=6 ROIs across 3 sections, L2/3 vs L4C in <bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref></bold>). Similarly, the percent and density of PV+ cells in L4C (42.3%±3.6, and 888 cells/mm<sup>2</sup>±38.8, respectively) were not significantly different from those in L2/3 (31.3%±2.5 and 812 cells/mm<sup>2</sup>±65, respectively; p=1 for both comparisons, n=6 ROIs). However, density of PV+ cells in L4C was significantly higher than in all remaining layers (p&lt;0.05 for 4C vs. 4A/B, and &lt;0.001 for 4C vs. all other layers; ANOVA test with Bonferroni correction; n= 6 ROIs), and L2/3 PV+ density was significantly higher than L1, 5 and 6 (p&lt;0.001 for L2/3 vs. L1 and vs. L6, p=0.002 for L2/3 vs. L5, n=6 ROIs), but not L4A/B (although percent of PV+ cells in L2/3 was significantly higher than in L4A/B; p=0.029 Bonferroni corrected Kruskall-Wallis-test, n=6 ROIs). GABA+ cell density in L2/3 was significantly higher than in all other layers except L4C (p&lt;0.05 vs. L4A/B and L6, p&lt;0.01 vs. L1 and L5). GABA density in L4C did not differ from any other layers, but the percent of GABA+ cells in L4C was significantly higher than in L1 (p=0.009) and 4A/B (p=&lt;0.0001). As expected, within each layer, GABA+ cell density was significantly higher than PV+ cell density (p&lt;0.05, one-sided t-test for equality of means, n=6 ROIs).</p>

<p>We compared the laminar distributions of GABA+ and PV+ cell density in marmoset V1 with previously published distributions of these two cell markers in mouse V1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Xu et al., 2010</xref>). In marmoset V1, there is an overall higher density of PV+ cells than in mouse V1, with density peaking in L2/3 and 4C. In contrast, PV+ cell density in mouse V1 peaks in L4 and 5, and density in L2/3 is lower than in all other layers (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref></bold>). GABA+ cell density in marmoset V1 peaks in L2/3 followed by 4C, whereas it peaks in L4 and 5 with a smaller third peak in L2/3 in mouse V1 (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref></bold>).</p>
<p>Counts of cells double labeled for GABA+ and PV+ revealed that 92.3%±1.9 of PV+ cells across all layers were GABA+, and that PV+ cells represent on average 61.4%±2.7 of all GABA+ cells, ranging from 54.5%±3.7 in L6 to 78.5%±5.6 in L4C (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref></bold>). This differs from mouse V1 in which PV+ cells represent about 40% of all GABA cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Xu et al., 2010</xref>).</p>

<p><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref> shows three injection sites each of a different serotype (9,7,1) of the GABA-specific AAV-h56D-tdT (we refer to this virus as GABA-AAV). Identical injection volumes of each serotype, delivered at 3 different cortical depths (see Methods), resulted in different injection sizes, suggesting the different serotypes have different capacity of infecting cortical neurons. AAV7 produced the smallest injection site, which additionally was biased to the superficial and deep layers, with only few cells expressing tdT in the middle layers (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>).

In contrast, due to the lower capacity of AAV7 to infect the mid-layers, AAV7-induced tdT expression was relatively higher in L2/3 compared to GABA+ expression, approaching statistical significance (p=0.059; Bonferroni corrected independent-samples Median test, n=4 AAV7 ROIs and 6 GABA-IHC ROIs). The percent of AAV7-infected cells was also significantly higher than the percent of AAV9-and/or AAV1-infected cells in L2/3 (p=0.028 for both comparisons) and in L6 (p=0.028 for AAV7 vs. AAV1), and significantly lower than the percent of AAV9- and AAV1-infected cells in L4C (p=0.028 for both comparisons; Bonferroni corrected independent-samples Median test, n=4 ROIs).</p>

<p>To quantify the specificity of tdT expression induced by each serotype, i.e. the accuracy in inducing tdT expression selectively in GABA cells, for each serotype separately we measured the percent of tdT-expressing cells that colocalized with GABA expression revealed by IHC (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>). Overall, across all layers, AAV9 showed the highest specificity (82.3%±1.1) followed by AAV7 ( 79.2%±5.4), and AAV1 (75.3%±2.6), and there was a statistically significant difference in overall specificity between AAV9 and AAV1 (p=0.014; Bonferroni corrected independent-samples Median test, n=4 ROIs for each serotype). The specificity of AAV9 did not differ significantly across layers, ranging from 80.4%±21 in L4C to 93.8%±6.3 in L4A-B. In contrast, specificity for the other two serotypes varied by layer. AAV7 showed highest specificity in L1 (100% but there were only 2 tdT+ cells in this layer), L4C (90.1%±5.9) and L6 (87.1%%±8.1), and lowest in L4A/B (50%±35.4). AAV1 specificity was highest in L6 (85.4%±8.8) and L4C (81.6%±1.4) and lowest in LA-B (38.3%±21.7). There was a tendency for AAV9 to be more specific than AAV1 in L4A-B (93.8±6.3 vs 38.3±21.7), and L5 (88.8%±6.6 vs 59.4±8.3) but these differences did not reach statistical significance.</p>
<p>To quantify the efficiency of the virus in inducing tdT expression in GABA cells, for each serotype separately we measured the viral coverage as the the percent of GABA+ cells within the viral injection site that colocalized with tdT expression (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>). Overall, across all layers, AAV9 and AAV1 showed significantly higher coverage (66.1±3.9 and 64.9%±3.7) than AAV7, which showed much lower coverage values (34%±5.6; p=0.014 for both comparisons; Bonferroni corrected independent-samples Median test, n=4 ROIs across 2 sections for each serotype). AAV9 and AAV1 coverage was similar across layers, and both showed slightly higher coverage in superficial (AAV9: 67.4%±2.5; AAV1: 69%±6.5) and middle layers (AAV9: 78.5%±9.1; AAV1: 76.9%±7.4), compared to deep layers (AAV9:50-55%, AAV1: 44-60%). Instead, AAV7 showed very low coverage values in L4A-B (8.3%±8.3) and L4C (14.4%±6.7) and highest values in L6 (47.9%±4.3) followed by L2/3 (44.6%±9). AAV7 coverage was significantly lower than AAV9 coverage in L2/3 (p=0.014), L4A/B (p=0.014) and L4C (p=0.014), and was significantly lower than AAV1 in L4C (p= 0.014; Bonferroni corrected independent-samples Median test, n=4 ROIs for each serotype). Thus, AAV9 should be the serotype of choice for marmoset studies of GABAergic neurons requiring highest specificity and coverage across all layers, but AAV7 could be the serotype of choice for studies intending to restrict transgene expression to L6 or L2/3 GABA cells with good specificity.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Understanding the connectivity and function of inhibitory neurons and their subtypes in primate cortex requires the development of viral tools that allow for specific and robust transgene expression in these cell types. Recently, several viral vectors have been identified that selectively and efficiently restrict gene expression to GABAergic neurons and their subtypes across several species, but a thorough validation and characterization of these vectors in primate cortex has lacked. In this study, we have characterized several AAV vectors designed to restrict expression to GABAergic cells or their PV subtypes, and have identified two which show high specificity and coverage in marmoset V1. Specifically, we have shown that the GABA-specific AAV9-h56D (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Mehta et al., 2019</xref>) induces transgene expression in GABAergic cells with up to 91-94% specificity and 80% coverage, and the PV-specific AAV-PHP.eB-S5E2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Vormstein-Schneider et al., 2020</xref>) induces transgene expression in PV cells with up to 98% specificity and 86-90% coverage. We conclude that these two viral vector types provide useful tools to study inhibitory neuron connectivity and function in primate cortex.</p>
<p>Many recent studies have investigated the connectivity and function of distinct classes of inhibitory neurons in mouse V1 and other cortical areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Tremblay et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Wood et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Shin and Adesnik, 2023</xref>). In contrast, similar studies in the primate have been missing due to the lack of tools to selectively express transgenes in specific cell types and the difficulty of performing genetic manipulation in this species. It is important to study inhibitory neuron function in the primate, because it is unclear whether finding in mice apply to higher species, and inhibitory neuron dysfunction in humans has been implicated in several neurological and psychiatric disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Marin, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Goldberg and Coulter, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Lewis, 2014</xref>). While the basic inhibitory neuron subtypes seem to exist across most mammalian species studied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">DeFelipe, 2002</xref>) species differences may exist, particularly given the evolutionary distance between mouse and primate. Indeed, species differences have been reported in marker expression patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Hof et al., 1999</xref>), in the proportion of cortical GABAergic neurons (24-30% in primates vs. 15% in rodents) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Hendry et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Beaulieu, 1993</xref>), and in the proportion of PV neurons (74% in macaque V1 vs. 30-40% in mouse) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">van Brederode et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">DeFelipe et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Xu et al., 2010</xref>). Here, we found that PV cells in marmoset V1 across all layers represent on average 61% of all GABAergic cells, and up to 79% in V1 L4C. These percentages are lower than previously reported for macaque V1 by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Van Brederode et al. (1990)</xref> (74% across all layers and nearly 100% in L4C), but higher than recently reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Kelly et al. (2019)</xref> (52% across all V1 layers, up to 80% in L4C). We also found differences in the V1 laminar expression of both GABA+ and PV+ cells between mouse and marmoset. Specifically, GABA+ and PV+ expression peaks in L2/3 and 4C in marmoset V1, but in L4 and 5 in mouse V1. Similar differences between mouse and primate V1 in the laminar distribution of PV cells were reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Kooijmans et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Medalla et al., 2023</xref>). Our results on the laminar distribution of PV and GABA immunoreactivity is consistent with previous qualitative and quantitative studies in macaque V1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Hendry et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Blumcke et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">DeFelipe et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Disney and Aoki, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Kelly et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Kooijmans et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Medalla et al., 2023</xref>), and with a quantitative study in marmoset V1(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Goodchild and Martin, 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>We compared laminar distribution, specificity and coverage of three different serotypes of the AAV-h56D vector. Serotypes 9 and 7 showed slightly greater specificity than serotype 1, and the specificity of AAV9 was more consistent across layers than the specificity of serotypes 7 and 1, which instead varied somewhat across layers. Serotypes 9 and 1 showed greater coverage than serotype 7. Thus, serotype 9 is a better choice when high specificity and coverage across all layers are required. Serotype 7, instead, showed high specificity (80%) but low coverage (34%), except in layer 6 (48%) and L2/3 (45%), therefore, this serotype may be desirable to restrict transgene expression to L6 or 2/3 GABAergic cells.</p>
<p>We compared laminar distribution, specificity and coverage resulting from different volume injections of the AAV-PHP.eB-S5E2 vector. Injections of about 200nl volume resulted in higher specificity (95% across layers) and coverage (81% across all layers) than obtained with injection volumes larger than 300nl (specificity 82% and coverage 78% across all layers). This mild dose-dependent alteration of specificity could depend on some off-target expression reaching above detection levels at higher doses. Thus, injection volumes ≤300nl are recommended for studying PV neuron function and connectivity using this viral vector. Alternatively, or in addition, an apparent dose-dependent reduction in specificity may result from viral-induced suppression of PV immunoreactivity, which could be more pronounced for larger volume injections. Indeed, we found that both GABA- and PV-specific AAVs slightly, but significantly, reduced both GABA and PV immunoreactivity at the site of the viral injection, but GABA expression was more reduced at the GABA-AAV injection site, while reduction in PV expression was more marked at the PV-AAV injection site. This reduction in GABA and PV immunoreactivity at the viral injected sites most likely affected our measurements of specificity, suggesting that specificity for the viruses tested in this study is even higher than revealed by our counts. Our data does not allow us to assess the origin of the reduced GABA and PV immunoreactivity. Qualitative observations did not reveal structural damage at the site of the viral injections to suggest cell death. Notably, viral-induced downregulation of gene expression in host cells, including of inhibitory neuron marker genes such as <italic>PV</italic>, has been documented for rabies virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Prosniak et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Zhao et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Patino et al., 2022</xref>). As such, it is possible that subtle alteration of the cortical circuit upon parenchymal injection of viruses (including AAVs) leads to alteration of activity-dependent expression of <italic>PV</italic> and <italic>GABA</italic>.</p>

<title>Surgical Procedures</title>
<p>Animals were pre-anesthetized with alfaxalone (10mg/kg, i.m.) and midazolam (0.1mg/kg, i.m.) and an IV catheter was placed in either the saphenous or tail vein. To maintain proper hydration Lactated Ringers solution was continuously infused at 2-4 cc/kg/hr. The animal was then intubated with an endotracheal tube, placed in a stereotaxic apparatus, and artificially ventilated. Anesthesia was maintained with isoflurane (0.5-2.5%) in 100% oxygen. Throughout the experiment, end-tidal CO2, ECG, blood oxygenation, and rectal temperature were monitored continuously.</p>
<p>Under aseptic conditions the scalp was incised and several small (∼2mm) craniotomies and durotomies were made over dorsal V1. A single injection of a viral vector was made into each craniotomy. On completion of the injections, each craniotomy was filled with Gelfoam and sealed with dental cement, the skin was sutured, and the animal was recovered from anesthesia. Animals survived 3-4 weeks (one animal survived 2 weeks) post-injections, to allow for viral expression, and were sacrificed with Beuthanasia (0.22 ml/kg, i.p.) and perfused transcardially with saline for 2-3 minutes, followed by 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer for 15-20 minutes.</p>

<title>Injection of viral vectors</title>
<p>A total of 10 viral injections were made in 4 marmosets. Each of two animals received 1 injection, and one animal 5 injections (3 in one hemisphere and 2 in the other hemisphere) of AAV-PHP.eB-S5E2.tdTomato (titer 8.3E+09 vg/µl), obtained from the Dimidschstein laboratory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Vormstein-Schneider et al., 2020</xref>). The fourth animal received 3 injections, each of a different AAV serotype (1, 7, and 9) of the AAV-h56D-tdTomato (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Mehta et al., 2019</xref>), obtained from the Zemelman laboratory (UT Austin). Viral vectors were loaded in glass micropipettes (tip diameter 30-45 µm) and pressure injected using a PicoPump (World Precision Instruments). To ensure viral infection of all cortical layers, each injection was made at 3 depths within the cortical column: 1.2-1.5 mm from the cortical surface (deep), 0.8-1.0 mm (middle), and 0.4-0.6 mm (superficial). After injecting at each depth, the pipette was left in place for 2-4 minutes before being retracted to the next depth, and for 5 minutes before being fully retracted from the brain. The PV-specific AAV was injected at 4 different total volumes: 600 nl (1 injection), 300 nl (2 injections), 180 nl (2 injections) and 90-100 nl (2 injections). The GABA-AAVs were each injected at a total volume of 600 nl. One third of each total volume per injection was slowly (6-15 nl/min) injected at each of the 3 depths. For animals that received multiple injections in the same hemisphere, injections were spaced at least 3 mm apart to ensure no overlap.</p>

<title>Histology and Immunohistochemistry</title>
<p>Area V1 was dissected away from the rest of the visual cortex. The block was postfixed for 3-12 hours in 4% paraformaldehyde, sunk in 30% sucrose for cryoprotection, and frozen sectioned in the parasagittal plane at 40µm thickness. In one case (MM423), the brain was sunk in a 20% glycerol solution and frozen at −70°C for 6 months prior to being sectioned. To locate the viral injection sites, a 1:5 series of tissue sections were wet-mounted and observed under microscopic fluorescent illumination. Sections containing each injection site had their coverslips removed, and fluorescent immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed on free-floating sections to reveal both GABA+ and PV+ neurons. GABA and PV IHC was performed by incubating sections for 3 days at 4°C in primary antibody, followed by 12-hour incubation at room temperature in secondary antibody. The primary and secondary antibodies used for GABA-IHC were a rabbit anti-GABA antibody (1:200; Sigma Aldrich, Burlington, MA; RRID:AB_477652) and an Alexa Fluor® 647 AffiniPure™ Donkey Anti-Rabbit IgG (H+L) (1:200; Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratoris Inc., West Grove, PA; RRID:AB_2492288), respectively.

<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>Multi-channel wide-field fluorescent images of V1 tissue sections containing an injection site spanning all layers were acquired at 5-7 depths in the z plane using a Zeiss AxioImager Z2 fluorescent microscope equipped with a 10x objective. Images were stitched, rotated, and cropped as necessary using Zen Blue software (Carl Zeiss AG) and loaded into Neurolucida software (MBF Bioscience) for data quantification. To quantify inhibitory neurons that expressed the viral-mediated reporter protein tdTomato, GABA+ and PV+ neurons revealed by IHC at the viral injection sites (i.e. the data shown in <bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figs. 4</xref>,<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref></bold>, and the “IN” data in <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>), we counted single, double- and triple-labeled cells across two 100μm-wide ROIs extending through all layers at the injection site on each channel, yielding a total of 4 ROIs across 2 tissue sections being counted and analyzed for each viral injection site. To quantify the normal distribution of GABA+ and PV+ immunoreactivity in control tissue (i.e. the data shown in <bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figs. 2</xref></bold>, and the “OUT” data in <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>) we counted single and double-labeled cells across two 100μm-wide ROI’s extending through all layers in each tissue section for a total of 6 ROIs across 3 sections. The ROIs for this analysis were selected to be millimeters away from the V1 region containing the viral injection sites. Cell counting was performed by two undergraduate researchers (AI, PB) and reviewed for accuracy by senior lab members (FF, AA). Cortical layer boundaries were determined using DAPI staining or PV-IHC (after confirming the layer boundaries based on PV-IHC matched those seen in DAPI). Data collected in Neurolucida were exported to Excel (Microsoft) and SPSS (IBM) software for quantitative and statistical analyses.</p>

<p>Unlocking the potential of molecular genetic tools (optogenetics, chemogenetics, sensors, etc.) for the study of systems neuroscience in nonhuman primates requires the development of effective regulatory elements for cell-type specific expression to facilitate circuit dissection. This study provides a <bold>valuable</bold> building block, by carefully characterizing the laminar expression profile of two viral vectors, one designed for general GABA+ergic neurons and the second for parvalbumin+ cell-type selective expression in the marmoset primary visual cortex. The authors provide <bold>solid</bold> evidence for the first enhancer S5E2 and <bold>incomplete</bold> evidence for the second one, h56D. This study contributes to our understanding of these tools but is limited by the understandably small number of animals used.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Federer et al. tested AAVs designed to target GABAergic cells and parvalbumin-expressing cells in marmoset V1. Several new results were obtained. First, AAV-h56D targeted GABAergic cells with &gt;90% specificity, and this varied with serotype and layer. Second, AAV-PHP.eB.S5E2 targeted parvalbumin-expressing neurons with up to 98% specificity. Third, the immunohistochemical detection of GABA and PV was attenuated near viral injection sites.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Vormstein-Schneider et al. (2020) tested their AAV-S5E2 vector in marmosets by intravenous injection. The data presented in this manuscript are valuable in part because they show the transduction pattern produced by intraparenchymal injections, which are more conventional and efficient.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The conclusions regarding the effects of serotype are based on data from single injection tracks in a single animal. I understand that ethical and financial constraints preclude high throughput testing, but these limitations do not change what can be inferred from the measurements. The text asserts that &quot;...serotype 9 is a better choice when high specificity and coverage across all layers are required&quot;. The data presented are consistent with this idea but do not make a strong case for it.</p>
<p>A related criticism extends to the analysis of injection volume on viral specificity. Some replication was performed here, but reliability across injections was not reported. My understanding is that individual ROIs were treated as independent observations. These are not biological replicates (arguably, neither are multiple injection tracks in a single animal, but they are certainly closer). Idiosyncrasies between animals or injections (e.g. if one injection happened to hit one layer more than another) could have substantial impacts on the measurements. It remains unclear which results regarding injection volume or serotype would hold up had a large number of injections been made into a large number of marmosets.</p>

<p>This is a straightforward manuscript assessing the specificity and efficiency of transgene expression in marmoset primary visual cortex (V1), for 4 different AAV vectors known to target transgene expression to either inhibitory cortical neurons (3 serotypes of AAV-h56D-tdTomato) or parvalbumin (PV)+ inhibitory cortical neurons in mice. Vectors are injected into the marmoset cortex and then postmortem tissue is analyzed following antibody labeling against GABA and PV. It is reported that: &quot;in marmoset V1 AAV-h56D induces transgene expression in GABAergic cells with up to 91-94% specificity and 80% efficiency, depending on viral serotype and cortical layer. AAV-PHP.eB-S5E2 induces transgene expression in PV cells across all cortical layers with up to 98% specificity and 86-90% efficiency.&quot;</p>
<p>These claims are largely supported but slightly exaggerated relative to the actual values in the results presented. In particular, the overall efficiency for the best h56D vectors described in the results is: &quot;Overall, across all layers, AAV9 and AAV1 showed significantly higher coverage (66.1{plus minus}3.9 and 64.9%{plus minus}3.7)&quot;. The highest coverage observed is just in middle layers and is also less than 80%: &quot;(AAV9: 78.5%{plus minus}9.1; AAV1: 76.9%{plus minus}7.4)&quot;. For the AAV-PHP.eB-S5E2 the efficiency reported in the abstract (&quot;86-90%) is also slightly exaggerated relative to the results: &quot;Overall, across all layers coverage ranged from 78%{plus minus}1.9 for injection volumes &gt;300nl to 81.6%{plus minus}1.8 for injection volumes of 100nl.&quot;</p>
<p>These data will be useful to others who might be interested in targeting transgene expression in these cell types in monkeys. Suggestions for improvement are to include more details about the vectors injected and to delete some comments about results that are not documented based on vectors that are not described (see below).</p>
<p>Major comments:</p>
<p>Details provided about the AAV vectors used with the h56D enhancer are not sufficient to allow assessment of their potential utility relative to the results presented. All that is provided is: &quot;The fourth animal received 3 injections, each of a different AAV serotype (1, 7, and 9) of the AAV-h56D-tdTomato (Mehta et al., 2019), obtained from the Zemelman laboratory (UT Austin).&quot; At a minimum, it is necessary to provide the titers of each of the vectors. It would also be helpful to provide more information about viral preparation for both these vectors and the AAVPHP.eB-S5E2.tdTomato. Notably, what purification methods were used, and what specific methods were used to measure the titers?</p>
<p>The first paragraph of the results includes brief anecdotal claims without any data to support them and without any details about the relevant vectors that would allow any data that might have been collected to be critically assessed. These statements should be deleted. Specifically, delete: &quot;as well as 3 different kinds of PV-specific AAVs, specifically a mixture of AAV1-PaqR4-Flp and AAV1-h56D-mCherry-FRT (Mehta et al., 2019), an AAV1-PV1-ChR2-eYFP (donated by G. Horwitz, University of Washington),&quot; and delete &quot;Here we report results only from those vectors that were deemed to be most promising for use in primate cortex, based on infectivity and specificity. These were the 3 serotypes of the GABA-specific pAAV-h56D-tdTomato, and the PV-specific AAVPHP.eB-S5E2.tdTomato.&quot; These tools might in fact be just as useful or even better than what is actually tested and reported here, but maybe the viral titer was too low to expect any expression.</p>
<p>Based on the description in the Methods it seems that no antibody labeling against TdTomato was used to amplify the detection of the transgenes expressed from the AAV vectors. It should be verified that this is the case - a statement could be added to the Methods.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Federer et al. describe the laminar profiles of GABA+ and of PV+ neurons in marmoset V1. They also report on the selectivity and efficiency of expression of a PV-selective enhancer (S5E2). Three further viruses were tested, with a view to characterizing the expression profiles of a GABA-selective enhancer (h56d), but these results are preliminary.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The derivation of cell-type specific enhancers is key for translating the types of circuit analyses that can be performed in mice - which rely on germline modifications for access to cell-type specific manipulation - in higher-order mammals. Federer et al. further validate the utility of S5E2 as a PV-selective enhancer in NHPs.</p>
<p>Additionally, the authors characterize the laminar distribution pattern of GABA+ and PV+ cells in V1. This survey may prove valuable to researchers seeking to understand and manipulate the microcircuitry mediating the excitation-inhibition balance in this region of the marmoset brain.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Enhancer/promoter specificity and efficiency cannot be directly compared, because they were packaged in different serotypes of AAV.</p>
<p>The three different serotypes of AAV expressing reporter under the h56D promoter were only tested once each, and all in the same animal. There are many variables that can contribute to the success (or failure) of a viral injection, so observations with an n=1 cannot be considered reliable.</p>
<p>The language used throughout conflates the cell-type specificity conferred by the regulatory elements with that conferred by the serotype of the virus.</p>

<p><bold>eLife assessment</bold></p>
<p>Unlocking the potential of molecular genetic tools (optogenetics, chemogenetics, sensors, etc.) for the study of systems neuroscience in nonhuman primates requires the development of effective regulatory elements for cell-type specific expression to facilitate circuit dissection. This study provides a valuable building block, by carefully characterizing the laminar expression profile of two viral vectors, one designed for general GABA+ergic neurons and the second for parvalbumin+ cell-type selective expression in the marmoset primary visual cortex. The authors provide solid evidence for the first enhancer S5E2 and incomplete evidence for the second one, h56D. This study contributes to our understanding of these tools but is limited by the understandably small number of animals used.</p>
<p><bold>Public Reviews:</bold></p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Federer et al. tested AAVs designed to target GABAergic cells and parvalbumin-expressing cells in marmoset V1. Several new results were obtained. First, AAV-h56D targeted GABAergic cells with &gt;90% specificity, and this varied with serotype and layer. Second, AAV-PHP.eB.S5E2 targeted parvalbumin-expressing neurons with up to 98% specificity. Third, the immunohistochemical detection of GABA and PV was attenuated near viral injection sites.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Vormstein-Schneider et al. (2020) tested their AAV-S5E2 vector in marmosets by intravenous injection. The data presented in this manuscript are valuable in part because they show the transduction pattern produced by intraparenchymal injections, which are more conventional and efficient.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Our manuscript additionally provides detailed information on the laminar specificity and coverage of these viral vectors, which was not investigated in the original studies.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The conclusions regarding the effects of serotype are based on data from single injection tracks in a single animal. I understand that ethical and financial constraints preclude high throughput testing, but these limitations do not change what can be inferred from the measurements. The text asserts that &quot;...serotype 9 is a better choice when high specificity and coverage across all layers are required&quot;. The data presented are consistent with this idea but do not make a strong case for it.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We are aware of the limitations of our results on the AAV-h56D. We agree with the Reviewer that a single injection per serotype does not allow us to make strong statements about differences between the 3 serotypes. Therefore, in the revised version of the manuscript we will temper our claims about such differences and use more caution in the interpretation of these data. Despite this weakness, we feel that these data still demonstrate high efficiency and specificity across cortical layers of transgene expression in GABA cells using the h56D promoter, at least with two of the 3 AAV serotypes we tested. We feel that in itself this is sufficiently useful information for the primate community, worthy of being reported. Due to cost, time and ethical considerations related to the use of primates, we chose not to perform additional experiments to determine precise differences among serotypes. Thus, for example, while it is possible that had we replicated these experiments, serotype 7 would have proven equally efficient and specific as the other two serotypes, we felt answering this question did not warrant additional experiments in this precious species.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>A related criticism extends to the analysis of injection volume on viral specificity. Some replication was performed here, but reliability across injections was not reported. My understanding is that individual ROIs were treated as independent observations. These are not biological replicates (arguably, neither are multiple injection tracks in a single animal, but they are certainly closer). Idiosyncrasies between animals or injections (e.g. if one injection happened to hit one layer more than another) could have substantial impacts on the measurements. It remains unclear which results regarding injection volume or serotype would hold up had a large number of injections been made into a large number of marmosets.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>For the AAV-S5E2, we made a total of 7 injections (at least 2 at the same volume), all of which, irrespective of volume, resulted in high specificity and efficiency for PV interneurons. Our conclusion is that larger volumes are slightly less specific, but the differences are minimal and do not warrant additional injections. Additionally, all of our injections involved all cortical layers, and the ROIs we selected for counts encompassed reporter protein expression across all layers. To provide a better sense of the reliability of the results across injections, in the revised version of the manuscript we will provide a supplementary table with results for each injection case separately.</p>

<p>This is a straightforward manuscript assessing the specificity and efficiency of transgene expression in marmoset primary visual cortex (V1), for 4 different AAV vectors known to target transgene expression to either inhibitory cortical neurons (3 serotypes of AAV-h56D-tdTomato) or parvalbumin (PV)+ inhibitory cortical neurons in mice. Vectors are injected into the marmoset cortex and then postmortem tissue is analyzed following antibody labeling against GABA and PV. It is reported that: &quot;in marmoset V1 AAV-h56D induces transgene expression in GABAergic cells with up to 91-94% specificity and 80% efficiency, depending on viral serotype and cortical layer. AAV-PHP.eB-S5E2 induces transgene expression in PV cells across all cortical layers with up to 98% specificity and 86-90% efficiency.&quot;</p>
<p>These claims are largely supported but slightly exaggerated relative to the actual values in the results presented. In particular, the overall efficiency for the best h56D vectors described in the results is: &quot;Overall, across all layers, AAV9 and AAV1 showed significantly higher coverage (66.1{plus minus}3.9 and 64.9%{plus minus}3.7)&quot;. The highest coverage observed is just in middle layers and is also less than 80%: &quot;(AAV9: 78.5%{plus minus}9.1; AAV1: 76.9%{plus minus}7.4)&quot;.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In the abstract, we indeed summarize the overall data and round up the decimals, and state that these parentages are upper bound and that they vary by serotype and layer, while in the Results we report the detailed counts with decimals. To clarify this, in the revised version of the Abstract we will change 80% to 79% and emphasize even more clearly the dependence on serotype and layer. We will amend this sentence of the Abstract as follows: “We show that in marmoset V1 AAV-h56D induces transgene expression in GABAergic cells with up to 91-94% specificity and 79% efficiency, but this depends on viral serotype and cortical layer.”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>For the AAV-PHP.eB-S5E2 the efficiency reported in the abstract (&quot;86-90%) is also slightly exaggerated relative to the results: &quot;Overall, across all layers coverage ranged from 78%{plus minus}1.9 for injection volumes &gt;300nl to 81.6%{plus minus}1.8 for injection volumes of 100nl.&quot;</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Indeed, the numbers in the Abstract are upper bounds, for example efficiency in L4A/B with S5E2 reaches 90%. To further clarify this important point, in the revised abstract we will state ”AAV-PHP.eB-S5E2 induces transgene expression in PV cells across all cortical layers with up to 98% specificity and 86-90% efficiency, depending on layer”.</p>

<p>We thank the Reviewer for this comment. In the revised version of the manuscript, we will provide a Table with titers of each viral vector injected as well as more information regarding viral preparation methods. In fact, the methods for viral preparation and purification are detailed in the original publications so we feel it may be sufficient to cite the original papers?</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>This data is indeed anecdotal, and while we could delete it from the manuscript, as suggested by the Reviewer, we feel it could be useful information for the scientific community. It could prevent other labs from wasting resources, animals and time, particularly, as some of these vectors have been reported to be selective and efficient in the primate cortex, which we have not been able to confirm. We made several injections in several animals of those vectors that failed either to infect a sufficient number of cells or turned out to be poorly specific. Therefore, the negative results have been consistent. But we agree with the Reviewer that our negative results could have depended on factors such as titer. In the revised version of the manuscript, we will provide a supplementary Methods section in which we will report the specifics of the vectors that failed in our hands (i.e. number of injections made in how many animals, volumes, survival time, and titers).</p>

<p>That is indeed the case. We used no immunohistochemistry to enhance the reporter proteins as this was unnecessary. The native / non-emplified tdT signal was strong.</p>
