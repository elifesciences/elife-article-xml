<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Channel capacity of signaling networks quantifies their fidelity in sensing extracellular inputs. Low estimates of channel capacities for several mammalian signaling networks suggest that cells can barely detect the presence/absence of environmental signals. However, given the extensive heterogeneity in cell states, we hypothesize that the sensing ability itself varies from cell to cell in a cell state dependent manner. In this work, we present an information theoretic framework to quantify the distribution of sensing abilities from single cell data. Using data on two mammalian pathways, we show that sensing abilities are widely distributed in the population and most cells achieve better resolution of inputs than what is implied by traditional cell state agnostic estimates. We verify these predictions using live cell imaging data on the IGFR/FoxO pathway. Importantly, we identify cell state variables that correlate with cells’ sensing abilities. This information theoretic framework will significantly improve our understanding of how cells sense in their environment.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In cell populations, there is a significant overlap in cellular responses to environmental stimuli of differing strengths. This raises a fundamental question<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>: do signaling networks in cells relay accurate information about their environment to take appropriate action? And if not, where along the signal transduction pathway is the information lost<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>? Mutual information (MI) quantifies the information content in a cellular output about extracellular inputs. For an input <italic>x</italic> (e.g., concentration of a ligand) and an output (e.g., intracellular species concentration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup> or a cellular phenotype<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>), the MI is defined as<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>
<disp-formula id="eqn1">
<alternatives><graphic xlink:href="531554v2_eqn1.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives>
</disp-formula>
Experimental single cell methods such as flow cytometry<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>, immunofluorescence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>, mass spectrometry<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>, or live cell imaging<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup> allow us to estimate response histograms <italic>p</italic>(<italic>x</italic>|<italic>u</italic>) across several inputs. Using these distributions, we can estimate the maximum of the MI (the channel capacity, CC) by optimizing <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn1">Eq. 1</xref> over input distributions <italic>p</italic> (<italic>u</italic>). The CC quantifies fidelity of signal transduction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. For example, a CC of 1 bit implies that that the cells can at best distinguish between two input levels, with higher CCs indicating that cells can resolve multiple input states. Importantly, CC can be used to identify bottlenecks in signaling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>The CC has been estimated for input-output relationships in several mammalian signaling networks<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>– <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. When the output is defined as levels of a single protein a fixed time, the CC was found to be surprisingly low, ∼1 − 1.5 bits. These estimates have been improved by considering multidimensional outputs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup> or time varying inputs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. While these modifications led to somewhat higher CC estimates, the overall conclusion that cells know little about their environment remains well established. In contrast, significantly higher CC estimates have been found when the output is defined as an average over the cell population<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>, suggesting that the only way to overcome low sensing fidelity is collective response.</p>
<p>These previous calculations estimated one channel capacity for all cells in a population, implicitly assuming that individual cells have similar sensing capabilities. We now know that cells exhibit extensive heterogeneity in cell state variables such as abundances of key signaling proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>, gene expression levels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>, epigenetic status<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>, etc. These variables can remain constant throughout cells’ entire life cycle and beyond<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>. Heterogeneity in cell state variables leads to a variability in response to extracellular cues, including chemotherapeutic drugs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>, mitogens<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>, hormones<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>, and chemotactic signals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. Therefore, it is quite reasonable to expect that cells have variable abilities to sense their environment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>. And that the differences in cells’ abilities are explained by differences in cell states.</p>
<p>There is currently no conceptual framework or computational algorithms to estimate the distribution of sensing abilities in cell populations. To that end, we introduce an information theoretic quantity CeeMI: Cell state dependent Mutual Information. We show that using typically collected single cell data and a computational model of the underlying signaling network, we can estimate the distribution <italic>p</italic><sub>CeeMI</sub> (<italic>I</italic>) of single cell signaling fidelities (single cell mutual information values). We also show that we can identify cell state variables that make some cells better and others worse at sensing their environment.</p>
<p>Using an illustrative example, we show that in heterogeneous cell populations, the traditional cell state agnostic estimate of mutual information is significantly lower than the mutual information of signaling networks in typical cells. Next, using previously collected experimental data, we estimate <italic>p</italic><sub>CeeMI</sub> (<italic>I</italic>) for two important mammalian signaling pathways; the Epidermal growth factor (EGF)/EGF receptor pathway<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup> and the Insulin like growth factor (IGF)/Forkhead Box protein O (FoxO) pathway<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>, we show that while the cell state agnostic CC estimates for both pathways are ∼ 1 bit, most individual cells are predicted to be significantly better at resolving different inputs. Using live cell imaging data for the IGF/FoxO pathway, we show that our estimate of variability in sensing abilities matches closely with experimental estimates. Importantly, for this pathway, we also verify our prediction that specific cell state variables dictate cells’ sensing abilities. We believe that CeeMI will be an important tool to explore variability in cellular sensing abilities and in identifying what makes some cells better and others worse in sensing their environment.</p>

<p>Consider a cell population where cells are characterized by state variables <bold><italic>θ</italic></bold>.

We assume that these variables are distributed in the population according to a distribution <italic>p</italic>(<bold><italic>θ</italic></bold>). If <italic>x</italic> denotes an output of choice (e.g., phosphorylation levels of some protein at a specific time) and <italic>u</italic> denotes the input (e.g., ligand concentration), the experimentally measured response distribution <italic>p</italic>(<italic>x</italic>|<italic>u</italic>) can be decomposed as:

where <italic>p</italic>(<italic>x</italic>|<italic>u</italic>, <bold><italic>θ</italic></bold>) is the distribution of the output <italic>x</italic> conditioned on the input <italic>u</italic> and cell state variables <bold><italic>θ</italic></bold>.

<p>Using <italic>p</italic>(<italic>x</italic>|<italic>u</italic>, <bold><italic>θ</italic></bold>), we can define the cell state dependent mutual information <italic>I</italic>(<bold><italic>θ</italic></bold>) for a fixed input distribution <italic>p</italic>(<italic>u</italic>) analogously to <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn1">Eq. 1</xref>:

In information theory, <italic>I</italic><sub>Cee</sub> is known as the conditional mutual information<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup> between the input <italic>u</italic> and the output <italic>x</italic> conditioned on <bold><italic>θ</italic></bold>. From these definitions of it can be shown that <italic>I</italic><sub>Cee</sub> ≥ <italic>I</italic> (SI Section 1). That is, if cell state variables remain approximately constant, at least some cells in the population have better sensing abilities compared to what is implied by the cell state agnostic mutual information (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn1">Eq. 1</xref>). Since <italic>I</italic><sub>Cee</sub> depends on the input distribution <italic>p</italic>(<italic>u</italic>),we can find an optimal input distribution <italic>p</italic>(<italic>u</italic>) that maximizes <italic>I</italic><sub>Cee</sub> (SI Section 1).

<title>Maximum entropy inference can estimate <italic>p</italic><sub>CeeMI</sub> (<italic>I</italic>)</title>
<p>Estimation of <italic>p</italic><sub>CeeMI</sub> (<italic>I</italic>) requires decomposing the experimentally observed response <italic>p</italic>(<italic>x</italic>|<italic>u</italic>) into cell specific output distributions <italic>p</italic>(<italic>x</italic>|<italic>u</italic>, <bold><italic>θ</italic></bold>) and the distribution of cell state variables <italic>p</italic>(<italic>θ</italic>) (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn3">Eq. 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn4">4</xref>). This problem is difficult to solve given that neither of these distributions are accessible in typical experiments. For many signaling networks, stochastic biochemical models can be constructed to obtain the cell specific output distribution <italic>p</italic>(<italic>x</italic>|<italic>u</italic>, <bold><italic>θ</italic></bold>). Here, <bold><italic>χ</italic></bold> comprise protein concentrations and effective rates of enzymatic reactions and serve as a proxy for cell state variables.

The problem of inference of parameter heterogeneity is a non-trivial inverse problem<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>. We use our previously develop maximum entropy-based approach<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup> to infer <italic>p</italic>(<bold><italic>θ</italic></bold>). This way, we can estimate <italic>p</italic> <sub>CeeMI</sub> (<italic>I</italic>) using experimentally obtained cell state agnostic response <italic>p</italic>(<italic>x</italic>|<italic>u</italic>) and a stochastic biochemical model of the underlying signaling network.</p>

<title>Cell state agnostic mutual information underestimates cells’ ability to sense their environment</title>
<p>To illustrate the effect of heterogeneity of cell state variables on the cell state agnostic estimate of mutual information (which we call cell state agnostic mutual information or <italic>I</italic><sub>CSA</sub> from now onwards), we consider a simple stochastic biochemical network of a receptor-ligand system. Details of the model and the calculations presented below can be found in SI Section 2. Briefly, extracellular ligand <italic>L</italic> binds to cell surface receptors <italic>R</italic>. Steady state levels of the ligand bound receptor <italic>B</italic> is considered the output. The signaling network is parametrized by several cell state variables <bold><italic>θ</italic></bold> such as receptor levels, rates of binding/unbinding, etc. For simplicity, we assume that only one variable, steady state receptor level <italic>R</italic><sub>0</sub> in the absence of the ligand, varies in the population. Calculations with variability in other parameters are presented in SI Section 2.</p>
<p>In this population, cells’ response <italic>p</italic>(<italic>B</italic>|<italic>L,R</italic><sub>0</sub>) is distributed as a Poisson distribution whose mean is proportional to the cell state variable <italic>R</italic><sub>0</sub> (SI Section 2). That is, when all other parameters are fixed, a higher <italic>R</italic><sub>0</sub> leads to lower noise. To calculate cell state dependent mutual information (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn3">Eq. 3</xref>), we assume that <italic>p</italic>(<italic>L</italic>) is a gamma distribution. As expected, <italic>I</italic>(<italic>R</italic><sub>0</sub>) (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn3">Eq. 3</xref>) between the output <italic>B</italic> and the input <italic>L</italic> increases monotonically with <italic>R</italic><sub>0</sub> (inset in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). Moreover, given that <italic>R</italic><sub>0</sub> varies in the population</p>

<p>(assumed to be a gamma distribution as well), the sensing ability varies in the population as well (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). Notably, the average <italic>I</italic><sub>Cee</sub> of <italic>I</italic>(<italic>R</italic><sub>0</sub>) remains relatively robust to variation in <italic>R</italic><sub>0</sub>. At the same time, the traditional estimate <italic>I</italic><sub>CSA</sub>, which is the mutual information between the input <italic>L</italic> and the cell state agnostic population response <italic>p</italic>(<italic>B</italic>|<italic>L</italic>) = ∫ <italic>p</italic>(<italic>B</italic>|<italic>L, R</italic><sub>0</sub>) <italic>p</italic>(<italic>R</italic><sub>0</sub>) d<italic>R</italic><sub>0</sub> (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn1">Eq. 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn2">Eq. 2</xref>), decreases as the population heterogeneity in <italic>R</italic><sub>0</sub> increases. Importantly, <italic>I</italic><sub>CSA</sub> is significantly lower than the sensing ability of most cells in the population (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). This is because the overlap in the population response distributions is significantly larger than single cell response distributions (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>), which arises due to the variability in cell state variables. This simple example illustrates that the traditional mutual information estimates may severely underestimate cells’ ability to resolve inputs, especially when parameters are heterogeneously distributed. Moreover, it is crucial to explicitly account for heterogeneity in cell state variables when estimating fidelity of cellular communication channels.</p>

<p>In real cell populations, state variables that govern signaling dynamics such as protein levels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup> (receptors, kinases, dephosphatases, etc.), endocytosis rates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>, ligand binding rates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>, etc. are known to vary from cell to cell. Therefore, we expect the sensing abilities to be widely distributed as well. To experimentally verify the computational prediction of the distribution <italic>p</italic><sub>CeeMI</sub> (<italic>I</italic>) of sensing abilities, we need an experimental system that allows us to approximate the cell state specific response distribution <italic>p</italic>(<italic>x</italic>|<italic>u</italic>, <bold><italic>θ</italic></bold>). The IGF/FoxO pathway is an ideal system for these explorations for several reasons. First, following IGF stimulation, the transcription factor FoxO is pulled out of the nucleus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>. GFP-tagged variant of FoxO can be used to detect the dynamics of nuclear levels of FoxO at the single cell level<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>. Second, nuclear FoxO levels reach an approximate steady state within 30-45 minutes of constant IGF stimulation with FoxO levels decreasing with increasing IGF dose<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>. As a result, an approximate cell state specific distribution <italic>p</italic>(<italic>x</italic> |<italic>u</italic>, <bold><italic>θ</italic></bold>) of steady state levels of FoxO can be obtained by stimulating the same cell with successive IGF levels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>. Finally, the biochemical interactions in the IGF/FoxO are well studied<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>), allowing us to a build stochastic biochemical model based on previous computational efforts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup> that fits the single cell data accurately. Another system where <italic>p</italic><sub>CeeMI</sub> (<italic>I</italic>) can in principle be verified is the EGF/EGFR pathway<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>). Here too, abundance of cell surface EGFR levels can be tracked in live cells following EGF stimulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>, allowing us to obtain cell-state specific response distribution <italic>p</italic>(<italic>x</italic>|<italic>u</italic>, <bold><italic>θ</italic></bold>). Below, we show estimates of <italic>p</italic><sub>CeeMI</sub>(<italic>I</italic>) for both pathways and an experimental verification of our estimates for the IGF/FoxO pathway where live-cell imaging data was previously collected<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>The details of the calculations presented below can be found in SI Sections 3 and 4. Briefly, we first constructed stochastic biochemical models for the two pathways based on known interactions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>) and previous models<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>. The output for the EGFR pathway was defined as the steady state levels of cell surface EGF receptors and the output for the IGF/FoxO pathway was defined as the steady state nuclear levels of the transcription factor FoxO. Using previously collected single cell data on the two pathways<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup> and our maximum entropy-based framework<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>, we estimated the distribution over parameters <italic>p</italic>(<bold><italic>θ</italic></bold>) for the two pathways (SI Section 3). Using these inferred distributions, and the model-predicted cell state specific response distribution <italic>p</italic>(<italic>x</italic>|<italic>u</italic>, <bold><italic>θ</italic></bold>), we can compute <italic>p</italic><sub>CeeMI</sub> (<italic>I</italic>) for any specified input distribution <italic>p</italic>(<italic>u</italic>). We choose the support of the input distribution as the ligand concentrations used in the experimental setup. The estimates shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref> show <italic>p</italic><sub>CeeMI</sub>(<italic>I</italic>) corresponding to the input distribution that maximizes the conditional mutual information <italic>I</italic><sub>Cee</sub> (see <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn6">Eq. 6</xref>).</p>
<p>Similar to the illustrative example (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>), there is a wide distribution of single cell sensing fidelities in real populations (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref>). Moreover, most cells are better sensors compared to what is indicated by the maximum of <italic>I</italic><sub>CSA</sub> which was estimated to be ∼ 1 bit for both pathways. Indeed, as seen in the insets of <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref>, the input distribution corresponding to the maximum of <italic>I</italic><sub>CSA</sub> is concentrated on the lowest and the highest input for both pathways, indicating that cells may be able to detect only two input levels. In contrast, the input distribution corresponding to the maximum of <italic>I</italic><sub>Cee</sub> is close to uniform, suggesting that individual cells can in fact resolve different ligand levels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>To verify our computational estimate of <italic>p</italic><sub>CeeMI</sub> (<italic>I</italic>) for the IGF/FoxO pathway, we reanalyzed previously collected data<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup> wherein several cells were stimulated using successive IGF levels. The details of our calculations can be found in SI Section 4. Briefly, the cells reached an approximate steady state within 60 minutes of each stimulation and nuclear FoxO levels measured between 60 to 90 minutes were used to approximate an experimental cell state specific response distribution <italic>p</italic>(<italic>x</italic>|<italic>u</italic>, <bold><italic>θ</italic></bold>). The distribution <italic>p</italic><sub>CeeMI</sub> (<italic>I</italic>) was then obtained by maximizing the average mutual information <italic>I</italic><sub>Cee</sub> (averaged over all cells) with respect to the input distribution. As seen in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref>, the experimentally evaluated single cell signaling fidelities match closely with our computational estimates. Moreover, as predicted using our computational analysis, individual cells in the population were significantly better at sensing than what is implied by the maximum of <italic>I</italic><sub>CSA</sub>. Indeed, the distribution of steady state FoxO levels were found to be well-resolved at the single cell level as well (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref>). Live cell imaging data for the EGFR pathway was not available and we leave it to future studies to validate our predictions.</p>
<p>Our calculations show that real cell populations comprise cells that have differing sensing fidelities, individual cells are significantly better at sensing their environment than what traditional estimates would indicate, and importantly, the CeeMI approach can accurately estimate the variation in signaling performances using readily collected experimental data and stochastic biochemical models.</p>

<title>CeeMI identifies biochemical parameters that determine cells’ ability to sense their environment</title>
<p>We expect that cells’ ability to sense their environment depends on their state variables. Our approach allows us to quantify the joint distribution <italic>p</italic><sub>CeeMI</sub> (<italic>I, χ</italic>) of single cell signaling fidelity and biochemical state variables that take part in the signaling network. To test whether we can identify variables that are predictive of cellular fidelity, we estimated the joint distribution <italic>p</italic><sub>CeeMI</sub>(<italic>I, χ</italic>) for two variables that were experimentally accessible, response range of nuclear FoxO (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> left, see inset) and total nuclear FoxO levels prior to IGF stimulation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> right, see inset). In both figures, the shaded regions show computational estimates of the joint probability distributions, and the red circles represent real cells.

<p>One may expect that higher total nuclear FoxO levels could result in lower noise and therefore better sensing abilities. However, we find that total nuclear FoxO levels only weakly correlate with cell state dependent mutual information (correlation coefficient <italic>r</italic> = 0.16 for computational estimates and <italic>r</italic> = 0.04 for experimental data). In contrast, cell state dependent mutual information depended strongly on the dynamic range of the response (correlation coefficient <italic>r</italic> = 0.53 for computational estimates and <italic>r</italic> = 0.29 for experimental data). Importantly, the model captured the observation that cells with a small response range had a variable sensing abilities while cells with a large response range all performed well in resolving extracellular IGF levels. Surprisingly, the total nuclear FoxO levels only weakly correlated with the cell specific mutual information. In SI Section 5, we show the predicted joint distributions <italic>p</italic><sub>CeeMI</sub>(<italic>I, χ</italic>) for several other biochemical variables that can potentially govern single cells’ response to extracellular IGF stimuli. This way, CeeMI can be used to systematically identify cell state variables that differentiate between good sensors and bad sensors of the environmental stimuli.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Cell populations are characterized by heterogeneity in cell state variables that is responsible for important phenotypic differences including sensitivity to drugs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>, response to chemotactic signals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>, and following proliferation cues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>. Therefore, it is reasonable to expect that cells’ ability to sense their environment depends on their state and is therefore variable across cells in a population. To quantify this heterogeneity, here, we developed a novel information theoretic framework that takes as input easily measurable single cell data and models of signaling networks to quantify the distribution <italic>p</italic><sub>CeeMI</sub> (<italic>I</italic>) of single cell sensing abilities. Our framework also quantifies the joint distribution <italic>p</italic><sub>CeeMI</sub> (<italic>I, χ</italic>) of cell specific sensing ability and any biochemical cell state variable. Importantly, using two growth factor pathways, we showed that individual cells in real cell populations were much better at sensing their environment compared to what is implied by the traditional estimate of channel capacities of signaling networks.</p>
<p>Our framework will be useful in identifying bottlenecks in signal transduction. Many cellular phenotypes such as chemotaxis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup> and cell proliferation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup> exhibit a weak correlation between cellular outputs (e.g., directional alignment with chemical gradients) with the input (e.g., gradient strength), resulting in a low channel capacity even for individual cells. In such cases, it is important to understand where exactly along the information transduction pathway is the information about the gradient is lost. If traditional calculations are pursued, for example, for movement of mammalian cells under EGF gradients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>, one may conclude that the information loss likely happens right at the receptor level (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>). In contrast, CeeMI will allow us to disentangle the effect of cell state heterogeneity and noisy cellular response to precisely pinpoint intracellular signaling nodes that are responsible for signal corruption.</p>
<p>A limitation of the current approach is the assumption that cell state variables remain constant over the time scale of typical environmental fluctuations. While many cell state variables remain constant over the life spans of cells and beyond<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>, it is likely that state changes may occur within the lifespan of a cell<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>. These dynamical changes can be accommodated easily in the framework. Here, instead of fixing the cell state variables <bold><italic>θ</italic></bold>, we can treat them as initial conditions and propagate them stochastically with their own dynamics. In the limit of very fast dynamics where individual cells rapidly transition cell states, our framework will agree with traditional cell state agnostic estimates of the channel capacity. In contrast, if the cell state dynamics are slow, our framework highlights differences between cells in the population.</p>
<p>In summary, we showed that like other phenotypes, the ability to sense the environment is itself heterogeneously distributed in a cell population. Moreover, we also showed that mammalian cells appear to be significantly better at sensing their environment than what traditional mutual information calculation suggests. Finally, we showed that we could identify cell state variables that made some cells better sensors compared to others. We believe that CeeMI will be an important framework in quantifying fidelity of input/output relationships in heterogeneous cell populations.</p>

<p>In this <bold>valuable</bold> paper, the authors use an existing theoretical framework relying on information theory and maximum entropy inference in order to quantify how much information single cells can carry, taking into account their internal state. They reanalyze experimental data in this light. Despite some limitations of the data, the study <bold>convincingly</bold> highlights the difference between single-cell and population channel capacities. This result should be of interest to the quantitative biology community, as it contributes to explaining why channel capacities are apparently low in cells.</p>

<p>The manuscript by Goetz et al. takes a new perspective on sensory information processing in cells. In contrast to previous studies, which have used population data to build a response distribution and which estimate sensory information at about 1 bit, this work defines sensory information at the single cell level. To do so, the authors take two approaches. First, they estimate single cells' response distributions to various input levels from time-series data directly. Second, they infer these single-cell response distributions from the population data by assuming a biochemical model and extracting the cells' parameters with a maximum-entropy approach. In either case, they find, for two experimental examples, that single-cell sensory information is much higher than 1 bit, and that the reduction to 1 bit at the population level is due to the fact that cells' response functions are so different from each other. Finally, the authors identify examples of measurable cell properties that do or do not correlate with single-cell sensory information.</p>
<p>The work brings an important and distinct new insight to a research direction that generated strong interest about a decade ago: measuring sensory information in cells and understanding why it is so low. The manuscript is clear, the results are compelling, and the conclusions are well supported by the findings. Several contributions should be of interest to the quantitative biology community (e.g., the demonstration that single cells' sensory information is considerably larger than previously implied, and the approach of inferring single-cell data from population data with the help of a model and a maximum-entropy assumption).</p>

<p>In this paper the authors present an existing information theoretic framework to assess the ability of single cells to encode external signals sensed through membrane receptors.</p>
<p>The main point is to distinguish actual noise in the signaling pathway from cell-cell variability, which could be due to differences in their phenotypic state, and to formalize this difference using information theory.</p>
<p>After correcting for this cellular variability, the authors find that cells may encode more information than one would estimate from ignoring it, which is expected. The authors show this using simple models of different complexities, and also by analyzing an imaging dataset of the IGF/FoxO pathway.</p>
<p>The implications of the work are limited because the analysed data is not rich enough to draw clear conclusions. Specifically,</p>
<p>
- the authors do not distinguish what could be methodological noise inherent to microscopy techniques (segmentation etc), and actual intrinsic cell state. It's not clear that cell-cell variability in the analyzed dataset is not just a constant offset or normalization factor. Other authors (e.g. Gregor et al Cell 130, 153-164) have re-centered and re-normalized their data before further analysis, which is more or less equivalent to the idea of the conditional information in the sense that it aims to correct for this experimental noise.</p>
<p>
- in the experiment, each condition is shown only once and sequentially. This means that the reproducibility of the response upon repeated exposures in a single cell was not tested, casting doubt on the estimate of the response fidelity (estimated as the variance over time in a single response).</p>
<p>
- another dataset on the EGF/EGFR pathway is analyzed, but no conclusion can be drawn from it because single-cell information cannot be directly estimated from it. The authors instead use a maximum-entropy Ansatz, which cannot be validated for lack of data.</p>

<p>Goetz, Akl and Dixit investigated the heterogeneity in the fidelity of sensing the environment by individual cells in a population using computational modeling and analysis of experimental data for two important and well-studied mammalian signaling pathways: (insulin-like growth factor) IGF/FoxO and (epidermal growth factor) EFG/EFGR mammalian pathways. They quantified this heterogeneity using the conditional mutual information between the input (eg. level of IGF) and output (eg. level of FoxO in the nucleus), conditioned on the &quot;state&quot; variables which characterize the signaling pathway (such as abundances of key proteins, reaction rates, etc.) First, using a toy stochastic model of a receptor-ligand system - which constitutes the first step of both signaling pathways - they constructed the population average of the mutual information conditioned on the number of receptors and maximized over the input distribution and showed that it is always greater than or equal to the usual or &quot;cell state agnostic&quot; channel capacity. They constructed the probability distribution of cell state dependent mutual information for the two pathways, demonstrating agreement with experimental data in the case of the IGF/FoxO pathway using previously published data. Finally, for the IGF/FoxO pathway, they found the joint distribution of the cell state dependent mutual information and two experimentally accessible state variables: the response range of FoxO and total nuclear FoxO level prior to IGF stimulation. In both cases, the data approximately follow the contour lines of the joint distribution. Interestingly, high nuclear FoxO levels, and therefore lower associated noise in the number of output readout molecules, is not correlated with higher cell state dependent mutual information, as one might expect. This paper contributes to the vibrant body of work on information theoretic characterization of biochemical signaling pathways, using the distribution of cell state dependent mutual information as a metric to highlight the importance of heterogeneity in cell populations. The authors suggest that this metric can be used to infer &quot;bottlenecks&quot; in information transfer in signaling networks, where certain cell state variables have a lower joint distribution with the cell state dependent mutual information.</p>
<p>The utility of a metric based on the conditional mutual information to quantify fidelity of sensing and its heterogeneity (distribution) in a cell population is supported in the comparison with data. Some aspects of the analysis and claims in the main body of the paper and SI need to be clarified and extended.</p>
<p>1. The authors use their previously published (Ref. 32) maximum-entropy based method to extract the probability distribution of cell state variables, which is needed to construct their main result, namely p_CeeMI (I). The salient features of their method, and how it compares with other similar methods of parameter inference should be summarized in the section with this title. In SI 3.3, the Lagrangian, L, and Rm should be defined.</p>
<p>2. Throughout the text, the authors refer to &quot;low&quot; and &quot;high&quot; values of the channel capacity. For example, a value of 1-1.5 bits is claimed to be &quot;low&quot;. The authors need to clarify the context in which this value is low: In some physically realistic cases, the signaling network may need to simply distinguish between the present or absence of a ligand, in which case this value would not be low.</p>
<p>3. Related to (2), the authors should comment on why in Fig. 3A, I_Cee=3. Importantly, where does the fact that the network is able to distinguish between 23 ligand levels come from? Is this related to the choice (and binning) of the input ligand distribution (described in the SI)?</p>
<p>4. The authors should justify the choice of the gamma distribution in a number of cases (eg. distribution of ligand, distribution cell state parameters, such as number of receptors, receptor degradation rate, etc.).</p>
<p>5. Referring to SI Section 2, it is stated that the probability of the response (receptor binding occupancy) conditioned on the input ligand concentration and number of receptors is a Poisson distribution. Indeed this is nicely demonstrated in Fig. S2. Therefore it is the coefficient of variation (std/mean) that decreases with increasing R0, not the noise (which is strictly the standard deviation) as stated in the paper.</p>
<p>6. In addition to explicitly stating what the input (IGF level) and the output (nuclear GFP-tagged FoxO level) are, it would be helpful if it is also stated what is the vector of state variables, theta, corresponding to the schematic diagram in Fig. 2C.</p>
<p>7. Related to Fig. 2C, the statement in the caption: &quot;Phosphorylated Akt leads to phosphorylation of FoxO which effectively shuttles it out of the nucleus.&quot; needs clarification: From the figure, it appears that pFoxO does not cross the nuclear membrane, in which case it would be less confusing to say that phosphorylation prevents reentry of FoxO into the nucleus.</p>
<p>8. The explanations for Fig. 2D, E and insets are sparse and therefore not clear. The authors should expand on what is meant by model and experimental I(theta). What is CC input dose? Also in Fig. 2E, the overlap between the blue and pink histograms means that the value of the blue histogram for the final bin - and therefore agreement or lack thereof with the experimental result - is not visible. Also, the significance of the values 3.25 bits and 3 bits in these plots should be discussed in connection with the input distributions.</p>
<p>9. While the joint distribution of the cell state dependent mutual information and various biochemical parameters is given in Fig. S7, there is no explanation of what these results mean, either in the SI or main text. Related to this, while a central claim of the work is that establishing this joint distribution will allow determination of cell state variables that differentiate between high and low fidelity sensing, this claim would be stronger with more discussion of Figs. 3 and S7.</p>
<p>10. The related central claim that cell state dependent mutual information leads to higher fidelity sensing at the population level would be made stronger if it can be demonstrated that in the limit of rapidly varying cell state variables, the I_CSA is retrieved.</p>
