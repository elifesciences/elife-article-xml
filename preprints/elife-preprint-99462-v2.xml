<title>Abstract</title><p>Accumulation of amyloid Î² (AÎ²) peptides and hyperphosphorylated tau proteins in the hippocampus triggers cognitive memory decline in Alzheimerâs disease (AD). The incidence and mortality of sporadic AD were tightly associated with diabetes and hyperlipidemia, while the exact linked molecular is uncertain. Here, we reported that serum Kallistatin concentrations were meaningfully higher in AD patients, with a higher concentration of fasting blood glucose and triglyceride. In addition, the constructed Kallistatin-transgenic (KAL-TG) mice defined its cognitive memory impairment phenotype and lower LTP in hippocampal CA1 neurons accompanied by increased AÎ² deposition and tau phosphorylation. Mechanistically, Kallistatin could directly bind to the Notch1 receptor and thereby upregulate BACE1 expression by inhibiting PPARÎ³ signaling, resulting in AÎ² cleavage and production. Besides, Kallistatin could promote the phosphorylation of tau by activating GSK-3Î². Fenofibrate, a hypolipidemic drug, could alleviate cognitive memory impairment by down-regulating AÎ² and tau phosphorylation of KAL-TG mice. Collectively, our data clarified a novel mechanism for AÎ² accumulation and tau protein hyperphosphorylation regulation by Kallistatin, which might play a crucial role in linking metabolic syndromes and cognitive memory deterioration, and suggested that fenofibrate might have the potential for treating metabolism-related AD.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Alzheimerâs disease (AD), the most prevalent irreversible neurodegenerative disorder associated with dementia in elderly individuals, is marked by a gradual decline in cognitive memory. Pathologically, AD is identified by the presence of extracellular amyloid-Î² (AÎ²) plaques and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. The AÎ² cascade and tau protein hyperphosphorylation are the two primary hypotheses concerning AD. According to the AÎ² cascade hypothesis, the excessive production of AÎ² disrupts normal cellular functions, leading to synaptic dysfunction, neurodegeneration, tau hyperphosphorylation, and neuroinflammation, which ultimately result in memory impairment in individuals with AD and dementia <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. AÎ² peptides are derived from the sequential cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP) by Î²-secretase (Î²-site APP cleaving enzyme 1, BACE1) and Î³-secretase, thus making this cleavage process significant in AD pathology <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. BACE1 is considered a highly promising therapeutic target. Several potent BACE1 inhibitors have progressed to advanced stages in clinical trials, emphasizing the role of BACE1 in AÎ² production <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>. Tau, a microtubule-associated protein, naturally occurs in axons and regulates microtubule dynamics and axonal transport <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. In AD, tau undergoes a multistep transformation from a natively unfolded monomer to large aggregated forms, such as NFTs, another defining feature of AD <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. Glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK3) is a key kinase involved in the initial steps of tau phosphorylation, with Wnt signaling being crucial in activating GSK-3Î² and GSK-3Î²-mediated tau phosphorylation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>. The physiological mechanisms underlying their interaction remain poorly understood.</p>
<p>There is a close relationship between metabolic disorders and cognitive impairment across the AD spectrum <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. Nearly 95% of AD patients are categorized as sporadic patients, whose increasing incidence and mortality are strongly associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), obesity, and hyperlipidemia <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. About 37% of comorbidities between AD and diabetes have been reported in the Alzheimerâs Association Report <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. As a result of the strong association and shared mechanism between AD and T2DM, AD has been termed âtype 3 diabetesâ by some researchers <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>. Several studies have demonstrated that diabetes confers a 1.6-fold increased risk of developing dementia <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>. Similarly, central obesity and high body mass index (BMI) during middle age are associated with an about 3.5-fold increased risk of dementia later in life <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>. Therefore, controlling blood glucose and lipids is expected to be a strategy for preventing or moderating cognitive decline during aging. Nevertheless, the exact link and key associated regulators between metabolic abnormalities and AD are still unclear.</p>
<p>Kallistatin is a serine proteinase inhibitor previously identified as a tissue kallikrein-binding protein <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>. It is produced predominantly in the liver and is widely expressed in body tissues, where it has antiangiogenic, antifibrotic, antioxidative stress, and antitumor effects <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>. Furthermore, Kallistatin was found to be increased in patients with obesity, prediabetes, and diabetes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>. The concentration of Kallistatin was positively correlated with the triglyceride glucose index <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>, which was proven to be an independent risk factor for dementia <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>. In addition, our previous study revealed that the concentration of serum Kallistatin in T2DM patients was significantly increased and further revealed that Kallistatin suppressed wound healing in T2DM patients by promoting local inflammation, which suggested that Kallistatin plays a critical role in the progression of T2DM <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>. Furthermore, our recent research revealed that Kallistatin can cause memory and cognitive dysfunction by disrupting the glutamate-glutamine cycle<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>To explore the relationships among T2DM, AD and Kallistatin, we constructed Kallistatin transgenic (KAL-TG) mice to explore whether Kallistatin could cause cognitive impairment through the upregulation of AÎ² production. Taken together, our results suggest that a novel regulatory mechanism of AÎ² production and tau protein hyperphosphorylation by Kallistatin is involved in the progression of metabolic abnormality-related AD.</p>

<title>Kallistatin increases in AD patients and AD model mice</title>
<p>To explore the relevance of AD in T2DM, a GAD disease enrichment analysis was initially conducted on differentially expressed genes in neurons of T2DM patients and normal controls, revealing a close relationship between AD and T2DM (GSE161355) (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1A</xref>). Additionally, PFAM analysis using the DAVID database identified enrichment of the Serpin family protein domain (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1B</xref>) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://david.ncifcrf.gov/">https://david.ncifcrf.gov/</ext-link>). Our previous studies revealed that Kallistatin (serpin family a member 4) was elevated in the serum of T2DM patients and was associated with an adverse prognosis of diabetes complications <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup>. We collected 11 serum samples from dementia patients at Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hospital and reported that the concentration of Kallistatin was greater than that in normal controls<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>. In this study, 56 AD patients and 61 healthy controls were enrolled from four hospitals in Guangdong Province to further investigate the potential relevance of Kallistatin and AD. The clinical and biochemical characteristics of the participants are provided in Tables S1 and S2. In addition, the serum Kallistatin (12.78 Â±2.80 Î¼g/mL) content in patients with AD was greater than that in normal controls (9.78 Â±1.93 Î¼g/mL) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). Similarly, fasting blood glucose (FBG) and triglyceride (TG) levels were greater in AD patients than in healthy controls (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>). We further grouped all the AD patients according to diabetes status and found that the Kallistatin (13.79 Â±3.05 Î¼g/mL) and TG contents were further elevated in AD patients with diabetes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C-D</xref>). Similarly, Kallistatin expression was increased in the hippocampus of the AD model mouse SAMP8 compared with that in the control mouse SAMR1 (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1C-D</xref>). Taken together, these results indicate that the Kallistatin concentration is increased in metabolic abnormality-related AD patients.</p>

<title>Kallistatin impairs cognitive memory in mice</title>
<p>The above experiments demonstrated that Kallistatin was increased in AD patients and AD model mice. We subsequently generated KAL-TG mice and assessed their behavioral performance through the Morris water maze (MWM) and Y maze tests. Notably, the latency to escape the platform was longer, and the number of platform crossings, percentage of time spent, and spontaneous alternation were significantly lower in KAL-TG mice than in age-matched WT mice (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E-I</xref>). Furthermore, long-term potentiation (LTP) was measured using whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings of CA1 neurons in acute hippocampal slices from KAL-TG and WT mice to assess changes in hippocampal synapses. The LTP in KAL-TG mice was significantly reduced compared to that in WT mice (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1J</xref>). These results showed that Kallistatin could impair cognitive memory in mice.</p>

Predictably, the plaque density and tau phosphorylation in KAL-TG mice were much greater than those in age-matched WT mice (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A-C</xref>, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3A-D</xref>). Consistent with these results, ELISA detection of the AÎ²42 content in hippocampal tissue revealed that AÎ² production was extraordinarily increased in KAL-TG mice compared with WT mice (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>). These results suggested that Kallistatin promoted AÎ² deposition and tau phosphorylation.</p>

<title>Kallistatin positively regulates AÎ² generation by promoting Î²-secretase rather than Î³-secretase</title>
<p>Western blot and ELISA analyses revealed that the AÎ² levels in primary hippocampal neurons (immunofluorescence identified with the neural marker MAP2, <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2G</xref>) infected with the Kallistatin adenovirus were greater than those in the control groups (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E-G</xref>), as were those in the HT22 cells (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2A-C</xref>).

<title>Mechanism summary</title>
<p>In patients with metabolic abnormality-related AD, the concentration of Kallistatin is elevated, which could increase AÎ² deposition through the Notch1/HES1/PPARÎ³/BACE1 pathway and induce tau hyperphosphorylation by activating GSK-3Î².

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study demonstrated that Kallistatin is a novel regulator of amyloid-Î² plaque accumulation, tau protein hyperphosphorylation, and metabolic abnormality-related cognitive memory impairment. It was shown that Kallistatin levels were increased in the serum of patients with AD and diabetes-related AD, as well as in the hippocampus of AD model mice. Additionally, the KAL-TG mice exhibited cognitive memory impairment and lower LTP in hippocampal CA1 neurons, along with increased AÎ² deposition and tau phosphorylation. Mechanistically, Kallistatin transcriptionally upregulates BACE1 expression by suppressing the transcriptional repressor PPARÎ³, leading to AÎ² cleavage and production. Most importantly, our studies revealed that Kallistatin could bind directly to the Notch1 receptor and activate the Notch1/HES1 pathway, causing a decrease in PPARÎ³, overproduction of BACE1, and increased AÎ²42 generation. Moreover, Kallistatin can induce tau phosphorylation by activating GSK-3Î², which results from the inhibition of LRP6. Finally, prolonged stimulation with high concentrations of Kallistatin impaired cognitive memory in mice. Finally, the hypolipidemic drug fenofibrate decreased AÎ² expression, tau phosphorylation, and the serum Kallistatin level in KAL-TG mice, alleviating memory and cognitive impairment. For the first time, these observations establish an association between high Kallistatin levels and metabolic abnormality-related AD and provide a new drug candidate (fenofibrate) for AD patients with metabolic syndromes.</p>
<p>Increasing evidence suggests that diabetes mellitus and AD are closely linked. About 80% of AD patients are insulin resistant or have T2DM <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref></sup>; additionally, T2DM patients have a higher risk of up to 73% dementia than healthy controls do <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>. In line with these observations, the process of cognitive decline in T2DM patients appears to begin in the prediabetic phase of insulin resistance <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref></sup>. A GAD disease enrichment analysis of differentially expressed genes in the neurons of T2DM patients and normal controls revealed a close relationship between AD and T2DM. Additionally, PFAM analysis identified an enrichment of the Serpin family protein domain (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1A</xref>, B). We and other researchers reported that the level of Kallistatin (which belongs to the serpin family) was increased in T2DM patients <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>. Although the relationship between Kallistatin and AD has not been reported to date, we speculate that Kallistatin might be a critical molecule that could establish a relationship between Alzheimerâs disease and diabetes. Our data indicated that AD patients exhibit metabolic disorders and elevated Kallistatin levels (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A-D</xref>, <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">S1C-D</xref>). Additionally, KAL-TG mice showed impaired memory, cognitive function, and synaptic plasticity (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E-J</xref>). These results suggest that Kallistatin represents a novel connection between AD and diabetes.</p>
<p>A hallmark of AD is the aggregation of AÎ² into amyloid plaques and tau phosphorylation in patientsâ brains. AÎ², a small peptide with a high propensity to form aggregates, is widely believed to be central and initial to the pathogenesis of this disease <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref></sup>. Correspondingly, it was discovered that Kallistatin could lead to AÎ² overproduction through the Notch1/HES1/PPARÎ³/BACE1 signaling pathway. GSK-3Î², a vital kinase that regulates the process of tau phosphorylation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref></sup>, can be activated by inhibiting the Wnt signaling pathway. Kallistatin has been identified as a competitive inhibitor of LRP6, the Wnt receptor <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref></sup>. Consistent with previous reports, Kallistatin increased tau phosphorylation by activating GSK-3Î². It was demonstrated for the first time that Kallistatin promoted AD by increasing AÎ² production and tau phosphorylation in the central nervous system.</p>
<p>Previous studies have shown that Notch signaling is closely related to AD. For example, a NOTCH mutation was reported to cause AD-like pathology <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref></sup>. In addition, the level of Notch1 was found to be increased in AD patients <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref></sup>. In addition, the Notch1/HES1 signaling pathway has been reported to suppress the expression of PPARÎ³ <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref></sup>. Our previous studies demonstrated that Kallistatin can activate Notch1 signaling <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>. Consequently, we detected Notch1 in our animal and cell models. Indeed, Notch1 was upregulated by Kallistatin (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>, <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">S4</xref>), as was AÎ² deposition. Notch signaling is initiated by receptor-ligand interactions at the cell surface. In mammals, there are five ligands encoded by JAG1, JAG2, DLL1, DLL3, and DLL4 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref></sup>. Here, our results revealed that Kallistatin could activate Notch1 by binding directly to it, indicating that Kallistatin is a new ligand of the Notch1 receptor.</p>
<p>The treatment of AD has always been a prominent and challenging issue in neurology. Multiple strategies have been proposed to reduce the pathogenicity of AÎ² and tau. Unfortunately, several AÎ²-targeted therapies tested in phase III clinical trials have failed to slow cognitive decline, although they can effectively reduce the AÎ² load <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref></sup>. BACE1 inhibitors have not only failed to improve the cognitive function of AD patients but have also resulted in clinical deterioration and liver function impairment <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">73</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">74</xref></sup>. Two possible reasons for the failure of clinical trials with BACE1 inhibitors are: first, the reduction in BACE1 activity could lead to the accumulation of full-length APP <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">75</xref></sup>; second, the size of the BACE1 active site is relatively large, and the use of a small molecule may not be sufficient to occupy the active site <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">76</xref></sup>. Consequently, synaptic damage caused by BACE1 inhibitors or their insufficient effect may lead to the failure of clinical trials. Therapeutic strategies targeting tau include tau aggregation blockers (TRx0014, TRx0237), antibody vaccine therapy (e.g., RO7105705, BIIB092), the inhibition of tau phosphorylation (Anavex2-73), and the use of microtubule stabilizers (Anavex2-73) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">77</xref></sup>. Some of these drugs have been partially discontinued, while others are still undergoing clinical testing and have shown protective benefits. Nonetheless, several obstacles remain to the commercialization of tau treatments when they reach maturity.</p>
<p>Because of the failure of clinical trials, some researchers have proposed alternative options for AD therapeutics to address modifiable risk factors for the development of AD, such as type 2 diabetes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">78</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">79</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">80</xref></sup>. Previous studies revealed that Kallistatin is a multifunctional protein strongly associated with diabetes and that a Kallistatin neutralizing antibody improves diabetic wound healing <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup>. This study demonstrated that Kallistatin induced memory-related cognitive dysfunction by promoting AÎ² deposition and tau phosphorylation. Thus, it is speculated that increased Kallistatin could be a promising candidate for T2DM-related AD therapy. PPARÎ³ is a ligand-activated transcription factor and a master modulator of glucose and lipid metabolism, organelle differentiation, and inflammation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">81</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">82</xref></sup>. Growing evidence revealed that PPARÎ³ agonists (rosiglitazone) could rescue memory impairment of AD model mice <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">83</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">84</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">85</xref></sup>. In clinical trials, it is controversial whether rosiglitazone has a protective effect on memory cognitive function <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">86</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">87</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">88</xref></sup>. In this study, although AÎ² expression had a downward trend, the memory and cognition of KAL-TG mice were unchanged after treatment with rosiglitazone for a month (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig.8</xref>). This might be caused by insufficient treatment time and the unchanged Kallistatin level.</p>
<p>Fenofibrate is a fibric acid derivative for clinically lowering blood lipids, mainly triglycerides <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">89</xref></sup>. Studies showed that fenofibrate could prevent memory disturbances, maintain hippocampal neurogenesis, and protect against Parkinsonâs disease (PD) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">90</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">91</xref></sup>. Specifically, fenofibrate has a neuroprotective effect on memory impairment induced by AÎ² through targeting Î±- and Î²-secretase <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c92">92</xref></sup>. Recently, our study proved that the fenofibrate could repair the disrupted glutamine-glutamate cycle by upregulating glutamine synthetase, while there is currently no fenofibrate treatment of AD in clinical trials<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>. In this study, we proved fenofibrate was beneficial for memory and cognitive impairment of KAL-TG mice. In addition, AÎ², BACE1, phosphorylated tau, and serum Kallistatin level of KAL-TG mice could be downregulated after the treatment of fenofibrate. All of these suggested that fenofibrate might be helpful for metabolic abnormalities-related AD patients. Therefore, fenofibrate administration in patients with metabolic syndrome play an early role in preventing and treating AD.</p>
<p>In summary, we affirmed that Kallistatin concentrations were increased in diabetes-related AD patients. In addition, our study demonstrated for the first time that Kallistatin positively regulated AÎ²42 through Notch1/HES1/PPARÎ³/BACE1, and increased phosphorylated tau through inhibition of the Wnt signaling pathway. Kallistatin might play a crucial role in linking diabetes and cognitive memory deterioration. Moreover, fenofibrate could decrease the serum Kallistatin level, BACE1, AÎ², and phosphorylated tau of KAL-TG mice, leading to alleviating memory and cognitive impairment. These findings might provide new insight into AD and possibly other neurodegenerative disorders.</p>

<title>Experimental Animals and Protocols</title>
<p>All animal experiment procedures were carried out in an environment without specific pathogens (Specific pathogen free, SPF) with the approval of the Animal Care and Use Committee of Sun Yat-sen University (approval ID: SYXK 2015-0107). The wild type mice (WT, C57BL/6) were purchased from the Animal Center of Guangdong Province (Production license No.: SCXK 2013-0002, Guangzhou, China). The SAMR1 and SAMP8 mice (7 months old) were purchased from Tianjin University of Traditional Chinese Medicine (Tianjin, China). Kallistatin transgenic mice (KAL-TG) were C57BL/6 strain provided by Dr. Jianxing Ma (University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>. The KAL-TG mice genotype was identified by PCR technology (forward primer: 5â-AGGGAAG-ATTGTGGATTTGG-3â, reverse primer: 5â-ATGAAGATACCAGTGATGCTC-3â). KAL-TG mice aged 6 months were randomly divided into three groups: control group (KAL-TG), fenofibrate-treated group (KAL-TG-Feno, 0.3 g/kg/d), and rosiglitazone-treated group (KAL-TG-RSG, 0.005 g/kg/d). Fenofibrate (Sigma-Aldrich, cat. no. F6020) and rosiglitazone (Selleck, cat. no. S2556) were administered to mice by oral gavage. In three groups, the serum Kallistatin were examined in the 0 week and 4 week after drug treatment from the blood taken from mouse orbit. In addition, the Morris water maze and Y-maze test were performed one week after the second blood collection.</p>

<sec id="s4d">
<title>Morris water maze (MWM)</title>
<p>The KAL-TG and WT mice were employed for the Morris water maze test including the behavioral test, latency experiment (for 6 days), and the probe test (the 7th day). In addition, the MWM was performed as described previously <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>. Mice were brought into the testing room and handled for 1 day before the training experiment. In the 6-day training experiment, each mouse was trained with four daily trials. The mice facing the wall were placed into the maze, exploring the maze from different directions (east, south, west, and north). This trial was completed as soon as the mouse found the platform, or 90 s elapsed. If the mice could discover and climb the submerged platform within 90 s, the system would automatically record the latency time and path immediately, and then the mouse was guided to and placed on the submerged platform for extra 20 s. On day 7, the platform was removed, and a probe test was performed to examine the strength and integrity of the animal spatial memory 24 h after the last testing trial. During the probe test, the mice were gently brought into the water from the fixed monitoring point, and the mice were allowed to swim for 90 s without the platform. Finally, all of the measured behavioral parameters were analyzed using SMART software.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4e">
<title>Y-maze test</title>
<p>A Y maze test was performed to assess the miceâs spatial memory. The Y maze was separated by 120Â°, consisting of three identical arms (30 cm long, 7 cm wide, and 15 cm high) made of blue PVC. The mice were placed first in one of the arms, and over the next 10 minutes, the sequence and number of their entry into the three arms were monitored. An alternation is defined when a mouse visits three straight arms (namely, ABC, BCA, or CAB, but not ABA, BAB, or CAC). Spontaneous alternation (%)=[(number of alternations)/(total number of armsâ2)]Ã100.</p>

<title>Electrophysiology</title>
<p>Hippocampal slices (300-400 Î¼m) from KAL-TG and WT mice were cut as described <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>. Coronal slices from hippocampus (400 Î¼m thick) were prepared from different age groups KAL-TG mice and their WT littermates using a tissue slicer (Vibratome 3000; Vibratome) in ice-cold dissection buffer containing the following (in mM): 212.7 sucrose, 3 KCl, 1.25 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 3 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 26 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, and 10 dextrose, bubbled with 95% O<sub>2</sub>/5% CO<sub>2</sub>. The slices were immediately transferred to ACSF at 35 Â°C for 30 min before recordings. The recipe of ACSF was similar to the dissection buffer, except that sucrose was replaced with 124 mM NaCl, and the concentrations of MgCl<sub>2</sub> and CaCl<sub>2</sub> were changed to 1 mM and 2 mM, respectively. All recordings were performed at 28-30 Â°C. Pyramidal cells in CA1 areas were identified visually under infrared differential interference contrast optics based on their pyramidal somata and prominent apical dendrites. Whole-cell was performed using an Integrated Patch-Clamp Amplifier (Sutter Instrument, Novato, CA, USA) controlled by Igor 7 software (WaveMetrics, Portland, OR, USA) filtered at 5 kHz and sampled at 20 kHz. Igor 7 software was also used for acquisition and analysis. Only cells with series resistance &lt;20 Mâ¦ and input resistance &gt;100 Mâ¦ were studied. Cells were excluded if input resistance changed &gt;15% or series resistance changed &gt;10% over the experiment. A concentric bipolar stimulating electrode with a tip diameter of 125 Î¼m (FHC) was placed in the stratum radiatum. The recording and stimulating electrode distances were kept at 50-100 Î¼m. Patch pipettes (2-4Mâ¦) were filled with the internal solution consisting of the following (in mM): 120 Cs-methylsulfonate, 10 Na-phosphocreatine, 10 HEPES, 4 ATP, 5 lidocaine N-ethyl bromide (QX-314), 0.5 GTP; the pH of the solution was 7.2â7.3, and the osmolarity was 270-285 mOsm.</p>
<p>To induce LTP, a pairing protocol was applied. In brief, conditioning stimulation consisted of 360 pulses at 2 Hz paired with continuous postsynaptic depolarization (180 s) to 0 mV. 50 Î¼M picrotoxin was added to the recording bath to suppress excessive polysynaptic activity, and the concentration of Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Mg<sup>2+</sup> was elevated to 4 mM to reduce the recruitment of polysynaptic responses. A test pulse was delivered at 0.067 Hz to monitor baseline amplitude for 10 min before and 30 min following paired stimulation. To calculate LTP, the EPSC amplitude was normalized to the mean baseline amplitude during 10 min baseline. Potentiation was defined as the mean normalized EPSC amplitude 25â40 min after paired stimulation.</p>

<title>ELISA</title>
<p>To quantify serum Kallistatin, the collected samples were centrifuged at 4 Â°C for 10min at 5000 rpm. It was detected using the KBP ELISA kit (#DY1669, R&amp;D systems, MN, USA) as per the instructions of the manufacturer. The levels of AÎ²42 in brain tissue produced from mouse primary neuron cells and HT22 cells were measured with a mouse AÎ²42 Elisa Kit (27721, IBL, Germany). To measure AÎ²42 in brain tissue, 0.05 g of mouse brain tissues were weighed and homogenized using 2ml PBS with a protease inhibitor (cocktail, IKM1020, Solarbio). After centrifugalization at 4 Â°C for 30 min at 12000 g, the extractsâ supernatants were analyzed using the ELISA method after total protein quantification. To quantify levels of AÎ²42 produced from primary neuron cells, the cell supernatants were ultrafiltrated with an Ultrafiltration tube (4-kD Millipore), centrifugalization, and testing. Cell homogenate was prepared in 1ml PBS with cocktail and quantified using the BCA method before being measured by ELISA.</p>

<title>Primary culture of hippocampal neurons</title>
<p>Primary neurons were obtained from the hippocampus of C57/BL6J mice at age 1-3 days. Before culturing, the newborn pup was euthanized and dipped into 70% ethanol for 3 min. First, the infant pup hippocampus was isolated with eye tweezers observed under the stereomicroscope, and excess soft tissue was removed. Second, hippocampal tissue in PBS buffer was cut up with scissors gently and blown with a 1ml pipette until it was not visible. Next, the cell suspension was transferred to a 15ml centrifuge tube and centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 5 min at room temperature. Cell precipitation was suspended and cultured with 2-3mL primary neural stem cell (NSC) suspension (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 21103049) in a 37 Â°C, 5% CO<sub>2</sub> cell incubator for 3 days, changing half medium every 2 days. After 7 days, the cell suspension was transferred to a 15ml centrifuge tube, centrifuged, and recultured with neurobasal, 10%FBS, 1:50 B27(Thermo Fisher Scientific, A3582801), and 1:100 bFGF (Thermo Fisher Scientific, #RP-8626). One day later, the medium was changed to neurobasal (2%FBS, 1:50 B27, and 1:100 bFGF), culturing for 21 more days. The immunofluorescence technique was used with the neuron-specific marker (MAP2, #4542, Cell Signaling Technology, Boston, USA) to determine the purity of neurons.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Qi and colleagues investigated the role of Kallistatin pathway in increasing hippocampal amyloid-Î² plaques accumulation and tau hyperpholphorylation in Alzheimer's disease, linking the increased Kallistatin level in diabetic patients with a higher risk of Alzheimer's disease development. A Kallistatin overexpressing animal model was utilized, and memory impairment was assessed using Morris water maze and Y-maze. Kallistatin-related pathway protein levels were measured in the hippocampus, and phenotypes were rescued using fenofibrate and rosiglitazone. The current study provides evidence of a novel molecular mechanism linking diabetes and Alzheimer's disease, and suggests the potential use of fenofibrate to alleviate memory impairment. However, several issues need to be addressed before further consideration.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The finding of this study is novel. The finding will have great impacts on diabetes and AD research. The studies were well conducted, and results convincing.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) The mechanism by which fenofibrate rescues memory loss in Kallistatin-transgenic mice is unclear. As a PPARÎ± agonist, does fenofibrate target the Kallistatin pathway directly or indirectly? Please provide discussion based on literature supporting either possibility.</p>
<p>
(2) The current study exclusively investigated hippocampus. What about other cognitive memory-related regions, such as prefrontal cortex? Including data from these regions or discussing the possibility of their involvement could provide a more comprehensive understanding of the role of Kallistatin in memory impairment.</p>
<p>
(3) Fenofibrate rescued phenotypes in Kallistatin-transgenic mice while rosiglitazone, a PPARÎ± agonist, did not. This result contradicts the manuscript's emphasis on a PPARÎ±-associated mechanism. Please address this inconsistency.</p>
<p>
(4) Most of the immunohistochemistry images are unclear. Inserts have similar magnification to the original representative images, making judgments difficult. Please provide larger inserts with higher resolution.</p>
<p>
(5) The immunohistochemistry images in different figures were taken from different hippocampal subregions with different magnifications. Please maintain consistency, or explain why CA1, CA3 or DG was analyzed in each experiment.</p>
<p>
(6) Figure 5B is missing a title. Please add a title to maintain consistency with other graphs.</p>
<p>
(7) Please list statistical methods used in the figure legends, such as t-test or One way ANOVA with post-hoc tests.</p>
<p>Comments on revisions:</p>
<p>The authors have addressed the issues raised from the review. The manuscript has been revised accordingly.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The study links Alzheimer's disease (AD) with metabolic disorders through elevated Kallistatin levels in AD patients. Kallistatin-overexpressing mice show cognitive decline, increased AÎ² and tau pathology, and impaired hippocampal function. Mechanistically, Kallistatin enhances AÎ² production via Notch1 and promotes tau phosphorylation through GSK-3Î² activation. Fenofibrate improves cognitive deficits by reducing AÎ² and tau phosphorylation in these mice, suggesting therapeutic potential in AD linked to metabolic syndromes.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This study presents a novel insights into Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis and provides strong evidences about the mechanistic roles of Kallistatin and the therapeutic potential of fenofibrate in AD.</p>
<p>It was suggested that Kallistatin is primarily produced by the liver. The study demonstrates increased Kallistatin levels in the hippocampus tissue of AD mice. They also found that Kallistatin is also increased in the liver of AD mice.</p>
<p>They also showed that Kallistatin directly binds to Notch1 and contributes to the activation of the Noch1-HES1 signaling pathway</p>

They identified that Kallistatin is a key player that mediates AÎ² accumulation and tau hyperphosphorylation in AD.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This manuscript not only provides novel insights into the pathogenesis of AD, but also indicates that the hypolipidemic drug fenofibrate attenuates AD-like pathology in Kallistatin transgenic mice.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The authors did not illustrate whether the protective effect of fenofibrate against AD depends on kallistatin.</p>
<p>The conclusions are supported by the results.</p>

<p>The following is the authorsâ response to the original reviews</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #1:</bold></p>
<p>(1) The mechanism by which fenofibrate rescues memory loss in Kallistatin-transgenic mice is unclear. As a PPARalpha agonist, does fenofibrate target the Kallistatin pathway directly or indirectly? Please provide a discussion based on literature supporting either possibility.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your important suggestion. Fenofibrate is indeed acting as a PPARÎ± agonist. Fenofibrate has been shown to protect memory and cognitive function by downregulating Î±- and Î²-secretases[1]. Activation of PPARÎ± can reduce AÎ² plaques by upregulating ADAM10, thereby protecting memory and cognition[2]. Whereas, Fenofibrate can also act through a PPARÎ±-independent pathway[3]. In our previous study, we proved that Fenofibrate can directly down-regulate the expression of Kallistatin in hepatocytes[4]. Here, our findings showed that Kallistatin induces cognitive memory deterioration by increasing amyloid-Î² plaques accumulation and tau protein hyperphosphorylation (Fig. 1-3), and Fenofibrate can directly down-regulate the serum level of Kallistatin (Fig. 8G). In addition, the expression of PPARÎ± in the hippocampal tissue of Kallistatin (KAL-TG) mice showed no significant difference compared to the WT group (Author response image 1A-B). Therefore, we think Fenofibrate may improve memory and cognitive function at least in part through a PPARÎ±-independent effect, which provides a new mechanism of Fenofibrate in AD with elevated Kallistatin levels.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your suggestion. In addition to hippocampal tissue analysis, we performed immunohistochemical detection of AÎ² and phosphorylated Tau levels in the prefrontal cortex. Our findings revealed that KAL-TG mice exhibited significantly elevated AÎ² and phosphorylated Tau levels in the prefrontal cortex compared to WT mice. These observations align with the pathological patterns observed in hippocampal tissues, demonstrating consistent neurodegenerative pathology across both the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. The data for this part are seen as follows.</p>

<p>(3) Fenofibrate rescued phenotypes in Kallistatin-transgenic mice while rosiglitazone, a PPARgamma agonist, did not. This result contradicts the manuscript's emphasis on a PPARgamma-associated mechanism. Please address this inconsistency.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for the reminder. In fact, our results showed a trend towards improved memory and cognitive function in KAL-TG mice treated with Rosiglitazone, although its effect is not as significant as that of Fenofibrate. Several studies have reported that Rosiglitazone has a beneficial effect on memory and cognitive function in mouse models of dementia, while these studies involve treatment periods of 3 to 4 months[5, 6], whereas our treatment period was only one month. Extending the treatment period with Rosiglitazone may result in a more pronounced improvement. In addition, Fenofibrate may have a PPAR-independent pathway by downregulating Kallistatin directly as discussed above and then show stronger effects.</p>

<p>Thank you for your advice. The trends of changes in different brain regions(including CA1, CA3, or DG) are consistent. Following your suggestion, we have now selected the DG region replaced the different hippocampal subregions with the DG area, and re-conducted the statistical analysis in Fig 5I &amp; 6C, as follows. Due to the significant deposition of AÎ² only in the CA1 region, Fig 2A was not replaced.</p>

<p>(1) It was suggested that Kallistatin is primarily produced by the liver. The study demonstrates increased Kallistatin levels in the hippocampus tissue of AD mice.

<p>(2) Does Kallistatin interact directly with Notch1 ligands? Clarifying this interaction mechanism would enhance understanding of how Kallistatin influences Notch1 signaling in AD pathology.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your suggestion. This study reveals that Kallistatin directly binds to Notch1 and contributes to the activation of the Noch1-HES1 signaling pathway. As for whether Kallistatin can bind to the ligands of Notch1, it needs to conduct further investigations in future studies. Our preliminary data showed that Jagged1 was upregulated in the hippocampal tissues of KAL-TG mice by qPCR and Western blot analyses.</p>

<p>Thank you for your suggestion.

Here, our findings showed that Kallistatin induces cognitive memory deterioration by increasing amyloid-Î² plaques accumulation and tau protein hyperphosphorylation (Fig. 1-3), and Fenofibrate can directly down-regulate the serum level of Kallistatin (Fig. 8G). In addition, the expression of PPARÎ± in the hippocampal tissue of Kallistatin (KAL-TG) mice showed no significant difference compared to the WT group (Author response image 1-B). Therefore, we think Fenofibrate may improve memory and cognitive function at least in part through downregulatin Kallistatin. To conclusively determine whether fenofibrateâs therapeutic effects depend on Kallistatin, future studies should employ Kallistatin-knockout AD animal models to evaluate fenofibrateâs impact on cognitive and memory functions. These investigations will further clarify the mechanistic underpinnings of fenofibrate in AD therapy.</p>

<p>Thank you for your kind suggestion. We have updated the magnified images in the immunohistochemistry section of the article, ensuring that the fields of view for the immunohistochemistry are within the same brain region, and have shown the molecular weights in each bolt. Additionally, we have conducted a quantitative analysis of the protein levels in the Western blot results presented in Fig6&amp;8.</p>

<p>(3) Figures 2c, 3c, and 4a present the Western blot results of p-tau from mice of different ages on one membrane, showing age-dependent expression. The authors analyzed the results of mice of different ages in one statistical chart, which will create ambiguity with the results of the representative images. For example, the expression of p-tau 396 in the blot was lower in the WT-12 M group than in the WT-9 M group (Figure 3c), which is contradictory to the statistical analysis.</p>

<p>Thank you for your reminder. The statistical presentation here does not match the figure. At that time, the WB experiments for the hippocampal tissue at each age group were conducted separately, and it was not appropriate to compare different age groups together. This graph cannot illustrate age dependency. We have replaced the statistical graph in Figure 3B&amp;D, as follows:</p>

<p>(4) Figure 4b shows that KAL-TG-9 M had greater BACE1 expression than KAL-TG-12 M. Furthermore, the nuclei are not uniformly colored. Please provide more representative figures.</p>

<p>Thank you for your reminder. Due to the fact that these sets of data were not processed in a single batch, the ages in the graph are not comparable. Regarding the issue of inconsistent nuclear staining, we have provided another representative image from this group, as follows:</p>

<p>(5) Unclear why the BACE1 and AÎ² levels seems less with KAL+shHES1 treatment than GFP+shNC treatment (Fig 6H)? This finding contradicts the conclusion.</p>

<p>Thank you for your reminder. This experiment was repeated three times, and here, we have represented the representative results along with the corresponding statistical data. There are no difference between KAL+shHES1 treatment and GFP+shNC treatment. We have updated the Fig. 6H.</p>

<p>(7) The authors did not provide the detection range of the AÎ²42 ELISA kit.</p>

<p>Thank you for your suggestion. The AÎ²42 ELISA kit is from the IBL, with the product number 27721. Its standard range is 1.56 - 100 pg/mL, and the sensitivity is 0.05 pg/mL.</p>

<p>(8)The authors did not specify the sex of the mice. This is important since sex could have had a dramatic impact on the results.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your suggestion. The results we present in the text are all statistically obtained from male mice. Actually, we have previously used female mice for Morris Water Maze experiments, and the results showed that both male and female KAL-TG mice exhibited a phenotype of decreased memory and cognitive function compared to the gender-matched WT group, while there was no significant difference between male and female KAL-TG mice (Author response image 5).</p>
