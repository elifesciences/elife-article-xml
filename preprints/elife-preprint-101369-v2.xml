<title>Abstract</title>
<sec>
<title>Background</title>
<p>Bulk transcriptomic analyses of high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) so far have not uncovered potential drug targets, possibly because subtle, disease-relevant transcriptional patterns are overshadowed by dominant, non-relevant ones. Our aim was to uncover disease-outcome-related patterns in HGSOC transcriptomes that may reveal novel drug targets.</p></sec>
<sec>
<title>Method</title>
<p>Using consensus-independent component analysis, we dissected 678 HGSOC transcriptomes of systemic therapy naïve patients—sourced from public repositories—into statistically independent transcriptional components (TCs). To enhance c-ICA’s robustness, we added 447 transcriptomes from non-serous histotypes, low-grade serous, and non- cancerous ovarian tissues. Cox regression and survival tree analysis were performed to determine the association between TC activity and overall survival (OS). Finally, we determined the activity of the OS-associated TCs in 11 publicly available spatially resolved ovarian cancer transcriptomes.</p></sec>
<sec>
<title>Results</title>
<p>We identified 374 TCs, capturing prominent and subtle transcriptional patterns linked to specific biological processes. Six TCs, age, and tumor stage stratified patients with HGSOC receiving platinum-based chemotherapy into ten distinct OS groups. Three TCs were linked to copy-number alterations affecting expression levels of genes involved in replication, apoptosis, proliferation, immune activity, and replication stress. Notably, the TC identifying patients with the shortest OS captured a novel transcriptional pattern linked to synaptic signaling, which was active in tumor regions within all spatially resolved transcriptomes.</p></sec>
<sec>
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The association between a synaptic signaling-related TC and OS supports the emerging role of neurons and their axons as cancer hallmark-inducing constituents of the tumor microenvironment. These constituents might offer a novel drug target for patients with HGSOC.</p></sec>

<title>Summary of Updates:</title>
<fn fn-type="update"><p>To enhance the clinical relevance of our findings, we have included additional details on targeted therapies. Specifically, we expanded the discussion on TRK inhibitors such as entrectinib and larotrectinib, along with the TRKB-specific inhibitor ANA 12. Additionally, we detailed strategies targeting neuronal signaling, including the effects of drugs like ifenprodil and reserpine on tumor proliferation and apoptosis.
We introduced Supplementary Table S8 and new text discussing the association of transcriptional components (TCs) with overall survival (OS) in ovarian clear cell carcinoma, including univariate survival analysis results.
Clarifications were made in the methods section, particularly in the preprocessing of bulk transcriptome data, where we described the whitening transformation and consensus ICA process more explicitly.
Modifications were made to figure legends for Figures 2, 3, and 4 to improve clarity. These changes include explanations of gene set enrichment analysis (Figure 2), survival tree analysis (Figure 3), and co-functionality networks of key genes (Figure 4).
Additional changes in the results section include improved descriptions of transcriptional component activity in ovarian cancer subtypes and their alignment with TCGA clusters. We added Supplementary Figure S9 to illustrate the association between TCGA clusters and TCs.
To enhance reproducibility, we added a code availability statement directing readers to our GitHub repository and included a data availability statement referencing the study accession numbers in Supplementary Table S2.
A heatmap was added as Supplementary Figure S11, along with expanded text explaining the projection of TCs onto single-cell transcriptomes, highlighting distinct transcriptional profiles of unannotated cells in high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC).
Finally, we corrected minor terminology inconsistencies (e.g., specifying &quot;tumor microenvironment&quot; and &quot;neurotrophic receptor tyrosine kinase B receptors&quot;) and streamlined the results section by removing redundant sentences.</p></fn>

<sec id="s1">
<title>Background</title>
<p>Epithelial ovarian cancer encompasses five primary histological subtypes, with high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSOC) constituting about 75% of all cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>). The standard treatment for HGSOC diagnosed at stage IIB and beyond involves a combination of surgery and chemotherapy, primarily using platinum-based compounds and taxanes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>). While initial chemotherapy results in tumor response in most patients with HGSOC, there is a very high recurrence rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>). The addition of poly-ADP ribose polymerase and vascular endothelial growth factor A inhibitors to chemotherapy for subsets of patients currently results in a 5-year disease-specific overall survival (OS) rate of approximately 45% for patients with HGSOC. This rate has hardly improved in the last three decades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>). Therefore, new insights into the complex biology underlying HGSOC are urgently needed to develop more effective treatment strategies.</p>
<p>Previous studies using bulk transcriptomes of patients with HGSOC have identified expression-based molecular subtypes. However, these subtypes did not provide insights that have translated into novel drug targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>). A common limitation of such studies is their reliance on bulk transcriptomes, containing both tumor cells and tumor microenvironment (TME) components, thus reflecting the average transcriptional patterns of the combination of all biological processes present in the tumors. This averaging often masks subtle transcriptional patterns pivotal to understanding HGSOC biology, especially when these are overshadowed by dominant patterns from other less relevant (non-)biological processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>). Consensus-independent component analysis (c-ICA) offers an alternative by decomposing such bulk transcriptomes into statistically independent transcriptional patterns (i.e., transcriptional components; TCs)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>). This approach reveals both dominant and subtle patterns and provides a measure of TC activity for each sample (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>).</p>
<p>In the present study, our aim was to utilize c-ICA to dissect HGSOC transcriptomes to identify as many TCs associated with patient OS as possible, which could reveal potential novel drug targets.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<p>See Supplementary methods for the extended methods.</p>
<sec id="s2a">
<title>Data acquisition</title>
<p>Raw microarray bulk transcriptomes and clinicopathological details for patients with HGSOC, low-grade serous ovarian cancer (LGSOC), non-serous ovarian cancer, and benign ovarian tissues were sourced from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>). We exclusively utilized transcriptomes generated from primary tumor samples. Our analysis was confined to samples on the Affymetrix HG-U133 Plus 2.0 platform (GEO accession identifier: GPL570) and excluded cell line samples. The datasets were pre-processed, and quality controlled as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>). Furthermore, for comprehensive analyses, we incorporated transcriptomes from five distinct resources: the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE, n = 969), Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer (GDSC, n = 959), Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO, n = 13,810), and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA, n = 8,150), and spatially resolved transcriptomes from 10xGenomics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2b">
<title>Consensus-independent component analysis (c-ICA)</title>
<p>To preprocess the bulk transcriptome data, we applied a whitening transformation to prepare it for subsequent analysis. Consensus-ICA was conducted as described previously (Knapen et al., 2024). The output of an c-ICA includes two matrices: (i) transcriptional components (TCs) with gene weights, where each weight within the TC represents both the direction and magnitude of its effect on the expression levels of each gene, and (ii) a consensus mixing matrix (MM) with its coefficients representing the activity scores of TCs across samples.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2c">
<title>Survival analysis</title>
<p>To discern the relationship between TC activity and patient OS, a univariate Cox proportional hazards analysis was conducted on a select group of patients with available follow-up data (<italic>n</italic> = 541, Supplementary Table S1). In addition, a multivariate Cox proportional hazards analysis was carried out, including covariates such as age, stage, debulking status, and tumor grade. This latter analysis was based on a subset of patients with comprehensive clinicopathological data available (<italic>n</italic> = 373, Supplementary Table S1). We implemented a multivariate permutation framework encompassing 10,000 permutations to mitigate the risk of false discoveries. We established the acceptable false discovery rate (FDR) at 1%, maintaining an 80% confidence level, applicable for both the univariate and multivariate analyses.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2d">
<title>Survival tree analysis</title>
<p>We performed a survival tree analysis to delineate groups of patients with HGSOC treated with platinum-based chemotherapy based on distinct transcriptional and clinicopathological attributes. The analysis utilized activities of TCs associated with OS (either from univariate or multivariate survival analysis as mentioned in supplementary methods) in conjunction with relevant clinicopathological factors, such as age, tumor stage, debulking status, and grade, as potential classifiers. We divided patients into two subsets using every plausible cut-off point for each classifier and compared the resulting survival curves employing the log-rank statistic. Consequently, the division was based on the most significant classifier at its optimal cut-off based on the smallest p-value of the log-rank test mentioned above. This divisional process was successfully reiterated on the derived subsets until any of the following stipulated conditions was satisfied: <italic>i</italic>) the total patient count across both subsets fell below 50, <italic>ii</italic>) the collective number of uncensored events in both subsets was &lt; 25, or <italic>iii</italic>) one of the subsets contained &lt; 17 patients. To gauge the stability of our classifiers, we performed 20,000 iterations, randomly selecting 80% of the patient group in each iteration. The significance-based ranks of classifiers in these iterations were correlated with those from the primary survival tree.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2e">
<title>Associating the identified transcriptional components with biological processes</title>
<p>To discern the biological processes associated with the TCs, we adopted a multifaceted approach encompassing <italic>i</italic>) Transcriptional Adaptation to Copy Number Alterations (TACNA) profiling, targeting the identification of TCs that reflect the downstream implications of copy number alterations (CNAs) on gene expression levels(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>); <italic>ii</italic>) Execution of gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) for each TC, utilizing gene set collections (<italic>n</italic> = 16) from The Human Phenotype Ontology (The Monarch Initiative), the Mammalian Phenotypes (Mouse Genome Database), and the Molecular Signatures Database (MsigDB)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>); <italic>iii</italic>) The formation of co-functionality networks on the top and bottom genes of each TC, achieved using the GenetICA methodology, accessible via <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.genetica-network.com">https://www.genetica-network.com</ext-link>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>). For clusters comprising ≥ 5 genes, the enrichment of the predicted functionality was quantified. This served as the foundation for determining the biological process associated with the TC being examined.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2f">
<title>Cross-study transcriptional component projection</title>
<p>To determine whether a biological process captured by an identified TC is also active in other cancer types and to investigate if it is more active in tumor cells or in the tumour microenvironment (TME), we collected raw expression profiles from multiple sources: the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE, <italic>n</italic> = 969), Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer (GDSC, <italic>n</italic> = 959), Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO, <italic>n</italic> = 13,810), and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA, <italic>n</italic> = 8,150)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>). While the CCLE and GDSC datasets comprise cell line profiles across many solid and hematologic malignancies, the GEO and TCGA datasets offer an extensive set of bulk transcriptomes derived from patient samples spanning 27 tumor types. We pre- processed the raw data as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>). Next, we projected the TCs identified via c-ICA onto the cell line expression profiles from CCLE and GDSC and the patient-derived expression profiles from GEO and TCGA. This projection methodology has been described in more detail previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>). To identify potential variations in the activity scores of the TCs, we compared the activity scores among cell lines and samples derived from patients within all four repositories. We used an absolute activity score threshold of 0.05 for each TC to pinpoint outlier cell lines and patient tumors with heightened activity.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2g">
<title>Determination of spatial transcriptomic profiles’ significant activity locations for individual transcriptional components</title>
<p>To further assess whether a biological process captured by an identified TC is more active in tumor cells or in the TME, we collected publicly available spatial resolved transcriptomic profiles of ovarian cancer samples. Eight were sourced from GEO (study ID GSE211956), and three were sourced from the public dataset repository of 10xGenomics (see supplementary methods for details) generated using the 10xGenomics Visium platform. The samples were from patients with HGSOC, serous papillary, and endometrioid ovarian cancer. Activity for each TC across every location within the spatial samples was ascertained through the cross- study projection methodology referred to in the previous method section (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>). We incorporated a permutation-driven approach to discern the markedly active areas within the spatial samples for each TC. We derived a null distribution of activities for each TC-location pairing by performing 3,000 permutations and subsequent projections. The p-value of each observed TC activity quantifies the significance of the deviation of the TC activity at a given location from its baseline null distribution. After this, we visualized the z-transformed p- values using a heatmap, followed by obtaining colocalization scores for each combination of TCs in the spatial transcriptomic profiles for each ovarian cancer sample (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>). This visualization aided in highlighting the areas with notable activity aligned against the stained representation of the tissue sample.</p>

<sec id="s3a">
<title>An integrated data set containing 1,125 bulk transcriptomes from ovarian tissues</title>
<p>We curated 1,193 bulk transcriptomes from the GEO, including patients with HGSOC, low- grade serous ovarian cancer (LGSOC), non-serous ovarian cancer, and benign ovarian tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>). These were extracted from 32 distinct studies and represented the entire spectrum of ovarian cancer types, stages, and grades, and included 43 samples from non-malignant ovarian tissue. Pre-processing, which included removing duplicates and quality checks, culminated in a refined dataset of 1,125 samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>). Supplementary Tables S1 and S2 provide detailed breakdowns of these samples, showcasing the comprehensive coverage of ovarian cancer types, stages, and grades within this dataset. The ovarian cancer dataset comprised bulk transcriptomes of patients with HGSOC (<italic>n</italic> = 678), other serous (<italic>n</italic> = 110), endometrioid (<italic>n</italic> = 110), and clear-cell ovarian cancer samples (<italic>n</italic> = 96). Additionally, for 541 patients, comprehensive survival data was available, as well as additional clinicopathologic information, including age, grade, stage, subtype, treatment schedule, and debulking status for 373 patients (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>).</p>

<title>Consensus-independent component analysis identifies 374 transcriptional components (TCs)</title>
<p>c-ICA on the 1,125 bulk transcriptomes revealed 374 independent TCs. Notably, 135 TCs captured the impact of copy number alterations on gene expression levels. Each TC displayed enrichment for at least one gene set from the 16 gene set collections, with an absolute Z-score of more than two. For example, the number of enriched gene sets from the Hallmark gene set collection in an individual TC ranged from zero to 28 enriched gene sets (interquartile range 3 – 7). The median top Z score for Hallmark gene sets was 3.21 (range 1.55 – 37.54, interquartile range 2.6 – 4.25).

<p>The activities of 13 TCs were associated with patient overall survival (OS) in a univariate analysis, with an additional TC (TC166) identified in a multivariate analysis accounting for age, stage, debulking, and tumor grade. Combined, these 14 OS-associated TCs were enriched for gene sets associated with diverse biological processes and clinicopathological characteristics, with four TCs capturing the effects of copy number alterations on gene expression levels.</p>

<title>The activities of six transcriptional components are associated with patient overall survival</title>
<p>For a selected subset of 541 patients—including HGSOC, LGSOC, and non-serous ovarian cancer—with available OS information (Supplementary Table S1), 13 TC activities displayed an association with OS univariately (false discovery rate 5%, confidence level 80% in permutation-based multiple testing framework Supplementary Table S3; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). For patients with serous ovarian cancer, treated with platinum-based therapy (<italic>n</italic> = 301, Supplementary Table S1), lower activity of one additional TC (TC166) was associated with worse OS independent of age, stage, debulking, and tumor grade (Supplementary Table S4). Combined, these 14 OS-associated TCs were enriched for gene sets associated with diverse biological processes and clinicopathological characteristics. Four of these TCs captured the downstream effects of CNAs on gene expression levels (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>, Supplementary Fig. S1-S3). Survival tree analysis identified ten groups of patients with platinum-treated HGSOC based on the activity of six OS-associated TCs and the presence of two clinicopathological characteristics, namely age and stage (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>, Supplementary Table S5, median robustness statistic of survival tree = 0.52, interquartile range = 0.36 - 0.69). The survival tree demonstrated good classification power (concordance statistic = 0.72, standard error = 0.021). As expected, patients were divided into separate survival groups based on stage (1/2 vs. 3/4) and age (&lt;53.7 vs. ≥53.7 years). The most significant difference in OS was observed between the cohorts with low and high TC121 activity (Supplementary Table S5). Patients with high TC121 tumor activity exhibited the shortest OS, also observed for the subset of patients with advanced-stage HGSOC (Supplementary Fig. S4, Supplementary Table S6). Supplementary Fig. S5 indicates that TC121 activity is highest in patients with HGSOC compared to other ovarian cancer subtypes. Notably, all subtypes contain subsets of samples with elevated TC121 activity. These robust associations with OS for TC121 in these two subsets of patients indicate the relevance of TC121, irrespective of stage.</p>

<p>The results of survival tree analysis of 294 patients with high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) treated with platinum-based chemotherapy are presented. The analysis utilized 14 transcriptional components (TCs) associated with overall survival (OS), along with other clinicopathologic factors, including age, tumor stage, grade, and debulking status. The resulting tree identified nine distinct survival cohorts, each represented as a bar in the Sankey diagram, where the bar height corresponds to the number of patients in each cohort. Kaplan-Meier survival curves with accompanying number-at-risk tables are shown for each cohort, with survival data censored at 10 years. The names of the survival cohorts were based on enriched biological processes in the TCs, as determined by the chromosomal location of genes captured by a TC, GSEA, and co-functionality analysis of the top genes. The p-values in the Kaplan-Meier plots were derived from log-rank tests comparing survival distributions between groups.

<title>Distinct biological processes show enrichment in the transcriptional components associated with overall survival</title>
<p>Three of the six TCs associated with OS—TC166, TC247, and TC76—captured the effects of CNAs on the expression levels of genes mapping to chromosome regions 13q12-q14, 11q13-q14, and 9p13-p21, respectively (Supplementary Fig. S6, Supplementary Table S7) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>). The higher activity of TC166 was associated with better OS, whereas the higher activities of TC121, TC247, TC250, TC76, and TC146, were associated with worse OS. Among the 14 OS- associated TCs, only TC166 showed a significant association with OS in an independent cohort of patients with ovarian clear cell carcinoma (Bonferroni corrected p-value &lt; 0.05; see supplementary methods and Supplementary Table S8) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>). The top genes from TC166 were enriched for genes involved in replication and apoptosis. The chromosomal region 13q12- q14 linked to the TC166, contains the tumor suppressor genes retinoblastoma 1 (<italic>RB1</italic>) and Breast Cancer Type 2 Susceptibility Protein (<italic>BRCA2</italic>). Loss of heterozygosity of this chromosomal region is frequently observed in both sporadic and hereditary serous ovarian cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>). The top genes from TC247 were enriched for genes involved in proliferation and immune cell activation, TC76 in replication stress, TC250 in extracellular matrix (ECM) interactions, and TC146 in neurotransmitter signaling.</p>
<p>Intriguingly, the top 100 genes in TC121 revealed a co-functional cluster enriched for genes involved in synaptic signaling, with the corresponding proteins reported to localize to the synaptic membrane of neurons (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). Among these were pre-synaptic protein neurexin-1 (<italic>NRXN1</italic>) and its post-synaptic ligand leucine-rich repeat transmembrane protein 2 (<italic>LRRTM2</italic>), which regulates excitatory synapse formation (top 20 genes are described in Supplementary Table S9, for more details: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://transcriptional-landscape-ovarian.opendatainscience.net">http://transcriptional-landscape-ovarian.opendatainscience.net</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>). Furthermore, this co-functional cluster included neuron-specific synaptic structure proteins, neurofilament light, and medium chain. Moreover, genes encoding for potassium ion channel proteins integral to membrane repolarization during synapse signal transduction carried high weights in TC121. These genes included <italic>KCNC1, KCNN2</italic>, and <italic>KCNIP1</italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>).

In line with this proposed function, high activity of TC121 was observed in neuroblastoma cell lines but not in ovarian or central nervous system cancer cell lines in the GDSC and CCLE datasets (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>, Supplementary Fig. S7, S8). In the GEO and TCGA datasets, high activity of TC121 was observed in glioblastoma multiforme and lower-grade glioma but not in ovarian cancer patient samples (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>).</p>

<title>Distinct cluster of patients from TCGA overlap with elevated activity of TC121</title>
<p>To explore if pre-existing classifications of patients with ovarian cancer correspond to the contrasting activities of the TCs, we investigated the classification provided by TCGA. TCGA identified four optimal clusters describing the patients with ovarian cancer using transcriptional profiles.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>) To explore associations between these clusters and TC activity, we performed a Kruskal-Wallis test using TCGA sample data. Supplementary Fig. S9 highlights the associations between each cluster set and the TCs, represented by log-transformed p-values. A significant association between a TC and a cluster set indicates that at least one cluster within the cluster set exhibited significantly different activity scores for the corresponding TC compared to the other clusters. Notably, samples with high TC121 activity were not captured by any of the clusters of the four-cluster set. Interestingly, the eight-cluster set predefined by TCGA was able to identify a cluster that corresponded to samples with elevated TC121 and TC146 activity. This finding suggests that while TCGA’s analysis identified this patient group based on transcriptional profiles, it didn’t characterize them further.</p>

<title>Distinct spatial and single cell transcriptional profiles with high activity of OS-associated TCs</title>
<p>Cross-study TC projection onto spatial transcriptomic profiles from 11 ovarian cancer samples revealed that TC121 was highly active in profiles from the tumor region of the 11 ovarian cancer samples (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>; Supplementary Fig. S10). Additionally, TC121 showed markedly higher activity in the transcriptional profiles of a subset of the unannotated single cells from HGSOC patients (study ID GSE158722; see supplementary methods and Supplementary Fig. S11).(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>) This finding suggests that some of these unannotated cells could be neurons. Furthermore, the unannotated single cell transcriptional profiles showed contrasting activity scores of different OS-associated TCs (supplementary Fig. S11). These contrasting activities indicate that these TCs could provide insights into the biology of previously uncharacterized cell types. Distinct regions with high activity of the copy number TCs (TC166, TC247, and TC76) in the HGSOC sample overlapped with the region containing cancer cells, as expected. TC250, enriched for extracellular matrix interactions, was also active in the stromal region. The strongest inverse colocalization (colocalization score -2.43) was observed between the activity scores of TC146, enriched for neurotransmitter signaling, and TC76, captured the effect of copy number alterations at chromosome 9p13-p21, at the serous ovarian cancer sample (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref>, Supplementary Table S10).</p>

We ran 5,000 permutations for each TC-profile combination, yielding a p-value that indicates the extent to which the TC activity in the corresponding profile differs from what would be expected by chance (the null distribution). We then transformed these p-values into logarithmic values and represented them using a heatmap. Heatmaps of activity scores of the TCs are presented in individual rows for the HGSOC, serous papillary, and endometrioid adenocarcinoma of ovary samples. The first column represents the stained images of the samples. The second to seventh columns show heatmaps corresponding to the mentioned TCs. <bold>B</bold>. The heatmap illustrates the colocalization between two TC activities on spatial transcriptomic profiles from ovarian cancer samples. For each cell, the colocalization scores of the TCs at each of the three spatial transcriptomics samples OC 1, OC 2, and OC 3 are arranged in columns. A colocalization score of 4 between two TCs (red) indicates that the positively (+) and negatively (−) active regions of both TCs are perfectly colocalized. Conversely, a colocalization score of -4 between two TCs (blue) also indicates colocalization. Still, with inverse activity, i.e., the positively active regions of one TC are colocalized with the negatively active regions of the other TC or vice versa. A colocalization score close to 0 between two TCs (white) indicates that the activities of two TCs are spatially separated.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we identified 374 TCs, each enriched for gene sets representing various biological processes in HGSOC samples. Six could stratify patients with HGSOC who had received platinum-based treatment into ten distinct OS groups.</p>
<p>The most significant TC in the survival tree analysis, TC121, captured a clinically relevant subtle transcriptional pattern linked to synaptic signaling not previously recognized in HGSOC. In the survival tree, TC121 identified 12% of the HGSOC patients with the shortest OS and, based on spatially resolved transcriptomic analyzed samples, is active in tumor regions. This observation supports the emerging role of neurons and neuronal projections as cancer hallmark-inducing constituents of the TME (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>).</p>
<p>Further investigation on whether the activity of TC121 originated from tumor cells or in the TME revealed that the TC121 signal is coming from cells within the TME. The high activity of TC121 in low-grade glioma and glioblastoma multiforme patient samples (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>) is in agreement with the presence of neurons in large numbers within the TME of gliomas, where they form functional synapses with tumor cells(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>). Moreover, TC121 activity was lower in non-brain cancers, such as ovarian cancers, which contain fewer neurons and synapses in the TME compared to brain cancers. We expected TC121 activity to be low in the bulk transcriptomes of all cell lines, since they lack TME. TC121 activity in most cell lines, which includes glioblastoma and ovarian cancer cell lines, was indeed low. Neuroblastoma cell lines, however, exhibited high TC121 activity, which is likely due to retained synaptic formation capacity originating from neuroblast cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>). Lastly, TC121’s high activity observed in small, scattered regions within the tumor of spatially resolved transcriptomic ovarian cancer samples also supports TC121’s role in the TME.</p>
<p>TC121’s significant association with OS underscores the potential significance of synaptic signaling in HGSOC biology. Yet, the neuronal subtype and the molecular mechanisms associated with TC121 remain to be elucidated. A study in human ovarian cancer-bearing mice demonstrated that sympathetic innervation in HGSOC involves adrenergic signaling: norepinephrine released by sympathetic neurons binds to beta- adrenergic receptors on the cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>). This binding triggers the tumor cells to release brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), which enhances cancer innervation via activation of host neurotrophic receptor tyrosine kinase B receptors (NTRK2), thereby establishing a feed-forward loop of sustained signaling. BDNF and the nerve marker neurofilament protein expression were examined in 108 human ovarian tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>). This study revealed that increased intratumoral nerve presence strongly correlates with elevated BDNF and norepinephrine levels, advanced tumor stage, and shorter OS in patients with ovarian cancer. This interaction can be targeted with pan-TRK inhibitors such as entrectinib and larotrectinib. Both drugs are showing promising results in multiple phase II trials, including ovarian cancer and breast cancer patients. Furthermore, a TRKB-specific inhibitor was developed (ANA-12), but has not been subjected to any clinical trials in cancer so far (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>). Our analysis indicated that <italic>BDNF</italic> is a prominent gene (with an absolute weight &gt; 3) in 10 TCs but not in TC121, suggesting that TC121 may indicate a distinct process unrelated to BDNF.</p>
<p>The significance of sensory innervation in HGSOC was evidenced by the co- localization of TRPV1, a marker for sensory neurons, and β-III tubulin, a general neuronal marker, in immunofluorescent staining of histological sections from 75 patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>). Additionally, a murine model study employing neural tracing identified sensory neurons originating from local dorsal root ganglia and jugular–nodose ganglia, with axons extending into the TME (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>). A transgenic murine model lacking nociceptors demonstrated that this specific subtype of sensory neurons was involved in tumor progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>). Another study showed that reducing the release of Calcitonin gene-related peptide from tumor-innervating nociceptors could be a strategy to alleviate this effect of nociceptors by improving anti- tumour immunity of cytotoxic CD8+ T cells in a melanoma model bearing mice(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>). This indicates that the signal from TC121 may represent an indirect influence on tumor cells via interactions with immune cells and the promotion of an immune suppressive TME. Furthermore, in cell lines derived from Trp53<sup>−/−</sup> Pten<sup>−/−</sup> murine HGSOC, the influence of nociceptors was characterized by the release of substance P (SP), their primary neuropeptide. SP is an alternative splicing product of the preprotachykinin A gene (<italic>TAC1</italic>) and binds to the receptor neurokinin 1 (NK1R), encoded by the <italic>TACR1</italic> gene. NK1R expression was confirmed in murine HGSOC cell line, and SP enhanced cellular proliferation in NK1R-positive murine HGSOC cancer cells <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>). Our analysis identified <italic>TAC1</italic> and <italic>TACR1</italic> as prominent genes in 15 and 2 TCs, respectively, yet not in TC121, and none of these TCs were associated with patient survival. Currently, there are no drugs specifically targeting tumor innervation in (ovarian) cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>). Interestingly, the NK1R antagonist aprepitant effectively inhibited the metastasis-promoting effects of neural substance P in human breast and mammary cancer bearing mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>), demonstrating the feasibility of such an approach.</p>
<p>Strategies to disrupt neuronal signaling and neurotransmitter release in neurons target key elements of excitatory neurotransmission, such as calcium flux and vesicle formation. Drugs like ifenprodil and lamotrigine, commonly used to treat neuronal disorders, block glutamate release and subsequent neuronal signaling. Additionally, the vesicular monoamine transporter (VMAT) inhibitor reserpine prevents synaptic vesicle formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>). In vitro studies with HGSOC cell lines have demonstrated that ifenprodil significantly inhibits tumour proliferation, while reserpine induces apoptosis in cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>). These approaches hold promise for inhibiting neuronal signaling and interactions in the TME. Therefore, it is essential that the mechanisms driving this nerve growth, the specifics of how nerves within the TME interact with ovarian cancer cells, and how they impact the survival of patients with HGSOC are further elucidated.</p>
<p>Altogether, the present study uncovered a clinically relevant TC linked to synaptic signaling not previously identified in HGSOC. This TC may represent a novel cancer cell- extrinsic mechanism within the TME, illustrating how cancer cells and nerve cells interact to promote enhanced proliferation. A deeper understanding of the molecular aspects of tumor innervation could pave the way for novel drug targets for patients with HGSOC.</p>

<p>This <bold>valuable</bold> study uses consensus-independent component analysis to highlight transcriptional components (TC) in high-grade serous ovarian cancers (HGSOC). The study presents a <bold>convincing</bold> preliminary finding by identifying a TC linked to synaptic signaling that is associated with shorter overall survival in HGSOC patients, highlighting the potential role of neuronal interactions in the tumour microenvironment. This finding is corroborated by comparing spatially resolved transcriptomics in a small-scale study; a weakness is it being descriptive, non-mechanistic, and requires experimental validation.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This manuscript explores the transcriptional landscape of high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) using consensus-independent component analysis (c-ICA) to identify transcriptional components (TCs) associated with patient outcomes. The study analyzes 678 HGSOC transcriptomes, supplemented with 447 transcriptomes from other ovarian cancer types and noncancerous tissues. By identifying 374 TCs, the authors aim to uncover subtle transcriptional patterns that could serve as novel drug targets. Notably, a transcriptional component linked to synaptic signaling was associated with shorter overall survival (OS) in patients, suggesting a potential role for neuronal interactions in the tumor microenvironment. Given notable weaknesses like lack of validation cohort or validation using other platforms (other than the 11 samples with ST), the data is considered highly descriptive and preliminary.</p>
<p>The study reveals significant findings by identifying a transcriptional component (TC121) associated with synaptic signaling, which is linked to shorter survival in patients with high-grade serous ovarian cancer, highlighting the potential role of neurons in the tumor microenvironment. However, the evidence could be strengthened by experimental validation to confirm the functional roles of key genes within TC121 and further exploration of its spatial aspects, including deeper analysis of neuronal and synaptic and other neuronal gene expression.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Innovative Methodology:</p>
<p>
The use of c-ICA to dissect bulk transcriptomes into independent components is a novel approach that allows for the identification of subtle transcriptional patterns that may be overshadowed in traditional analyses.</p>
<p>Comprehensive Data Integration:</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Consensus-independent component analysis and closely related methods have previously been used to reveal components of transcriptomic data which are not captured by principal component or gene-gene coexpression analyses.</p>
<p>Here, the authors asked whether applying consensus-independent component analysis (c-ICA) to published high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) microarray-based transcriptomes would reveal subtle transcriptional patterns which are not captured by existing molecular omics classifications of HGSOC.</p>
<p>Statistical associations of these (hitherto masked) transcriptional components with prognostic outcomes in HGSOC would lead to additional insights into underlying mechanisms and, coupled with corroborating evidence from spatial transcriptomics, are proposed for further investigation.</p>
<p>This approach is complementary to existing transcriptomics classifications of HGSOC.</p>
<p>The authors have previously applied the same approach in colorectal carcinoma (for example, Knapen et al. (2024) Commun. Med).</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Overall, this study describes a solid data-driven description of c-ICA-derived transcriptional components that the authors identified in HGSOC microarray transcriptomics data, supported by detailed methods and supplementary documentation.</p>
<p>The biological interpretation of transcriptional components is convincing based on (data-driven) permutation analysis and a suite of analyses of association with copy-number, gene sets, and prognostic outcomes.</p>
<p>
The resulting annotated transcriptional components have been made available in a searchable online format.</p>
<p>For the highlighted transcriptional component which has been annotated as related to synaptic signalling, the detection of the transcriptional component among 11 published spatial transcriptomics samples from ovarian cancers is compelling and supports the need for further mechanistic follow-up.</p>
<p>Further comments:</p>
<p>This revised version includes a suite of comparisons between the c-ICA-derived components and existing published transcriptomic/genomic-based classifications of ovarian cancers. Newly described components will require experimental validation, as acknowledged by the authors.</p>
<p>Here, the authors primarily interpret the c-ICA transcriptional components as a deconvolution of bulk transcriptomics due to the presence of cells from tumour cells and the tumour microenvironment.</p>
<p>
In this revised version, the authors additionally investigate their TC scores in single cells from a published HGSOC single-cell RNAseq dataset, highlighting examples of TC scores within and between cell types.</p>
<p>c-ICA is not explicitly a deconvolution method with respect to cell types: the transcriptional components do not necessarily correspond to distinct cell types, and may reflect differential dysregulation within a cell type. This application of c-ICA for the purpose of data-driven deconvolution of cell populations is distinct from other deconvolution methods which explicitly use a prior cell signature matrix.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>eLife Assessment</bold></p>
<p>This valuable study uses consensus-independent component analysis to highlight transcriptional components (TC) in high-grade serous ovarian cancers (HGSOC). The study presents a convincing preliminary finding by identifying a TC linked to synaptic signaling that is associated with shorter overall survival in HGSOC patients, highlighting the potential role of neuronal interactions in the tumour microenvironment. This finding is corroborated by comparing spatially resolved transcriptomics in a small-scale study; a weakness is in being descriptive, non-mechanistic, and requiring experimental validation.”</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We sincerely thank the editors for their valuable and constructive feedback. We are grateful for the recognition of our findings and the importance of identifying transcriptional components in high-grade serous ovarian cancers.</p>
<p>We acknowledge the editors’ observation regarding the descriptive nature of our study and its limited mechanistic depth. We agree that additional experimental validation would further strengthen our conclusions. We are planning and executing the experiments for a future study to provide mechanistic insights into the associations found in this study. In addition, recent reviews focused on the emerging field of cancer neuroscience emphasize the early stages the field is in, specifically in terms of a mechanistic understanding of the contributions of tumor-infiltrating nerves in tumor initiation and progression (Amit et al., 2024; Hwang et al., 2024). Nonetheless, we wish to emphasize that emerging mechanistic preclinical studies have demonstrated the influence of tumour-infiltrating nerves on disease progression (Allen et al., 2018; Balood et al., 2022; Darragh et al., 2024; Globig et al., 2023; Jin et al., 2022; Restaino et al., 2023; Zahalka et al., 2017). Several of these studies include contributions from our co-authors and feature <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> research on head and neck squamous cell carcinoma as well as high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma samples. This study further strengthens the preclinical work by showing in patient data, the potential relevance of neuronal signaling on disease outcome.</p>
<p>For instance, Restiano et al. (2023) demonstrated that substance P, released from tumour-infiltrating nociceptors, potentiates MAP kinase signaling in cancer cells, thereby driving disease progression. Crucially, this effect was shown to be reversible <italic>in vivo</italic> by blocking the substance P receptor (Restaino et al., 2023). These findings offer compelling evidence of the role of tumour innervation in cancer biology.</p>
<p>Our current study in tumor samples of patients with high-grade serous ovarian cancer identifies a transcriptional component that is enriched for genes for which the protein is located in the synapse. We believe that the previously published mechanistic insights support our findings and suggest that this transcriptional component could serve as a valuable screening tool to identify innervated tumours based on bulk transcriptomes. Clinically, this information is highly relevant, as patients with innervated tumours may benefit from alternate therapeutic strategies targeting these innervations.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public review)</bold></p>
<p>This manuscript explores the transcriptional landscape of high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) using consensus-independent component analysis (c-ICA) to identify transcriptional components (TCs) associated with patient outcomes. The study analyzes 678 HGSOC transcriptomes, supplemented with 447 transcriptomes from other ovarian cancer types and noncancerous tissues. By identifying 374 TCs, the authors aim to uncover subtle transcriptional patterns that could serve as novel drug targets. Notably, a transcriptional component linked to synaptic signaling was associated with shorter overall survival (OS) in patients, suggesting a potential role for neuronal interactions in the tumour microenvironment. Given notable weaknesses like lack of validation cohort or validation using another platform (other than the 11 samples with ST), the data is considered highly descriptive and preliminary.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) Innovative Methodology:</p>
<p>The use of c-ICA to dissect bulk transcriptomes into independent components is a novel approach that allows for the identification of subtle transcriptional patterns that may be overshadowed in traditional analyses.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for recognizing the strengths and novelty of our study. We appreciate the positive feedback on using consensus-independent component analysis (c-ICA) to decompose bulk transcriptomes, which allowed us to detect subtle transcriptional signals often overlooked in traditional analyses.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) Comprehensive Data Integration:</p>
<p>The study integrates a large dataset from multiple public repositories, enhancing the robustness of the findings. The inclusion of spatially resolved transcriptomes adds a valuable dimension to the analysis.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for recognizing the robustness of our study through comprehensive data integration. We appreciate the acknowledgment of our efforts to leverage a large, multi-source dataset, as well as the additional insights gained from spatially resolved transcriptomes. We consider this integrative approach enhances the depth of our analysis and contributes to a more nuanced understanding of the tumour microenvironment.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) Clinical Relevance:</p>
<p>The identification of a synaptic signaling-related TC associated with poor prognosis highlights a potential new avenue for therapeutic intervention, emphasizing the role of the tumour microenvironment in cancer progression.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the recognition of the clinical implications of our findings. The identification of a synaptic signaling-related transcriptional component associated with poor prognosis underscores the potential for novel therapeutic targets within the tumour microenvironment. We agree that this insight could open new avenues for intervention and further highlights the role of neuronal interactions in cancer progression.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) Mechanistic Insights:</p>
<p>While the study identifies TCs associated with survival, it provides limited mechanistic insights into how these components influence cancer progression. Further experimental validation is necessary to elucidate the underlying biological processes.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We acknowledge the point regarding the limited mechanistic insights provided in our study. We agree that further experimental validation would significantly enhance our understanding of how the biological processes captured by these transcriptional components influence cancer progression. We are planning and executing the experiments for  a future study to provide mechanistic insights into the associations found in this study.</p>
<p>Our analyses were performed on publicly available bulk and spatial resolved expression profiles. To investigate the mechanistic insights in future studies, we plan to integrate spatial transcriptomic data with immunohistochemical analysis of the same tumour samples to validate our findings. Additionally, we have initiated efforts to set up <italic>in vitro</italic> co-cultures of neurons and ovarian cancer cells. These co-cultures will enable us to investigate how synaptic signaling impacts ovarian cancer cell behavior.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) Generalizability:</p>
<p>The findings are primarily based on transcriptomic data from HGSOC. It remains unclear how these results apply to other subtypes of ovarian cancer or different cancer types.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>To respond to this remark, we utilized survival data from Bolton et al. (2022) and TCGA to investigate associations between TC activity scores and overall survival of patients with ovarian clear cell carcinoma, the second most common subtype of epithelial ovarian cancer, and  other cancer types respectively. However, we acknowledge the limitations of TCGA survival data, as highlighted in the referenced article (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8726696/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8726696/</ext-link>). Additionally, as shown in Figure 5, we provided evidence of TC121 activity across various cancer types, suggesting broader relevance. For the results of the analyses mentioned above, please refer to our response to remark 1.3 of the recommendation section (page 4).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) Innovative Methodology:</p>
<p>Requires more validation using different platforms (IHC) to validate the performance of this bulk-derived data. Also, the lack of control over data quality is a concern.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We acknowledge the value of validating our results with alternative platforms such as IHC. We are planning and executing the experiments for a future study to provide mechanistic insights into the associations found in this study.</p>
<p>We implemented regarding data quality control, the following measures to ensure the reliability of our analysis:</p>
<p>Bulk Transcriptional Profiles: To assess data quality, we conducted principal component analysis (PCA) on the sample Pearson product-moment correlation matrix. The first principal component (PCqc), which explains approximately 80-90% of the variance, was used to distinguish technical variability from biological signals (Bhattacharya et al., 2020). Samples with a correlation coefficient below 0.8 relative to PCqc were identified as outliers and excluded. Additionally, MD5 hash values were generated for each CEL file to identify and remove duplicate samples. Expression values were standardized to a mean of zero and a variance of one for each gene to minimize probeset- or gene-specific variability across datasets (GEO, CCLE, GDSC, and TCGA).</p>
<p>Spatial Transcriptional Profiles: PCA was also applied to spatial transcriptomic data for quality control. Only samples with consistent loading factor signs for the first principal component across all individual spot profiles were retained. Samples failing this criterion were excluded from further analyses.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) Clinical Application:</p>
<p>Although the study suggests potential drug targets, the translation of these findings into clinical practice is not addressed. Probably given the lack of some QA/QC procedures it'll be hard to translate these results. Future studies should focus on validating these targets in clinical settings.”</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Regarding clinical applications, we acknowledge the importance of further exploring strategies targeting synaptic signaling and neurotransmitter release in the tumour microenvironment (TME). As partially discussed in the first version of the manuscript, drugs such as ifenprodil and lamotrigine—commonly used to treat neuronal disorders—can block glutamate release, thereby inhibiting subsequent synaptic signaling. Additionally, the vesicular monoamine transporter (VMAT) inhibitor reserpine blocks the formation of synaptic vesicles (Reid et al., 2013; Williams et al., 2001). Previous in vitro studies with HGSOC cell lines demonstrated that ifenprodil significantly reduced cancer cell proliferation, while reserpine triggered apoptosis in cancer cells (North et al., 2015; Ramamoorthy et al., 2019). The findings highlight the potential of such approaches to disrupt synaptic neurotransmission in the TME.</p>
<p>To address potential translation of our findings into clinical practice more comprehensively, we have included additional details in the manuscript:</p>
<p>Section discussion, page 16, lines 338-341:</p>
<p>“This interaction can be targeted with pan-TRK inhibitors such as entrectinib and larotrectinib. Both drugs are showing promising results in multiple phase II trials, including ovarian cancer and breast cancer patients. Furthermore, a TRKB-specific inhibitor was developed (ANA-12), but has not been subjected to any clinical trials in cancer so far (Ardini et al., 2016; Burris et al., 2015; Drilon et al., 2018, 2017).”</p>
<p>On page 17, lines 361-374:</p>
<p>“Strategies to disrupt neuronal signaling and neurotransmitter release in neurons target key elements of excitatory neurotransmission, such as calcium flux and vesicle formation. Drugs like ifenprodil and lamotrigine, commonly used to treat neuronal disorders, block glutamate release and subsequent neuronal signaling. Additionally, the vesicular monoamine transporter (VMAT) inhibitor reserpine prevents synaptic vesicle formation (Reid et al., 2013; Williams, 2001). In vitro studies with HGSOC cell lines have demonstrated that ifenprodil significantly inhibits tumour proliferation, while reserpine induces apoptosis in cancer cells (North et al., 2015; Ramamoorthy et al., 2019). These approaches hold promise for inhibiting neuronal signaling and interactions in the TME.”</p>

<p>We thank the reviewer for acknowledging the strength of our data-driven approach and the use of consensus-independent component analysis (c-ICA) to identify transcriptional components within HGSOC microarray data. We aimed to provide comprehensive methodological detail and supplementary documentation to support the reproducibility and robustness of our findings.

<p>We appreciate the positive feedback on the biological interpretation of our transcriptional components. We are pleased that our approach, which includes data-driven permutation testing and analyses of associations with copy-number alterations, gene sets, and prognostic outcomes, was found to be convincing. These analyses were integral to enhancing our findings’ robustness and biological relevance.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) The resulting annotated transcriptional components have been made available in a searchable online format.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for this important positive remark.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) For the highlighted transcriptional component which has been annotated as related to synaptic signalling, the detection of the transcriptional component among 11 published spatial transcriptomics samples from ovarian cancers appears to support this preliminary finding and requires further mechanistic follow-up.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for acknowledging the accessibility of our annotated transcriptional components. We prioritized making these data available in a searchable online format to facilitate further research and enable the community to explore and validate our findings.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) This study has not explicitly compared the c-ICA transcriptional components to the existing reported transcriptional landscape and classifications for ovarian cancers (e.g. Smith et al Nat Comms 2023; TCGA Nature 2011; Engqvist et al Sci Rep 2020) which would enable a further assessment of the additional contribution of c-ICA - whether the cICA approach captured entirely complementary components, or whether some components are correlated with the existing reported ovarian transcriptomic classifications.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We acknowledge the reviewer’s insightful suggestion to compare our c-ICA-derived transcriptional components with previously reported ovarian cancer classifications, such as those from Smith et al. (2023), TCGA (2011), and Engqvist et al. (2020). To address this, we incorporated analyses comparing the activity scores of our transcriptional components with these published landscapes and classifications, particularly focusing on any associations with overall survival. Additionally, we evaluated correlations between gene signatures from a subset of these studies and our identified TCs, enhancing our understanding of the unique contributions of the c-ICA approach. Please refer to our response to remark 10 for the results of these analyses.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) Here, the authors primarily interpret the c-ICA transcriptional components as a deconvolution of bulk transcriptomics due to the presence of cells from tumour cells and the tumour microenvironment.</p>
<p>However, c-ICA is not explicitly a deconvolution method with respect to cell types: the transcriptional components do not necessarily correspond to distinct cell types, and may reflect differential dysregulation within a cell type. This application of c-ICA for the purpose of data-driven deconvolution of cell populations is distinct from other deconvolution methods that explicitly use a prior cell signature matrix.”</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We acknowledge that c-ICA, unlike traditional deconvolution methods, is not specifically designed for cell-type deconvolution and does not rely on a predefined cell signature matrix. While we explored the transcriptional components in the context of tumour and microenvironmental interactions, we agree that these components may not correspond directly to distinct cell types but rather reflect complex patterns of dysregulation, potentially within individual cell populations.</p>
<p>Our goal with c-ICA was to uncover hidden transcriptional patterns possibly influenced by cellular heterogeneity. However, we recognize these patterns may also arise from regulatory processes within a single cell type. To investigate further, we used single-cell transcriptional data (~60,000 cell-types annotated profiles from GSE158722) and projected our transcriptional components onto these profiles to obtain activity scores, allowing us to assess each TC’s behavior across diverse cellular contexts after removing the first principal component to minimize background effects. Please refer to our response to remark 2.2 in the recommendations to the authors (page 14) for the results of this analysis.</p>
