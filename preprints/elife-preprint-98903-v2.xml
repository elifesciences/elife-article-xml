<title>Abstract</title><p>Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the most common subtype of lung cancer, and the prognosis is poor due to distant metastasis. Thus, there is an urgent need to discover novel therapeutic targets and strategies to overcome metastasis. A series of in vitro and in vivo phenotype experiments were performed to investigate the role of PDE1A in NSCLC. The RIP assay, mRNA stability assay and LC-MS/MS were performed to investigate the molecular mechanisms of PDE1A in NSCLC progression. We demonstrated that phosphodiesterase 1A (PDE1A) promoted metastasis and EMT progression of NSCLC. In addition, NSCLC cells overexpressing PDE1A promoted angiogenesis by regulating exosome release. IL-6/JAK/STAT3 signaling pathway was highly enriched in PDE1A-coexpresssed genes, and PDE1A promoted NSCLC metastasis by activating the STAT3 pathway. GO enrichment analysis of PDE1A-interacting genes showed that PDE1A might interact with YTHDF2 and participate in m6A-containing RNA binding. The binding between PDE1A and YTHDF2 was verified, and PDE1A regulated the STAT3 pathway by interacting with YTHDF2. The mechanism of YTHDF2/PDE1A complex in regulating STAT3 pathway was predicted by overlapping YTHDF2-interacting-RNAs, and genes coexpressed with YTHDF2 and STAT3. The interactions between YTHDF2 and target mRNAs were predicted, and there were three predicted targets of YTHDF2 with high scores: NRF2, SOCS2, and MET. Indeed, PDE1A interacted with YTHDF2, destabilized SOCS2, and activated STAT3 pathway. This work not only uncovers a novel PDE1A/YTHDF2/STAT3 pathway in NSCLC progression but also provides therapeutic strategies for treating NSCLC patients with metastasis.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Lung cancer is one of the most frequently diagnosed cancers and the leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide <sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>]</sup>. Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) represents approximately 85% of lung cancers and is the most common subtype of lung cancer <sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>]</sup>. Despite rapid advances in the clinical treatment of NSCLC in recent years, the prognosis of NSCLC patients is still poor due to recurrence and distant metastasis <sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>]</sup>. However, the mechanism of NSCLC metastasis is still poorly understood.</p>
<p>Phosphodiesterases (PDEs) are a class of enzymes that hydrolyse cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), reducing the signaling of these important intracellular second messengers <sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>]</sup>. PDEs consist of 11 family members, and each family member contains multiple subtypes <sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>]</sup>. PDEs are being pursued as therapeutic targets in multiple diseases, including the cardiovascular system, metabolism, pulmonary system, nervous system, immunity, and cancers <sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>]</sup>. For example, PDE3 inhibitors are used to treat heart failure and peripheral artery disease, and PDE4 inhibitors are approved to treat inflammatory diseases <sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>]</sup>. Multiple studies have shown that PDEs, such as PDE4 and PDE5, play a vital role in the progression of tumors and are regarded as potential therapeutic targets for cancer treatment <sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>]</sup>. The PDE1 family member has three subtypes, including PDE1A, PDE1B and PDE1C, with different affinities for cAMP and cGMP <sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>]</sup>. The effect and mechanism of PDE1 in regulating cancer progression remain elusive.</p>
<p>N<sup>6</sup>-methyladenosine (m<sup>6</sup>A) is the most abundant RNA modification, and the process of m<sup>6</sup>A modification is reversible: m6A is installed by “writers”, removed by “erasers”, and recognized by “readers” <sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>]</sup>. YT521-B homology domain family member 2 (YTHDF2), belonging to the YTH domain protein family, has been validated as m<sup>6</sup>A “reader” and regulates the stability of messenger RNAs (mRNAs) <sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>]</sup>. YTHDF2 promotes the progression of lung adenocarcinoma by recognizing m6A modification and influencing mRNA fate <sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>]</sup>. Furthermore, YTHDF2 orchestrates the reprogramming of tumor-associated macrophages in the tumor microenvironment (TME), and YTHDF2 is an effective target to enhance cancer immunotherapy <sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>]</sup>. In this study, we first demonstrated that PDE1A promoted NSCLC metastasis via interacting with YTHDF2.</p>

<title>PDE1A overexpression predicts a poor prognosis in lung cancer patients</title>
<p>First, we found that PDE1A was highly expressed in lung cancer compared with normal lung tissue using immunohistochemistry (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref> and Figure S1) <sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>]</sup>. As shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>, overexpression of PDE1A was also observed in three NSCLC cell lines compared with normal human lung fibroblasts (HELF cells). Additionally, the overexpression of PDE1A was also observed in lung cancer from high-risk patients compared with low-risk patients (p&lt;0.0001, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>), and lung cancer patients in the high-risk group had shorter survival times than those in the low-risk group (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>) <sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>]</sup>.

<title>PDE1A promotes the metastasis and EMT of NSCLC cells both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic></title>
<p>To investigate the biological function of PDE1A in lung cancer development, gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) and overrepresentation enrichment analysis (ORA) were performed to analyze the biological process of PDE1A in NSCLC using LinkedOmics <sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>]</sup>. As shown in Figure S2A, PDE1A might be involved in the adhesion, migration, and motility of NSCLC cells, which are critical parameters in the metastatic dissemination of cancer cells. Tumor angiogenesis, the recruitment of new blood vessels, enables a pre-existing tumor to grow and metastasize <sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>]</sup>. PDE1A might also participate in mesenchyme development, angiogenesis, vasculature development, cellular response to VEGF stimulus, blood vessel morphogenesis and development (Figure S2A-C). Thus, we hypothesized that PDE1A might promote the metastatic potential of NSCLC cells.</p>
<p>First, PDE1A silencing did not cause a significant decrease in the proliferation of NSCLC cells relative to that in the control siRNA group (Figure S3A). Moreover, PDE1A overexpression had no significant effect on the proliferation of NSCLC cells (Figure S3B). As bioinformatics analysis demonstrated that PDE1A might promote the metastatic potential of NSCLC cells, wound healing and transwell assays were used to investigate the migration and invasion capacity of PDE1 family members. Knockdown of PDE1 family members suppressed the migratory ability of NCI-H1299 cells, and siPDE1A exerted a stronger suppression effect on the migration of NCI-H1299 cells than siPDE1B and siPDE1C transfection (Figure S4A). Meanwhile, siPDE1A resulted in more profound suppression of EMT progression in NCI-H1299 cells than siPDE1B and siPDE1C transfection (Figure S4B). Thus, PDE1 family members, particularly PDE1A, might be involved in the metastatic behavior of NSCLC cells.</p>
<p>As shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2B</xref>, suppression of PDE1A markedly reduced the migratory and invasive capacity of NSCLC cell lines, and the wound healing assay also showed that NSCLC cells with PDE1A knockdown had a slower wound closure rate than control siRNA-transfected cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2D</xref>). Furthermore, PDE1A knockdown increased E-cadherin expression and reduced N-cadherin expression, indicating that PDE1A silencing suppressed EMT progression in NSCLC cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>). Meanwhile, the PDE1 inhibitor vinpocetine significantly suppressed the migration and EMT of NSCLC cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F - H</xref>). To determine the effects of PDE1A on NSCLC cell migration and invasion <italic>in vivo</italic>, nude mouse models were established using PDE1A-shRNA- and control-shRNA-treated NCI-H1299 cells. As shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2I</xref> and Figure S4C-D, the number of pulmonary metastatic nodules was decreased in the PDE1A-shRNA group compared with the control-shRNA group in nude mice.</p>

<title>PDE1A promotes the metastasis of NSCLC cells via the STAT3 signaling pathway</title>
<p>Then, we investigated whether PDE1A-enhanced metastasis was dependent on cAMP metabolism activity. As shown in Figure S6A, the cAMP inhibitor SQ22536 failed to rescue the migrative ability suppressed by siPDE1A in NSCLC cells, indicating that the basic molecular function might not be involved in the metastasis of PDE1A. To better explore the mechanism of PDE1A in NSCLC progression, we performed bioinformatic analysis of PDE1A coexpressed genes, which revealed that PDE1A might be involved in the JAK/STAT3, Hedgehog, and TGF-β pathways in NSCLC (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). Meanwhile, GSEA enrichment analysis demonstrated that PDE1A might participate in IL-6 production (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>), thus we hypothesized that IL-6/JAK/STAT3 signaling might be involved in PDE1A-promoted metastasis in NSCLC. As shown in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>, PDE1A overexpression increased the phosphorylation level of STAT3 in NSCLC cells. In contrast, PDE1A knockdown or the PDE1 inhibitor vinpocetine suppressed the phosphorylation of STAT3 in NSCLC cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5E</xref>). Moreover, STAT3 suppression by siRNA or SH-4-54 significantly reversed the enhancement of NSCLC cell migration induced by PDE1A overexpression (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5F</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5G</xref>). In addition, the suppression of STAT3 inhibited PDE1A-induced EMT progression in NSCLC cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5H</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5I</xref>). Thus, PDE1A promoted the metastasis of NSCLC cells via activating the STAT3 signaling pathway, but the direct interaction between PDE1A and STAT3 could not be observed in NSCLC cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5J</xref>).

<title>PDE1A physically interacts with YTHDF2 and promotes the metastasis of NSCLC cells</title>
<p>To investigate the mechanism by which PDE1A promotes NSCLC metastasis and activates the STAT3 pathway, the proteins interacting with PDE1A in NSCLC were determined using immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometry analysis (Table S3). To identify the key proteins involved in PDE1A-mediated STAT3 activation, we generated a Venn diagram, which showed that there were 9 overlapping genes among those coexpressed with STAT3 in NSCLC clinical samples, PDE1A-interacting proteins, and overexpressed in NSCLC compared with normal tissues (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>). Meanwhile, GO enrichment analysis of PDE1A interacting genes was used to predict the molecular function of PDE1A, and PDE1A might participate in m6A-containing RNA binding in NSCLC progression (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>). Thus, we hypothesized that PDE1A might interact with YTHDF2 and participate in m6A-containing RNA binding during NSCLC progression.

<title>PDE1A interacts with YTHDF2 to regulate the SOCS2/STAT3 signaling pathway</title>
<p>To gain mechanistic insights regarding the key target mRNA by which the PDE1A/YTHDF2 complex regulates the STAT3 signaling pathway, we generated a Venn diagram, which showed that there were 33 overlapping genes among RNAs that physically interact with YTHDF2, YTHDF2-coexpressed genes, and STAT3-coexpressed genes in lung cancer (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A</xref> and Table S4) <sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>]</sup>. Then, the interactions between the YTHDF2 protein and the mRNAs of 33 overlapping genes were predicted by RNA-Protein Interaction Prediction online tool.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>NSCLC is becoming a leading cause of death globally due to its fast progression and metastatic potential, and effective therapeutic targets are urgently needed to block NSCLC metastasis <sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>]</sup>. PDEs are regarded as therapeutic targets for multiple diseases, but the feasibility of targeting PDEs to treat NSCLC metastasis may need further investigation <sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>]</sup>. In this study, we showed for the first time that PDE1 promoted metastasis and EMT progression in NSCLC cells. Furthermore, the expression of PDE1A was closely correlated with the disease progression of NSCLC. These data first indicated with PDE1A might be an efficacious therapeutic target for patients with metastatic NSCLC.</p>
<p>The stimulation of the PDEs requires physiological concentrations of Ca<sup>2+</sup> and calmodulin, and Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin-dependent cyclic nucleotide PDE1 is involved in the communication between the cyclic nucleotide and Ca<sup>2+</sup> second messenger systems <sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>]</sup>. The increasing of Ca<sup>2+</sup> in cancer cells stimulates exosome biogenesis and release under both physiological and pathological conditions <sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>]</sup>. In this context, we assumed that PDE1A might be involved in exosome biogenesis and release in NSCLC cells and play a vital role in message communication in the TME. GSEA showed that PDE1A might be involved in angiogenesis, vasculature development, and blood vessel development. Indeed, NSCLC cells overexpressing PDE1A promoted angiogenesis in the TME, and PDE1A knockdown significantly suppressed angiogenesis of NSCLC <italic>in vivo</italic>. Furthermore, an exosome release inhibitor successfully reversed the angiogenesis promoted by NSCLC cells overexpressing PDE1A. Thus, this study first illustrated that PDEs might play an important role in angiogenesis and the TME via regulating exosome biogenesis and release in cancer cells.</p>
<p>During our attempt to reveal the downstream signaling pathway of PDE1A, we found that the IL-6/JAK/STAT3 signaling pathway was highly enriched in PDE1A co-expressed genes from NSCLC. Furthermore, PDE1A promoted the metastasis of NSCLC cells via the STAT3 signaling pathway. Targeting the IL-6/JAK/STAT3 signaling pathway is considered as a promising therapeutic strategy for the management of NSCLC <sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>]</sup>. However, the direct interaction between PDE1A and STAT3 could not be observed in NSCLC cells. Thus, we next explored the mechanism by which PDE1A promotes the STAT3 signaling pathway. In our study, we demonstrated that PDE1A interacted with YTHDF2 and participated in NSCLC progression, and our data first verified the interaction between YTHDF2 and PDE1A in NSCLC cells. Meanwhile, YTHDF2 might act as an m6A RNA “reader” by interacting with PDE1A, but the mechanism might need further investigation. YTHDF2 destabilizes mRNAs via degrading target transcripts, but it also stabilizes important oncogenic drivers, such as <italic>MYC</italic> and <italic>VEGFA</italic> transcripts, in an m6A-dependent manner <sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>]</sup>. We demonstrated that YTHDF2 destabilized SOCS2 mRNA via interacting with PDE1A, but the mechanism by which YTHDF2 sorts mRNA might need further investigation. In addition, it is worth testing if PDE1A inhibition affects metastasis in lung cancer models and sensitizes cisplatin in resistant NSCLC cells in vitro and in vivo. The role of YTHDF2 in PDE1A-driven tumor metastasis should be elucidated in future studies.</p>
<p>Collectively, the results of this study suggest that PDE1A promotes metastasis in NSCLC cells. Furthermore, PDE1A overexpression is correlated with angiogenesis and poor outcomes of NSCLC patients. In addition, PDE1A interacts with YTHDF2 and regulates the JAK/STAT3 signaling pathway via degrading SOCS2 mRNA. Therefore, this study reveals the effect and mechanism of PDE1A in promoting NSCLC metastasis, this work not only uncovers a novel PDE1A/YTHDF2/STAT3 signaling pathway in NSCLC progression but also provides novel therapeutic strategies to treat NSCLC patients with metastasis.</p>

<p>Summary</p>
<p>This revised manuscript investigates the role and the mechanism by which PDE1 impacts NSCLC progression. They provide evidence to demonstrate that PDE1 binds to m6A reader YTHDF2, in turn, regulating STAT3 signaling pathway through its interaction, promoting metastasis and angiogenesis.</p>
<p>Strength:</p>
<p>The study uncovers a novel PDE1A/YTHDF2/SOCS2/STAT3 pathway in NSCLC progression and the findings provide a potential treatment strategy for NSCLC patients with metastasis.</p>
<p>Weakness:</p>
<p>In discussion, it is stated in the revised version that &quot;the role of YTHDF2 in PDE1A-driven tumor metastasis should be elucidated in future studies&quot;, however, given that physical interaction of PDE1A and YTHDF2 plays a critical role in PDE1A-mediated NSCLC metastasis, whether YTHDF2 mimicking the effect of PDE1A in metastasis will strength the manuscript.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p>

<p><bold>Public Reviews:</bold></p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The manuscript entitled &quot;Phosphodiesterase 1A Physically Interacts with YTHDF2 and Reinforces the Progression of Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer&quot; explores the role of PDE1A in promoting NSCLC progression by binding to the m6A reader YTHDF2 and regulating the mRNA stability of several novel target genes, consequently activating the STAT3 pathway and leading to metastasis and drug resistance.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The study addresses a novel mechanism involving PDE1A and YTHDF2 interaction in NSCLC, contributing to our understanding of cancer progression.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The following issues should be addressed:</p>
<p>(1) The body weight changes and/or survival times of each group in the in vivo metastasis studies should be provided.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your suggestion! We have already provided the body weight of each group in the in vivo metastasis studies in FigureS4D and FigureS5D (see below).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) In Figure 7, the direct binding between YTHDF2 and the potential target genes should be further validated by silencing YTHDF2 to observe the half-life of the mRNA levels of target genes, in addition to silencing PDE1A.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your suggestion! We have found that siYTHDF2 does not significantly affect expression of <italic>SOCS2</italic> in NSCLC cells (see author response image 1 below). We hypothesize that YTHDF2 functions as a m6A reader to recognize the target mRNA, thus if YTHDF2 is silence by siRNA, there is still some expression in the cells, allowing it to continue recognizing and exerting its function. Therefore, the mRNA of <italic>SOCS2</italic> could not significantly affect expressed. However, PDE1A functions as a degrader of mRNA, thus when it is disrupted, the mRNA degradation effect could be strong.</p>

<p>(3) In Figure 7, the potential methylation sites of &quot;A&quot; on the target genes such as SOCS2 should be verified by mutation analysis, followed by m6A IP or reporter assays.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your suggestion! The m6A IP or reporter assays may be carried out to detect the potential methylation sites in future. We have added the suggestion in manuscript “Meanwhile, YTHDF2 might act as an m6A RNA “reader” by interacting with PDE1A, but the mechanism might need further investigation”.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) In Figure 6G, the correlation between the mRNA levels of STAT3 and YTHDF2 needs clarification. According to the authors' mechanism, the STAT3 pathway is activated, rather than upregulation of mRNA levels (or protein levels, as shown in Figure 6F). Figure 7 does not provide evidence that STAT3 is a bona fide target gene regulated by YTHDF2.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your suggestion! The reviewer is right, STAT3 pathway is activated, rather than upregulation of mRNA levels by YTHDF2, so the relationship between YTHDF2 mRNA and STAT3 mRNA is not suitable for this study. Meanwhile, the relationship between YTHDF2 mRNA and STAT3 mRNA is not as strong as we expected with Pearson value 0.37. Thus, we have already deleted Figure 6G in the revised version.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) The final figure, which discusses sensitization to cisplatin by PDE1A suppression, does not appear to be closely related to the interaction or regulation of PDE1A/YTHDF2. If the authors claim this is an m6A-associated event, additional evidence is needed. Otherwise, this part could be removed from the manuscript.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your suggestion! We have already deleted Figure 8 just as the reviewer suggested.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>This manuscript aims to investigate the biological impact and mechanisms of phosphodiesterase 1A (PDE1A) in promoting non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) progression. They first analyzed several databases and used three established NSCLC cell lines and a normal cell line to demonstrate that PDE1A is overexpressed in lung cancer and its expression negatively correlated with the outcomes of patients. Based on this data, they suggested PDE1A could be considered as a novel prognostic predictor in lung cancer treatment and progression. To study the biological function of PDE1A in NSCLC, they focused on testing the effect of inhibition of PDE1A genetically and pharmacologically on cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in vitro. They also used an experimental metastasis model via tail vein injection of H1299 cells to test if PDE1A promoted metastasis. By database analysis, they also decided to investigate if PDE1A promoted angiogenesis by co-culturing NSCLC cells with HUVECs as well as assessing the tumors from the subcutaneous xenograft model. However, in this model, whether PDE1A modulation impacted tumor metastasis was not examined. To address the mechanism of how PDE1A promotes metastasis, the authors again performed a bioinformatic and GSEA enrichment analysis and confirmed PDE1A indeed activated STAT3 signaling to promote migration. In combination with IP followed by Mass spectrometry, they found PDE1A is a partner of YTHDF2, the cooperation of PDE1A and YTHDF2 negatively regulated SOCS2 mRNA as demonstrated by RIP assay, and ultimately activated STAT3 signaling. Finally, the authors shifted the direction from metastasis to chemoresistance, specifically, they found that PDEA1 inhibitions sensitized NSCLC cells to cisplatin through MET and NRF2 signaling.</p>
<p>Strength:</p>
<p>Overall, the manuscript was well-written and the majority of the data supported the conclusions. The authors used a series of methods including cell lines, animal models, and database analysis to demonstrate the novel roles and mechanism of how PDE1 promotes NSCLC invasion and metastasis as well as cisplatin sensitivity. Given that PDE1A inhibitors have been perused to use in clinic, this study provided valuable findings that have the translational potential for NSCLC treatment.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The role of YTHDF2 in PDE1A-promoted tumor metastasis was not investigated. To make the findings more clinical and physiologically relevant, it would be interesting to test if inhibition of PDE1A impacts metastasis using lung cancer orthotopic and patient-derived xenograft models. It is also important to use a cisplatin-resistant NSCLC cell line to test if a PDE1A inhibitor has the potential to sensitize cisplatin in vitro and in vivo.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your suggestion! The role of YTHDF2 in PDE1A-promoted tumor metastasis may need in vivo analysis. Therefore, we discussed the point in the discussion section “In addition, it is worth testing if PDE1A inhibition affects metastasis in lung cancer orthotopic and patient-derived xenograft models. The role of YTHDF2 in PDE1A-driven tumor metastasis should be elucidated in future studies”.</p>
<p>The reviewer is absolutely right, it is very important to use a cisplatin-resistant NSCLC cell line to test the potential effect of PDE1A in sensitization to cisplatin. The current data could not support the conclusion, more data is needed to make the final conclusion. As suggested by reviewer 1, we have deleted these data in this version.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Furthermore, this study relied heavily on different database analyses, although providing novel and compelling data that was followed up and confirmed in the paper, it is critical to have detailed statistical description section on data acquisition throughout the manuscript.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your suggestion! We have already added the detailed statistical description section in Figure legends.</p>

<p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p>
<p>(1) Scale Bar Display: Scale bars should be included in Figures 4F, 5F, and 6E to ensure clarity and accuracy in the presented microscopic images.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your suggestion! We have already added the scale bars on Figures 4F, 5F, and 6E.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) HE Staining Images: The authors are suggested to provide more images for HE staining of lungs to offer a comprehensive visual representation and to substantiate the findings.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your suggestion! We have already provided more images for HE staining of lungs in Figure S4E and Figure S5E.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p>
<p>It would be helpful to clarify several points in the manuscript for better understanding.</p>
<p>(1)The HELF cells were stated between the epithelial cell line (page 7, line 118) and fibroblast (page 12, line 288) which needs to be clarified. It is not clear if the cells used in this study were periodically authenticated.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your suggestion! We have already revised the expression of HELF cells, and it is actually the human lung fibroblasts.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) More details could be added to the methods such as the amount of Matrigel coated for invasion assay and the components for the lysis buffer and IP buffer.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your suggestion! We have already added more details in the Methods section.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) Providing the rationale for using 20% FBS instead of using some chemoattracts such as EGF, LPA, or HGF or a low level of FBS for migration will be helpful.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your suggestion! Although chemoattracts are suitable for cell migration experiment, and 20% FBS is also suitable for cell migration experiment. We listed the literatures using this system below for example.</p>

<p>(4) For HPA analysis In Figure 1, it would be great to assess how many lung cancer cases are NSCLC and define IDO/area for the y-axis.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your suggestion! There are 19 samples were analyzed, they are all NSCLC sample, and we have already revised our manuscript accordingly. Meanwhile, we also made a mistake, it should be IOD/area which means Integral optical density/area. We have revised the Figures and Figure legends.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) On page 23, line 480, &quot;Therefore, this study reveals the effect and mechanism of PDEA1 in promoting HCC metastasis...&quot;, should HCC be NSCLC?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your suggestion! We have already revised the manuscript accordingly.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(6) Specific scramble siRNAs should be clearly shown in their respective figures. In Figure 7F, it is not clear why DMSO did not scramble siRNA was used as the control.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your suggestion! It is our fault to show the DMSO in Figure 5F, DMSO is the negative control of Figure 5G, and we have revised the Figure 5F and 5G accordingly.</p>
