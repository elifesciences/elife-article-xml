<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Tissue-resident memory T cells (T<sub>RM</sub>) protect from repeated infections within organs and barrier sites. The breadth and duration of such protection is defined at minimum by three quantities; the rate at which new T<sub>RM</sub> are generated from precursors, their rate of self-renewal, and their loss rate through death, egress, or differentiation. Quantifying these processes in isolation is challenging. Here we combine genetic fate mapping tools and mathematical models to untangle these basic homeostatic properties of CD4<sup>+</sup> T<sub>RM</sub> in skin and lamina propria (LP) of healthy adult mice. We show that CD69<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> T<sub>RM</sub> in skin reside for <italic>∼</italic> 24 days and self-renew more slowly, such that clones halve in size approximately every 5 weeks; and approximately 2% of cells are replaced daily from precursors. CD69<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> T<sub>RM</sub> in LP have shorter residencies (∼ 14 days) and are maintained largely by immigration (4-6% per day). We also find evidence that the constitutive replacement of CD69<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> T<sub>RM</sub> at both sites derives from circulating effector-memory CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, in skin possibly via a CD69<sup>−</sup> intermediate. Our integrated approach maps the ontogeny of CD4<sup>+</sup> T<sub>RM</sub> in skin and LP and exposes their dynamic and distinct behaviours, with continual seeding and erosion potentially impacting the duration of immunity at these sites.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Resident memory T cells (T<sub>RM</sub>) provide immune surveillance and protection in tissues and mucosal surfaces through-out the body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Szabo <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>), but the mechanisms by which they are maintained are not well understood. Conventional CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T<sub>RM</sub> in mice and humans are not intrinsically long-lived, but appear to self-renew slowly as assessed by readouts of cell division such Ki67 expression or BrdU incorporation, at levels that vary across tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Gebhardt <italic>et al</italic>., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Watanabe <italic>et al</italic>., 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Park <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Strobl <italic>et al</italic>., 2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Divito <italic>et al</italic>., 2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Christo <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>). After infection or immune challenge, the numbers of elicited T<sub>RM</sub> may also be sustained by influx from precursor populations, although the extent to which this occurs is unclear, and is likely also cell subset- and tissue-dependent. For example, in the lung there is evidence both for (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Zammit <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Ely <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Slütter <italic>et al</italic>., 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Van Braeckel-Budimir <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Takamura and Kohlmeier, 2019</xref>) and against (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Takamura <italic>et al</italic>., 2016</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">van Dorp <italic>et al</italic>., 2024</xref>) ongoing recruitment of new T<sub>RM</sub> following respiratory virus infections. Within skin, T<sub>RM</sub> may be renewed or supplemented slowly from precursors in the setting of graft-versus-host disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Divito <italic>et al</italic>., 2020</xref>), and from circulating central memory T<sub>CM</sub> or effector memory T<sub>EM</sub> following infection or sensitisation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Gaide <italic>et al</italic>., 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Matos <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>). In the small intestine, however, resident CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T<sub>RM</sub> appear to persist for months to years with slow self-renewal without appreciable influx (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Bartolomé-Casado <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>, <xref rid="c5" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>).</p>
<p>The dynamics of production and loss of T<sub>RM</sub> in the steady state are even less well understood, and measuring these processes is important for several reasons. The balance of loss and self-renewal defines the persistence of clonal populations and hence the duration of protective immunity. Further, while self-renewal can at best preserve clonal diversity within a tissue site, any supplementation or replacement by immigrant T<sub>RM</sub> will perturb the local TCR repertoire. In particular, any significant influx into T<sub>RM</sub> niches in the absence of overt infection may be a competitive force, potentially reducing the persistence T<sub>RM</sub> previously established in response to infection or challenge.</p>
<p>The kinetics of circulating memory T cells have been quantified extensively in both mice and humans, using dye dilution assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Choo <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>), deuterium labelling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Westera <italic>et al</italic>., 2013</xref>, <xref rid="c39" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">del Amo <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Baliu-Piqué <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>, <xref rid="c2" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">van den Berg <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>), and BrdU labelling, either alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Younes <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Ganusov and De Boer, 2013</xref>) or in combination with fate reporters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Gossel <italic>et al</italic>., 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Hogan <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bullock <italic>et al</italic>., 2024</xref>) or T cell receptor excision circles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">den Braber <italic>et al</italic>., 2012</xref>). Using mathematical models to interpret these data, these studies identified rates of production, cellular lifespans, and signatures of heterogeneity in turnover. Modelling has also established evidence for continuous replenishment of circulating memory CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells from precursors throughout life in specific-pathogen-free mice, driven by a combination of environmental, commensal and self antigens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Gossel <italic>et al</italic>., 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Hogan <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bullock <italic>et al</italic>., 2024</xref>). Quantification of T<sub>RM</sub> dynamics has to date been restricted largely to measuring the net persistence of CD8<sup>+</sup> T<sub>RM</sub> following infection in mice, in a variety of tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Morris <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Wijeyesinghe <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>). Far less is known regarding CD4<sup>+</sup> T<sub>RM</sub>, which typically outnumber their CD8<sup>+</sup> counterparts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Szabo <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>), and there have been very few attempts to dissect the kinetics of either subset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">van Dorp <italic>et al</italic>., 2024</xref>).</p>
<p>In general, measuring these basic parameters in isolation is challenging, partly due to their sensitivity to assumptions made in the models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">De Boer and Perelson, 2013</xref>), but also because division-linked labelling alone may not distinguish <italic>in situ</italic> cell division and the supplementation of a population from labelled precursors. A more powerful approach is to triangulate information from different readouts of cell fate simultaneously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Bains <italic>et al</italic>., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">den Braber <italic>et al</italic>., 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">del Amo <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">De Boer and Yates, 2023</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bullock <italic>et al</italic>., 2024</xref>).</p>
<p>With these challenges in mind, here we integrated data from two independent inducible fate reporter systems to study CD4<sup>+</sup> T<sub>RM</sub> homeostasis in mice. Each system allows one to track the fates of defined populations of cells and their descendants. One labels all CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell subsets at any given moment, which effectively provides an age ‘timestamp’. The other labels cells undergoing cell division within defined time windows. In combination, these systems allowed us to establish a quantitative model of the basal homeostatic properties of CD4<sup>+</sup> T<sub>RM</sub> within the skin and the lamina propria of the small intestine in healthy mice. In particular, we could unpick the contributions of self renewal and <italic>de novo</italic> cell production that underpin their maintenance, and explore their lineage relationships to circulating T cell subsets.</p>

<title>Combining cell fate reporters and models to measure T<sub>RM</sub> replacement, loss, and self-renewal</title>
<p>To study the homeostatic dynamics of tissue resident CD4<sup>+</sup> memory T cells in healthy mice, we used in concert two genetic fate mapping tools in which cohorts of peripheral T cells and their offspring can be induced to express permanent fluorescent markers (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). These reporter strains were previously used separately to study the turnover of naive and circulating memory T and B cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Verheijen <italic>et al</italic>., 2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Lukas <italic>et al</italic>., 2023</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bullock <italic>et al</italic>., 2024</xref>). In the Ki67<sup>mCherry-CreERT</sup> Rosa26<sup>RcagYFP</sup> system, henceforth Ki67-DIVN, fluorescent reporters are linked to the expression of Ki67, a nuclear protein that is expressed during cell division and for 3 to 4 days afterwards (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Gossel <italic>et al</italic>., 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Miller <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>). Specifically, these mice express both a Ki67-mCherry fusion protein and inducible CreERT from the <italic>Mki67</italic> locus, together with a <italic>Rosa26</italic><sup><italic>RcagYFP</italic></sup> Cre reporter construct. Treatment of mice with tamoxifen therefore induces YFP in cells expressing high levels of Ki67, and YFP is then stably expressed by these cells and their offspring. Expression of Ki67-used mCherry gives a constitutive live readout of Ki67 expression, independent of tamoxifen treatment and YFP expression. In the second fate reporter, CD4<sup>CreERT</sup> Rosa26<sup>RmTom</sup> mice (Cd4-FR), the Cre reporter is constructed such that cells expressing CD4 during tamoxifen treatment permanently and heritably express the fluorescent reporter mTomato (mTom).</p>

New cells enter a T<sub>RM</sub> subset in skin or LP (the ‘target’ population) from a precursor population at rate <italic>θ</italic> (cells per unit time). YFP and mTom expression among immigrant cells is assumed to be that of the precursor population in bulk. We considered three possibilities for the Ki67 expression levels among new immigrants; a ‘quiescent’ mode (all Ki67<sup>low</sup>), ‘neutral’ recruitment (Ki67<sup>high</sup> frequency identical to that of the precursor). or ‘division-linked’ (all recruited cells Ki67<sup>high</sup>). The target cells are assumed to be a kinetically homogeneous population that self-renews at average rate <italic>ρ</italic>, such that their mean interdivision time is 1<italic>/ρ</italic>. Cells are also lost through death, differentiation or tissue egress at rate <italic>δ</italic>, implying a mean residence time of 1<italic>/δ</italic>. The combination of these processes determines the timecourses of frequencies of YFP<sup>+</sup> and mTom<sup>+</sup> cells with the target population. <bold>C</bold> Experimental design.</p></caption>

</fig>
<p>In a closed population of cells at steady state, self-renewal must be balanced by loss and so, following tamoxifen treatment, the frequencies of cells expressing YFP or mTom within any such population would remain constant. Therefore, any decline in the frequency of either reporter among T<sub>RM</sub> after treatment must derive from the influx of label-negative cells from an upstream (precursor) population. In the Ki67-DIVN mice, these will be descendants of cells that were not dividing at the time of tamoxifen treatment; in the Cd4-FR mice, labelled CD4<sup>+</sup> cells will slowly be replaced by the descendants of those generated in the thymus after treatment. The shape of this decline will be determined by the combination of the net loss rate of T<sub>RM</sub> from the tissue (through death, egress, or differentiation, offset by any self-renewal), and the label content of immigrant T<sub>RM</sub> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>). To refer to the persistence of individual T<sub>RM</sub> cells we will use the term ‘residence time’ rather than lifespan, to reflect the multiple potential mechanisms of loss from tissues.</p>
<p>To quantify these processes, we treated cohorts of both reporter mice, aged between 4 and 15 weeks, with single 2mg pulses of tamoxifen (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>). Over 9 week (Ki67 reporter) and 57 week (CD4 reporter) chase periods we measured the frequencies of labelled cells among antigen-experienced CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell subsets isolated from skin and the lamina propria of the small intestine (henceforth LP), and within circulating naive and memory T cell subsets derived from lymph nodes (Fig. S1A). By combining these frequencies with measures of Ki67 expression, and describing the resulting set of time series with simple mathematical models, we aimed to estimate the basic parameters underlying T<sub>RM</sub> kinetics.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2b">
<title>CD4<sup>+</sup> T<sub>RM</sub> in skin and lamina propria are continuously replaced from precursors</title>
<p>We considered two populations within both skin and LP, identified as tissue-localised by virtue of their protection from short-term <italic>in vivo</italic> labelling (Methods; Fig. S1B). One was effector-memory (EM) phenotype (CD4<sup>+</sup>CD44<sup>hi</sup> CD62L<sup>lo</sup>) T cells in bulk, which we studied in order to gain the broadest possible picture of memory cell dynamics at these sites. We also considered the subset of these cells that expressed CD69, a canonical and consistent marker of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell residency across multiple tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Szabo <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>). We saw no significant changes with mouse age in the numbers of either population within skin (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>, <italic>p</italic> &gt;0.67) or LP (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>, <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.39). There were also no significant changes in any of these quantities with time since tamoxifen treatment (<italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.24). We therefore assumed that the skin- and LP-localised T cell subsets we considered were at, or close to, homeostatic equilibrium during the chase period. For brevity, we refer to tissue-localised CD4<sup>+</sup>CD44<sup>hi</sup>CD62L<sup>lo</sup> in bulk as EM, and the CD69<sup>+</sup> subset as T<sub>RM</sub>.</p>

</fig>
<p>During the first few days after tamoxifen treatment, YFP and mTom expression increased continuously within the skin and LP subsets (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>), as well as among CD4<sup>+</sup> naive (CD44<sup>lo</sup> CD62L<sup>hi</sup>), central memory (T<sub>CM</sub>, CD44<sup>hi</sup> CD62L<sup>hi</sup>) and effector memory (T<sub>EM</sub>, CD44<sup>hi</sup> CD62L<sup>lo</sup>) T cells recovered from lymph nodes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>). These initial increases were driven in part by the intracellular dynamics of the induction of the fluorescent reporters. We therefore began our analyses at day 5 post-treatment, by which time induction was considered complete and the subsequent trajectories of label frequencies reflected only the dynamic processes of cell production and loss. A key observation was that mTom expression within the skin and LP subsets then declined slowly (roughly 7-to 8-fold over the course of a year, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>), indicating immediately that these populations were being continuously replaced from precursors. Early in the chase period YFP<sup>+</sup> T<sub>RM</sub> expressed Ki67 at higher levels than YFP<sup>−</sup> cells, as expected, but Ki67 expression in the two populations converged at later times. We return to the interpretation of these kinetics below.</p>
<p>We then investigated the extent to which the simple model illustrated in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref> could explain these trajectories. Given the observation of continued recruitment, any time-variation in the label content of T<sub>RM</sub> precursors might leave an imprint on the label kinetics of skin or LP T<sub>RM</sub> themselves, and thereby help us to identify their developmental pathways. We reasoned that plausible T<sub>RM</sub> precursors might be LN-derived CD4<sup>+</sup> naive, T<sub>CM</sub> or T<sub>EM</sub>; we also considered the possibilities that CD69<sup>−</sup> cells within skin and LP are the direct precursors of the local CD69<sup>+</sup> populations. Therefore, we used empirical functions to describe the timecourses of the frequencies of YFP<sup>+</sup> and mTom<sup>+</sup> cells within these five populations (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>, black curves), and used them in turn as inputs to the model of YFP and mTom kinetics within the tissues.</p>
<p>For each tissue subset (‘target’) and precursor pair, we fitted the model simultaneously to six timecourses; the frequencies of (i) YFP expression and (ii) mTom expression among target cells, the proportions of Ki67<sup>high</sup> cells among (iii) YFP<sup>+</sup> and (iv) YFP<sup>−</sup> target cells, and the (v) YFP and (vi) mTom expression kinetics within the precursor (Methods and Supporting Information Text S1). For each precursor/target pair we considered three modes of influx – one in which new immigrant T<sub>RM</sub> are Ki67<sup>low</sup> (‘quiescent’ recruitment); another in which their Ki67 expression directly reflects that of the precursor (‘neutral’ recruitment), and a third in which immigrants have recently divided (Ki67<sup>high</sup>), perhaps through an antigen-driven process (‘division-linked’ recruitment).</p>

<title>Skin and LP CD4<sup>+</sup> T<sub>RM</sub> have similar residence times but exhibit distinct contributions of replacement and self-renewal</title>
<p>For each precursor and mode of recruitment, we were able to estimate rates of influx, residence times and interdivision times (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> and Table S1). Overall, we found that the residence times of both EM and T<sub>RM</sub> within skin and LP were around 3 weeks and 2 weeks respectively. The means of production of new cells differed at the two sites, however. In skin, around 2% of both populations were replaced daily by influx, comparable to the rates of constitutive replacement of circulating memory CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell subsets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Gossel <italic>et al</italic>., 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Hogan <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bullock <italic>et al</italic>., 2024</xref>), and self-renewed every 6 and 7 weeks respectively, In contrast, within LP these subsets divided less often (every 7-9 weeks) and relied on higher levels of recruitment (4-6% per day) for their maintenance.</p>

For each precursor/target pair, we considered three potential levels of Ki67 expression on immigrant cells (L-R; orange, red, and blue violin plots). ‘High’, the division-linked model (new cells enter as Ki67<sup>high</sup>); ‘Int’, neutral model (Ki67 expression among new cells mirrors that of the precursor); and ‘Low’, the quiescent model (new cells enter as Ki67<sup>low</sup>).

<p>From these basic quantities we could derive several other important measures of T<sub>RM</sub> behaviour. First, the balance of the rates of loss (<italic>δ</italic>) and self-renewal (<italic>ρ</italic>) defines the persistence of a cohort of T cells, which is distinct from the lifepan of its constituent cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">del Amo <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">De Boer and Yates, 2023</xref>). Specifically, the quantity ln(2)/(<italic>δ</italic>− <italic>ρ</italic>) is the average time taken for a cohort and their descendents to halve in number. While we studied polyclonal populations here, this quantity applies equally well to measuring the persistence of a TCR clonotype, so we refer to it as a clonal half life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bullock <italic>et al</italic>., 2024</xref>). The substantial rates of self-renewal in skin led to clonal half lives of just over a month. The lower levels of self-renewal and higher levels of replacement in LP resulted in shorter clonal half-lives of 2 weeks.</p>
<p>Importantly, our estimates of these quantities depended to varying degrees on the choice of precursor and mode of recruitment (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). For example, intuitively, given the observed level of Ki67 within each target population, the greater the levels of Ki67 within newly recruited cells, the less must derive from self-renewal; hence, if one assumes that recruitment is division-linked, estimated division rates are reduced. Similarly, as discussed above, the label content of the precursor influences the net loss rate of label in the target, which was most clearly reflected in the loss of mTom<sup>+</sup> cells over the longer chase period (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">D</xref>). For example, mTom was lost most rapidly within naive CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>), due to export of label-negative cells from the thymus. Models in which naive T cells were the direct precursor of T<sub>RM</sub> therefore predicted greater clonal persistence within tissues.</p>
<p>We saw very little decline in YFP expression levels during the 2 month chase period (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>), due in part to the sustained levels of YFP within the putative precursor populations (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>), which ‘topped up’ YFP-expressing T<sub>RM</sub>. As a result, YFP kinetics within the tissues was not strongly informative regarding rates of replacement. However, the rate of convergence of Ki67 within YFP<sup>+</sup> and YFP<sup>−</sup> cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>) put clear constraints on the duration of Ki67 expression, which at approximately 3 days (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>) was consistent with previous estimates. This quantity in turn was informative for estimating rates of self-renewal. Further, the observed convergence of Ki67 within these two subsets is consistent with the basic model assumption of homogeneity in the rates of division and loss within skin and LP.</p>

<p>To more precisely quantify the kinetics of each target population, we assessed the relative support for each combination of precursor and mode of recruitment (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>).

</fig>
<p>From the candidate set, the weighting strongly favoured a lymph-node derived EM as the closest precursor to CD4<sup>+</sup> EM within both skin and LP. However, within skin, CD69<sup>−</sup> cells were the favoured precursor to CD69<sup>+</sup> T<sub>RM</sub>. The evidence was more equivocal regarding the mode in which cells are recruited into skin and LP, although for skin we saw substantial evidence (66% of model support) for a division-linked transition from CD69<sup>−</sup> to CD69<sup>+</sup> cells. <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref> summarises the developmental trajectories and kinetics of T<sub>RM</sub> in skin and LP that were supported most strongly by our analyses.

<sec id="s2e">
<title>Validation of residence times through use of Ki67 expression directly</title>
<p>As a consistency check, when a population is at or close to steady state, bounds on the mean residence time of cells can be estimated using only the measured frequency of Ki67 within the target population, and the daily rate of replacement (Supporting Information, Text S2). In skin, both EM and T<sub>RM</sub> are replaced at the rate of 2% per day, and have Ki67 expression frequencies of around 0.15 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>). The approximation then yields residence times in the range 22-28 days, depending on whether immigrant T<sub>RM</sub> are Ki67<sup>low</sup> or Ki67<sup>high</sup> respectively. In LP, with 5.5% daily replacement and Ki67 frequencies of around 0.07, we estimate residence times of 14-25 days. Both estimates are in good agreement with those from the model fitting. Further validation of these results, and dissection of the kinetics, might be achieved my manipulating cell trafficking, although this would potentially impact multiple processes at once. For example, treating mice with the sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor agonist FTY720 would block tissue ingress and egress. This would leave self-renewal as the only means of T<sub>RM</sub> production, and would also remove the component of the cell loss rate that is due to cells leaving the tissue. In principle one could then gain estimates of the intrinsic lifespan of T<sub>RM</sub>, rather than their tissue residence time. However, parameter estimation would then require accurate measurements of cell numbers within the tissue.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our analysis indicates that CD4<sup>+</sup> T<sub>RM</sub> are not intrinsically long-lived, but instead are sustained by both self-renewal and supplementation from circulating precursors. By combining fate reporting methods with mathematical models, we also showed that it is possible to separately quantify the processes that underlie their persistence. We saw quite distinct contributions of recruitment and self-renewal of both subsets within skin and LP. The basis of this difference is unclear, but we speculate that the large antigenic burden within the small intestine drives the higher levels of T<sub>RM</sub> recruitment and clonal erosion within the lamina propria. We showed that the precise values of these quantities depend on the identity of any precursor, whose label kinetics propagate downstream into the population of interest; and the extent of any cell division that occurs around the time of differentiation or ingress. However, by using simple, easily interpretable mathematical models, and assessing the statistical support for each, we were able to identify different pathways and modes of recruitment into each subset.</p>
<p>Our analysis was rooted in the observation of steady-state numbers of CD4<sup>+</sup> subsets within these tissues, which dictates that immigration of new cells must be accompanied by loss of existing cells. Estimates of residence times may be quite different if homeostatic niches are flexible in size. For example, repeated vaccinia virus challenges can drive progressive increases in the numbers of virus-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T<sub>RM</sub> in skin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Jiang <italic>et al</italic>., 2012</xref>), and heterologous challenges appear not to erode pre-existing LCMV-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T<sub>RM</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Wijeyesinghe <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>). Whether the same principles apply to CD4<sup>+</sup> T<sub>RM</sub> following repeated challenges is unclear.</p>
<p>Our goal here was to assess the support for external replenishment of effector-memory-like CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in bulk, and the dominant CD69<sup>+</sup> T<sub>RM</sub> subset. With richer phenotyping of tissue-localised cells, we could in principle use the labelling trajectories to further dissect these differentiation pathways, in the same way that we saw evidence that CD69<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> T<sub>RM</sub> in skin may be fed from a local CD69<sup>−</sup> precursor. One issue is that accurate measurement of label frequencies becomes more difficult as one resolves T<sub>RM</sub> into finer-grained populations, and indeed we saw that label kinetics within the small CD69<sup>−</sup> populations were relatively noisy. Another issue is that label kinetics in these reporter mice operate on the timescales of the net loss rate of cell populations – loss balanced by self-renewal. More frequent sampling would be required to resolve more transitory intermediates. Nevertheless, our study shines a light upon the highly dynamic nature of CD4<sup>+</sup> T<sub>RM</sub>, sustained throughout life by both self renewal and continued influx from precursors. The tissue-specific contributions of these processes may contribute to the differential longevity of immunity at different barrier sites.</p>

<p>This paper provides a <bold>compelling</bold> and rigorous quantitative analysis of the turnover and maintenance of CD4+ tissue-resident memory T cell clones, in the skin and the lamina propria. It provides a <bold>fundamental</bold> advance in our understanding of CD4 T cell regulation. Interestingly, in both tissues, maintenance involves an influx from progenitors on the time scale of months. The evidence that is based on fate mapping and mathematical inference is strong, although open questions on the interpretation of the Ki67-based fate mapping remain.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Compelling and clearly described work that combines two elegant cell fate reporter strains with mathematical modelling to describe the kinetics of CD4+ TRM in mice. The aim is to investigate the cell dynamics underlying the maintenance of CD4+TRM.</p>
<p>The main conclusions are that:</p>
<p>
(1) CD4+ TRM are not intrinsically long-lived.</p>
<p>
(2) Even clonal half-lives are short: 1 month for TRM in skin, and even shorter (12 days) for TRM in lamina propria.</p>
<p>
(3) TRM are maintained by self-renewal and circulating precursors.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) Very clearly and succinctly written. Though in some places too succinctly! See suggestions below for areas I think could benefit from more detail.</p>
<p>(2) Powerful combination of mouse strains and modelling to address questions that are hard to answer with other approaches.</p>
<p>(3) The modelling of different modes of recruitment (quiescent, neutral, division linked) is extremely interesting and often neglected (for simpler neutral recruitment).</p>
<p>Weaknesses/scope for improvement:</p>
<p>(1) The authors use the same data set that they later fit for generating their priors. This double use of the same dataset always makes me a bit squeamish as I worry it could lead to an underestimate of errors on the parameters. Could the authors show plots of their priors and posteriors to check that the priors are not overly-influential? Also, how do differences in priors ultimately influence the degree of support a model gets (if at all)? Could differences in priors lead to one model gaining more support than another?</p>
<p>(2) The authors state (line 81) that cells were &quot;identified as tissue-localised by virtue of their protection from short-term in vivo labelling (Methods; Fig. S1B)&quot;. I would like to see more information on this. How short is short term? How long after labelling do cells need to remain unlabelled in order to be designated tissue-localised (presumably label will get to tissue pretty quickly -within hours?). Can the authors provide citations to defend the assumption that all label-negative cells are tissue-localised (no false negatives)? And conversely that no label-positive cells can be found in the tissue (no false positives)? I couldn't actually find the relevant section in the methods and Figure S1B didn't contain this information.</p>
<p>(3) Are the target and precursor populations from the same mice? If so is there any way to reflect the between-individual variation in the precursor population (not captured by the simple empirical fit)? I am thinking particularly of the skin and LP CD4+CD69- populations where the fraction of cells that are mTOM+ (and to a lesser extent YFP+) spans virtually the whole range. Would it be nice to capture this information in downstream predictions if possible?</p>
<p>(4) In Figure 3, estimates of kinetics for cells in LP appear to be more dependent on the input model (quiescent/neutral/division-linked) than the same parameters in the skin. Can the authors explain intuitively why this is the case?</p>
<p>(5) Can the authors include plots of the model fits to data associated with the different strengths of support shown in Figure 4? That is, I would like to know what a difference in the strength of say 0.43 compared with 0.3 looks like in &quot;real terms&quot;. I feel strongly that this is important. Are all the fits fantastic, and some marginally better than others? Are they all dreadful and some are just less dreadful? Or are there meaningful differences?</p>
<p>(6) Figure 4 left me unclear about exactly which combinations of precursors and targets were considered. Figure 3 implies there are 5 precursors but in Figure 4A at most 4 are considered. Also, Figure 4B suggests skin CD69- were considered a target. This doesn't seem to be specified anywhere.</p>

<p>This manuscript addresses a fundamental problem of immunology - the persistence mechanisms of tissue-resident memory T cells (TRMs). It introduces a novel quantitative methodology, combining the in vivo tracing of T-cell cohorts with rigorous mathematical modeling and inference. Interestingly, the authors show that immigration plays a key role in maintaining CD4+ TRM populations in both skin and lamina propria (LP), with LP TRMs being more dependent on immigration than skin TRMs. This is an original and potentially impactful manuscript. However, several aspects were not clear and would benefit from being explained better or worked out in more detail.</p>
<p>(1) The key observations are as follows:</p>
<p>a) When heritably labeling cells due to CD4 expression, CD4+ TRM labeling frequency declines with time. This implies that CD4+ TRMs are ultimately replenished from a source not labeled, hence not expressing CD4. Most likely, this would be DN thymocytes.</p>
<p>b) After labeling by Ki67 expression, labeled CD4+ TRMs also decline - This is what Figure 1B suggests. Hence they would be replaced by a source that was not in the cell cycle at the time of labeling. However, is this really borne out by the experimental data (Figure 2C, middle row)? Please clarify.</p>
<p>(2) For potential source populations (Figure 2D): Please discuss these data critically. For example, CD4+ CD69- cells in skin and LP start with a much lower initial labeling frequency than the respective TRM populations. Could the former then be precursors of the latter? A similar question applies to LN YFP+ cells. Moreover, is the increase in YFP labeling in naïve T cells a result of their production from proliferative thymocytes? How well does the quantitative interpretation of YFP labeling kinetics in a target population work when populations upstream show opposite trends (e.g., naïve T cells increasing in YFP+ frequency but memory cells in effect decreasing, as, at the time of labeling, non-activated = non-proliferative T cells (and hence YFP-) might later become activated and contribute to memory)?</p>
<p>(3) Please add a measure of variation (e.g., suitable credible intervals) to the &quot;best fits&quot; (solid lines in Figure 2).</p>
<p>(4) Could the authors better explain the motivation for basing their model comparisons on the Leave-One-Out (LOO) cross-validation method? Why not use Bayesian evidence instead?</p>
