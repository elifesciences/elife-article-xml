<title>Summary</title><p>The brain regulates food intake in response to internal energy demands and the availability of food. However, can internal energy storage influence the kind of memory that is formed? We show that the duration of starvation determines whether <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> forms appetitive short-term or long-term memory. The internal glycogen storage in the muscles and fat tissue influences how long sucrose is remembered. Insulin-like signaling in octopaminergic reward neurons integrates internal energy storage into memory formation. In turn, octopamine suppresses the formation of long-term memory. Octopamine is not required for short-term memory, since octopamine-deficient mutants form appetitive short-term memory to sucrose and to other nutrients depending on the internal energy status. The reduced positive reinforcing effect of sucrose in the presence of high internal glycogen levels combined with the increased stability of food-related memories due to increased starvation periods might drive increased food intake.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The internal energy status of an animal needs to be adjusted to the energy expenditure of the organism and the availability of external food to ensure survival. Increased storage of energy correlates with increased food intake in the past. Dysregulation of food intake might result in diseases such as obesity and diabetes. Sucrose is a carbohydrate enriched in Western diets, and the breakdown product of sucrose - glucose - can be stored in the organism as glycogen mainly in the liver and muscles. Increased glycogen levels are a hallmark of glycogen storage diseases that are accompanied by defects in the liver, muscles and brain.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Ellingwood and Cheng, 2018</xref>) Similar to vertebrates, the fruit fly <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> uses glucose as a primary energy source and stores glycogen mainly in the muscles—the major site of energy expenditure—and the fat body—the equivalent of the vertebrate liver.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Galikova and Klepsatel, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Wigglesworth, 1949</xref>) As in vertebrates, glycogen levels are also found in the brain.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Yamada et al., 2018</xref>)</p>
<p>The peptide hormone insulin regulates glycose homeostasis at the cellular level.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Saltiel and Kahn, 2001</xref>) Insulin and its <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> counterpart, insulin-like peptides, perform their functions through well-conserved signal transduction cascades.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Chatterjee and Perrimon, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Inoue et al., 2018</xref>) In vertebrates, in addition to its function in fat tissue and muscles, the insulin receptor is broadly expressed in the brain and regulates neuronal plasticity.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Nakai et al., 2022</xref>) For example, in rats, reduced insulin receptor function in the hypothalamus results in loss of long-term potentiation and impaired spatial memory.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Grillo et al., 2015</xref>) In <italic>Drosophila melanogaster,</italic> the insulin receptor substrate Chico is required for the development of mushroom bodies, a brain region required for learning and memory, and loss of Chico results in learning defects.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Naganos et al., 2012</xref>) Disrupting the function of the insulin receptor in the mushroom bodies also results in learning defects, whereas the insulin receptor and Chico are required in the ellipsoid body for protein biosynthesis-dependent long-term memory.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Chambers et al., 2015</xref>) While there is evidence that insulin receptor signaling regulates cellular physiology, it is not clear how the internal energy supply of the animal influences the formation of food-related memories.</p>
<p>In <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, the monoamine octopamine - functionally related to noradrenalin in vertebrates - is involved in the regulation of energy homeostasis. Upon starvation, the glucose and trehalose concentrations in the hemolymph change less in tyramine-β-hydroxylase (<italic>Tbh</italic>) mutants lacking the neurotransmitter octopamine, and in addition, the life span of <italic>Tbh</italic> mutants is extended.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Damrau et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Li et al., 2016</xref>) <italic>Tbh</italic> mutants show an increased threshold to respond to sucrose with the extension of their proboscis when sucrose is offered to their tarsi – a structure that contains gustatory receptor neurons. The reduced response threshold to sucrose correlates with a reduced sucrose intake in <italic>Tbh</italic> mutants.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Li et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Scheiner et al., 2014</xref>) Octopaminergic neurons potentiate the response of sugar-sensing gustatory receptor neurons in satiated flies, suggesting that octopaminergic neurons regulate feeding behavior by changing the sensitivity of taste receptor neurons.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Youn et al., 2018</xref>) The reduced responsiveness to sucrose is also thought to be responsible for defects observed in habituation in <italic>Tbh</italic> mutants.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Scheiner et al., 2014</xref>) In addition to their changes in simple forms of neuronal plasticity, <italic>Tbh</italic> mutants fail to form a positive association with a food reward in a classical olfactory conditioning paradigm. Flies quickly learn to associate an odorant with sucrose, and Tbh mutants do not show this positive association directly after learning.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Schwaerzel et al., 2003</xref>) However, when a longer time after training has elapsed, memory appears.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Das et al., 2014</xref>) The release of octopamine mediates the reinforcing effect of sweet taste in short-term memory and the anesthesia-resistant form of long-term memory.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Burke et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Huetteroth et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Wu et al., 2013</xref>)</p>
<p>To analyze the relationship between energy status, the evaluation of a food reward and the formation of memory and food intake, we used the olfactory associative learning and memory paradigm. Using nutrients as a positive reward allows for investigating how the internal energy status influences the evaluation of the reinforcer and in turn learning and memory. As a step to understand the interconnection between reward evaluation, nutrient intake and the formation of food-related memories, we analyzed the function of octopamine in the regulation of internal energy homeostasis, learning and memory and food intake.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Starvation increases learning and memory performance when using a food-related reward (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Colomb et al., 2009</xref>). However, how the internal energy status is integrated into the evaluation of the reward and the stability of food-related memories and whether there is a correlation between the perceptions of the food reward, food-related memories and food intake are not clear.</p>

<title>The duration of starvation influences the strength and stability of memories</title>
<p>To investigate whether changes in internal energy storage influence food-related memories, we used the olfactory associative learning and memory paradigm using sucrose as a food-related reinforcer.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Schwaerzel et al., 2003</xref>) In the paradigm, flies learn to associate an odorant with sucrose and are later tested on whether they remember the association. Starved flies were exposed for 2 min to an unconditioned odorant, 4-methylcyclohexanol (MCH), followed by a 2 min exposure to a second odorant, 3-octanol (3-OCT), that was paired with the reward of 2 M sucrose. After the training, flies were given a choice between the two odorants (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). Normally, flies have formed a positive association between the reward and the odorant within 2 min after the training. In a reciprocal experiment, the second odorant was rewarded. The learning index presents the average positive association between the reward and both odorants. Before the experiments, flies were tested to determine whether they perceived the odorants, preferred one odorant over other and responded to the reward similarly to ensure that the observed differences in behavior were not due to changes in odorant perception or sucrose sensitivity (Table S1). To alter the internal energy status, flies were starved either for 16 h or for 40 h before the training (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). We used 3- to 5-day-old male flies to minimize differences in body weight and to control for differences in food preferences. We included <italic>T</italic>β<italic>h<sup>nM18</sup></italic>mutants lacking octopamine in the experiments, since they showed defects in energy metabolism and sucrose reward learning.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Li et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Schwaerzel et al., 2003</xref>) Flies that were starved for 16 h formed a positive association between the rewarded odorants and remembered this association for 2 min but not for 6 h. Consistent with previous results, learning and memory performance was significantly improved by prolonged starvation.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Colomb et al., 2009</xref>) In addition, 16 h starved <italic>T</italic>β<italic>h<sup>nM18</sup></italic> mutants did not show 2 min memory but emerged memory 6 h after training.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Das et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Schwaerzel et al., 2003</xref>) In contrast, after 40 h of starvation, <italic>T</italic>β<italic>h<sup>nM18</sup></italic> mutants already remembered the sucrose paired odorant 2 min after training to a similar extent as after 6 h (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). We repeated similar experiments using a lower concentration of 0.15 M sucrose as a reinforcer (Figure S1). Here, prolonged starvation significantly increased learning and memory performance in controls and <italic>T</italic>β<italic>h<sup>nM18</sup></italic> mutants. In contrast to the experiments using 2 M sucrose as a reward, 16 h starved <italic>T</italic>β<italic>h<sup>nM18</sup></italic> mutants form a negative association with 0.15 M sucrose 2 min after training, but when starved for 40 h, form a positive 2 min memory. Starvation and reinforcer strength regulate appetitive memory strength.</p>

<p>Next, we analyzed how starvation influences the stability of memory. Protein synthesis-dependent long-term memory is still labile directly after training and can be blocked by 4°C cold-shock anesthesia directly after training.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Krashes and Waddell, 2008</xref>) After consolidation, long-term memory is cold-shock resistant and insensitive to a cold shock 1 h before the test. In addition, a second form of longer lasting memory exists, which is directly after training cold-shock insensitive (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). To investigate how starvation influences the stability of appetitive memory, we applied cold-shock anesthesia at different time points after training and analyzed the influence on memory formation in control and <italic>T</italic>β<italic>h<sup>nM18</sup></italic>mutant flies (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). As expected 3 h after training, memory was still present in 16 h starved flies and was completely abolished by a cold shock directly after training or shortly before the test. Increased starvation resulted in memory that was sensitive to cold shock directly after training but not shortly before the test. Thus, an extended period of starvation resulted in long-term memory in control flies. In contrast to 16 h starved controls, 16 h starved <italic>T</italic>β<italic>h<sup>nM18</sup></italic> mutants developed long-term memory that was sensitive to cold shock directly after training and cold shock insensitive shortly before the test. Longer periods of starvation resulted in <italic>T</italic>β<italic>h<sup>nM18</sup></italic> mutants in anesthesia-resistant memory. Thus, with increasing length of starvation, memory becomes more stable. Depending on the duration of starvation, animals first form STM memory, then cold-shock-sensitive LTM and later ARM. The <italic>T</italic>β<italic>h<sup>nM18</sup></italic> mutants that were starved for 16 h formed similar memories to the 40 h starved control flies.</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<title>Octopamine is a negative regulator of memory</title>
<p>Starvation induces the formation of protein synthesis-dependent long-term memory.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Krashes and Waddell, 2008</xref>) Thus, it is likely that the emerging memory 6 h after training in <italic>T</italic>β<italic>h<sup>nM18</sup></italic> mutants is long-term memory. To address this, we abolished a mechanism specifically required for long-term memory in <italic>T</italic>β<italic>h<sup>nM18</sup></italic> mutants and analyzed whether this interferes with emerging memory (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). The R15A04-Gal4 driver targets dopaminergic neurons of the PAM cluster specifically required for appetitive long-term memory but not short-term memory.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Yamagata et al., 2015</xref>) Blocking the function of these dopaminergic neurons directly after training using a temperature-sensitive <italic>shibire</italic> transgene (UAS-shi<sup>ts</sup>) and a 30 min long heat pulse of 31°C resulted in loss of memory in <italic>T</italic>β<italic>h<sup>nM18</sup></italic> mutants (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). This is consistent with the fact that emerging memory is long-term memory. Since the <italic>T</italic>β<italic>h<sup>nM18</sup></italic> mutants lack the neurotransmitter octopamine, we next investigated whether octopamine normally suppresses LTM. To address this, we first blocked the function of octopamine receptors in controls directly after the training by feeding the octopamine antagonist epinastin for 1 h and analyzed memory 5 h later (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). If the function of the octopamine receptor is required for long-term memory, longer lasting memory should also appear in control flies that are starved for 16 h prior to the training, which indeed was the case. Consistent with the idea that octopamine is a negative regulator of long-term memory, feeding octopamine to <italic>T</italic>β<italic>h<sup>nM18</sup></italic> mutants directly after training blocked long-term memory (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). To analyze whether octopamine is also able to block STM, we fed octopamine prior to training to control flies (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>). A short pulse of octopamine before the training inhibits the STM. Thus, octopamine is a negative regulator of appetitive dopaminergic neuron-dependent long-term memory and can block STM.</p>

<title>Starvation influences sucrose consumption preference</title>
<p>Starvation reduces internal energy storage. The reduction might result in reevaluation of external food cues and increased food consumption to restore the energy supply. To investigate whether starvation depletes glycogen storage, we measured glycogen levels in whole animals (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). In controls and <italic>T</italic>β<italic>h<sup>nM18</sup></italic> mutants, starvation reduces glycogen levels; however, non-starved <italic>T</italic>β<italic>h<sup>nM18</sup></italic> mutant males started out with significantly higher glycogen levels. After 40 h of starvation, the glycogen levels of <italic>T</italic>β<italic>h<sup>nM18</sup></italic>mutants were still higher than those of controls that were starved for the same amount of time. The reevaluation of external food cues might be reflected in the choice of food. Adult <italic>T</italic>β<italic>h<sup>nM18</sup></italic> mutants have a reduced sucrose intake.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Li et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Scheiner et al., 2014</xref>) To investigate whether starvation influences the reallocation of an external food cue, we starved flies and determined the preference to consume sucrose to protein-enriched food using the capillary feeder assay (CAFE(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Ja et al., 2007</xref>)). After starvation, control flies and <italic>T</italic>β<italic>h<sup>nM18</sup></italic> mutants chose between 5% sucrose and 5% yeast (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). Prolonged starvation resulted in a decreased sucrose preference in controls and <italic>T</italic>β<italic>h<sup>nM18</sup></italic> mutants, but <italic>T</italic>β<italic>h<sup>nM18</sup></italic> mutants started with a lower sucrose preference. Only after 40 h of starvation did <italic>T</italic>β<italic>h<sup>nM18</sup></italic> mutants show a similar preference to control sucrose consumption. To further investigate whether <italic>T</italic>β<italic>h<sup>nM18</sup></italic>mutants have defects in the regulation of internal sucrose homeostasis, we deprived male flies of sucrose- or protein-enriched food by letting them feed on 5% sucrose, 5% yeast or standard food for 3 days and analyzed their food preference after deprivation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>). As controls, we included mated females in our analysis since they have different nutritional requirements due to their mating status.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Ribeiro and Dickson, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Vargas et al., 2010</xref>) Flies fed standard food for 3 days strongly preferred sucrose to protein-enriched food, with <italic>T</italic>β<italic>h<sup>nM18</sup></italic> mutants showing a significant reduction. The yeast-deprived <italic>T</italic>β<italic>h<sup>nM18</sup></italic> mutant showed a significantly reduced preference for sucrose, and sucrose-deprived mutants had sucrose preferences similar to those of controls. In mated females, no differences in food preference between controls and the <italic>T</italic>β<italic>h<sup>nM18</sup></italic> mutant were observed. In summary, the reduced preference to consume sucrose correlated in <italic>T</italic>β<italic>h<sup>nM18</sup></italic> with increased glycogen levels. In addition, <italic>T</italic>β<italic>h<sup>nM18</sup></italic>mutants can sense the reduction in specific internal energy supplies and change their food preferences accordingly.</p>

<p>Since memory performance increases upon reduction of the internal energy supplies due to starvation, we wanted to investigate whether the internal energy supply influences memory performance.

<p>Increasing glycogen levels in the muscles did not change short-term memory in 16 h starved flies, but the reduction in glycogen significantly improved memory strength (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>). Increasing or decreasing glycogen levels in the fat bodies had no effect on memory performance (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>). When the glycogen levels were significantly increased in the muscles and fat bodies, flies showed a reduced memory to odorants paired with sucrose. An increase in memory performance was observed when glycogen levels were significantly reduced in both tissues (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>). Recently, it has been shown that energy metabolism in mushroom bodies is important for the formation of LTM.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Placais et al., 2017</xref>) To analyze the function of the mushroom bodies, the expression of <italic>GlyS<sup>HMS01279</sup>-RNAi</italic> under the control of the Mef2-Gal4 driver was repressed in the mushroom bodies using the mb247-Gal80 driver.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Krashes et al., 2007</xref>) The memory was still increased (Figure S3).

<p>The elevated glycogen levels in <italic>T</italic>β<italic>h<sup>nM18</sup></italic> mutants might be responsible for the reduced STM. To determine whether the reduction in glycogen levels in the muscles or fat bodies restores STM, we expressed <italic>GlyS<sup>HMS01279</sup>-RNAi</italic> under the control of the <italic>mef2</italic>-Gal4 or <italic>FB</italic>-Gal4 driver in <italic>T</italic>β<italic>h<sup>nM18</sup></italic> mutants and analyzed STM (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>).

<p>To further analyze the influence of the internal energy status on memory performance, we took advantage of the observation that female flies have different nutritional requirements depending on their mating status.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Ribeiro and Dickson, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Vargas et al., 2010</xref>) Virgin females showed a higher consumption preference for sucrose than mated females when given the choice between yeast and sucrose (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>), supporting a difference in internal energy demands and suggesting a difference in valence for different diets. We tested virgin and mated female flies of controls and <italic>T</italic>β<italic>h<sup>nM18</sup></italic> mutants for STM (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>).

<title>Insulin-like signaling in octopaminergic neurons regulates STM</title>
<p>How is the internal energy status integrated into the reward system? Insulin-like signaling regulates glycogen levels in invertebrates and vertebrates.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Semaniuk et al., 2021</xref>) Loss of the insulin receptor results in more circulating sugar but not increased glycogen levels.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Shingleton et al., 2005</xref>) Thus, the insulin receptor might be a good candidate that links the internal energy level to reinforcing neurons. First, we analyzed whether the insulin receptor is expressed in octopaminergic reward neurons in the brain (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>). To detect the expression of an activated insulin receptor, we used an insulin antibody that recognizes the phosphorylated form of the insulin receptor (InR). This region is highly conserved between humans and flies. First, we tested whether the antibody indeed recognizes the activated insulin receptor. Therefore, we overexpressed the activated insulin receptor using the UAS-InR.A1325D transgene under the control of the <italic>dTdc2</italic>-Gal4 driver (Figure S5). The InR.A1325D protein variant mimics the human V938D protein variant that is constitutively active,(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Longo et al., 1992</xref>) and the <italic>dTdc2</italic>-Gal4 driver targets octopaminergic reward neurons.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Busch et al., 2009</xref>) The expression of activated InR resulted in increased immune reactivity (Figure S5). Thus, the InR antibody detects the activated InR. In the brain, activated InR is broadly expressed in a punctate manner and more specifically in the soma of <italic>dTdc2</italic>-Gal4-targeted neurons (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>). To uncouple energy sensing via the insulin receptor in reward neurons, we expressed UAS-InR.K1409A under the control of the <italic>dTdc2</italic>-Gal4 driver.

<title>Increased starvation results in overconsumption in T<bold><italic>β</italic></bold>h<sup>nM18</sup> mutants</title>
<p>To analyze whether the increased glycogen levels and the reduced sucrose reward correlate with food consumption, the energy demands in flies under different starvation conditions were analyzed by measuring food intake (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>). When control flies were starved for 16 h or 40 h, they consumed similar amounts of 5% sucrose. In contrast, 16 h-starved <italic>T</italic>β<italic>h<sup>nM18</sup></italic> mutants consumed significantly less sucrose, but after 40 h of starvation, they consumed approximately 34% more sucrose (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7B</xref>).

<p>Depending on the internal energy level, flies form first protein-dependent aversive olfactory LTM and later ARM, a protein synthesis-independent form of memory.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Wu et al., 2005</xref>) In times of energy shortage, for the organism, costly protein biosynthesis-dependent LTM is exchanged against “less costly” protein biosynthesis-independent ARM.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Mery and Kawecki, 2005</xref>) Similarly, we observed that after shorter periods of starvation, appetitive LTM appeared, whereas after longer periods of starvation, ARM emerged (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>). The <italic>T</italic>β<italic>h<sup>nM18</sup></italic>mutants form only anesthesia-sensitive aversive memory.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Wu et al., 2013</xref>) In contrast, depending on the duration of starvation, the emerging appetitive memory in <italic>T</italic>β<italic>h<sup>nM18</sup></italic>mutants is cold-shock sensitive or cold-shock insensitive. Thus, Tβh<sup>nM18</sup> mutants are not defective in appetitive ARM, and the internal energy status defines how quickly ARM is formed.</p>

<title>Octopamine gates memory formation</title>
<p>What is the function of octopamine in memory formation? Octopamine is a negative regulator of emerging LTM, as feeding octopamine receptor antagonists to control flies results in memory, and emerging memory in <italic>T</italic>β<italic>h<sup>nM18</sup></italic>mutants is suppressed by octopamine after conditioning. In addition, octopamine acts upstream of dopaminergic neurons in the formation of LTM, since blocking neurotransmitter release of dopaminergic LTM-mediating neurons directly after conditioning blocks memory formation in <italic>T</italic>β<italic>h<sup>nM18</sup></italic> mutants. The results are consistent with the model that dopamine release is not required during the pairing of the conditioned stimulus and the reward rather than as gain control after the training.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Adel and Griffith, 2021</xref>) The gain can be controlled by the inhibitory function of octopamine.</p>
<p>Similar to the function of octopamine upstream of dopaminergic neurons in LTM, octopamine acts upstream of dopaminergic neurons during the acquisition of appetitive STM.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Burke et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Liu et al., 2012</xref>) However, at first glance, the function of octopamine seems to differ in STM and LTM. Loss of octopamine in <italic>T</italic>β<italic>h<sup>nM18</sup></italic>mutants results in loss of STM, supporting that octopamine is required as a positive regulator for appetitive STM.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Schwaerzel et al., 2003</xref>) The loss of STM in <italic>T</italic>β<italic>h<sup>nM18</sup></italic> mutants has been attributed to the loss of labile STM that forms in response to the sweetness of sucrose but not due to defects in stable LTM that forms in response to the caloric value of sugar.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Burke et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Fujita and Tanimura, 2011</xref>) Sweetness is sensed by gustatory receptor neurons that change their sensitivity upon starvation(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Inagaki et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Marella et al., 2012</xref>) and thereby influence responsiveness to the external reinforcer. Responsiveness might be regulated by the octopaminergic system, since octopaminergic neurons regulate the sucrose sensitivity of gustatory neurons in <italic>Drosophila</italic>.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Youn et al., 2018</xref>) However, the reduced sensitivity of gustatory sucrose receptors cannot explain why octopamine-deficient mutants do not form STM, since <italic>T</italic>β<italic>h<sup>nM18</sup></italic> mutants form aversive memory to lower sucrose concentrations.</p>
<p>The internal energy status influences how the external source of sucrose is evaluated rather than octopamine being directly involved in the acquisition of appetitive STM. Consistently, <italic>T</italic>β<italic>h<sup>nM18</sup></italic> is able to show similar levels of STM as controls after longer periods of starvation. This is further strengthened by the results showing that octopaminergic reward neurons that are uncoupled from energy sensing by inactivation of insulin receptor signaling and reduced glycogen levels in <italic>T</italic>β<italic>h<sup>nM18</sup></italic> flies also improve appetitive STM. In addition, <italic>T</italic>β<italic>h<sup>nM18</sup></italic>mutant females with different energy requirements form appetitive STM, and a short pulse of octopamine before conditioning can even block STM. Thus, octopamine is not required in the acquisition of appetitive STM but rather suppresses LTM when enough energy is available. In addition, the function of OA as a suppressor of different forms of memory allows for differential selection of what kind of memory is formed depending on internal and external information. This gating function in memory formation by octopamine can also be observed in other behaviors. For example, octopamine regulates the decision to approach or avert a food source.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Classen and Scholz, 2018</xref>) Thus, the octopaminergic system integrates internal energy demands and the evaluation of external information.</p>

<title>The internal energy level of the animal influences memory formation</title>
<p>On the cellular level, insulin receptor signaling regulates energy metabolism.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Chatterjee and Perrimon, 2021</xref>) The broad expression pattern of the insulin receptor in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> brain (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>) indicates that every cell in the brain needs to regulate its own energy homeostasis. However, the overall energy resources of the fly and the evaluation of the external food supply also need to be integrated into memory formation. The external food supply might be evaluated by the reward system. In mice, insulin receptor signaling in dopaminergic neurons mediates food reward.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Konner et al., 2011</xref>) Consistently, insulin receptor signaling in octopaminergic reward neurons regulates the rewarding properties of sucrose in appetitive STM memory (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>) and food intake (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>).</p>
<p>The systemic metabolic rate is regulated by fat bodies. For example, after food intake, the fat body secretes Unpaired 2 (Upd2), which in turn regulates the secretion of Dilps via GABergic neurons.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Rajan and Perrimon, 2012</xref>) Reduction of glycogen in the fat bodies is not sufficient to change appetitive STM, but reduction in the muscles or both tissues is. The results support a feedback mechanism between the evaluation of glycogen levels in the muscles and the brain. In addition, the muscles and the fat bodies communicate about the energy content of both structures, and this information is signaled back to the brain. Such long-range signals from muscles exist. Skeletal muscles are secretory organs.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Pedersen and Febbraio, 2012</xref>) For example, the muscle-secreted Amyrel amylase reduces the age-related accumulation of polyubiquitinated proteins in the brain.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Rai et al., 2021</xref>) Independent of how the glycogen levels of both tissues are communicated to the brain, they influence how the reinforcer is evaluated in learning and memory processing. Feedback between the energy levels in both structures is still intact in octopamine-deficient mutants, since Tβh<sup>nM18</sup> mutants still form STM when the energy storage is sufficiently reduced.</p>

<title>Are food-related memories and internal glycogen levels predictive of food intake?</title>
<p>Feeding behaviors in hungry animals are regulated by different neural systems, including networks receiving and processing sensory information and networks assigning reward properties to food.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Berridge, 2009</xref>) Blocking insulin receptor function in dopaminergic neurons causes increased food intake and weight gain in mice.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Konner et al., 2011</xref>) Similarly, blocking insulin receptor function in octopaminergic reward neurons in flies with increased glycogen levels and reduced food intake increases food intake. Thus, the octopaminergic system assigns reward properties to food. However, blocking insulin receptor signaling on reward neurons does not result in extensive overconsumption, supporting that the regulation of the food amount is still intact and is not due to insulin receptor resistance in reward neurons. Increased levels of internal energy, e.g., glycogen, reduced the reward properties of food, resulting in a decreased positive association of food-related memories and decreased food consumption. This should prevent increased food intake in the presence of excess food. Insulin resistance might contribute to weight gain, since in addition to high levels of glycogen, the flies show normal food intake. However, weight gain might be differentially regulated by overeating. The overconsumption is only visible after a prolonged phase of starvation that is also correlated with emerging stable appetitive long-term memory. This suggests that the stability of appetitive memory might result in the re-evaluation of food and might trigger the overconsumption of food.</p>
<p>In summary, the octopaminergic neurotransmitter system integrates several aspects that influence the regulation of food memories. Octopamine modules the sensory perception of the conditioned stimulus and the sensory perception of the reward. Here, we show that the evaluation of food reward in the context of energy storage is integrated by the octopaminergic system and influences the stability of food-related memories. The function of octopamine as a negative regulator of different forms of memory allows for selective regulation of associated behaviors such as food intake, and the loss of this regulation might also promote dysregulation of food intake. The close relationship between the octopaminergic neurotransmitter and the noradrenergic neurotransmitter system suggests that integrator function might be conserved.</p>

<title>Olfactory learning and memory</title>
<p>Associative olfactory learning and memory was trained and tested with a modified version of the Tully and Quinn olfactory conditioning apparatus.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Schwaerzel et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Tully and Quinn, 1985</xref>) Approximately 70 one- to two-day-old male flies were collected with CO<sub>2</sub> anesthesia and were kept for 2 days at 25°C to recover from CO<sub>2</sub> sedation. Briefly, three- to five-day-old male flies were starved for 16 h or 40 h in vials with water-soaked filter paper at the bottom. Flies were transferred to training tubes and exposed to the first odorant for 2 min, either 3-octanol (3-OCT diluted 1:80 in paraffin oil) or 4-methylcyclohexanol (MCH diluted 1:100 in paraffin oil). After that, they were transferred to a second tube and exposed to the second odorant in the presence of filter paper soaked with either 0.15 M sucrose, 2 M sucrose or 5% yeast. To analyze the abilities of the flies to learn and remember the odorant paired with the reward, 2 min, 3 h or 6 h after training, flies were given the choice between odorant 1 (CS+) and odorant 2 (CS-) for 2 min. The performance index (PI) was calculated as PI = (# (CS+) + # (CS-)/(total # flies), where CS+ indicates the odorant associated with the appetitive reinforcer and CS-indicates the odorant that was not associated with the reinforcer. To exclude nonassociative effects, each “n” consists of a reciprocally trained, independent group of naïve flies. For pharmacological experiments, flies were fed water, 3 mM OA or 2 M sucrose before training or with 3 mM OA or 3 mM Epinastine between training and testing. The assay was performed at RT with 60% relative humidity. For cold-shock experiments, flies in vials were placed in ice-cold water for 2 min. Odorant acuity and odorant balance were tested with naïve flies placed into the Tully Quinn setup. They chose for 2 min between odorant- or paraffin oil-containing sides or between both odorants. For sucrose and yeast preference, flies chose between sucrose- or yeast-soaked filter paper and water-soaked filter paper.</p>

<title>Food intake</title>
<p>To analyze the consumption of nutrients in flies, the capillary feeder (CaFe) assay was performed.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Diegelmann et al., 2017</xref>) Briefly, eight three- to five-day-old male or female flies that were either nonstarved or starved for 18 h or 40 h had access to 4 capillaries filled with either 5% sucrose or 5% yeast or a mixture of both for 24 h at 25°C and 60% humidity. The solution was colored with red food dye. During starvation, flies were kept in vials with wet filter paper at 25°C and 60% humidity. The amount of consumed solution was determined using an electronic caliper. To account for evaporation, the average evaporation of three CAFE setups without flies was measured and used to normalize the average food intake per fly. To normalize food intake to body weight, at least 5 times 100 male flies per genotype and condition were weighed, and the average body weight of a single fly was determined. The total consumption per µg fly was calculated by dividing the total consumption per fly by the mean weight of a fly. N indicates the number of tested groups.</p>

<title>Glycogen content</title>
<p>Whole body glycogen levels were determined with the Glucose (HK) Assay Kit (Sigma Aldrich, #GAHK20-1KT) according to the protocol of.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Tennessen et al., 2014</xref>) A group of five male flies that were either sated or starved for 16 h or 40 h were homogenized in 100 µl ice-cold 1x PBS. To reduce enzymatic degradation, proteins and enzymes were heat inactivated at 70°C for 10 min. The supernatant was removed and diluted 1:3 with 1x PBS. Twenty microliters of the samples were either added to 20 µl of 1x PBS or PBS/Amyloglucosidase mix and incubated at 37°C for 60 min. Then, 100 µl of HK-reagent was added to the sample or glucose standard and incubated for 15 min at RT. Absorbance was measured at 340 nm. The glycogen content was calculated by subtracting the total glucose concentration from 1x PBS-treated samples from the total glucose of amyloglucosidase-treated samples.</p>

<title>Periodic acid staining</title>
<p>To visualize glycogen levels in the fat bodies and muscle tissue of larvae and adult <italic>Drosophila</italic>, PAS staining was performed after Yamada et al.,(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Yamada et al., 2018</xref>) with a slight modification. The samples were fixed in 3.5% formaldehyde for 20 min and washed two times for 5 min with 1% BSA/PBS. Periodic acid solution was added for 5 min, followed by two washes of 5 min with 1% BSA/PBS. Schiff’s Reagent was added for 5 min, followed by two washes of 5 min with 1% BSA/PBS. Tissue was stored in 50% glycerol.</p>

<title>Immunohistochemistry</title>
<p>For immunohistochemistry, antibodies raised in rabbits against the activated insulin-like receptor (cell signaling technology #3021) were used at a dilution of 1:50 in 5% normal goat serum in PBS with 0.1% Triton and incubated for two days. The brains were washed with PBS with 0.3% Triton.</p>

<title>Quantification and statistical analysis</title>
<p>Food intake was displayed as the mean ± s.e.m. For learning and memory experiments, the data were displayed as boxplot ± minimum (Q1–1.5*IQR) and maximum (Q1 + 1.5*IQR). The nonparametric one-sample sign test and the parametric one-sample t test were used to analyze whether behavior was based on random choice. Differences between two groups were determined with Student’s t test, and more groups were compared with one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s post hoc HSD test. Statistical analysis was performed with Statistica 9.1 (StatSoft, Tulsa, OK, USA). Boxplots were generated with Microsoft Excel 2016 and GIMP 2.10.12.</p>

<p>This <bold>important</bold> study dissects the interplay between internal energy homeostasis, food intake and food-related memories, focusing on the role played in Drosophila by Octopamine, a monoamine functionally related to noradrenalin. This work will help interpret previously published work on the function of Octopamine, and should be of interest to the growing community of biologists interested in how internal state shapes behavior, including decision making processes, learning and memory. The experimental evidence is <bold>solid</bold>, but additional evidence using, for instance, tissue-specific and effector-specific manipulation, and a unifying model would strengthen the present study.</p>

<p>The present study by Berger et al. analyzes to what extent memory formation is dependent on available energy reserves. This has been dealt with extensively in the case of aversive memory formation, but only very sparsely in the case of appetitive memory formation. It has long been known that an appetitive memory in flies can only be formed by starvation. However, the authors here additionally show that not only the duration of starvation plays a role, but also determines which form of memory (short- or long-term memory) is formed. The authors demonstrated that internal glycogen stores play a role in this process and that this is achieved through insulin-like signaling in octopaminergic reward neurons that integrates internal energy stores into memory formation. Here, the authors suggest that octopamine plays a role as a negative regulator of different forms of memory.</p>
<p>The study sheds light on an old question, to what extent the octopaminergic neuronal system plays a role in the formation of appetitive memory, since in recent years only the dopaminergic system has been in focus. Furthermore, the data are an interesting contribution to the ongoing debate whether insulin receptors play a role in neurons themselves or in glial cells. The experiments are very well designed and the authors used a variety of behavioural experiments, genetic tools to manipulate neuronal activity and state-of-the-art imaging techniques. In addition, they not only clearly demonstrated that octopamine is a negative regulator of appetitive memory formation, but also proposed a mechanism by which the insulin receptor in octopaminergic neurons senses the internal energy status and then controls the activity of those neurons. The conclusions are mostly supported by the data, but some aspects related to the experimental design, some explanations and literature references need more clarification and revision.</p>
<p>1. Usually, long-term memory (LTM) is tested 24 hours after training. Here, the authors usually refer to LTM as a memory that is tested 6 hours after training. The addition of a control experiment to show that LTM that the authors observe here lasts longer would increase the power of this study immensely.</p>
<p>2. The authors define here another consolidated memory component as ARM, when they applied a cold-shock 2 hours after training. However, some publications showed that LTM is formed after only one training cycle (Krashes et al 2008, Tempel et al 1983). This makes it difficult to determine, whether appetitive ARM can be formed. Furthermore, one study showed that appetitive ARM is absent after massed training (Colomb et al 2009). Therefore, the conclusion could be also, that different starvation protocols, would lead to different stabilities of LTM. Therefore, additional experiments could help to clarify this opposing explanation. From these results, it can then be concluded either that different stable forms of LTM are formed depending on the starvation state, or that two differently consolidated memory phases (LTM, ARM) are formed, as has already been shown for aversive memory. This is also important for other statements in the manuscript, and therefore the authors should address this. For example, the findings about the insulin receptor (is it two opposing memories or different stabilities of LTM).</p>

<p>How organism physiological state modulates establishment and perdurance of memories is a timely question that the authors aimed at addressing by studying the interplay between energy homeostasis and food-related conditioning in Drosophila. Specifically, they studied how starvation modulates the establishment of short-term vs long-term memories and clarified the role of the monoamine Octopamine in food-related conditioning, showing that it is not per se involved in formation of appetitive short-term memories but rather gates memory formation by suppressing LTM when energy levels are high. This work clarifies previously described phenotypes and provides insight about interconnections between energy levels, feeding and formation of short-term and long-term food-related memories. In the absence of population-specific manipulation of octopamine signaling, it however does not reach a circuit-level understanding of how these different processes are integrated.</p>
<p>Strengths</p>
<p>
- Previous studies have documented the impact of Octopamine on different aspects of food-related behaviors (regulation of energy homeostasis, feeding, sugar sensing, appetitive memory...), but we currently lack a clear understanding of how these different functions are interconnected. The authors have used a variety of experimental approaches to systematically test the impact of internal energy levels in establishment of appetitive memory and the role of Octopamine in this process.</p>
<p>- The authors have used a range of approaches, performed carefully controlled experiments and produced high quality data.</p>
<p>Weaknesses</p>
<p>
1- In the tbh mutant flies, Tyramine -to- Octopamine conversion is inhibited, resulting not only in a lack of Octopamine, but also in elevated levels of Tyramine. If and how elevated levels of Tyramine contributes to the described phenotypes is unclear. In the current version of the manuscript, only one set of experiments (Figure 2) has been performed using Octopamine agonist. This is particularly important in light of recent published data showing that starvation modifies Tyramine levels.</p>
<p>2- Octopamine (and its precursor Tyramine) have been implicated in numerous processes, complicating the analysis of the phenotypes resulting from a general inhibition of tbh.</p>
<p>3- The manuscript explores various aspects of the impact of energy levels on food-related behaviors and the underlying sensing and effector mechanism, both in wild-type and tbh mutants, making it difficult to follow the flow of the results.</p>

<p>In this manuscript, Berger et al. study how internal energy storage influence learning and memory. Since in Drosophila melanogaster, octopamine (OA) is involved in the regulation of energy homeostasis they focus on the roles of OA. To do so they use the tyramine-β-hydroxylase (Tbh) mutant that is lacking the neurotransmitter OA and study short term memory (STM), long-term memory (LTM) and anesthesia-resistant memory (ARM). They show that the duration of starvation affects the magnitude of both short- and long-term memory. In addition, they show that OA has a suppressive effect on learning and memory. In terms of energy storage, they show that internal glycogen storage influences how long sucrose is remembered and high glycogen suppresses memory. Finally, they show that insulin-like signaling in octopaminergic neurons, which is also related to internal energy storage, suppresses learning and memory.</p>
<p>This is an important study that extends our knowledge on OA activity in learning and memory and the effects the metabolic state has on learning and memory. The authors nicely use the genetic tools available in flies to try and unravel the complex circuitry of metabolic state level, OA activity and learning and memory.</p>
<p>
Nevertheless, I do have some comments that I think require attention:</p>
<p>1. The authors use RNAi to reduce the level of glycogen synthase or glycogen phosphorylase. These manipulations are expected to affect the level of glycogen. Using specific drivers the authors attempt to manipulate glycogen level at the muscles and fat bodies and examine how this affects learning and memory. The conclusions of the authors arise solely from the manipulation intended (i.e. the genetics). However, the authors also directly measured glycogen levels at these organs and those do not follow the manipulation intended, i.e. the RNAi had very limited effect on the glycogen level. Nevertheless, these results are ignored.</p>
<p>2. The authors claim in the summary that OA is not required for STM. However, according to one experiment OA is required for STM as Tbh mutants cannot form STM. In another experiment OA is suppressive to STM as wt flies fed with OA cannot form STM. Therefore, it is very difficult to appreciate the actual role of OA on STM.</p>
<p>3. The authors use t-test and ANOVA for most of the statistics, however, they did not perform normality tests. While I am quite sure that most datasets will pass normality test, nevertheless, this is required.</p>
<p>4. While it is logical to assume that OA neurons are upstream to R15A04 DA neurons, I am not sure this really arises from the experiment that is presented here. It is well established that without activity in R15A04 DA neurons there is no LTM. Since OA acts to decrease LTM, can one really conclude anything about the location of OA effect when there is no learning?</p>
<p>5. It is unclear how expression of a dominant negative form of insulin receptor (InR) in OA neurons can rescue the lack of OA due to the Tbh mutation. If OA neurons cannot release anything to the presumably downstream DA neurons, how can changing their internal signaling has any effect?</p>
<p>While I stressed some comments that need to be addressed, the overall take-home message of the manuscript is supported and the authors do show that the metabolic state of the animal affects learning and memory. I do think though, that some more caution is required for some of the conclusions.</p>
