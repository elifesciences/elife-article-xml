<title>Abstract</title>
<p>For drugs to be active they have to reach their targets. Within cells this requires free diffusion, distribution, and availability. Here, we explored the intracellular diffusion rates and distribution of a series of small molecular fluorescent drugs, in comparison to proteins, by microscopy and fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP). While all proteins diffused freely, we found a strong correlation between p<italic>K</italic><sub>a</sub> and the intracellular diffusion and distribution of small molecule drugs. Weakly basic, small-molecule drugs displayed lower fractional recovery after photobleaching and 10-to-20-fold slower diffusion rates in cells than in aqueous solutions. As, more than half of pharmaceutical drugs are weakly basic, they, are protonated at pH 7.4, resulting in their sequestration in the cell cytoplasm. Protonation, facilitates the formation of membrane impermeable ionic form of the weak base small molecules. This results in ion trapping, further reducing diffusion rates of weakly basic small molecule drugs under macromolecular crowding conditions where other nonspecific interactions become more relevant and dominant. Our imaging studies showed that acidic organelles, particularly the lysosome, captured these molecules. Surprisingly, blocking lysosomal import only slightly increased diffusion rates and fractional recovery. Conversely, blocking protonation by <italic>N-</italic>acetylated analogues, greatly enhanced their diffusion and fractional recovery after FRAP. Based on these results, <italic>N</italic>-acetylation of small molecule drugs may improve the intracellular availability and distribution of weakly basic, small molecule drugs.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Drug molecules alter many biochemical reaction pathways inside the cell by interacting with proteins, DNAs, RNAs, or others. By this, they influence one or more specific cellular activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Ong et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Schreiber, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Stockwell, 2004</xref>). Due to their bioactivity, stability, rather simple chemical synthesis allowing for industrial bulk scale production and the easiness of administration, most drugs are small molecules (&lt; 1 kDa) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Ngo and Garneau-Tsodikova, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Veber et al., 2002</xref>). Over half of these drugs have a significant degree of hydrophobicity and are weakly basic at intracellular pH of 7.4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Charifson and Walters, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Lipinski et al., 1997</xref>). Hydrophobicity is required to cross the lipid bilayer of the cell membranes, and polar functional groups solubilize the drug in the cellular medium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Lipinski et al., 1997</xref>). The balance between p<italic>K</italic><sub>a</sub> and logP (partition coefficient of small molecules as measured from their partition between octanol/water) is critical for successful drug design (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Manallack, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Meanwell, 2011</xref>). Lipinski’s “Rules of 5” suggests that logP should be between 1 and 6 to be a candidate for successful oral administration. Small molecule drugs can be acidic or basic depending on their p<italic>K</italic><sub>a</sub> values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Lipinski et al., 1997</xref>). Drugs with p<italic>K</italic><sub>a</sub> ∼ 0-7 are considered acidic, and p<italic>K</italic><sub>a</sub> ∼ 8-14 are regarded as basic or alkaline. Basic drugs with p<italic>K</italic>a ˃8 are more common than their acidic counterparts (p<italic>K</italic>a ˂ 7, ∼60:40 ratios). In some cases, lowering their p<italic>K</italic><sub>a</sub> to the range between 6 and 7, has proven beneficial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Charifson and Walters, 2014</xref>). For a long time, mechanisms such as passive diffusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Di et al., 2012</xref>) and carrier-mediated drug delivery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Dobson and Kell, 2008</xref>) or a combination of both (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Sugano et al., 2010</xref>) have been used to explain intracellular drug delivery. However, transport of a drug across the cellular membrane is only one part of a successful delivery. Intracellular diffusion and bio-distribution needs to be taken in account when assessing the drug mode of action.</p>
<p>In previous work, we studied the diffusion of fluorescent drug molecules in crowded environments <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Dey et al., 2022</xref>). However, the cellular cytoplasm of eukaryotic cells is by far more complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Model et al., 2021</xref>). Intracellular membranes, multiple organelles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Ellis, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Fulton, 1982</xref>) and a large diversity of macromolecules, in terms of size, charge and hydrophobicity, render the cellular interior extremely complex and heterogeneous (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Milo and Phillips, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Neurohr and Amon, 2020</xref>). Moreover, the pH inside cellular organelles can vastly differ from the cytosolic pH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Madshus, 1988</xref>). Organelles like lysosomes, late endosomes, Golgi, and secretory vesicles are acidic and have been known for sequestering weakly basic drugs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Asokan and Cho, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Proksch, 2018</xref>). Therefore, predicting diffusion of a particular drug molecule in the dense cytoplasm is a complex task and requires sub-organelle resolution. For example, positively charged (basic) drugs designed to target nuclear DNA may bind cytoplasmic matter through nonspecific interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Long et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Tiwari et al., 2018</xref>), they could be sequestrated within the lysosome, or diffuse slower than expected due to crowding and nonspecific interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Gotink et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Jansen et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Zhitomirsky and Assaraf, 2015</xref>).</p>
<p>The mobility of a drug in the cellular interior has been shown to be a good proxy for intracellular drug delivery and other processes, such as nonspecific binding or aggregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Dey et al., 2022</xref>). The primary tool for measuring small molecule diffusion inside the cell is fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP), which inherently requires fluorescent drug molecules. FRAP with a confocal microscope is a sufficiently sensitive, versatile, and easy-to-use method suitable for measuring the diffusion of weakly fluorescent molecules. Unfortunately, single-molecule fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS), a gold-standard method for measuring diffusion of fluorescent particles, cannot be applied for most small molecule drugs due to their weak fluorescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Dey et al., 2022</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">2021</xref>; Zotter et al., 2017).</p>
<p>In this work, we determined the intracellular diffusion coefficients of a series of fluorescent dyes and drugs compared to protein diffusion by FRAP (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref> and <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Specifically, we used Line-FRAP, which has a much higher time resolution and therefore can measure faster diffusion rates in comparison to standard FRAP (800 Hz versus 50 Hz, for detailed explanations, see (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Dey et al., 2022</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Dey et al., 2021</xref>)). The apparent diffusion coefficients derived from FRAP measurements are termed D<sub>confocal</sub> (<xref rid="eqn1" ref-type="disp-formula">Equation 1</xref>, materials and method sections). Importantly, D<sub>confocal</sub> values for proteins determined by Line-FRAP agreed with the diffusion rates measured by FCS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Dey et al., 2021</xref>). For small molecules, Line-FRAP only provides relative 3D diffusion coefficients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Dey et al., 2022</xref>). We studied the following fluorescent drugs: the antimalarial drugs quinacrine dihydrochloride (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Ehsanian et al., 2011</xref>), primaquine phosphate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Camarda et al., 2019</xref>) and amidoquine (Olliaro and Mussano, 2009). The anti-cancer drug mitoxantrone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Shenkenberg and Von Hoff, 1986</xref>), and the glycogen synthase kinase GSK3 inhibitor SB216763 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Wagman et al., 2005</xref>). In addition, we monitored the diffusion of the diagnostic staining agent fluorescein disodium salt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Jampol and Cunha-Vaz, 1984</xref>), the fluorogenic substrate CCF2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Zuverink and Barbieri, 2015</xref>) and boron dipyrromethene (BODIPY) analogues, which are used as fluorescent markers for lipids, membranes, and other lipophilic compounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Poryvai et al., 2022</xref>).</p>

<p>The diffusion coefficients and their cellular distributions showed very slow diffusion of the basic compounds, i.e., low FRAP recovery, combined with an accumulation of the molecules in lysosomes. Surprisingly, while inhibiting the V-ATPase H<sup>+</sup> pump using Bafilomycin A1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Spugnini et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Wang et al., 2021</xref>) or sodium azide (Hiruma et al., 2007) inhibited accumulation in lysosomes, cellular diffusion and fractional recovery increased only slightly. Contrary, blocking protonatable amino groups by acetylation greatly enhanced diffusion and FRAP recovery of studied small molecules. As over half the small molecule drugs are basic, our findings are highly important in future drug development, as slow diffusion and low FRAP recovery is directly related to reduced cellular activity. Contrary to small molecules, we show here that diffusion rates within the cytoplasm of HeLa cells of 16 different <italic>E.coli</italic> proteins with p<italic>K</italic>a values of 4.5-8, are within the expected range, suggesting that hindered diffusion is mainly a problem of small molecules.</p>

<title>Acidic Proteins diffuse freely in the HeLa cytoplasm</title>
<p>We have previously shown that diffusion in the cellular cytoplasm of E-fts and baeR, two bacterial globular proteins, aligns with the expected values considering the ∼2-3-fold higher macro-viscosity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Dey et al., 2021</xref>). Here, we extended this study to include 16 additional proteins (mostly from <italic>E. coli</italic>) whose oligomeric states in solution were previously characterized (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbls1">Table S1</xref> and (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Marciano et al., 2022</xref>)). The idea was to see and compare how a considerable population of proteins, heterologous to the cell (HeLa) diffuse inside the living cell. The proteins showed D<sub>confocal</sub> values of 18-30 µm<sup>2</sup>s<sup>-1</sup> in HeLa cell cytoplasm, which is typical for a cytoplasmic protein diffusion coefficient (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). Moreover, a complete FRAP recovery was observed, indicating free diffusion. <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbls1">Table S1</xref> provides the predicted isoelectric points and net charges at pH 7.4 of the purified proteins as calculated by Prot Pi, showing p<italic>K</italic>a values of 4.5-8, as are the majority of <italic>E.coli</italic> cytosolic proteins. The results show that acidic and neutral proteins, even if not in their native environment (<italic>E.coli</italic> proteins in HeLa cells), do not stick to the HeLa cell cytoplasm. Next, we studied diffusion of small molecule drugs in HeLa cells.</p>

<title>Negatively charged small molecules rapidly diffuse in live cells</title>
<p>Fluorescein is a negatively charged small organic molecule (p<italic>K</italic><sub>a</sub>’s = 2.85, 3.7, M.W. = 332 Da, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref> and <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). We showed in previous work that fluorescein diffusion is slower in the presence of crowder proteins like BSA, lysozyme and, myoglobin, even at relatively low protein concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Dey et al., 2022</xref>). Here, the Fluorescein dye was micro-injected in live HeLa cells, followed by FRAP measurements. For comparison, we also incubated HeLa cells for 24 hrs with fluorescein, which is a sufficient time for fluorescein to accumulate in the cells by diffusion. We found that the diffusion coefficient of fluorescein in PBS (D<sub>confocal</sub> of 56.5±2.4 µm<sup>2</sup>s<sup>-1</sup>) was reduced to D<sub>confocal</sub> of 38.5±2.0 µm<sup>2</sup>s<sup>-1</sup> in HeLa cytoplasm (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). In the cell nucleus, a value of D<sub>confocal</sub> of 43.2±2.2 µm<sup>2</sup>s<sup>-1</sup> was determined, while in concentrated HeLa cell extract (equivalent protein concentration of ∼100 mg/mL), D<sub>confocal</sub> of 49.6±1.9 µm<sup>2</sup>s<sup>-1</sup> was measured. The faster D<sub>confocal</sub> in cell extract compared to live-cell cytoplasm may result from the higher crowding density of the latter. The lowering of diffusion coefficients of negatively charged fluorescein correlates with the increasing crowding density of the medium moving from simple buffer to cells. While micrographs did not show dye aggregation inside the cell cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Figure S1A-B</xref>) and diffusion rates are the same as determined by microinjection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Figure S1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">S1D</xref>), the fractional recovery dropped from 0.95 to 0.65. This suggests that a fraction of fluorescein is immobile in the cell after 24 h incubation.</p>

<p>CCF2 is a fluorogenic substrate used for monitoring β-lactamase activity, with a p<italic>K</italic>a of ∼5.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Zlokarnik et al., 1998</xref>). It is composed of cephalosporin core linking B7-hydroxycoumarin to fluorescein (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). Its calculated D<sub>confocal</sub> values in PBS and inside cells are about half as fast as those measured for fluorescein (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D-F</xref>), and its fractional recovery is ∼0.7. No sign of aggregation is seen in micrographs inside the cell cytoplasm or nucleus (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref>). The substantial slower rate of recovery, and lower fractional recovery of CCF2 relative to Fluorescein suggests its diffusion to be obstructed within the cell. This is in line with our prediction, that the observed substrate limited enzymatic degradation of CCF2 in HeLa cells is a consequence of its occlusion within the cellular cytoplasm (Zotter et al., 2017).</p>
<p>A third molecule for which we determined the diffusion coefficient is the labelling dye CF514. It is used to label proteins and has high quantum yield. As its structure has not been published, we estimated the p<italic>K</italic><sub>a</sub> value from the pH dependent UV-spectrophotometry measurements. The sharp changes of the UV-spectrum at pH∼3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Figure S1E-F</xref>), as well as the redshift confirms a p<italic>K</italic><sub>a</sub> value of ∼ 3. The FRAP curves look similar to fluorescein (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3G-I</xref>), with ∼90% recovery after FRAP. D<sub>confocal</sub> in PBS was ∼ 61.1±3.0 µm<sup>2</sup>s<sup>-1</sup>, and 26.3±1.9 and 29.2±2.0 µm<sup>2</sup>s<sup>-1</sup> in the cell cytoplasm and nucleus of HeLa cells, respectively (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3H</xref>). The drop of D<sub>confocal</sub> is attributed to cellular crowding. The results so far show that acidic small molecules diffuse well inside cells. Next, we focus on basic small molecules with higher p<italic>K</italic>a values.</p>

<title>High FRAP recovery but slow diffusion measured for the glycogen synthase kinase (GSK3) inhibitor SB216763</title>
<p>The GSK3 inhibitor SB216763 (p<italic>K</italic>a=7.0, M.W.=371 Da, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>) aggregates when dissolved in PBS buffer solution. However, in our previous study we have seen that aggregation of this particular small molecule drug can be reversed by adding BSA and the extent of de-aggregation depends on the amount of BSA added (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Dey et al., 2022</xref>). Here, our aim is to compare diffusion behavior of the GSK3 inhibitor in solution phase to that found in live cell cytoplasm. Since the molecule has some inherent solubility issues in PBS buffer, we compared its diffusion also in BSA protein solution and in cell culture media DMEM (Dulbecco’s modified eagle medium). Comparative FRAP profiles and D<sub>confocal</sub> rates of SB216763 in different mediums are shown in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A-C</xref>. The FRAP profiles and relative D<sub>confocal</sub> values show very slow diffusion of SB216763 in HeLa cell cytoplasm of ∼0.61±0.03 µm<sup>2</sup>s<sup>-1</sup> with a fraction recovery of 0.8 after 10s (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A-C</xref>). This is a 40-fold reduction in D<sub>confocal</sub> compared to measurements in 100 mg/mL BSA protein solution, where SB216763 is not aggregating (D<sub>confocal</sub>∼24.3±0.5 µm<sup>2</sup>s<sup>-1</sup> and fractional recovery of ∼0.9 - <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A-C</xref>). In cell culture DMEM media (containing 5% serum protein) fractional recovery after FRAP is very low (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>), indicating that the drug is still aggregating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Dey et al., 2022</xref>). Interestingly, the D<sub>confocal</sub> value in HeLa cell extract was higher ∼ 11.3±0.7 µm<sup>2</sup>s<sup>-1</sup> as is its fractional recovery (0.9), showing that HeLa cell extract, like BSA is disaggregating SB216763. Co-localization with Lysotracker-633 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D-E</xref>) shows that SB216763 colocalizes and is sequestered in acidic chambers of the cell lysosomes. Moreover, SB216763 accumulation into the lysosome increased over time (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D and E</xref>, 45-minute and 2-hour treatment). Varying drug dosages resulted in D<sub>confocal</sub> values of 0.42-0.61 µm<sup>2</sup>s<sup>-1</sup>, suggesting that the slow diffusion is not related to SB216763 concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Figure S2A-B</xref>).</p>

<title>Despite its high solubility in aqueous solution, Quinacrine diffusion in HeLa cells is slow</title>
<p>Quinacrine DHC (M.W.= 472.9 Da, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>) is a compound highly soluble in PBS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Dey et al., 2022</xref>) with a fast D<sub>confocal</sub> rate of 41.9±3.0 µm<sup>2</sup>s<sup>-1</sup> (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A-C</xref>). This rate dropped to D<sub>confocal</sub>∼2.5±0.1 µm<sup>2</sup>s<sup>-1</sup> in HeLa cell cytoplasm, with fraction recovery of ∼0.8, in comparison to one in buffer. In HeLa cell extract a D<sub>confocal</sub> rate of 15.1±0.6 µm<sup>2</sup>s<sup>-1</sup> was determined, which lays between PBS and HeLa cytoplasm. Micrographs of live HeLa cells show that the quinacrine DHC molecules aggregate in the cytoplasm. Co-localization with Lysotracker-633 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D-E</xref>) show that quinacrine colocalizes and is sequestered in acidic chambers of the cell lysosomes. Moreover, quinacrine aggregation into the lysosome increased over time (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D and E</xref>, 45-minute and 2 hours treatment). Therefore, we measured diffusion instantaneously following micro-injection, and compared it to 2 and 24 hours of incubation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">Figure S3A-B</xref>). Quinacrine accumulation in the lysosome was observed also immediately after micro-injection, with aggregation increasing over time. D<sub>confocal</sub> of 4.2±0.2 µm<sup>2</sup>s<sup>-1</sup> was calculated from line-FRAP immediately after micro-injection, slowing to 2.2±0.1 µm<sup>2</sup>s<sup>-1</sup> following 2 hours incubations, with fractional recoveries of 0.63 and 0.57 respectively. After 24 hours of incubation the fractional recovery is less than 0.25, and thus the diffusion value is meaningless (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">Figure S3C and D</xref>). Next, we compared FRAP of the cells treated with 2 and 6 µM quinacrine solutions after 2- and 24-hours incubations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4">Figure S4A-F</xref>). The concentration of quinacrine had only a marginal effect on the results. Again, following 24 hours of incubation, most of the quinacrine is in the lysosomes.</p>

<title>Inhibition of lysosomal sequestration is only slightly increasing diffusion in cells</title>
<p>Lysosome internal pH of ∼4.5 is maintained by vacuolar proton ATPase (V-H+-ATPase) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">de Duve et al., 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Kaufmann and Krise, 2007</xref>). The low p<italic>K</italic>a of weakly basic small molecule drugs drive their accumulation in the lysosome. There, they become protonated (ionic form is less-permeable), which hinders their back-diffusion to the cytosol. The phenomenon is known as cationic ion trapping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Asokan and Cho, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Kaufmann and Krise, 2007</xref>) and results in drug accumulation in lysosomes up to millimolar concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">de Duve et al., 1974</xref>). We blocked lysosomal acidification using either Bafilomycin A1 or sodium azide prior to drug administration. Bafilomycin A1 is a specific V-ATPase inhibitor and thus inhibits the supply of protons to the lysosomal chamber (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Wang et al., 2021</xref>). Sodium azide, blocks ATP generation, resulting in the disruption of cellular activities which require ATP (Hiruma et al., 2007; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Ishii et al., 2014</xref>). As a result, cationic ion trapping is inhibited. These two compounds were used to investigate whether lysosomal trapping is the cause for the 20-40-fold lower diffusion and lower fraction recovery in HeLa cells compared to buffer. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs7">Figures S7A and B</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs8">Figure S8A and B</xref> show colocalization images for GSK3 inhibitor and quinacrine, respectively (with Lysotracker-633 used as marker) after addition of 100 nM Bafilomycin A1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Yoshimori et al., 1991</xref>). The micrographs show that Bafilomycin A1 strongly reduces lysosomal volumes following quinacrine and GSK3 treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs7">Figure S7A</xref> <italic>vs</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs7">S7B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs8">S8A</xref> <italic>vs</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs8">S8B</xref>).

D<sub>confocal</sub> for the GSK3 inhibitor is ∼ 0.60±0.02 µm<sup>2</sup>s<sup>-1</sup>, and for Quinacrine ∼ 2.4±0.1 µm<sup>2</sup>s<sup>-1</sup>.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we selected well-known and widely used small molecule drugs to study their behavior in aqueous solutions and living cells. All drug molecules used here are fluorescent, allowing for their FRAP measurements. Previously, we found that small-molecule drugs diffuse differently in crowded media than in a simple buffer solution, even if aggregation is not an issue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Dey et al., 2022</xref>). Here, we show that many small molecules get trapped within the cellular cytoplasm, resulting in extremely slow diffusion and lower fractional recovery after FRAP. This is particularly observed for cationic-charged small molecules, with D<sub>confocal</sub> values of 20-40-fold lower than observed for fluorescein or CF514, which, in many cases is accompanied by low recovery after photobleaching. The later suggests that most molecules are occluded to components of the HeLa cell cytoplasm. Even dense cell extract from HeLa cells is not mimicking the <italic>in vivo</italic> results (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A and C</xref>). This is very different from protein diffusion, where none of the 16 proteins measured here showed slow diffusion or low fractional recovery, despite their <italic>E.coli</italic> origin, expressed in HeLa cells. Slow diffusion and lower fractional recovery were limited to basic small molecules, showing D<sub>confocal</sub> values of 0.2-2 µm<sup>2</sup>s<sup>-1</sup>. While the fractional recovery for all proteins is ∼0.9, for many basic small molecules it is 0.2-0.5.</p>
<p>As primary culprit for the slow diffusion of the basic small molecule drugs we suspected sequestration in the lysosomes. Indeed, high level of accumulation in the lysosomes were found for all the basic drugs. However, pre-treatment with sodium azide or Bafilomycin A1, which we showed to inhibit lysosomal accumulation, had only a small effect on diffusion or fractional recovery after FRAP, which stayed low. Therefore, we evaluated colocalization of GSK3 inhibitor with lipid droplets, the ER or nucleic acids present in cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs13">Figure S13</xref>), but did not detect any.</p>
<p>The conclusive evidence that slow diffusion and lower FRAP recovery results from the drugs being basic came by altering three molecules from being basic to acidic and vice versa. The best example here is fluorescein, where transformation to 5-amino fluorescein drastically reduced its diffusion as well as its fractional recovery after FRAP. Two additional examples here were Primaquine that was modified to Primaquine Acetate and BODIPY-NH<sub>2</sub> that was modified to BODIPY-NHAc. In both cases, the diffusion became faster and the fractional recovery increased significantly. This finding is important, as the activity of a drug within the cell is dictated by its active concentration. When the drug is sequestered, its active concentration is reduced. Even, if it is not fully sequestered, but only diffuses much slower, it will result in lower association rate constant, and thus lower affinity towards the drug target. As a result, to keep the drug active, its dose has to be increased, which can have negative implications on side effects, due to off-target binding.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Our study shows that <italic>in vitro</italic> biophysical crowding studies for small molecule drugs are of limited value if one wants to understand the biophysical behavior of the same drug within the cell. While it is true that availability of a drug within a cell is only one factor dictating its biological activity, it is a crucial one. Our findings here raise an important limitation on the standard rules for drug design, as these do not consider the stickiness of basic small molecules within the cell. We were able to directly address this question by using fluorescent molecule drugs, and measuring their location and diffusion within cells. Most importantly, we also show that by blocking protonation of a number of basic compounds we were able to increase substantially their diffusion and recovery after photobleaching, and thus potentially their activity. These findings may be consequential in future drug development.</p>

The cells were subcultured when 80% confluence was reached using trypsin-EDTA for cell detachment. 2×10<sup>5</sup> HeLa cells in 2.5 ml of DMEM were pipetted into glass-bottomed dishes and incubated overnight. The cells were cultured in a humid atmosphere at 37 °C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. The cells were imaged 24–30 h after seeding. Before the microinjection, the medium was aspirated, and fresh medium was supplemented with 25 mM HEPES, pH 7.4. For drug treatment, HeLa cells were incubated with 10 µM of drug (diluted 1:1000 from stock) for indicated times at 37 °C, followed by three times PBS 1X wash prior to imaging. For dose-dependent studies, the drug concentrations varied typically between 2-12 µM. Sodium azide concentration was 1 and 50 µM. Bafilomycin A1 was used at 100 nM concentration. Similarly, during the colocalization study, HeLa cells were treated with LysoTracker dye (1X) with 1:1000 dilution for 30 mins to 1 h at 37 °C, followed by 3x washing with PBS. Quinacrine, GSK3 inhibitor, Mitoxantrone, 5-amino Fluorescein, Amidoquine, Primaquine and BODIPY analogues were incubated with cells, while Fluorescein, Quinacrine, Primaquine-Ac, and CF514 dye were also micro-injected inside the HeLa cells.</p>

For every measurement, a single pressure pulse was applied to deliver the sample into the cell. Air was administrated at 15– 25 hPa for 0.1-0.3 s. For injections, single cells containing morphologically healthy and well-connected HeLa cells were selected.

After 20 min, the mixture was centrifuged at 13k×g. This process was repeated twice to obtain concentrated extract. A BSA calibration curve determined the total protein concentration; the final concentration was up to 100 mg/mL.

The lines we scanned were unidirectional with time intervals of 1.256 ms 1000 times (equivalent to 1.256 s) in the majority of the measurements. The number of scans prior to, during, and after the photobleaching was 10, 42, and 948, respectively. Only in some specific cellular measurements (for GSK3 inhibitor and Quinacrine DHC, where recovery is very slow) the unidirectional lines were scanned 5000 times. Photobleaching was achieved by using the laser at 405-nm or with 635-nm excitations for the 63-millisecond duration at full intensity (100%). The simultaneous scanner moved at a 100 µs/pixel speed to perform an efficient photo-bleach. We have used two simultaneous scanners during the Line-FRAP experiments: one scanner (at 405 nm with the full intensity of 100%) for photobleaching and another scanner (at 440/515/635 nm with weak intensity) for data acquisition.</p>
<p>For all the drugs except Mitoxantrone and BODIPY analogues (emission in red wavelengths), photo-bleach was performed by 405 nm laser. For fluorescence signal detection: fluorescein 440 nm laser (1-4%); CCF2 440 nm laser (1-2%); GSK3 inhibitor 440 nm laser (0-2%); quinacrine (1-2%) of maximal intensity were used. Emission collections were done from 520-550 nm for quinacrine DHC and GSK3 inhibitor.</p>
<p>Line FRAP was not possible for primaquine analogues, as it suffers from strong photo-bleach during recovery. Here classical XY FRAP was performed, with photo-bleach done by 405 nm laser with full intensity. The frame rate is maintained at 172 ms with a bleach pulse duration was 150 ms. Due to microscope setting limitations, Line FRAP is also not feasible for Mitoxantrone and BODIPY analogues. A classical XY-FRAP using two simultaneous scanners is done for these molecules. Here, bleach was performed by simultaneous 635 nm laser with the full intensity of 100%, and the main excitation was done by 635 nm laser (with the power of 4%). Emission collections were done from 655-755 nm. For BODIPY analogues FRAP recoveries, the bleach pulse time was 150 ms. The bleach pulse time was also 150 ms for primaquine analogues for comparative FRAP profile collections. The frame rate is maintained at 172 ms. Using the Olympus IX81 FluoView FV1000 Spectral/SIM Scanner confocal laser-scanning microscope, using Tornado (which requires SIM scanner to be loaded) greatly enhances bleaching efficiency. In addition, it shortens the time to obtain the first measurement after bleach (which is immediate in this mode). This property is highly beneficial for Line-FRAP measurements, where the time scale of data acquisition plays an important role. The Fluoview SIM scanner unit synchronizes laser light simulation with confocal and multiphoton imaging to avoid interruption to image observation during laser stimulation or manipulation. We have varied the intensity of the lasers to achieve an optimal signal/noise ratio. Fluorescence recovery plots were fitted to a double exponent growth curve. FRAP experiments were also performed inside the PBS buffer drops and crowding conditions. A coverslip was introduced at the top of the drop to stop evaporation during measurements. Our previously developed method on Line FRAP protocol has been employed to calculate diffusion coefficients from the FRAP rates and averaged bleach sizes. Diffusion rates cannot be calculated using XY-FRAP. However, FRAP parameters were kept constant so that qualitatively we could compare the average half-life and percentage of recoveries.</p>

<title>Determination of D<sub>confocal</sub> from FRAP results</title>
<p>We previously developed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Dey et al., 2021</xref>) the FRAP in Line mode (Line FRAP) method to monitor the diffusion rates of proteins in various environments. Line-FRAP allows a much faster data acquisition rate compared to classical XY FRAP. It is more suitable for measuring diffusion rates for fast diffusing molecules. The apparent diffusion coefficients calculated from Line FRAP measurements are D<sub>confocal</sub>, which are calculated according to <xref rid="eqn1" ref-type="disp-formula">equation 1</xref>:
<disp-formula id="eqn1">

</disp-formula>
where t<sub>1/2</sub> is the half-time of recovery and r<sub>e</sub> and r<sub>n</sub> is the effective and nominal bleach radii values (for details see (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Dey et al., 2021</xref>)).</p>
<p>To calculate D<sub>confocal</sub> at least 30 independent measurements on different cells (n) were binned, and the curve fit of the progression curve was used to obtain t<sub>1/2</sub>, and r<sub>e</sub> values and their associated errors as determined from the fit of the curve. r<sub>n</sub> was obtained from bleaching a fixed sample. The standard errors (SE) of the individual parameters were combined to obtain D<sub>confocal</sub>±SE. To verify SE values, we repeated the 30 measurements independently multiple times, which gave the same SE as obtained from individual curve fits of n = 30 cells.</p>

<p>This is a <bold>valuable</bold> study on the diffusion rates of drug molecules in human-derived cells, highlighting that their diffusion behavior depends on their charged state. It proposes that blocking drug protonation enhances diffusion and fractional recovery, suggesting improved intracellular availability of weakly basic drugs. The correlation between pKa and intracellular diffusion is <bold>solid</bold> and well-supported, but the study would benefit from a more rigorous statistical treatment and a balanced comparison across different types of compounds. Despite these limitations, the findings are significant for drug design and understanding the biophysical behavior of small molecules in cells.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors set out to measure the diffusion of small drug molecules inside live cells. To do this, they selected a range of flourescent drugs, as well as some commonly used dyes, and used FRAP to quantify their diffusion. The authors find that drugs diffuse and localize within the cell in a way that is weakly correalted with their charge, with positively charged molecules displaying dramatically slower diffusion and a high degree of subcellular localization.</p>
<p>
The study is important because it points at an important issue related to the way drugs behave inside cells beyond the simple &quot;IC50&quot; metric (a decidedly mesoscopic/systemic value). The authors conclude, and I agree, that their results point to nuanced effects that are governed by drug chemistry that could be optimized to make them more effective.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The work examines an understudied aspect of drug delivery.</p>
<p>
The work uses well-established methodologies to measure diffusion in cells</p>
<p>
The work provides an extensive dataset, covering a range of chemistries that are common in small molecule drug design</p>
<p>
The authors consider several explanations as to the origin of changes in cellular diffusion</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The results are described qualitatively, despite quantitative data that can be used to infer the strength of the proposed correlations.</p>
<p>
The statistical treatment of the data is not rigorous and not visualized according to best practices, making it difficult for readers to assess the significance of the findings.</p>
<p>
Some important aspects of drug behavior are not discussed quantitatively, such as the cell-to-cell or subcellular variability in concentration.</p>
<p>
It is unclear if the observed behavior of each drug in the cell actually relates to its efficacy - though this is clearly beyond the scope of this specific work.</p>

<p>Summary: Blocking a weak base compound's protonation increased intracellular diffusion and fractional recovery in the cytoplasm, which may improve the intracellular availability and distribution of weakly basic, small molecule drugs and be impactful in future drug development.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>1. The intracellular distribution of drugs and the chemical properties that drive their distribution are much needed in the literature. Thus, the idea behind this paper is of relevance.</p>
<p>2. The study used common compounds that were relevant to others.</p>
<p>3. Altering a compound's pKa value and measuring cytosolic diffusion rates certainly is inciteful on how weak base drugs and their relatively high pKa values affect distribution and pharmacokinetics. This particular experiment demonstrated relevance to drug targeting and drug development.</p>
<p>4. The manuscript was fairly well written.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>1. Small sample sizes. 2 acids and 1 neutral compound vs 6 weak bases (Figure 1).</p>
<p>2. A comparison between the percentage of neutral and weak base drug accumulation in lysosomes would have helped indicate weak base ion trapping. Such a comparison would have strengthened this study.</p>
<p>3. When cytosolic diffusion rates of compounds were measured, were the lysosomes extracted from the image using Imaris to determine a realistic cytosolic value? In real-time, lysosomes move through the cytosol at different rates. Because weak base drugs get trapped, it is likely the movement of a weak base in the lysosome being measured rather than the movement of a weak base itself throughout the cytosol. This was unclear in the methods. Please explain.</p>
<p>4. Because weak base drugs can be protonated in the cytoplasm, the authors need to elaborate on why they thought that inhibiting lysosome accumulation of weak bases would increase cytosolic diffusion rates. Ion trapping is different than &quot;micrometers per second&quot; in the cytosol. Moreover, treating cells with sodium azide de-acidifies lysosomes and acidifies the cytosol; thus, more protons in the cytosol means more protonation of weak base drugs. The diffusion rates were slowed down in the presence of lysosome inhibition (Figure 7), which is more fitting of the story about blocking protonation increases diffusion rates, but in this case, increasing cytosolic protonation via lysosome de-acidification agents decreases diffusion rates. Please elaborate.</p>
<p>A discussion of the likely impact:</p>
<p>
The manuscript certainly adds another dimension to the field of intracellular drug distribution, but the manuscript needs to be strengthened in its current form. Additional experiments need to be included, and there are clarifications in the manuscript that need to be addressed. Once these issues are resolved, then the manuscript, if the conclusions are further strengthened, is much needed and would be inciteful to drug development.</p>
