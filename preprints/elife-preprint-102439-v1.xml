<title>Summary</title><p>Polyamines are biologically ubiquitous cations that bind to nucleic acids, ribosomes, and phospholipids and, thereby, modulate numerous processes, including surface motility in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>. We characterized the metabolic and transcription factors that contribute to polyamine-dependent control of surface motility. Genetic analysis showed that surface motility required type 1 pili and the simultaneous presence of two independent putrescine anabolic pathways and that putrescine transport and catabolism modulated surface motility. The results of an immunological assay for FimA—the major pili subunit, reverse transcription quantitative PCR of <italic>fimA</italic>, and transmission electron microscopy confirmed that pili synthesis required putrescine. RNAseq analysis of a parental and putrescine-deficient mutant and a follow-up genetic analysis suggested that H-NS was the putrescine-responsive regulator of pili synthesis and surface motility. The RNAseq results also showed that low putrescine increased transcripts for genes of arginine synthesis and transport systems for magnesium and phosphate, and decreased transcripts of genes for oxidative energy metabolism and iron transport. We conclude that (a) putrescine controls pili synthesis and surface motility possibly via the transcriptional regulator H-NS, and (b) a complex homeostatic network, which can rewire metabolism, controls putrescine concentrations. During a urinary tract infection, the polyamine putrescine is present in urine and pili are required for the binding of bacteria to the bladder epithelium. Because of its control of pili synthesis and energy metabolism, putrescine is likely to contribute to the establishment and maintenance of urinary tract infections associated with uropathogenic <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Polyamines are flexible aliphatic cations that are found in virtually all organisms. <italic>E. coli</italic> contains putrescine (1,4-diaminobutane) and lesser amounts of spermidine (N-(3-aminopropyl)-1,4-diaminobutane), and cadaverine (1,5-diaminopentane) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>). Both the pathways and enzymes of polyamine synthesis are redundant (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). Strains that lack eight of these genes do not contain detectable polyamines, grow slowly aerobically, and do not grow anaerobically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>). Polyamines interact with nucleic acids and phospholipids, can affect chromosome and ribosome structure, ribosome-mRNA interactions, and protein and nucleic acid elongation rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>). Polyamines modulate, but are not required for, protein synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>) and expression of hundreds of genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>). A major mechanism of polyamine-dependent regulation is translational control of genes for 18 major transcription regulators: four of the seven σ factors – σ<sup>18</sup> (FecI), σ<sup>24</sup> (RpoE), σ<sup>38</sup> (RpoS), and σ<sup>54</sup> (RpoN); three histone-like DNA-binding proteins (Fis, H-NS, and StpA); and CpxR, Cya, Cra, and UvrY (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>).</p>

<p>Polyamines control flagella-dependent surface motility of <italic>Proteus mirabilis</italic> and pili-dependent surface motility (PDSM) of <italic>E. coli</italic>: the latter has been reported to require the polyamine spermidine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>). While reconstructing putrescine-deficient strains to characterize the basis for the anaerobic growth defect, we noticed that a mutant unable to synthesize spermidine moved normally, while mutants lacking enzymes of putrescine synthesis moved poorly. We characterized the role of polyamines on <italic>E. coli</italic> surface motility and pili synthesis by genetic analysis, ELISA assays, RT-qPCR, electron microscopy, and RNAseq. We showed that PDSM and pili synthesis required two independent pathways of putrescine synthesis, but did not require spermidine, and was modulated by putrescine transport and catabolism. In addition to confirming that putrescine controlled pili synthesis, results from an RNAseq analysis identified regulators that mediated putrescine-dependent control, and, unexpectedly, suggested a putrescine homeostatic network that rewires metabolism to maintain intracellular putrescine.</p>

<title>Pili-dependent surface motility (PDSM) of W3110</title>
<p>While characterizing mutants lacking putrescine synthetic enzymes, we found that some strains were defective in surface motility. Because any single laboratory strain may have properties that result from unintended laboratory evolution, we assessed nine strains for their surface motility pattern. Five strains covered a plate in 12-18 hours, while four did not traverse a plate in 36 hours. The slow-moving strains generated genetically stable fast-moving variants which suggests that the former were ancestral. Our lab strain of W3110 moved slowly, and among the slow movers showed the least variability in spreading diameter and generated fewer fast-moving variants. Its outward movement formed concentric rings, with alternating phases of movement and consolidation/growth (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A</xref>). Deletion of <italic>fimA</italic>, which codes for the major type 1 pili subunit, abolished the oscillatory pattern and reduced, but did not eliminate, surface motility, but deletion of <italic>fliC</italic> which encodes the major flagellum subunit did not affect surface motility (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). Electron microscopy confirmed that W3110-LR isolated from surface motility plates possessed pili (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>). None of &gt;500 cells expressed flagella. A mixed population of elongated (3-4 µm) and non-elongated (&lt;2 µm) cells were visible, and pili were mostly associated with elongated cells. Furthermore, W3110 surface motility requires glucose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>) which should prevent flagella synthesis via inhibition of cyclic AMP synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>). We confirmed that glucose controlled flagella synthesis in W3110 by its suppression of swimming motility (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2C</xref>). A W3110-LR derivative with deletions of both <italic>fliC</italic> and <italic>fimA</italic> still exhibited outward movement on a surface motility plate (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A</xref>), but electron microscopy showed the absence of appendages (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>). In summary, genetics, electron microscopy, and a glucose requirement show that W3110 surface motility requires pili.</p>

<title>PDSM required two independent putrescine synthesis pathways</title>
<p>We examined PDSM requirements for polyamine anabolic pathways. A major putrescine biosynthetic pathway is ornithine decarboxylation either by the constitutive SpeC or the low-pH inducible SpeF. The Δ<italic>speC</italic> and Δ<italic>speF</italic> mutants moved as well as the parental strain, but a Δ<italic>speC</italic> Δ<italic>speF</italic> double mutant moved less well (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). SpeA (arginine decarboxylase) and SpeB (agmatinase) catalyze an alternate two-step putrescine synthetic pathway (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>): deletion of either gene reduced surface motility (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). The D<italic>speA</italic>, D<italic>speB</italic>, and D<italic>speC</italic> D<italic>speF</italic> strains grew as well as the parental strain (Supplemental Figure 1A) and had normal swimming motility (Supplemental Figure 1B). A <italic>ΔspeE</italic> mutant, which lacks the enzyme for spermidine synthesis, moved on a surface as well as the parental strain (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref>).</p>

In summary, PDSM required the simultaneous presence of two independent pathways of putrescine synthesis but did not require spermidine.</p>

<title>Loss of putrescine transport systems affected surface motility</title>
<p>Putrescine transport may maintain an appropriate intracellular putrescine concentration, because <italic>E. coli</italic> secretes putrescine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>). <italic>E. coli</italic> has several putrescine transport systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>). Mutants lacking the PlaP and PotF putrescine transporters had 50% and 40% reduced surface motility, respectively, and lost the concentric ring pattern (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). Loss of the PotE and PuuP transporters affected neither the movement diameter (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>) nor concentric ring formation (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). We note that <italic>potE</italic> and <italic>plaP</italic> are more highly expressed than <italic>potE</italic> and <italic>puuP</italic> (85, 64, 17, and 6 counts per million transcripts, respectively) for W3110 grown in liquid motility medium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>). We conclude that extracellular putrescine and its transport contribute to PDSM.</p>

<title>Putrescine catabolism affected surface motility</title>
<p>Because putrescine catabolism modulates intracellular putrescine concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>), we examined PDSM in putrescine catabolic mutants. The major putrescine catabolic pathway is initiated with putrescine glutamylation (reactions 6-9, and 4-5, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6A</xref>), and a second pathway initiates with putrescine deamination (reactions 1-5, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>). Deletion of either <italic>puuA</italic> or <italic>patA</italic> which code for the first enzymes of their respective pathways did not affect surface motility (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6B</xref>). A double mutant moved less well which was unexpected because the proposed higher intracellular putrescine should have stimulated PDSM. Consistent with the stimulatory effect of putrescine, loss of <italic>puuR</italic> which codes for the repressor of PuuA-initiated pathway genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>), impaired PDSM (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6B</xref>). One possible explanation to reconcile these seemingly contradictory results is that an optimal polyamine concentration stimulates PDSM, and a high concentration is inhibitory. Experiments that are described in the next section test this possibility.</p>

<title>High putrescine reduced expression of pili genes</title>
<p>High putrescine inhibits translation of some mRNAs, and high spermidine, a product of putrescine metabolism, inhibits growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>). If the phenotype of the Δ<italic>patA</italic> Δ<italic>puuA</italic> double mutant results from spermidine toxicity, then loss of spermidine synthase (SpeE) should reverse the phenotype. This prediction was not met which argues against spermidine toxicity (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6C</xref>). For the <italic>speB</italic> mutant, 1 mM putrescine stimulated PDSM, and 4 mM putrescine was slightly inhibitory but eliminated the ring pattern (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig 7AB</xref>). The concentric ring pattern was observed with 1 mM, but not 4 mM putrescine. Indirect enzyme linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) against FimA showed that the level of FimA in the <italic>speB</italic> mutant at 1 mM putrescine was higher than with 4 mM putrescine (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7C</xref>). Variation of supplemental putrescine did not affect FimA in the parental strain (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7C</xref>).</p>

Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) showed that pili expression was highest for the <italic>speB</italic> mutant at 1 mM putrescine (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>), moderate at 0.1- and 4-mM putrescine, and undetectable without putrescine.

<title>Evidence for a homeostatic network that maintains intracellular putrescine</title>

<p>Loss of <italic>speB</italic> also affected pathways of energy metabolism.

In addition to these differences, the <italic>speB</italic> mutant also had fewer transcripts for all genes of iron acquisition, which is consistent with diminished energy generation.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>PDSM and pili synthesis required putrescine synthesis and were affected by putrescine degradation and transport, as well as several transcription factors, which implies that numerous factors control intracellular putrescine concentrations. The effect of loss of putrescine transport systems on PDSM implicates extracellular putrescine on putrescine homeostasis. A requirement for the SpeA-SpeB pathway implicates extracellular arginine since SpeA is mostly periplasmic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>). The role of both putrescine synthesis and degradation suggests rapid adjustments to fluctuating putrescine concentrations. Numerous transcription factors control pili synthesis. Of these, only the gene for H-NS had fewer transcripts in the <italic>speB</italic> mutant, which is consistent with H-NS mediating putrescine-dependent control. This conclusion is not considered strong because of the only two-fold transcript reduction, and because of numerous changes in transcripts for other potential pili regulations in the <italic>speB</italic> mutant, albeit in the wrong direction. Therefore, we cannot exclude a general regulatory dysfunction mediated by depleted levels of putrescine as the basis for loss of pili synthesis.</p>
<p>An unexpected observation was that the <italic>speB</italic> mutant had more transcripts for genes whose products will maintain intracellular putrescine, i.e., compensatory mechanisms for low intracellular putrescine (<xref rid="fig11" ref-type="fig">Figure 11</xref>). Conversely, loss of <italic>speB</italic> lowered transcripts for many genes of energy metabolism and all genes of iron acquisition. This gene expression pattern suggests a diversion of metabolism away from energy generation and toward putrescine synthesis, i.e., a prioritization of putrescine synthesis over aerobic energy metabolism.</p>
<p>We also propose that other changes are also compensatory mechanisms for low intracellular putrescine, specifically, more transcripts for genes coding for magnesium and phosphate transport systems in the <italic>speB</italic> mutant. To the extent that magnesium can directly replace putrescine, e.g., binding to nucleotides and RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>), magnesium could compensate for low putrescine. Our observations confirm those of J. Slauch and colleagues on an inverse correlation between intracellular magnesium and polyamines in <italic>Salmonella</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>). They proposed an overall divalent cation homeostasis maintained by either magnesium or the polyamines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>). A rationale for the effect on phosphate metabolism is not obvious but considering the effects of low putrescine on energy metabolism, increased phosphate transport may be an adjustment to changes in energy metabolism. In any case, the substantial changes in gene expression due to low putrescine suggest multiple compensatory mechanisms, and a homeostatic gene network which because of effects on metabolic genes can rewire metabolism.</p>
<p>In contrast to our results, a thorough and well-designed study showed that <italic>E. coli</italic> PDSM requires spermidine instead of putrescine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>). The differences between the studies were strain backgrounds, media (glucose-LB vs glucose-tryptone), and incubation temperature (33⁰ vs 37⁰). We found PDSM results for 37⁰ incubations were highly variable and resulted in numerous fast-moving variants. Since growth at the higher temperature is faster, and faster growth is associated with higher putrescine, we propose that growth at 37⁰ results in an inhibitory putrescine concentration. In this case, spermidine would be stimulatory because of its known inhibition of the putrescine biosynthetic enzymes SpeA and SpeC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>) and subsequent reduction of intracellular putrescine to an optimal concentration.</p>
<p>The transcript changes observed in our study were different from those in the only other systematic study of putrescine’s effect on <italic>E. coli</italic> gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>). Both studies had almost identical experimental design: 1.0- or 1.14-mM putrescine was added to either a <italic>speB</italic> or <italic>speB speC</italic> mutant, respectively. Differences in strains, growth media (minimal media vs tryptone-containing media), and growth temperature (33⁰ vs 37⁰) could account for the discrepancy in results. The most crucial difference could be the growth media: Igarashi and colleagues grew bacteria in a minimal medium, while we grew bacteria in an amino acid-containing medium that was required for surface motility. We propose that the slower growth in minimal medium correlates with higher guanosine tetraphosphate and in turn counters and obscures many growth-stimulatory putrescine effects. In contrast, the growth stimulation from the amino acids in our medium would not counter putrescine effects and would essentially allow detection of effects caused solely by changes in putrescine concentrations. Regardless of the explanation, common results can be interpreted as core responses to putrescine limitation. Both studies observed that low putrescine increased transcripts for genes of arginine synthesis and magnesium transport, and reduced transcripts for the <italic>sdhCDAB</italic>-<italic>sucABCD</italic> operon which codes for TCA cycle enzymes. The link between putrescine and arginine synthesis is probably mediated by the ArgR repressor because <italic>argR</italic> transcripts are 2.5-fold lower (FDR = 0.0004) in the <italic>speB</italic> mutant (Supplemental Table 1). Cyclic AMP may mediate putrescine-dependent control of the <italic>sdh</italic>-<italic>suc</italic> operon because putrescine controls translation of <italic>cya</italic> mRNA, which codes for adenylate cyclase, and cyclic-AMP controls the <italic>sdhCDAB</italic>-<italic>sucABCD</italic> operon. As noted above, the link between putrescine and magnesium transport is a recent observation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>).</p>
<p>Several results implicate putrescine in <italic>E. coli</italic> virulence during urinary tract infections. First, pili-dependent binding to the urothelium is an essential step for uropathogenic <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>). Second, putrescine is present in urine from infected, but not healthy individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>). Third, urinary putrescine can result from UPEC growth in urine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>) and urothelial pathophysiology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>). Putrescine’s possible role in virulence is seemingly contradicted by the observation that a <italic>speB</italic> mutant outcompetes the parental CFT073 in the bladder of mice, i.e., less putrescine synthesis enhanced virulence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>). A majority of uropathogenic <italic>E. coli</italic> are associated with phylogenetic group B2―including CFT073, whereas most <italic>E. coli</italic> lab strains, such as W3110, are group A. Group B2 strains lack genes for the major putrescine catabolic pathway and have significantly higher transcripts for genes coding for SpeA and SpeB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>). Both observations suggest that the cytoplasmic putrescine concentration is higher in group B2 strains. We propose that the putrescine concentration in group B2 strains is normally in the inhibitory range for pili synthesis, and that loss of SpeB reduces putrescine to a level that stimulates pili synthesis. Regardless of the explanation, putrescine is likely to be important during urinary tract infections, but aspects of putrescine control of pili synthesis and other processes could be different in uropathogenic <italic>E. coli</italic> and is worth further examination.</p>

<p>For P1 transductions and plasmid transformation experiments, cells were grown in standard LB liquid medium (1% tryptone, 1% NaCl and 0.5% yeast extract, pH 7.0) at 37°C. Antibiotics were used for selection at concentrations of 25 µg/mL (both chloramphenicol and kanamycin).

One microgram of RNA was reverse transcribed using LunaScript RT Super Mix (NEB E3010) and another microgram was subjected to the same reaction as the reverse transcribed RNA, except without reverse transcriptase (negative control) following manufacturer instructions. The cDNA was then diluted to 10 ng/µL for qPCR. PCR reactions were composed of 10 ng cDNA, 8 µL of nuclease free water, 10 nM primers (rpoD: Forward: TCGTGTTGAAGCAGAAGAAGCG; Reverse: TCGTCATCGCCATCTTCTTCG) (fimA: Forward: ATGGTGGGACCGTTCACTTT; Reverse: GGCAACAGCGGCTTTAGATG), and PowerUp SYBR Green 2X master mix for qPCR (ThermoFisher A25777) in a 20 µL reaction. A Quantstudio 3 qPCR machine was used to generate critical threshold (Ct) values. The Ct values were then analyzed using the 2<sup>-ΔΔC</sup><sub>T</sub> method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>) using <italic>rpoD</italic> as a library control.</p>

<title>RNAseq Analysis</title>
<p>Transcripts were aligned to the W3110 genome and CDS (CP165600) available on NCBI using CLC genomics workbench (Qiagen version 22.00) for RNA-seq analysis. The gene expression counts generated as this output were used to perform differentially expressed gene (DEG) analysis using EdgeR (version 3.38.4) to analyze read counts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>). DEGs had an adjusted P-value less than 0.05.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Ita Mehta and colleagues have investigated the role of putrescine in the pili-dependent surface motility of a laboratory strain of Escherichia coli. Enterobacteria, and particularly E. coli and Salmonella Typhimurium contain an enormous amount of putrescine and cadaverine compared to other bacteria. It has been estimated by Igarashi and colleagues that putrescine is present in E. coli at levels of at least 30 mM. Therefore, an investigation of the role of putrescine in E. coli is a welcome and important contribution to understanding polyamine function. The authors have used a comprehensive suite of E. coli gene deletion strains of putrescine biosynthetic, transport, and catabolic genes to understand the role of putrescine in pili-dependent surface motility.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Single gene deletions of arginine decarboxylase (speA) and agmatine ureohydrolase (speB), and a double gene deletion of the constitutive ornithine decarboxylase (speC) and the acid-inducible ornithine decarboxylase (speF), all of which are involved in putrescine biosynthesis, were found by the authors to be less efficient at pili-dependent surface motility. In addition, the putrescine transport genes plaP and potF are also required for efficient pili-dependent surface motility. Furthermore, the putrescine catabolic genes patA and puuA, when co-deleted, reduce pili-dependent surface motility. Transcriptomic analysis of the agmatine ureohydrolase (speB) gene deletion strain compared to the parental strain indicates a coordinated response to the speB gene deletion, including upregulation of ornithine biosynthetic genes and a downregulation of energy metabolic genes.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Because the cellular content of putrescine and other polyamines in the E. coli strains was not measured at any point in this study, and the gene deletions were not genetically complemented, it is not possible to definitively attribute physiological changes to the gene deletion strains specifically to changes in putrescine levels. Furthermore, the GT medium used for the mobility experiments contains trypsinated casein (tryptone), which may contain polyamines and most certainly contain arginine. There are two modes of putrescine biosynthesis in E. coli: one mode is the direct formation of putrescine from L-ornithine mediated by ornithine decarboxylase, and the other is the indirect pathway involving decarboxylation of arginine to form agmatine, followed by hydrolysis of agmatine to form putrescine and urea. In the absence of external arginine, putrescine is made by ornithine decarboxylase, however, in the presence of external arginine, ornithine biosynthesis is repressed and arginine decarboxylase becomes the primary biosynthetic route for putrescine biosynthesis. The GT medium used by the authors will tend to favor putrescine production from arginine. The speB gene deletion, which is used for the transcriptomic analyses, will even in the absence of external arginine, accumulate a very large amount of agmatine, greater than the level of putrescine. This will confound the interpretation of the effect of the speB gene deletion, because agmatine accumulation may be responsible for some of the effects, and the addition of external putrescine may repress agmatine accumulation. In the absence of polyamine level measurements, the relative levels of agmatine, the putrescine structural analog cadaverine, and the accumulation of decarboxylated S-adenosylmethionine, are not known. Changes to these metabolites could affect pili-dependent surface motility. Furthermore, it is not possible to conclude that the effects of gene deletions to biosynthetic, transport or catabolic genes on pili-dependent surface motility are due to changes in putrescine levels unless one takes it on faith that there must be changes to putrescine levels. Since E. coli contains such an enormous amount of putrescine, it is important to know how much putrescine must be depleted in order to exert a physiological effect.</p>
<p>The authors have tackled an important biomedical problem relevant to infections of the urogenital tract and also important for understanding the very unusual high level of putrescine in E. coli and related species. However, without confirmation of putrescine levels in their various strains, it would be difficult to unequivocally conclude that putrescine, or changes to its concentrations, are responsible for the physiological changes seen with the gene deletion strains.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Mehta et al., in constructing E. coli strains unable to synthesize polyamines, noted that strains deficient in putrescine synthesis showed decreased movement on semisolid agar. They show that strains incapable of synthesizing putrescine have decreased expression of Type I pilin and, hence, decreased ability to perform pilin-dependent surface motility.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors characterize the specific polyamine pathways that are important for this phenomenon. RNAseq provides a detailed overview of gene expression in the strain lacking putrescine. The data suggest homeostatic control of polyamine synthesis and metabolic changes in response to putrescine.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>In this version, the authors ignore phase variation of the pil operon promoter, which can be monitored via PCR. The gene expression data suggest that shifting to the pilin &quot;off&quot; state could help explain the phenotype.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This study by Mehta et al. describes the mechanisms behind the observation that putrescine biosynthesis mutants in Escherichia coli strain W3110 are affected by surface motility. The manuscript shows that the surface motility phenotype is dependent on Type I fimbriae and that putrescine levels affect the expression level of fimbriae. The results further suggest that without putrescine, the metabolism of the cell is shifted towards the production of putrescine and away from energy metabolism.</p>
<p>There are two main aspects in the manuscript.</p>
<p>(1) The first observation is that a fimA mutant modified/decreased the motility phenotype. From this result, the authors conclude that type I fimbriae (or pili) are involved in the surface motility phenotype. Type I fimbriae are typically known to be involved in non-motile phenotypes, such as biofilm formation or adhesion. Type I fimbriae are also co-regulated with other surface structures that might impact motility. Thus, more controls are needed before concluding that the surface motility requires the type I fimbriae. For instance, the authors should have complemented the mutants and should have verified the flagella expression/motility in the fimA mutant.</p>
<p>(2) The second observation is that putrescine also impacts the surface motility phenotype and the expression of type I fimbriae. Although there is no genetic complementation, here the exogenous addition of putrescine to the speB mutant provides a chemical complementation method, which makes the data stronger.</p>
<p>In addition, testing the effect of putrescine on motility and type I fimbriae expression in additional strains of E. coli would strengthen the conclusion. This is especially important since the results are somewhat different from previous results obtained with a different strain of E. coli. The authors do note that experimental conditions are different, but testing their theory would make the conclusions stronger.</p>
