<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Sound encoding depends on the precise and reliable neurotransmission at the afferent synapses between the sensory inner hair cells (IHCs) and spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs). The molecular mechanisms contributing to the formation, as well as interplay between the pre- and postsynaptic components remain largely unclear. Here, we tested the role of the synaptic adhesion molecule and Nogo/RTN4 receptor homolog RTN4RL2 (also referred to as NgR2) in the development and function of afferent IHC-SGN synapses. Upon deletion of RTN4RL2 in mice (RTN4RL2<sup>-/-</sup>), presynaptic IHC active zones showed enlarged synaptic ribbons and a depolarized shift in the activation of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels. The postsynaptic densities (PSDs) of SGNs were smaller and deficient of GluA2/3 despite maintained Gria2 mRNA expression in SGNs. Next to synaptically engaged PSDs we observed “orphan” PSDs located away from IHCs. They likely belong to a subset of SGN peripheral neurites that do not contact the IHCs in RTN4RL2<sup>-/-</sup> cochleae as found by volume electron microscopy reconstruction of SGN neurites. Auditory brainstem responses of RTN4RL2<sup>-/-</sup> mice showed increased sound thresholds indicating impaired hearing. Together, these findings suggest that RTN4RL2 contributes to the proper formation and function of auditory afferent synapses and is critical for normal hearing.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Hearing relies upon the correct formation and maturation of cochlear afferent synapses between postsynaptic type I spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs) and presynaptic inner hair cells (IHCs; reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Johnson et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bulankina and Moser, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Appler and Goodrich, 2011</xref>). In mice, SGN neurites extend and reach IHCs at late embryonic stages (E16.5; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Koundakjian, Appler, and Goodrich, 2007</xref>), whereby early synaptic contacts are established between the two cells at E18 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Michanski et al., 2019</xref>). Developmental changes and maturation of afferent synapses continue until the onset of hearing (p12), with further refinement occurring till the fourth postnatal week (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Wong et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Liberman and Liberman, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Michanski et al., 2019</xref>). In mature cochleae, each IHC receives a contact from 5-30 SGNs, while each SGN contacts only one active zone (AZ) of one IHC in the majority of cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Meyer and Moser, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Hua et al., 2021</xref>).</p>
<p>To this date, multiple mechanisms have been implicated in SGN neurite guidance and establishment of IHC innervation by SGNs, including signaling via EphrinA5-EphA4, Neuropilin2/Semaphorin3F, Semaphorin5B/PlexinA1, Semaphorin3A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Defourny et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Coate et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Jung et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Cantu-Guerra et al., 2023</xref>). Less is known about the molecules governing the transsynaptic organization at IHC afferent synapses. Similar to the central conventional synapses, synaptic adhesion proteins such as neurexins and neuroligins have been suggested to play a role in pre- and postsynaptic assemblies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Ramirez et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Jukic et al., 2024</xref>). Furthermore, the Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 extracellular auxiliary subunit Ca<sub>V</sub>α<sub>2</sub>δ<sub>2</sub> was indicated to be important for proper alignment of presynaptic IHC AZs and postsynaptic densities (PSDs) of SGNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Fell et al., 2015</xref>).</p>
<p>Whether reticulon 4 receptors (RTN4Rs) contribute to setting up afferent connectivity in the cochlea remained to be investigated. The RTN4 receptor family consists of 3 homologous proteins RTN4R, RTN4RL1 and RTN4RL2. RTN4Rs are leucine-rich repeat (LRR) and glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchored cell surface receptors (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). Their primary role is thought to limit synaptic plasticity and axonal outgrowth as well as to restrict axonal regeneration after injury (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Mironova and Giger, 2013</xref>). While RTN4R and RTN4RL1 are involved in axonal guidance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Vaccaro et al., 2022</xref>), RTN4RL2 has been proposed to be important for innervation of the epidermis by dorsal root ganglion neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Bäumer et al., 2014</xref>). Furthermore, RTN4Rs are suggested to control the number and the development of synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Wills et al., 2012</xref>) and to play a role in transsynaptic signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Wang et al., 2021</xref>). Recent single-cell transcriptomic studies of the cochlea detected the expression of RTN4Rs in SGNs and IHCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Shrestha et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Jean et al., 2023</xref>). Here, we investigated the role of RTN4RL2 in the cochlea using previously described RTN4RL2 constitutive knock-out mice (RTN4RL2<sup>-/-</sup>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Wörter et al., 2009</xref>). We found RTN4RL2 to be expressed in SGNs and to be required for normal hearing: auditory brainstem responses were impaired upon RTN4RL2 deletion. We discovered both pre- and postsynaptic alterations of IHC-SGN synapses in RTN4RL2<sup>-/-</sup> mice: presynaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels of IHCs required stronger depolarization to activate and PSDs seemed deficient of GluA2/3. Additionally, a subset of type I SGN neurites did not contact IHCs but likely still feature “orphan” PSDs.</p>

<title>RTN4RL2 is expressed both in hair cells and spiral ganglion neurons</title>
<p>Recent transcriptomic data had detected RTN4RL2 expression both in hair cells and SGNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Elkon et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Liu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Shrestha et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Jean et al., 2023</xref>). We verified this by performing RNAscope staining in mid-modiolar sections of the cochlea and detected expression of RTN4RL2 mRNA both in outer and inner hair cells, as well as SGNs (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B, C</xref>). Spiral ganglia of RTN4RL2<sup>-/-</sup> mice were lacking RTN4RL2-specific mRNA puncta (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>), demonstrating specific detection of RTN4RL2 expression in hair cells and SGNs. Next, we performed immunostaining and found specific RTN4RL2 immunofluorescence in SGN somata, which was not present in the absence of the primary antibody (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>, E) or on SGN somata of RTN4RL2<sup>-/-</sup> mice (data not shown).</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<title>RTN4RL2 is important for the correct development of the auditory afferent synapses</title>
<p>To probe the role of RTN4RL2 in the cochlea, we first studied the numbers of cochlear cells in RTN4RL2<sup>-/-</sup> mice. We did not observe any change in SGN density or counts of inner and outer hair cells at p15, 1-month- and 2-month-old mice (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>-figure supplement 1). Given that RTN4RL2 has been implicated in synapse formation and development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Wills et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Borrie et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Wang et al., 2021</xref>) we immunolabeled IHC afferent synapses for presynaptic RIBEYE/Ctbp2 and postsynaptic Homer1 in mice at the age of 3 weeks. While we did not detect any change in the number of synaptic ribbons in RTN4RL2<sup>-/-</sup> IHCs, ribbon volumes were bigger (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C, D</xref>; Figure 2-figure supplement 2). Interestingly, in addition to the Homer1 positive puncta juxtaposing presynaptic ribbons, we observed additional Homer1 patches, which appeared to be away from IHCs, potentially marking “orphan” PSDs (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A, B</xref>). Moreover, the Homer1 puncta juxtaposing IHC AZs were significantly smaller in RTN4RL2<sup>-/-</sup> mice compared to the control IHCs (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>). While we found the percentage of presynaptic ribbons juxtaposing Homer1 immunofluorescent puncta to be decreased by approximately 7% in RTN4RL2<sup>-/-</sup> mice (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>), we cannot exclude that our immunolabeling protocol lacked the sensitivity to detect smaller synaptically engaged PSDs. Out of the four pore-forming AMPA receptor subunits (GluA1-4), mature SGNs express GluA2-4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Niedzielski and Wenthold, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Matsubara et al., 1996</xref>). Our immunolabeling of anti-GluA2/3 revealed a severe reduction of GluA2/3 positive puncta in RTN4RL2<sup>-/-</sup>, indicating possible lack or decrease of GluA2/3 (Figure 2-figure supplement 3A, B). Interestingly, the remaining GluA2/3 patches did not properly juxtapose presynaptic ribbons (Figure 2-figure supplement 3C). Despite this, the expression of Gria2 RNA appeared to be maintained in SGNs, as indicated by RNAscope (Figure 2-figure supplement 3D). To check if the “orphan” PSDs away from IHCs were possibly erroneously engaged with efferent presynaptic terminals we stained the latter for synapsin, which is lacking from IHCs, but did not observe any obvious juxtaposition between the “orphan” Homer1 and synapsin puncta (Figure 2-figure supplement 4).</p>

<title>Additional non-synaptic neurites in the cochlea of RTN4RL2<sup>-/-</sup> mice</title>
<p>To further examine the afferent cochlear connectivity, we utilized serial block-face scanning electron microscopy (SBEM) to 3D reconstruct the apical cochlea segments from two RTN4RL2<sup>-/-</sup> and one littermate RTN4RL2<sup>+/+</sup> control mice at p36 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). As recently demonstrated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Hua et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Lu et al., 2024</xref>), the spatial resolution of SBEM allows reliable ribbon synapse identification and neurite reconstruction (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B and C</xref>). In these three datasets, we have traced 133 neural fibers from their postsynaptic ending in the organ Corti towards the modiolus, of which 115 were classified as peripheral neurites of type I SGN based on their radial calibers and extensive myelination after entering the habenula perforata (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>). We observed a substantial number of neurites that did not engage the IHCs (non-synaptic neurites) in the RTN4RL2<sup>-/-</sup> organs of Corti (23 out of 83) in contrast to the wild-type control (3 out of 32, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>). Although most non-synaptic neurites were found in the inner spiral bundle, they failed to reach IHC basal lateral poles to form contacts (17 out of 23 in RTN4RL2<sup>-/-</sup> animals). This result might provide a plausible explanation for the “orphan” Homer1 puncta shown by immunohistochemistry in RTN4RL2<sup>-/-</sup> organs of Corti. Note that the presence of non-synaptic neurites in the RTN4RL2<sup>-/-</sup> animal was not associated with a profound reduction in ribbon synapses (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>, Figure 2-figure supplement 2B, Figure 3-figure supplement 1A), suggesting a different scenario than deafferentation due to excitotoxic synaptopathy as recently reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Moverman et al., 2023</xref>).

<title>Deletion of RTN4RL2 results in depolarized shift of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel activation in IHCs</title>
<p>Next, we tested for potential effects of RTN4RL2 deletion on the presynaptic IHC function. We performed whole-cell patch-clamp recordings from IHCs of p21-29 RTN4RL2<sup>+/+</sup> and RTN4RL2<sup>-/-</sup> mice. First, we recorded voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> currents by applying step depolarizations with 5 mV increment in ruptured patch-clamp configuration (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>, see Materials and Methods). We did not observe any change in the maximal Ca<sup>2+</sup> current amplitude (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>, C), yet noticed small (∼ +3 mV) but consistent and statistically significant depolarized shift of the voltage of half-maximal Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel activation (V<sub>half</sub>; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>, E). The voltage sensitivity of the channels was not changed in RTN4RL2<sup>-/-</sup> IHCs (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>). Next, we probed Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx triggered exocytosis from IHCs by applying depolarizations of varying durations to voltages saturating Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx in IHCs of both genotypes (-17 mV) and recording exocytic membrane capacitance changes (ΔC<sub>m</sub>) in the perforated patch-clamp configuration (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4G</xref>).

<p>We then turned to study single AZ function by combining whole cell ruptured patch-clamp combined with spinning disc confocal imaging of presynaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx, as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Ohn et al., 2016</xref>). TAMRA conjugated Ctbp2 binding dimeric peptide and the low affinity Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator Fluo4-FF (k<sub>D</sub>: 10 µM) were loaded into the cell via the patch pipette and Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx at single AZs was visualized in the form of hotspots by applying voltage ramp depolarizations to the IHCs and simultaneously imaging Fluo4-FF fluorescence near labeled ribbons (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>, see Materials and methods). Maximal Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx at single AZs tended to be higher in IHCs of RTN4RL2<sup>-/-</sup> mice but the difference did not reach statistical significance (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>, B<sup>i</sup>). The V<sub>half</sub> of Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel clusters at single AZs showed depolarized shift (∼ +5 mV), which was statistically significant despite the large variability of V<sub>half</sub> across different AZs (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>, C<sup>i</sup>). Furthermore, we did not observe any mismatch in Ctbp2 positive puncta and evoked Ca<sup>2+</sup> hotspots, indicating the correct localization of Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels at the AZs. We verified this by performing immunostainings of Ca<sub>v</sub>1.3, Ctbp2 and Bassoon and did not detect any apparent misalignment of these protein clusters (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>). In summary, deletion of RTN4RL2 causes a depolarized shift of the activation of presynaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx in IHCs as demonstrated at the single AZ and whole cell levels. This is expected to elevate the sound pressure levels required to reach a comparable activity of synaptic transmission for sound encoding and predicts elevated auditory thresholds which we tested by recordings of auditory brainstem responses.</p>

<title>RTN4RL2 is essential for normal hearing</title>
<p>In order to evaluate auditory systems function in RTN4RL2<sup>-/-</sup> mice, we recorded auditory brainstem responses (ABRs) at the age of 2-4 months. ABRs were elicited in response to 4, 8, 16, 32 kHz tone bursts and click stimuli of increasing sound pressure levels. We determined the sound thresholds by identifying the lowest sound pressure level which resulted in detectable ABR waveform. We found ABR thresholds to be significantly increased by around 30-45 dB across all the tested frequencies and in response to the click stimulations in RTN4RL2<sup>-/-</sup> mice compared to the wild-type controls (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we investigated the role of the Nogo/RTN4 receptor homolog RTN4RL2 in the cochlea. Consistent with the previous reports, we detected RTN4RL2 expression in IHCs and SGNs. Upon RTN4RL2 deletion, we observed alterations of the IHC-SGN synapses (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>). Presynaptically, Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel activation was shifted towards depolarized voltages and ribbon size was enlarged. IHC exocytosis was unaltered when probed at saturating depolarizations. At the postsynaptic side, PSDs juxtaposing presynaptic ribbons were smaller compared to the controls and seemed to be deficient of GluA2/3, despite the expression of Gria2 mRNA in RTN4RL2<sup>-/-</sup> SGNs. Additionally, we observed PSDs which resided further from the IHC membrane and did not juxtapose the presynaptic AZs in RTN4RL2<sup>-/-</sup> mice. These PSDs potentially belong to the type I SGN neurites that ended in the inner spiral bundle without contacting the IHCs, as observed in SBEM reconstructions of RTN4RL2<sup>-/-</sup> SGNs. Finally, ABR thresholds were elevated in RTN4RL2<sup>-/-</sup> mice indicating that RTN4RL2 is required for normal hearing.</p>

<p>RTN4 receptors have been implicated as presynaptic adhesion molecules based on their transsynaptic interactions with postsynaptically enriched brain-specific angiotensin inhibitor (BAI) adhesion GPCRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Stephenson et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Wang et al., 2021</xref>). Despite this, at least RTN4R has been proposed to function postsynaptically, given that its knockdown leads primarily to postsynaptic changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Wills et al., 2012</xref>). The interpretation of RTN4R function and localization is further complicated by their enrichment in both pre- and postsynaptic terminals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Wang et al., 2002b</xref>). Similarly, we observed RTN4RL2 expression in both IHCs and SGNs. Interestingly, a recent study described a hearing impairment in BAI1 deficient mice and suggested that postsynaptically functioning BAI1 is important for correct localization of AMPA receptor subunits in spiral ganglion neurons based on the absence or decrease of different AMPA receptor subunits at the SGN postsynapses in BAI1 deficient mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Carlton et al., 2024</xref>). Similarly, our data from RTN4RL2<sup>-/-</sup> mice show the absense of GluA2/3 positive puncta juxtaposing presynaptic AZs. Along with the evidence for transsynaptic interaction between RTN4Rs and BAIs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Wang et al., 2021</xref>), this raises the possibility that the GluA2/3 AMPA receptor subunit localization to SGN PSDs requires the interaction of presynaptic RTN4RL2 and postsynaptic BAI1. Likewise, the changes of presynaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel properties and ribbons in IHCs could result from direct presynaptic action of RTN4RL2. However, further experiments, e.g. in mutants with SGN-specific RTN4RL2 deletion should evaluate a potential direct postsynaptic role of RTN4RL2 including a possible transsynaptic signaling to IHC AZs. Presynaptic changes upon postsynaptic manipulation have been reported previously. For instance, the deletion of postsynaptically expressed Pou4f1 transcription factor resulted in hyperpolarized shift of IHC Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels, as well as in changes of the presynaptic heterogeneity of IHC AZs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Sherrill et al., 2019</xref>). Similarly, presynaptic ribbon sizes were altered in IHCs of mice, which exhibited conditional deletion of Runx1 transcription factor from SGNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Shrestha et al., 2023</xref>).</p>
<p>We did not detect RTN4RL2 near the synaptic regions but cannot exclude transient synaptic localization of RTN4RL2 during development. Indeed, localization of RTN4Rs has been shown to be dynamically regulated across different phases of IPSC-derived neuron development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Wang et al., 2021</xref>). We propose that the afferent synaptic changes contribute to the severe hearing impairment in RTN4RL2<sup>-/-</sup> mice. The phenotype of increased ABR thresholds could partially be explained by the depolarized activation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels in IHCs. As it has been shown, the apparent Ca<sup>2+</sup> dependence of glutamate release from IHCs on average follows a near linear relationship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Wong et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Özçete and Moser, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Jaime Tobón and Moser, 2023b</xref>, 2023a). Therefore, due to the depolarized shift of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel activation, the glutamate release from IHCs and subsequent spike generation in SGNs would require stronger stimuli. Likewise, depolarized activation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels has been associated with the higher firing thresholds and low spontaneous rates in SGNs of Ribeye knock-out mice, albeit less severe hearing phenotype was observed in those mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Jean et al., 2018</xref>).</p>
<p>In addition or alternatively, the increase in auditory thresholds could be caused by the deficiency of GluA2/3 AMPA receptors of the SGN postsynapses in RTN4RL2<sup>-/-</sup> mice. We cannot exclude that the lack of GluA2/3 subunits can be compensated by the overexpression of GluA4 subunit, which was also recently shown in GluA3 KO mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Rutherford et al., 2023</xref>). Given the observed synaptic changes, it seems less likely that the hearing impairment would have resulted from the intrinsic changes of SGN firing. Further experiments, where SGNs would be stimulated directly via <italic>ex vivo</italic> patch-clamp or optogenetically could help to probe for functional deficits in SGN of RTN4RL2<sup>-/-</sup> mice. Another interesting observation was the additional PSDs not juxtaposing presynaptic ribbons that were detected around IHCs of RTN4RL2<sup>-/-</sup> mice. These “orphan” PSDs seem not to be part of the efferent synapses formed between LOC/MOCs and SGNs as we verified by simultaneous anti-Homer1 and anti-synapsin immunolabelings. To check the SGN connectivity we performed SBEM in RTN4RL2<sup>+/+</sup> and RTN4RL2<sup>-/-</sup> cochlear samples and observed a high percentage of non-synaptic SGN neurites in the reconstructed neurons of inner spiral bundles in RTN4RL2<sup>-/-</sup> samples. A sizable subset of the non-synaptic SGN boutons did not make a contact with IHCs, potentially housing the “orphan” PSDs observed around the IHCs in our immunolabeled samples. How exactly those non-synaptic neurites appear remains to be investigated. SGN neurite retraction from IHCs has been demonstrated in noise-exposed animals, followed by the degeneration of the SGN somata and axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Kujawa and Liberman, 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Moverman et al., 2023</xref>). This process however results in up to 50% degeneration of the ribbon synapses. Interestingly, in RTN4RL2<sup>-/-</sup> mice the number of the ribbon synapses as well as the density of the SGN somata was largely intact. This indicates that the non-synaptic neurites do not result from synaptic loss as found in hereditary or acquired synaptopathy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Roux et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Ruel et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Seal et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Kujawa and Liberman, 2009</xref>). Although it is plausible that the non-synaptic SGN neurites may fail to reach the IHCs during initial development, it is unlikely that this would selectively impact only a subset of neurons and still allow the Homer1-positive patches to develop in the absence of presynaptic components. Alternatively, it is known that major synaptic pruning takes place in developing SGNs, whereby up to 50% of the synapses are lost between the IHCs and the SGNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Defourny et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Coate et al., 2019</xref>), suggesting, that the non-synaptic SGN neurites of RTN4RL2<sup>-/-</sup> mice could be a result of failed pruning of SGNs during the development. Yet how this would then comply with normal synapse and SGN counts remains to be elucidated. Future studies will be required to quantify the type I SGN projections of RTN4RL2<sup>-/-</sup> mice during development and to trace their neurites from the soma to the organ of Corti to probe for potential branching in the spiral lamina.</p>
<p>Future work will be required to identify the RTN4RL2 ligands in the cochlea. To this date, the interaction partners of RTN4Rs are not very well understood. While RTN4R in-trans interactions include NogoA, MAG, OMgp, chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans, the only well established ligand for RTN4RL2 remains MAG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Fournier et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Domeniconi et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Wang et al., 2002a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Venkatesh et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Schwab, 2010</xref>). Other attractive candidate ligands for RTN4Rs are the BAIs. BAI-RTN4R interaction has been suggested to mediate dendritic arborization, axonal elongation, synapse formation in IPSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Wang et al., 2021</xref>) and, in the case of this study GluA2/3 AMPA receptor subunit localization to the SGN postsynaptic densities. Finally, RTN4RL2 has been proposed to interact with chondroitin-sulfate proteoglycan Versican to control the amount of skin innervation by DRG neurites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Bäumer et al., 2014</xref>). While to our knowledge, attempts have yet to be made for detecting Versican signal around the IHCs, other extracellular matrix proteins such as aggrecan, brevican, Tenascin-R, Tenascin-C, hyaluron and proteoglycan link proteins 1 and 4 have been shown to form dense, basket-like structures that surround the base of the IHCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Kwiatkowska et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Sonntag et al., 2018</xref>). Furthermore, deletion of brevican results in alteration of pre- and postsynaptic spatial coupling at IHC synapses, indicating the possible role of extracellular matrix in transsynaptic organization. However, while the existing observations suggest that the synaptic changes in RTN4RL2 deficient animals might reflect derailed interaction of the SGN neurites with the extracellular matrix, the relevance of such an interaction of RTN4RL2 and Versican in the cochlea needs to be addressed in the future.</p>

<title>Patch-clamp recordings</title>
<p>The apical turn of the organ of Corti was dissected from p21 to p29 animals in HEPES Hanks solution containing (in mM): 5.36 KCl, 141.7 NaCl, 10 HEPES, 0.5 MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 1 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 5.6 D-glucose, and 3.4 L-glutamine (pH 7.2, ∼ 300 mOsm/l). IHCs were exposed by gently removing of nearby supporting cells by negative pressure through a glass pipette from either modiolar or pillar side. All experiments were conducted at room temperature (RT, 20–25°C). Patch pipettes were made from GB150-8P or GB150F-8P borosilicate glass capillaries (Science Products, Hofheim, Germany) for perforated and ruptured patch-clamp configurations, respectively. Pipettes were fire polished with a custom-made microforge and coated with Sylgard to minimize the capacitive noise, whenever capacitance recordings were performed. The measurements were performed using EPC-10 amplifier controlled by Patchmaster software (HEKA Elektronik, Germany). The holding potential for IHCs was set to -87 mV across all the experiments.</p>

<title>Ruptured patch-clamp</title>
<p>For ruptured patch-clamp we used extracellular solution containing (in mM): 2.8 KCl, 105 NaCl, 10 HEPES, 1 CsCl, 1 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 5 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 35 TEA-Cl, and 2 mg/ml D-glucose (pH 7.2, ∼ 300 mOsm/l).

Additionally, Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator Fluo4-FF (0.8 mM, Life Technologies) and TAMRA-conjugated RIBEYE/Ctbp2 binding peptide (10 mM, synthetized by the group of Dr. Olaf Jahn, Göttingen) were added to the intracellular solution for live imaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Zenisek et al., 2004</xref>). Voltage dependency of Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx was recorded by applying 20 ms long step deploarizations with 5 mV increment. For Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging, voltage ramp depolarizations ranging from -87 mV to 63 mV in the course of 150 ms were applied to the cells. Leak correction was performed using P/n protocol and liquid junction potential of 17 mV was corrected offline. Recordings were discarded from the analysis if the series resistance (R<sub>s</sub>) exceeded 14 MOhm during the first 3 minutes after rupturing the cell, leak current exceeded -50 pA at the holding potential and Ca<sup>2+</sup> current rundown was more than 25%.</p>
<p>Recordings were analyzed using Igor Pro 6.3 (Wavemetrics) custom-written programs.

Perforated patch-clamp recordings from IHCs was described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Moser and Beutner, 2000</xref>). C<sub>m</sub> changes were measured using Lindau-Neher technique (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Lindau and Neher, 1988</xref>). To evoke exocytosis IHCs were stimulated by step depolarizations (to -17 mV) of different durations (2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100 ms) in randomized manner. Currents were leak-corrected using a p/5 protocol. Recordings were used only if the leak current was lower than 30 pA and the R<sub>s</sub> was lower than 30 MOhm. Recordings were analyzed using Igor Pro 6.3 (Wavemetrics) custom-written programs. Ca<sup>2+</sup> charge (Q<sub>Ca</sub><sup>2+</sup>) was calculated by the time integral of the leak-subtracted Ca<sup>2+</sup> current during the depolarization step.

<title>Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging</title>
<p>Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging was performed using spinning disc confocal microscope, as described before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Ohn et al., 2016</xref>). Briefly, the set-up was equipped with a spinning disc confocal unit (CSU22, Yokogawa) mounted on an upright microscope (Axio Examiner, Zeiss) and scientific CMOS camera (Andor Neo). Images were acquired using 63x, 1.0 NA objective (W Plan-Apochromat, Zeiss). The pixel size was measured to be 103 nm.</p>
<p>IHCs were loaded with Fluo4-FF Ca<sup>2+</sup> dye and TAMRA-conjugated Ctbp2 binding dimeric peptide via the patch pipette. First, the cells were scanned from bottom to top by imaging TAMRA fluorescence with 561 nm laser (Jive, Cobolt AB) and exposing each plane for 0.5 seconds. The stack was acquired with 0.5 μm step size using Piezo positioner (Piezosystem). This allowed us to identify the planes containing synaptic ribbons. Next, we recorded Fluo4-FF fluorescence increase at individual synapses by imaging ribbon containing planes with 491 nm laser (Calypso, Cobolt AB) at 100 Hz while applying voltage ramp depolarizations to the cell. 2 voltage ramps were applied at each plane, one being 5 ms shifted relative to the other. Spinning disk rotation speed was set to 2000 rpm, in order to synchronize with Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging. Images were analyzed using Igor Pro 6.3 (Wavemetrics). Ca<sup>2+</sup> hotspots were identified by subtracting the average signal of several baseline frames from the average signal of 5 frames during stimulation (ΔF image). Since the same Ca<sup>2+</sup> hotspot appears across multiple planes, the plane exhibiting the strongest signal was chosen. The intensities of the 3x3 matrix surrounding the central pixel of the hotspot were averaged across all time points to obtain the intensity profiles of Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx over time. Afterwards, the background signal (average of approximately 60x60 pixel intensities outside the cell) was subtracted from the intensity-time profiles and ΔF/F<sub>0</sub> traces were calculated. To enhance voltage resolution of Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging, two ΔF/F<sub>0</sub> traces corresponding to two voltage ramp depolarizations (one shifted by 5 ms over the other) were combined and plotted against the corresponding voltages (FV curves). These curves were subsequently fitted with a modified Boltzmann function. Afterwards, fractional activation curves were calculated by fitting the linear decay of the fluorescence signal from the FV curves with a linear function (G<sub>max</sub>) and then dividing the FV fit by the G<sub>max</sub> line. The resulting curves were further fitted with a Boltzmann function. Maximal Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx (ΔF/F<sub>0</sub> <sub>max</sub>) was calculated by averaging 5 points during the stimulation.</p>

<p>Hearing and balance rely on specialized ribbon synapses that transmit sensory stimuli between hair cells and afferent neurons. Synaptic adhesion molecules that form and regulate transsynaptic interactions between inner hair cells (IHCs) and spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs) are crucial for maintaining auditory synaptic integrity and, consequently, for auditory signaling. Synaptic adhesion molecules such as neurexin-3 and neuroligin-1 and -3 have recently been shown to play vital roles in establishing and maintaining these synaptic connections ( doi: 10.1242/dev.202723 and DOI: 10.1016/j.isci.2022.104803). However, the full set of molecules required for synapse assembly remains unclear.</p>
<p>Karagulan et al. highlight the critical role of the synaptic adhesion molecule RTN4RL2 in the development and function of auditory afferent synapses between IHCs and SGNs, particularly regarding how RTN4RL2 may influence synaptic integrity and receptor localization. Their study shows that deletion of RTN4RL2 in mice leads to enlarged presynaptic ribbons and smaller postsynaptic densities (PSDs) in SGNs, indicating that RTN4RL2 is vital for synaptic structure. Additionally, the presence of &quot;orphan&quot; PSDs-those not directly associated with IHCs-in RTN4RL2 knockout mice suggests a developmental defect in which some SGN neurites fail to form appropriate synaptic contacts, highlighting potential issues in synaptic pruning or guidance. The study also observed a depolarized shift in the activation of CaV1.3 calcium channels in IHCs, indicating altered presynaptic functionality that may lead to impaired neurotransmitter release. Furthermore, postsynaptic SGNs exhibited a deficiency in GluA2/3 AMPA receptor subunits, despite normal Gria2 mRNA levels, pointing to a disruption in receptor localization that could compromise synaptic transmission. Auditory brainstem responses showed increased sound thresholds in RTN4RL2 knockout mice, indicating impaired hearing related to these synaptic dysfunctions.</p>
<p>The findings reported here significantly enhance our understanding of synaptic organization in the auditory system, particularly concerning the molecular mechanisms underlying IHC-SGN connectivity. The implications are far-reaching, as they not only inform auditory neuroscience but also provide insights into potential therapeutic targets for hearing loss related to synaptic dysfunction.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Kargulyan et al. investigate the function of the transsynaptic adhesion molecule RTN4RL2 in the formation and function of ribbon synapses between type I spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs) and inner hair cells. For this purpose, they study constitutive RTN4RL2 knock-out mice. Using immunohistochemistry, they reveal defects in the recruitment of protein to ribbon synapses in the knockouts. Serial block phase EM reveals defects in SGN projections in mutants. Electrophysiological recordings suggest a small but statistically significant depolarized shift in the activation of Cav1.3 Ca2+ channels. Auditory thresholds are also elevated in the mutant mice. The authors conclude that RTN4RL2 contributes to the formation and function of auditory afferent synapses to regulate auditory function.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors have excellent tools to analyze ribbon synapses.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>However, there are several concerns that substantially reduce my enthusiasm for the study.</p>
<p>(1) The analysis of the expression pattern of RTN4RL2 in Figure 1 is incomplete. The authors should show a developmental time course of expression up into maturity to correlate gene expression with major developmental milestones such as axon outgrowth, innervation, and refinement. This would allow the development of models supporting roles in axon outgrowth versus innervation or both.</p>
<p>(2) It would be important to improve the RNAscope data. Controls should be provided for Figure 1B to show that no signal is observed in hair cells from knockouts. The authors apparently already have the sections because they analyzed gene expression in SGNs of the knock-outs (Figure 1C).</p>
<p>(3) It is unclear from the immunolocalization data in Figure 1D if all type I SGNs express RTN4RL2. Quantification would be important to properly document the presence of RTN4RL2 in all or a subset of type I SGNs. If only a subset of SGNs express RTN4RL2, it could significantly affect the interpretation of the data. For example, SGNs selectively projecting to the pillar or modiolar side of hair cells could be affected. These synapses significantly differ in their properties.</p>
<p>(4) It is important to show proper controls for the RTN4RL2 immunolocalization data to show that no staining is observed in knockouts.</p>
<p>(5) The authors state in the discussion that no staining for RTN4RL2 was observed at synaptic sites. This is surprising. Did the authors stain multiple ages? Was there perhaps transient expression during development? Or in axons indicative of a role in outgrowth, not synapse formation?</p>
<p>(6) In Figure 2 it seems that images in mutants are brighter compared to wildtypes. Are exposure times equivalent? Is this a consistent result?</p>
<p>(7) The number of synaptic ribbons for wildtype in Figure 2 is at 10/IHCs, and in Figure 2 Supplementary Figure 2 at 20/IHCs (20 is more like what is normally reported in the literature). The value for mutant similarly drastically varies between the two figures. This is a significant concern, especially because most differences that are reported in synaptic parameters between wild-type and mutants are far below a 2-fold difference.</p>
<p>(8) The authors report differences in ribbon volume between wild-type and mutant. Was there a difference between the modiolar/pillar region of hair cells? It is known that synaptic size varies across the modiolar-pillar axis. Maybe smaller synapses are preferentially lost?</p>
<p>(9) The authors show in Figure 2 - Supplement 3 that GluA2/3 staining is absent in the mutants. Are GluA4 receptors upregulated? Otherwise, synaptic transmission should be abolished, which would be a dramatic phenotype. Antibodies are available to analyze GluA4 expression, the experiment is thus feasible. Did the authors carry out recordings from SGNs?</p>
<p>(10) The authors use SBEM to analyze SGN projections and synapses. The data suggest that a significant number of SGNs are not connected to IHCs. A reconstruction in Figure 3 shows hair cells and axons. It is not clear how the outline of hair cells was derived, but this should be indicated. Also, is this a defect in the formation of synapses and subsequent retraction of SGN projections? Or could RTN4RL2 mutants have a defect in axonal outgrowth and guidance that secondarily affects synapses? To address this question, it would be useful to sparsely label SGNs in mutants, for example with AAV vectors expression GFP, and to trace the axons during development. This would allow us to distinguish between models of RTN4RL2 function. As it stands, it is not clear that RTN4RL2 acts directly at synapses.</p>
<p>(11) The authors observe a tiny shift in the operation range of Ca2+ channels that has no effect on synaptic vesicle exocytosis. It seems very unlikely that this difference can explain the auditory phenotype of the mutant mice.</p>
<p>(12) ABR recordings were conducted in whole-body knockouts. Effects on auditory thresholds could be a secondary consequence of perturbation along the auditory pathway. Conditional knockouts or precisely designed rescue experiments would go a long way to support the authors' hypothesis. I realize that this is a big ask and floxed mice might not be available to conduct the study.</p>

<p>In this study, the authors used RNAscope and immunostaining to confirm the expression of RTN4RL2 RNA and protein in hair cells and spiral ganglia. Through RTN4RL2 gene knockout mice, they demonstrated that the absence of RTN4RL2 leads to an increase in the size of presynaptic ribbons and a depolarized shift in the activation of calcium channels in inner hair cells. Additionally, they observed a reduction in GluA2/3 AMPA receptors in postsynaptic neurons and identified additional &quot;orphan PSDs&quot; not paired with presynaptic ribbons. These synaptic alterations ultimately resulted in an increased hearing threshold in mice, confirming that the RTN4RL2 gene is essential for normal hearing. These data are intriguing as they suggest that RTN4RL2 contributes to the proper formation and function of auditory afferent synapses and is critical for normal hearing. However, a thorough understanding of the known or postulated roles of RTN4Rl2 is lacking.</p>
<p>While the conclusions of this paper are generally well supported by the data, several aspects of the data analysis warrant further clarification and expansion.</p>
<p>(1) A quantitative assessment is necessary in Figure 1 when discussing RNA and protein expression. It would be beneficial to show that expression levels are quantitatively reduced in KO mice compared to wild-type mice. This suggestion also applies to Figure 2-supplement 3.D, which examines expression levels.</p>
<p>(2) In Figure 2, the authors present a morphological analysis of synapses and discuss the presence of &quot;orphan PSDs.&quot; I agree that Homer1 not juxtaposed with Ctbp2 is increased in KO mice compared to the control group. However, in quantifying this, they opted to measure the number of Homer1 juxtaposed with Ctbp2 rather than directly quantifying the number of Homer1 not juxtaposed with Ctbp2. Quantifying the number of Homer1 not juxtaposed with Ctbp2 would more clearly represent &quot;orphan PSDs&quot; and provide stronger support for the discussion surrounding their presence.</p>
<p>(3) In Figure 2, Supplementary 3, the authors discuss GluA2/3 puncta reduction and note that Gria2 RNA expression remains unchanged. However, there is an issue with the lack of quantification for Gria2 RNA expression. Additionally, it is noted that RNA expression was measured at P4. While the timing for GluA2/3 puncta assessment is not specified, if it was assessed at 3 weeks old as in Figure 2's synaptic puncta analysis, it would be inappropriate to link Gria2 RNA expression with GluA2/3 protein expression at P4. If RNA and protein expression were assessed at P4, please indicate this timing for clarity.</p>
<p>(4) In Figure 3, the authors indicate that RTN4RL2 deficiency reduces the number of type 1 SGNs connected to ribbons. Given that the number of ribbons remains unchanged (Figure 2), it is important to clearly explain the implications of this finding. It is already known that each type I SGN forms a single synaptic contact with a single IHC. The fact that the number of ribbons remains constant while additional &quot;orphan PSDs&quot; are present suggests that the overall number of SGNs might need to increase to account for these findings. An explanation addressing this would be helpful.</p>
<p>(5) In Figure 4F and 5Cii, could you clarify how voltage sensitivity (k) was calculated? Additionally, please provide an explanation for the values presented in millivolts (mV).</p>
<p>(6) In Figure 6, the author measured the threshold of ABR at 2-4 months old. Since previous figures confirming synaptic morphology and function were all conducted on 3-week-old mice, it would be better to measure ABR at 3 weeks of age if possible.</p>
