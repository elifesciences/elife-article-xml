<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Neural stem cells (NSCs) possess the remarkable ability to self-renew for maintaining their identity and differentiate into diverse neural cell types required for neurogenesis during brain development. The self-renewal, differentiation, and proliferation of NSCs are regulated by both intrinsic programs inside stem cells and extrinsic cues from the surrounding niches. The mammalian NSC niche found in the neurogenic regions is composed of diverse cell types including choroid plexus, vascular endothelia cells, pericytes, microglia, and meninges, which regulate NSC behaviors such as proliferation, self-renewal, and differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Bjornsson, Apostolopoulou, Tian, &amp; Temple, 2015</xref>). The diversity and complexity of these cell populations confer niche the ability of integrating local and systemic signals, but make it complicated to study the interaction between niches and NSCs in mammals, which is a critical issue to understand neurogenesis and improve clinical applications of NSCs.</p>
<p><italic>Drosophila</italic> larval central nervous system (CNS), composed of central brain (CB), optic lobe (OL) and ventral nerve cord (VNC), is a simple but sophisticated model to decipher the regulatory mechanisms underlying NSC behaviors mediated by niche signals. In this system, <italic>Drosophila</italic> NSCs, called neuroblasts (NBs), and their progenies are encased by a variety of glial cells including perineurial glia, subperineurial glia, cortex glia, astrocyte-like glia and ensheathing glia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Hartenstein, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Ito, Urban, &amp; Technau, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Pereanu, Shy, &amp; Hartenstein, 2005</xref>). These glial cells not only form the physical support structure for NBs, but also provide extrinsic cues that regulate NB reactivation, survival, and proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Read, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Speder &amp; Brand, 2014</xref>). However, it remains elusive whether the glial-cell-forming niche is involved in the regulation of the prominent characteristics of NBs, self-renewal and differentiation.</p>
<p>Iron is a vital micronutrient for almost all living organisms since it participates in many crucial biological processes, including mitochondrial electron transport and cellular respiration that both support ATP production used for most cellular activities. High levels of iron are found in many organs including the brain, where iron is required for myelination and formation of neuronal dendritic trees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Lozoff et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Moller et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Rice &amp; Barone, 2000</xref>). Iron deficiency in infants and early childhood has been well documented to be associated with long-term cognitive, social, and emotional problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Fretham, Carlson, &amp; Georgieff, 2011</xref>). Thus, it is intriguing to investigate whether iron is also required in NSCs during neurogenesis.</p>
<p>Ferritin, a ubiquitous protein present in most organisms, is composed of 24 subunits that assemble into a hollow-sphere complex capable of storing up to 4,500 iron atoms in a bioavailable form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Andrews, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Knovich, Storey, Coffman, Torti, &amp; Torti, 2009</xref>). Ferritin in both mammal and insect is a heteropolymer, consisting of heavy and light chain homologue subunits. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, these subunits are encoded by <italic>ferritin 1 heavy chain homologue</italic> (<italic>Fer1HCH</italic>) and <italic>ferritin 2 light chain homologue</italic> (<italic>Fer2LCH</italic>) respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Arosio, Ingrassia, &amp; Cavadini, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Pham &amp; Winzerling, 2010</xref>), which both contain secretion signal peptides that direct them to the ER during translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Lind, Ekengren, Melefors, &amp; Soderhall, 1998</xref>). Consequently, <italic>Drosophila</italic> ferritin is confined to the secretory pathway, abundant in the hemolymph, and absent from the cytosol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Nichol, Law, &amp; Winzerling, 2002</xref>). Previous researches have shown that <italic>Drosophila</italic> ferritin not only directly participates in dietary iron absorption by removing iron from enterocytes across the basolateral membrane, but competes with transferrin to deliver iron between the gut and the fat body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Tang &amp; Zhou, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Xiao, Liu, Zhao, Wang, &amp; Zhou, 2019</xref>). These findings underscore the pivotal role of ferritin in iron transport. Interestingly, iron-loaded ferritin, serving as an essential mitogen, promotes proliferation of cultured <italic>Drosophila</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Li, 2010</xref>). Therefore, it is tempting to investigate whether ferritin is required for self-renewal and proliferation of NSCs during brain development.</p>
<p>Here we show that glial ferritin supplies iron into NBs to form iron-sulfur (Fe-S) clusters, which is necessary for the production of ATP, providing the energy required for self-renewal and proliferation of NBs, highlighting ferritin as a potential target for suppressing tumor.</p>

<title>Glial ferritin is required for NB maintenance and proliferation</title>
<p>To identify new niche factors involved in the balance between NB self-renewal and differentiation, we used <italic>repo-GAL4</italic> to perform an RNAi mediated screen in glial cells. <italic>Fer1HCH</italic> and <italic>Fer2LCH</italic>, two ferritin subunit encoding genes, were identified to be essential for NB maintenance and brain development. Specifically, knocking down <italic>Fer1HCH</italic> or <italic>Fer2LCH</italic> in glial cells significantly reduced the number of NBs in the CB and VNC at the third-instar larval stage, which resulted in decreased size of the CNS (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">B</xref> and <xref rid="fig1s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1-figure supplement 1A</xref></bold>). To further assess the impact on NB proliferation, we employed the mitotic marker phosphohistone H3 (PH3) and the thymidine analogue 5-ethynyl-2â-deoxyuridine (EdU), revealing a substantial decrease in the proliferation rate of NBs upon glial ferritin knockdown (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A and C</xref> and <xref rid="fig1s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1-figure supplement 1B</xref> and <xref rid="fig1s1" ref-type="fig">C</xref></bold>). These results indicated that glial ferritin is required for maintaining NBs and their proliferation.</p>

<p>To identify the glial subpopulation in which ferritin functions, we employed subtype-restricted GAL4 to perform ferritin knockdowns (<bold><xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref></bold>). We observed that knocking down ferritin genes in cortex glia led to a similar yet milder phenotype compared to that observed in the pan-glia knockdown (<bold><xref rid="fig1s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1-figure supplement 1D</xref></bold>). This milder effect may be attributed to potential compensatory mechanisms from other glial subpopulations. Interestingly, knocking down ferritin in other glial subtypes did not yield any discernible phenotype. These findings suggest that ferritin functions collectively across all glial populations to regulate the activity of NBs.</p>

<p>We confirmed the phenotype with multiple independent RNAi lines for <italic>Fer1HCH</italic> or <italic>Fer2LCH</italic>, and observed similar abnormalities of larval NBs and brain development (<bold><xref rid="fig1s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 1-figure supplement 2A</xref></bold>). Hereafter, <italic>UAS-Fer1HCH-RNAi</italic> (THU5585) and <italic>UAS-Fer2LCH-RNAi</italic> (TH01861.N) were used for most studies, and we only quantified NB number and proliferation rate in the CB for convenience in this research.</p>
<p>To evaluate the efficiency of RNAi for <italic>Fer1HCH</italic> or <italic>Fer2LCH</italic>, RT-PCR was performed with total RNA isolated from whole brain dissected from third-instar larvae. The abundance of <italic>Fer1HCH</italic> or <italic>Fer2LCH</italic> mRNA was significantly reduced in glial <italic>Fer1HCH</italic> or <italic>Fer2LCH</italic> knockdown respectively (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D and E</xref></bold>). Western blot analysis of larval brain protein extract using polyclonal antibodies against Fer1HCH or Fer2LCH further confirmed that both subunits were down-regulated in glial knockdown of either subunit (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F-I</xref></bold>), consistent with previous research in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Missirlis et al., 2007</xref>). To exclude the possibility of RNAi off-target effects, we used <italic>repo-GAL4</italic> to overexpress RNAi-resistant <italic>Fer1HCH</italic> (or <italic>Fer2LCH</italic>) containing silent mutations in the region targeted by shRNA, which resulted in a significant increase in the number and proliferation rate of NBs compared to glial ferritin knockdown alone (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1J-L</xref> and <xref rid="fig1s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 1-figure supplement 2B, C</xref></bold>). Additionally, similar but weaker phenotypes were observed when Fer1HCH<sup>DN</sup>, a ferroxidase-inactive form of Fer1HCH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Missirlis et al., 2007</xref>), was overexpressed in glial cells (<bold><xref rid="fig1s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 1-figure supplement 2D</xref></bold>). These results support the conclusion that ferritin in glial cells is essential for the maintenance and proliferation of NBs, suggesting that iron homeostasis is involved in this process.</p>

<title>Ferritin is produced mainly in glial cells and secreted into NBs through a vesicle-dependent pathway</title>
<p>To investigate the role of iron homeostasis in <italic>Drosophila</italic> CNS, we tried to knock down genes involved in iron transport, storage, and regulation in NBs, neurons, and glial cells, respectively. Interestingly, only glial knockdown of ferritin-related genes led to NB loss and defective brain development. It appears that ferritin generated in glial cells is the only crucial protein for regulating the behavior of NBs and, ultimately, the larval brain development. To recapitulate the endogenous ferritin expression pattern, we took advantage of a Fer1HCH/Fer2LCH enhancer trapped GAL4 line to drive a variant of DsRed protein with a nuclear localization signal (DsRed Stinger). Surprisingly, our immunostaining experiments revealed that most, if not all, DsRed was co-localized with the glia nuclear protein Repo, instead of the NB nuclear protein Dpn (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref></bold>). These results further confirm that glial cells are the main producers of ferritin in the larval brain.</p>

<p><italic>Fer1HCH<sup>G188</sup></italic> encodes a GFP-tagged Fer1HCH subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Missirlis et al., 2007</xref>), which labels the distribution of Fer1HCH, representing the pattern of ferritin. As shown in the <bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref></bold>, ferritin was detected in NBs besides glial cells, despite that ferritin is specifically produced in glial cells. To explore the possibility of ferritin transfer from glial cells to NBs, we observed the GFP signal of <italic>Fer1HCH<sup>G188</sup></italic> with glial ferritin knockdown, and found that GFP in the brain was almost completely depleted (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref></bold>). Furthermore, we used <italic>repo-GAL4</italic> to drive the expression of GFP-tagged Fer1HCH and mCherry-tagged Fer2LCH in glial cells. We observed that both Fer1HCH::GFP and Fer2LCH::mCherry were present in NBs, while the control GFP and mCherry were restricted to glial cells (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref></bold>). Altogether, we conclude that ferritin is generated in glial cells and then transferred to NBs in the larval brain.</p>
<p>In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, both ferritin subunits contain secretion signal peptides that direct protein to the endoplasmic reticulum during translation, which allows the ferritin to be transported out of the cell. To investigate whether the ferritin was transported from glia to NBs via the vesicular transport, we expressed a temperature-sensitive dominant-negative Shibire dynamin protein (shi<sup>ts</sup>) to block vesicle trafficking from glial cells, and found that Fer1HCH::GFP accumulated in glia, accompanying with significantly diminished Fer1HCH signal in NBs (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D and E</xref></bold>), suggesting glial ferritin secretes into NBs through vesicle system.</p>

<title>Glial ferritin defects lead to iron deficiency in NBs</title>
<p>Given that ferritin is required for iron storage as well as delivery, glial ferritin knockdown might increase free iron level, leading to glial iron overload. Alternatively, it will block the iron transport from glia to NBs, resulting in NB iron deficiency. To determine the underlying cause of the brain development defects observed upon glial ferritin knockdown, we used iron chelator or ferric ammonium citrate (FAC) to manipulate iron intake and detect how it will influence NBs. We observed that depriving iron intake by adding iron chelator bathophenanthrolinedisulfonic acid disodium (BPS) to the food led to a dramatic decrease in the number and proliferation rate of NBs, compared to control larvae on normal food (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref></bold>). In line with this result, blocking iron absorption by knocking down intestinal ferritin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Tang &amp; Zhou, 2013</xref>) resulted in the similar defects of brain (<bold><xref rid="fig3s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 3-figure supplement 1A-C</xref></bold>). However, supplementing the diet with FAC did not induce any observable defects (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref></bold>). We also tested another iron chelator deferiprone (DFP), and found that DFP alone did not cause any brain defects in wild-type (WT) larvae, but it significantly exacerbated the effect of glial ferritin knockdown on defective NB maintenance (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B and C</xref></bold>). Furthermore, we attempted to rescue the brain defects observed in glial ferritin knockdown by providing dietary FAC, but the effect was negligible (<bold><xref rid="fig3s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 3-figure supplement 1D</xref> and <xref rid="fig3s1" ref-type="fig">E</xref></bold>). This may be due to the possibility that the knockdown of glial ferritin largely, if not completely, prevented the transport of iron from glia to NBs, which hindered the additional iron from entering NBs. These results indicate that the NB loss phenotype induced by glial ferritin knockdown is primarily due to iron deficiency in NBs.</p>

Specifically, knockdown of <italic>Zip13</italic> leads to failure of iron loading in secretory vesicles and consequently defective iron efflux (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Xiao et al., 2014</xref>). To investigate whether the NB loss phenotype of glial ferritin knockdown is caused by defective iron transport, we next sought to identify the role of Zip13 in the larval brain. Firstly, we examined the expression pattern of Zip13 and found that, similar to ferritin, the DsRed stinger driven by <italic>Zip13-GAL4</italic> was co-localized with Repo in glial cells rather than Dpn in NBs (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref></bold>). Subsequently, we knocked down <italic>Zip13</italic> in glial cells and observed a similar but weaker phenotype with the slightly reduced NB number and proliferation rate (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E-G</xref></bold>). Consistently, the defective brain development was confirmed in <italic>Zip13</italic> mutant (<bold><xref rid="fig3s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 3-figure supplement 1F-H</xref></bold>). Moreover, the effect of double knockdown of both <italic>Zip13</italic> and <italic>Fer2LCH</italic> was much more severe than that of either single knockdown, with a significant reduction in NB number and proliferation rate (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E-G</xref></bold>). Furthermore, we found that the reduced proliferation rate caused by <italic>Zip13</italic> knockdown could be partially rescued by iron supplementation in the food (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3H and I</xref></bold>). Overall, these results suggest that glial ferritin collaborates with Zip13 to deliver iron from glia to NBs.</p>
<p>Since previous studies have demonstrated the essential role of glial cells in NB survival and proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bailey et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Read, 2018</xref>), it is possible that iron overload in glial cells up-regulated the level of reactive oxygen species (ROS), leading to apoptosis of glial cells, which ultimately resulted in the loss of NBs. To rule out this possibility, firstly, we examined the ROS level of glial ferritin knockdown via a transgenic reporter GstD-GFP for oxidative stress signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Sykiotis &amp; Bohmann, 2008</xref>), and found an obvious increase as expected (<bold><xref rid="fig3s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 3-figure supplement 2A</xref> and <xref rid="fig3s2" ref-type="fig">B</xref></bold>). However, overexpressing anti-oxidant genes in glial cells or NBs did not restore the NB number and proliferation (<bold><xref rid="fig3s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 3-figure supplement 2C</xref> and <xref rid="fig3s2" ref-type="fig">D</xref></bold>). ROS accumulation leads to lipid peroxidation, which in turn results in ferroptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Hirschhorn &amp; Stockwell, 2019</xref>). Mitochondria in cells undergoing ferroptosis typically exhibit a characteristic shrinkage and damage, while the nuclei remain structurally intact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Mumbauer, Pascual, Kolotuev, &amp; Hamaratoglu, 2019</xref>). In order to investigate whether the NB loss is due to ferroptosis, we examined the mitochondrial morphology using Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM). However, our observation revealed no discernible defects in the mitochondria of NBs after glial ferritin knockdown (<bold><xref rid="fig3s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 3-figure supplement 2E</xref> and <xref rid="fig3s2" ref-type="fig">F</xref></bold>). Taken with the findings from iron chelator feeding together, we conclude that NB loss resulting from glial ferritin knockdown is not a consequence of ferroptosis. Secondly, we examined the apoptosis in glial cells via Caspase-3 or TUNEL staining, and found the apoptotic signal remained unchanged after glial ferritin knockdown (<bold><xref rid="fig3s3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3-figure supplement 3A-D</xref></bold>). Furthermore, we overexpressed the baculovirus protein P35 to inhibit apoptosis in glial cells, but failed to restore the lost NBs (<bold><xref rid="fig3s3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3-figure supplement 3E</xref></bold>). Given that glial morphology is important for NB lineages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Speder &amp; Brand, 2018</xref>), we used GFP driven by <italic>repo-GAL4</italic> to denote glia cells and found that glial chamber was almost intact after glial ferritin knockdown (<bold><xref rid="fig3s3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3-figure supplement 3F</xref></bold>). Together, we conclude that it is iron deficiency in NBs, rather than iron overload in glial cells, that leads to NB loss induced by ferritin defects.</p>

<title>Glial ferritin defects result in impaired Fe-S cluster activity and ATP production</title>
<p>To further prove that defective iron transport leads to the iron deficiency in NBs, we examined the iron availability by measuring aconitase activity in the brain. The activity of aconitase is sensitive to the level of Fe-S synthesis, so it can serve as an indicator for the availability of iron in the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Haile et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Tong &amp; Rouault, 2006</xref>). As shown in the <bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref></bold>, aconitase activity of ferritin knockdown diminished significantly, indicating that the availability of iron in the brain was reduced. This result also implies Fe-S clusters in NBs are probably deficient when knocking down ferritin in glia. Fe-S clusters are essential to activate the aconitase that converts citrate into isocitrate in the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA cycle) in mitochondria, and are one type of critical electron carrier for electron transport chain (ETC), especially for the Complex I, II and III function. Considering that TCA cycle and ETC are critical biological processes for ATP production, we proposed that knockdown of glial ferritin might lead to ATP deficiency due to the block of TCA cycle and ETC, which resulted in the failure of maintaining NBs and their proliferation. To verify this hypothesis, we first assessed the function of Fe-S clusters in NBs by knocking down the components of the cytosolic iron-sulfur protein assembly (CIA) complex. After knocking down the CIA component <italic>CG17683</italic>, <italic>galla2</italic>, and <italic>ciao1</italic> in NBs respectively, the proliferation level of NBs decreased significantly and brain size became smaller (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B and C</xref></bold>), which phenocopied the knockdown of <italic>Fer1HCH</italic> or <italic>Fer2LCH</italic> in glia. This result implies that Fe-S clusters are indispensable for NBs to maintain their proliferation.</p>

<p>To identify the biological processes related to Fe-S clusters in NB lineages, we performed transcriptome analysis of sorted NB lineages from glial ferritin knockdown as well as the control groups. We used NB driver <italic>Insc-GAL4</italic> to express <italic>UAS-DsRed</italic>, labeling NB lineages, and then sorted these cells via fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref></bold>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Harzer, Berger, Conder, Schmauss, &amp; Knoblich, 2013</xref>). We found that thousands of genes were significantly altered in the <italic>Fer1HCH</italic> and <italic>Fer2LCH</italic> knockdown groups compared to the control group. Specifically, 880 genes were simultaneously downregulated among the significantly changed genes in both the <italic>Fer1HCH</italic> and <italic>Fer2LCH</italic> knockdown groups contrasted to the control group (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref></bold>). Given that iron deficiency in NBs probably leads to the defects of energy production and biosynthesis, we performed gene enrichment analysis in these genes based on Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG). GO term analysis showed that mitochondrial organization, translation, transport, oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos), and ETC were enriched in the Biological Processes (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref></bold>), indicating NB mitochondrial functions including OxPhos and ETC were abnormal after glial ferritin knockdown. Moreover, NADH dehydrogenase and ribosome related terms were also enriched whether in the Cellular Component or Molecular Function (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref></bold>), suggesting that NADH dehydrogenase and biosynthesis were defective. Further, we validated the enriched term associated with mitochondrial function by qRT-PCR (<bold><xref rid="fig4s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 4-figure supplement 1A</xref></bold>). And the enriched KEGG pathways included OxPhos and ribosome (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4G</xref></bold>), aligning with the GO enrichment results and supporting the hypothesis that glial ferritin knockdown disrupted mitochondrial function including OxPhos and ETC as well as further biosynthesis.</p>
<p>To confirm whether the function of NADH dehydrogenase was disrupted, we used the SoNar that could bind to NAD<sup>+</sup> with specific conformation and excitatory wavelength to monitor the NAD<sup>+</sup> level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bonnay et al., 2020</xref>). SoNar was driven by the <italic>Insc-GAL4</italic> to indicate the NAD<sup>+</sup> level in NBs. Considering the protein accumulation in NBs due to the lower proliferation rate in glial ferritin knockdown group, the signal of SoNar was normalized to DsRed Stinger driven by <italic>Insc-GAL4</italic>. We observed significantly declined SoNar/DsRed after knocking down <italic>Fer2LCH</italic> (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4H and I</xref></bold>), suggesting the normalized level of NAD<sup>+</sup> in NBs was decreased, which supports the conclusion that the activity of NADH dehydrogenase was declined. To further verify the change of energy production, we utilized the ATP Determination Kit which offers a convenient bioluminescence assay for quantitative determination of ATP with recombinant firefly luciferase and its substrate D-luciferin. We found that ATP level decreased significantly after glial ferritin knockdown when compared to the control (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4J</xref></bold>). Therefore, we tried to supply the energy for NBs by restoring bioenergy-dependent NAD<sup>+</sup> metabolism. As expected, the NB number could be partially rescued by overexpressing proton-pump-independent yeast mitochondrial NADH dehydrogenase Ndi1 in NBs under the background of glial ferritin knockdown (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4K and L</xref></bold>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bonnay et al., 2020</xref>). In summary, the iron deficiency leads to NB loss due to the insufficient energy required for essential biological processes.</p>

<title>Glial ferritin maintains NBs via preventing premature differentiation</title>
<p>To investigate how glial ferritin knockdown leads to NB loss, we firstly examined whether NB origin was affected via altering the timing of ferritin knockdown. We used the temperature-sensitive GAL4 inhibitor GAL80<sup>ts</sup> to suppress ferritin RNAi at a permissive temperature (18â) during embryonic stage, and then shifted to a restrictive temperature (29â), or vice versa until we dissected them at the third-instar larval stage. Ferritin knockdown during the larval stage led to severe brain development defects (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A and B</xref></bold>), while the knockdown only during the embryonic stage showed no apparent abnormality (<bold><xref rid="fig5s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 5-figure supplement 1A</xref> and <xref rid="fig5s1" ref-type="fig">B</xref></bold>). Together, these results indicate that glial ferritin is required for NB maintenance at the larval stage. Consistent with this result, we found no obvious defects of brain at the first-instar larval stage (0-4 hours after larval hatching) when knocking down glial ferritin (<bold><xref rid="fig5s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 5-figure supplement 1C</xref></bold>). Since newborn NBs are delaminated from the neuroectoderm during the embryonic stage (stage 9 to 11), and ferritin RNAi only during the embryonic stage did not show any phenotype, suggesting that NB loss after glial ferritin knockdown is not ascribed to defective NB origin.</p>

<p>As mentioned before, we did not detect any apoptotic signal in the larval brain after glial ferritin knockdown, suggesting that there is no association between apoptosis and NB loss. The double binary systems, lexA/lexAop and GAL4/UAS, were employed to further exclude the possibility of apoptosis. We overexpressed P35 in NBs by <italic>Insc-GAL4</italic> and knocked down ferritin by <italic>repo-lexA</italic>, which failed to restore the decreased number of NBs (<bold><xref rid="fig5s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 5-figure supplement 1D</xref></bold>). These results reinforce the notion that NB loss occurs independent of the apoptotic pathway.</p>
<p>Next, we hypothesized that the NB loss might be attributed to nuclear-Prospero (Pros)-dependent premature differentiation of NBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Cabernard &amp; Doe, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Choksi et al., 2006</xref>). Pros in NB nuclear was hardly detected in third-instar WT larvae, but was increased significantly with glial ferritin knockdown (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C and D</xref></bold>). To further verify that the NB loss caused by glial ferritin knockdown was due to nuclear-Pros-dependent premature differentiation, we used the <italic>Insc-GAL4</italic> to drive <italic>UAS-pros-RNAi</italic> in order to prevent the NB loss in glial ferritin knockdown background. We found that the NB number was substantially restored (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E and F</xref></bold>). Interestingly, despite of dramatic NB number increase, the decreased proliferation rate was not rescued. We proposed that <italic>pros</italic> knockdown in NBs blocked premature terminal differentiation, but it could not replenish the reduced energy caused by glial ferritin knockdown. As NB self-renewal and proliferation are both energy-consuming processes, the self-renewal was rescued via inhibiting differentiation by <italic>Insc-GAL4</italic> driving <italic>UAS-pros-RNAi</italic>, but at the expense of energy consumption for proliferation, leaving the proliferation rate unchanged, or even lower. Together, we conclude that glial ferritin maintains the number of NBs by preventing the nuclear-Pros-dependent premature differentiation.</p>
<p>Given that reduced proliferation is a distinctive characteristic of quiescent NBs, we tried to determine whether NBs were in a quiescent state after glial ferritin knockdown by examining the other two key features associated with quiescent NBs: decreased cell size and the formation of the extended cellular protrusions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Chell &amp; Brand, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Ly et al., 2019</xref>). However, we found that the NB size remained at the same level as control, and the extended cellular protrusion was not observed after glial ferritin knockdown (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref> and <xref rid="fig5s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 5-figure supplement 2A</xref></bold>). Furthermore, since insulin signaling is necessary and sufficient to reactivate NBs from quiescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Sousa-Nunes, Yee, &amp; Gould, 2011</xref>), we tried to overexpress a constitutively active form of InR (InR<sup>act</sup>) in NBs to promote reactivation at the background of glial ferritin knockdown. However, InR<sup>act</sup> overexpression failed to ameliorate the NB abnormalities including the decreased proliferation (<bold><xref rid="fig5s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 5-figure supplement 2B</xref> and <xref rid="fig5s2" ref-type="fig">C</xref></bold>). In conclusion, NBs exhibited a low proliferation rate after glial ferritin knockdown, but were not in a quiescent state.</p>

<p>To verify whether iron is involved in the tumor suppression induced by blocking glial ferritin, we tried to decrease iron level by adding the iron chelator BPS in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> food. Tumor formation in the brain at the third instar larval stage was induced with the same method as mentioned above. The addition of BPS into dietary food significantly reduced the tumor size (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C and D</xref></bold>), suggesting that iron is required for tumor development in <italic>Drosophila</italic> larval brain. Considering the conservation of ironâs fundamental function as an essential nutrient for cell growth and proliferation, we thus tried to suppress brain tumor in mice via iron deficiency. Initially, we constructed orthotopic glioma model in C57BL/6J mice. One week after inoculation of glioma cells (GL261-luc), the iron chelator DFP was intraperitoneally injected every two days based on the murine weight until being dissected on day 7, 14, and 21, respectively. Histological examination with HE staining revealed that the size of glioma in mice, injected with DFP, decreased significantly on day 14 and 21 (<bold><xref rid="fig6s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 6-figure supplement 1A-C</xref></bold>). Since glioma cells GL261-luc carry the luciferase gene, we injected the substrate luciferin potassium salt into the tumor-bearing mice and detected the bioluminescence signal of mouse gliomas using IVIS Spectrum. This result showed that the bioluminescence signal of glioma in mice with the injection of 10 mg/ml DFP was significantly reduced (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6E and F</xref></bold>). The above results suggested that iron deficiency induced by DFP could suppress glioma in mice effectively. Furthermore, we assessed the survival time of the tumor-bearing mice with DFP or saline injection and found that 10 mg/ml DFP injection could significantly prolong the survival time of tumor-bearing mice (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6G</xref></bold>).

<title>Glial ferritin level is regulated by NBs</title>
<p>The aforementioned results have highlighted the significant role of glial ferritin in controlling NB number and proliferation. We next wonder whether NBs could provide feedback to regulate glial ferritin level. To answer this question, we analyzed ferritin level after altering NB proliferation. Previous studies have corroborated that NB proliferation was diminished by blocking Tor signaling pathway or enhanced by knocking down tumor suppressor genes, such as <italic>brat</italic> or <italic>numb</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bowman et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Reichardt et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Sousa-Nunes et al., 2011</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Here we demonstrate that glia regulates iron metabolism in the brain to sustain NBs and their proliferation. Glial ferritin coordinates Zip13 to provide iron for NBs. Once ferritin in glia is defective, NBs proliferate much slower and differentiate prematurely, implying that iron is a necessary metallic element for NBs. Iron participates in the synthesis of Fe-S clusters which activate aconitase required for TCA and facilitate electron-transfer processes involved in OxPhos. Since TCA and OxPhos are essential steps of ATP production, glial ferritin supplies iron into NBs to ensure energy production for maintaining NBs and their proliferation (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7E</xref></bold>).</p>
<sec id="s3a">
<title>NSCs and glial niche</title>
<p>Previous literatures have reported how glial niche regulates NB reactivation, proliferation, and survival. Blood-brain barrier (BBB) glia secretes dILP2 and dILP6 that bind on InR of NBs, which switches on Insulin signaling to reactivate NBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Chell &amp; Brand, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Speder &amp; Brand, 2014</xref>). In addition, Pvr (PDGFR ortholog) signaling in cortex glia sustains NB survival and proliferation in a PI3K-DE-cadherin-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Read, 2018</xref>). However, it is unknown whether glial niche is required for maintaining the self-renewal of NBs. In this study, we demonstrate that glial niche maintains the self-renewal and proliferation of NBs through supplying the necessary microelement iron into NBs for enough energy production, which implies that mammalian glia likewise provides critical microelement for maintaining NSC function. Oligodendrocytes have been reported to secret ferritin to protect neuron (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Mukherjee et al., 2020</xref>), however, it remains unknown whether the ferritin secretion is employed by oligodendrocytes to regulate NSCs. Astrocytes regulate NSC proliferation via secreting growth factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Shetty, Hattiangady, &amp; Shetty, 2005</xref>), but it is unclear whether ferritin from astrocytes regulates NSC proliferation and other NSC behaviors, such as self-renewal and differentiation. Based on our findings, it is feasible to regulate the self-renewal and differentiation of NSCs indirectly through niche cells, which would help to reduce the risk of directly manipulating NSCs to treat neural diseases.</p>

<title>Ferritin and iron</title>
<p>Our results show that ferritin generated outside the brain was not detected in the CNS and vice versa (data not shown), suggesting ferritin can hardly cross the BBB glia, possibly because ferritin is too large to permeate. In this way, BBB glia separates the labile systemic iron from local iron inside the brain to guarantee the normal brain development, as the neural cells, including NBs, require a stable iron level for continuous energy generation during neurogenesis.</p>
<p>Although the dominant function of ferritin is iron storage in mammal, increasing evidence suggests that ferritin also can transport iron. In mice, ferritin heavy chain is secreted by oligodendrocytes via extracellular vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Mukherjee et al., 2020</xref>), which possibly endows ferritin with the function of iron transport. Consistently, previous results showed that ferritin can deliver iron across the cultured BBB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Chiou et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Fisher et al., 2007</xref>). Our results emphasize the critical role of ferritin in iron transport in the CNS. Future studies would be interesting to investigate whether ferritin is able to transport iron in the mammalian brain.</p>
<p>Ferritin specifically targets on the tumor cells, which has been applied to tumor visualization and targeted drug delivery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Fan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Fan et al., 2018</xref>). Our study shows that the block of ferritin or iron can inhibit tumor effectively, which offers an explanation that ferritin targets on tumor is to transport iron for maintaining the cell proliferation, highlighting a potential target for tumor suppression.</p>
<p>Iron is an essential component for Fe-S clusters which participate in TCA and OxPhos, providing energy required for self-renewal and proliferation of NBs. Previous study claimed that OxPhos is required for NB proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">van den Ameele &amp; Brand, 2019</xref>). However, another research observed that OxPhos is dispensable in type II NBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bonnay et al., 2020</xref>). Our data imply that energy deficiency in NBs caused by iron shortage leads to NB loss and low proliferation possibly through simultaneous disruption of TCA and OxPhos. Consistently, iron-loaded ferritin nanoparticles can be used to improve the self-renewal ability and differentiation potential of human NSCs in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Lee, Yang, Cho, &amp; Cho, 2018</xref>). Additionally, previous study has shown that iron-loaded ferritin can promote the proliferation of cultured cell from <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Li, 2010</xref>). Furthermore, iron depletion was reported to suppress human cancer cell growth at G1/S by inducing cyclin D1 proteolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Nurtjahja-Tjendraputra, Fu, Phang, &amp; Richardson, 2007</xref>). These studies suggest that iron, as a necessary microelement for energy production, is essential to NSC maintenance and proliferation.</p>

<title>Bicellular iron homeostasis</title>
<p>Iron homeostasis can be regulated systemically by the liver-derived hormone hepcidin and the iron exporter ferroportin, and it is also regulated cellularly by the IRP/IRE system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Hentze, Muckenthaler, Galy, &amp; Camaschella, 2010</xref>). Here we propose a bicellular iron homeostasis between NB and glial niche cell, which is distinct from classic cellular and systemic iron homeostasis. The bicellular iron homeostasis requires an elaborate mechanism to guarantee normal neurogenesis.</p>
<p>In a proliferative state, NBs receive iron from glial cells via ferritin to fulfill the energy requirements for proliferation and self-renewal. Therefore, the iron required by NBs is mainly stored in the ferritin of glial cells and allocated as needed. The bicellular iron homeostasis mechanism makes glial cells the main pool for ferritin production, relieving NBs from the need to produce ferritin and transferring the potential risk of iron overload-induced oxidative stress to glial cells. Furthermore, glial cells can subsequently clear oxidative stress through lipid droplets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bailey et al., 2015</xref>), ensuring normal NB function during neural development. It is intriguing to explore whether bicellular iron homeostasis exists in other stem cells and their niches.</p>
<p>When normal NBs are converted into immortal tumor NBs, becoming highly proliferative, they need more nutrients including iron (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bonnay et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">van den Ameele &amp; Brand, 2019</xref>). In response, more ferritin is generated to transport iron from the glial cells to NBs. However, it is unclear how NBs communicate with glial cells to determine the level of ferritin production. Itâs interesting to identify the specific cues from NBs that regulate the level of ferritin in future studies. In addition, iron distribution in <italic>Drosophila</italic> brain is not observed due to low iron concentration and technical limitations in iron detection, which results in a lack of direct evidence for iron trafficking via ferritin.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
This study unveils a novel role for ferritin in Drosophila larval brain development. Furthermore, it pinpoints that the observed defects in larval brain development resulting from ferritin knockdown are attributed to impaired Fe-S cluster activity and ATP production. In addition, knocking down ferritin genes suppressed the formation of brain tumors induced by brat or numb RNAi in Drosophila larval brains. Similarly, iron deficiency suppressed glioma in the mice model. Overall, this is a well-conducted and novel study.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
Thorough analyses with the elucidation of molecular mechanisms.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
Some of the conclusions are not well supported by the results presented.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
Zhixin and collaborators have investigated if the molecular pathways present in glia play a role in the proliferation, maintenance, and differentiation of Neural Stem Cells. In this case, Drosophila Neuroblasts are used as models. The authors find that neuronal iron metabolism modulated by glial ferritin is an essential element for Neuroblast proliferation and differentiation. They show that loss of glial ferritin is sufficient to impact on the number of neuroblasts. Remarkably, the authors have identified that ferritin produced in the glia is secreted to be used as an iron source by the neurons. Therefore iron defects in glia have serious consequences in neuroblasts and likely vice versa. Interestingly, preventing iron absorption in the intestine is sufficient to reduce NB number. Furthermore, they have identified Zip13 as another regulator of the process. The evidence presented strongly indicates that loss of neuroblasts is due to premature differentiation rather than cell death.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
- Comprenhensive analysis of the impact of glial iron metabolism in neuroblast behaviour by genetic and drug-based approaches as well as using a second model (mouse) for some validations.</p>
<p>
- Using cutting-edge methods such as RNAseq as well as very elegant and clean approaches such as RNAi-resistant lines or temperature-sensitive tools</p>
<p>
- Goes beyond the state of the art highlighting iron as a key element in neuroblast formation as well as as a target in tumor treatments.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
Although the manuscripts have clear strengths, there are also some strong weaknesses that need to be addressed.</p>
<p>
- Some literature is missing</p>
<p>
- In general, the authors succeeded but in some cases, the authorsÂ´ claims are not fully supported by the evidence presented and additional experiments are critical to discriminate among different hypotheses.</p>
<p>
- Moreover, some potential flaws might be present in the analysis of cell death and mitochondrial iron.</p>

<p>In this manuscript, Ma et al seek to identify stem cell niche factors. They perform an RNAi screen in glial cells and screen for candidates that support and maintain neuroblasts (NBs) in the developing fly brain. Through this, they identify two subunits of ferritin, which is a conserved protein that can store iron in cells in a non-toxic form and release it in a controlled manner when and where required. They present data to support the conclusion that ferritin produced in glia is released and taken up by NBs where it is utilised by enzymes in the Krebs cycle as well as in the electron transport chain. In its absence from glia, NBs are unable to generate sufficient energy for division and therefore prematurely differentiate via nuclear prospero resulting in small brains. The work will be of interest to those interested in neural stem cells and their non-cell autonomous control by niches.</p>
<p>The past decade has seen a growing appreciation of how glial cells support and maintain NBs during development. The authors' discovery of glial-derived ferritin providing essential iron atoms for energy production is interesting and important. They have employed a variety of genetic tools and assays to uncover how ferritin in glia might support NBs. This is particularly challenging because there are no direct ways of assaying for iron or energy consumption in a cell-specific manner.</p>
<p>There are however instances where conclusions are drawn to support the story being developed without considering the equally plausible alternative explanations that should ideally be addressed.</p>
<p>For example, the data supporting the transfer of ferritin from glia to NBs was weak given the misexpression system used; the Shi[ts] experiment was also not convincing (perhaps they have more representative images?).</p>
<p>The iron manipulation experiments are in the whole animal and it is likely that this affects general feeding behaviour, which is known to affect NB exit from quiescence and proliferative capacity. The loss of ferritin in the gut and iron chelators enhancing the NB phenotype are used as evidence that glia provide iron to NB to support their number and proliferation. Since the loss of NB is a phenotype that could result from many possible underlying causes (including low nutrition), this specific conclusion is one of many possibilities.</p>
<p>Similarly, knockdown of the FeS protein assembly components phenocopy glial ferritin knock down. Since iron is so important for the TCA and the ETC, this is not surprising, but the similarities in the two phenotypes seem insufficient to say that it's glial ferritin that's causing the lack of iron in the NB and therefore resulting in loss of NBs.</p>

<p>This study, which seeks to identify factors from the glial niche that support and maintain neural stem cells, unveils a novel role for ferritin in this process. Furthermore, the work shows that defects in larval brain development resulting from ferritin knockdown can be attributed to impaired Fe-S cluster activity and ATP production. These findings will be valuable to both oncologists and neurobiologists, though the supporting evidence is currently incomplete.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This study unveils a novel role for ferritin in Drosophila larval brain development. Furthermore, it pinpoints that the observed defects in larval brain development resulting from ferritin knockdown are attributed to impaired Fe-S cluster activity and ATP production. In addition, knocking down ferritin genes suppressed the formation of brain tumors induced by brat or numb RNAi in Drosophila larval brains. Similarly, iron deficiency suppressed glioma in the mice model. Overall, this is a well-conducted and novel study.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Thorough analyses with the elucidation of molecular mechanisms.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Some of the conclusions are not well supported by the results presented.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We really appreciate your review and positive feedback. As for weaknesses, we will try our best to solidate the related conclusions.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Zhixin and collaborators have investigated if the molecular pathways present in glia play a role in the proliferation, maintenance, and differentiation of Neural Stem Cells. In this case, Drosophila Neuroblasts are used as models. The authors find that neuronal iron metabolism modulated by glial ferritin is an essential element for Neuroblast proliferation and differentiation. They show that loss of glial ferritin is sufficient to impact on the number of neuroblasts. Remarkably, the authors have identified that ferritin produced in the glia is secreted to be used as an iron source by the neurons. Therefore iron defects in glia have serious consequences in neuroblasts and likely vice versa. Interestingly, preventing iron absorption in the intestine is sufficient to reduce NB number. Furthermore, they have identified Zip13 as another regulator of the process. The evidence presented strongly indicates that loss of neuroblasts is due to premature differentiation rather than cell death.</p>

<p>We used Caspase-3 or TUNEL to indicate the apoptosis signal. Further, we overexpressed the anti-apoptosis gene p35 to inhibit apoptosis and found no rescue effect on neuroblast number. The results of these experiments are consistent.</p>
<p>It is difficult to determine the mitochondrial iron of neuroblast, so we used indirect methods to test ferroptosis, such as TEM and iron (or iron chelator) supplement. We will perform more experiments according to recommendations to determine that.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>In this manuscript, Ma et al seek to identify stem cell niche factors. They perform an RNAi screen in glial cells and screen for candidates that support and maintain neuroblasts (NBs) in the developing fly brain. Through this, they identify two subunits of ferritin, which is a conserved protein that can store iron in cells in a non-toxic form and release it in a controlled manner when and where required. They present data to support the conclusion that ferritin produced in glia is released and taken up by NBs where it is utilised by enzymes in the Krebs cycle as well as in the electron transport chain. In its absence from glia, NBs are unable to generate sufficient energy for division and therefore prematurely differentiate via nuclear prospero resulting in small brains. The work will be of interest to those interested in neural stem cells and their non-cell autonomous control by niches.</p>
<p>The past decade has seen a growing appreciation of how glial cells support and maintain NBs during development.</p>
<p>The authors' discovery of glial-derived ferritin providing essential iron atoms for energy production is interesting and important. They have employed a variety of genetic tools and assays to uncover how ferritin in glia might support NBs. This is particularly challenging because there are no direct ways of assaying for iron or energy consumption in a cell-specific manner.</p>
<p>There are however instances where conclusions are drawn to support the story being developed without considering the equally plausible alternative explanations that should ideally be addressed.</p>
<p>For example, the data supporting the transfer of ferritin from glia to NBs was weak given the misexpression system used; the Shi[ts] experiment was also not convincing (perhaps they have more representative images?).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks for your comment. We have the negative control, which excludes the misexpression. As for Shits experiment, we will substitute for more representative images.</p>

<p>The iron manipulation experiments are in the whole animal and it is likely that this affects general feeding behaviour, which is known to affect NB exit from quiescence and proliferative capacity. The loss of ferritin in the gut and iron chelators enhancing the NB phenotype are used as evidence that glia provide iron to NB to support their number and proliferation. Since the loss of NB is a phenotype that could result from many possible underlying causes (including low nutrition), this specific conclusion is one of many possibilities.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Iron chelator (or iron salt) feeding is a common method for investigating metal metabolism in Drosophila[1-3]. And other metal chelators (such as copper and zinc chelator) do not have similar phenotype (data not shown), which can partially exclude this possibility. Further, iron absorption was blocked by knockdown of ferritin only in the iron cell region[1], a small part of midgut, which phenocopied iron chelator feeding, implying iron deficiency is probably the main cause of the phenotype. More importantly, iron chelator only enhances the NB phenotype in the ferritin knockdown group, not the control group, suggesting iron deficiency results in the phenotype, which rules out other possibilities.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Similarly, knockdown of the FeS protein assembly components phenocopy glial ferritin knock down. Since iron is so important for the TCA and the ETC, this is not surprising, but the similarities in the two phenotypes seem insufficient to say that it's glial ferritin that's causing the lack of iron in the NB and therefore resulting in loss of NBs.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>It is hard to get this conclusion just by FeS protein assembly components knockdown, so we just used âimpliedâ to describe this result. However, we combine several results to address this issue, including iron chelator feeding, ferritin knockdown in the midgut, the enhancement of phenotype by iron chelators, aconitase activity, GO enrichment, KEGG enrichment, and Zip13. These results pointed to the interpretation that iron deficiency in NBs caused by glial ferritin defects leads to NB loss.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Pros RNAi will certainly result in an increase in NB numbers because the loss of pros results in an inability of NB progeny to differentiate. This (despite the slight increase in nuclear pros) is not sufficient to infer that glial ferritin knockdown results in premature differentiation of NBs via nuclear pros.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>First, pros RNAi, brat RNAi, or numb RNAi can each result in an inability of NB progeny to differentiate, respectively[4-6]. If the rescue of NB number by pros RNAi mainly relies on the differentiation block of NB progeny, brat RNAi or numb RNAi is expected to similarly rescue the NB number. However, our results showed that only pros RNAi could rescue the NB number, while brat RNAi or numb RNAi could not.</p>
<p>Secondly, nuclear Pros represses genes required for self-renewal and is also required to activate genes for terminal differentiation[7]. Thus, Pros is kept in the cytoplasm and remains almost undetectable in the nuclei in normal NBs[8]. However, we observed the detectable Pros in the nuclei of some NBs after glial ferritin knockdown, and the NB number with detectable nuclear Pros was significantly increased when compared to control.</p>
<p>Altogether, we conclude that NBs tend to undergo premature differentiation after glial ferritin knockdown.</p>
