<title>Abstract</title><p>The exchange of metabolites (i.e., metabolic interactions) between bacteria in the rhizosphere determines various plant-associated functions. Systematically understanding the metabolic interactions in the rhizosphere, as well as in other types of microbial communities, would open the door to the optimization of specific pre-defined functions of interest, and therefore to the harnessing of the functionality of various types of microbiomes. However, mechanistic knowledge regarding the gathering and interpretation of these interactions is limited. Here, we present a framework utilizing genomics and constraint based modeling approaches, aiming to interpret the hierarchical trophic interactions in the soil environment. 243 genome-scale metabolic models of bacteria associated with a specific disease suppressive vs disease conducive apple rhizospheres were drafted based on genome resolved metagenomes, comprising an <italic>in-silico</italic> native microbial community. Iteratively simulating microbial community members’ growth in a metabolomics-based apple root-like environment produced novel data on potential trophic successions, used to form a network of communal trophic dependencies. Network-based analyses have characterized interactions associated with beneficial vs non-beneficial microbiome functioning, pinpointing specific compounds and microbial species as potential disease supporting and suppressing agents. This framework provides a means for capturing trophic interactions and formulating a range of testable hypotheses regarding the metabolic capabilities of microbial communities within their natural environment. Essentially, it can be applied to different environments and biological landscapes, elucidating the conditions for the targeted manipulation of various microbiomes, and the execution of countless predefined functions.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The rhizosphere serves as a hotspot for a diversity of interactions spanning from the secretion of organic compounds by plant roots to their uptake by the adjacent soil microbial community<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. These interactions form a complex network of metabolic exchanges whose structure and function has a considerable impact on plant health<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. Targeted secretion of exudates from plant roots’ into the environment is fundamental to the recruitment of specific microbes and the assembly of a plant-selected community (i.e., the rhizobiome)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>. Each plant has a unique profile of exudates guiding the formation of a specialized rhizobiome that is adapted to support its mineral absorption<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>, secret plant growth supporting compounds<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>, and provide protection against soil-borne microorganisms that are detrimental to its health<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. A comprehensive understanding of the dynamics within the rhizosphere, considering both plant-microbe and microbe-microbe interactions, can guide the targeted assembly and maintenance of plant-beneficial soil microbial systems<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. The development of such microbiome-based, plant-beneficial strategies presents ecologically sound alternatives to conventional, chemical-based solutions in supporting plant health and productivity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>‘Omics data in general and specifically metagenomics data analyses can potentially provide keys for unraveling the black box of plant-microbe and microbe-microbe interactions in complex ecosystems such as the soil<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>. Sequence-based analyses are, however, typically limited in terms of functional interpretation of community dynamics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>. Constraint based modeling (CBM) is an approach that allows for the simulation of bacterial-metabolic activity in a given environment based on the constraints imposed by the annotated microbial genomes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>. This approach has long been used for studying the physiology and growth of single cells, represented as Genome Scale Metabolic Models (GSMM), under varying conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>. Applying CBM over a GSMM can be used to assess the uptake and secretion of metabolites in the environment under study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>. Accordingly, when CBM is applied over multiple GSMMs, metabolite exchange profiles (secretion into and consumption from the environment) become interconnected. This sheds light on conditions supporting the growth of different bacterial groups within the community as well as their functional potential in the trophic network formed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Advancement of sequencing technologies alongside the development of automatic pipelines for GSMM construction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup> has promoted an increased use of CBM for the modeling of communities with growing complexity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>. The relevance of CBM to the study of microbiomes has been demonstrated in a variety of ecosystems and recent works have shown that CBM-based predictions can guide the development of strategies for microbiome management<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>. An accurate representation of microbial metabolic networks depends on the origin of the genomes analyzed. To date, most studies attempting to model the microbiome of specific ecosystems by GSMM represent native species using corresponding genome sequences from public depositories, a process which is usually referred to as 16S-based genome imputation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>. Genome recovery, or genome-resolved metagenomes, often referred to as Metagenome Assembled Genomes (MAGs) allows one to obtain full genomes directly from metagenomes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>. Constructing GSMMs based on MAGs derived from a specific biological sample<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup> or directly from a native community<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>, is fundamentally superior to using 16S-based genome imputation, for this approach enables a genuine view of the metabolic activities carried out <italic>in situ</italic>. Such an <italic>in silico</italic> representation of a native community (with respect to its environment) can be used to decrypt the myriad interconnected uptake and secretion exchange fluxes transpiring within the root-associated microbiome, spanning from root exudates to altered organic forms.</p>
<p>The current study describes the recovery of 395 unique MAGs from metagenomes constructed for the native rhizosphere community of apple rootstocks cultivated in orchard soil affected by apple replant disease (ARD)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>. Soils were amended with <italic>Brassicaceae</italic> seed meal, or were not amended, supporting the development of either disease-suppressive or disease-conducive root microbiomes, respectively<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>. MAGs were recovered from metagenomics data collected from these apple rhizosphere microbiomes. GSMMs constructed for the MAGs provide an <italic>in-silico</italic> representation of highly abundant species in the native rhizosphere community. CBM simulations were then conducted in a rhizosphere-like environment, where microbial uptake-secretion fluxes were connected to form a directional trophic network. The aims of this study were twofold: first, to provide a general framework for delineating inter-species interactions occurring in the rhizosphere environment (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>) and second, to characterize the metabolic roles specific groups of bacteria fulfill in seed meal-amended (disease-suppressive) vs non-amended (disease-conducive) apple rhizobiome communities.</p>

<label>1.</label><title>Assembly of a collection of MAGs representing a native microbial community from a soil agroecosystem</title>
<p>Metagenomic sequencing obtained from the rhizosphere of apple rootstocks grown in orchard soil with a documented history of replant disease resulted in a total of approximately 2 billion quality reads (after filtration) at a length of 150 bp, as described in Berihu et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>. Independent metagenomics assemblies of six different treatments yielded 1.4–2 million contigs longer than 2 kbp<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>. Here, assemblies were binned using MetaWRAP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup> into 296-433 high quality MAGs for each of the six treatments (Supp. Data 1; completion and contamination thresholds were set to 90/5, respectively<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>). De-replication (the process of combining highly similar genomes into a single representative genome) requiring 99% average nucleotide identity (ANI) of the overall 2233 MAGs yielded a collection of 395 unique MAGs (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). Across samples, 30-36% of the raw reads were mapped to the MAG collection (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbls1">Supp. Table 1</xref>), in comparison to 61–71% mapped to the non-binned contigs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>. Using GTDB-Tk<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup>, taxonomic annotations were assigned at the phylum, order, genus and species level for 395, 394, 237 and three of the de-replicated MAGs, respectively, reflecting the genuine diversity of the rhizosphere community, which include many uncharacterized species<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup>. Estimates of completion and contamination, total bin length and taxonomic affiliation for the MAG collections derived from each of the six assemblies, as well as the de-replicated MAGs, are provided in Supp. Data 1.</p>

<p>As in previous reports<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup>, Proteobacteria, Acidobacteria, Actinobacteria and Bacteroidetes were identified as the dominant phyla in the apple rhizosphere (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). Overall, the taxonomic distribution of the MAG collection corresponded with the profile reported for the same samples using alternative taxonomic classification approaches such as 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing and gene-based taxonomic annotations of the non-binned shotgun contigs (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>). At the genus level, MAGs were classified into 143 genera in comparison to approximately 3000 genera that were identified for the same data based on gene-centric approaches<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup> and approximately 1000 genera based on amplicon sequencing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup> of the same data.</p>
<p>The functional capabilities of the bacterial genomes in the apple rhizosphere were initially assessed based on KEGG functional annotations of their gene catalogue (Supp. Data 2, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Supp. Fig. 1</xref>). The ten most frequent functional categories across the MAG collection were involved in primary metabolism, e.g., carbohydrate metabolism, and the biosynthesis of essential cellular building blocks such as amino acids and vitamins. Specialized functional categories included those associated with autotrophic nutrition such as carbon fixation and metabolism of nitrogen, sulfur and methane. Functional diversity was found to exist also when considering ubiquitous functions. For instance, though all bacteria are in need of the full set of amino acids, most genomes lack the full set of relevant biosynthesis pathways. The prevalence of biosynthetic pathways across MAGs (requiring at least a single relevant enzyme) ranges from 99.5% (e.g. glycine; missing in only two genomes) to 21% (e.g. tyrosine; detected in only 83 MAGs). Notably, the diversity of metabolic pathway completeness regarding amino acids and other essential cellular components suggests that the majority of bacterial soil species rely on an external supply of at least some of their obligatory nutritional demands.</p>

<p>Categorical classifications of discrete gene-entities, such as pathway completeness analyses, have several inherent limitations as an approach for the contextualization and functional interpretation of genomic information. First, categorical classifications may underestimate the completeness of robust pathways with multiple redundant routes resulting in low pathway completeness. Second, pathway completeness analyses do not take into consideration the directionality and continuity of a biosynthetic process whose full conductance requires the availability of a specific environmental resource together with the required successive series of genes/reactions. Although functional potential can be inferred based on the static set of genes and enzymes present, actual metabolic performances of bacterial species in soil are dynamic and reflect multiple factors, including the availability of different nutritional sources. Such sources can be environmental inputs like root exudates or downstream exchange metabolites secreted by cohabiting bacteria.</p>
<p>To better understand environment-dependent metabolic activity occurring in a native rhizosphere, a set of 395 GSMMs was constructed for the entire collection of the rhizosphere-bacterial community MAGs. All models were systematically subjected to validity and quality tests using MEMOTE<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup>, leaving a total of 243 GSMMs whose stoichiometric consistency was confirmed (Supp. Data 3). On average, GSMMs included 1924 reactions, from which 203 were exchange reactions (specific reactions carrying out extracellular import and secretion of metabolites) and 1312 metabolites (Supp. Data 4). Altogether, the GSMM set held 5152 unique metabolic reactions, 597 exchange reactions, and 2671 different compounds. The distribution of key model attributes (reactions, metabolites and exchanges) across phyla is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Supp. Fig. 2</xref>. Model features were scalable with those reported by Basile et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup> and Heinken et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>. Additionally, comparison of GSMM scales indicated that the metabolic coverage (i.e., the number of reactions, which denote the potential of executing a metabolic function) of our data is within the same order of magnitude as described in recent large-scale automatic reconstructions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Next, species-specific rich (optimal) and poor (suboptimal) media were defined for each model in order to broadly assess GSMM growth capacity. A rich environment was defined as a medium containing all metabolites for which the model encodes an exchange reaction. A poor environment was defined as the minimal set of compounds enabling growth (see Methods). Essentially, poor environments contained species-specific carbon, nitrogen and phosphorous sources together with other trace elements. In addition to the two automatic media, we aimed to design a realistic simulating environment to explore the impact of the root exudates on the native community. To this end, metabolomics data from a set of studies which characterized the root exudates of Geneva 935 (G935) or Malling 26 (M26) rootstock cultivars<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup> - related to the G210 and M26 rootstocks whose rhizobiome was characterized here, were used to specify an array of apple root-derived compounds (Table 1). The list of secreted compounds was consistent with other reported profiles of plant root-exudates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>The growth of each of the 243 GSMMs was simulated in each of the three species-specific environments (rich, poor, poor + exudates; exudates were added to corresponding poor media to ensure the exudates have a feasible effect). As expected, growth performances were higher on the poor medium supplemented with exudates in comparison to growth on the poor medium alone but lower than the growth in rich medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">Supp. Fig. 3</xref>). Notably, GSMM growth patterns were not phylogenetically conserved and were inconsistent between related taxa. Moreover, ranking of models’ growth rate were inconsistent in the three different media (i.e., some models’ growth rates were markedly affected by the simulated media whereas others did not; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">Supp. Fig. 3</xref>). This inconsistency indicates that the effect of exudates on community members is selective and differs between species (i.e., exudates increase the growth rates of some species more than others), as was previously reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></sup>. The number of active exchange fluxes in each medium corresponds with the respective growth performances displaying noticably higher number of potentially active fluxes in the rich enviroenment (also when applying loopless FVA) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4">Supp. Fig. 4</xref>). Overall, Simulations confirmed the existence of a feasible solution space for all the 243 models as well as their capacity to predict growth in the respective environemnt (Supp. Data 5).</p>
<p>As a next step towards conducting simulations in a genuine natural-like environment, we aimed to define a single “rhizosphere environment” in which growth simulations for all models would take place. Unlike the species-specific root media (poor medium + exudates) which support growth of all models by artificially including multiple carbon sources that are derived from the automatic specifications of the poor medium, including such that are not provided by the root, this simulation environment was based on the root exudates (Table. 1) as the sole carbon sources. By avoiding the inclusion of non-exudate organic metabolites, the true-to-source rhizosphere environment was designed to reveal the hierarchical directionality of the trophic exchanges in soil, as rich media often mask various trophic interactions taking place in native communities<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref></sup>. Additionally, the rhizosphere environment also included an array of inorganic compounds used by the 243 GSMMs, which includes trace metals, ferric, phosphoric, and sulfuric compounds. Overall, the rhizosphere environment was composed of 60 inorganic compounds together with the 33 root exudates (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbls2">Supp. Table 2</xref>). The rhizosphere environment supported the growth of only a subset of the GSMMs that were capable of using plant exudates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">Supp. Fig. 3</xref>).</p>

<label>3.</label><title>Simulating growth succession and hierarchical trophic exchanges in the rhizosphere community</title>
<p>To reflect the indirect effect of the root on the native community, (i.e., to capture the effect of root-supported bacteria on the growth of further community members), we constructed the Microbial Community Succession Module (MCSM), a CBM-based algorithm aimed at predicting community-level trophic successions. Unlike tools designed for modelling microbial interactions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref></sup>, MCSM bypasses the need for defining a community objective function as the growth of each species is simulated individually. Trophic interactions are then inferred by the extent to which compounds secreted by bacteria could support the growth of other community members. The module iteratively grows the GSMMs in a defined environment, sums up their individual secretion profiles, and updates the initial simulation environment with those secreted compounds (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). Applying this algorithm to a microbiome in its native environment allows delineating the potential metabolic dependencies and interactions between bacterial species in a native community.</p>

</fig>
<p>Application of MCSM over the “rhizosphere environment” (i.e., 1<sup>st</sup> iteration, Root exudates and “inorganic compounds”, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbls2">Supp. Table 2</xref>) supported the growth of 27 GSMMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">Supp. Fig. 3</xref>, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>). Then, the initial environment was updated with 145 additional compounds predicted to be secreted by the growing community members. The 2<sup>nd</sup> iteration supported the growth of 33 additional species whose growth was supported by compounds predicted to be secreted by bacteria that grew in the 1<sup>st</sup> iteration. Following the 2<sup>nd</sup> iteration, 25 new secreted compounds were added to the rhizosphere environment. The 3<sup>rd</sup> iteration supported the growth of 11 additional GSMMs, with one additional compound secreted. After the 3<sup>rd</sup> iteration, the updated environment did not support the growth of any new species. Overall, iterative growth simulations resulted in the successive growth of 71 species (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>; iterations 1-3).</p>
<p>To enlarge the array of growing species, we tested the effect of the addition of organic phosphorous sources. Organic phosphorous is typically a limiting factor in soil<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref></sup> and its utilization varies greatly between microbial species (i.e., different P sources were shown to have a selective effect on different microbial groups<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref></sup>). The initial rhizosphere environment contained only inorganic phosphorous. During 1<sup>st</sup> -3<sup>rd</sup> MCSM simulations, nine organic P compounds were secreted to the simulation medium, which was updated accordingly. At the beginning of the 4<sup>th</sup> iteration, 31 additional organic P compounds were identified by screening the species-specific poor medium and were added to the medium (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbls2">Supp. Table 2</xref>; organic Phosphorous compounds). The additional organic P compounds supported the growth of nine additional GSMMs (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>) and led to the secretion of 13 new compounds, which were added to the environment. The 5<sup>th</sup> iteration supported the growth of four additional GSMMs and two new compounds were secreted. Final simulations in the cumulative rhizosphere environment were composed of all secreted compounds and led to the same secretion and growth profile as the previous iteration. Therefore, no further growth iterations were conducted.</p>
<p>Overall, the successive iterations connected 84 out of 243 native members of the apple rhizosphere GSMM community via trophic exchanges. The inability of the remaining bacteria to grow, despite being part of the native root microbiome, possibly reflects the selectiveness of the root environment, which fully supports the nutritional demands of only part of the soil species, whereas specific compounds that might be essential to other species are less abundant<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup>. It is important to note that the specific exudate profile used here represent a snapshot of the root metabolome as root secretion-profiles are highly dynamic, reflecting both environmental and plant developmental conditions. A possible complementary explanation to the observed selective growth might be the partiality of our simulation platform, which examined only plant-bacteria and bacteria-bacteria interactions while ignoring other critical components of the rhizosphere system such as fungi, archaea, protists and mesofauna, as well as less abundant bacterial species, components all known to metabolically interact<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref></sup>. Finally, the MAG collection, while relatively substantial, represents only part of the microbial community. Accordingly, the iterative growth simulations represent a subset of the overall hierarchical-trophic exchanges in the root environment, necessarily reflecting the partiality of the dataset.</p>
<p>In terms of the phylogenetic distribution of the models, 27 bacterial species grew on the 1<sup>st</sup> iteration (in which root exudates served as the sole organic sources). These bacteria represented 14 of the 17 phyla included in the initial model collection (consisting of 243 GSMMs) and maintained a distribution frequency similar to the original community. As in the full GSMM data set (Community bar, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>), most of the species which grew in the 1<sup>st</sup> iteration belonged to the phyla <italic>Acidobacteriota</italic>, <italic>Proteobacteria,</italic> and <italic>Bacteroidota</italic>. This result concurred with findings from the work of Zhalnina et al, which reported that bacteria assigned to these phyla are the primary beneficiaries of root exudates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. Species from three out of the 17 phyla that did not grow in the first iteration - <italic>Elusimicrobiota, Chlamydiota</italic>, and <italic>Fibrobacterota,</italic> did grow on the 2<sup>nd</sup> iteration (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>). Members of these phyla are known for their specialized metabolic dependencies. Such is the case for example with members of the <italic>Elusimicrobiota</italic> phylum, which include mostly uncultured species whose nutritional preferences are likely to be selective<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>At the order level, bacteria classified as <italic>Sphingomonadales</italic> (class <italic>Alphaproteobacteria</italic>), a group known to include typical inhabitants of the root environment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref></sup>, grew in the initial Root environment. In comparison, other root-inhabiting groups including the orders <italic>Rhizobiales</italic> and <italic>Burkholderiales</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref></sup>, did not grow in the first iteration. <italic>Rhizobiales</italic> and <italic>Burkholderiales</italic> did, however, grow in the second and third iterations, respectively, indicating that in the simulations, the growth of these groups was dependent on exchange metabolites secreted by other community members (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs5">Supp. Fig. 5</xref>).</p>
<p>Overall, 158 organic compounds were secreted throughout the MCSM simulation (from which 12 compounds overlapped with the original exudate medium). These compounds varied in their distribution and were mapped into 12 biochemical categories (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>). Whereas plant secretions are a source of various organic compounds, microbial secretions provide a source of multiple vitamins and co-factors not secreted by the plant. Microbial-secreted compounds included siderophores (staphyloferrin, salmochelin, pyoverdine, and enterochelin), vitamins (pyridoxine, pantothenate, and thiamin), and coenzymes (coenzyme A, flavin adenine dinucleotide, and flavin mononucleotide) – all known to be exchange compounds in microbial communities<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref></sup>. In addition, microbial secretions included 11 amino acids (arginine, lysine, threonine, alanine, serine, phenylalanine, tyrosine, leucine, glutamate, isoleucine, and methionine), also known as a common exchange currency in microbial communities<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref></sup>. Some microbial-secreted compounds, such as phenols and alkaloids, were reported to be produced by plants as secondary metabolites<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref></sup>. Additional information regarding mean uptake and secretion degrees of compounds classified to biochemical groups is found in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs6">Supp. Fig. 6</xref>.</p>
<p>Conceptually, the rhizosphere microbiota can be classified into two trophic groups: primary exudate consumers, comprising microbial species that are direct beneficiaries from the root exudates, and secondary consumers, comprising microbial species whose growth may be provided directly via the uptake of metabolites secreted by other members of the soil microbial community. In the iterative MCSM simulations, compounds secreted by some of the primary consumers largely sustained the growth of secondary consumers, which were not able to grow otherwise. The full information on the secretion profiles and models’ growths is provided in Supp. Data 6.</p>
<p>To validate the ability of MCSM to capture trophic dependencies and succession, we further tested whether it can track the well-documented example of cellulose degradation - a multi-step process conducted by several bacterial strains that go through the conversion of cellulose and its oligosaccharide derivatives into ethanol, acetate and glucose, which are all eventually oxidized to CO2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref></sup>. Here, the simulation followed the trophic interactions in an environment provided with cellulose oligosaccharides (4 and 6 glucose units) on the 1<sup>st</sup> iteration (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbls3">Supp. Table 3</xref>). The formed trophic successions detected along iterations captured the reported multi-step process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs7">Supp. Fig. 7</xref>).</p>

<label>4.</label><title>Associating trophic exchanges with soil health</title>
<p>The MAG collection analyzed in this study was constructed from shotgun libraries associated with apple rootstocks cultivated in orchard soil with a documented history of apple replant disease (ARD) and healthy/recovered (seed meal-amended) soils, providing a model system for disease-conducive vs disease-suppressive rhizosphere communities<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>. Briefly, rhizobiome communities obtained from apple rootstocks grown in replant orchard soil leading to symptomatic growth (non-amended samples) were termed ‘sick’, whereas samples in which disease symptoms were ameliorated following an established soil amendment treatment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref></sup>, were termed ‘healthy‘. Both sick and healthy plants were characterized by distinct differences in the structure and function of their rhizosphere microbial communities in the respective soil samples<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref></sup>. In order to correlate microbial metabolic interactions with soil performance, GSMMs were classified into one of three functional categories based on differential abundance (DA) patterns of their respective MAGs: predominantly associated with “healthy” soil (H), predominantly associated with “sick” soil (S) and none-associated (NA) (Supp. Data 7).</p>
<p>The functionally classified GSMMs (H, S, NA) were consolidated into a community network of metabolic interactions by linking their potential uptake and secretion exchange profiles (as predicted along growth iterations in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). The network was built as a directed bipartite graph, in which the 84 feasible GSMM nodes and the 203 metabolite nodes (27 root exudates, 146 microbial-secreted compounds, and 30 additional organic-P compounds) were connected by 9773 directed edges, representing the metabolic exchanges of organic compounds in the native apple rhizosphere community (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>). Further information regarding node degrees is found in Supp. Data 8.</p>

</fig>
<p>The directionality of the network enabled its untangling into sub-network motifs stemming from a root exudate to exchange interactions, and ending with an unconsumed end-metabolite. Two types of sub-networks were detected (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>): 3-component (PM; Plant-Microbe) plant exudate – microbe – microbial secreted metabolite; and 5-component (PMM; Plant-Microbe-Microbe) plant exudate – microbe – intermediate microbial secreted metabolite – microbe – microbial secreted metabolite. Overall, the network included 45,972 unique PM paths and 571,605 unique PMM paths. Participation of GSMMs in PM paths ranged from 272 to 896 occurrences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs8">Supp. Fig. 8A</xref>). GSSM participation in PMM paths ranged from 398 to 50,628 in the first microbe position (primary exudate consumer) and 1,388 to 19,738 occurrences in the second microbe position (secondary consumer). Frequency of GSMMs in the first position in PMM sub-network motifs was negatively correlated with the frequency of presence in second positions, possibly indicating species-specific preferences for a specific position/trophic level in the defined environment (Pearson=-0.279; p-value=0.009, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs8">Supp. Fig. 8B, C, D</xref>).</p>
<p>In order to explore the trophic preferences of bacteria associated with the different rhizosphere soil systems, the frequency of healthy (H), sick (S) or non-associated (NA) GSMMs in the PM and PMM sub-networks was compared (Supp. Data 9). GSMMs classified as S initiated a significantly higher number of PMM sub-networks (located in the first position) than GSMMs classified as NA and H (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>). H classified PMM paths (first position) initiated a significantly higher number of sub-networks with GSMMs classified as NA compared to S-classified GSMMs, but no more than H-classified GSMMs (second position). Other PMM types did not show a significant effect at the second position. The higher number of trophic interactions formed by the S-classified primary exudate consumers in the PMM sub-network motifs suggests that non-beneficial bacteria may have a broader spectrum in terms of their utilization potential of root-secreted carbon sources compared to plant-beneficial bacteria. This might shed light on the dynamics of ARD, in which S-classified bacteria become increasingly dominant following long-term utilization of apple-root exudates, resulting in diminished capacity of the rhizosphere microbiome to suppress soil-borne pathogens<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref></sup>.</p>

</fig>
<p>In order to predict exchanges with potential to support/suppress dysbiosis, the frequency of DA GSMM types (i.e., H or S) associated with metabolites (either consumed or secreted) in the PM paths was assessed (Supp. Data 10). Considering consumed metabolites (root exudates), three and six compounds were found to be significantly more prevalent in H and S-classified PM paths, respectively (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>). Notably, the S-classified root exudates included compounds reported to support dysbiosis and ARD progression. For example, the S-classified compounds gallic acid and caffeic acid (3,4-dihidroxy-trans-cinnamate) are phenylpropanoids – phenylalanine intermediate phenolic compounds secreted from plant roots following exposure to replant pathogens<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref></sup>. Though secretion of these compounds is considered a defense response, it is hypothesized that high levels of phenolic compounds can have autotoxic effects, potentially exacerbating ARD. Additionally, it was shown that genes associated with the production of caffeic acid were upregulated in ARD-infected apple roots, relative to those grown in γ-irradiated ARD soil<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref></sup>, and that root and soil extracts from replant-diseased trees inhibited apple seedling growth and resulted in increased seedling root production of caffeic acid<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>As to the microbial-secreted compounds, a total of 79 unique compounds were found to be significantly overrepresented in either S (42 compounds) or H (41 compounds) classified PM paths (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>). Several secreted compounds classified as healthy exchanges (H) were reported to be potentially associated with beneficial functions. For instance, the compounds L-Sorbose (EX_srb L_e) and Phenylacetaladehyde (EX_pacald_e), both over-represented in H paths (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>), have been shown to inhibit the growth of fungal pathogens associated with replant disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">73</xref></sup>. Phenylacetaladehyde has also been reported to have nematicidal qualities<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">74</xref></sup>. Combining both exudate uptake data and metabolite secretion data, the full H-classified PM path 4-Hydroxybenzoate; GSMM_091; catechol (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>; the consumed exudate, the GSMM, and the secreted compound, respectively) provides an exemplary model for how the proposed framework can be used to guide the design of strategies which support specific, advantageous exchanges within the rhizobiome. The root exudate 4-Hydroxybenzoate is metabolized by GSMM_091 (class <italic>Verrucomicrobiae</italic>, order <italic>Pedosphaerales</italic>) to catechol. Catechol is a precursor of a number of catecholamines, a group of compounds which was recently shown to increase apple tolerance to ARD symptoms when added to orchard<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">75</xref></sup>. This analysis (PM; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4C</xref>), leads to formulating the testable prediction that 4-Hydroxybenzoate can serve as a selective enhancer of catecholamine synthesizing bacteria associated with reduced ARD symptoms, and therefore serve as a potential source for indigenously produced beneficial compounds.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>In this study, we present a framework combining metagenomics analyses with CBM, which can be used to gain a deeper understanding of the functionality, dynamics and division of labor among rhizosphere bacteria, and link their environment-dependent metabolism to biological significance. This exploratory framework aims to illuminate the black box of interactions occurring in the rhizospheres of crop plants and is based on the work of Berihu et al. 2022, in which a gene-centric analysis of metagenomics data from apple rhizospheres was conducted<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>We recovered high-quality sets of environment-specific MAGs, constructed the corresponding GSMMs, and simulated community-level metabolic interactions. By including authentic apple root exudates in the models, we were able to begin untangling the highly complex plant-bacterial and bacterial-bacterial interactions occurring in the rhizosphere environment. More specifically, we used the framework to investigate a microbial community via examining its hierarchical secretion-uptake exchanges along multiple iterations (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). These analyses, which linked community-derived secretion profiles with the growth of other community members, demonstrated the successive, trophic-dependent nature of microbial communities. These interactions were elucidated via construction of a community-exchange network (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). Possible connections between root exudates, differentially abundant bacteria, their secreted end-products, and soil health were explored using the data derived from this network. From these analyses, we were able to associate different metabolic functionalities with diseased or healthy systems, and formulate new hypotheses regarding the general function of differentially abundant bacteria in the community.</p>
<p>The framework we present is currently conceptual. Dealing with a highly complex system such as the rhizobiome inevitably comes with limitations. These limitations include the usage of automatic GSMM reconstruction, inherent caveats of CBM and the use of single-species GSMMs, the lack of transcriptomic and spatial-chemo-physical data, and the exclusion of competition over all its forms. Furthermore, a portion of the metabolomics data used in this framework was taken from a different source (different rootstock genotype), possibly introducing further bias to the analyses. This potential factor is due to the inherent discrepancy between the conditions from which genomics and metabolomics data were collected<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>. Also not considered in this framework is the role of eukaryotes in the microbial-metabolic interplay. Moreover, the use of an automatic GSMM reconstruction tool (CarveMe<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>), though increasingly used for depicting phenotypic landscapes, is generally less accurate than manual curation of metabolic models<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>. This approach typically neglects specialized functions involving secondary metabolism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup> and introduces additional biases such as the overestimation of auxotrophies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">76</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">77</xref></sup>. Nevertheless, manual curation is practically non-realistic for hundreds of MAGs, an expected outcome considering the volume of sequencing projects nowadays. As the primary motivation of this framework is the development of a tool capable of transforming high-throughput, low-cost genomic information into testable predictions, the use of automatic metabolic network reconstruction tools was favored, despite their inherent limitations, in pursuit of addressing the necessity of pipelines systematically analyzing metagenomics data.</p>
<p>For these reasons, among others, the framework presented here is not intended to be used as a stand-alone tool for determining microbial function. The framework presented is designed to be used as a platform to generate educated hypotheses regarding bacterial function in a specific environment in conjunction with actual carbon substrates available in the particular ecosystem under study. The hypotheses generated provide a starting point for experimental testing required to gain actual, targeted and feasible applicable insights<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>. While recognizing its limitations, this framework is in fact highly versatile and can be used for the characterization of a variety of microbial communities and environments. Given a set of MAGs derived from a specific environment and environmental metabolomics data, this computational framework provides a generic simulation platform for a wide and diverse range of future applications.</p>
<p>In the current study, the root environment was represented by a single pool of resources (metabolites). As genuine root environments are highly dynamic and responsive to stimuli, a single environment can represent at best a temporary snapshot of the conditions. Conductance of simulations with several sets of resource pools (e.g., representing temporal variations in exudation profile) can add insights on their effect on trophic interactions and community dynamics. In parallel, confirming predictions made in various environments will support an iterative process that will strengthen the predictive power of the framework and improve its accuracy as a tool for generating testable hypotheses. Similarly, complementing the genomics-based approaches done here with additional layers of ’omics information (mainly transcriptomics &amp; metabolomics) can further constrain the solution space, deflate the number of potential metabolic routes and yield more accurate predictions of GSMMs’ performances<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>To summarize, we have constructed a framework enabling the analysis of interactions between microbes and between microbes and their hosts in their natural environment. Where recent studies begin to apply GSMM reconstruction and analysis starting from MAGs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">78</xref></sup>, this work applies the MAGs to GSMMs approach to conduct large-scale CBM analysis over high-quality MAGs derived from a native rhizosphere and explore the complex network of interactions in light of the functioning of the respective agro-ecosystem.</p>
<p>The application of this framework to the apple rhizobiome yielded a wealth of preliminary knowledge about the metabolic interactions occurring within it, including novel information on putative functions performed by bacteria in healthy vs. replant-diseased soil systems, and potential metabolic routes to control these functions. Overall, this framework aims to advance efforts seeking to unravel the intricate world of microbial interactions in complex environments including the plant rhizosphere. The framework is provided as a three stage-detailed pipeline in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/FreilichLab/Trophic_interactions_predicting_framework">https://github.com/FreilichLab/Trophic_interactions_predicting_framework</ext-link>.</p>

<title>Recovery of Metagenomics Assembled Genomes MAGs from metagenomics data constructed for apple rhizosphere microbiomes</title>
<p>High coverage shotgun metagenomics sequence data were obtained from microbial DNA extracted from the rhizosphere of apple rootstocks cultivated in soil from a replant diseased orchard<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>. The experimental design included sampling of six different soil/apple rootstock treatments with five biological replicates each, as described in Somera et al. 2021<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>. Two different apple rootstocks (M26, ARD susceptible; G210, ARD tolerant) were grown in three different treatments: 1) orchard soil amended with <italic>Brassica napus</italic> seed meal, 2) orchard soil amended with <italic>Brassica juncea</italic>/<italic>Sinapis alba</italic> seed meal (BjSa) and 3) no-treatment control soil (NTC) (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbls1">Supp. Table 1</xref>). Microbial DNA was extracted from rhizosphere soil and metagenomics data were assembled as described in<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>. In each assembly contigs were binned to recover MAGs using MetaWRAP pipeline (v1.3.1), which utilizes several independent binners<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>. The MAGs recovered by the different binners were collectively processed with the Bin_refinement module of metaWRAP, producing an output of a refined bin collection. A count table was constructed by mapping raw reads data of each assembly (e.g., BjSa; G210) to the bins, using BWA-MEM mapping software (version 0.7.17) with default parameters. Differential abundance (DA) of the reads associated with the respective bins in each assembly across the respective replicates was determined using the edgeR function implemented in R, requiring FDR adapted <italic>p</italic> value&lt; 0.05. Read mapping information is shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbls1">Supp. Table 1</xref>. Based on DA, MAGs were classified either as associated with healthy soil (H; BjSa differentially abundant), sick soil (S; NTC differentially abundant), or not associated with either soil type (NA; not differentially abundant at any treatment site).</p>
<p>Gene calling and annotation was performed with the Annotate_bins module of MetaWRAP. Pathway completeness was determined with KEGG Decoder v 1.0.8.2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">79</xref></sup> based on the KO annotations extracted from Annotate_bins assignments. The quality of the genomes was determined with CheckM<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">80</xref></sup>. For phylogenomic analyses and taxonomic classification of each bacterial and archaeal genome, we searched for and aligned 120 bacterial marker genes of the MAGs using the identity and align commands of GTDB-Tk v1.5.0<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup>. MAGs were dereplicated using dRep v2.3.2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">81</xref></sup> using the default settings and MAGs from the six assemblies were clustered into a single non-redundant set. Phylogenomic trees were rooted by randomly selecting a genome from the sister lineage to the genus as determined from the topology of the bacterial and archaeal GTDB R06-RS202 reference trees. Closely related GTDB taxa identified with the “classify_wf” workflow were filtered using the taxa-filter option during the alignment step. Overall, a set of 395 high-quality genomes (≥90% completeness, &lt;5% contamination) was used for downstream analyses.</p>

<sec id="s4b">
<title>Genome Scale Metabolic Model (GSMM) reconstruction, analysis and characterization of the MAG collection</title>
<p>GSMMs were constructed for each of the 395 MAGs using CarveMe v 1.5.1 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>, a python-based tool for GSMM reconstruction. Installation and usage of CarveMe was done as suggested in the original CarveMe webpage (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://carveme.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">https://carveme.readthedocs.io/en/latest/</ext-link>). The solver used for GSMM reconstruction is Cplex (v. 12.8.0.0). All GSMMs were drafted without gap filling as it might mask metabolic co-dependencies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref></sup>. Stoichiometric consistency of all GSMMs was systematically assessed via the standardized MEMOTE test suite, a tool for GSMM quality and completion assessment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup>. GSMMs not stoichiometrically balanced were filtered out, as they might produce infeasible simulation results.</p>
<p>Analyses and simulations of GSMMs, as well as retrieval of model attributes (reactions, metabolites and exchanges, etc.), were conducted via the vast array of methods found in COBRApy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">82</xref></sup>, a python coding language package for analyzing constraint-based reconstructions. For each GSMM, initial growth simulations took place in three different model-specific environments: rich medium, poor medium and poor medium + exudates. The rich medium was composed of all the exchange reactions (i.e., exchange reaction for specific compounds) a model holds, gathered by the “exchanges” attribute found in each model. The poor medium was composed of the minimal set of compounds required for a specific GSMM/species to grow at a fixed rate. This set of compounds was identified using the minimal_medium module from COBRApy (minimize components=True, growth rate of 0.1 biomass increase hour<sup>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>). Poor medium + exudates was defined as the poor medium with the addition of an array of apple root exudates. These compounds were retrieved from two metabolomics studies characterizing the exudates of apple rootstocks grown in Lane Mountain Sand (Valley, WA)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup>. Exudate compounds were aligned with the BIGG database<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">83</xref></sup> in order to format them for use in COBRApy. For each media type, GSMM growth rates were calculated by solving each model using the summary method in COBRApy, which utilizes Flux Balance Analysis (FBA) for maximizing biomass.</p>

<sec id="s4c">
<title>Construction of a common root environment medium and application of the Microbial Community Succession Module (MCSM)</title>
<p>In order to simulate the dynamics of the rhizosphere community in the root environment, a fourth growth medium representing a natural-like environment was defined and termed the “rhizosphere environment”. The rhizosphere environment was composed of two arrays of compounds: 1) the exudates (as described above) and 2) inorganic compounds essential for sustaining bacterial growth. This array was determined according to the minimal set of compounds identified for each GSMM (also described above). Rhizosphere environment components are provided in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbls2">Supp. Table 2</xref>. Both sets of compounds were then consolidated into one array in which further simulations were conducted.</p>
<p>The MCSM (which is the first module out of three comprising this computational framework) simulates the growth of a microbial community by iteratively growing the GSMMs in the community and adding compounds “secreted” by the growing species to the simulation-environment (i.e. the medium), thus enriching the medium/environment and supporting further growth. Unlike Flux Balance Analysis (FBA), which is used for gathering an arbitrary solution regarding non-optimized fluxes, the MCSM uses Flux Variability Analysis (FVA) to determine exchange fluxes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">84</xref></sup>. FVA gathers the full range of exchange fluxes (including both secretion and uptake) that satisfy the objective function of a GSMM (i.e., biomass increase). The FVA fraction of optimum was set to 0.9 (sustaining the objective function at 90% optimality, allowing a less restricted secretion profile). Secretion compounds added to the updated medium in each iteration were set to be given in optimal fluxes in next iteration, to ensure a metabolic effect based on the presence of specific metabolites in the environment, rather than their quantity. Flux boundaries of updated medium components were set to 1000 mmol/ gDW hour (for a specific exchange compound; gDW gram Dry Weight).</p>
<p>MCSM was initially simulated in the rhizosphere environment medium. After each growth iteration, GSMM growth-values and the compounds secreted by the species growing were collected, where the latter were added to the medium for the next iteration as described above. Growth iterations continued until no new compounds were secreted and no additional GSMMs had grown. After the 3<sup>rd</sup> iteration, a set of organic phosphorous compounds (containing both carbon and phosphorous) was added to the environment. These compounds were gathered from the pool of model-specific minimal compounds selected for use in the poor medium. Information regarding the chemical formula of these compounds was gathered with the formula attribute of each compound object in COBRApy. Along MCSM iterations, secreted metabolites were classified into biochemical categories based on BRITE annotations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">85</xref></sup> or, in the absence of classification, manually. MCSM was further applied to inspect the framework’s ability to tracing cellulose degradation using cellulose medium (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbls3">Supp. Table 3</xref>). The tutorial for the MCSM stage of the framework workflow is found at the GitHub page, along with the GSMMs and media files. Instructions for conducting the analysis are in the README.md file <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/FreilichLab/Trophic_interactions_predicting_framework">https://github.com/FreilichLab/Trophic_interactions_predicting_framework</ext-link>.</p>

<sec id="s4d">
<title>Construction of the exchange network and its untangling for screening sub-network motifs</title>
<p>For each GSMM, a directed bipartite network representing all potential metabolic exchanges occurring within the rhizosphere community was constructed based on uptake and secretion data derived from MCSM iterations. Edges in the network were connected between GSMM nodes and metabolite nodes, with edge directionality indicating either secretion or uptake of a metabolite by a specific GSMM. The network was constructed with the networkx package, a python language package for the exploration and analysis of networks and network algorithms. Network-specific topography was obtained using the Kamada-kawai layout<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">86</xref></sup>. Information regarding the degree and connectivity of the different node types was acquired from the graph object (G). Code for the network construction module in the framework is found at the project’s GitHub page under the name NETWORK.py.</p>
<p>Untangling the exchange network into individual paths (i.e. sub-network motifs) was done using the all_shortest_paths function in networkx<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">86</xref></sup>, applied over the exchanges network. Briefly, the algorithm screens for all possible shortest paths within the network, specifically screening for paths starting with an exudate node and ending secreted metabolite nodes (secreted by bacterial species but not consumed). This algorithm yielded two types of paths: 1) plant-microbe paths (PM) in which node positions one, two, and three represented exudate, microbe and secreted metabolite, respectively, and 2) plant-microbe-microbe paths (PMM). PMM paths (length of five nodes) were constructed based on PM paths (length of three nodes), in which positions four and five displayed unique (i.e. not found in PM paths) microbe and metabolite nodes, respectively. Code for the network untangling module in the framework is found at the project’s GitHub page under the name PATHS.py.</p>

<sec id="s4e">
<title>Associating PM and PMM sub-network motifs features with soil health</title>
<p>Sub-network motifs (PM and PMM) were functionally classified as associated with healthy soil (H), sick soil (S), or not-associated with either soil type (NA) based on differential abundance of the corresponding MAGs (PM) or MAGs combination (PMM) in the sub-network. Next, the GSMMs in both PM and PMM sub-networks were characterized according functional classification. For PMMs, the distribution of counts of classified sub-networks, at the different positions, was compared using the ANOVA test, followed by a Tukey test to significantly distinguish the groups. GSMM classifications were further projected on uptake and secreted metabolites in the pathway motifs. For simplification, the analysis focused only on PM paths because PMM paths incorporate PM paths, and exchanges within a PMM path do not directly reflect the effect of an exudate on the secreted end-product (but over the intermediate compound). On that account, start/end metabolites in PM paths were associated with H/S/NA paths based on one-sided hypergeometric test, comparing the frequency of each compound in a functionally characterized path type (either H or S) vs. its frequency in NA classified paths and the reciprocal data set.</p>

<p>The work by Ginatt et al. uses genome-scale metabolic modeling to identify and characterize trophic interactions between rhizosphere-associated bacteria. Beyond identifying microbial species associated with specific host and soil traits (e.g., disease tolerance), a detailed understanding of the interactions underlying these associations is necessary for developing targeted microbiome-centered interventions for plant health. It has nonetheless remained challenging to define the roles of specific organisms and metabolic species in natural rhizobiomes. Here, the authors combine microbial compositional data obtained through metagenomic sequencing with a new collection of genome-scale models to predict interactions in the native rhizosphere communities of apple rootstocks. To do this, they have established processes to integrate these sources of data and model specific trophic exchanges, which they use to obtain testable hypotheses for targeted modulation of microbiota members in situ.</p>
<p>The authors carry out a careful model curation process based on metagenomic sequencing data and existing model generation tools, which, together with basing the in silico medium composition on known root exudates, strengthens their predictions of interaction network features. Moreover, its reliance on genome-scale models provides a broader basis for linking sequence-based information to predictions of function on a multispecies level beyond rhizosphere microbiomes.</p>
<p>Having generated a set of predicted trophic interactions, the authors carried out a detailed analysis linking features of these interactions to organism taxonomy and broader ecosystem properties. Intriguingly, the organisms predicted to grow in the first iteration of their framework (i.e., on only root exudates) broadly correspond to taxonomic groups experimentally shown to benefit from these compounds. Additionally, the simulations predicted some patterns of vitamin and amino acid secretion that are known to form the basis for interactions in the rhizosphere. Together, these outcomes underscore the applicability of this method to help disentangle trophic interaction networks in complex microbiomes.</p>
<p>The methodology described in this paper represents a useful and promising framework to better understand the complexity of microbial interaction networks in situ. In particular, the authors' simulation of trophic interactions based on cellulose degradation have generated predictions of interactions that can more readily be validated. While a more complete analysis of the method's sensitivity to environmental composition is still needed to fully interpret its conclusions - particularly those predicting the inability of many of the in silico organisms to produce biomass - it represents a valuable addition to the growing toolkit of computational and experimental methods for generating educated hypotheses on complex trophic networks.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This study presents a solid framework for the metabolic modeling of microbial species and resources in the rhizosphere environment. It is an ambitious effort to tackle the huge complexity of the rhizosphere and reveal the plant-microbiota interactions therein. Considering previously published data by Berihu et al., going through a series of steps, the framework then finds associations between an apple tree disease state and both microbes and metabolites. The framework is well explained and motivated. I think that further work should be done to validate the method, both using synthetic data, with a known ground truth and following up on key findings experimentally.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>- The manuscript is well written with a good balance between detail and readability. The framework steps are well motivated and explained.</p>
<p>- The authors faithfully acknowledge the limitations of their approach and do not try to &quot;over-sell&quot; their conclusions.</p>
<p>- The presented framework has potential for significant discovery if the hypotheses generated are followed up with experimental validation.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>- It would be better for the framework to be validated on synthetic data.</p>
<p>Justification of claims and conclusions:</p>
<p>The claims and conclusions are sufficiently well justified since the limitations of this approach are acknowledged by the authors.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Public Reviews:</bold></p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>…the degree to which the predictions can vary according to environmental composition remains difficult to quantify, and the work does not address the sensitivity of the modeling predictions beyond a simulated medium containing 33 root exudates. I find this especially important given that relatively few (84 of 243) species were predicted to grow even after cross-feeding, suggesting that a richer medium could lead to different interaction network structures. While the authors do state the importance of environmental composition and have carefully designed an in silico medium, I believe that simulating a broader set of resource pools would add necessary insight into both the predictive power of the models themselves and trophic interactions in the rhizosphere more generally.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The original analyses were indeed focused on a single well-defined environment supporting the growth of only a subset of the species. We have added a paragraph to the discussion section dealing with the potential limitations of this approach.</p>
<p>On line 289 we write:</p>
<p>&quot;Overall, the successive iterations connected 84 out of 243 native members of the apple rhizosphere GSMM community via trophic exchanges. The inability of the remaining bacteria to grow, despite being part of the native root microbiome, possibly reflects the selectiveness of the root environment, which fully supports the nutritional demands of only part of the soil species, whereas specific compounds that might be essential to other species are less abundant1. It is important to note that the specific exudate profile used here represent a snapshot of the root metabolome as root secretion-profiles are highly dynamic, reflecting both environmental and plant developmental conditions. A possible complementary explanation to the observed selective growth might be the partiality of our simulation platform, which examined only plant-bacteria and bacteria-bacteria interactions while ignoring other critical components of the rhizosphere system such as fungi, archaea, protists and mesofauna, as well as less abundant bacterial species, components all known to metabolically interact2. Finally, the MAG collection, while relatively substantial, represents only part of the microbial community. Accordingly, the iterative growth simulations represent a subset of the overall hierarchical-trophic exchanges in the root environment, necessarily reflecting the partiality of the dataset.&quot;</p>
<p>In addition, we have tried to better explain the advantages of a limited/defined medium to such an analysis. On Line 231 we add:</p>
<p>&quot;By avoiding the inclusion of non-exudate organic metabolites, the true-to-source rhizosphere environment was designed to reveal the hierarchical directionality of the trophic exchanges in soil, as rich media often mask various trophic interactions taking place in native communities3&quot;</p>
<p>More generally, beyond the above justification of our specific medium selection, we agree that simulating a broader set of resource pools would contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of the trophic interactions. Therefore, we conducted the analysis in an additional environment, in which cellulose was used as an input. We were able to follow its well-documented degradation via multiple steps, conducted by different community members, to serve as a benchmark to our suggested framework.</p>
<p>On line 357 we add:</p>
<p>&quot;To validate the ability of MCSM to capture trophic dependencies and succession, we further tested whether it can trace the well-documented example of cellulose degradation - a multi-step process conducted by several bacterial strains that go through the conversion of cellulose and its oligosaccharide derivatives into ethanol, acetate and glucose, which are all eventually oxidized to CO24. Here, the simulation followed the trophic interactions in an environment provided with cellulose oligosaccharides (4 and 6 glucose units) on the 1st iteration (Supp. Table 3). The formed trophic successions detected along iterations captured the reported multi-step process (Supp.</p>
<p>Fig.7).&quot;</p>
<p>Finally, we have included additional text regarding the challenge of defining our simulation environment in the Discussion section.</p>
<p>On line 532 we add:</p>
<p>&quot;In the current study, the root environment was represented by a single pool of resources (metabolites). As genuine root environments are highly dynamic and responsive to stimuli, a single environment can represent, at best, a temporary snapshot of the conditions. Conductance of simulations with several sets of resource pools (e.g., representing temporal variations in exudation profile) can add insights regarding their effect on trophic interactions and community dynamics. In parallel, confirming predictions made in various environments will support an iterative process that will strengthen the predictive power of the framework and improve its accuracy as a tool for generating testable hypotheses. Similarly, complementing the genomicsbased approaches used here with additional layers of 'omics information (mainly transcriptomics &amp; metabolomics) can further constrain the solution space, deflate the number of potential metabolic routes and yield more accurate predictions of GSMMs' performances5.&quot;</p>
<p>And we add in Line 520:</p>
<p>&quot;For these reasons, among others, the framework presented here is not intended to be used as a stand-alone tool for determining microbial function. The framework presented is designed to be used as a platform to generate educated hypotheses regarding bacterial function in a specific environment in conjunction with actual carbon substrates available in the particular ecosystem under study. The hypotheses generated provide a starting point for experimental testing required to gain actual, targeted and feasible applicable insights6,7. While recognizing its limitations, this framework is in fact highly versatile and can be used for the characterization of a variety of microbial communities and environments. Given a set of MAGs derived from a specific environment and environmental metabolomics data, this computational framework provides a generic simulation platform for a wide and diverse range of future applications.&quot;</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>There are two main drawback approaches like the one described here, both related only partially to the authors' work yet with great impact in the presented framework. First, the usage of automatic GSMM reconstruction requires great caution. It is indicative of how the semicurated AGORA models are still considered reconstructions and expect the user to parameterize those in a model. In this study, CarveMe was used. CarveMe is a well-known tool with several pros [1]. Yet, several challenges need to be considered when using it [2]. For example, the biomass function used might lead to an overestimation of auxotrophies. Also, as its authors admit in their reply paper, CarveMe does gap fill in a way [3]; models are constructed to ensure no gaps and also secure a minimum growth. However, curation of such a high number of GSMMs is probably not an option. Further, even if FVA is way more useful than FBA for the authors' aim, it does not yet ensure that when a species secretes one compound (let's say metabolite A), the same flux vector, i.e. the same metabolic functioning profile, secretes another compound (metabolite B) at the same time, even if the FVA solution suggests that metabolite B could be secreted in general.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank Reviewer #2 for highlighting this key limitation of our analysis. Below and in the 'recommendations to authors' section we address these concerns.</p>
<p>Concerning the first point raised (models' accuracy) we have now clearly acknowledged in the text the limitations of using an automated GSMM reconstruction tool such as CarveMe. More generally, the framework applied here was built in order to meet the challenges of analyzing highthroughput data while acknowledging the inherent potential of introducing inaccuracies. Pros &amp; cons are now discussed.</p>
<p>On line 507 we write:</p>
<p>&quot;Moreover, the use of an automatic GSMM reconstruction tool (CarveMe8), though increasingly used for depicting phenotypic landscapes, is typically less accurate than manual curation of metabolic models9. This approach typically neglects specialized functions involving secondary metabolism10 and introduces additional biases such as the overestimation of auxotrophies11,12. Nevertheless, manual curation is practically non-realistic for hundreds of MAGs, an expected outcome considering the volume of nowadays sequencing projects. As the primary motivation of this framework is the development of a tool capable of transforming high-throughput, low-cost genomic information into testable predictions, the use of automatic metabolic network reconstruction tools was favored, despite their inherent limitations, in pursuit of addressing the necessity of pipelines systematically analyzing metagenomics data.&quot;</p>
<p>Regarding using FVA solutions, indeed such solutions return all potential metabolic fluxes in GSMMs (ranges of all fluxes satisfying the objective function, which by default is set to biomass increase) in a given environment. However, as indicated by the reviewer, predicted fluxes do not necessarily co-occur (i.e., when a metabolite is secreted another metabolite is not necessarily secreted too), yet, they provide the full set of potential solutions (unlike the single solution provided by FBA). A possible strategy to reduce inflated predictions provided by FVA and further constrain the solution space (reduce the set of metabolic fluxes) can be the incorporation of additional `omics data layers, as for example was done in the work of Zampieri et al5. Such approach could allow for instance limiting active reactions (blocking fluxes) from the network reconstructions if not coming to play <italic>in</italic> <italic>situ</italic>, and therefore impose further constraints and narrow the solution space. We now refer in the text to this limitation and to potential routes to overcome it.</p>
<p>On line 541 we now write:</p>
<p>Similarly, complementing the genomics-based approaches done here with additional layers of 'omics information (mainly transcriptomics &amp; metabolomics) can further constrain the solution space, deflate the number of potential metabolic routes and yield more accurate predictions of GSMMs' performances5.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>When presenting a computational framework, best practices include running it on artificial (synthetic) data where the ground truth is known and therefore the precision and accuracy of the method may be assessed. This is not an optional step, the same way that positive/negative controls in lab experiments are not optional. Without this validation step, the manuscript is severely limited. The authors should ask themselves: what have we done to convince the reader that the framework actually works, at least on our minimal synthetic data?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for this suggestion. To validate the ability of MCSM to capture trophic succession, we conducted an additional analysis testing whether it can track the well documented example of cellulose degradation - a multi-step process conducted by several bacterial strains. This example has been included in the manuscript to serve as a case study (i.e. positive control) for metabolic interactions occurring within the bacterial community (Supp. Fig. 7).</p>
<p>On line 357 we add:</p>

Here, the simulation followed the trophic interactions in an environment provided with cellulose oligosaccharides (4 and 6 glucose units) on the 1st iteration (Supp. Table 3). The formed trophic successions detected along iterations captured the reported multi-step process (Supp. Fig.</p>
<p>7).&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Supplementary Figure 7. Application of MCSM over the process of cellulose decomposition as described by Kato et al4. 5-partite network exhibiting the uptake of cellulose oligomers (4 and 6 units of connected D-glucose) by primary decomposers, through secretion of intermediate compounds and their metabolization by secondary decomposers to CO2. Distribution of phyla of primary and secondary decomposers is denoted by pie charts. Though MAGs were not constructed for the original species as in Kato et al., among the primary consumers, species corresponding to the Acidobacteria (Acidobacteriales)13, Actinobacteria14, Bacteriodetes15, Proteobacteria (Xanthomonadales)16 and Verrucobacteria17 groups are found to be capable of degrading cellulose compounds via enzymatic mechanisms.&quot;</p>
<p>More generally, beyond the above addition, the relevance of the framework to the analysis of the data is discussed throughout the analysis (in the original version of the manuscript). We have scrutinized each of our observations in light of current available information and provided a corroborating evidence as well as a few discrepancies for multiple steps in the analysis.  Examples include the following discussions:</p>
<p>On line 312, we discuss the biological relevance of taxonomic classes classified as primary versus secondary degraders</p>
<p>&quot;As in the full GSMM data set (Community bar, Fig. 3C), most of the species which grew in the 1st iteration belonged to the phyla <italic>Acidobacteriota</italic>, <italic>Proteobacteria,</italic> and <italic>Bacteroidota</italic>. This result concurred with findings from the work of Zhalnina et al, which reported that bacteria assigned to these phyla are the primary beneficiaries of root exudates18. Species from three out of the 17 phyla that did not grow in the first iteration - <italic>Elusimicrobiota, Chlamydiota</italic>, and <italic>Fibrobacterota,</italic> did grow on the 2nd iteration (Fig. 3C). Members of these phyla are known for their specialized metabolic dependencies. Such is the case for example with members of the <italic>Elusimicrobiota</italic> phylum, which include mostly uncultured species whose nutritional preferences are likely to be selective19.</p>
<p>At the order level, bacteria classified as <italic>Sphingomonadales</italic> (class <italic>Alphaproteobacteria</italic>), a group known to include typical inhabitants of the root environment20, grew in the initial Root environment. In comparison, other root-inhabiting groups including the orders <italic>Rhizobiales</italic> and _Burkholderiales_20, did not grow in the first iteration. <italic>Rhizobiales</italic> and <italic>Burkholderiales</italic> did, however, grow in the second and third iterations, respectively, indicating that in the simulations, the growth of these groups was dependent on exchange metabolites secreted by other community members (Supp. Fig. 4).&quot;</p>
<p>On line 331, we provide support to the classification of specific metabolites as exchange molecules</p>
<p>&quot;Overall, 158 organic compounds were secreted throughout the MCSM simulation (from which 12 compounds overlapped with the original exudate medium). These compounds varied in their distribution and were mapped into 12 biochemical categories (Fig. 3D). Whereas plant secretions are a source of various organic compounds, microbial secretions provide a source of multiple vitamins and co-factors not secreted by the plant. Microbial-secreted compounds included siderophores (staphyloferrin, salmochelin, pyoverdine, and enterochelin), vitamins (pyridoxine, pantothenate, and thiamin), and coenzymes (coenzyme A, flavin adenine dinucleotide, and flavin mononucleotide) – all known to be exchange compounds in microbial communities21,22. In addition, microbial secretions included 11 amino acids (arginine, lysine, threonine, alanine, serine, phenylalanine, tyrosine, leucine, glutamate, isoleucine, and methionine), also known as a common exchange currency in microbial communities23. Some microbial-secreted compounds, such as phenols and alkaloids, were reported to be produced by plants as secondary metabolites24,25. Additional information regarding mean uptake and secretion degrees of compounds classified to biochemical groups is found in Supp. Fig. 5.&quot;</p>
<p>On line 432, we provide corroborative support to the classification of exudates as associated with beneficial/non beneficial root communities</p>
<p>&quot;Notably, the S-classified root exudates included compounds reported to support dysbiosis and ARD progression. For example, the S-classified compounds gallic acid and caffeic acid (3,4-dihidroxy-trans-cinnamate) are phenylpropanoids – phenylalanine intermediate phenolic compounds secreted from plant roots following exposure to replant pathogens26. Though secretion of these compounds is considered a defense response, it is hypothesized that high levels of phenolic compounds can have autotoxic effects, potentially exacerbating ARD. Additionally, it was shown that genes associated with the production of caffeic acid were upregulated in ARD-infected apple roots, relative to those grown in γ-irradiated ARD soil27,28, and that root and soil extracts from replant-diseased trees inhibited apple seedling growth and resulted in increased seedling root production of caffeic acid29.&quot;</p>
<p>On line 446, we provide a supporting evidence to the classification of secreted compounds as associated with beneficial/non beneficial root communities</p>
<p>&quot;Several secreted compounds classified as healthy exchanges (H) were reported to be potentially associated with beneficial functions. For instance, the compounds L-Sorbose (EX_srb__L_e) and Phenylacetaladehyde (EX_pacald_e), both over-represented in H paths (Fig. 5C), have been shown to inhibit the growth of fungal pathogens associated with replant disease30,31.</p>
<p>Phenylacetaladehyde has also been reported to have nematicidal qualities32.&quot;</p>
<p>On line 453 we discuss the correspondence of specific exudate uptakes and compound secretions via specific subnetwork motifs (PM) and their literature/experimental evidence</p>
<p>&quot;Combining both exudate uptake data and metabolite secretion data, the full H-classified PM path 4-Hydroxybenzoate; GSMM_091; catechol (Fig. 4C; the consumed exudate, the GSMM, and the secreted compound, respectively) provides an exemplary model for how the proposed framework can be used to guide the design of strategies which support specific, advantageous exchanges within the rhizobiome. The root exudate 4-Hydroxybenzoate is metabolized by GSMM_091 (class <italic>Verrucomicrobiae</italic>, order <italic>Pedosphaerales</italic>) to catechol. Catechol is a precursor of a number of catecholamines, a group of compounds which was recently shown to increase apple tolerance to ARD symptoms when added to orchard6,33. This analysis (PM; Fig 4C), leads to formulating the testable prediction that 4-Hydroxybenzoate can serve as a selective enhancer of catecholamine synthesizing bacteria associated with reduced ARD symptoms, and therefore serve as a potential source for indigenously produced beneficial compounds.&quot;</p>
<p>Moreover, we perceive our analysis as a strategy for integrating high throughput genomic data into testable predictions allowing narrowing the solution space while acknowledging potential inaccuracies that are inherent to the analysis. We have revised the text in order to clearly acknowledge this limitation.</p>

<p>&quot;The framework we present is currently conceptual.&quot;</p>
<p>On line 520 we write:</p>
<p>&quot;For these reasons, among others, the framework presented here is not intended to be used as a stand-alone tool for determining microbial function. The framework presented is designed to be used as a platform to generate educated hypotheses regarding bacterial function in a specific environment in conjunction with actual carbon substrates available in the particular ecosystem under study. The hypotheses generated provide a start point for experimental testing required to gain actual, targeted and feasibly applicable insights6,7.&quot;</p>
<p>On line 532 we add:</p>
<p>&quot;In the current study, the root environment was represented by a single pool of resources (metabolites). As genuine root environments are highly dynamic and responsive to stimuli, a single environment can represent, at best, a temporary snapshot of the conditions. Conductance of simulations with several sets of resource pools (e.g., representing temporal variations in exudation profile) can add insights regarding their effect on trophic interactions and community dynamics. In parallel, confirming predictions made in various environments will support an iterative process that will strengthen the predictive power of the framework and improve its accuracy as a tool for generating testable hypotheses. Similarly, complementing the genomicsbased approaches used here with additional layers of 'omics information (mainly transcriptomics &amp; metabolomics) can further constrain the solution space, deflate the number of potential metabolic routes and yield more accurate predictions of GSMMs' performances5.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Unlike tools designed for modelling microbial interactions34,35, MCSM bypasses the need for defining a community objective function as the growth of each species is simulated individually.

<p>CarveMe solves a Mixed Integer Linear Program (MILP) that enforces network connectivity, thus requiring gapless pathways. It's puzzling how to deal with such a great number of GSMMs that is for sure, especially when coming from such an environment as soil and the vast majority of their corresponding MAGs represent most likely novel taxa. One alternative approach for using CarveMe might be to use the rich medium as a medium to gap-fill during the reconstruction. In this case, the gene annotation scores that CarveMe calculates in its initial step, are used to prioritise the reactions selected for gap-filling. This would lead to a new series of challenges but might be a useful comparison with the current GSMMs of the study.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Though indeed CraveMe includes a gap-filling option, here we have purposely avoided the gapfilling option as we aimed to adhere to genomic content of the corresponding genomes and to avoid masking their metabolic dependencies emerging due to their incompleteness. This is noted in the Methods section, which we revised to emphasize the adherence to the genomic content of the models:</p>
<p>On line 615 we now write:</p>
<p>&quot;All GSMMs were drafted without gap filling in order to adhere to genomic content and to avoid masking metabolic co-dependencies51&quot;</p>
<p>More generally, we now refer to the limitation of automatic reconstruction in the context of the current analysis. On line 507 we write:</p>
<p>&quot;Moreover, the use of an automatic GSMM reconstruction tool (CarveMe8), though increasingly used for depicting phenotypic landscapes, is typically less accurate than manual curation of metabolic models9. This approach typically neglects specialized functions involving secondary metabolism10 and introduces additional biases such as the overestimation of auxotrophies11,12. Nevertheless, manual curation is practically non-realistic for hundreds of MAGs, an expected outcome considering the volume of nowadays sequencing projects. As the primary motivation of this framework is the development of a tool capable of transforming high-throughput, low-cost genomic information into testable predictions, the use of automatic, semi-curated, metabolic network reconstruction tools was favored, despite their inherent limitations, in pursuit of developing pipelines for the systematic analysis of metagenomics data.&quot;</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Thermodynamically infeasible loops have been a challenge in constraint-based analysis [1].</p>
<p>However, for the case of FBA and FVA time efficient implementations are already available. Therefore, I would suggest using the loopless flag of the cobrapy package when performing FVA.</p>
<p>Also, it would be nice to show/discuss how many exchange reactions each GSMM includes and what is the number of those with at least a non-zero minimum or maximum in the FVA using each of the three media.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Done. In Supplementary Figure 4, we added a graphic summary of active FVA ranges for each GSMM in the three different environments (exchange reactions, non-zero flux). Additionally, we analyzed a subset of models and compared their regular FVA results vs loopless FVA results.</p>
<p>On line 217 we write:</p>
<p>&quot;The number of active exchange fluxes in each medium corresponds with the respective growth performances displaying noticably higher number of potentially active fluxes in the rich environment (also when applying loopless FVA) (Supp. Fig. 4). Overall, Simulations confirmed the existence of a feasible solution space for  all the 243 models as well as their capacity to predict growth in the respective environemnt (Supp. Data 5).&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Supplementary Figure 4. FVA performances of GSMMs in different environments (Supp. Fig.</p>
<p>3; Supp. Data 5). A. Distribution of potentially active exchange reactions (non-zero minimum FVA flux) in the different environments. Solid line inside each violin indicates the interquartile range (IQR). White point in IQR indicates the median value. Whiskers extending from the IQR indicate the range within 1.5 times the IQR from the quartiles. Violin width at a given value represents the density of data points at that value. B. Loopless FVA scores compared to regular FVA for models in the 3 different environments. Bars indicate the count of active fluxes (nonzero minimum FVA flux). Only a subset of models was used for this analysis.&quot;</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>This brings us to the main challenge of your framework in my opinion: FVA returns the minimum and the maximum a flux may get. However, it does not ensure that when a metabolite is being secreted, another does the same too. That could lead to an overrepresentation of secreted metabolites after each iteration. To my understanding, unbiased methods focusing on metabolite exchanges would be a much better alternative for such questions. Unbiased constraint-based methods are known for requiring essential computational requirements, yet when focusing on specific parts of the models, recent implementations support them. A great showcase of such techniques is presented in [2].</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Indeed, FVA solutions return all <italic>potential</italic> metabolic fluxes in GSMMs (ranges of all fluxes satisfying the objective function, which by default is set to biomass increase) but they do not ensure that all fluxes actually co-occur (i.e., when a metabolite is secreted necessarily another metabolite is secreted too). However, though FVA solutions do not necessarily ensure cooccurrence regarding secretion and uptake, they provide a broader metabolic picture (the full set of potential solutions), unlike the arbitrary single solution provided by FBA, which is limited in providing information about potential secretions and uptakes in a specific environment. Here, we tried to elucidate the connection between a specific environment (root exudates) and the growth and metabolic capabilities of native bacteria. To the best of our understanding,  unbiased approaches (such as the one displayed in Wedmark et al.36) are not environment dependent but rather calculate all possible metabolic elements and routes within a metabolic network. Therefore, using FVA is well adapted to explore environment-dependent growth. The sensitivity of FVA predicted active fluxes to the environments is now also implied by Sup. Fig. 3B demonstrating the number of potential active fluxes is proportional to growth performances.  In addition, inquiring all possible metabolic routes across a large dataset of hundreds of MAGS, is central to the current analysis, thus the easy implementation of FVA further justifies its use in the current study.</p>
<p>An alternative strategy to reduce inflated FVA predictions and further constrain the solution space of predicted active fluxes can be the incorporation of additional layers of `omics data, as for example was done in the work of Zampieri et al5. Such approach could allow for instance removing reactions from the network reconstructions if not coming to play <italic>in</italic> <italic>situ</italic>, and therefore impose further constraints and narrow down the solution space. Currently, the complexity of the soil community might impede or at least constrain a high coverage recovery of transcriptomic data, though future works utilizing additional layers of `omics data are expected to significantly reduce the number of potential solutions and thus improve the accuracy of GEMs predictions.</p>
<p>This is now discussed in the text. In line 541 we write:</p>
<p>&quot;Similarly, complementing the genomic-based approaches done here, with additional layers of 'omics information (mainly transcriptomics &amp; metabolomics) can further constrain the solution space, deflate the number of potential metabolic routes and yield more accurate predictions of GSMMs' performances5.&quot;</p>

<p>In case it was the first version of CheckM used, the authors could consider repeating this check with CheckM2. As they state in line 293, Archaea may play an essential role in the community. Yet, among the high-quality MAGs only one corresponded to Archaea. However, that is quite possible to be the case because CheckM underestimates the completeness of archaeal genomes. If CheckM2 suggests that archaeal MAGs could be used, these would probably benefit a lot for the aim of the study.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The analysis was conducted with the first version of CheckM to assess MAGs quality. In future analyses we will use CheckM2. However, also before MAG recovery, we already know from the work of Beirhu et al., that Archaea species have a very low representation in the metagenomics data used here (Berihu et al., Additional data 2. Supp. fig. 4; &quot;others&quot; group)6, with less than 0.5% of the contigs mapped to archaeal genomes. The overall taxonomic distribution of the high-quality MAGs was compared to the distribution inferred from the non-binned data (contigs) and amplicon sequencing and the three different data sets are very similar (Fig. 2).</p>
<p>On line 130 we write:</p>
<p>&quot;Overall, the taxonomic distribution of the MAG collection corresponded with the profile reported for the same samples using alternative taxonomic classification approaches such as 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing and gene-based taxonomic annotations of the non-binned shotgun contigs</p>

<p>Thank you for your comment and reference.
