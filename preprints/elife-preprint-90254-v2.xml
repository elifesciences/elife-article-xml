<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Despite their importance in a wide range of living organisms, self-cleaving ribozymes in the human genome are few and poorly studied. Here, we performed deep mutational scanning and covariance analysis of two previously proposed self-cleaving ribozymes (LINE-1 and OR4K15). We found that the regions essential for ribozyme activities are made of two short segments, with a total of 35 and 31 nucleotides only. The discovery makes them the simplest known self-cleaving ribozymes. Moreover, the essential regions are circular permutated with two nearly identical catalytic internal loops, supported by two stems of different lengths. These two self-cleaving ribozymes, which shape like lanterns, are similar to the catalytic regions of the twister sister ribozymes in terms of sequence and secondary structure. However, the nucleotides at the cleavage site have shown that mutational effects on the two twister sisterlike (TS-like) ribozymes are different from the twister sister ribozyme. The discovery of TS-like ribozymes reveals a ribozyme class with the simplest and, perhaps, the most primitive structure needed for self-cleavage.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Ribozymes (catalytic RNAs) are thought to have dominated early life forms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>) until they were gradually replaced by more effective and stable proteins. One of the few that remain active is self-cleaving ribozymes found in a wide range of living organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>), involved in rolling circle replication of RNA genomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>), biogenesis of mRNA and circRNA, gene regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>), and co-transcriptional scission of retrotransposons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>).</p>
<p>So far, there are a few self-cleaving ribozymes found in the human genome. They include two hammerhead ribozymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>), a HDV-like cytoplasmic polyadenylation element-binding protein 3 (CPEB3) ribozyme within the transcript of a single-copy gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>), and self-cleaving ribozymes associated with olfactory receptor OR4K15 (olfactory receptor family 4 subfamily K member 15), insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF1R), and a LINE-1 (Long Interspersed Nuclear Element-1) retrotransposon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>). All these ribozymes were discovered by using selection-based biochemical experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>). More recently, the hovlinc ribozyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>) was identified by genome-wide screening against RNAs with the specific 5’-hydroxyl termini resulted from self-cleavage, followed by a combination of RNA structure prediction as well as deletion analysis and mutation-based validation for determining its secondary structure. It has been shown that single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in CPEB3 ribozyme was associated with an enhanced self-cleavage activity along with a poorer episodic memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>). Inhibition of the highly conserved CPEB3 ribozyme could strengthen hippocampal-dependent long-term memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>). However, little is known about the other human self-cleaving ribozymes.</p>
<p>Previous studies on self-cleaving ribozymes found in retrotransposons suggested their importance in the overall size, structure, and function of different genomes. Most selfcleaving ribozymes found in retrotransposons belong to two widespread ribozyme families: HDV-like ribozymes in R2 elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>) and LITc retrotransposon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>) and hammerhead ribozymes (HHR) in short interspersed nuclear elements (SINEs) of Schistosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>), Penelope-like elements (PLEs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>) and retrozymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>). Unlike the wide occurrence of hammerhead ribozymes in different types of retrotransposons, HDV-like ribozymes usually locate in the 5’ UTR region of the retrotransposons only, and were found in different species including <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>), <italic>Bombyx mori</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>), arthropods, nematodes, birds and tunicates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>). These ribozymes are important for co-transcriptional processing of the full-length transcript and translation of the downstream open reading frame (ORF). This suggests that the LINE-1 ribozyme found in the human genome may also play an active role in co-transcriptional processing during evolution.</p>
<p>Typically, self-cleaving ribozymes are in noncoding regions of the genome. For example, the CPEB3 ribozyme is located inside the intron of the CPEB3 gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>), hammerhead ribozyme found in the 3’ UTR of Clec2 genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>), hammerhead and HDV motifs associated with retrotransposable elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>). However, the OR4K15 ribozyme is located at the reverse strand of the coding region of the olfactory receptor gene OR4K15, suggesting a potentially novel functional mechanism for this ribozyme.</p>
<p>Previously, we performed deep mutational scanning of a self-cleaving ribozyme (CPEB3) by using error-prone PCR to generate mutants in large scale. The relative activities of these mutants can be obtained by counting the cleaved and uncleaved sequences of each mutant from high-throughput sequencing data. These activities can be utilized to analyze mutational covariation and infer accurate base-pairing structures by developing a computational tool called CODA (covariation-induced deviation of activity) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>). Here, using the same technique, we located the regions essential for the catalytic activities (the functional regions) of LINE-1 and OR4K15 ribozymes in their original sequences, which were generated from selection of randomly fragmented human genomic DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>). We showed that these two ribozymes shared essentially the same base-pairing structural elements but with a circular permutation. The structural elements, which shaped like the Chinese lantern, are homologous to the catalytic cores of the more complex twister sister self-cleaving ribozymes in terms of sequence and secondary structure, suggesting a more primitive origin for twister sister ribozymes. However, the homology model of twister sister-like (TS-like) ribozyme generated from the twister sister ribozyme may not be the true structure for its function due to the lack of a stem loop for its stabilization and two mismatches from twister sister in the internal loops as well as different responses to mutations.</p>

<title>Deep mutational scanning of LINE-1 and OR4K15 ribozymes.</title>
<p>Our previous work indicates that deep mutational scanning can lead to co-variation signals for highly accurate inference of base-pairing structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>). Here, the same technique was applied to the original LINE-1 ribozyme (146 nucleotides, LINE-l-ori) and OR4K15 ribozyme (140 nucleotides, OR4K15- ori). These original sequences were generated from a randomly fragmented human genomic DNA Selection based biochemical experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>). Thus, their functional and structural regions are unknown. It needs to be noted that there is no exact match for LINE-l-ori and OR4K15-ori in the human genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). This should be related to mutations accumulated during the selection. In deep mutational scanning, high-throughput sequencing can directly measure the relative cleavage activity (RA) (See Methods) of each variant in the mutant libraries of these two ribozymes according to the ratio of cleaved to uncleaved sequence reads of the mutant, relative to the same ratio of the wild-type sequence. The relative activities of single mutations at each position indicate the sensitivity of cleavage activity to the mutations in that position. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> shows the average RA for a given sequence position for all LINE-l-ori mutants with single mutations at the position. Mutations in most positions in LINE-l-ori did not lead to large changes in RA. In other words, these sequence positions are unlikely to contribute to the specific structure required for the ribozyme to be functional. The activity of the LINE-l-ori ribozyme is only sensitive to the mutations in two short segments (54–71 and 83–99) where the RA can be reduced to nearly zero. Thus, the two terminal ends and the central region between bases 72 and 82 are not that important for LINE-1 self-cleaving activity. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, a similar distribution of RA was observed in OR4K15-ori. Only sequence positions inside the two short segments (70–84 and 101–116) are sensitive to mutations, which suggests that only these regions are required to form the functional RNA structure of the OR4K15 selfcleaving ribozyme. Thus, we have identified the contiguous functional regions of LINE-1 ribozymes (54–99, LINE-l-rbz) and OR4K15 ribozymes (70–116, OR4K15-rbz).</p>

<p>The deep mutation data was further employed to search for the base pairs inside these two ribozymes by using CODA analysis. CODA employed Support Vector Regression (SVR) to establish an independent-mutation model and a naive Bayes classifier to separate bases paired from unpaired (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>). Moreover, incorporating Monte-Carlo simulated annealing with an energy model and a CODA scoring term (CODA+MC) could further improve the coverage of the regions under-sampled by deep mutations. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1D and 1E</xref> highlight the base pairs within the region 54–99 of LINE-l-ori (LINE-l-rbz) and the region 70–116 of OR4K15-ori (OR4K15- rbz), respectively. The CODA result for LINE-l-ori shows four base pairs (A14U34, A16U32, G17C31, C18G30) in one possible stem region, and another two base pairs (A4U43, A6A41) in the second possible stem region. Due to the lower mutational coverage, the CODA result for OR4K15-ori shows fewer base pairs than LINE-l-ori. Only two base pairs (U1A47, U3A45) in one possible stem region, and one lone base pair (A13U34) have been observed. The low mutation coverage for OR4K15-ori was due to the mutational bias (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>) of error-prone PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Supplementary Figures S1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">S2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">S3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">S4</xref>).</p>
<p>A few but strong co-variation signals from CODA analysis can be expanded by MC simulated annealing as demonstrated previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>). Several contiguous base-paired regions were detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1D and 1E</xref>). LINE-l-rbz has two highly reliable stem regions with the length of 6 nt, including one non-Watson-Crick pair A6A41. For OR4K15-rbz, the functional region has two reliable stem regions with the lengths of 5 nt and 4 nt, respectively, including one non-Watson-Crick pair G14U33. Most of the base pairs discovered by MC simulated annealing are non-AU pairs, whose covariations are difficult to capture by error-prone PCR because of mutational biases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>). In addition, these two stems are consistent with the single mutation profiles. For example, two single mutations G14A and U33C showed high RA, 1.55 and 1.82, respectively, suggesting the high possibility of a G14U33 pair at these positions, because these two separate mutations change the wobble GU pair to the Watson-Crick AU and GC pairs, respectively, and lead to a more stable structure and higher activity. If G14U33 is true, a natural extension of the stem region is G15C32 for another canonical Watson-Crick pair. This pairing region was missed by the CODA+MC result. There are some other base pairs that appeared in low probabilities after MC simulated annealing. They are considered as false positives because of low probabilities and lack of support from the deep mutational scanning results. The appearance of false positives is likely due to the imperfection of the experiment-based energy function employed in current MC simulated annealing.</p>

<title>Further validation of base pairing information by deep mutational scanning of LINE-1- rbz.</title>
<p>To further improve the signals, we employed the contiguous functional segment (54–99, LINE-l-rbz) for the second round of deep mutational scanning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Supplementary Figure S5</xref>). Performing the second round is necessary because the deep mutational scanning of the original LINE-1 ribozyme has a low 18.5% coverage of double mutations (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>). This low coverage is not sufficient for accurate inference of the secondary structure in the full coverage. This second round employed a chemically synthesized doped library with a doping rate of 6%, rather than a mutant library generated from error-prone PCR biased toward the sequence positions with A/T nucleotide (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Supplementary Tables S1</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">S2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figures S1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">S2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">S3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">S4</xref>). In addition, to amplify the signals of cleaved RNAs after <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription of the mutant library of LINE-l-rbz, we selectively capture cleaved RNAs by employing RtcB ligase and a 5’-desbiotin, 3’-phosphate modified linker because they only react with the 5’-hydroxyl termini that exist only in cleaved RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>). The captured active mutants were further enriched by the streptavidin-based selection after ligation. The technology improvement leads to less biased mutations in terms of the sequence positions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Supplementary Figures S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">S2</xref>) and mutation types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Supplementary Figures S3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">S4</xref>). More importantly, it achieves 99.3% and 99.9% coverage of single and double mutations, respectively, within the contiguous functional segment (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>).</p>

<title>Consistent secondary structure from deep mutational scanning of LINE-l-ori and LINE-l-rbz.</title>
<p>We performed the CODA analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>) based on the relative activities of 45,925 and 72,875 mutation variants (no more than 3 mutations) obtained for the original sequence and functional region of the LINE-1 ribozyme, respectively. CODA detects base pairs by locating the pairs with large covariation-induced deviations of the activity of a double mutant from an independent single-mutation model. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> shows the distribution of relative activity (RA’, measured in the second round of mutational scanning) (See Methods) of all single mutations for the LINE-l-rbz ribozyme, which is consistent with the distribution of RA in the functional region of LINE-l-ori ribozyme (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Supplementary Figure S5</xref>). Moderate or high relative activity values (RA’ &gt; 0.5) at the two outer ends (18C, 30G, C46) of the stem regions suggest that these nucleotides might not be necessary for the function of LINE-l-rbz, whereas RA’ values at 1G were affected by the transcription efficiencies of different nucleotides downstream the T7 promoter.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> shows that data from both the original sequence and functional region of the ribozyme reveal the existence of two stem regions. The latter clearly shows two stems with lengths of 6 nt and 5 nt, respectively, due to nearly 100% coverage of single and double mutations for the functional region. Moreover, it suggests a non-canonical pair 6A41A at the end of the first stem, although the signal is weak. Such a weak signal is expected because the non-canonical pairs are typically less stable than standard base pairings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>). There are some additional weak signals in the LINE-l-rbz result. Most of these signals are for the base pairs at a few sequence distances apart (|i-j|&lt;6, local base pairs). We found that some of them are caused by a high relative activity (RA’) of the double mutant and are not likely to be true positives because the corresponding single mutations are not very disruptive (RA’ &gt; 0.5). The consistency between base pairs inferred from deep mutational scanning of the original sequences and that of the identified functional regions confirmed the correct identification of functional regions for LINE-1 ribozyme.</p>
<p>Probabilistic CODA results were further refined by Monte Carlo simulated annealing (CODA+MC). The resulting base pairs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, upper triangle) removed mostly local false positives. However, the noncanonical AA pair was removed as well, likely because the energy function does not account for noncanonical pairs. A new 18C30G pair added is a natural extension of the second stem. Two separate consecutive base pairs (7G37C, 8C36G) with relatively low signals were also added in the CODA+MC result. These two base pairs are likely false positives because they do not appear in all the models generated from Monte Carlo simulated annealing with a low probability of 0.52. Taking all the information together leads to a confident secondary structure for the LINE-l-rbz ribozyme, which contains two stem regions (Pl, P2), two internal loops, and a stem-loop (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref> left).</p>
<p>The consistent result between LINE-l-rbz and LINE-l-ori suggested that reliable ribozyme structures could be inferred by deep mutational scanning. This allowed us to use OR4K15-ori to directly infer the final inferred secondary structure for the functional region of OR4K15. The secondary structures for these two ribozymes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>) are surprisingly similar to each other. Both ribozymes have two stems (Pl, P2), two internal loops and a stem-loop region. Both stem-loop regions (SL2) are insensitive of ribozyme activity to mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1B, 1C</xref>). The internal loop regions (LI) of LINE-l-rbz and OR4K15-rbz are nearly identical except that C8 in OR4K15-rbz is replaced by U38 in LINE-l-rbz (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>).</p>

<title>Consensus sequence of LINE-l-rbz and OR4K15-rbz.</title>
<p>The consensus sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>) for LINE-l-rbz and OR4K15-rbz were generated by R2R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>) based on the multiple sequence alignment of 1394 and 621 mutants with RA ≥ 0.5 from deep mutational scanning. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref> overlays the consensus sequences onto the secondary structure models from the CODA+MC analysis. The self-cleavage of the two ribozymes occurs between a conserved CA dinucleotide which locates inside the longer part of the internal loops (LI) Unking P1 and P2. The internal loops are the regions with the highest conservation, which suggests their important roles in cleavage activity. Both stem regions (Pl, P2) are not very conserved because of covariations. For example, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref> (right), 1U47A can be replaced by 1C47G, and 14G33U will form 14C33G after double mutations. Covariation of all CG pairs was missing in OR4K15-rbz due to the mutational biases. The stem-loop regions show the lowest sequence identity, consistent with its insensitivity of catalytic activity to mutations in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1B and 1C</xref>, providing additional support for the secondary structure models obtained here.</p>

<title>The secondary structure of OR4K15-rbz is a circular permutation of LINE-l-rbz selfcleaving ribozyme.</title>
<p>Removing the peripheral loop regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1B and 1C</xref>) allows us to recognize that the secondary structure of OR4K15-rbz is a circular permutated version of LINE-l-rbz. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, after a permutation, OR4K15-rbz has two conserved internal loops with one loop identical to LINE-l-rbz and the other loop differed from LINE-l-rbz by one base. The only mismatch U38C in LI has the RA’ of 0.6, suggesting that the mismatch is not disruptive to the functional structure of the ribozyme. As the simplest ribozymes reported so far, it is important to know if these two ribozymes share the same motifs with the known ribozyme families.</p>
<p>Here we used pattern-based similarity search (RNAbob, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://eddylab.org/software.html">http://eddylab.org/software.html</ext-link>) to search the structural patterns against the known ribozyme families in Rfam database (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Supplementary Figure S6</xref>). The structural patterns of two ribozymes were derived from our deep mutational scanning results. We obtained three hits with identical motifs all from the twister sister ribozyme class (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Supplementary Table S3</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> further shows the comparison with two previously published twister sister structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>). The two internal loops of LINE-l-rbz with 5 and 6 nucleotides, respectively, differ from the catalytic internal loops of the four-way junctional twister sister ribozyme only by one base in each loop (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>). Given the identical lantern-shaped regions of the LINE-l-rbz and OR4K15-rbz ribozyme, we named them twister sister-like (TS-like) ribozymes. Thus, it is possible to use the structure of twister sister ribozyme to build a homology model.</p>

<title>Homology modelling of the TS-like ribozymes.</title>
<p>To obtain the structure model of TS-like ribozymes, we used template-based homology modelling with the twister sister ribozyme structure as the template. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> shows the homology modelled structure of bimolecular LINE-1-core (internal loops plus stems) built from the more identical four-way junctional twister sister ribozyme (PDB ID: 5Y87). The structure of the four-way junctional twister sister ribozyme revealed the internal loops LI as the catalytic region involving a guanine-scissile phosphate interaction (G5-C62-A63), continuous stacking interactions, additional pairings and hydrated divalent Mg<sup>2+</sup> ions. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B, 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">Supplementary Figure S7</xref> show that the LINE-1-core model can be built as the twister sister ribozyme in the internal loops LI, with Al 1 at the cleavage site directed inwards. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14">Supplementary Figure S8</xref>, stem Pl of LINE-l-rbz is extended by the Watson-Crick U9A39 as a part of the G7(U9A39) base triple and Watson-Crick C8G40. Meanwhile, stem P2 of LINE-l-rbz is extended through trans non-canonical A12G36 and trans sugar edge-Hoogsteen Al 1C37. In addition to the triple base interaction in LINE-l-rbz, G7 is also H-bonded to both non-bridging O atoms of the phosphate connecting C37 and U38 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). This, along with the H-bond interaction between <italic>proR</italic> O atom of the phosphate and A39 N6, generates a stable square array of H-bonds.</p>

<p>We also modelled the structure of OR4K15-core in the same way as LINE-1-core. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15">Supplementary Figure S9A and S9B</xref>, the model structure of LI in OR4K15-core is similar to LI in the LINE-1-core model, with stems P1 and P2 extended by additional base-pairing interactions in the tertiary structure of OR4K15-core. The base triple interaction of G37(A9U39) also exists in OR4K15-core, with the difference that G37 is H-bonded to A9 N6, rather than U39 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15">Supplementary Figure S9C</xref>). Thus, the square array of H-bonds could not be observed as there was no direct interaction between A9 and the phosphate connecting C7 and C8. This modelling result suggests that the bond between A9 (A39 in LINE-1-core) and the phosphate may not be important, consistent with the fact that the replacement of AU pair by a non-canonical UU pair did not disrupt cleavage activity (RA’ =0.8 for A39U in LINE-l-rbz).</p>
<p>Like the two twister sister ribozyme structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>), the nucleotide U38 in the LINE-1- core model (or C8 in the OR4K15-core model) is extruded from the helix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15">Supplementary Figure S9A</xref>). The corresponding nucleotides, A8 in three-way junctional twister sister ribozyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>) and A7 in four-way junctional twister sister ribozyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>) are involved in the tertiary contact with the stem loop SL4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Lacking the extra stem loops in twister sister ribozyme, the key contacts for U38 of LINE-1-core (C8 in OR4K15-core) are the H-bond interaction with Al 1 N6 (A41 N6 in OR4K15-core), and the interactions between the phosphate and G7 (G37 in OR4K15-core). No involvement of the nucleobase part (U38 in LINE-l-core, C8 in OR4K15-core) in the modelled structures is compatible to the mismatches U38C and U38A found in the comparison, as changes of the nucleobase part did not have a big influence on the H-bonded interactions involving U38 (C8 in OR4K15-core) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Thus, it is not entirely clear whether the model structure of TS-like ribozymes built from twister sister will remain stable in the absence of any tertiary interactions with the stem loop SL2 or it will deviate significantly from the twister sister.</p>

<title>Differences in mutational responses in the Lis between the TS-like and the twister sister ribozymes.</title>
<p>Considering the high similarity of the internal loops, we further investigated the mutational effects on the internal loop Lis. Most nucleotides in the LI region of LINE-l-rbz are relatively conserved, as single mutations showed RA’ &lt; 0.2 according to deep mutational scanning results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). The conservation is consistent with the stacking and hydrogenbonding interactions in the catalytic region. By comparison, mutations of C62 (C54 in three-way junctional twister sister ribozyme) at the cleavage site did not lead a major change on the cleavage activity in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>). This can be compared to the fact that single mutations of the corresponding nucleotide in LINE-l-rbz (CIO) had relative activities as low as 0.07 in the deep mutational scanning result. To further confirm the above result, we performed cleavage assays on several mutations at the cleavage site of LINE-l-core. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, mutations on CIO showed either partial (C10U, C10G) or complete loss (C10A) in cleavage activity. While the corresponding mutations in the four-way junctional twister sister ribozyme showed pronounced (C62U, C62A) or somewhat reduced (C62G) cleavage activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>). More interestingly, A11U in LINE-l-core showed partial cleavage activity, whereas the corresponding mutation A63U in the four-way junctional twister sister ribozyme showed complete loss of cleavage activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>). These different mutation effects indicate that LINE-l-core may not adopt exactly the same structure and catalytic mechanism as twister sister ribozyme. In other words, TS-like ribozymes may not be simply a minimal version of twister sister ribozymes.</p>
<p>We further examined the interactions around the cleavage site C 10-Al 1 in LINE-l-rbz (C40- A41 in OR4K15-core). The corresponding nucleotides in twister sister ribozymes (C62-A63 in four-way junctional twister sister ribozyme, C54-A55 in three-way junctional twister sister ribozyme) adopt either a splayed-apart or a base-stacked conformation, with the scissile phosphate H-bonded to the G5 (four-way junctional twister sister ribozyme) or C7 (three-way junctional twister sister ribozyme). In our modelled structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15">Supplementary Figure S9D</xref>), the bases at the cleavage site CIO-All in LINE-l-core (C40-A41 in OR4K15- core) are splayed away, with All (A41 in OR4K15-core) directed inwards and CIO (C40 in OR4K15-core) directed outwards. In addition, H-bonded interactions between CIO (C40 in OR4K15-core) and the two nucleotides 3’ of CIO could be found (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15">Supplementary Figure S9D</xref>). These structure differences may partially explain why mutations of CIO were detrimental to the catalysis in TS-like ribozymes. Moreover, we did not observe interactions between CIO (C40 in OR4K15-core) and G36/C37 (G6/C7 in OR4K15-core) although they were important to anchor the cytosine in twister sister ribozymes. This may be due to replacement of the non-canonical pair G5U64 (G6U57 in three-way junctional twister sister ribozyme) by A12G36 (G6A42 in OR4K15-core) in TS-like ribozymes. Thus, the stability of the current model structure based on the template from twister sister is uncertain.</p>

<title>Activity confinnation and biochemical analysis of LINE-l-core and OR4K15-core.</title>
<p>To confirm the cleavage activity of the core region (without the stem-loop linker), we obtained the segments (54–71 for LINE-1, 101–116 for OR4K15) as the substrate strands with the cleavage site and the segments (83–99 for LINE-1, 70–84 for OR4K15) as the enzyme strands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>), as they made up the LINE-l-core and OR4K15-core. When the substrate strand was mixed with the enzyme strand, most of the substrate strand was cleaved in the presence of Mg<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). When Mg<sup>2+</sup> was not included in the reaction, no cleavage could be observed even after 24h’s incubation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig16">Supplementary Figure S10</xref>).

<p>The core constructs of the two TS-like ribozymes contain 35 and 31 nucleotides, respectively. They are the simplest and the second simplest self-cleaving ribozymes reported so far. In all previously reported self-cleaving ribozyme families, the self-cleaving reaction occurs through an internal phosphoester transfer mechanism, in which the 2’-hydroxyl group of the -1 (relative to the cleavage site) nucleotide attacks the adjacent phosphorus resulting in the release of the 5’ oxygen of+1 (relative to the cleavage site) nucleotide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>). We confirmed that both LINE-l-core and OR4K15-core employed the same cleavage mechanism because the analogous RNAs that lacked the 2’ oxygen atom in the -1 nucleotide (dClO for LINE-l-core, dC40 for OR4K15-core) were unable to cleave (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). We also investigated whether TS-like ribozymes can cleave when Mg<sup>2+</sup> was replaced by Co(NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>6</sub><sup>3+</sup> in the reaction. Co(NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>6</sub><sup>3+</sup> is isosteric with Mg(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>6</sub><sup>2+</sup>, but the divalent cations cannot directly participate in catalysis as the amino ligands cannot readily dissociate. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, a total loss of cleavage activity in Co(NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>6</sub><sup>3+</sup> in the absence of Mg<sup>2+</sup> indicates that the TS-like ribozymes require the binding of divalent cations not only for structure folding, but also for catalysis.</p>
<p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>, we further examined the dependence of the metal ions on TS-like ribozymes’ cleavage activity. At a concentration of ImM, ribozyme cleavage can be observed with Mg<sup>2+</sup>, Mn<sup>2+</sup>, Co<sup>2+</sup> and Zn<sup>2+</sup> but little or none with Ca<sup>2+</sup>, Cu<sup>2+</sup>, Ba<sup>2+</sup>, Ni<sup>2+</sup>, Na<sup>+</sup>, K<sup>+</sup>, Li<sup>+</sup>, Cs<sup>+</sup> or Rb<sup>+</sup>, indicating that direct participation of specific hydrated divalent metal ions is required for self-cleavage. More interestingly, we found that the TS-like ribozymes have an equivalent or even higher cleavage ratio with Mn<sup>2+</sup> than Mg<sup>2+</sup>. For LINE-l-core, the cleaved fractions were ~57% for Mg<sup>2+</sup>, ~74% for Mn<sup>2+</sup>. For OR4K15-core, the cleaved fractions were ~9% for Mg<sup>2+</sup>, ~79% for Mn<sup>2+</sup>. We further characterized the cleavage rates of these two ribozymes under different concentrations of Mg<sup>2+</sup> and Mn<sup>2+</sup> by using a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based method, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig17">Supplementary Figure S11</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig18">Figure S12</xref>. We used the first-order rate constant (k<sub>obs</sub>) to represent the efficiency of the cleavage reaction. The k<sub>obs</sub> of LINE-l-core under single-turnover condition was ~0.05 min<sup>1</sup> when measured in lOrnM MgCl<sub>2</sub> and 100mM KCl at pH 7.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig19">Figure S13</xref>). Only a slightly lower value of k<sub>obs</sub> (~0.03 min<sup>-1</sup>) was observed for LINE-l-rbz (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig20">Figure S14</xref>). This confirms that the stem loop region SL2 does not contribute much to the cleavage activity of the TS-like ribozymes. Cleavage activities of the two TS-like ribozymes were highly dependent on the concentration of divalent metal ions. The steep increase in rate constants of two TS-like ribozymes plateaued at Mg<sup>2+</sup> concentrations above 100mM, while for Mn<sup>2+</sup> it plateaued at concentrations of 10mM. Consistent with the PAGE result, LINE-l-core showed higher cleavage rates than OR4K15- core when they were incubated with Mg<sup>2+</sup>. However, the cleavage rates of OR4K15-core were only lower than LINE-l-core when the concentrations of Mn<sup>2+</sup> were less than 20mM, but higher, otherwise. Thus, there may exist important difference between OR4K15-core and LINE-l-core to explain this different bias toward ions. A detailed explanation for this difference may require high-resolution structure determination of the TS-like ribozymes.</p>

<title>Homology search of two TS-like ribozymes.</title>
<p>To locate close homologs of the two TS-like ribozymes, we performed cmsearch based on a covariance model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>) built on the sequence and secondary structural profiles. In the human genome, we got 1154 and 4 homolog sequences for LINE-l-rbz and OR4K15-rbz, respectively. For OR4K15-rbz, there was an exact match located at the reverse strand of the exon of OR4K15 gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). The other 3 homologs of OR4K15-rbz belongs to the same olfactory receptor family 4 subfamily K (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). However, there was no exact match for LINE-l-rbz (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Interestingly, a total of 1154 LINE-l-rbz homologs were mapped to the LINE-1 retrotransposon according to the RepeatMasker (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.repeatmasker.org">http://www.repeatmasker.org</ext-link>) annotation. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref> showed the distribution of LINE-l-rbz homologs in different LINE-1 subfamilies in the human genome. Only three subfamilies L1PA7, L1PA8 and L1P3 (L1PA7-9) can be considered as abundant with LINE-l-rbz homologs (&gt;100 homologs per family). The consensus sequences of all homologs obtained are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>. In order to investigate the self-cleavage activity of these homologs, we mainly focused on the mismatches in the more conserved internal loops. The major differences between the 5 consensus sequences are the mismatches in the first internal loop. The widespread A12C substitution can be found in majority of LINE-l-rbz homologs, this substitution leads to a one-base pair extension of the second stem (P2) but almost no activity (RA’: 0.03) based on our deep mutational scanning result. Then we selected 3 homologs without A12C substitution for LINE-l-rbz for in vitro cleavage assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). But we didn’t observe significant cleavage activity, this might be caused by GU substitutions in the stem region. For 3 homologs of OR4K15-rbz, we only found one homolog of OR4K15 with pronounced self-cleavage activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). In addition, we performed similar bioinformatic search of the TS-like ribozymes in other primate genomes. Similarly, the majority (15 out of 18) of primate genomes have a large number of LINE-1 homologs (&gt;500) and the remaining three have essentially none. However, there was no exact match. Only one homolog has a single mutation (U38C) in the genome assembly of Gibbon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig21">Figure S15</xref>). The majority of these homologs have 3 or more mismatches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig21">Figure S15</xref>). For OR4K15-rbz, all representative primate genomes contain at least one exact match of the OR4K15-rbz sequence.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The wide distribution of RNA self-cleaving activity in different species suggest that selfcleaving ribozymes play an important role in living organisms. Most self-cleaving ribozymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>) are in non-coding regions of the hosting genome. For example, the CPEB3 ribozyme in the intron of the CPEB3 gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>), hammerhead ribozyme in the 3’ UTR of Clec2 genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>), hammerhead and HDV motifs associated with retrotransposons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>). LINE-1 belongs to the family of retrotransposons, they make up about 17% of the human genome, with over 500,000 copies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>). The retrotransposition process of LINE-1 increases the copy number of repeats and generates insertional mutations in the genome, which contributes to the genetic novelties as well as genomic instability. However, we found that the LINE-l-rbz sequence shared at least two mismatches with the ancient human LINE-1 families, that led to the loss of self-cleavage activity. Considering the location of the LINE-1 ribozyme inside the 5’ UTR, it is suggested that this ribozyme might be related to the transcriptional regulation of the LINE-1 retrotransposon during evolution, like the HDV-like ribozymes. By comparison, the OR4K15 ribozyme is located at the reverse strand of the coding region of the olfactory receptor gene OR4K15, suggesting a potentially novel functional mechanism for this ribozyme as antisense transcription has been shown to be ubiquitous in mammals and may affect the gene regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>). However, the progress on understanding the functional roles of LINE-1 and OR4K15 self-cleaving ribozymes was slow because of lacking structural clues.</p>
<p>The centerpiece of structural clues is the RNA base-pairing structure resulted from the complex interplay of secondary and tertiary interactions. Previously, we developed a technique (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>) for inferring the base-pairing information of the self-cleaving ribozymes by deep mutational scanning. In this paper, we applied this technique to the LINE-1 and OR4K15 ribozymes, to obtain the functional regions and the base-pairing information. As both LINE-1 and OR4K15 ribozymes were discovered from the randomly fragmented human genomic DNA selection based biochemical experiments, the original full-length (WT) sequences of the ribozymes do not necessarily represent the functional region of the RNAs. However, the functional regions can cleave when they were transcribed along with the upstream and downstream sequences, and, thus, they are more likely to be active in cellular environment.</p>
<p>Indeed, we found that the functional regions for both ribozymes are very short (35 and 31 nucleotides for LINE-1 and OR4K15, respectively) and surprisingly in the same class in a circular permutated form. We are confident about the secondary structures obtained because of the consistency between the results from the deep mutational study of the original sequence and the functional region of the LINE-1 ribozyme. The obtained secondary structure is further confirmed by the discovery of the functional regions of the two TS-like ribozymes in the circular permutated form from one another (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). From the mutational information of LINE-l-rbz, the only mismatch (U38C) from OR4K15 in the catalytic region has the RA’ of 0.6. While the corresponding mismatch mutation C8U in OR4K15 has the RA of 1.54, or 0.65 for U8C. This consistence in activity reduction for the U-→C mutation further confirmed that these two ribozymes belong to the same class in a circular permutated form. Currently, three classes of self-cleaving ribozymes, the hammerhead (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>—<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>), twister (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>) and the hairpin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>) ribozymes are found in different species in multiple circular permutated forms. The discovery of permutated TS-like ribozymes in the human genome for the first time suggests that we can find additional examples of circular permutated TS-like ribozymes in other species.</p>
<p>More interestingly, we found that the internal loop regions of the TS-like ribozymes share a high similarity with the known catalytic region of the twister sister ribozyme (2 mismatches only, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). The conserved cleavage sites suggest a similar structure and mechanism as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>. However, the maximum observed rate constant (k<sub>obs</sub>) for twister sister ribozyme was ~5 min<sup>-1</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>), compared to ~0.ll ± 0.01min<sup>1</sup> for the TS-like ribozymes. This rate difference is not mainly caused by mismatches in the catalytic core between the twister sister and LINE-1/OR4K15 ribozymes. In fact, deep mutational scanning results indicate that one mismatch (U38C) in the catalytic region of OR4K15-rbz (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) has the RA’ of 0.6. Two mismatches (A12U and U38A) in the catalytic region of the twister sister ribozyme (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) have the RA’ of 0.28 and 0.47, respectively, whereas the coexistence of these two mismatches only has the RA’ of 0.09. Thus, a more sophisticated structure along with long-range interactions involving the SL4 region in the twister sister ribozyme must have helped to stabilize the catalytic region for the improved catalytic activity. Similarly, previous studies have demonstrated that peripheral regions of hammerhead (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>), hairpin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>) and HDV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>) ribozymes could greatly increase their self-cleavage activity. Given the importance of the peripheral regions, absence of this tertiary interaction in the TS-like ribozyme may not be able to fully stabilize the structural form generated from homology modelling.</p>
<p>Indeed, we found some differences between the responses to mutations in the catalytic regions around the cleavage sites of TS-like ribozymes and those of twister sister ribozymes. Although there are pronounced differences around the cleavage sites in previous twister sister ribozyme structures, both cytosines at the cleavage sites were found to be insensitive to mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>). However, unlike twister sister ribozymes, the cytosine at the cleavage site of TS-like ribozyme was sensitive to mutations in our mutation assays. According to our modelled structures, the H-bonding interactions associated with the cleavage site C10-A11 (C40-A41 in OR4K15-core) in TS-like ribozymes show that the cytosine (CIO in LINE-l-core, C40 in OR4K15) is relatively conserved, which is consistent with the mutation assay results. In the modelled structure, we did not observe direct contacts helped to stabilize the scissile phosphate and the in-line alignments required for the catalytic step. This may suggest that conformational changes may be required to generate the active conformation prior to the catalytic step as in the twister sister ribozyme structures. Or this is due to inexact structures generated from homology modelling, because Mg<sup>2+</sup> was not included during homology modelling. Our experimental results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B-D</xref>) showed that Mg<sup>2+</sup> is essential for both structure folding and catalysis. Absence of Mg<sup>2+</sup> during modelling might lead to the conformational change of the tertiary structures. Thus, further studies are clearly needed to illustrate possible structural and mechanistic difference between TS-like ribozymes and twister sister ribozyme.</p>
<p>According to the bioinformatic analysis result, there are some TS-like ribozymes (one LINE-1-rbz homolog in the Gibbon genome, and some OR4K15-rbz homologs) with in vitro cleavage activity in primate genomes. Unlike the more conserved CPEB3 ribozyme which has a clear function, the function of the TS-like ribozymes is not clear, as they are not conserved, belong to the pseudogene or located at the reverse strand. While the <italic>in vivo</italic> activities and functions of these two circular-permutated TS-like ribozymes require further studies, their discovery may have important therapeutics and biotech implications. First, the TS-like ribozymes have the simplest secondary structure with two stems and two internal loops, compared to all naturally occurring self-cleaving ribozymes. Previous studies also have revealed some minimized forms of self-cleaving ribozymes, including hammerhead (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>) and HDV-like (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>) ribozymes. However, when comparing the conserved segments, they (&gt;= 36 nt) are not as short as the TS-like ribozymes (31 nt) found here. Second, this TS-like ribozyme after removing the stem-loop region only requires a 15-nucleotide enzyme strand and a 16-nucleotide substrate strand for its function. Thus, it can be easily modified into a trans-cleaving ribozyme, which was found useful for bioengineering and RNA-targeting therapeutics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref>). A recent intracellular selectionbased study has shown that hammerhead ribozyme can be engineered into a trans-acting ribozyme with consistent gene knockdown ability on different targeted mRNA either in prokaryotic or eukaryotic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref>). The TS-like ribozyme, the simplest one known, may have an unprecedented advantage, compared to existing trans-cleaving ribozymes.</p>
<p>What is also important is that this work further confirms the usefulness of deep mutational scanning and high-throughput sequencing for RNA structural inference by CODA analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref>). The method is not limited to self-cleaving ribozymes, if combined with other functional or phenotypic selection techniques. Moreover, the structural and full mutational information provided by this method could be utilized to discover additional functional RNAs and thus help us to investigate the hidden side of non-coding RNAs.</p>

<title>Deep mutational scanning and CODA analysis on the functional region of LINE-1 ribozyme</title>
<p>We identified the functional region of the LINE-1 ribozyme (labelled as LINE-l-rbz) by removing the terminal sequence positions whose mutations do not affect cleavage activities. Then, the second round of deep mutational scanning experiment was applied to the LINE-l-rbz. Here, we used a doped mutation library instead of a library generated by error-prone PCR. The doped mutant library Rz_LINE-l_doped (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl4">Supplementary Table S4</xref>) was amplified by using primer T7prom and M13F (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl4">Supplementary Table S4</xref>). The PCR product was then gel-purified, quantified, and diluted. Approximately 5 × 10<sup>5</sup> doped DNA molecules were amplified by T7prom and M13F primers (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl4">Supplementary Table S4</xref>) to produce enough DNA template for in vitro transcription. The transcribed and purified RNAs (10 pmol) of the mutant library were mixed with 100 pmol rM13R_5desBio_3P (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl4">Supplementary Table S4</xref>), 2 μl 10X RtcB reaction buffer (New England Biolabs), 2 μl 1mM GTP, 2 μl 10mM MnCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.2 μl of Murine RNase Inhibitor (40 U/μl, New England Biolabs) and 1 μl RtcB RNA ligase (New England Biolabs) to a total volume of 20 μl. The reaction mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 1 h, then purified using RNA Clean &amp; Concentrator-5 kit (Zymo Research). The purified products were mixed with 2 μl of 10 μl M RT_ml3f_ adp1 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl4">Supplementary Table S4</xref>) and 1 μl of 10mM dNTPs in a volume of 8 μl, and then heated to 65 °C for 5min and placed on ice. Reverse transcription was initiated by adding 4 μl of 5x ProtoScript II Buffer (New England Biolabs), 2 μl of 0.1 M DTT, 0.2 μl of Murine RNase Inhibitor (40 U/pl, New England Biolabs) and 1 μl ProtoScript II RT (200 U/μl, New England Biolabs) to a total volume of 20 μl. The reaction mixture was incubated at 42°C for 1 h, and then purified by Sera-Mag Magnetic Streptavidin-coated particles (Thermo Scientific).</p>
<p>The purified products after streptavidin-based selection were amplified by PCR to construct the RNA-seq library with primer P7R2_ml3r and P5Rl_ml3f (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl4">Supplementary Table S4</xref>). The DNA template used for transcription was used as the template for constructing the DNA-seq library with primer P5Rl_ml3f and P7R2_t7p (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl4">Supplementary Table S4</xref>). The DNA-seq and RNA-seq libraries were also sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq X sequencer with 25% PhiX control by Novogene Technology Co., Ltd. Raw paired-end sequencing reads were filtered and then merged by using the bioinformatic tool PEAR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref>) to generate the high-quality merged reads. We counted the read number of each variant in DNA-seq and RNA-seq by mapping the barcode. Then, we estimated the relative activity (RA’) of each variant by using the equation <italic>RA’(var) = N<sub>RNAseq</sub>(var)N<sub>DNAseq</sub>(wt)/N<sub>DNAseq</sub>(var)N<sub>RNAseq</sub>(wt).</italic></p>
<p>This relative activity (RA’) measure is different from the relative activity (RA) when both cleaved and uncleaved sequences were obtained in RNA-seq in the first-round deep mutational scanning. However, it should be a good estimate of RA because a mutant with a higher activity (cleavage rate) should have a higher possibility to be captured by RtcB ligase. We confirmed RA’ as a good estimate of RA by comparing shared single mutations from LINE-l-ori and LINE-l-rbz and obtained a strong Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.66 (Spearman correlation coefficient of 0.769). Moreover, both RA and RA’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>) show that the central region of LINE-l-rbz is insensitive to mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Supplementary Figure S5</xref>). Moreover, secondary structures derived from RA’ and RA are consistent with each other (see below), confirming the correct identification of structural and functional regions of LINE-1 ribozyme.</p>
<p>We used the same method CODA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>) to analyze the RA’ of LINE-l-rbz. For Monte Carlo (MC) simulated annealing, we used the same weighting factor of 2.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The overall analysis and discovery of the common motif is important and exciting. Very few human/primate ribozymes have been published and this manuscript presents a detailed analysis of two of them. The minimized domains appear to be some of the smallest known self-cleaving ribozymes.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The manuscript is rooted in deep mutational analysis of the human OR4K15 and LINE1 ribozymes and subsequently in modeling of their active site based on the closely-related core of the TS ribozyme. The experiments support the HTS findings and provide convincing evidence that the ribozymes are structurally related to the core of the TS ribozyme, which has not been found in primates prior to this work.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The overall analysis and discovery of the common motif are important and exciting. Very few human/primate ribozymes have been published and this manuscript presents a relatively detailed analysis of two of them. The minimized domains appear to be some of the smallest known self-cleaving ribozymes.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The manuscript is rooted in deep mutational analysis of the OR4K15 and LINE1 and subsequently in modeling of a huge active site based on the closely-related core of the TS ribozyme. The experiments support the HTS findings and provide convincing evidence that the ribozymes are structurally related to the core of the TS ribozyme, which has not been found in primates prior to this work.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) Given that these two ribozymes have not been described outside of a single figure in a Science Supplement, it is important to show their locations in the human genome, present their sequence and structure conservation among various species, particularly primates, and test and discuss the activity of variants found in non-human organisms. Furthermore, OR4K15 exists in three copies on three separate chromosomes in the human genome, with slight variations in the ribozyme sequence. All three of these variants should be tested experimentally and their activity should be presented. A similar analysis should be presented for the naturally-occurring variants of the LINE1 ribozyme. These data are a rich source for comparison with the deep mutagenesis presented here. Inserting a figure (1) that would show the genomic locations, directions, and conservation of these ribozymes and discussing them in light of this new presentation would greatly improve the manuscript. As for the biological roles of known self-cleaving ribozymes in humans, there is a bioRxiv manuscript on the role of the CPEB3 ribozyme in mammalian memory formation (doi.org/10.1101/2023.06.07.543953), and an analysis of the CPEB3 functional conservation throughout mammals (Bendixsen et al. MBE 2021). Furthermore, the authors missed two papers that presented the discovery of human hammerhead ribozymes that reside in introns (by de la PeÃ{plus minus}a and Breaker), which should also be cited. On the other hand, the Clec ribozyme was only found in rodents and not primates and is thus not a human ribozyme and should be noted as such.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank this Reviewer for his/her input and acknowledgment of this work. To improve the manuscript, we have included the genomic locations in Figure 1A, Figure 6A and Figure 6C. And we have tested the activity of representative variants found in the human genome and discussed the activity of the variants in other primates. All suggested publications are now properly cited.</p>
<p>Line 62-66: It has been shown that single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in CPEB3 ribozyme was associated with an enhanced self-cleavage activity along with a poorer episodic memory (14). Inhibition of the highly conserved CPEB3 ribozyme could strengthen hippocampal-dependent long-term memory (15, 16). However, little is known about the other human self-cleaving ribozymes.</p>
<p>Line 474-501: Homology search of two TS-like ribozymes. To locate close homologs of the two TS-like ribozymes, we performed cmsearch based on a covariance model (38) built on the sequence and secondary structural profiles. In the human genome, we got 1154 and 4 homolog sequences for LINE-1-rbz and OR4K15-rbz, respectively. For OR4K15-rbz, there was an exact match located at the reverse strand of the exon of OR4K15 gene (Figure 6A). The other 3 homologs of OR4K15-rbz belongs to the same olfactory receptor family 4 subfamily K (Figure 6C). However, there was no exact match for LINE-1-rbz (Figure 6A). Interestingly, a total of 1154 LINE-1-rbz homologs were mapped to the LINE-1 retrotransposon according to the RepeatMasker (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.repeatmasker.org">http://www.repeatmasker.org</ext-link>) annotation. Figure 6B showed the distribution of LINE-1-rbz homologs in different LINE-1 subfamilies in the human genome. Only three subfamilies L1PA7, L1PA8 and L1P3 (L1PA7-9) can be considered as abundant with LINE-1-rbz homologs (&gt;100 homologs per family). The consensus sequences of all homologs obtained are shown in Figure 6D. In order to investigate the self-cleavage activity of these homologs, we mainly focused on the mismatches in the more conserved internal loops. The major differences between the 5 consensus sequences are the mismatches in the first internal loop. The widespread A12C substitution can be found in majority of LINE-1-rbz homologs, this substitution leads to a one-base pair extension of the second stem (P2) but almost no activity (RA’: 0.03) based on our deep mutational scanning result. Then we selected 3 homologs without A12C substitution for LINE-1-rbz for in vitro cleavage assay (Figure 6E). But we didn’t observe significant cleavage activity, this might be caused by GU substitutions in the stem region. For 3 homologs of OR4K15-rbz, we only found one homolog of OR4K15 with pronounced self-cleavage activity (Figure 6F). In addition, we performed similar bioinformatic search of the TS-like ribozymes in other primate genomes. Similarly, the majority (15 out of 18) of primate genomes have a large number of LINE-1 homologs (&gt;500) and the remaining three have essentially none. However, there was no exact match. Only one homolog has a single mutation (U38C) in the genome assembly of Gibbon (Figure S15). The majority of these homologs have 3 or more mismatches (Figure S15). For OR4K15-rbz, all representative primate genomes contain at least one exact match of the OR4K15-rbz sequence.</p>
<p>Line 598-602: According to the bioinformatic analysis result, there are some TS-like ribozymes (one LINE-1-rbz homolog in the Gibbon genome, and some OR4K15-rbz homologs) with in vitro cleavage activity in primate genomes. Unlike the more conserved CPEB3 ribozyme which has a clear function, the function of the TS-like ribozymes is not clear, as they are not conserved, belong to the pseudogene or located at the reverse strand.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) The authors present the story as a discovery of a new RNA catalytic motif. This is unfounded. As the authors point out, the catalytic domain is very similar to the Twister Sister (or &quot;TS&quot;) ribozyme. In fact, there is no appreciable difference between these and TS ribozymes, except for the missing peripheral domains. For example, the env33 sequence in the Weinberg et al. 2015 NCB paper shows the same sequences in the catalytic core as the LINE1 ribozyme, making the LINE1 ribozyme a TS-like ribozyme in every way, except for the missing peripheral domains. Thus these are not new ribozymes and should not have a new name. A more appropriate name should be TS-like or TS-min ribozymes. Renaming the ribozymes to lanterns is misleading.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Although we observed some differences in mutational effects, we agree with the reviewer that it is more appropriate to call them TS-like ribozymes. We have replaced all “lantern ribozyme” with “TS-like ribozyme” as suggested.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) In light of 2) the story should be refocused on the fact the authors discovered that the OR4K15 and LINE1 are both TS-like ribozymes. That is very exciting and is the real contribution of this work to the field.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank this Reviewer for their acknowledgement of this work. To improve the manuscript, we have re-named the ribozymes as suggested.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) Given the slow self-scission of the OR4K15 and LINE1 ribozymes, the discussion of the minimal domains should be focused on the role of peripheral domains in full-length TS ribozymes. Peripheral domains have been shown to greatly speed up hammerhead, HDV, and hairpin ribozymes. This is an opportunity to show that the TS ribozymes can do the same and the authors should discuss the contribution of peripheral domains to the ribozyme structure and activity. There is extensive literature on the contribution of a tertiary contact on the speed of self-scission in hammerhead ribozymes, in hairpin ribozyme it's centered on the 4-way junction vs 2-way junction structure, and in HDVs the contribution is through the stability of the J1/2 region, where the stability of the peripheral domain can be directly translated to the catalytic enhancement of the ribozymes.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate your question and the valuable suggestions provided. We have included the citations and discussion about the peripheral domains in other ribozymes.</p>
<p>Line 570-576: Thus, a more sophisticated structure along with long-range interactions involving the SL4 region in the twister sister ribozyme must have helped to stabilize the catalytic region for the improved catalytic activity. Similarly, previous studies have demonstrated that peripheral regions of hammerhead (49), hairpin (50) and HDV (51, 52) ribozymes could greatly increase their self-cleavage activity. Given the importance of the peripheral regions, absence of this tertiary interaction in the TS-like ribozyme may not be able to fully stabilize the structural form generated from homology modelling.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) The argument that these are the smallest self-cleaving ribozymes is debatable. LÃ1/4nse et al (NAR 2017) found some very small hammerhead ribozymes that are smaller than those presented here, but the authors suggest only working as dimers. The human ribozymes described here should be analyzed for dimerization as well (e.g., by native gel analysis) particularly because the authors suggest that there are no peripheral domains that stabilize the fold. Furthermore, Riccitelli et al. (Biochemistry) minimized the HDV-like ribozymes and found some in metagenomic sequences that are about the same size as the ones presented here. Both of these papers should be cited and discussed.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We apologize for any confusion caused by our previous statement. To clarify, we highlighted “35 and 31 nucleotides only” because 46 and 47 nt contain the variable hairpin loops which are not important for the catalytic activity. By comparing the conserved segments, the TS-like ribozyme discussed in this paper is the shortest with the simplest secondary structure. And we have replaced the terms “smallest” and “shortest” with “simplest” in our manuscript. The title has been changed to “Minimal twister sister (TS)-like self-cleaving ribozymes in the human genome revealed by deep mutational scanning”. All the publications mentioned have been cited and discussed. Regarding possible dimerization, we did not find any evidence but would defer it to future detailed structural analysis to be sure.</p>
<p>Line 605-608: Previous studies also have revealed some minimized forms of self-cleaving ribozymes, including hammerhead (19, 53) and HDV-like (54) ribozymes. However, when comparing the conserved segments, they (&gt;= 36 nt) are not as short as the TS-like ribozymes (31 nt) found here.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(6) The authors present homology modeling of the OR4K15 and LINE1 ribozymes based on the crystal structures of the TS ribozymes. This is another point that supports the fact that these are not new ribozyme motifs. Furthermore, the homology model should be carefully discussed as a model and not a structure. In many places in the text and the supplement, the models are presented as real structures. The wording should be changed to carefully state that these are models based on sequence similarity to TS ribozymes. Fig 3 would benefit from showing the corresponding structures of the TS ribozymes.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for pointing these out and we have already fixed them. We have replaced all “lantern ribozyme” with “TS-like ribozyme” as suggested. The term “Modelled structures” were used for representing the homology model. And we have included the TS ribozyme structure in Fig 3.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This manuscript applies a mutational scanning analysis to identify the secondary structure of two previously suggested self-cleaving ribozyme candidates in the human genome. Through this analysis, minimal structured and conserved regions with imminent importance for the ribozyme's activity are suggested and further biochemical evidence for cleavage activity are presented. Additionally, the study reveals a close resemblance of these human ribozyme candidates to the known self-cleaving ribozyme class of twister sister RNAs. Despite the high conservation of the catalytic core between these RNAs, it is suggested that the human ribozyme examples constitute a new ribozyme class. Evidence for this however is not conclusive.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The deep mutational scanning performed in this study allowed the elucidation of important regions within the proposed LINE-1 and OR4K15 ribozyme sequences. Part of the ribozyme sequences could be assigned a secondary structure supported by covariation and highly conserved nucleotides were uncovered. This enabled the identification of LINE-1 and OR4K15 core regions that are in essence identical to previously described twister sister self-cleaving RNAs.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>I am skeptical of the claim that the described catalytic RNAs are indeed a new ribozyme class. The studied LINE-1 and OR4K15 ribozymes share striking features with the known twister sister ribozyme class (e.g. Figure 3A) and where there are differences they could be explained by having tested only a partial sequence of the full RNA motif. It appears plausible, that not the entire &quot;functional region&quot; was captured and experimentally assessed by the authors.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank this Reviewer for his/her input and acknowledgment of this work. Because a similar question was raised by reviewer 1, we decided to name the ribozymes as TS-like ribozymes. Regarding the entire regions, we conducted mutational scanning experiments at the beginning of this study. The relative activity distributions (Figure 1B, 1C) have shown that only parts of the sequence contributes to the self-cleavage activity. That is the reason why we decided to focus on the parts of the sequence afterwards.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>They identify three twister sister ribozymes by pattern-based similarity searches using RNA-Bob. Also comparing the consensus sequence of the relevant region in twister sister and the two ribozymes in this paper underlines the striking similarity between these RNAs. Given that the authors only assessed partial sequences of LINE-1 and OR4K15, I find it highly plausible that further accessory sequences have been missed that would clearly reveal that &quot;lantern ribozymes&quot; actually belong to the twister sister ribozyme class. This is also the reason I do not find the modeled structural data and biochemical data results convincing, as the differences observed could always be due to some accessory sequences and parts of the ribozyme structure that are missing.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the reviewer for raising this question. As we explained in the last question, we now called the ribozymes as TS-like ribozymes. We also emphasize that the relative activity data of the original sequences have indicated that the other part did not make any contribution to the activity of the ribozyme. The original sequences provided in the Science paper (Salehi-Ashtiani et al. Science 2006) were generated from biochemical selection of the genomic library. It did not investigate the contribution of each position to the self-cleavage activity.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Highly conserved nucleotides in the catalytic core, the need for direct contacts to divalent metal ions for catalysis, the preference of Mn2+ oder Mg2+ for cleavage, the plateau in observed rate constants at ~100mM Mg2+, are all characteristics that are identical between the proposed lantern ribozymes and the known twister sister class.</p>
<p>The difference in cleavage speed between twister sister (~5 min-1) and proposed lantern ribozymes could be due to experimental set-up (true single-turnover kinetics?) or could be explained by testing LINE-1 or OR4K15 ribozymes without needed accessory sequences. In the case of the minimal hammerhead ribozyme, it has been previously observed that missing important tertiary contacts can lead to drastically reduced cleavage speeds.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for this question. We now called the ribozymes as TS-like ribozymes. As we explained in the last question, the relative activity data of the original sequences have proven that the other part did not make any contribution to the activity of the ribozyme. Moreover, we have tested different enzyme to substrate ratios to achieve single turn-over kinetics (Figure S13). The difference in cleavage speed should be related to the absence of peripheral regions which do not exist in the original sequences of the LINE-1 and OR4K15 ribozyme. We have included the publications and discussion about the peripheral domains in other ribozymes.</p>
<p>Line 458-463: The kobs of LINE-1-core was ~0.05 min-1 when measured in 10mM MgCl2 and 100mM KCl at pH 7.5 (Figure S13). Furthermore, the single-stranded ribozymes exhibited lower kobs (~0.03 min-1 for LINE-1-rbz) (Figure S14) when comparing with the bimolecular constructs. This confirms that the stem loop region SL2 does not contribute much to the cleavage activity of the TS-like ribozymes.</p>
<p>Line 570-576: Thus, a more sophisticated structure along with long-range interactions involving the SL4 region in the twister sister ribozyme must have helped to stabilize the catalytic region for the improved catalytic activity. Similarly, previous studies have demonstrated that peripheral regions of hammerhead (49), hairpin (50) and HDV (51, 52) ribozymes could greatly increase their self-cleavage activity. Given the importance of the peripheral regions, absence of this tertiary interaction in the TS-like ribozyme may not be able to fully stabilize the structural form generated from homology modelling.</p>

<p>Abstract:</p>
<p>It is claimed that ribozyme regions of 46 and 47 nt described in the manuscript resemble the shortest known self-cleaving ribozymes. This is not correct. In 1988, hammerhead ribozymes in newts were first discovered that are only 40 nt long.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We apologize for any confusion caused by our previous statement. To clarify, we highlighted “35 and 31 nucleotides only” as 46 and 47 nt contain the variable hairpin loops which are not important for the catalytic activity. By comparing the conserved segments, the TS-like ribozyme discussed in this paper is the shortest with the simplest secondary structure. And we have replaced the terms “smallest” and “shortest” with “simplest” in our manuscript. The title has been changed to “Minimal TS-like self-cleaving ribozyme revealed by deep mutational scanning”.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The term &quot;functional region&quot; is, to my knowledge, not a set term when discussing ribozymes. Does it refer to the catalytic core, the cleavage site, the acid and base involved in cleavage, or all, or something else? Therefore, the term should be 1) defined upon its first use in the manuscript and 2) probably not be used in the abstract to avoid confusion to the reader.</p>

<p>We apologize for any confusion caused by our previous statement. To clarify, we have changed the term “functional region” in abstract. And we have defined the use of “functional region” in introduction.</p>
<p>Line 34-37: We found that the regions essential for ribozyme activities are made of two short segments, with a total of 35 and 31 nucleotides only. The discovery makes them the simplest known self-cleaving ribozymes. Moreover, the essential regions are circular permutated with two nearly identical catalytic internal loops, supported by two stems of different lengths.</p>

<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The choice of the term &quot;non-functional loop&quot; in the abstract is a bit unfortunate. The loop might not be important for promoting ribozyme catalysis by directly providing, e.g. the acid or base, but it has important structural functions in the natural RNA as part of a hairpin structure.</p>

<p>We thank the reviewer for pointing this out. According to the original Science paper (Salehi-Ashtiani et al. Science 2006), the human genomic DNA (isolated from whole blood) was purchased from Clontech (Cat. 6550-1).

<p>For OR4K15 it is stated that the deep mutational scanning only revealed two short regions as important. However, there is another region between approx. 124-131 nt and possibly even at positions 47 and 52 (to ~55), that could contribute to effective RNA cleavage, especially given the library design flaws (see below) and the lower mutational coverage for OR4K15. A possible correlation of the mutations in these regions is even visible in the CODA+MC analysis shown in Figure 1D on the left. Why are these regions ignored in ongoing experiments?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for this question. As shown in Table S1, although the double mutation coverage of OR4K15-ori was low (16.2 %), we got 97.6 % coverage of single mutations. The relative activity of these single mutations was enough to identify the conserved regions in this ribozyme. Mutations at the positions mentioned by the reviewer did not lead to large reductions in relative activity. Since the relative activity of the original sequence is 1, we presumed that only positions with average relative activity much lower than 1 might contribute to effective cleavage.</p>
<p>Regarding the corresponding correlation of mutations in CODA+MC, they are considered as false positives generated from Monte Carlo simulated annealing (MC), because lack of support from the relative activity results.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Have the authors performed experiments with their &quot;functional regions&quot; in comparison to the full-length RNA or partial truncations of the full-length RNA that included, in the case of OR4K15, nt 47-131? Also for LINE-1 another stem region was mentioned (positions 14-18 with 30-34) and two additional base pairs. Were they included in experiments not shown as part of this manuscript?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the reviewer for raising this question. We only compared the full-length or partial truncations of the LINE-1 ribozyme. Since the secondary structure predicted from OR4K15-ori data was almost the same as LINE-1, we didn’t perform deep mutagenesis on the partial truncation of the OR4K15. However, the secondary structure of OR4K15 was confirmed by further biochemical experiments.</p>
<p>Regarding the second question, the additional base pairs were generated by Monte Carlo simulated annealing (MC). They are considered as false positives because of low probabilities and lack of support from the deep mutational scanning results. The appearance of false positives is likely due to the imperfection of the experiment-based energy function employed in current MC simulated annealing.</p>

<p>What are the reasons the authors assume their findings from LINE-1 can be used to directly infer the structure for OR4K15? (Third section in results, last paragraph)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We apologize for any confusion caused by our previous statement. We meant to say that the consistency between LINE-1-rbz and LINE-1-ori results suggested that our method for inferring ribozyme structure was reliable. Thus, we employed the same method to infer the structure of the functional region of OR4K15. To clarify, we have re-phrased the sentence.</p>
<p>Line 259-261: The consistent result between LINE-1-rbz and LINE-1-ori suggested that reliable ribozyme structures could be inferred by deep mutational scanning. This allowed us to use OR4K15-ori to directly infer the final inferred secondary structure for the functional region of OR4K15.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>There are several occasions where the authors use the differences between the proposed lantern ribozymes and twister sister data as reasons to declare LINE-1 and OR4K15 a new ribozyme class. As mentioned previously, I am not convinced these differences in structure and biochemical results could not simply result from testing incomplete LINE-1 and OR4K15 sequences.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We apologize for any confusion caused by our previous statement. Despite we observed some differences in mutational effects, we agree with the reviewer that it is not convincing to claim them as a new ribozyme class. We have replaced all “lantern ribozyme” with “TS-like ribozyme” as the reviewer 1 suggested.</p>

<p>The authors state, that &quot;the result confirmed that the stem loop SL2 region in LINE-1 and OR4K15 did not participate in the catalytic activity&quot;. To draw such a conclusion a kinetic comparison between a construct that contains SL2 and does not contain SL2 would be necessary. The given data does not suffice to come to this conclusion.</p>

<p>We appreciate the reviewer for raising this question. To address this, we performed gel-based kinetic analysis of these two ribozymes (Figure S14).</p>

Only a slightly lower value of  kobs (~0.03 min-1) was observed for LINE-1-rbz (Figure S14). This confirms that the stem loop region SL2 does not contribute to the cleavage activity of the TS-like ribozymes.</p>

<p>Construct/Library design:</p>
<p>The last 31 bp in the OR4K15 ribozyme template sequence are duplicated (Supplementary Table 4). Therefore, there are 2 M13 fwd binding sites and several possible primer annealing sites present in this template. This could explain the lower yield for the mutational analysis experiments. Did the authors observe double bands in their PCR and subsequent analysis? The experiments should probably be repeated with a template that does not contain this duplication. Alternatively, the authors should explain, why this template design was chosen for OR4K15.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We apologize for this mistake during writing. Our construct design for OR4K15 contains only one M13F binding site. We thank the reviewer for pointing this out and we have fixed the error.</p>

<p>The authors investigated ribozyme cleavage speeds by measuring the observed rate constants under single-turnover conditions. To achieve single-turnover conditions enzyme has to be used in excess over substrate. Usually, the ratios reported in the literature range between 20:1 (from the authors citation list e.g.: for twister sister (Roth et al 2014) and hatchet (Li et al. 2015)) or even ~100:1 (for pistol: Harris et al 2015, or others <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0014579305002061">https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0014579305002061</ext-link>). Can the authors please share their experimental evidence that only 5:1 excess of enzyme over the substrate as used in their experiments truly creates single-turnover conditions?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We greatly appreciate the Reviewer for raising this question. To address this, we performed kinetic analysis using different enzyme to substrate ratios (Figure S13). There is not too much difference in kobs, except that kobs reach the highest value of 0.048 min-1 when using 100:1 excess of enzyme over the substrate.</p>

<p>The statement on the difference between C8 in OR4K15 and U38 in LINE-1 should be further classified. As U38 is only 95% conserved. Is it a C in those other instances or do all other nucleotide possibilities occur? Is the high conservation in OR4K15 an &quot;artifact&quot; of the low mutation rate for this RNA in the deep mutational scanning?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for this question. Yes, the high conservation in OR4K15 an &quot;artifact&quot; of the low mutation rate for this RNA in the deep mutational scanning. That is why RA’ value is more appropriate to describe the conservation level of each position. We also mentioned this in the manuscript:</p>

<p>We thank the reviewer for this question. We purposely used two fluorophores (5’ 6-FAM, 3’ TAMRA) to show the two product bands in Figure 5.
