<title>Abstract</title><p>Rapid and high local calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) signals are essential for triggering neurotransmitter release from presynaptic terminals. In specialized bipolar ribbon synapses of the retina, these local Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals control multiple processes, including the priming, docking, and translocation of vesicles on the ribbon before exocytosis, endocytosis, and the replenishment of release-ready vesicles to the fusion sites for sustained neurotransmission. However, our knowledge about Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals along the axis of the ribbon active zone is limited. Here, we used fast confocal quantitative dual-color ratiometric line-scan imaging of a fluorescently labeled ribbon binding peptide and Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicators to monitor the spatial and temporal aspects of Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients of individual ribbon active zones in zebrafish retinal rod bipolar cells (RBCs). We observed that a Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient elicited a much greater fluorescence amplitude when the Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator was conjugated to a ribeye-binding peptide than when using a soluble Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator, and the estimated Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels at the ribbon active zone exceeded 26 Î¼M in response to a 10-millisecond stimulus, as measured by a ribbon-bound low-affinity Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator. Our quantitative modeling of Ca<sup>2+</sup> diffusion and buffering is consistent with this estimate and provides a detailed view of the spatiotemporal [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] dynamics near the ribbon. Importantly, our data demonstrates that the local Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels may vary between ribbons of different RBCs and within the same cells. The variation in local Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals is correlated to ribbon size, which in turn correlates with active zone extent, as serial electron microscopy provides new information about the heterogeneity in ribbon size, shape, and area of the ribbon in contact with the plasma membrane.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Sensory synapses in the retina rely on the proper function of a specialized organelle, the synaptic ribbon <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. Retinal bipolar cells serve as the major conduit for transmitting visual information across the vertebrate retina. Rod bipolar cells (RBCs) can release brief bursts of neurotransmitters to signal a change in contrast or sustain the continuous release of neurotransmitters in a graded manner to provide an analog read-out of luminance <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>. To maintain this ability, the RBCs must exert dynamic control over neurotransmitter release rate and facilitate efficient recruitment of release-ready vesicles to fusion sites near the synaptic ribbon. It is established that the elevation of presynaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup> in RBCs regulates both dynamic changes in the release rate and accelerates the rate of vesicle replacement <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>. However, the spatiotemporal properties of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals that control neurotransmitter release and the molecular entities that regulate the interplay between Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals and synaptic vesicle dynamics to sustain kinetically distinct neurotransmitter release components remain poorly understood. Here, we begin to address this lack of knowledge by measuring local Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals at positions along the synaptic ribbon at different distances from the active zone in retinal RBCs.</p>
<p>Resolving local Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals is technically challenging as it requires information about the spatiotemporal properties of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals specific to ribbon sites. Previous studies of Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics in goldfish and mammalian RBCs focused primarily on the terminal as a whole and used quantitative methods to examine bulk Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels, which are significantly lower and slower than those occurring at the active zone <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. Our previous studies estimated that the Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals at a single ribbon active zone in zebrafish RBCs likely exceed sub-micromolar concentration level within 3 milliseconds after the opening of voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> (Cav) channels <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. However, these studies were based on estimates using soluble Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicators to estimate the Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals at the plasma membrane, which are free to diffuse and thus cause the spread of the signal. Measurements of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals along the axis of the ribbon have not been attempted, even though these signals likely control replenishment and priming of vesicles for slower phases of neurotransmitter release. To determine Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals along the axis of zebrafish RBC ribbons, we establish a nanophysiology ratiometric approach that measures the spatial and temporal properties of Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients by targeting the Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator to the ribbon via conjugation to a ribbon binding peptide (RBP) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. Resolving Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals in the immediate vicinity of the active zone is not currently possible due to the finite spatiotemporal resolution of optical imaging. Thus, we employ a quantitative model using Ca<sup>2+</sup> diffusion and buffering to resolve the RBC Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals associated with the active zone and along the ribbon and provide a detailed description of the spatiotemporal Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics across zebrafish RBC ribbons. Our nanophysiology approach for measuring local Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients at a single ribbon with high spatiotemporal resolution provides the first evidence of heterogeneity of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals at zebrafish RBC ribbon synapses.</p>

<title>Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations at single ribbon locations measured using high- and low-affinity diffusible indicators</title>
<p>Synaptic vesicles in RBCs are distributed among at least four distinct pools based on their fusion kinetics, which are assumed to reflect the average proximity of vesicles to Cav channels and the state of vesicle preparedness for Ca<sup>2+</sup>-triggered fusion <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup> (see Supplementary Fig. 1). To visualize and measure Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals near the RBC synaptic ribbon controlling such kinetically distinct components of neurotransmitter release, we established a quantitative nanophysiology approach shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.1</xref> (see also <italic>Materials and Methods</italic>). In this approach, both the ribbon location and the spatiotemporal Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal profile were simultaneously measured by dialyzing the zebrafish RBC terminals with both TAMRA (tetramethyl rhodamine)-labeled RIBEYE-binding peptide (RBP) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup> (to label synaptic ribbons; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1Ai</xref>) and a high-affinity Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator Cal-520<sup>Â®</sup> (Cal520HA, effective <italic>K<sub>D</sub></italic> 795 nM; see <italic>Materials and Methods</italic>) using a whole-cell patch pipette placed directly at the cell terminal. A rapid x-t line scan was taken perpendicular to the plasma membrane across a ribbon, extending from the extracellular space to the cytoplasmic region beyond the ribbon (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1Aii</xref>). The spatial resolution was limited by the point spread function (PSF) of the microscope to approximately 270 nm (Supplementary Fig.2A). In our previous studies, line scans have been applied primarily to measure the temporal properties of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. However, x-t raster plots obtained at a ribbon active zone labeled with RBP allow us to characterize the spatial localization of Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients relative to the synaptic ribbon and plasma membrane (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.1C-D</xref>) in addition to characterizing its temporal aspects (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.1E-F</xref>). We previously used a similar approach for localizing and tracking single synaptic vesicles before and during fusion at a single ribbon <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>, and to measure the kinetics of clearance of fused synaptic vesicle membrane in zebrafish RBC <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>. We found that depolarization-evoked Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx caused a rapid increase in Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals at ribbon locations (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.1C</xref><bold>, cyan, white horizontal arrowhead</bold>) and increased more slowly and less dramatically in the cytoplasm (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.1C</xref><bold>, cyan, white vertical arrow</bold>) in zebrafish RBC. The Sigmoid-Gaussian function fitting of the x-t scans horizontal profile scans (see <italic>Materials and Methods</italic>) show that the local Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals increased rapidly during stimuli (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.1D</xref>, cyan line) and then decreased immediately after the end of depolarization (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.1D</xref>, black lines) approaching the spatial profile corresponding to the resting Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.1D</xref>, gray lines). As expected, the centroid position of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals during depolarization (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.1D</xref><bold>, cyan</bold> x<sub>0</sub>) is closer to the plasma membrane (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.1D</xref><bold>, magenta</bold> x<sub>1/2</sub>) than the centroid position of RBP (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.1D</xref><bold> magenta,</bold> x<sub>0</sub>), since Cav channels are located at the membrane <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>.</p>

The outside of the cell is to the right, and x-t scan lines (dotted lines) were positioned perpendicular to the plasma membrane, extending from the intracellular side of the ribbon to the extracellular space. A rapid x-t line scan was taken at a ribbon location perpendicular to the plasma membrane across a ribbon (<bold>Aii</bold>) with sequential dual laser scanning performed at rates of 1.51 milliseconds per line per channel (3.02 milliseconds per line for both channels). The resulting x-t raster plots were used to measure the fluorescence intensity profiles of RBP (magenta) and the Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient (cyan; Cal520HA) shown in panels <bold>C</bold> and <bold>E</bold>.

<p>To characterize the temporal Ca<sup>2+</sup> profile at different distances from the plasma membrane, we analyzed the x-t line scans along the time-axis at three distinct distances (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E-F</xref>) based on the spatial profile of the ribbon described in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.1C-D</xref> (see also <italic>Materials and Methods</italic>). We will refer to the corresponding three measurements as <italic>ribbon-proximal</italic>, <italic>ribbon-distal</italic>, and <italic>cytoplasmic</italic> (see <italic>Materials and Methods</italic>). We found that at the onset of the stimulus (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F</xref>, black arrow), the fluorescence at the location near the ribbon proximal to the membrane (ribbon-proximal) rose more rapidly and to a higher level (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F</xref>, light cyan trace) than that at the ribbon-distal and cytoplasmic locations (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F</xref>, dark cyan, and gray trace). To quantify the kinetics of ribbon-proximal and distal CaÂ²âº signals, we averaged multiple x-t scans acquired with Cal520HA under the same imaging conditions (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). The rise time of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals produced in response to brief 10 milliseconds stimuli, defined here as the time for the averaged Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient measured with Cal520HA to reach half-maximal peak fluorescence amplitude from the resting level (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>), is faster for the proximal (â¼2.81 milliseconds) than distal (â¼3.44 millisecond) signals (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). The corresponding maximum values of trial-averaged Î<italic>F</italic>/<italic>F</italic><sub>rest</sub> (changes in the Cal520HA fluorescence during depolarization normalized to background level before depolarization) was significantly higher at ribbon-proximal locations (nearest the Cav channels) than those at ribbon-distal locations, with mean Â± SEM of 1.9 Â± 0.3 and 1.5 Â± 0.25, respectively (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>; p&lt; 0.001, N=24; 95% confidence limit). These findings suggest that the spatial resolution of our Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging using Cal520HA is sufficient to resolve differences in the smaller Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals at ribbon proximal and distal locations.</p>

<p>Since Cal520HA will be saturated at the Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels expected in Ca<sup>2+</sup> microdomains relevant for vesicle exocytosis <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>, we repeated the x-t line scan analysis with a lower-affinity soluble Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator Cal520LA (<italic>K<sub>D</sub></italic> 90 Î¼M; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>) allowing us to better define the typical Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals controlling distinct neurotransmitter release components corresponding to locations proximal and distal relative to the synaptic ribbon (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>). We found that the ribbon-proximal signals detected with Cal520LA (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>, light cyan) showed a sharper rise and decay at the onset and termination of the stimulus (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>, black arrow), when compared to ribbon-distal signals (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>, dark cyan), as one would expect for nanodomain Ca<sup>2+</sup> elevations <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup>. The relationship between rise times for the proximal (4.58 millisecond) and distal (7.10 millisecond) signals were similar to those we found with Cal520HA, with both proximal Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals being faster than the distal signals. In twenty-one similar experiments, the peak Î<italic>F</italic>/<italic>F</italic><sub>rest</sub> at the membrane after 10-ms depolarization was significantly larger for proximal than distal signals (Î<italic>F</italic>/<italic>F</italic><sub>rest</sub>: 3.1 Â± 0.4 and 1.9 Â± 0.2 respectively P=0.001, N= 21, 95% confidence limit).

Diffusible CaÂ²âº indicators report space-averaged CaÂ²âº concentrations, and their intracellular diffusion inherently broadens the spatial resolution of CaÂ²âº nanodomains. To partially overcome this problem, we targeted the Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicators to the ribbon by fusing them to the RBP, as described previously <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. RBP-conjugated Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicators Cal520HA-RBP or Cal520LA-RBP were introduced to the RBC terminal together with fluorescently labeled RBP via whole-cell voltage clamp by placing the patch pipette directly at the terminal while imaging the terminal using laser scanning confocal microscopy. For two-color imaging, ribbons were labeled with TAMRA-RBP that did not interfere with Cal520-RBP fluorescence, and both channels were scanned sequentially to prevent possible bleed-through. Under these conditions, we used the spots detected by TAMRA-RBP to define the locus of the synaptic ribbon (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3A</xref><bold>&amp;B, magenta</bold>). We also found punctate regions with both Cal520HA-RBP (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3A</xref><bold>, cyan</bold>) and Cal520LA-RBP (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3B</xref><bold>, cyan</bold>) at the same location, on a dimmer fluorescent background of the synaptic terminal, which correspond to the Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator-peptide complexes that are bound and not bound to the ribbon, respectively <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>.

Our data shows that the amplitude differences between ribbon-proximal and ribbon-distal Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals were well resolvable using the ribbon-bound Cal520HA-RBP indicator (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>, light vs. dark cyan traces: Î<italic>F</italic>/<italic>F</italic><sub>rest</sub> = 3 Â± 0.4 vs. 1.9 Â± 0.3, respectively, p=0.001) and Cal520LA-RBP indicator (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>, light vs. dark cyan traces: Î<italic>F</italic>/<italic>F</italic><sub>rest</sub> = 5.5 Â± 0.9 vs. 3.3 Â± 0.8, respectively, p=0.003).

<p>This method also enables ratiometric measurements with RBP-conjugated Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator by normalizing its fluorescence to that of RBP-peptides conjugated to Ca<sup>2+</sup>-insensitive fluorophores (TAMRA-RBP) to provide an estimate of Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration in RBC synaptic ribbons. We obtained the effective <italic>K<sub>1/2</sub></italic> (<italic>K</italic><sub>eff</sub>) by measuring the Cal520HA-RBP/ TAMRA-RBP fluorescence ratio in buffered Ca<sup>2+</sup> solutions and using the Grynkiewicz equation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref></sup>. For Cal520HA-RBP, we found the <italic>K</italic><sub>eff</sub> to be â¼795 nM, which is higher than the value of 320 nM reported by the manufacturer for Cal520HA. The differences between the in-cell measurements and the manufacturerâs values are likely to arise from differences in the cellular buffering capabilities, changes in dye properties due to interactions with the molecules inside the cell <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref></sup>, and possible differences in the binding properties of the peptide-conjugated Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicators when bound to synaptic ribbons. Since the in-cell approach most closely matched the experimental conditions, we used this value (<italic>K</italic><sub>eff</sub>) for all further calculations.</p>
<p>We first measured the ribbon-proximal and ribbon-distal Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations using Cal520HA-RBP with 0.2 mM EGTA in the patch pipette as it allowed to resolve the gradient between the two signals (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>). Under these conditions, we found a maximum ribbon-proximal Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration produced in response to a brief 10-ms pulse of 3.7 ÂµM, and a maximum ribbon-distal Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration of 0.7 ÂµM. These <italic>apparent</italic> CaÂ²âº concentration amplitudes are well below levels required to trigger exocytosis of the ultrafast releasable pool (UFRP) and readily releasable pool (RRP) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup> and, as discussed earlier, likely represent the lower bounds of the CaÂ²âº concentration at a single ribbon location due to local saturation of the high-affinity indicator and/or due to nanodomains that are smaller than the resolution attainable using light microscopy. It should also be noted that unlike freely diffusing Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicators, RBP-conjugated indicators that slowly unbind from the ribbon are not readily replaced by free Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicators, rendering them even more prone to saturation. Nevertheless, our data demonstrate that ribbon-bound indicators may better report local Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations due to their localization, albeit still subject to the limitations of light microscopy.</p>
<p>To test the contribution of local saturation and to better estimate ribbon Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations, we repeated our measurements using the low-affinity Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator Cal520LA conjugated to the RBP peptide. Because it was difficult to perform in-cell measurements to determine the <italic>K</italic><sub>eff</sub> for Cal520LA-RBP given the large amounts of Ca<sup>2+</sup> required to calibrate the Cal 520LA indicator (see <italic>Methods and Materials</italic>), we used the <italic>K<sub>1/2</sub> value</italic> provided by the manufacturer for free Cal520LA (90 ÂµM). However, we expect that in-cell measurements of <italic>K</italic><sub>eff,</sub> are likely to be different due to the cellular buffering properties reported previously for <italic>K</italic><sub>eff,</sub> measurements of Oregon Green BAPTA-5N in inner hair cells <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Bipolar cells release neurotransmitters primarily from ribbon active zones, although some release also occurs at non-ribbon sites (referred to as NR, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref></sup>. To reveal the Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling at and away from the ribbon, we performed whole-cell patch clamping and x-t line scans at ribbon (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4Ba</xref>, R) and non-ribbon (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4Bb</xref>, NR) sites perpendicular to the plasma membrane using TAMRA-RBP and Cal520LA-RBP. A brief (10-ms) depolarizing voltage-clamp pulse evoked rapid high Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4Ba</xref>, cyan raster plot) at ribbon locations (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4Ba</xref>, magenta raster plot) but not at non-ribbon locations (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4Bb</xref>, cyan raster plot). The amplitude of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals elicited by brief depolarization and detected with Cal520LA-RBP at the ribbon-proximal site (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>, light cyan traces) were significantly higher than those at ribbon-distal (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>, dark cyan traces) and non-ribbon (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>, blue traces) sites. The Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration gradient along the ribbon is summarized in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref>. We found that the average Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration at the proximal side of the ribbon (26.4 Â± 3.1 ÂµM, n=26) was significantly different from that at the ribbon-distal (15.6 Â± 1.5 ÂµM, n=26) and non-ribbon (10.4 Â± 0.4 ÂµM, n=15) sites, and that Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations at ribbon-distal sites is higher than those at non-ribbon sites (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref>). These measurements display large heterogeneity across distinct ribbons and distinct cells, with the coefficient of variation of about 60% for [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] measurements at locations proximal to the ribbon, compared to a 10% CV for multiple depolarizations for the same ribbon. The Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals at distal sites also reached their peak amplitude earlier (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref> <italic>inset</italic>, dark cyan arrowhead) than those at the non-ribbon sites (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref> <italic>inset</italic>, blue arrowhead). These findings are consistent with non-ribbon vesicle release being governed by cytoplasmic residual Ca<sup>2+</sup> or Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx via clustered Cav channels at ribbon sites rather than non-ribbon active zones with clusters of Cav channels and are also in agreement with previous reports regarding the temporal delay and sensitivity of non-ribbon exocytosis to EGTA <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref></sup>.</p>

<title>Sensitivity of microdomain Ca<sup>2+</sup> to exogenous buffers</title>
<p>Previous work has shown that the rate of vesicle replacement in RBCs is accelerated by elevated Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels at sites along the ribbon, and that while millimolar levels of EGTA have little effect on the fast exocytosis component near Cav channels, they selectively block sustained exocytosis, likely by preventing Ca<sup>2+</sup> from reaching the distal locations on the ribbon <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref></sup>. These findings raise the possibility that Ca<sup>2+</sup> has two sites of action, one near the Cav channels that trigger vesicle release and one further away that replenishes the supply of releasable vesicles. Burrone <italic>et al.</italic> (2002) proposed that endogenous Ca<sup>2+</sup> buffers regulate the size of the RRP by limiting the spatial spread of Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions and could suppress vesicle release at the periphery of the active zone in bipolar cells <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. However, the Ca<sup>2+</sup> gradient at different locations along the ribbon controlling RRP release has never been examined. Thus, we used our nanophysiology approach (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.1</xref>) to measure the Ca<sup>2+</sup> gradient along the synaptic ribbon under buffering conditions that differentially modulate vesicle release and resupply. To determine the spatiotemporal properties of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals under these conditions, we performed rapid x-t line scans at a single ribbon location in the presence of ribbon-bound Cal520LA-RBP and under varying concentrations of exogenous buffer in the patch pipette solution, including (EGTA at 0.2 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>), 2 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>), and 10 mM (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>) or BAPTA at 2 mM (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D</xref>)). We found that the ratio between proximal and distal Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal amplitudes was similar in 0.2 and 2 mM EGTA (proximal-to-distal ratio â¼1.7, Supplementary Table 1) but was enhanced with 10 mM EGTA (proximal-to-distal ratio â¼1.9, Supplementary Table 1) and further enhanced with 2 mM BAPTA (proximal-to-distal ratio â¼4.5, Supplementary Table 1). These findings once again emphasize the reliable measurement of resolving ribbon-proximal vs. ribbon distal Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals using our nano-physiology approach. Our experimental findings of the increase in the proximal-to-distal Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration ratio with increasing EGTA concentration are consistent with our simulation results (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>), although the corresponding ratios are greater in the simulation than in the experiment due to the large size of the microscopeâs point-spread function.</p>

<p>Though BAPTA significantly abolished the spread of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals, it is impressive that a substantial amount of ribbon-proximal Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration measured with ribbon-bound indicators was still present with 2 mM BAPTA. One reason for this observation could be that ribbon-bound Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicators are likely to measure Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals very close to Cav channels without diffusing away, which makes it impossible for BAPTA to intercept Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions. If so, similar experiments conducted with free Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicators should report a significantly lower proximal Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal since the measurement by a diffusible dye would effectively spread the signal over a larger volume. Indeed, this is what we found. As shown in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5E</xref>, the apparent proximal Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal in response to a 10-ms brief pulse measured with Cal520LA-free in the presence of 2 mM BAPTA was 0.9 Â± 0.2 (n=9), 4-fold lower than proximal Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals measured with Cal520LA-RBP (3.6 Â± 1, n=20). The latter value is closer to the true measure of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration in the vicinity of the ribbon base. These findings emphasize that the reliable measurement of ribbon-proximal Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals in the vicinity of Cav channels greatly benefits from the increased spatial resolution of our nano-physiology approach. We also measured the spatiotemporal properties of local Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals using Cal520HA-RBP as we have done above for Cal520LA-RBP (Supplementary Fig. 3). We found that the ratio between proximal and distal Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals was similar in 0.2 and 2 mM EGTA (proximal-to-distal ratio â¼1.5, Supplementary Table 2) but was enhanced with 10 mM EGTA (proximal-to-distal ratio â¼2.6, Supplementary Table 2) and further enhanced with 2 mM BAPTA (proximal-to-distal ratio â¼2.8, Supplementary Table 2). Cal520 acts as a buffer that binds Ca<sup>2+</sup> and carries it away by diffusion. Thus, the higher affinity indicator Cal520HA will bind and shuttle away more Ca<sup>2+</sup> than Cal520LA. If the Cal520HA indicator is saturated near the Cav channels, it may be underreporting the fast Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients that occur in those locations. However, Cal520 LA and Cal520 HA show similar increase in the ribbon proximal-to-distal ratios with increasing concentrations of exogenous buffer.</p>

<title>Computational models of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals along the axis of the RBC synaptic ribbon</title>
<p>Since we could identify the position of the ribbon and we used RBP-fused Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator-RBP, we were able to measure and distinguish ribbon-proximal vs. ribbon-distal Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals that drive the release of UFRP and RRP. However, several factors, including finite spatiotemporal resolution of optical imaging, spatial diffusion, dye saturation, and dye binding kinetics, may limit our ability to achieve optimal resolution. These limitations, however, can be overcome by the use of quantitative models. Thus, we developed a model based on our data with published information on Ca<sup>2+</sup> diffusion and buffering to estimate more accurately the [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>I</sub> gradient along the ribbon at distinct distances from the plasma membrane.</p>
    <p>Combining whole-terminal Ca<sup>2+</sup> current measurements and our estimate for the number of synaptic ribbons per terminal allowed us to infer the magnitude of Ca<sup>2+</sup> current per single ribbon, which we used in our model to determine the spatiotemporal [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] dynamics near the ribbon. <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref> shows the results of the simulation of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] at various distances from the ribbon during and after a depolarizing pulse of 10ms duration in the presence of different concentrations of exogenous and endogenous buffers, replicating the conditions used in our experiments. The geometry of the simulation domain box is shown in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>; it represents the fraction of total synaptic terminal volume per single ribbon (see <italic>Methods</italic>, Supplementary Table 3 and Supplementary Fig.4A.). <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref> shows the time-dependence of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] during and after the depolarization pulse at 5 specific locations both near and distant from the ribbon (left-hand panels in each subplot). These five spatial locations are marked by circles of different colors in the right-hand panel of each subplot, which shows [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] at the end of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> current pulse in pseudo-color in the entire planar cross-section of the simulation domain cutting through the middle of the ribbon, as shown in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>. We assumed a highly simplified Cav channel arrangement into four clusters forming a square with a side length of 80nm. The closest of the five spatial locations (red curves and circles in <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>) is X=20 nm away from the base of the ribbon center-line, Z=10 nm above the ribbon, about 45nm away from the closest Cav channel cluster (see <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>). We assumed that this location was within the Ca<sup>2+</sup> microdomain that triggered the release of the UFRP. Vesicles were not included in the simulation since the total exclusion volume attributed to them represented only a small fraction of the total inter-terminal volume and, therefore, did not significantly impact [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] at the qualitative resolution level we are interested in. A couple of simulations with vesicles included were performed to confirm this statement, requiring much finer spatial resolution and longer computational time. We note also that [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] for short pulse durations considered here is relatively insensitive to our assumptions on the membrane Ca<sup>2+</sup> extrusion mechanisms, listed in Supplementary Table 3.</p>

<p><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7A</xref><bold>1-B2</bold> reveals that [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] could rise above 50 ÂµM within the microdomain near the base of the ribbon in the presence of 0.2 mM up to 10 mM EGTA. Given the size of the microscope point-spread function, this is in qualitative agreement with the 26 Î¼M estimate of ribbon-proximal [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] that we recorded using the ribeye-bound low-affinity indicator. In addition, this concentration level is reached very soon after the channel opening event due to the rapid formation of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> microdomain <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">73</xref></sup>, and therefore, this estimate is expected to hold for shorter pulses as well. However, [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] decayed rapidly with distance, with the rate of decay significantly increasing when EGTA concentration was increased to 10mM (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7B</xref><bold>1, B2</bold>). Note that a 7-fold change in the capacity of the immobile endogenous Ca<sup>2+</sup> buffer (cf. <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7A</xref><bold>1 vs. 7A2</bold>) had a relatively modest effect on the [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] level up to about 150 nm distance from the ribbon base. This effect of increasing endogenous buffer concentration was further reduced in 10 mM EGTA (cf. <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7B</xref><bold>1 vs. 7B2</bold>), due to strong competition of endogenous buffer with large concentrations of EGTA. This agrees with the expectation that immobile buffers primarily slow down Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals but do not affect the rapidly forming quasi-steady-state Ca<sup>2+</sup> microdomains in the immediate vicinity of the channel <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">74</xref></sup>. Finally, <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7C</xref><bold>1-C2</bold> shows that 2 mM BAPTA had a much greater effect on localizing the Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal to the immediate vicinity of the ribbon base.</p>
<p>Since a native unpatched cell may well contain mobile rather than immobile buffers, it was interesting to examine the effect of increasing the concentration of mobile endogenous buffer on Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics in the ribbon vicinity, as compared to the corresponding effect of immobile buffer. Supplemental Figure 4B-C shows that a 7-fold increase in mobile buffer concentration reduces the microdomain Ca<sup>2+</sup> by a factor of 2 and greatly reduces the size of the microdomain. This contrasts with the effect of increasing the concentration of the immobile buffer, which has a much more subtle effect (cf. <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7A</xref><bold>1, A2</bold>). We note that 0.2 mM EGTA was absent in the simulation with mobile buffer shown in Supplemental Figure 4B-C; in general, the effect of modest concentrations of EGTA is expected to be negligible due to its slow Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding speed compared to the endogenous buffer.</p>

<title>Variability of local Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals across the RBC synaptic ribbons</title>
<p>Bipolar cells release neurotransmitters primarily from ribbon active zones <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>. However, the factors that shape the synaptic ribbon microdomains at retinal ribbon synapses have not been examined. We wondered whether all of the 30â¼50 synaptic ribbons at an RBC terminal release glutamate in a similar fashion or whether there is some heterogeneity in glutamate release from different ribbon active zones. In particular, we asked what underlying mechanisms could differentiate the Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals between ribbons of the same RBC terminal and across different RBCs. We first found evidence for such variability in local Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals at single-ribbon locations of different cells using the freely diffusible high-affinity indicator Cal520HA, observing in particular high variability of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient amplitudes, even for RBCs with similar depolarization-evoked Ca<sup>2+</sup> current amplitudes (cf. Supplementary Figs. 5A vs. 5B. However, we did not observe such variability when we obtained multiple line scans across the same ribbon (Supplementary Figs. 5A vs. 5B, gray traces). We wondered whether the observed variability between cells could be due to distinct subtypes of zebrafish RBCs <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup>, which might have different subtypes or numbers of Cav channels near the ribbon. Recent work in zebrafish retina identified two distinct RBC subtypes: RBC1 and RBC2 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup>. The wiring pattern of amacrine cells postsynaptic to RBC1 closely resembles the circuitry of mammalian RBCs, whereas RBC2 forms distinct pathways. Furthermore, RBC1 specifically labels for the known marker of mammalian RBCs, PKC-Î± <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup>. Due to these similarities, RBC1 in zebrafish is classified as analogous to mammalian RBCs. Moreover, RBC1s have expected morphological characteristics, in particular, the shape and size of soma and the presence of a single synaptic terminal <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup>. Immunolabeling of isolated RBC preparation used in these experiments showed primarily intact RBCs, which are PKC-Î±-specific RBC1 (Supplementary Fig. 2B). For simplicity, and because this study focuses exclusively on RBC1, we will refer to RBC1 as âRBCâ throughout this work. Thus, we attribute the variability in the RBC Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients to the variability between the Ca<sup>2+</sup> microdomains within the same cell type.</p>
<p>To identify mechanisms that contribute to the heterogeneity in the local Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals we have reported in this study, we began by asking whether differences in local Ca<sup>2+</sup> buffering could account for this heterogeneity. To examine the role of Ca<sup>2+</sup> buffering in the variability of local Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals across different cells and different ribbons (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figs. 8A</xref> and <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">8D</xref>, respectively), we compared proximal (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figs. 8B</xref> and <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">8E</xref>) and distal (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figs. 8C</xref> and <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">8F</xref>) Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals in 10 mM EGTA by averaging the Ca<sup>2+</sup> recordings from all the ribbons of a given cell (Supplementary Figs. 6 and 7). When the Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals were restricted to the ribbon sites with 10 mM EGTA in the pipette solution (Supplementary Tables 1 and 2), the amplitude of the ribbon-proximal and ribbon-distal Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals averaged over all ribbons of a given cell exhibited significant variation across different cells (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figs. 8B</xref>, <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">8C</xref>, and Supplementary Fig. 6). We next compared variability in Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals in the presence of 10 mM EGTA at individual ribbons within the same cell (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8D</xref> and Supplementary Fig. 7) at proximal (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8E</xref>) and distal (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8F</xref>) locations. For the cell described in <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figs. 8D-8F</xref>, the proximal Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals were significantly different across all ribbons examined, and there were considerable differences in distal Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals between ribbons, with the exception of ribbons numbered 2 and 5. These findings suggest that the heterogeneity in proximal and distal CaÂ²âº signals at distinct ribbons within the same cell may result from different underlying mechanisms, for example, heterogeneity in Cav expression or subtype and Ca<sup>2+</sup> handling mechanisms. These findings suggest that exogenous Ca<sup>2+</sup> buffering has a negligible effect on experimentally observed heterogeneity and variability of the proximal Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals and that local Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals at RBC ribbons are dominated by Ca<sup>2+</sup> in regions close to the ribbon base where Cav channels are located.</p>

<p>We examined the distribution of these 30â41 synaptic ribbons within the zebrafish RBC terminals. The distribution of RBC ribbons as estimated by the distance between ribbon sites (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9B</xref> and Video 1; see <italic>Materials and Methods</italic>) revealed a wide distribution in synaptic ribbon distance to its nearest neighbor across the three reconstructed RBCs (means of 2.48 Â± 0.12 Âµm, 1.84 Â± 0.06 Âµm and 1.98 Â± 0.08 Âµm; <xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9C</xref>). The distance between RBC synaptic ribbons ranged from 141 nm to 6 Âµm, with a mean of 2 Â± 0.05 Âµm (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9D</xref>; across all three reconstructed RBCs). Of the 510 zebrafish RBC synaptic ribbons, only 4 (0.8%) were separated by distances smaller than our confocal microscope resolution limit of 270 nm.</p>
<p>To reveal whether heterogeneity in synaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals correlates with active zone size, we compared the shape and size of the ribbon active zones across the three reconstructed RBCs. Our results show significant variations in the shape and size of zebrafish RBC synaptic ribbons in RBCs and associated active zones (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Fig. 10</xref>). On average, individual ribbons spanned 2â5 consecutive sections, with some located within the axons or closer to the terminal. The SBF-SEM images and 3D projections of ribbon structures (colored in magenta) revealed considerable variability in shape and size across all dimensions, as illustrated in <xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Figs. 10AâC</xref>. The number of Cav channels per active zone in hair cells from chicken, frog, and turtle varies with the size of the synaptic ribbon <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">76</xref></sup>. We thus measured the area of the ribbon facing the plasma membrane where the Cav channels are known to be located to estimate the number of Cav channels per active zone and to determine whether variation in active zone size might plausibly contribute to the heterogeneity in Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling.

<title>The size of the active zone and maximal Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx correlate with the size of the synaptic ribbon</title>
<p>To reveal whether larger ribbons display stronger maximal Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx, we measured Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals in response to a series of 200-ms depolarizations. We first imaged TAMRA-RBP and Cal520LA-RBP in sequential scans to obtain ribbon location and resting Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels. To maximize the capture of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals during brief stimuli, we image the Cal520LA-RBP channel, followed by TAMRA-RBP and Cal520LA-RBP sequential scans to confirm the ribbon locations. We found that the maximum amplitude of depolarization-evoked Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals increased with an increase in ribeye fluorescence (<xref rid="fig11" ref-type="fig">Fig. 11A &amp; B</xref> and Video 3; r = 0.51, N = 121 ribbons, p&lt; 0.001), consistent with findings reported in cochlear inner hair cells <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref></sup>.

<title>A deep look at the active zone Ca<sup>2+</sup> microdomain in RBC terminals</title>
<p>In this study, we developed a quantitative nanophysiology approach using ribeye-bound CaÂ²âº indicators and fluorescently labeled RBP, combined with ratiometric dual-color imaging, to measure changes in CaÂ²âº concentration at and along the ribbon axis. By targeting CaÂ²âº indicators to the ribbon combined with fluorescently labeled RBP, we determined the Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration along the ribbon at different distances from active zone, and found that near the ribbon base the Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration could increase to an average of 26 Î¼M upon depolarization. Given the localization of our indicator on the ribbon and minimal sensitivity to exogenous buffers, we believe that our ribbon-proximal signal represents Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations on the ribbon in locations very near release sites, likely some of those that contribute to vesicle resupply. Notably, the [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] <sub>i</sub> levels obtained from our nanophysiology approach using confocal microscopy are similar to those that were reported for measurements in hair cells using Stimulated Emission Depletion (STED) lifetime measurements <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>. Previous work on RBCs found slowing of recovery from paired-pulse depression by EGTA, suggesting that Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels at distal sites on the ribbon might be important for the recruitment of new vesicles following depletion of the RRP and UFRP <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>. Here, we measured directly the effect of EGTA on the spread of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals and found that the Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal at the distal half of the ribbon was two-fold lower than that at the location proximal to the membrane under conditions of low Ca<sup>2+</sup> buffering. It should be noted, however, that diffraction of light during the optical imaging procedure is likely to underestimate spatiotemporal [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] along the ribbon. Therefore, we used our measurement of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> current per ribbon to develop a detailed computational model that allowed us to resolve the expected profile of Ca<sup>2+</sup> microdomains governing UFRP fusion. The model results shown in <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref> reveal, on a finer spatial scale, the distribution of Ca<sup>2+</sup> around a ribbon in the presence of various quantities of immobile endogenous buffer and added exogenous buffers. Our finding of high proximal [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] levels on the order of 26 ÂµM recorded using a ribeye-bound low-affinity indicator dye is in qualitative agreement with the simulated high concentration of Ca<sup>2+</sup> in the microdomain at the base of the ribbon. Simulations also show that, as expected, the peak Ca<sup>2+</sup> microdomain amplitude is relatively insensitive to the concentration of endogenous immobile buffer and added EGTA, but its decay with distance is accelerated by increasing the concentrations of exogenous and endogenous buffers. In contrast, the addition of 2 mM BAPTA causes a profound reduction of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> microdomain amplitude and localizes the signal to a small volume around the ribbon. We also compared the impact of mobile vs immobile endogenous buffers on the Ca<sup>2+</sup> distribution, showing the much greater effect of mobile buffers on the microdomain amplitude and distance dependence. Although these results are generally expected<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">74</xref></sup>, the simulation results estimate the [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] levels in the vicinity of the ribbon with greater spatial and temporal resolution. As expected, the ratios of Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration values at the base of the ribbon vs. further away from the ribbon are much greater in the model simulation than our experimentally determined proximal-to-distal Ca<sup>2+</sup> ratio values due to the large size of the microscope PSF, which precludes precise localization of the corresponding Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals. Further, simulations show the effect of exogenous buffers with greater spatial resolution. However, the simulations fully agree with the overall increase of the proximal-to-distal Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration ratios by the application of exogenous Ca<sup>2+</sup> buffers, especially BAPTA. Despite the technical challenges posed by the limited spatiotemporal resolution of optical imaging, the spatial resolution attained with the nanophysiology approach developed in our study is sufficient to differentiate CaÂ²âº signals associated with distal sites on the ribbon from those localized near the plasma membrane. Conceivably, the nanophysiology approaches established here could generally be applied to other classes of ribbon-containing cells, such as rods, cones and hair cells.</p>

<title>Heterogeneity of Ca<sup>2+</sup> microdomains across RBCs terminals</title>
<p>Our quantitative nanophysiology provides evidence for the heterogeneity in synaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals across zebrafish RBCs, suggesting variability in the Ca<sup>2+</sup> microdomains as has been previously reported for hair cells <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref></sup> and cone photoreceptors. Retinal bipolar neurons contain many ribbon active zones. This ranges from 45-60 in adult goldfish, as quantified by EM <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">75</xref></sup>, or 25-45 in RBCs of adult living zebrafish, as estimated from laser scanning confocal microscopy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">78</xref></sup>. Our analyses of ribbon number across zebrafish RBCs through SBF-SEM arrived at an estimate of 31-40. The differences in the number of ribbons as determined through confocal microscopy compared to SBF-SEM could be explained by the resolution limit encountered by the confocal image analyses. Our analyses of zebrafish RBC terminal SBF-SEM images and 3D projections provide the first evidence of diversity in synaptic ribbon shape and sizes across zebrafish RBC terminals. Further, our quantitative measurements of SBF-SEM images reveal that synaptic ribbon width and length correlate with the active zone size, consistent with previous findings in hair cell ribbon synapses <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">76</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">77</xref></sup> and cone photoreceptor ribbon synapses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref></sup>. Our observation that maximal active zone CaÂ²âº influx correlates with ribeye fluorescence in live imaging is consistent with findings previously reported in hair cells <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref></sup>. Thus, we expect larger active zones, with more Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx, to have more Cav channel expression, as demonstrated for hair cell ribbon synapses <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref></sup>. Heterogeneity among ribbon active zones has been previously reported in hair cells where synaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup> microdomains varied substantially in amplitude and voltage-dependence within individual inner hair cells <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref></sup>. Studies in aquatic tiger salamander cone photoreceptors revealed that the amplitude and midpoint activation voltage of CaÂ²âº signals varied across individual ribbons within the same cone. Additionally, local CaÂ²âº signal dynamics at cone photoreceptor ribbons were found to be independently regulated <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>The faster, smaller, and more spatially confined CaÂ²âº signals that are insensitive to the application of high concentrations of exogenous CaÂ²âº buffers, referred to here as ribbon proximal CaÂ²âº signals, could be due to CaÂ²âº influx through Cav channel clusters beneath the synaptic ribbon <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>. However, the variability in CaÂ²âº signals at the distal ribbon, away from the plasma membrane, may result from the spread between two closely spaced microdomains; thus, if proximal CaÂ²âº signals are variable, the distal CaÂ²âº signals are also variable between ribbons. Alternatively, the variability in distal CaÂ²âº signals could be due to additional mechanisms, for example, CaÂ²âº influx from internal stores. Future studies should aim to elucidate the specific mechanisms underlying the observed heterogeneity in distal CaÂ²âº signals. For instance, exploring differences in CaÂ²âº release from intracellular stores or variations in CaÂ²âº sequestration, as reported in goldfish, could reveal key contributing factors <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">79</xref></sup>. Although the potential impact of these intracellular CaÂ²âº stores on CaÂ²âº microdomain heterogeneity in hair cells has not been reported,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref></sup> previous studies in goldfish bipolar cell terminals have documented spatially restricted CaÂ²âº oscillations in voltage-clamped retinal bipolar cells, occurring independently of membrane potential <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. To our knowledge, the sources of CaÂ²âº for these oscillations remain unknown. However, previous studies in goldfish bipolar cells suggest that the endoplasmic reticulum<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">79</xref></sup> and mitochondria<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup> may act as internal Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores. Notably, IPâ receptors have been localized to retinal bipolar cell terminals in some species.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">80</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">81</xref></sup></p>
<p>In the current study, we investigated possible mechanisms for heterogeneity in proximal CaÂ²âº signals by measuring the ribbon size, particularly the area of the ribbon adjacent to the plasma membrane, where Cav channel clusters are located. Our SBF-SEM shows substantial variability in synaptic ribbon size, shape, and the area of the ribbon facing the plasma membrane where Cav channel clusters are tethered. Since both CaÂ²âº signals and the area of the synaptic ribbon facing the plasma membrane are heterogeneous, we propose that the larger ribbons may anchor more channels, leading to larger CaÂ²âº microdomains. Since local Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals control kinetically distinct neurotransmitter release components, heterogeneity in local Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals may alter the rate of vesicle release and allow them to function independently. Indeed, heterogeneity in neurotransmitter release kinetics has been proposed for the observed diversity in excitatory postsynaptic current amplitudes and kinetics reported from paired recordings of goldfish bipolar cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">82</xref></sup> and ON-type mixed RBCs <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">83</xref></sup>. The heterogeneity in the RBC CaÂ²âº microdomains, synaptic ribbon shape, size, and active zone area reported in this study may contribute to regulating the dynamic range of RBC ribbon synapses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">84</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">85</xref></sup> - a hypothesis that needs to be tested in future studies.</p>

<title>Acquisition of confocal images</title>

Fluorescently labeled ribeye binding peptide (RBP) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup> and Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator were delivered to RBC via a whole-cell patch pipette placed directly at the cell terminal. We waited for 30 s after break-in to allow Cal520HA to reach equilibrium with the patch-pipette before obtaining the first fluorescence image. Rapid x-t line scans at the ribbon location were performed to localize synaptic ribbons (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.1Aii</xref>) and to monitor local changes in Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration at a single ribbon, as we demonstrated previously, to estimate the Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels at the plasma membrane and to track a single synaptic vesicle at ribbon locations <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. The z-projection from a series of confocal optical sections through the synaptic terminal (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1Ai</xref>) illustrates ribbon labeling (magenta spots). RBP fluorescence was used to localize a synaptic ribbon and to define a region for placing a scan line perpendicular to the plasma membrane, extending from the extracellular space to the cytoplasmic region beyond the ribbon to monitor changes in the Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration along the ribbon axis (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1Aii</xref>). The focal plane of the TAMRA-RBP signal was carefully adjusted for sharp focus to avoid potential errors arising from the high curvature near the top of the terminal and the plane of membrane adherence to the glass coverslip at the bottom of the terminal. Sequential dual laser scanning was performed at rates of 1.51 milliseconds per line. Two-color laser scanning methods allowed observation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.1C</xref><bold>, cyan</bold>) throughout the full extent of the ribbon in voltage-clamped synaptic terminals, while the ribbon and cell border were imaged with a second fluorescent label. The Exchange of TTL (transistor-transistor logic) pulses between the patch-clamp and imaging computers synchronized the acquisition of electrophysiological and imaging data. The precise timing of imaging relative to voltage-clamp stimuli was established using PatchMaster software to digitize horizontal-scan synced pulses from the imaging computer in parallel with the electrophysiological data (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.1B</xref>). Acquisition parameters, such as pinhole diameter, laser power, PMT gain, scan speed, optical zoom, offset, and step size were kept constant between experiments. Sequential line scans were acquired at 1-2 millisecond/line and 10 Î¼s/pixel with a scan size of 256 Ã 256 pixels. Bleed-through between the channels was confirmed with both lasers using the imaging parameters we typically use for experiments. To test bleed-through from the RBP channel (TAMRA-RBP) to the Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator (Cal-520HA and Cal-520LA), whole-cell recordings from RBC terminals were performed with patch pipette solution that contained TAMRA-RBP or the aforementioned Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicators, and line-scan images were collected and analyzed using the same procedures used for experimental samples.</p>

<p><italic>X-axis profile.</italic> To determine the Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals along the ribbon axis, we spatially averaged the x-axis profile intensity of RBP (i.e., a horizontal row of pixels, see <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.1C</xref>, <italic>top</italic>) to determine the position of the center of the ribbon and estimate the location of the plasma membrane.

The x-axis profile is also used to obtain the spatial profile of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals before, during, and after with respect to the ribbon profile. To identify the Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals specific to the ribbon location, we fit x-axis intensity profiles with the equation f(x) = s(x) + g(x), where s(x) is a sigmoid function that describes the transition from intracellular to extracellular background fluorescence at the edge of the cell, given by s(x) = b â c / (1âexp((x<sub>1/2</sub> â x)/d)), and g(x) is a Gaussian function that represents the fluorescence of RBP, given by g(x) = a exp(-(x-x0)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>/w<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>), as described <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>. The parameters x<sub>1/2</sub> and x<sub>0</sub> were taken as the x-axis positions of the plasma membrane and the fluorescence emitter, respectively. While parameter b is intracellular background fluorescence, c is extracellular background fluorescence, d is the slope of the sigmoid, a is the peak amplitude of emitter fluorescence, and w is â2* the standard deviation of the Gaussian function, in practice, the latter parameters were highly constrained by the data or by the measured PSF, leaving only x<sub>1/2</sub> and x<sub>0</sub> as free parameters in the fitting. <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.1D</xref>, demonstrates that the peak of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals (x<sub>0</sub>, cyan; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.1D</xref>) during the stimuli is proximal to the ribbon center (x<sub>0</sub>, magenta; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.1D</xref>) towards the plasma membrane (x<sub>1/2</sub>, magenta; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.1D</xref>), as expected for Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx originating from Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels localized in the plasma membrane <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup>.</p>
<p><italic>T-axis profile.</italic> The temporal profiles of the Cal520, Cal520-RBP, and TAMRA-RBP signals were determined by analyzing the time-axis profile of the x-t line scan to obtain the kinetics of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient with respect to the ribbon. We determined the baseline kinetics by averaging the fluorescence obtained immediately before depolarization. The timing of depolarization and the amplitude of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> current was obtained from the PatchMaster software. The rising phase of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient was fit with the sigmoid function, the peak of which is referred to as the peak amplitude Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient.</p>
<p>We used this baseline profile of ribbon-proximal Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals to distinguish signals proximal or distal to the ribbon despite the distance between these two signals being within the PSF. For example, the ribbon-proximal signals were obtained by averaging 5 pixels of the temporal profile of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals (obtained with Cal520 or Cal520-RBP) between the x<sub>1/2</sub> and x<sub>0</sub> values obtained in the x-axis profile of TAMRA-RBP.

The constant C = tanh(Î±*<italic>Î²</italic>) ensures that <italic>f</italic>(0) = 0 at the start of the stimulation, <italic>t</italic> = 0. This fitting function reaches its peak value <italic>F</italic><sub>peak</sub> at <italic>t = t</italic><sub>peak</sub>, as determined from the averaged fluorescence trace.

Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions enter through 4 channels (or clusters of channels) at the base of the ribbon indicated by black disks in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>, forming a square with a side length of 80 nm; this highly simplified channel arrangement is sufficient to capture the level of detail in spatial [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] distribution that we seek to resolve. Each of the four clusters admits a quarter of the total Ca<sup>2+</sup> current. Ca<sup>2+</sup> current values and current pulse durations are listed in <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>. Although the actual distribution of Cav channels is more heterogeneous, channels close to the ribbon play a greater role in neurotransmitter release <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>The simulation includes a single dominant Ca<sup>2+</sup> buffer with molecules possessing a single Ca<sup>2+</sup> ion binding site. We assume that only immobile buffer is present in a patch-clamped cell, since any mobile buffer would diffuse into recording pipette. Simulations with mobile buffer in an un-patched cell are also provided (Supplementary Fig. 4B&amp;C). Buffer parameter values were set to values reported by <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>, namely dissociation constant of 2 ÂµM, and total concentration of 1.44 mM (total buffering capacity at rest of 720). We also examine the impact of the assumption on buffer concentration by repeating the simulation with a lower buffering capacity of 100 (total buffer concentration of 200 ÂµM). The Ca<sup>2+</sup> ion diffusivity is set to 0.22 Âµm<sup>2</sup>/ms <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">89</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>To minimize the number of undetermined parameters, we assumed the same parameters for the Ca<sup>2+</sup> clearance on all surfaces, with one high-capacity but lower affinity process simulating Na<sup>+</sup>/Ca<sup>2+</sup> exchangers, and one lower capacity but higher affinity process simulating Ca<sup>2+</sup> extrusion by ATPase PMCA and SERCA pumps. We used the Hill coefficient of <italic>m</italic>=2 for the Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitivity of the SERCA pumps on all surfaces except the bottom surface <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">90</xref></sup>, whereas Hill coefficient of <italic>m</italic>=1 corresponds to PMCA pumps on the bottom surface <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">91</xref></sup>. Thus, the flux of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] across the surface (ions extruded per unit area per unit time) is described by
<disp-formula>
<graphic xlink:href="617078v2_ueqn2.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula>
where <italic>C</italic> is the Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration, <italic>D<sub>C</sub></italic> is the Ca<sup>2+</sup> diffusivity, and <bold><italic>n</italic> â â½<italic>C</italic></bold> is the gradient of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] normal to the boundary. The constant leak term Î¦<sub>Leak</sub> ensures that the flux is zero at the resting value [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>rest</sub> = <italic>C</italic><sub>0</sub> = 0.1 ÂµM. The Ca<sup>2+</sup> clearance rate and affinity parameters for the pumps and exchangers are listed in Supplementary Table 3. We note however that the density of Na<sup>+</sup>-Ca<sup>2+</sup> exchangers and PMCA/SERCA pumps are rough estimates and have a significant effect on results only for longer stimulation durations of over 100-200 ms. Reaction-diffusion equations for [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] and buffer are solved numerically using Calcium Calculator software version 6.10.7 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c92">92</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93">93</xref></sup>.</p>

<title>Serial block-face scanning electron microscopy (SBF-SEM)</title>
<p>The eyecups of adult (16 â¼20-month-old) zebrafish were dissected in bicarbonate-buffered Amesâ medium and, after removing the lens, the eyecups were fixed in 4% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M sodium-cacodylate buffer at RT for one hour, followed by overnight fixation at 4Â°C. Thereafter, samples were treated to generate blocks for serial block face scanning electron microscopy (SBF-SEM) according to the published protocol <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c94">94</xref></sup>, in this case using Zeiss 3-View SBF-SEM. Multiple 35 Âµm montages were acquired at a 5 nm X-Y resolution and a 50nm Z resolution across the entire retina from the outer (photoreceptor) layer to the inner (ganglion) cell layer. Images were inspected visually and structures of interest were traced using the TrakEM plug-in in ImageJ software (NIH/Fiji), as described below.</p>
<p><italic>Analysis of serial block-face scanning electron microscopy images.</italic> SBF-SEM image stacks of the zebrafish retina were imported, aligned, visualized, and analyzed using the TrakEM plugin (version 1.5h) in ImageJ software (NIH). RBC1 were identified based on their characteristic morphology and 4-7 Î¼m terminal size, as previously described <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup>. RBCs, synaptic ribbons, pre-synaptic membranes, and the area of the ribbon touching the plasma membrane were traced, painted using the TrakEM brush features, and rendered in 3D for structural visualization. The area of the synaptic ribbon touching the RBC membrane was quantified using the measuring tools in ImageJ and images were prepared using Adobe Photoshop software (version 25.9). The distance between each ribbon from three different RBCs and its nearest five ribbons (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9B</xref> and Video 1) was measured as follows: Ribbons on the same plane had their linear distance measured, whereas the distance between ribbons that were close to each other but in different layers was calculated using the Pythagorean Theorem.</p>

<p>This paper describes technically-impressive measurements of calcium signals near synaptic ribbons in goldfish bipolar cells. The data presented provides high spatial and temporal resolution information about calcium concentrations along the ribbon at various distances from the site of entry at the plasma membrane. This is important information. Important gaps in the data presented mean that the evidence for the main conclusions is currently inadequate.</p>
<p>Strengths</p>
<p>(1) The technical aspects of the measurements are impressive. The authors use calcium indicators bound to the ribbon and high-speed line scans to resolve changes with a spatial resolution of ~250 nm and a temporal resolution of less than 10 ms. These spatial and temporal scales are much closer to those relevant for vesicle release than previous measurements.</p>
<p>(2) The use of calcium indicators with very different affinities and different intracellular calcium buffers helps provide confirmation of key results.</p>
<p>Weaknesses</p>
<p>(1) Multiple key points of the paper lack statistical tests or summary data from populations of cells. For example, the text states that the proximal and distal calcium kinetics in Figure 2A differ. This is not clear from the inset to Figure 2A - where the traces look like scaled versions of each other. Values for time to half-maximal peak fluorescence are given for one example cell but no statistics or summary are provided. Figure 8 shows examples from one cell with no summary data. This issue comes up in other places as well.</p>
<p>(2) Figure 5 is confusing. The figure caption describes red, green, and blue traces, but the figure itself has only two traces in each panel and none are red, green, or blue. It's not possible currently to evaluate this figure.</p>
<p>(3) The rise time measurements in Figure 2 are very different for low and high-affinity indicators, but no explanation is given for this difference. Similarly, the measurements of peak calcium concentration in Figure 4 are very different from the two indicators. That might suggest that the high-affinity indicator is strongly saturated, which raises concerns about whether that is impacting the kinetic measurements.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The study introduces new tools for measuring intracellular Ca2+ concentration gradients around retinal rod bipolar cell (rbc) synaptic ribbons. This is done by comparing the Ca2+ profiles measured with mobile Ca2+ indicator dyes versus ribbon-tethered (immobile) Ca2+ indicator dyes. The Ca2+ imaging results provide a straightforward demonstration of Ca2+ gradients around the ribbon and validate their experimental strategy. This experimental work is complemented by a coherent, open-source, computational model that successfully describes changes in Ca2+ domains as a function of Ca2+ buffering. In addition, the authors try to demonstrate that there is heterogeneity among synaptic ribbons within an individual rbc terminal.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The study introduces a new set of tools for estimating Ca2+ concentration gradients at ribbon AZs, and the experimental results are accompanied by an open-source, computational model that nicely describes Ca2+ buffering at the rbc synaptic ribbon. In addition, the dissociated retinal preparation remains a valuable approach for studying ribbon synapses. Lastly, excellent EM.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Heterogeneity in the spatiotemporal dynamics of Ca2+ influx was not convincingly related to ribbon size, nor was the functional relevance of Ca2+ dynamics to rod bipolars demonstrated (e.g., exocytosis to different postsynaptic targets). In addition, the study would benefit from the inclusion of the Ca2+ currents that were recorded in parallel with the Ca2+ imaging.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this study, the authors have developed a new Ca indicator conjugated to the peptide, which likely recognizes synaptic ribbons, and have measured microdomain Ca near synaptic ribbons at retinal bipolar cells. This interesting approach allows one to measure Ca close to transmitter release sites, which may be relevant for synaptic vesicle fusion and replenishment. Though microdomain Ca at the active zone of ribbon synapses has been measured by Hudspeth and Moser, the new study uses the peptide recognizing synaptic ribbons, potentially measuring the Ca concentration relatively proximal to the release sites.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The study is in principle technically well done, and the peptide approach is technically interesting, which allows one to image Ca near the particular protein complexes. The approach is potentially applicable to other types of imaging.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Peptides may not be entirely specific, and the genetic approach tagging particular active zone proteins with fluorescent Ca indicator proteins may well be more specific. I also feel that &quot;Nano-physiology&quot; is overselling, because the measured Ca is most likely the local average surrounding synaptic ribbons. With this approach, nobody knows about the real release site Ca or the Ca relevant for synaptic vesicle replenishment. It is rather &quot;microdomain physiology&quot; which measures the local Ca near synaptic ribbons, relatively large structures responsible for fusion, replenishment, and recycling of synaptic vesicles.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>As we had mentioned in the text, we do believe that the high-affinity version is partially saturated. This will be a problem for strong depolarizations and signals near the membrane. The higher affinity indicators are more useful for reporting calcium levels on the ribbon after the depolarization when the signal from the low affinity indicators is small. We will address this in the discussion of the revision.</p>

<p>Thank you for this critique. We agree that the relationship between size and Ca2+ signal is not established by our recordings. By analogy to the hair cell literature, we believe that it is a reasonable hypothesis, but more studies will be necessary to definitively determine whether the signal relates to the ribbon size or synaptic signaling. This will be addressed in future experiments.</p>
<p>We will include the Ca<sup>2+</sup> currents in the revision.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this study, the authors have developed a new Ca indicator conjugated to the peptide, which likely recognizes synaptic ribbons, and have measured microdomain Ca near synaptic ribbons at retinal bipolar cells. This interesting approach allows one to measure Ca close to transmitter release sites, which may be relevant for synaptic vesicle fusion and replenishment. Though microdomain Ca at the active zone of ribbon synapses has been measured by Hudspeth and Moser, the new study uses the peptide recognizing synaptic ribbons, potentially measuring the Ca concentration relatively proximal to the release sites.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The study is in principle technically well done, and the peptide approach is technically interesting, which allows one to image Ca near the particular protein complexes. The approach is potentially applicable to other types of imaging.</p>

<p>Thank you very much for this appreciation.</p>

<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Peptides may not be entirely specific, and the genetic approach tagging particular active zone proteins with fluorescent Ca indicator proteins may well be more specific. I also feel that &quot;Nano-physiology&quot; is overselling, because the measured Ca is most likely the local average surrounding synaptic ribbons. With this approach, nobody knows about the real release site Ca or the Ca relevant for synaptic vesicle replenishment. It is rather &quot;microdomain physiology&quot; which measures the local Ca near synaptic ribbons, relatively large structures responsible for fusion, replenishment, and recycling of synaptic vesicles.</p>

<p>The peptide approach has been used fairly extensively in the ribbon synapse field and the evidence that it efficiently labels the ribbon is well established, however, we do acknowledge that the peptide is in equilibrium with a cytoplasmic pool. Thus, some of the signal arises from this cytoplasmic pool. The alternative of a genetically encoded Ca-indicator concatenated to a ribbon protein would not have this problem, but would be more limited in flexibility in changing calcium indicators. We believe both approaches have their merits, each with separate advantages and disadvantages.</p>
<p>As for the nano vs. micro argument, we certainly do not want to suggest that we are measuring the same nano-domains, in the 10s of nanometers, that drive neurotransmitter release, but we do believe we are in the sub-micrometer--100s of nmârange. We chose the term based on the usage by other authors to describe similar measurements (Neef et al., 2018; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-017-02612-y">https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-017-02612-y</ext-link>), but we see the reviewerâs point. To avoid confusion, we will change the title in the revision.</p>
