<title>Abstract</title>
<p>DNA origami technology is a method for designing and constructing nanoscale structures using DNA, and it is being applied across various fields. This technology was advanced by developing the nanospring (NS), a fluorescently visible molecular spring that quantifies forces through its extension and has been used to measure myosin-generated forces. This study aims to measure the force exerted by the kinesin-3 motor protein KIF1A, mutations of which cause KIF1A-associated neurological disorder (KAND) and are associated with reduced force and motility. Unlike kinesin-1, KIF1A detaches easily under perpendicular loads, which can occur in optical tweezers experiments. By applying force parallel to the microtubule using the NS, we were able to precisely measure the stall force even for KAND mutants, for which such measurements are typically challenging. This result highlights the potential of the NS as a new tool for force spectroscopy in biophysics.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The kinesin superfamily of microtubule-based motor proteins in humans consists of approximately 45 types and represents a large group of motor proteins with diverse functions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. Among them, KIF1A, a member of the kinesin-3 subfamily, plays a critical role in the long-distance transport of synaptic vesicle precursors and other cargos in neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. This transport is essential for maintaining synaptic activity, supporting neuronal development, and ensuring proper neuronal function. Structurally, KIF1A contains a motor domain that binds to microtubules and hydrolyzes ATP to generate mechanical force, driving movement toward the plus end of microtubules. In recent years, KIF1A has gained significant attention due to the identification of over 100 mutations linked to KIF1A-associated neurological disorder (KAND), a spectrum of neurodevelopmental conditions characterized by spastic paraplegia, intellectual disability, and progressive neurodegeneration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Single-molecule measurements of KIF1A mutants associated with KAND have developed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>. Precise measurements of the velocity of KIF1A single molecules have been achieved using TIRF microscopy, while optical tweezers have enabled force measurements. These techniques have been used to compare the biophysical properties of KIF1A single molecules with those of its mutants that cause KAND. The motility of the single molecules has been reported to correlate with disease severity, highlighting the importance of single-molecule biophysical measurements into precision medicine<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>. However, there is still room for improvement in the force measurements of KIF1A using optical tweezers. Stall force, defined as the maximum force that a motor can generate when its movement is halted, is measured by applying a load opposite to the microtubule plus end direction using optical tweezers. To date, optical tweezers have been used to measure the stall force of various microtubule-based motor proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. Since a submicron-sized bead is attached to the kinesin (â¼10 nm) and force is applied via the bead to the kinesin in this method, the applied force tends to pull it upward, which can sometimes lead to its detachment from the microtubule<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. Since KIF1A is easier to detach from microtubules compared to conventional kinesin-1, it is more challenging to successfully stall KIF1A in optical tweezer experiments without detachment. Indeed, most of the stalls lasted less than one second, and the force trajectories exhibited sawtooth-like patterns in previous studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>To overcome the challenges associated with force measurements in KAND mutants, we employed an alternative approach based on DNA nanotechnology. In a previous study, Iwaki et al. developed a distinct method for force measurement by using programmable DNA origami to construct nanoscale, coil-like springs known as nanosprings (NSs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. These NSs are fluorescently labeled, allowing their extension to be visualized with conventional fluorescence microscopy. Since the forceâextension relationship of the NS is pre-calibrated using acoustic force spectroscopy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>, the force exerted on the spring can be quantitatively estimated from its measured extension. In this study, we applied the NS method to measure the force generated by single KIF1A molecules, including both wild-type and KAND mutants. Using the NS system, we were able to apply a horizontal load parallel to the microtubule axis to single KIF1A molecules, and clearly observed sustained stalling for several tens of seconds with reduced detachment. Notably, stalling events were also stably observed in KAND mutants such as P305L and V8M, which disrupt critical force-generating regions of the protein (e.g., the K-loop and neck linker) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. We also included the A255V mutant, previously unmeasured in force assays, which is known to affect ATP hydrolysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>. Furthermore, the NS allowed for precise stall force measurement, revealing force differences between KAND mutant homodimers and heterodimers composed of a wild-type and the mutant subunit. These results highlight the advantage of our approach in minimizing the force component perpendicular to the microtubuleâs long axis.</p>
<p>In previous single-molecule experiments in kinesin, DNA origami was used to control the number of cooperatively moving kinesin motors, and their velocities have been analyzed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>. As a distinct application of DNA-origami-based motor protein systems, in this study, we successfully measured force using only fluorescence imaging. This study is significant in that it extends fluorescence imaging from merely capturing velocity to also allowing the quantification of force. In the field of motor proteins research, measurements of physical quantities related to distance, such as velocity and stepping motion, have rapidly advanced with the development of cutting-edge microscopy techniques like a super-resolution microscopy technology MINFLUX<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>, enabling their investigation not only in glass chambers but also inside living cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>. However, since both force and velocity are crucial physical parameters to understand the functions of motor proteins, and force-velocity relationships are indeed related to their ATP hydrolysis mechanisms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>, we believe that the development of a new type of force measurement is of great significance in this field. The development of NS-based force measurement, which enables force quantification at the nanoscale, is expected to have significant implications not only in the field of motor protein research but also in the broader study of protein biophysics.</p>

<title>The NS-KIF1A-inert KIF5B complex as a force measurement system</title>
<p>To measure the force generated by single KIF1A molecule, we constructed a complex comprising a KIF1A molecule, an inert KIF5B mutant, and a NS. For KIF1A, the motor domain (amino acid residues 1â393) was used, excluding the C-terminal and cargo-binding domains (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>). Since KIF1A does not form stable dimers in the absence of cargo binding domains, a leucine zipper domain was incorporated to stabilize KIF1A dimers, mimicked the activated state of full-length KIF1A, as in the previous study <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>. As for the inert KIF5B attached to the one end of the NS, it was engineered to remain immobilized on microtubules by introducing the G234A mutation (Methods). This mutant lacks ATP hydrolysis activity and, as a result, does not exhibit motility, allowing it to remain stably attached to microtubules <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>. Both kinesins were equipped with SNAP-tags at their N-termini, which enabled chemical coupling to the NS (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>; Methods). The inert KIF5B mutant served to anchor the KIF1AâNS complex to a microtubule. This anchoring of the KIF5B to the microtubule allowed a KIF1A to stay near the microtubule, increasing the probability of its binding to the microtubule.</p>

<p>At equilibrium, in the absence of tension applied by KIF1A, the NS, uniformly labeled with 124 Cy3 fluorophores, exhibited a resting length of approximately 300 nm and appeared as a diffraction-limited circular spot in a fluorescence image (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>). In the presence of ATP, the NS extended as the KIF1A moved against the load, and its fluorescence image became an elongated shape (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>). To calibrate the pulling force acting on the NS from its extension, the acoustic force spectroscopy (AFS) was used as in the previous study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1d</xref> presents the relationship between NS extension and force measured by the AFS, revealing its nonlinear elastic behavior.

<title>Simulation-based evaluation of fluorescence image analysis methods</title>
<p>Before analyzing the fluorescence images of a NS, we generated artificial images that mimic experimental conditions in order to develop a method for estimating the length of a rod-shaped object from its fluorescence image. The artificial images were generated by placing 116 two-dimensional isotropic Gaussian functions aligned along a straight line (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>), to mimic a DNA calibration rod labeled with 116 fluorescent molecules, as introduced in the following section. The value of the variance in the Gaussian function was determined based on the approximate shape of the point spread function (PSF) of the Cy3 fluorophore (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref>). While the PSF is, in principle, influenced by the optical system, here it was used as a reference value for generating the artificial images. White noise was then added to the images. When the 116 Gaussian functions were superimposed, they appear as a single bright spot with an elliptical shape (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref>, top). For this artificial image, we present a comparison of the results obtained using two methods: the Gaussian fitting method and the chain fitting method. In the Gaussian fitting method, the whole fluorescence spot is approximated using a single two-dimensional Gaussian function <italic>I</italic><sub>g</sub>(<italic>x</italic>, <italic>y</italic>), and the estimated the standard deviation along the long axis (<italic>Ï</italic><sub>long</sub>) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref>, middle).

</fig>
<p>While the Gaussian fitting method provided reasonable results, we considered an alternative approach, called the chain fitting method, to directly estimate the length <italic>L</italic> of the model. In the Gaussian fitting method, proposed in the previous study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>, the true length <italic>L</italic> of the rod is not included as a parameter in the fitting function (<xref rid="eqn1" ref-type="disp-formula">equation (1)</xref>). The chain fitting method is designed based on the structure in which fluorescent molecules are arranged in a line, and because the fitting parameters directly include the length <italic>L</italic>, it is expected to provide a more accurate estimation than the Gaussian fitting method. The fluorescence intensity of this model can be described by the following equation:

where <italic>C</italic><sub>c</sub> is a constant, and Î¦ is the error function. <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2c</xref>, bottom shows the resulting image obtained by the chain fitting method. The simulation results indeed demonstrated that the estimated length by the chain fitting method corresponded with the true length <italic>L</italic> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d</xref>, color symbols).</p>

<title>Experimental validation of the chain fitting method using DNA calibration rods</title>
<p>We experimentally validated our approach of the chain fitting method using DNA calibration rods with known lengths.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup> <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2e</xref> shows the fluorescence images of biotinylated DNA calibration rods immobilized on a glass surface via biotin-BSA and streptavidin (Methods), recorded under the same conditions used for observation of the NSs. As illustrated in the schematic, a total of 116 Cy3 molecules were conjugated to the DNA calibration rod at equal intervals <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. The length was varied by adjusting the interval between fluorescent dyes. The end-to-end distances between fluorescent molecules were designed to be 398 nm, 501 nm, 599 nm, and 658 nm, respectively. Since the NSs were labeled with 124 Cy3 fluorescent molecules, we considered the fluorescence images obtained from these rods to be similar to those of the NSs.</p>
<p><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2f</xref> shows the <italic>Ï</italic><sub>long</sub> and length <italic>L</italic> estimated from experimental fluorescence images of DNA calibration rods using the Gaussian fitting method (<xref rid="eqn1" ref-type="disp-formula">equation (1)</xref>) and chain fitting method (<xref rid="eqn2" ref-type="disp-formula">equation (2)</xref>), respectively. There is a proportional relationship between <italic>Ï</italic><sub>long</sub> and the true length. On the other hand, <italic>L</italic> estimated by <xref rid="eqn2" ref-type="disp-formula">equation (2)</xref> provides a direct estimate close to the true length of the DNA calibration rod. However, the fact that <italic>L</italic> was approximately 10% shorter than the true length is considered to be likely due to slight bending of the DNA-origami structures caused by thermal fluctuations. Indeed, in the case of longer rods shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2e, a</xref> slight bending was observed. Accordingly, the length was corrected by a factor of 1.07 (Methods). In the following, the extension of the NS was primarily estimated using the chain fitting method. Note that results obtained using the conventional Gaussian fitting method are also presented in the Supplementary Information. The results from both methods were consistent.</p>

<title>Observation of stall behavior in wild-type KIF1A</title>
<p>The supplementary movie shows a representative example of the movement of a NS with KIF1A and KIF5B. At first an inert KIF5B is firmly fixed to the microtubule. Then, the diffusive behavior of a KIF1Aâattached to the NS, which is anchored to the microtubule via the inert KIF5Bâas it searches for a binding site on the microtubule, is observed. Once the KIF1A binds to the microtubule, it starts moving along the microtubule and stretches the spring. When the tension in the NS balances with the maximum force generated by the KIF1A, the extension temporarily halts during the time interval (attachment duration) (Î<italic>t</italic>). Eventually, the KIF1A detaches from the microtubule, the tension is released, and the NS returns to its retracted state. This cycle event was repeatedly observed.</p>
<p>The extension of the NS was estimated by the chain fitting method (<xref rid="eqn2" ref-type="disp-formula">equation (2)</xref>) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>, bottom). For the event during a time interval (2.8 s â¤ <italic>t</italic> â¤ 21.2 s), the histogram of the spring length was calculated (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>, left). The histogram exhibits a bimodal Gaussian distribution, with each peak corresponding to the extended and retracted states of the NS shown in the micrographs (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref> left). <italic>L</italic><sub>stall</sub> was calculated by averaging the NSâs extension during periods when the angular fluctuation of the angle between the NS and the microtubule was minimal (Methods). Note that the attachment of the KIF1A to the microtubule was clearly distinguished from the diffusive behavior of the KIF1A molecule, because the angular fluctuation was extremely suppressed upon the KIF1A binding to the microtubule (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>, top). In our experiments, we analyzed a total of 81 events from 24 KIF1A molecules (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref>). From the mean value of <italic>L</italic><sub>stall</sub> (549 Â± 58 nm), the stall force of the wild type KIF1A was estimated to be 3.8 pN (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) by using the force-extension calibration of the NS (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d</xref>). This value is similar to the stall force values of the wild type KIF1A(1-393) measured previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>, and larger than the detachment force values<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>.</p>

<p>In the results presented here, the length of the NS was estimated using the chain fitting method (<xref rid="eqn2" ref-type="disp-formula">equation (2)</xref>). For comparison, we also present the results obtained using the conventional Gaussian fitting method (<xref rid="eqn1" ref-type="disp-formula">equation (1)</xref>) in the Supplementary Information. The two methods provided consistent values, suggesting that future analyses can be performed without the need for prior calibration using DNA rods, which is required by the Gaussian fitting method. In addition, while direct velocity measurements were difficult in the NS-based experiments, we analyzed the behavior under low-load conditions by overlaying the time courses of 10 stall events (Supplementary Information). Although data could be recorded at 100 frames per second (fps) (Supplementary Information), long time courses could not be obtained at this frame rate, which was necessary to collect stall force data. Therefore, the data shown in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> were acquired at 33 fps). To calculate the forceâ velocity curve of KIF1A from displacement, it is necessary to capture motion at 100 fps or higher.</p>

<p>In previous studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>, most of the stalls lasted less than one second, and the force trajectories exhibited sawtooth-like patterns, which was a characteristic feature of force generation by KIF1A unlike kinesin-1, which exhibits clear stalling behavior<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>. However, in our experiments, we observed clear stall states lasting for several tens of seconds, similar to the stalling behavior observed with kinesin-1 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>). To quantify this observation, we measured the attachment durations (Î<italic>t</italic>) and analyzed the relationship between <italic>L</italic><sub>stall</sub> and Î<italic>t</italic> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3c</xref>).</p>
<p>In a single bead optical tweezers experiment, it was reported that Î<italic>t</italic> was correlated with the detachment force when the detachment of a KIF1A from the microtubule was likely accelerated by forces applied perpendicular to the microtubuleâs long axis, due to the contact between a single bead and a underlying microtubule (schematic in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3c</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. By using the three-bead optical tweezers system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>, which was a modified version of the conventional optical trapping assay, to minimize the forces applied perpendicular to the microtubuleâs long axis, it was found that Î<italic>t</italic> did not depended on the detachment force (schematic in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3c</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>.

<title>Effect of electrostatic repulsion on force measurement</title>
<p>Because the DNA-based NS is negatively charged, we investigated the effect of its electrostatic repulsion with negatively charged microtubules. This repulsion could potentially promote the detachment of KIF1A from the microtubule, raising a concern for the measurement. To minimize repulsive interactions between the NS and the microtubule, we coated the NS with oligolysine conjugated to polyethylene glycol (PEG) to render the spring electrically neutral (Methods). Based on a statistical test, there was little difference in <italic>L</italic><sub>stall</sub> and attachment duration (Î<italic>t</italic>) between the conditions with and without PEG (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3c</xref>, d; MannâWhitney U test, <italic>p</italic> = 0.4718).

<p>P305 of the motor domain of KIF1A is located adjacent to the positively charged K-loop insertion region of KIF1A (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref>).

Therefore, a mutation at P305 directly affects the interaction between KIF1A and microtubules.

<p>The wild-type KIF1A depicted in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref> was replaced with the P305L mutant, and force measurements were performed using a NS for the mutant (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b</xref>). Although it has been reported that the landing rate of P305L on microtubules was reduced by 97%<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>, in this experiment, an inert KIF5B firmly anchored to the microtubule at the end of the NS, which kept the P305L mutant in close proximity to the microtubule, thereby effectively increasing its binding probability. In other words, the anchoring effect enabled clear observation of microtubule binding by the P305L mutant. This high binding rate is one of the advantages of the NSâKIF1Aâinert KIF5B complex, when used as a force measurement system. Although the force generated by the P305L mutant was significantly lower than that of the wild type, and stall events were difficult to detect due to thermal fluctuations, in our experiments, they were easily detected based on the angular fluctuation, defined in Methods section, (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b</xref>, top), which is another advantage of this measurement system. Based on the value of <italic>L</italic><sub>stall</sub>, the force generated by the mutant was reduced to be 0.2 pN (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Note that the histogram of <italic>L</italic><sub>stall</sub> is shown in Supplementary Information.</p>
<p>KIF1A is considered to primarily form dimers to anterogradely transport synaptic cargos in neurons. In recent years, the motility of heterodimers composed of wild-type and KAND-associated mutant subunits has begun to be investigated experimentally<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>. In heterozygous patients, WT/WT, P305L/WT, and P305L/P305L dimers coexist, highlighting the importance of studying the heterodimers. As in the previous study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>, we constructed heterodimers composed of wild-type and P305L subunits (Methods) and performed stall force experiment using these heterodimers (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4c</xref>). In <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4d</xref>, we compared the stall length (<italic>L</italic><sub>stall</sub>) between the P305L/P305L homodimer and the P305L/WT heterodimer, and found that the stall force was increased in the heterodimer. This slight difference between the P305L/P305L homodimer and the P305L/WT heterodimer became apparent due to the improved sensitivity of our NS-based assay, which enabled detection of subtle differences in stall force.</p>

<title>Stall force measurement of the KIF1A disease-associated variants V8M and A255V</title>
<p>Like kinesin-1, KIF1A also utilizes conformational changes in the neck linker to generate force<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>. The V8M mutation may hinder the neck linker from accessing its docking pocket, which in turn disrupts docking and impairs force generation (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref>). Using the NS-based stall force measurement, we also observed that the stall force of the V8M homodimer was reduced by approximately half (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4e</xref>, <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), consistent with the previous study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>The A255 residue is located in loop L11 of the switch II cluster and may affect KIF1A function by altering the structure of L11 within switch II or the back door<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref>). In the single-molecule experiments, although its force has not yet been measured, a decrease in velocity has been reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>. Loss of function in the switch II region or the back door may impair the conversion of ATP hydrolysisâdriven conformational changes into mechanical force. Indeed, our NS-based stall force measurements revealed that the stall force was reduced by approximately half compared to the wild-type (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4h</xref>, <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).</p>
<p>We also performed stall force measurements for heterodimers composed of the KAND mutants V8M (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4f</xref>) or A255V (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4i</xref>) and the wild-type subunit. But unexpectedly, these heterodimers did not exhibit an increase in stall force upon heterodimerization with the wild-type subunit (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4g</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4j</xref>). As a similar example involving a mutation, a previous study on R254Q reported that the velocity (without load) did not increase even when forming a heterodimer with the wild-type<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>. It appears that in the wild-type/mutant heterodimer, the function of the wild-type subunit may be compromised by the poor performance of the mutant subunit, suggesting the presence of negative cooperativity. A detailed investigation of amino acid mutations in the neck linker and switch II regions will be an important issue for future research.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We measured the force generated by KIF1A using the NSs developed by Iwaki <italic>et al.</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). Because KIF1A more readily detaches from microtubules compared to kinesin-1, and the forces applied perpendicular to the microtubuleâs long axis often causes detachment in optical tweezers experiments, making it difficult to observe its stall behavior. In contrast, by using the NS, we were able to apply load to a single KIF1A molecule solely in the horizontal direction along microtubules, enabling clear observation of the stall events (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). Note that, while performing these measurements, we also improved the image analysis method (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). In a previous study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>, the length of the NS was estimated using the Gaussian fitting method (<xref rid="eqn1" ref-type="disp-formula">equation (1)</xref>). In contrast, in the present study, we adopted the chain fitting method (<xref rid="eqn2" ref-type="disp-formula">equation (2)</xref>), which allowed for a more direct estimation of the length <italic>L</italic> from the images. Below, we discuss the advantages and future prospects of NS-based force measurements.</p>
<p>In KAND mutants, evolutionary scale model (ESM) scores have been compared with clinical phenotype scores such as the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Composite (VABS-ABC) scores <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>. ESM refers to large-scale protein language models based on Transformer architectures, trained on millions of sequences to predict structure, function, and mutation effects from primary amino acid sequences<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>. However, due to the currently low correlation between ESM scores and clinical severity, incorporating biophysical parameters such as velocity and force may provide additional predictive insight, particularly for de novo mutationsâa direction already explored in part by a previous study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>. In the present study, we propose a high-throughput method for accurately measuring the force generated by KIF1A mutants using the NSs. Anchoring a KIF1AâNS complex to the microtubule via an inert KIF5B facilitated the observation of stall events even for KAND-related KIF1A mutants (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>), which were otherwise prone to detachment due to the dysfunctions caused by the mutations. Indeed, we successfully measured the stall force of several KAND-associated mutants, including P305L, V8M, and A255V. P305L, V8M, and A255V are representative mutants that primarily impair microtubule binding, force generation near the neck linker, and ATP hydrolysis near the Switch II region, respectively (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref>). Notably, stall force measurements for the homodimeric A255V and heterodimeric combinations P305L/WT, V8M/WT, and A255V/WT had not previously been reported using optical tweezers. Building a database of such biophysical measurements will be essential for linking molecular dysfunction to clinical outcomes. The NS-based force assays offer a powerful platform for this purpose.</p>
<p>As noted in the introduction, optical tweezers have been the primary method for measuring forces generated by motor proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>. An advantage of the NS is that it enables precise investigation of the force exerted by a single motor protein, whereas multiple kinesin molecules may attach to a bead in optical tweezers experiments. Moreover, unlike optical tweezers, which require individual manipulation of each bead and can measure the force of only one motor protein at a time, the NS-based assay allows simultaneous recording and force measurements of multiple NSâKIF1A complexes within the field of view. This results in significantly higher throughput and represents a key advantage over optical tweezers. From the perspective of compatibility with other measurement techniques, the near-infrared laser used in optical tweezers readily causes photobleaching of organic dyes, making single-molecule imaging of dye-labeled proteins challenging. For example, this means that optical tweezers cannot be used simultaneously with MINFLUX<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>. Moreover, the NS can also be combined with high-speed AFM or electron microscopy, enabling structural analysis of proteins under quantitatively controlled mechanical load. In fact, although not NSs, DNA origami-based thick filaments with attached myosin have been investigated using AFM<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>. Therefore, the DNA origami-based NSs are also expected to be used with AFM.</p>
<p>There are also some advantages to using the NSs. In this study, we used the NSs with different physical properties from those used in the previous force measurement on myosin VIÂ¹Â¹. Wild-type KIF1A generates a larger stall force than the myosin, requiring a different dynamic range for the nonlinear behavior of the spring. Owing to DNA origami technology, the mechanical properties of the NS can be tuned to match the appropriate force range for measuring molecular stiffness.</p>
<p>With the recent development of the super-resolution microscope MINFLUX, live-cell tracking of single fluorescent molecules has become possible, enabling the precise observation of kinesin-1 stepping motion in living cells with nanometer spatial and millisecond temporal resolution<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>. To date, models of chemo-mechanical energy conversion in motor proteins have been proposed based on the load dependence of their stepping motion <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>. The intracellular environment is highly crowded with biomolecules and also contains active fluctuations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>, resulting in complex viscoelastic properties and an inhomogeneous refractive index. This leads to challenges in using optical tweezers, such as accurately estimating the trap stiffness of laser-trapped vesicles in cells. On the other hand, the NSs offer a method of measuring force solely through fluorescence imaging, providing a potential solution to this problem. In relation to cellular applications, the NSs have already been used as force sensors to visualize the dynamics of integrins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. Expanding such applications, the introduction of the NSâkinesin complex into living cells offers a promising approach to uncover the load-dependent dynamics of kinesin in its native environment.</p>

This KIF1A (1â 393)-LZ-SNAP-6His construct was then used as template to generate the 3 aberrant motors by site-directed mutagenesis using the KOD Plus mutagenesis kit (TOYOBO, Cat#SMK-101) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref>). A recombinant human KIF1A(1â393)-LZ-SNAP-Strep-tagII construct was used to develop heterodimers of wild type and mutant KIF1A. To create this KIF1A motor domain construct, a human KIF1A(1â393)-LZ-mScarlet-I-Strep-tagII construct namely pSN643 was modified as follows: The mScarlet-I sequence of pSN643 was replaced by SNAP cDNA sequence. All constructs were confirmed by sequencing. Inactive mutant kinesin 5 B (G234A) expression vector was a gift from Dr. Yuta Shimamoto (National Institute of Genetics), which has been described (pYS05 K560 pET-17b KIF5B (1-560, G234A)::LZ::His-tag)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>.</p>

<p>Proteins were expressed in BL21(DE3) and SNAP-tagged KIF1A motor domain homodimers and inactive mutant KIF5B (G234A) homodimer were purified as previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. Briefly, His-tagged SNAP-tagged KIF1A motor domain plasmids were transformed into BL21(DE3) (Novagen #69450), and the cells were cultured on LB agar supplemented with ampicillin at 37Â°C overnight. Colonies were picked and cultured in 10 ml LB medium supplemented with ampicillin overnight. Next morning, the culture was transferred to 750 mL of 2.5ÃYT (20 g/L Tryptone, 12.5 g/L Yeast Extract, 6.5 g/L NaCl) supplemented with 10 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) and 100 Âµg/ml ampicillin in 2 L flasks and shaken at 37Â°C. Two flasks were routinely prepared. When OD600 reached 0.6, the flasks were cooled in ice-cold water for 30 min, then isopropyl-Î²-D-thiogalactoside (IPTG) was added to the cooled culture to final concentration of 0.2 mM to induce expression. The culture was shaken at 18Â°C overnight (â¼16 hours), and the bacteria expressing recombinant proteins were harvested by centrifugation as 4,000 rpm, 20 min, 4Â°C, (HITACH himac CR-21). The cell pellet was resuspended in Phosphate Buffered Saline; PBS(-) and centrifuged again (4000 rpm, 20 min, 4Â°C). Supernatant was discarded completely, then cell pellets were frozen and stored at â80Â°C until use. To purify recombinant protein, bacteria pellets were resuspended in protein buffer (50 mM HEPES, pH 8.0, 150 mM KCH<sub>3</sub>COO, 2 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 10% glycerol), supplemented with 1 mM ATP, protease inhibitors, such as 4-(2-Aminoethyl) benzenesulfonylfluoride (AEBSF, FUJIFILM), Leupeptin (FUJIFILM, Wako #336-40413), Aprotinin from Bovine Lung (FUJIFILM, Wako #013-28311), and Pepstatin A (FUJIFILM, Wako #330-43973)), using 5 mL protein buffer per gram of wet cell paste. After gentle vortex, bacteria resuspension was with Benzonase nuclease (Novagen) and Lysozyme (Merch), followed by sonication using Branson SONIFIER 250. Lysate was obtained by centrifugation (40,000 rpm, 30 min, 4Â°C, HITACH himac CP-80Î±). After centrifugation, the supernatant was loaded on TALONÂ® Metal Affinity Resin (Takara Bio Inc, Cat#635502), and incubated for 30 min. at 4Â°C with mild shaking under platform shaker. The resin was washed twice with His-tag wash buffer (50 mM HEPES, pH 8.0, 450 mM KCH<sub>3</sub>COO, 2 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 10% glycerol, 10 mM imidazole), containing 100 ÂµM ATP. Protein was eluted with 10 ml His-tag elution buffer (50 mM HEPES, pH 8.0, 150 mM KCH<sub>3</sub>COO, 2 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 10% glycerol, 500 mM imidazole) containing 100 ÂµM ATP. Eluted fractions were collected and concentrated to â¼300 Âµl using Amicon Ultra centrifugal filters (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany). The affinity-purified protein was further separated by gel filtration using a Superdex<sup>TM</sup> 200 Increase 10/300 GL column (Cytiva) in protein buffer on an NGC Chromatography system (Bio-Rad Laboratories). Peak fractions were collected and aliquoted and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen. Protein concentration was assessed by Bradford method (BioRad Protein assay dye Reagent Concentrates, Cat#5000006). Each step of purification was analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) (Supplementary Fig. S1). All recombinant DNA experiments conducted in accordance with Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety and all procedures were approved by Genetic Modification Safety Committee of Yamaguchi University (J18016). Preparation of all plasmids and recombinant proteins were performed at Yamaguchi University Center for Gene Research.</p>

The concentration of the nanostructures was determined with a Nanodrop spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific), and the solution was aliquoted and stored at â80 Â°C until use. To minimize electrostatic interference between NSs and microtubules, NSs were coated with oligolysine conjugated to polyethylene glycol (K10â PEG5K, purchased from Alamanda Polymers)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup> as follows. 10 microliters of 4.2 nM NSs were mixed with 0.45 ÂµL of K10âPEG5K at a concentration corresponding to an N:P ratio (ratio of nitrogen in amines to phosphates in DNA) of 0.5:1.

<title>Single molecule experiment on kinesin-NS conjugates</title>
<p>A flow chamber was constructed from two uncoated coverslips of different sizes: an 18 mm Ã 18 mm coverslip (2918COVER18-18, Iwaki) was placed on top, and a 24 mm Ã 24 mm coverslip (C024241, Matsunami) was placed at the bottom, separated by two spacers of â¼50 <italic>Î¼</italic>m thickness, resulting in a volume of approximately 10 Âµl. Unless otherwise noted, the assay buffer was the SRP90 buffer supplemented with 20 ÂµM Taxol, 0.4 mM 2-mercaptoethanol (131-14572, FUJIFILM), and 0.2 mg/mL casein (C5890-500G, Sigma-Aldrich). Microtubules were diluted in the buffer (without casein), and flowed into the chamber, allowing them to attach to the glass surface of the chamber through non-specific interaction during a 5-minute incubation. Then, the chamber was incubated with the blocking buffer (assay buffer containing 0.5 mg/mL casein) for 5 minutes to prevent nonspecific binding, during which microtubules that did not adhere to the glass surface were washed away using the blocking buffer. Next, the assay buffer containing kinesin-NS conjugates was flowed into the chamber, followed by a 5-minute incubation to allow the kinesin-NS conjugates to attach to the microtubules. Finally, the assay buffer, additionally supplemented with 1 mM ATP, 3 mg/mL glucose, 0.1 mg/mL glucose oxidase, and 0.02 mg/mL catalase, was flowed into the chamber. Note that the latter three regents are an oxygen scavenger system for fluorescence antifade protection. This step allowed for the removal of kinesin-NS conjugates that had not attached to the microtubules. Finally, to prevent the evaporation of the buffer inside the chamber during the experiment, the open ends of the flow chamber were sealed with clear nail polish. The motion of kinesin-NS conjugates was observed using a fluorescence microscope (IX83, EVIDENT) equipped with a 100Ã oil immersion objective lens (UPlanFL N 100Ã/1.30 Oil, EVIDENT) and a fluorescence mirror unit (TRITC-B, Semrock), and was recorded at 33 frames per second (fps) with an effective pixel size of 65 nm by a CMOS camera (ORCA-Flash4.0, Hamamatsu Photonics). Experiments were also performed at 100 fps in addition to the recording rate of 33 fps (Supplementary Information).

<p>This manuscript describes a novel method for determining the mechanical parameters of the kinesin, KIF1A, that uses fluorescence microscopy and does not require an optical tweezer apparatus. The length of a tethered fluorescent DNA nanospring is measured as the kinesin moves processively along the microtubule and then stalls. The work reports <bold>important</bold> findings, and (barring a few exceptions) the evidence supporting the claims is generally <bold>convincing</bold>.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This study uses a novel DNA origami nanospring to measure the stall force and other mechanical parameters of the kinesin-3 family member, KIF1A, using light microscopy. The key is to use SNAP tags to tether a defined nanospring between a motor-dead mutant of KIF5B and the KIF1A to be integrated. The mutant KIF5B binds tightly to a subunit of the microtubule without stepping, thus creating resistance to the processive advancement of the active KIF1A. The nanospring is conjugated with 124 Cy3 dyes, which allows it to be imaged by fluorescence microscopy. Acoustic force spectroscopy was used to measure the relationship between the extension of the NS and force as a calibration. Two different fitting methods are described to measure the length of the extension of the NS from its initial diffraction-limited spot. By measuring the extension of the NS during an experiment, the authors can determine the stall force. The attachment duration of the active motor is measured from the suppression of lateral movement that occurs when the KIF1A is attached and moving. There are numerous advantages of this technology for the study of single molecules of kinesin over previous studies using optical tweezers. First, it can be done using simple fluorescence microscopy and does not require the level of sophistication and expense needed to construct an optical tweezer apparatus. Second, the force that is experienced by the moving KIF1A is parallel to the plane of the microtubule. This regime can be achieved using a dual beam optical tweezer set-up, but in the more commonly used single-beam set-up, much of the force experienced by the kinesin is perpendicular to the microtubule. Recent studies have shown markedly different mechanical behaviors of kinesin when interrogated by the two different optical tweezer configurations. The data in the current manuscript are consistent with those obtained using the dual-beam optical tweezer set-up. In addition, the authors study the mechanical behavior of several mutants of KIF1A that are associated with KIF1A-associated neurological disorder (KAND).</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The technique should be cheaper and less technically challenging than optical tweezer microscopy to measure the mechanical parameters of molecular motors. The method is described in sufficient detail to allow its use in other labs. It should have a higher throughput than other methods.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The experimenter does not get a &quot;real-time&quot; view of the data as it is collected, which you get from the screen of an optical tweezer set-up. Rather, you have to put the data through the fitting routines to determine the length of the nanospring in order to generate the graphs of extension (force) vs time. No attempts were made to analyze the periods where the motor is actually moving to determine step-size or force-velocity relationships.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This work is important because it complements other single-molecule mechanics approaches, in particular optical trapping, which inevitably exerts off-axis loads. The nanospring method has its own weaknesses (individual steps cannot be seen), but it brings new clarity to our picture of KIF1A and will influence future thinking on the kinesins-3 and on kinesins in general.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>By tethering single copies of the kinesin-3 dimer under test via a DNA nanospring to a strong binding mutant dimer of kinesin-1, the forces developed and experienced by the motor are constrained into a single axis, parallel to the microtubule axis. The method is imaging-based, which should improve accessibility. In principle, at least, several single-motor molecules can be simultaneously tested. The arrangement ensures that only single molecules can contribute. Controls establish that the DNA nanospring is not itself interacting appreciably with the microtubule. Forces are convincingly calibrated, and reading the length of the nanospring by fitting to the oblate fluorescent spot is carefully validated. The excursions of the wild-type KIF1A leucine zipper-stabilised dimer are compared with those of neuropathic KIF1A mutants. These mutants can walk to a stall plateau, but the force is much reduced. The forces from mutant/WT heterodimers are also reduced.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The tethered nanospring method has some weaknesses; it only allows the stall force to be measured in the case that a stall plateau is achieved, and the thermal noise means that individual steps are not apparent. The nanospring does not behave like a Hookean spring - instead linearly increasing force is reported by exponentially smaller extensions of the nanospring under tension. The estimated stall force for Kif1A (3.8 pN) is in line with measurements made using 3-bead optical trapping, but those earlier measurements were not of a stall plateau, but rather of limiting termination (detachment) force, without a stall plateau. More confidence in the 3.7 pN stall plateau determined in the current work could be obtained by demonstrating that a stall at a higher force is obtained using the nanospring method on kinesin-1, which stalls at &gt;7 pN in single bead optical trapping.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>We greatly appreciate Reviewer #1âs accurate public review of our study on the kinesin motor using the DNA origami nanospring (NS). With respect to the strengths, we fully agree with Reviewer #1âs comments. Regarding the weakness, we would like to respond as follows.</p>
<p>It is true that, unlike optical tweezers, our method does not provide real-time data display. Optical tweezers enable real-time observation and manipulation of kinesin molecules at arbitrary time points. Achieving real-time observation and manipulation is indeed an important challenge for the future development of the NS technique. On the other hand, Iwaki et al. (our co-corresponding author) has already investigated dynamic properties of motor proteins under load, such as step size and forceâvelocity relationship of myosin VI using NS. We are now preparing high spatiotemporal resolution microscopy experiments on the KIF1A system to measure its step size and forceâvelocity relationship, which inherently require such resolution.</p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>We would like to thank Reviewer #2 for providing a highly accurate assessment of the strengths of our experiments. Regarding the weaknesses, we would like to respond as follows.</p>
<p>First, Iwaki et al. (our co-corresponding author) have already succeeded in observing the stepping motion of myosin VI using the nanospring (NS) in their previous work. We are also currently preparing high spatiotemporal resolution microscopy experiments to observe the stepping motion of KIF1A in our system. Second, while it is true that the NS does not follow Hookeâs law, it is possible to design and construct NSs with an appropriate dynamic range by tuning the spring constant to match the forces exerted by protein molecules. Finally, we agree that our first observation of the stall plateau in KIF1A using the NS is a meaningful achievement. However, with respect to the suggestion that âincreasing validity requires also studying kinesin-1,â we have a somewhat different perspective. The validity of the NS method has already been thoroughly examined in the previous work on myosin VI by Iwaki et al., where results were compared with those obtained using optical tweezers. Moreover, the focus of this manuscript is on KAND caused by KIF1A mutations. From this perspective, although we appreciate the suggestion, we consider it important to keep the present study focused on KIF1A and its implications for KAND.</p>
