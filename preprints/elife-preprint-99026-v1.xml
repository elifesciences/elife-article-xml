<title>Abstract</title><p>The non-B DNA structures can act as dynamic functional genomic elements regulating gene expression. Among them, G4s and R-loops are two of the best studied. The interplay between R-loops and G4s are emerging in regulating DNA repair, replication and transcription. A comprehensive picture of native co-localized G4s and R-loops in living cells is currently lacking. Here, we describe the development of HepG4-seq and an optimized HBD-seq methods, which robustly capture native G4s and R-loops, respectively, in living cells. We successfully employed these methods to establish comprehensive maps of native co-localized G4s and R-loops in human HEK293 cells and mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs). We discovered that co-localized G4s and R-loops are dynamically altered in a cell type-dependent manner and are largely localized at active promoters and enhancers of transcriptional active genes. We further demonstrated the helicase Dhx9 as a direct and major regulator that modulates the formation and resolution of co-localized G4s and R-loops. Depletion of Dhx9 impaired the self-renewal and differentiation capacities of mESCs by altering the transcription of co-localized G4s and R-loops - associated genes. Taken together, our work established that the endogenous co-localized G4s and R-loops are prevalently persisted in the regulatory regions of active genes and are involved in the transcriptional regulation of their linked genes, opening the door for exploring broader roles of co-localized G4s and R-loops in development and disease.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Genomic DNA can form various types of non-B secondary structures, including G-quadruplexes (G4s), R-loops, Z-DNA, i-motifs, Cruciform and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Matos-Rodrigues et al., 2023</xref>). Among them, G4s and R-loops are two of the best studied. G4s are built by stacked guanine tetrads connected via Hoogsteen hydrogen bonds and can be formed by intra- or inter-molecular folding of the tetramers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Panyutin et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Sen and Gilbert, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Sundquist and Klug, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Williamson et al., 1989</xref>). R-loops are three-stranded structures containing a DNA-RNA hybrid and a displaced single-stranded DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Aguilera and Garcia-Muse, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Xu and Clayton, 1996</xref>). Both G4s and R-loops are involved in key biological processes, including transcription, replication, genomic instability, class switch recombination in B cells, DNA damage and repair, and telomere maintenance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Garcia-Muse and Aguilera, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Robert Hänsel-Hertsch, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Varshney et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">Yang et al., 2023</xref>).</p>
<p>R-loops appear to have a strong sequence preference with high G/C ratios (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Ginno et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Ginno et al., 2012</xref>). Reports about the interplay between R-loops and G4s are emerging. Specific G4 ligands stabilized G4s and simultaneously increase R-loop levels within minutes in human cancer cells, which finally induced DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">De Magis et al., 2019</xref>). Reactive oxygen species (ROS) have been reported to induce G4 and R-loop formation at transcriptionally active sites, and their inter-regulation is essential for the DNA repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Tan et al., 2020</xref>). In a reconstituted eukaryotic DNA replication system, the interplay of R-loops and G4s was shown to impact replication fork progression by inducing fork stalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Kumar et al., 2021</xref>). Single-molecule fluorescence studies showed the existence of a positive feedback mechanism of G4 and R-loop formation during transcription, where the transcription-induced R-loop precedes and facilitates G4 formation in the non-template strand, and in turn G4 promotes the R-loop formation in the following rounds of transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Lee et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Lim and Hohng, 2020</xref>). Wulfridge et al. reported that the architectural protein CCCTC binding factor (CTCF)-bound sites are enriched for R-loops and G4s which facilitate CTCF binding to promote chromatin looping interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Wulfridge et al., 2023</xref>).</p>
<p>Detection of G4s and R-loops have been largely based on the use of a single-chain variable fragment (scFv) BG4 for G4s and a monoclonal antibody S9.6 for R-loops. In recent years, these two affinity probe have been coupled with deep sequencing to genome-widely detect G4s and R-loops (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Galli et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Ginno et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Hänsel-Hertsch et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Jiang et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Lyu et al., 2021</xref>). Using BG4 and S9.6 -based CUT &amp; Tag, G4s and R-loops showed high degree of co-occurrence in mESCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Lyu et al., 2021</xref>). However, given that a group of helicases, RNA-binding factors, endonucleases and DNA topoisomerases cooperate to actively dissolve G4s and R-loops restoring B-formed DNA duplexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Robert Hänsel-Hertsch, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Varshney et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">Yang et al., 2023</xref>), a steady state equilibrium is generally set at low levels in living cells under physiological conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Miglietta et al., 2020</xref>) and thus addition of high affinity antibodies may pull the equilibrium towards folded states. Additionally, the specificity of the S9.6 antibody on R-loops has been questioned recently for accurate quantification and mapping of R-loops (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Hartono et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Konig et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Phillips et al., 2013</xref>).</p>
<p>To understand the co-localized G4s and R-loops in living cells under physiological conditions, we sought to develop an <italic>in vivo</italic> strategy for G4 profiling based on the G4-hemin complex-induced proximal labeling and R-loop profiling based on the N-terminal hybrid-binding domain (HBD) of RNase H1. Recent studies showed that G4s could tightly form a complex with the cellular cofactor hemin both <italic>in vitro</italic> and in living cells, where hemin binds by end-stacking on the terminal G-quartets of G4s without affecting the folding of G4s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Gray et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Stadlbauer et al., 2021</xref>). The G4-hemin complex has been shown to act as a peroxidase to catalyze oxidation reactions in the presence of hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Cheng et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Lat et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">Yang et al., 2011</xref>). The H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-activated G4-hemin complex oxidizes the biotin tyramide to phenoxyl redicals that covalently conjugate biotin to G4 itself and its proximal DNA within 10 nm (equivalent to approximately 31 bp) <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Einarson and Sen, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Lat et al., 2020</xref>). Here, we have utilized the G4-hemin-mediated proximal biotinylation rection to develop a new method HepG4-seq (for high throughput <bold>seq</bold>uencing of <bold>he</bold>min-induced <bold>p</bold>roximal labelled <bold>G4</bold>s) to map the genomic native G4s under physiological conditions. The HBD domain of RNase H1 mediates the specific recognition of DNA/RNA hybrid in a sequence-independent manner, which is a gold standard for R-loop recognition in the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Nowotny et al., 2008</xref>). The catalytically inactive RNase H1 or its HBD domain -based methods have been successfully used to identify genome-wide native R-loops (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Chen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Wang et al., 2021</xref>). We have adapted the “GST-His6-2xHBD”-mediated CUT&amp;Tag protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Wang et al., 2021</xref>) to develop the HBD-seq protocol in this study.</p>
<p>We have combined the HepG4-seq and HBD-seq to profile the genome-wide native co-localized G4s and R-loops with high signal-to-noise ratios in HEK293 cells and mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs). We observed that the co-localized G4s and R-loops exhibit cell type-dependent distributions and are largely localized at active promoters and enhancers of transcriptionally active genes. We further showed that ∼70% of the co-localized G4s and R-loops in mESCs were directly bound by the helicase Dhx9 and that depletion of Dhx9 significantly altered the levels of ∼6200 co-localized G4s and R-loops bound by Dhx9. Furthermore, depletion of Dhx9 was shown to impair the self-renewal and differentiation capacities of mESCs by altering the transcription of co-localized G4s and R-loops -associated genes.</p>

<title>Mapping of the native DNA G4 through the G4-hemin-mediated proximal biotinylation</title>
<p>The DNA G4-hemin complex could act as a mimic peroxidase to oxidize the biotin tyramide to phenoxyl radicals that can covalently conjugate biotin to G4 itself and its proximal DNA within ∼30bp in the presence of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Cheng et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Einarson and Sen, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Lat et al., 2020</xref>). However, the efficiency of peroxidase-mediated biotinylation on DNA is limited using the substrate biotin tyramide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">Zhou et al., 2019</xref>). Recently, biotin aniline (Bio-An) has been shown to have superior labeling efficiency on DNA than biotin tyramide, when catalyzed by the engineered peroxidase APEX2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">Zhou et al., 2019</xref>). The free heme concentration in normal human erythrocytes is 21 ± 2 µM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Aich et al., 2015</xref>). To explore the G4-hemin-mediated biotinylation in the living cells, we treated HEK293 cells with 25 µM hemin and 500 µM Bio-An for 2 hours prior to activation with 1mM H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> for 1 minute, and then quenched the labeling reaction and performed the immunofluorescence staining using Alexa Fluor 647 conjugated recombinant streptavidin (Strep-647) that specifically recognizes biotin. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1A</xref>, cells treated with hemin and Bio-An exhibited a robust fluorescence signal, while the absence of either hemin or Bio-An almost completely abolished the biotinylation signals, suggesting a specific and active biotinylation activity. To understand whether addition of hemin disturbs the formation of G4s, we performed the BG4 CUT&amp;Tag-seq using the recombinant BG4 and Tn5 on HEK293 cells treated with and without 25 µM hemin (Supplementary Fig. 1A, B). The heatmap and profile plot analysis showed similar BG4 CUT&amp;Tag signals between the hemin-treated and control samples (Supplementary Fig. 1B). There were only 174 BG4 CUT&amp;Tag peaks with significantly differential signals between the hemin-treated and control samples (Supplementary Fig. 1C). These data suggest that the hemin treatment condition we used does not significantly affect G4 folding. Therefore, hemin-induced proximal biotinylation of G4s could be utilized to mark the native G4s in living cells.</p>

<p>The recombinant streptavidin monomer (mSA) combines the streptavidin and rhizavidin sequences to achieve specific monovalent detection of biotin or biotinylated molecules with a high affinity (Kd= 2.8 nM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Lim et al., 2013</xref>). The Moon-tag system consists of a 15-amino acid peptide GP41-tag and a 123-amino acid anti-GP41-tag nanobody with an affinity of ∼30 nM <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Boersma et al., 2019</xref>). We expressed and purified the recombinant mSA fused with the anti-GP41 nanobody (mSA-scFv), and the recombinant Tn5 fused with the GP41-tag and protein G (GP41-pG-Tn5) from <italic>E. coli</italic> (Supplementary Fig. 1A). To map the hemin-induced biotinylated G4s, we developed a new method HepG4-seq (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1B</xref>), where mSA-scFv recognizes the biotinylated G4s and recruits the transposase Tn5 to achieve “Cleavage Under Targets and Tagmentation (CUT&amp;Tag)”. Deep sequencing analysis of the biotinylated G4s fragments identified 6,799 consensus peaks from two independent biological repeats in HEK293 cells, where the signals were dramatically diminished in HEK293 cells without treatment with hemin and Bio-An, suggesting the specificity of HepG4-seq (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1C</xref>, Supplementary Table 1). Several representative HepG4s-seq-identified G4 peaks were shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1D</xref>. Genomic distribution analysis showed that G4s are mainly localized in promoters (38.7%) and gene bodies (47.1%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1E</xref>).</p>
<p>We also evaluated the HepG4-seq-identified peaks using a G4-froming sequences (PQS) predication tool pqsfinder which has been shown to have 96% accuracy on ∼400 known and experimentally observed G4 structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Hon et al., 2017</xref>). The peaks identified by HepG4-seq overlap quite well with the center of pqsfinder maxScores that report the PQS quality (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1C-D</xref>). The motif enrichment analysis by HOMER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Heinz et al., 2010</xref>) revealed a high prevalence of G-rich sequences in HepG4-seq peaks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1F</xref>). All above further validated the specificity of HepG4-seq in capturing G4s.</p>

The small molecules ML216 and NSC617145 are selective and cell permeable inhibitors of BLM and WRN, respectively, by inhibiting their ATPase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Aggarwal et al., 2013a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Aggarwal et al., 2013b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Nguyen et al., 2013</xref>). To investigate the effect of BLM or WRN inhibition on native G4s, we treated HEK293 cells with ML216 or NSC617145 for 16 hours and then labeled cellular G4s by hemin-G4-induced biotinylation in living cells. Immunofluorescence staining of the treated cells using Strep-647 showed that the treatment of ML216 or NSC617145 remarkably elevated signals of native G4s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1G</xref>). Furthermore, we performed HepG4-seq on HEK293 cells treated with ML216 or NSC617145. Notably, HepG4-seq identified 77,003 peaks from ML216- or NSC617145-treated HEK293 cells, and ∼ 70,000 new G4 peaks were induced by inhibition of BLM or WRN (Supplementary Table 1). The signals of G4s detected by HepG4-seq were significantly increased after inhibiting BLM or WRN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1H-I</xref>). Representative G4s peaks are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1J</xref>. Taken together, these data suggest that HepG4-seq is able to efficiently detect dynamic native G4s.</p>

<title>Mapping of native co-localized G4s and R-loops in HEK293 cells</title>
<p>The HBD domain of RNase H1 has been demonstrated as a DNA/RNA hybrid recognition sensor and applied to identify genome-wide native DNA/RNA hybrids using the recombinant GST-His6-2xHBD coupling with Tn5-based CUT&amp;Tag (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Nowotny et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Wang et al., 2021</xref>). Given that the GST-fusion proteins are prone to form variable high molecular-weight aggregates and these aggregates often undermine the reliability of the fusion proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Deceglie et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Ki and Pack, 2020</xref>), we produced the recombinant two copies of HBDs fused with EGFP and V5-tag (HBD-V5) (Supplementary Fig. 1A) and used the anti-V5 tag antibody instead of the anti-His tag antibody for the CUT&amp;Tag-seq. We call this modified protocol as HBD-seq for mapping the native R-loops in cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2A</xref>). We performed the HBD-seq on HEK293 cells, and revealed 42,488 consensus native R-loops peaks with a high signal-to-noise ratio while the HBD-seq signals were dramatically diminished in HEK293 cells treated with the RNases prior to HBD-seq (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2B</xref>), suggesting the specificity of HBD-seq in detecting native R-loops.</p>

<title>The co-localized G4s and R-loops-mediated transcriptional regulation in HEK293 cells</title>
<p>The predominant distribution of co-localized peaks around TSS implies that they may participate in transcriptional regulation of their associated genes. RNA-seq analysis revealed that the RNA levels of co-localized G4s and R-loops-associated genes are significantly higher (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). Different from G4s and R-loops, the co-localized G4s and R-loops are mainly localized within 1 kb of the TSS of transcriptionally active genes (∼60% peaks with FPKM &gt;=5) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>). To investigate the transcriptional regulation of co-localized G4s and R-loops in living cells, we performed the RNA-seq on HEK293 cells treated with and without ML216 or NSC617145 and then analyzed the differential gene expression using DESeq2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Love et al., 2014</xref>). As a result, hundreds of genes were linked to co-localized G4s and R-loops with increased G4 signals (at least 1.5 foldchange) and at the same time exhibited significant changes in expression levels upon inhibition of BLM or WRN in HEK293 cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>), suggesting that co-localized G4s and R-loops could regulate the transcription of their associated genes. Distribution analysis showed that these differential co-localized G4s and R-loops are mainly localized in the promoter-TSS (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>). Among the differential genes, 125 genes were co-regulated by both ML216 and NSC617145 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E</xref>), suggesting that BLM and WRN could co-regulate the transcription of genes by resolving G4s. Gene ontology (GO) analysis showed that co-localized G4s &amp; R-loops-regulated genes in HEK293 cells are mainly involved in cell cycle regulation, DNA/mRNA metabolic regulation, DNA damage response, chromatin binding, kinase binding, cell-substrate junction, et al (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3F</xref>).</p>

<title>Characterization of native co-localized G4s and R-loops in mESCs</title>
<p>Similar to HEK293 cells, the RNA levels of co-localized G4s and R-loops-associated genes were seen to be significantly higher in mESCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5A</xref>). However, unlike in HEK293 cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>), the overlapping peaks in mESCs are mainly localized in the proximal promoters (1kb from TSS, 9063 peaks with FPKM &gt;=5) and the region 5-50 kb from the TSS of transcriptionally active genes (32690 peaks with FPKM &gt;=5) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5B</xref>), suggesting that co-localized G4s and R-loops are possibly distributed in active promoters or enhancers.

Notably, 20,741 and 19,726 co-localized G4s and R-loops are found in promoters and enhancers, respectively; 18,496 peaks are seen in active promoters; 15,787 peaks are seen in active enhancers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5D</xref>, Supplementary Table 2).

The co-localization of G4s, R-loops and RNAP at active promoters suggests that co-localized G4s and R-loops are likely linked to promoter-associated nascent RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Core et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Li and Fu, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Preker et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Seila et al., 2008</xref>). Interestingly, a medium level of H3K4me1 is present in a bimodal pattern beside co-localized G4s and R-loops at active promoters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5E</xref>). The co-localized G4s and R-loops in bivalent promoters exhibit low signals of both G4s and R-loops, and overlap with a high level of H3K27me3, a medium level of H3K4me1, and a low level of H3K4m3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5E</xref>). The co-localized G4s and R-loops in active enhancers exhibit sharp peaks and well overlap with H3K27ac, H3K4me1, H3K4me3 and RNAP; the co-localized G4s and R-loops in poised enhancers enrich the active histone marks H3K4me1 and H3K4me3, and the repressive mark H3K27me3 while the signal of RNAP is very low (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5F</xref>). The unmarked enhancers-associated co-localized G4s and R-loops show low levels of all marks tested. Given that enhancer RNAs (eRNAs) have been widely identified as non-coding RNAs in enhancers and are functionally important for enhancer activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Andersson et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Kim et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Sigova et al., 2015</xref>), the co-occupacy of eRNAs are likely involved in the formation of co-localized G4s and R-loops in enhancers and shed light on the new regulatory mechanism of eRNA action.</p>

<p>Given that co-localized G4s and R-loops have been shown to be enriched in active promoters and enhancers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5D-F</xref>), the loss-of-Dhx9-induced differential co-localized G4s and R-loops preferentially localize in the active and bivalent promoters and all three types of enhancers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6E</xref>). To explore the effect of Dhx9 on the transcription of co-localized G4s and R-loops -associated genes, we performed the RNA-seq on wild-type and <italic>dhx9<sup>KO</sup></italic>mESCs. Differential gene expression analysis revealed 1647 significantly up-regulated genes and 1916 significantly down-regulated genes in absence of Dhx9 (Supplementary Fig. 3C-D). Importantly, loss of Dhx9 resulted in hundreds of G4-, R-loop-, and G4&amp;R-loop-associated genes with significantly differential expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6F</xref>), suggesting that Dhx9 could regulate transcription by modulating G4s, R-loops and co-localized G4s and R-loops. Representative Dhx9-regulated locus are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6G</xref>. GO analysis showed that co-localized G4s and R-loops-associated genes that showed differential expression after knocking out Dhx9 are mainly involved in negative regulation of cell differentiation, head development, positive regulation of cell motility, DNA-binding transcription activator activity, pattern specification process, embryonic organ morphogenesis, et al., suggesting that Dhx9 may regulate the cell fate of mESCs by modulating co-localized G4s and R-loops (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6H</xref>). Coinciding with GO analysis, Dhx9 knockout in the mouse causes embryonic lethality and Dhx9 knockdown leads to large structural changes in chromatin and eventually cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">He et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">Zhang et al., 2004</xref>).

<title>Characterization of co-localized G4s and R-loops directly bound by Dhx9</title>
<p>Tens of helicases or regulators have been reported to directly resolve or stabilize G4s or R-loops (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Mendoza et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Varshney et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">Yang et al., 2023</xref>). Interestingly, loss of Dhx9 caused 30 of these helicases/regulators to be significantly differentially expressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7A</xref>) and Dhx9 physically interacts with at least ten of them based on the STRING protein-protein interaction network database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Szklarczyk et al., 2023</xref>) (Supplementary Fig. 3E). These data suggest that Dhx9 could also indirectly modulate G4s and R-loops by affecting other helicases or regulators. Thus, to explore the direct target co-localized G4s and R-loops of Dhx9, we performed the CUT&amp;Tag-seq using the Dhx9 antibody (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Kaya-Okur et al., 2019</xref>) and revealed 54,982 Dhx9 binding peaks in wild-type mESCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7B</xref>). Notably, 65.5% Dhx9 binding peaks well overlapped with 69.9% co-localized G4s and R-loops in mESCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7C-D</xref>), suggesting that Dhx9 is a direct and major regulator of co-localized G4s and R-loops in mESCs. Motif analysis showed that G-rich sequences are highly enriched in the Dhx9 binding peaks overlapping with co-localized G4s and R-loops in mESCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7E</xref>), further demonstrating that Dhx9 directly bind to co-localized G4s and R-loops that harbor G-rich sequences as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4G</xref>.</p>

<p>We next compared the Dhx9-bound co-localized G4s and R-loops in wild-type and <italic>dhx9<sup>KO</sup></italic> mESCs, and identified 1,382 significantly up-regulated peaks (823 with increased G4s and 559 with increased R-loops) and 4,789 significantly down-regulated peaks (2,278 with decreased G4s and 2,511 with decreased R-loops) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7F</xref>, Supplementary Fig. 3F), accounting for ∼50-75% of differential co-localized G4s and R-loops in absence of Dhx9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6C</xref>). Analysis of the genomic distribution of Dhx9-bound differential co-localized G4s and R-loops found that these peaks are mainly localize in the active and bivalent promoters and all three types of enhancers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7G</xref>). The Dhx9-bound differential co-localized G4s and R-loops were linked to 852 genes with significantly differential expression (Supplementary Fig. 3G, Supplementary table 2), which are enriched in GO terms related to pattern specification, cell junction organization, brain development, negative regulation of cell differentiation, mesenchyme/mesoderm development, embryonic morphogenesis, et al. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7H</xref>). Several key regulators of mouse embryonic stem cell and embryonic development, such as Nanog, Lin28a, Bmp4, Wnt8a, Gata2, and Lef1, were shown to be transcriptionally regulated by Dhx9 through direct modulation of their associated G4s and R-loops (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7I</xref>). These data suggest that Dhx9 significantly contributes to transcriptional regulation of co-localized G4s and R-loops -associated genes.</p>

<title>Dhx9 regulates the cell fate of mESCs</title>
<p>To understand the role of Dhx9 in regulating the cell fate of mESCs, we first examined the RNA levels of several key genes that maintain the pluripotency of mESCs by quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) and found that the RNA levels of Lin28a and Oct4 were significantly decreased and the RNA level of Nanog was significantly increased when Dhx9 was knocked out (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8A</xref>). Western blot assay showed that <italic>dhx9<sup>KO</sup></italic> mESCs produce obviously lower level of Lin28a protein than wild-type mESCs, consistent with its RNA level, whereas in contrast to the RNA level, the protein level of Nanog was significantly decreased in <italic>dhx9<sup>KO</sup></italic> mESCs, suggesting that Dhx9 directly or indirectly modulates the translation of Nanog (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8B</xref>).

The mESCs can be maintained in a proliferative state for prolonged periods, which was known as “self-renewal” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Liang and Zhang, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Murry and Keller, 2008</xref>).

<p>mESCs are pluripotent stem cells which are able to differentiate into three germ lineages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Murry and Keller, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">Young, 2011</xref>). In the absence of differentiation inhibitor LIF, mESCs cultured in suspension spontaneously form three-dimensional aggregates called embryoid bodies (EBs), which could recapitulate many aspects of early embryogenesis, including the induction of three early germ lineages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Simunovic and Brivanlou, 2017</xref>). To understand role of Dhx9 in regulating the pluripotency of mESCs, we performed the EB assay using the wild-type and <italic>dhx9<sup>KO</sup></italic> mESCs. As the EB differentiation progressed, loss of Dhx9 resulted in apparently smaller and fewer EBs than wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8F</xref>). At the same time, we collected EBs at different days of EB differentiation and examined the RNA levels of well-known markers of three germ lineages by qRT-PCR. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8G</xref>, all maker genes tested displayed significantly differential expression, suggesting that Dhx9 regulates the pluripotency of mESCs, which is in line with the GO enrichment results of Dhx9-regulated co-localized G4s and R-loops-associated genes in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7H</xref>. Taken together, Dhx9 regulates the self-renewal and differentiation capacities of mESCs.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we developed the new method “HepG4-seq” and optimized the RNase H1 HBD domain-based HBD-seq to robustly map endogenous G4s and R-loops, respectively, in living cells with high specificity. Using the HepG4-seq and HBD-seq, we systematically characterized the native co-localized G4s and R-loops in HEK293 cells and mESCs, and revealed that co-localized G4s and R-loops are dynamically altered in a cell type-dependent way and largely localized at active promoters and enhancers of transcriptional active genes. Small molecules-induced inhibition of helicases BLM or WRN resulted in significant accumulation of G4s within co-localized G4s and R-loops and at the same time leaded to genes with significantly differential expression in HEK293 cells that are enriched in the processes related to cell cycle, DNA metabolic, DNA damage response, chromatin binding, et al. Furthermore, we characterized the helicase Dhx9 as a key regulator of co-localized G4s and R-loops which efficiently unwinds or promotes co-localized G4s and R-loops, and illustrated that depletion of Dhx9 significantly altered the transcription of co-localized G4s and R-loops-associated genes that are enriched in embryonic development, cell differentiation and germ lineage development, et al. Therefore, loss of Dhx9 apparently impaired the self-renewal and pluripotency of mESCs.</p>
<p>In this study, we utilized a low dosage of hemin, similar to the physiological concentration in normal human erythrocytes, to spark the peroxidase activity of endogenous G4s without significantly altering the levels of native G4s (Supplementary Fig. 1B-C) and further robustly biotinylated G4s themselves by G4-hermin complex-mediated proximity labeling in just one minute in living cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Cheng et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Einarson and Sen, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Lat et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Li et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Stadlbauer et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">Yang et al., 2011</xref>). In consideration of the high affinity and specificity, the recombinant streptavidin monomer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Lim et al., 2013</xref>) is able to recognize the biotinylated G4s with high sensitivity and specificity and thereby yield robust CUT&amp;Tag signals with the help of Moon-tag system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Boersma et al., 2019</xref>). Therefore, our HepG4-seq strategy is able to robustly and specifically capture native G4s. In HEK293 cells, HepG4-seq uncovered 6,799 consensus G4 peaks under wild-type status and 77,003 G4 peaks in the present of BLM/WRN inhibitors, suggesting that HepG4-seq is capable of detecting endogenous G4s with high sensitivity.</p>
<p>Notably, we also discovered that the native co-localized G4s and R-loops landscape is altered in a cell-dependent manner and that approximately 10 folds more peaks were observed in mESCs than in HEK293 cells, which reflects that co-localized G4s and R-loops have the potential to regulate the complex pluripotency network in mESCs. CTCF is a key regulator of genome organization and gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Ong and Corces, 2014</xref>). Recently, Wulfridge et al. reported that CTCF-bound regions are enriched for both R-loops and G4s and G4s associated with R-loops promote CTCF binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Wulfridge et al., 2023</xref>). Interestingly, the enriched motif with the most significant p-value in mESCs co-localized G4s and R-loops (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4G</xref>) well matches the motif of CTCF ChIP-seq, suggesting that co-localized G4s and R-loops may be able to modulate the CTCF binding.</p>
<p>Furthermore, while 47,857 co-localized G4s and R-loops are directly bound by Dhx9 in the wild-type mESCs (Supplementary Table 2), only 4,060 of them display significantly differential signals in absence of Dhx9, suggesting that redundant regulators exist. It is worth noting that depletion of Dhx9 significantly altered the transcription of 30 known G4s and/or R-loops helicases/regulators (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7A</xref>) and that half of these helicases/regulators are able to establish physical interaction network (Supplementary Fig. 3E). The multi-faceted pathways of modulating co-localized G4s and R-loops formation and resolution and the pivot of the complex regulatory network remain to be elucidated.</p>
<p>Taken together, our study provides new insights into exploring regulatory roles of co-localized G4s and R-loops in development and disease.</p>

<p>This <bold>useful</bold> study describes an antibody-free method to map G-quadruplexes (G4s) in vertebrate cells. While the method might have potential, the current analysis is primarily descriptive and does not add substantial new insights beyond existing data (e.g., PMID:34792172). While the datasets provided might constitute a good starting point for future functional studies, additional data and analyses would be needed to fully support the major conclusions and, at the same time, clarify the advantage of this method over other methods. Specifically, the strength of the evidence for DHX9 interfering with the ability of mESCs to differentiate by regulating directly the stability of either G4s or R-loops is still <bold>incomplete</bold>.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Non-B DNA structures such as G4s and R-loops have the potential to impact genome stability, gene transcription, and cell differentiation. This study investigates the distribution of G4s and R-loops in human and mouse cells using some interesting technical modifications of existing Tn5-based approaches. This work confirms that the helicase DHX9 could regulate the formation and/or stability of both structures in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs). It also provides evidence that the lack of DHX9 in mESCs interferes with their ability to differentiate.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>HepG4-seq, the new antibody-free strategy to map G4s based on the ability of Hemin to act as a peroxidase when complexed to G4s, is interesting. This study also provides more evidence that the distribution pattern of G4s and R-loops might vary substantially from one cell type to another.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>This study is essentially descriptive and does not provide conclusive evidence that lack of DHX9 does interfere with the ability of mESCs to differentiate by regulating directly the stability of either G4 or R-loops. In the end, it does not substantially improve our understanding of DHX9's mode of action.</p>
<p>There is no in-depth comparison of the newly generated data with existing datasets and no rigorous control was presented to test the specificity of the hemin-G4 interaction (a lot of the hemin-dependent signal seems to occur in the cytoplasm, which is unexpected).</p>
<p>The authors talk about co-occurrence between G4 and R-loops but their data does not actually demonstrate co-occurrence in time. If the same loci could form alternatively either R-loops or G4 and if DHX9 was somehow involved in determining the balance between G4s and R-loops, the authors would probably obtain the same distribution pattern. To manipulate R-loop levels in vivo and test how this affects HEPG4-seq signals would have been helpful.</p>
<p>This study relies exclusively on Tn5-based mapping strategies. This is a problem as global changes in DNA accessibility might strongly skew the results. It is unclear at this stage whether the lack of DHX9, BLM, or WRN has an impact on DNA accessibility, which might underlie the differences that were observed. Moreover, Tn5 cleaves DNA at a nearby accessible site, which might be at an unknown distance away from the site of interest. The spatial accuracy of Tn5-based methods is therefore debatable, which is a problem when trying to demonstrate spatial co-occurrence. Alternative mapping methods would have been helpful.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this study, Liu et al. explore the interplay between G-quadruplexes (G4s) and R-loops. The authors developed novel techniques, HepG4-seq and HBD-seq, to capture and map these nucleic acid structures genome-wide in human HEK293 cells and mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs). They identified dynamic, cell-type-specific distributions of co-localized G4s and R-loops, which predominantly localize at active promoters and enhancers of transcriptionally active genes. Furthermore, they assessed the role of helicase Dhx9 in regulating these structures and their impact on gene expression and cellular functions.</p>
<p>The manuscript provides a detailed catalogue of the genome-wide distribution of G4s and R-loops. However, the conceptual advance and the physiological relevance of the findings are not obvious. Overall, the impact of the work on the field is limited to the utility of the presented methods and datasets.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) The development and optimization of HepG4-seq and HBD-seq offer novel methods to map native G4s and R-loops.</p>
<p>(2) The study provides extensive data on the distribution of G4s and R-loops, highlighting their co-localization in human and mouse cells.</p>
<p>(3) The study consolidates the role of Dhx9 in modulating these structures and explores its impact on mESC self-renewal and differentiation.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) The specificity of the biotinylation process and potential off-target effects are not addressed. The authors should provide more data to validate the specificity of the G4-hemin.</p>
<p>(2) Other methods exploring a catalytic dead RNAseH or the HBD to pull down R-loops have been described before. The superior quality of the presented methods in comparison to existing ones is not established. A clear comparison with other methods (BG4 CUT&amp;Tag-seq, DRIP-seq, R-CHIP, etc) should be provided.</p>
<p>(3) Although the study demonstrates Dhx9's role in regulating co-localized G4s and R-loops, additional functional experiments (e.g., rescue experiments) are needed to confirm these findings.</p>
<p>(4) The manuscript would benefit from a more detailed discussion of the broader implications of co-localized G4s and R-loops.</p>
<p>(5) The manuscript lacks appropriate statistical analyses to support the major conclusions.</p>
<p>(6) The discussion could be expanded to address potential limitations and alternative explanations for the results.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors developed and optimized the methods for detecting G4s and R-loops independent of BG4 and S9.6 antibody, and mapped genomic native G4s and R-loops by HepG4-seq and HBD-seq, revealing that co-localized G4s and R-loops participate in regulating transcription and affecting the self-renewal and differentiation capabilities of mESCs.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>By utilizing the peroxidase activity of G4-hemin complex and combining proximity labeling technology, the authors developed HepG4-seq (high throughput sequencing of hemin-induced proximal labelled G4s) , which can detect the dynamics of G4s in vivo. Meanwhile, the &quot;GST-His6-2xHBD&quot;-mediated CUT&amp;Tag protocol (Wang et al., 2021) was optimized by replacing fusion protein and tag, the optimized HBD-seq avoids the generation of GST fusion protein aggregates and can reflect the genome-wide distribution of R-loops in vivo.</p>
<p>The authors employed HepG4-seq and HBD-seq to establish comprehensive maps of native co-localized G4s and R-loops in human HEK293 cells and mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs). The data indicate that co-localized G4s and R-loops are dynamically altered in a cell type-dependent manner and are largely localized at active promoters and enhancers of transcriptionally active genes.</p>
<p>Combined with Dhx9 ChIP-seq and co-localized G4s and R-loops data in wild-type and dhx9KO mESCs, the authors confirm that the helicase Dhx9 is a direct and major regulator that regulates the formation and resolution of co-localized G4s and R-loops.</p>
<p>Depletion of Dhx9 impaired the self-renewal and differentiation capacities of mESCs by altering the transcription of co-localized G4s and R-loops-associated genes.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the authors provide an approach to studying the interplay between G4s and R-loops, shedding light on the important roles of co-localized G4s and R-loops in development and disease by regulating the transcription of related genes.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>As we know, there are at least two structure data of S9.6 antibody very recently, and the questions about the specificity of the S9.6 antibody on RNA:DNA hybrids should be finished. The authors referred to (Hartono et al., 2018; Konig et al., 2017; Phillips et al., 2013) need to be updated, and the authors' bias against S9.6 antibodies needs also to be changed. However, as the authors had questioned the specificity of the S9.6 antibody, they should compare it in parallel with the data they have and the data generated by the widely used S9.6 antibody.</p>
<p>Although HepG4-seq is an effective G4s detection technique, and the authors have also verified its reliability to some extent, given the strong link between ROS homeostasis and G4s formation, and hemin's affinity for different types of G4s, whether HepG4-seq reflects the dynamics of G4s in vivo more accurately than existing detection techniques still needs to be more carefully corroborated.</p>

<p><bold>eLife assessment</bold></p>
<p>This useful study describes an antibody-free method to map G-quadruplexes (G4s) in vertebrate cells. While the method might have potential, the current analysis is primarily descriptive and does not add substantial new insights beyond existing data (e.g., PMID:34792172). While the datasets provided might constitute a good starting point for future functional studies, additional data and analyses would be needed to fully support the major conclusions and, at the same time, clarify the advantage of this method over other methods. Specifically, the strength of the evidence for DHX9 interfering with the ability of mESCs to differentiate by regulating directly the stability of either G4s or R-loops is still incomplete.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the editors for their helpful comments.</p>
<p>Given that antibody-based methods have been reported to leave open the possibility of recognizing partially folded G4s and promoting their folding, we have employed the peroxidase activity of the G4-hemin complex to develop a new method for capturing endogenous G4s that significantly reduces the risk of capturing partially folded G4s. We will be happy to clarify the advantage of our method.</p>
<p>In the Fig. 7, we applied the Dhx9 CUT&amp;Tag assay to identify the G4s and R-loops directly bound by Dhx9 and further characterized the differential Dhx9-bound G4s and R-loops in the absence of Dhx9. Dhx9 is a versatile helicase capable of directly resolving R-loops and G4s or promoting R-loop formation (PMID: 21561811, 30341290, 29742442, 32541651, 35905379, 34316718). Furthermore, we showed that depletion of Dhx9 significantly altered the levels of G4s or R-loops around the TSS or gene bodies of several key regulators of mESC and embryonic development, such as Nanog, Lin28a, Bmp4, Wnt8a, Gata2, and Lef1, and also their RNA levels (Fig.7 I). The above evidence is sufficient to support the transcriptional regulation of mESCs cell fate by directly modulating the G4s or R-loops within the key regulators of mESCs.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Non-B DNA structures such as G4s and R-loops have the potential to impact genome stability, gene transcription, and cell differentiation. This study investigates the distribution of G4s and R-loops in human and mouse cells using some interesting technical modifications of existing Tn5-based approaches. This work confirms that the helicase DHX9 could regulate the formation and/or stability of both structures in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs). It also provides evidence that the lack of DHX9 in mESCs interferes with their ability to differentiate.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>HepG4-seq, the new antibody-free strategy to map G4s based on the ability of Hemin to act as a peroxidase when complexed to G4s, is interesting. This study also provides more evidence that the distribution pattern of G4s and R-loops might vary substantially from one cell type to another.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate your valuable points.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>This study is essentially descriptive and does not provide conclusive evidence that lack of DHX9 does interfere with the ability of mESCs to differentiate by regulating directly the stability of either G4 or R-loops. In the end, it does not substantially improve our understanding of DHX9's mode of action.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In this study, we aimed to report new methods for capturing endogenous G4s and R-loops in living cells. Dhx9 has been reported to directly unwind R-loops and G4s or promote R-loop formation (PMID: 21561811, 30341290, 29742442, 32541651, 35905379, 34316718). To understand the direct Dhx9-bound G4s and R-loops, we performed the Dhx9 CUT&amp;Tag assay and analyzed the co-localization of Dhx9-binding sites and G4s or R-loops. We found that 47,857 co-localized G4s and R-loops are directly bound by Dhx9 in the wild-type mESCs and 4,060 of them display significantly differential signals in absence of Dhx9, suggesting that redundant regulators exist as well. We showed that depletion of Dhx9 significantly altered the RNA levels of several key regulators of mESC and embryonic development, such as Nanog, Lin28a, Bmp4, Wnt8a, Gata2, and Lef1, which coincides with the significantly differential levels of G4s or R-loops around the TSS or gene bodies of these genes (Fig.7). The comprehensive molecular mechanism of Dhx9 action is indeed not the focus of this study. We will work on it in the future studies. Thank you for the comments.</p>

<p>There is no in-depth comparison of the newly generated data with existing datasets and no rigorous control was presented to test the specificity of the hemin-G4 interaction (a lot of the hemin-dependent signal seems to occur in the cytoplasm, which is unexpected).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The specificity of hemin-G4-induced peroxidase activity and self-biotinylation has been well demonstrated in previous studies (PMID: 19618960, 22106035, 28973477, 32329781). In the Fig.1A, we compared the hemin-G4-induced biotinylation levels in different conditions. Cells treated with hemin and Bio-An exhibited a robust fluorescence signal, while the absence of either hemin or Bio-An almost completely abolished the biotinylation signals, suggesting a specific and active biotinylation activity. To identify the specific signals, we have included the non-label control and used this control to call confident HepG4 peaks in all HepG4-seq assays.</p>
<p>The hemin-RNA G4 complex has also been reported to have mimic peroxidase activity and trigger similar self-biotinylation signals as DNA G4s (PMID: 32329781, 31257395, 27422869). Therefore, it is not surprising to observe hemin-dependent signals in the cytoplasm generated by cytoplasmic RNA G4s.</p>
<p>In the revised version, we will include careful comparison between our data and previous datasets.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The authors talk about co-occurrence between G4 and R-loops but their data does not actually demonstrate co-occurrence in time. If the same loci could form alternatively either R-loops or G4 and if DHX9 was somehow involved in determining the balance between G4s and R-loops, the authors would probably obtain the same distribution pattern. To manipulate R-loop levels in vivo and test how this affects HEPG4-seq signals would have been helpful.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Single-molecule fluorescence studies have shown the existence of a positive feedback mechanism of G4 and R-loop formation during transcription (PMID: 32810236, 32636376), suggesting that G4s and Rloops could co-localize at the same molecule. Dhx9 is a versatile helicase capable of directly resolving R-loops and G4s or promoting R-loop formation (PMID: 21561811, 30341290, 29742442, 32541651, 35905379, 34316718). Although depletion of Dhx9 resulted in 6,171 Dhx9-bound co-localized G4s and R-loops with significantly altered levels of G4s or R-loops, only 276 of them (~4.5%) harbored altered G4s and R-loops, suggesting that the interacting G4s and R-loops are rare in living cells. Nowadays, the genome-wide co-occurrence of two factors are mainly obtained by bioinformatically intersection analysis. We agreed that the heterogenous distribution between cells will give false positive co-occurrence patterns. We will carefully discuss this point in the revised version. At the same time, we will make efforts to develop a new method to map the co-localized G4 and R-loop in the same molecule in the future study.</p>

<p>In this study, we used the recombinant streptavidin monomer and anti-GP41 nanobody fusion protein (mSA-scFv) to specifically recognize hemin-G4-induced biotinylated G4 and then recruit the recombinant GP41-tagged Tn5 protein to these G4s sites. Similarly, the recombinant V5-tagged N-terminal hybrid-binding domain (HBD) of RNase H1 specifically recognizes R-loops and recruit the recombinant protein G-Tn5 (pG-Tn5) with the help of anti-V5 antibody. Therefore, the spatial distance of Tn5 to the target sites is well controlled and very short, and also the recruitment of Tn5 is specifically determined by the existence of G4s in HepG4-seq and R-loops in HBD-seq.</p>

<p>Thank you for the updating information about the structure data of S9.6 antibody. We politely disagree the specificity of the S9.6 antibody on RNA:DNA hybrids. The structural studies of S9.6 (PMID: 35347133, 35550870) used only one RNA:DNA hybrid to show the superior specificity of S9.6 on RNA:DNA hybrid than dsRNA and dsDNA. However, Fabian K. et al has reported that the binding affinities of S9.6 on RNA:DNA hybrid exhibits obvious sequence-dependent bias from null to nanomolar range (PMID: 28594954). We will include the comparison between S9.6-derived data and our HBD-seq data in the revised version.</p>

<p>Although HepG4-seq is an effective G4s detection technique, and the authors have also verified its reliability to some extent, given the strong link between ROS homeostasis and G4s formation, and hemin's affinity for different types of G4s, whether HepG4-seq reflects the dynamics of G4s in vivo more accurately than existing detection techniques still needs to be more carefully corroborated.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for pointing out this issue. In the <italic>in vitro</italic> hemin-G4 induced self-biotinylation assay, parallel G4s exhibit higher peroxidase activities than anti-parallel G4s. Thus, the dynamics of G4 conformation could affect the HepG4-seq signals (PMID: 32329781). In the future, people may need to combine HepG4-seq and BG4s-eq to carefully explain the endogenous G4s. We will carefully discuss this point in the revised version.</p>
