<title>Abstract</title><p>The Flower protein is proposed to couple synaptic vesicle fusion to recycling in different model organisms. It is supposed to trigger activity-dependent bulk endocytosis by conducting Ca<sup>2+</sup> at endocytic sites. However, this mode of action is debated. Here, we investigate the role of the nematode homolog (FLWR-1) in neurotransmission in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>. Our results confirm that FLWR-1 facilitates the recycling of synaptic vesicles at the neuromuscular junction. Ultrastructural analysis of synaptic boutons after hyperstimulation surprisingly reveals an accumulation of endosomal structures in <italic>flwr-1</italic> mutants. These findings do not support a role of FLWR-1 in the formation of bulk endosomes but rather a function in their breakdown following cleavage from the plasma membrane. Unexpectedly, loss of FLWR-1 conveys increased neuronal excitability which causes an excitation-inhibition imbalance. Finally, we obtained evidence that this increased transmission at the neuromuscular junction might be caused by deregulation of MCA-3, the nematode homolog of the plasma membrane Ca<sup>2+</sup> ATPase (PMCA).</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Chemical synaptic transmission involves a cycle of biogenesis of synaptic vesicles (SVs), their fusion with the plasma membrane (PM), as well as their recycling by endocytosis and de novo formation in the endosome. Coupling of SV exocytosis and endocytosis must be tightly controlled to avoid depletion of the reserve pool of SVs and to enable sustained neurotransmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Haucke et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Lou, 2018</xref>). Different hypotheses have been formulated as to how this is achieved within neurons. One hypothesis suggests that an SV-integral transmembrane protein called Flower could form ion channels and gets inserted into the PM during SV fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c102">Yao et al., 2009</xref>). Subsequently, it may facilitate endocytosis by conducting Ca<sup>2+</sup> into the cytoplasm, thus contributing to defining endocytic sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c103">Yao et al., 2017</xref>). In <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, Flower was proposed to increase phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>) levels through Ca<sup>2+</sup> microdomains, which was suggested to drive activity-dependent bulk endocytosis (ADBE) and formation of new SVs after prolonged, intense neurotransmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Li et al., 2020</xref>). The hypothesis that Flower may have Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel activity was further proposed based on sequence similarities between Flower and the Ca<sup>2+</sup> selectivity filter of voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels (VGCCs; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c102">Yao et al. (2009)</xref>). Additional evidence from <italic>Drosophila</italic> suggests that Flower may regulate clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) in a Ca<sup>2+</sup> independent fashion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c103">Yao et al., 2017</xref>). However, while a facilitatory role of Flower in endocytosis appears to be evolutionarily conserved, and was observed in different organisms and tissues, including non-neuronal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c103">Yao et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Chang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Rudd et al., 2023</xref>), its Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel activity and its influence on SV recycling is debated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Lou, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Coelho and Moreno, 2020</xref>). The kinetics of Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx mediated by Flower appear to be too slow and the amount conducted too low to have a major impact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c100">Xue et al., 2012</xref>). The function of Flower and its dependence on Ca<sup>2+</sup> moreover seem to be highly dependent on the cell type and the extent of synaptic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c103">Yao et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Chang et al., 2018</xref>). Apart from its role in endocytosis, Flower is involved in cell survival mechanisms during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Coelho and Moreno, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Costa-Rodrigues et al., 2021</xref>). Intriguingly, loss of the mammalian homolog of Flower can reduce tumor growth, suggesting an important function in tumor cell survival and introducing possible options for cancer treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Petrova et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Madan et al., 2019</xref>). However, sufficient research of the exact signaling pathways by means of which Flower mediates cell survival is lacking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Costa-Rodrigues et al., 2021</xref>).</p>
<p>Studies which address this mechanism usually propose a two- or three-transmembrane domain organization of the Flower protein structure in which the C-terminus is exposed to the extracellular space and can thus be used for intercellular communication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Rhiner et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Costa-Rodrigues et al., 2021</xref>). However, more recent research has shown that both N- and C-terminal tails of Flower are likely cytosolic and the longest mammalian isoforms consists of four transmembrane helices which are connected by short loops (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Chang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Rudd et al., 2023</xref>). The genome of nematodes is predicted to contain only a single isoform of Flower (FLWR-1; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://wormbase.org">wormbase.org</ext-link>). They therefore serve as excellent model organisms to further investigate the evolutionarily conserved role of Flower in neurotransmission and endocytosis. Here, we studied the function of FLWR-1 in the nematode <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>. We find that FLWR-1 localizes to SVs and to the PM and is involved in neurotransmission. We further show that FLWR-1 has a facilitatory but not essential role in endocytosis, confirming previous research in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and mammalian cells. Loss of FLWR-1 surprisingly conveys increased excitability of motor neurons and neurotransmitter release suggesting a deregulation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling in the presynapse. This is associated with defective SV recycling at the level of the endosome and thus reduced SV numbers upon sustained stimulation. This excitability change is more pronounced in γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic neurons and leads to an excitation-inhibition (E/I) imbalance at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) through increased release of the neurotransmitter GABA. A function of FLWR-1 in endocytosis appears to affect also the plasma membrane Ca<sup>2+</sup>-ATPase MCA-3, required for extrusion of Ca<sup>2+</sup> from the cytosol, and may thus explain the increased excitability observed in <italic>flwr-1</italic> mutant neurons.</p>

<title>Cultivation of <italic>C. elegans</italic></title>
<p>Animals were kept at 20 °C on nematode growth medium (NGM) plates seeded with OP50-1 bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Brenner, 1974</xref>). For optogenetic experiments, OP50-1 was supplemented with 200 µM ATR prior to seeding and animals were kept in darkness. Transgenic animals carrying extrachromosomal arrays were generated by microinjection into the gonads (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Fire, 1986</xref>). L4 staged larvae were picked ∼18 h before experiments and tested on at least three separate days with animals picked from different populations. Transgenic animals were selected by fluorescent markers using a Leica MZ16F dissection stereo microscope. Integration of the <italic>sybIs8965</italic> transgenic array (PHX8965 strain) was performed by SunyBiotech. The RB2305 strain containing the <italic>flwr-1(ok3128)</italic> allele was outcrossed three times with N2 wild type animals. An overview of strains with their respective genotypes and transgenes can be found in Supplementary Table 2.</p>

<sec id="s2c">
<title>Counting live progeny</title>
<p>To count living progeny per animal, five L4 larvae were singled onto NGM plates seeded with 50 µl OP50-1. Animals were then picked onto fresh plates after two days and on each of the following two days and removed on day five. Living progeny per animal was counted after reaching adulthood and summed up over the three plates each animal laid eggs on, respectively. Experiments were performed blinded to the genotype.</p>

<sec id="s2d">
<title>Pharmacological assays</title>
<p>1.5 mM aldicarb and 0.25 levamisole plates were prepared by adding the compounds to liquid NGM prior to plate pouring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Mahoney et al., 2006</xref>). Aldicarb (Sigma Aldrich, USA) was kept as a 100 mM stock solution in 70 % ethanol. Levamisole (Sigma Aldrich, USA) was stored as a 200 mM solution dissolved in ddH<sub>2</sub>O. 15 - 20 young adult animals were transferred to each plate and tested every 15 (levamisole) or 30 (aldicarb) minutes. Assays were performed blinded to the genotype and control groups (wild type and <italic>flwr-1</italic> mutants) were measured in parallel on the same day. Animals that did not respond after being prodded three times with a hair pick were counted as paralyzed. Worms that crawled of the plate were disregarded from analysis.</p>

<title>Measurement of swimming speed using the multi-worm-tracker (MWT)</title>
<p>Swimming speed was measured as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">Vettkotter et al., 2022</xref>). In short, worms were washed three times with M9 buffer to remove OP50 and transferred onto 3.5 cm NGM plates with 800 µl M9. Animals were visualized using the multiworm tracker (MWT) platform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">Swierczek et al., 2011</xref>) equipped with a Falcon 4M30 camera (DALSA). Channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) was stimulated with 470 nm light at 1 mW/mm<sup>2</sup> intensity for 90 s. 30 s videos were captured and thrashing was analyzed using the “wrmTrck” plugin for ImageJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Nussbaum-Krammer et al., 2015</xref>). The automatically generated tracks were validated using a custom written Python script (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/dvettkoe/SwimmingTracksProcessing">https://github.com/dvettkoe/SwimmingTracksProcessing</ext-link>).</p>

<title>Measurement of body length</title>
<p>Body length was measured as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Liewald et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">Seidenthal et al., 2022</xref>). In short, single animals were transferred onto unseeded NGM plates and illuminated with light from a 50 W HBO lamp which was filtered with a 450 - 490 nm bandpass excitation filter. ChR2 was stimulated with 100 µW/mm<sup>2</sup> light intensity. A 665 - 715 nm filter was used to avoid unwanted activation by brightfield light. Body length was analyzed using the “WormRuler” software (version 1.3.0) and normalized for the average skeleton length before stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">Seidenthal et al., 2022</xref>). Values which are more than 20 % higher or lower than the initial body length were discarded as they result from artifacts in the background correction and are biomechanically unlikely. Basal body length was calculated from the skeleton length in pixels which is generated by the WormRuler software. This was converted to mm and averaged for each animal over a duration of five seconds.</p>

<title>Light microscopy and quantification of fluorescence</title>
<p>Animals were placed upon 7 % agarose pads in M9 buffer. Worms were immobilized by either using 20 mM levamisole in M9 or Polybead polystyrene microspheres (Polysciences) for experiments involving GABAergic stimulation. For optogenetic experiments, single animals were placed upon pads to avoid unwanted pre-activation of channelrhodopsins. Imaging was performed using a Axio Observer Z1 microscope (Zeiss, Germany). Proteins were excited using 460 nm and 590 nm LEDs (Lumen 100, Prior Scientific, UK) coupled via a beamsplitter. Background correction was conducted by placing a region of interest (ROI) within the animal yet avoiding autofluorescence.</p>
<p>GCaMP and pHluorin imaging and ChrimsonSA stimulation was performed using a 605 nm beamsplitter (AHF Analysentechnik, Germany) which was combined with a double band pass filter (460 - 500 and 570 - 600 nm). A single bandpass emission filter was used (502.5 - 537.5 nm). pOpsicle assays were performed as described previously using a 100-x objective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">Seidenthal et al., 2023</xref>). We extended the ChrimsonSA stimulation light pulse to 30 s to be consistent with the stimulus length of electron microscopy (EM) and electrophysiology experiments. Moreover, 2 x 2 binning was applied. Image sequences with 200 ms light exposure (5 frames per second) were acquired with an sCMOS camera (Kinetix 22, Teledyne Photometrics, USA). Video acquisition was controlled using the µManager v.1.4.22 software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Edelstein et al., 2014</xref>). The timing of LED activation was managed using a <italic>Autohotkey</italic> script. GCaMP imaging was conducted similarly with the same setup and light intensity for ChrimsonSA stimulation (40 µW/mm<sup>2</sup>) yet without binning. Dorsal nerve cord (DNC) fluorescence was quantified with ImageJ by placing a region of interest ROI with the <italic>Segmented Line</italic> tool. XY-drift was corrected using the <italic>Template Matching</italic> plugin if necessary. Animals showing excessive z-drift were discarded. A custom written python script was used to summarize background subtraction and normalization to the average fluorescence before pulse start (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/MariusSeidenthal/pHluorin_Imaging_Analysis">https://github.com/MariusSeidenthal/pHluorin_Imaging_Analysis</ext-link>). For GCaMP imaging, the bleach correction function of this python script was used which corrects fluorescence traces with strong bleaching. Strong bleaching is defined as the fluorescence intensity of the mean of the last second of measurement being less than 85% of the first second. The script performs linear regression analysis for DNC fluorescent traces and background ROI and corrects values prior to background correction. The increase in GCaMP fluorescence during stimulation was highly dependent on basal fluorescence values before stimulation and transient Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals. This caused some measurements to show very strong increases in fluorescence. To avoid distortion of statistical analyses, we performed outlier detection for the increase during stimulation on all datasets with the Graphpad Prism 9.4.1 Iterative Grubb’s method. The alpha value (false discovery rate) was set to 0.01. For pOpsicle assays, animals were screened for whether they show a significant increase in fluorescence during stimulation, which is necessary for analysis of fluorescence decay after stimulation. A strong signal was determined as the maximum background corrected fluorescence during the light pulse (moving average of 5 frames) being larger than the average before stimulation + 3 times the standard deviation of the background corrected fluorescence before stimulation. Regression analysis of pHluorin fluorescence decay was performed as described previously by using Graphpad Prism 9.4.1 and fitting a “Plateau followed one-phase exponential decay” fit beginning with the first time point after stimulation to single measurements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">Seidenthal et al., 2023</xref>). Animals that displayed no increase during stimulation as well as animals showing no decay or spontaneous signals after stimulation were discarded from analysis.</p>
<p>Comparison of dorsal and ventral (VNC) nerve cord fluorescence of GFP::FLWR-1 and mCherry::SNB-1 was conducted by imaging the posterior part of the animal where an abundance of synapses can be found. Images were acquired using the same beamsplitter and excitation filter as used for pOpsicle experiments but equipped with a 500 – 540 nm/600 – 665 nm double bandpass emission filter (AHF Analysentechnik, Germany) and 2 x 2 binning. The Arduino script “AOTFcontroller” was used to control synchronized 2-color illumination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Aoki et al., 2023</xref>). VNC and DNC fluorescence were analyzed by choosing single frames from acquired z-stacks in which nerve cords were well focused. Fluorescence intensities were quantified by placing a <italic>Segmented Line</italic> ROI. Kymographs were generated with the ImageJ <italic>Multi Kymograph</italic> function.</p>
<p>Confocal laser scanning microscopy was performed on a LSM 780 microscope (Zeiss, Germany) equipped with a Plan-Apochromat 63-x oil objective. The Zeiss Zen (blue edition) <italic>Tile Scan</italic> and <italic>Z-Stack</italic> functions were used to generate overview images of animals expressing GFP::FLWR-1. Images were processed and maximum z-projection performed using ImageJ. Colocalization analysis was performed by placing a <italic>Segmented Line</italic> ROI onto the DNC and plotting the fluorescence profile along the selected ROI for both color channels. Correlation of fluorescence intensities was then conducted using the GraphPad Prism 9.4.1 Pearson correlation function.</p>
<p>Fluorescence of GFP taken up by coelomocytes was visualized with a 40-x objective. An eGFP filter cube (AHF Analysentechnik, Germany) was used and fluorescence was excited with the 460 nm LED. Images were acquired using 50 ms exposure and 2 x 2 binning. Fluorescence was quantified by drawing a ROI around all coelomocytes found within any worm imaged using the <italic>Freehand selections</italic> tool and performing background correction. Coelomocyte fluorescence was then averaged for each animal.</p>

<title>Electrophysiology</title>
<p>Electrophysiological recordings of body wall muscle cells (BWMs) were done in dissected adult worms as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Liewald et al., 2008</xref>). Animals were immobilized with Histoacryl L glue (B. Braun Surgical, Spain) and a lateral incision was made to access NMJs along the anterior VNC. The basement membrane overlying BWMs was enzymatically removed by 0.5 mg/ml collagenase for 10 s (C5138, Sigma-Aldrich, Germany). Integrity of BWMs and nerve cord was visually examined via DIC microscopy.</p>
<p>Recordings from BWMs were acquired in whole-cell patch-clamp mode at 20-22 °C using an EPC-10 amplifier equipped with Patchmaster software (HEKA, Germany). The head stage was connected to a standard HEKA pipette holder for fire-polished borosilicate pipettes (1B100F-4, Worcester Polytechnic Institute, USA) of 4–10 MΩ resistance. The extracellular bath solution consisted of 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 5 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>,1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>,10 mM glucose, 5 mM sucrose, and 15 mM HEPES, pH 7.3, with NaOH, ∼330 mOsm. The internal/patch pipette solution consisted of K-gluconate 115 mM, KCl 25 mM, CaCl<sub>2</sub> 0.1 mM, MgCl<sub>2</sub> 5 mM, BAPTA 1 mM, HEPES 10 mM, Na<sub>2</sub>ATP 5 mM, Na<sub>2</sub>GTP 0.5 mM, cAMP 0.5 mM, and cGMP 0.5 mM, pH 7.2, with KOH, ∼320 mOsm.</p>
<p>Voltage clamp experiments were conducted at a holding potential of −60 mV. Light activation was performed using an LED lamp (KSL-70, Rapp OptoElectronic, Hamburg, Germany; 470 nm, 8 mW/mm²) and controlled by the Patchmaster software. Subsequent analysis was performed using Patchmaster and Origin (Originlabs). Analysis of mPSCs was conducted with MiniAnalysis (Synaptosoft, Decatur, GA, USA, version 6.0.7) and rate and amplitude of mPSCs was analyzed in 1 s bins. Exponential decay of mPSCs during stimulation was calculated with Graphpad Prism 9.4.1 by fitting a one-phase exponential decay beginning with the first time point during stimulation.</p>

<p>Prior to high-pressure freezing (HPF), L4 animals were transferred to freshly seeded <italic>E. coli</italic> OP50-1 dishes supplemented with or without 0.1 mM ATR. HPF fixation was performed on young adult animals as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c95">Weimer, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Kittelmann et al., 2013b</xref>). Briefly, 20 - 40 animals were transferred into a 100 µm deep aluminum planchette (Microscopy Services) filled with <italic>E. coli</italic> (supplemented with or without ATR, respectively), covered with a sapphire disk (0.16 mm) and a spacer ring (0.4 mm; engineering office M.

Animals were continuously illuminated for 30 s with a laser (470 nm, ∼20 mW/mm²) followed by HPF at −180 °C under 2100 bar pressure in an HPM100 (Leica Microsystems). Frozen specimens were transferred under liquid nitrogen into a Reichert AFS machine (Leica Microsystems) for freeze substitution. Samples were incubated with tannic acid (0.1% in dry acetone) fixative at −90 °C for 100 h. Afterward, a process of washing was performed for substitution with acetone, followed by incubation of the samples in 2% OsO<sub>4</sub> (in dry acetone) for 39.5 h while the temperature was slowly increased up to room temperature. Subsequently, samples were embedded in epoxy resin (Agar Scientific, AGAR 100 Premix kit – hard) by increasing epoxy resin concentrations from 50% to 90% at room temperature and 100% at 60 °C for 48 h. Electron micrographs of 2 - 5individual animals, and from 12 – 22 synapses per treatment, were acquired by cutting cross sections at a thickness of 40 nm, transferring cross sections to formvar- or pioloform covered copper slot grids. Specimens were counterstained in 2.5% aqueous uranyl acetate for 4 min, followed by washing with distilled water, and incubation in Reynolds lead citrate solution for 2 min in a CO<sub>2</sub>-free chamber with subsequent washing steps in distilled water. VNC regions were then imaged with a Zeiss 900 TEM, operated at 80 kV, with a Troendle 2K camera. Images were scored and tagged blind in ImageJ (version 1.53c, National Institute of Health) as described previously, and analyzed using SynapsEM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c92">Watanabe et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">Vettkotter et al., 2022</xref>).

<title>FLWR-1 is involved in neurotransmission</title>
<p>The amino acid sequence of <italic>C. elegans</italic> FLWR-1 is conserved to its <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> (Fwe-Ubi) and <italic>Homo sapiens</italic> (hFwe4) homologues (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). Fwe-Ubi has been shown to facilitate recovery of neurons following intense synaptic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c102">Yao et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c103">Yao et al., 2017</xref>). To investigate whether this involvement of Flower in neurotransmission is evolutionarily conserved, we studied a mutant lacking most of the <italic>flwr-1</italic> coding region (<italic>ok3128</italic>, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Consortium, 2012</xref>). Animals lacking FLWR-1 did not display severe phenotypic differences to wild type animals. Basal locomotion in liquid (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C, D</xref> seconds 0 – 30) and body length of young adults (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1A</xref>) were not significantly different from the respective values of wild type animals. However, fertility appeared slightly reduced (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1B</xref>). Thus, it is likely that FLWR-1 does not have an essential function in neurotransmission but rather a regulatory or facilitatory role. Previous studies have shown that mutations which only weakly affect basal locomotion, can display severely reduced recovery of swimming speed after strong optogenetic stimulation of cholinergic neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c104">Yu et al., 2018</xref>). We therefore subjected <italic>flwr-1(ok3128)</italic> mutants expressing channelrhodopsin-2(H134R), which were treated with the chromophore all-<italic>trans</italic> retinal (ATR), to blue light during swimming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Nagel et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Liewald et al., 2008</xref>). Photostimulation resulted in a stop of all swimming during the light pulse, followed by a slow recovery in the dark. Indeed, loss of FLWR-1 led to a significantly slowed recovery of swimming locomotion (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C, D</xref>). This could be fully rescued by transgenic expression of genomic FLWR-1 including a two kilobase sequence upstream of the putative start codon, hereafter called <italic>pflwr-1</italic> (as the promoter of <italic>flwr-1</italic>). To further evaluate the involvement of FLWR-1 in neurotransmission, we exposed <italic>flwr-1</italic> mutants to aldicarb. This acetylcholine esterase inhibitor induces paralysis due to accumulation of acetylcholine in the synaptic cleft (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Mahoney et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Blazie and Jin, 2018</xref>). Resistance to aldicarb indicates either reduced release or reception of acetylcholine or increased inhibitory signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">Vashlishan et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Janosi et al., 2024</xref>). Loss of FLWR-1 led to a significant delay in paralysis indicating involvement in transmission at the NMJ (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>). Full rescue of the <italic>flwr-1</italic> mutant phenotypes suggests that expression from the 2 kB fragment of the endogenous promoter fully recapitulates the native expression in the context of NMJ function.</p>

<title>FLWR-1 is expressed in excitable cells and localizes to synaptic vesicles</title>
<p>Invertebrate and vertebrate homologues of FLWR-1 are predicted to be membrane proteins containing four transmembrane helices with both C- and N-termini located in the cytosol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c102">Yao et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Chang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Rudd et al., 2023</xref>). <italic>In silico</italic> predictions using the FLWR-1 sequence of 166 amino acids suggest evolutionary conservation of the tetraspan structure (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Hallgren et al., 2022</xref>). Accordingly, Alphafold3 prediction of FLWR-1 protein structure implies a four helical configuration, with helix lengths that could span biological membranes, and three additional, shorter α-helices (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Abramson et al., 2024</xref>). We sought to determine the cellular as well as subcellular localizations of FLWR-1 by tagging its C-terminus with GFP and expressing the construct using the endogenous promoter (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A – C</xref>). Green fluorescence could be observed in developing embryos in the uterus, as well as in various tissues including neurons, body wall and pharyngeal muscles (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). FLWR-1 localized to neurites and cell bodies of nerve ring neurons, representing the central nervous system (brain) of the nematode (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">Ward et al., 1975</xref>). These results are in accordance with single-cell RNA-sequencing data obtained from <italic>C. elegans</italic> which show near ubiquitous expression of <italic>flwr-1/F20D1.1</italic> (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2C</xref>, Supplementary Table 3; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">Taylor et al.

As its <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> homolog was localized to synaptic vesicles (SVs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c102">Yao et al., 2009</xref>), we wondered whether FLWR-1 would colocalize with known SV markers such as synaptobrevin-1 (SNB-1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Nonet, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Calahorro and Izquierdo, 2018</xref>). Indeed, GFP::FLWR-1 fluorescence largely overlapped with co-expressed mCherry::SNB-1 in the dorsal nerve cord (DNC; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D, E</xref>). FLWR-1 further seemed to be enriched in fluorescent puncta in DNC and sublateral nerve cords indicating synaptic localization (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D - F</xref>), however it was not restricted to synaptic regions only, meaning it is likely present also in the PM.</p>

<p>Furthermore, we observed moving particles, probably SV precursors, which contain SNB-1 and FLWR-1, travelling along commissures between ventral nerve cord (VNC) and DNC (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2F, G</xref> and Supplementary Movie 1). Anterograde transport of these precursors towards synapses has been shown to be dependent on kinesin-3/UNC-104 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Hall and Hedgecock, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Klopfenstein and Vale, 2004</xref>). We used a strong reduction-of-function allele (<italic>e1265</italic>) affecting interaction of UNC-104 with its cargo to investigate whether FLWR-1 is actively transported towards synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Cong et al., 2021</xref>). Indeed, animals lacking functional UNC-104 showed a reduced amount of axonal GFP fluorescence in the nerve ring and DNC while cell bodies were clearly visible (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2D</xref>). The ratio of DNC to VNC fluorescence is significantly decreased in <italic>unc-104</italic> mutants suggesting defective anterograde transport (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2H</xref>).

<title>GABAergic signaling is increased in <italic>flwr-1</italic> knockout mutants</title>
<p>Since FLWR-1 is also expressed in body wall muscles (BWMs), we wondered whether the observed aldicarb resistance originates from reduced acetylcholine reception by acetylcholine receptors (AChR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Mahoney et al., 2006</xref>). To test this, we exposed animals lacking FLWR-1 to levamisole, an AChR agonist which induces paralysis by hypercontraction, similar to aldicarb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Sattelle et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Gottschalk et al., 2005</xref>). We found no significant differences in the rate of paralysis between wild type and mutant animals (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3A</xref>). However, transgenic expression of FLWR-1 in BWMs did rescue the aldicarb resistance partially (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3B</xref>). Therefore, loss of FLWR-1 seems to decrease excitability of muscle cells in an aldicarb dependent context which may contribute to the aldicarb resistance of <italic>flwr-1</italic> mutants.</p>
<p>Yet, we also observed enrichment of FLWR-1 in fluorescent puncta indicating presynaptic localization (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A, B</xref>). Moreover, FLWR-1 partially colocalized with the dense projection marker ELKS-1 in cholinergic as well as in GABAergic neurons (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A, B</xref>; <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3C-E</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Dai et al. (2006)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Kittelmann et al. (2013a)</xref>). Unlike ELKS-1, FLWR-1 could also be found to a lesser extent in intersynaptic regions. This indicates that FLWR-1 might be involved in neurotransmission at both cholinergic and GABAergic NMJs yet is not exclusively localized to active zones. To determine whether the site of action of FLWR-1 in NMJ signaling is evenly located to cholinergic and GABAergic neurons, we rescued FLWR-1 in each subset of these neurons. To achieve the intended expression, the promoters of the vesicular transporters of acetylcholine (UNC-17) and GABA (UNC-47) were inserted in front of the FLWR-1 genomic sequence. Surprisingly, expression of FLWR-1 in GABAergic, but not in cholinergic, neurons rescued aldicarb resistance (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>). This was unexpected since mutations affecting SV recycling commonly lead to a slowed replenishment of SVs and thus reduced acetylcholine release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Salcini et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">Schuske et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c104">Yu et al., 2018</xref>). However, our results indicate that loss of FLWR-1 leads to increased release of GABA which counteracts the aldicarb induced paralysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Camara et al., 2019</xref>). To confirm this, we crossed <italic>flwr-1</italic> mutants into animals which lack the vesicular GABA transporter UNC-47. This abolishes GABA release and induces hypersensitivity to aldicarb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">Vashlishan et al., 2008</xref>). We observed that the additional mutation of <italic>unc-47</italic> led to a complete loss of aldicarb resistance in <italic>flwr-1</italic> mutants (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>). This supports the notion that increased GABA signaling, not decreased acetylcholine release, is the main cause of aldicarb resistance in <italic>flwr</italic>-1 animals.</p>

<title>Neuronal excitability is increased in <italic>flwr-1</italic> mutants</title>
<p>Since the release of GABA appeared to be increased in <italic>flwr-1</italic> mutant animals, we wondered whether the excitability of GABAergic neurons is increased. To test this, the fluorescent Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator GCaMP was expressed in GABAergic neurons, allowing us to estimate relative Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels at presynaptic sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Nakai et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Lu et al., 2022</xref>). We co-expressed the red-shifted ChrimsonSA channelrhodopsin variant to control depolarization of neurons, independent of GCaMP excitation light (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Oda et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">Seidenthal et al., 2022</xref>). As expected, optogenetic stimulation caused an increase in GCaMP fluorescence at NMJs in the DNC (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>). Comparing wild type and <italic>flwr-1</italic> mutants, we found that the gain in fluorescence intensity was significantly higher in animals lacking FLWR-1 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A, B</xref>), supporting our previous finding of increased neurotransmission in GABAergic neurons. To verify this at the behavioral level, we used a strain expressing ChR2(H134R) in GABAergic neurons, as it can be used to assess GABA release through measurement of body length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Liewald et al., 2008</xref>). Since GABA receptors hyperpolarize muscle cells, optogenetic stimulation of GABAergic motor neurons causes relaxation and thus increased body length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Schultheis et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">Seidenthal et al., 2022</xref>). To augment the effect of ChR2 stimulation on body length and to observe the effect of GABA release independent of cholinergic neurotransmission, the assay was performed in a mutant background lacking a functional subunit of the levamisole receptor (<italic>unc-29</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Fleming et al. (1997)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Richmond and Jorgensen (1999)</xref>). As expected, stimulation with blue light led to increased body length (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>). In accordance with Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging results, <italic>flwr-1; unc-29</italic> double mutants showed a significantly stronger elongation during stimulation compared to the <italic>unc-29</italic> single mutant (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C, D</xref>). These results indicate that Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx into the synapse is increased, likely causing more GABA to be released in animals lacking FLWR-1. The previously observed aldicarb resistance indicates that this change in GABAergic transmission outweighs possible changes in cholinergic transmission (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). To investigate whether neuronal excitability may be generally upregulated in <italic>flwr-1</italic> mutants, we assessed whether Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx is affected in cholinergic motor neurons as well (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E, F</xref>). Again, we observed increased GCaMP fluorescence levels during optogenetic stimulation. Together, these results indicate that loss of FLWR-1 conveys an upregulation of neuronal excitability during continuous stimulation in both classes of motor neurons (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4G</xref>). However, the overall E/I balance appears to be shifted towards stronger inhibition of BWMs.</p>

<title>Endocytosis is slowed in <italic>flwr-1</italic> mutants in non-neuronal cells and neurons</title>
<p>Homologues of FLWR-1 were found to be involved in endocytosis in neuronal as well as non-neuronal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c102">Yao et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Chang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Rudd et al., 2023</xref>). We thus wondered whether this function is evolutionarily conserved in nematodes. One possibility to assess this in <italic>C. elegans</italic> is to observe the efficiency of endocytosis by coelomocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Fares and Greenwald, 2001</xref>). These scavenger cells continuously endocytose fluid from the body cavity and loss of endocytosis-associated factors leads to a defective uptake of proteins secreted from other tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Fares and Grant, 2002</xref>). By expressing GFP fused to a secretory signal sequence which is discharged from BWMs, endocytic uptake by coelomocytes can be quantified by fluorescence microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Fares and Greenwald, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bednarek et al., 2007</xref>). According to single-cell RNAseq data, FLWR-1 is expressed in coelomocytes (Supplementary Table 3; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">Taylor et al. (2021)</xref>). Indeed, mutation of <italic>flwr-1</italic> led to strongly reduced GFP fluorescence levels within coelomocytes indicating a reduced uptake by endocytosis (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A, B</xref>).</p>

<p>We further used the recently established pOpsicle (pH-sensitive optogenetic reporter of synaptic vesicle recycling) assay to estimate the amount of SV fusion and the rate of recycling of SV components in cholinergic neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">Seidenthal et al., 2023</xref>). This assay combines a pHluorin based probe fused to an SV-associated protein (SNG-1) and optogenetic stimulation of neurotransmitter release; this way, pHluorin fluorescence is unquenched during stimulated exocytosis and quenched during SV endocytosis and recycling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Sankaranarayanan et al., 2000</xref>). Loss of FLWR-1 led to significantly increased fluorescence signals during stimulation which indicates more SV fusion compared to wild type (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C, E</xref>). This is in accordance with the increased excitability of cholinergic neurons we observed earlier (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E, F</xref>). Moreover, the rate of fluorescence decay after stimulation was significantly delayed in <italic>flwr-1</italic> mutants suggesting slower recycling of SVs, or reduced acidification of endosomal structures or SVs after recycling (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D, F</xref>).</p>
<p>Slowed replenishment of SV pools caused by defective recycling is known to cause synaptic depression, as assessed by electrophysiological measurements of post-synaptic currents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c97">Wu and Betz, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Kittelmann et al., 2013b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Krick et al., 2021</xref>). This is also the case in <italic>Drosophila</italic> for animals lacking Flower (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c102">Yao et al., 2009</xref>). To address this in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, we measured miniature post-synaptic currents (mPSCs) in BWMs, which reflect the post-synaptic effects of presynaptic neurotransmitter release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Liewald et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c96">Weissenberger et al., 2011</xref>). Animals lacking FLWR-1 showed no significant difference in unstimulated mPSC frequency or amplitude (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Fig. S4A, B</xref>) which is in accordance with FLWR-1 being dispensable in basal swimming locomotion (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C, D</xref>). Similarly, pulsed optogenetic stimulation of cholinergic neurons at different frequencies did not reveal a difference in the measured currents between wild type and mutants (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Fig. S4C, D</xref>) suggesting that FLWR-1 might be needed only during continuous stimulation. Indeed, <italic>flwr-1</italic> mutants showed an accelerated rundown of the mPSC frequency in BWMs during constant illumination (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5G, H</xref>). This is in accordance with a role of FLWR-1 in SV recycling. Surprisingly, mPSC amplitudes in <italic>flwr-1</italic> mutants are reduced during 30 s hyperstimulation (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5I, J</xref>). This suggests that either the amount of neurotransmitter released from a single SV or the number of multivesicular fusion events is decreased (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Liu et al., 2005</xref>). The absolute mPSC frequency, which represents the number of SVs fusing per time, was also smaller during continuous stimulation in <italic>flwr-1</italic> animals (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Fig. S4E, F, G</xref>). These results contrast the increased excitability of cholinergic neurons we observed (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A, E</xref>). Since cholinergic neurons also stimulate GABAergic neurons, and since GABAergic minis are also evaluated here, the dissection of animals, required for electrophysiological recordings, could damage neuronal commissures, causing an interruption of physiological signal transmission, which is otherwise observed in intact animals. We further analyzed whether <italic>flwr-1</italic> mutants can recover from strong optogenetic 30 s stimulation by applying a short stimulus after a recovery period (inter stimulus interval, ISI) of 15 s, and found no significant difference to wildtype (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Fig. S4E, H</xref>). This suggests that a 15 s ISI is sufficient for <italic>flwr-1</italic> mutants to recover to the same extent as wild type synapses. In sum, our results support a facilitatory role of FLWR-1 in SV recycling specifically during continuous stimulation.</p>

<title>Loss of FLWR-1 leads to depleted SV pools and accumulation of endosomal structures after optogenetic stimulation</title>
<p>Mutations which affect endocytosis commonly have fewer SVs because of defective recovery of SV components which could also be shown for Flower defective <italic>Drosophila</italic> boutons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">Schuske et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c102">Yao et al., 2009</xref>). Such a defect is even more pronounced when samples are conserved immediately following optogenetic stimulation by high-pressure freezing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Kittelmann et al., 2013b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c104">Yu et al., 2018</xref>). In nematodes, this optogenetic stimulation can be controlled by supplementing all-<italic>trans</italic> retinal (ATR), the chromophore of ChR2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Nagel et al., 2005</xref>). Ultrastructural analysis using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) indeed revealed fewer SVs in stimulated <italic>flwr-1</italic> mutant synapses compared to wild type (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A, B</xref>). This indicates that <italic>flwr-1</italic> mutants, unlike wild type, are unable to refill SV pools sufficiently fast. At the same time, loss of <italic>Drosophila</italic> Flower has been shown to cause defective formation of bulk endosomal structures after strong stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c103">Yao et al., 2017</xref>). In contrast to this, we observed an increased, rather than decreased, number of endosomes in stimulated <italic>flwr-1</italic> mutant synapses (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C</xref>). This may either be caused by increased SV fusion which triggers bulk endosomal formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Clayton et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c99">Wu et al., 2014</xref>) or defective breakdown of recycling endosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93">Watanabe et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Gan and Watanabe, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c104">Yu et al., 2018</xref>). Our pHluorin imaging data (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C - F</xref>), would support the notion that both, increased SV fusion as well as defective recovery and subsequent acidification of SVs, may cause the higher number of endosomes in <italic>flwr-1</italic> mutants. However, we note that our stimulation regime likely resembles a more physiological activation of neurotransmission compared to the intense stimuli previously used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c103">Yao et al., 2017</xref>), as wild type synapses only rarely contained endosomal structures. Moreover, we observed fewer docked vesicles in <italic>flwr-1</italic> animals which have been treated with ATR, compared to those without (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6D</xref>). This might be caused by increased SV fusion and is in line with the increased excitability we observed before. The number of large vesicles and neuropeptide-containing dense core vesicles (DCVs) is unchanged in animals lacking FLWR-1 (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Fig. S5</xref>).</p>

<title>The increased excitability of <italic>flwr-1</italic> neurons may be caused by deregulation of MCA-3</title>
<p>While a facilitatory role of Flower in endocytosis appears to be conserved in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, we found no evidence that FLWR-1 conducts Ca<sup>2+</sup> upon insertion into the PM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c102">Yao et al., 2009</xref>).

<p>Since full knockouts of <italic>mca-3</italic> are lethal, it is likely that this represents a reduction-of-function mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bednarek et al., 2007</xref>). As expected, <italic>mca-3</italic> mutants displayed increased Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx (or net Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels, representing the summed VGCC-mediated entry and MCA-3-mediated efflux) upon optogenetic stimulation of cholinergic motor neurons (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig"><bold>Fig</bold>. <bold>7B, C</bold></xref>). Elevated Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels appeared to be further enhanced by additionally mutating <italic>flwr-1</italic>, however this did not meet significance. This was likely due to the large variance in the measurements, which was due to some cells showing very low basal Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels (i.e. GCaMP fluorescence) yet reaching similarly high levels during stimulation. As is, our data suggest that the two genes are not in a common pathway, as the effects appear to be additive. However, the <italic>mca-3</italic> mutant used here is only a reduction-of-function mutant, thus additional deregulation by loss of FLWR-1 may explain the possible additive effect. A different picture was observed in aldicarb assays: Reduction of MCA-3 function conveyed aldicarb resistance that was, however, less pronounced than for <italic>flwr-1</italic> mutants (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7D</xref>). Here, the double mutant did not further augment the mutant phenotype of <italic>flwr-1</italic>, which may be interpreted as that both proteins function in the same pathway, where <italic>flwr-1</italic> is upstream of <italic>mca-3</italic>.</p>

This suggests that the respective glutamate may not be essential for FLWR-1 function but may have an impact on protein stability.

<p>FLWR-1, like MCA-3, has further been suggested to bind to phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>), an important regulator of SV recycling, and affect its levels within the PM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bednarek et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Lopreiato et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Li et al., 2020</xref>). Binding of transmembrane proteins (including TRP channels) to PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> is generally mediated by positively charged amino acid residues (lysine and arginine) close to the intracellular side of the PM, which bind to the negatively charged phosphate residues (<xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Fig. S7C</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Ribalet et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Hansen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Duncan et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Rohacs, 2024</xref>).

A positive charge at this position is evolutionarily conserved, suggesting an important function (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8C</xref>). Moreover, these amino acids have been suggested to mediate PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> binding in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> Flower (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Li et al., 2020</xref>). Expression of a mutated version of FLWR-1 in which both residues were replaced by alanines only partially rescued aldicarb resistance (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8D</xref>), implying that FLWR-1 function may be facilitated by these residues and their potential interaction with PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>.</p>
<p>These findings implicate that the conserved glutamate residue 74 is not essential, yet still important for FLWR-1 activity. In addition, an interaction with PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> <italic>via</italic> basic amino acids also seems to be an important factor. However, we do note that FLWR-1 structural models as depicted here rely on <italic>in silico</italic> predictions. The actual biological structure of FLWR-1, or its homologues, has yet to be determined using X-ray crystallography or cryo-EM.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Here, we found that loss of FLWR-1 conveyed increased excitability of motor neurons, particularly GABAergic neurons, thus leading to more GABA release. This gives rise to an E/I imbalance at the NMJ. We showed that FLWR-1 is localized to SVs in neuronal cells, and we found an accumulation of endosomal structures as well as slowed acidification kinetics in <italic>flwr-1</italic> mutant animals, suggesting defective recovery of SVs from recycling endosomes. We further found indications that deregulation of PMCAs may be the cause of the increased excitability of <italic>flwr-1</italic> neurons (see model, <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8E</xref>).</p>
<p>MCA-3 has previously been suggested to facilitate endocytosis in other cells, namely coelomocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bednarek et al., 2007</xref>). This indicates that both, increased excitability as well as defective endocytosis in coelomocytes, may be influenced by deregulation of MCA-3 in <italic>flwr-1</italic> mutants. Whether FLWR-1 directly activates expression or function of MCA-3, or whether this is caused by a homeostatic change because of the loss of FLWR-1, is yet unclear. However, it is important to note that <italic>Drosophila</italic> Flower was shown to increase neuronal PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> levels, which drives ADBE during sustained neurotransmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Li et al., 2020</xref>). We could show that an involvement with PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> is likely conserved in nematodes. Similarly, MCA-3 was important to maintain PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> in coelomocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bednarek et al., 2007</xref>). Thus, FLWR-1 and MCA-3 may have a shared role in the regulation of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> levels. The question thus arises, whether FLWR-1 acts upstream of MCA-3 or vice versa or whether they act in parallel. Our results indicate that MCA-3 may be functionally affected in <italic>flwr-1</italic> mutants explaining increased Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels during stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Brini and Carafoli, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Chamberland et al., 2019</xref>). Alternatively, MCA-3 may undergo endo-exocytosis and this could be affected by effects of the <italic>flwr-1</italic> mutation on endocytosis and recycling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Ono et al., 2019</xref>). The increased Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx we observed was at first surprising, since work in <italic>Drosophila</italic> has yielded opposite results during 40 Hz electrical stimulation in neuromuscular boutons of Flower mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c103">Yao et al., 2017</xref>). At stimulation with 10 Hz, however, these animals showed an increased GCaMP signal compared to wild type, in line with our observations. Potentially, increased excitability is only observed with lower, more physiological stimulation of neurons.</p>
<p>Even though we observed increased, instead of decreased, Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx into the pre-synapse in <italic>flwr-1</italic> mutants, we cannot conclude about the putative Ca<sup>2+</sup>-conducting activity of FLWR-1. However, it was discussed that the kinetics of Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx induced by Flower in <italic>Drosophila</italic> are too slow and the extent too little as to directly trigger known modes of endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Brose and Neher, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c100">Xue et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Leitz and Kavalali, 2016</xref>). Therefore, rather than having a function in directly coupling exo- and endocytosis, we suggest that FLWR-1 has a regulatory role in facilitating SV recycling, potentially by affecting MCA-3 activity. Increased Ca<sup>2+</sup> at endocytic sites could, for example, lead to activation of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor calmodulin which has been shown to promote endocytosis in nerve terminals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c98">Wu et al., 2009</xref>). However, whether the small and slow Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx observed for <italic>Drosophila</italic> Flower is sufficient to activate calmodulin is unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c98">Wu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c102">Yao et al., 2009</xref>). To assess the possibility of FLWR-1 forming an ion channel, we used artificial intelligence-based protein structure prediction. Assuming similarity to Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels, we asked AF3 to model FLWR-1 as a tetramer. The putative pore lining residues were mostly hydrophobic or apolar, thus not well in agreement with a function as an ion channel. The suggested similarity to the selectivity filter of VGCCs, including the sequence EGW or EAW (in FLWR-1 this is EAP; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c102">Yao et al. (2009)</xref>) was not confirmed in the AF3 models: While glutamate faces the extracellular end of the VGCC pore in all four channel modules, E74<sub>FLWR-1</sub> pointed away from the pore. We thus think that FLWR-1 is very unlikely to form an ion channel.</p>
<p>Should FLWR-1 exert an influence on PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> levels, this may activate PMCAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Berrocal et al., 2017</xref>), which would remove Ca<sup>2+</sup> and prevent sustained phospholipase C activity, thus protecting PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> at the PM from hydrolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Lopreiato et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Penniston et al., 2014</xref>). Increased PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> levels could then activate different forms of endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Posor et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Blumrich et al., 2023</xref>). Such interactions could further trigger a positive feedback loop leading to invagination of the PM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c103">Yao et al., 2017</xref>). Both, PMCAs and Flower, were suggested to directly bind PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> with positively charged amino acid residues in areas close to their respective transmembrane regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Filoteo et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Li et al., 2020</xref>). In line with this, the FLWR-1 AF3 model exhibits several amino acids in positions that could interact with PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> headgroups in the membrane, similar to the interaction of potassium channels with PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>. This could lead to a close arrangement of both proteins in PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> lipid microdomains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Katan and Cockcroft, 2020</xref>). Flower could also activate PMCAs in intracellular compartments after endocytosis. One PMCA variant was shown to be mainly localized to recycling SVs and endosomes and Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx into these is an important factor in clearance from the presynapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Ono et al., 2019</xref>). Overall, this may explain the increased number of recycling endosomes found in <italic>flwr-1</italic> synapses. For example, effects of <italic>flwr-1</italic> mutations on PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> at the PM may negatively affect bulk endocytosis. Yet effects on PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> at the endosome may have a stronger impact in slowing down breakdown of these endosomes (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8E</xref>). Still, our ultrastructural analysis contrasts EM analyses in <italic>Drosophila</italic> which yielded fewer, rather than more, bulk endosomal structures in animals lacking Flower (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c103">Yao et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Li et al., 2020</xref>). However, this group used an unusually long stimulation period of ten minutes which may result in entirely different outcomes compared to our 30 s optogenetic stimulus. Alternatively, the subcellular localization of Flower function may be different between organisms, since, in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, loss of FLWR-1 seems to delay reformation of SVs from bulk endosomes.</p>
<p>Another possible explanation of how Flower could facilitate endocytosis was suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c103">Yao et al. (2017)</xref>, proposing that calcineurin may function downstream of Flower to stimulate bulk endosome formation. Calcineurin is a Ca<sup>2+</sup>- and calmodulin-dependent phosphatase that activates endocytic proteins by dephosphorylation, thus accelerating recycling of SVs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Cousin and Robinson, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Kumashiro et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c101">Yamashita, 2012</xref>). The Ca<sup>2+</sup> increase, driving calcineurin, would result from effects of FLWR-1 on PMCAs in our model. But how do the increased Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels and the decreased rate of pHluorin decay we observe fit to this idea? One explanation could be that more Ca<sup>2+</sup> and thus more activation of calcineurin induces a shift of the main endocytic mode to ADBE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c101">Yamashita, 2012</xref>). Structures formed by bulk endocytosis are acidified more slowly than small SVs generated by CME, which could explain the delayed decay of pHluorin fluorescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Gross and von Gersdorff, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Okamoto et al., 2016</xref>). These observations are in line with the higher number of endosomal structures in <italic>flwr-1</italic> mutants that we detected by EM. More pronounced neurotransmission, due to increased SV fusion, causes an increase in bulk invaginations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Clayton et al., 2008</xref>), yet the endosomes formed this way are not efficiently disassembled. The <italic>C. elegans</italic> homolog of calcineurin, TAX-6, is also involved in activity-dependent bulk endocytic processes, however in a different context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Miller-Fleming et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Cuentas-Condori et al., 2023</xref>). Here, this protein is rather required for the regeneration of GABAergic synapses during maturation. Thus, the remote possibility that FLWR-1 also takes part in this process needs to be considered, implying that developmental aspects of FLWR-1 function may influence E/I balance even in adult NMJs. Jointly, these ideas suggest that calcineurin/TAX-6 could be upregulated, rather than downregulated, by the increased Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels during neurotransmission in <italic>flwr-1</italic> mutants.</p>
<p>In sum, our work confirms a conserved role of FLWR-1 in neurotransmission and SV recycling even though we observed differences to previous data from <italic>Drosophila</italic> NMJs. We found an unexpected upregulation of neurotransmission in <italic>flwr-1</italic> mutants which has not yet been observed in other animal models. Further investigation will be required to confirm the involvement of MCA-3 and the nature of the relationship between these proteins.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this study, Seidenthal et al. investigated the role of the C. elegans Flower protein, FLWR-1, in synaptic transmission, vesicle recycling, and neuronal excitability. They confirmed that FLWR-1 localizes to synaptic vesicles and the plasma membrane and facilitates synaptic vesicle recycling at neuromuscular junctions, albeit in an unexpected manner. The authors observed that hyperstimulation results in endosome accumulation in flwr-1 mutant synapses, suggesting that FLWR-1 facilitates the breakdown of endocytic endosomes, which differs from earlier studies in flies that suggested the Flower protein promotes the formation of bulk endosomes. This is a valuable finding. Using tissue-specific rescue experiments, the authors showed that expressing FLWR-1 in GABAergic neurons restored the aldicarb-resistant phenotype seen in flwr-1 mutants to wild-type levels. In contrast, FLWR-1 expression in cholinergic neurons in flwr-1 mutants did not restore aldicarb sensitivity, yet muscle expression of FLWR-1 partially but significantly recovered the aldicarb-resistant defects. The study also revealed that removing FLWR-1 leads to increased Ca2+ signaling in motor neurons upon photo-stimulation. Further, the authors conclude that FLWR-1 contributes to the maintenance of the excitation/inhibition (E/I) balance by preferentially regulating the excitability of GABAergic neurons. Finally, SNG-1::pHluorin data imply that FLWR-1 removal enhances synaptic transmission, however, the electrophysiological recordings do not corroborate this finding.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This study by Seidenthal et al. offers valuable insights into the role of the Flower protein, FLWR-1, in C. elegans. Their findings suggest that FLWR-1 facilitates the breakdown of endocytic endosomes, which marks a departure from its previously suggested role in forming endosomes through bulk endocytosis. This observation could be important for understanding how Flower proteins function across species. In addition, the study proposes that FLWR-1 plays a role in maintaining the excitation/inhibition balance, which has potential impacts on neuronal activity.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>One issue is the lack of follow-up tests regarding the relative contributions of muscle and GABAergic FLWR-1 to aldicarb sensitivity. The findings that muscle expression of FLWR-1 can significantly rescue aldicarb sensitivity are intriguing and may influence both experimental design and data interpretation. Have the authors examined aldicarb sensitivity when FLWR-1 is expressed in both muscles and GABAergic neurons, or possibly in muscles and cholinergic neurons? Given that muscles could influence neuronal activity through retrograde signaling, a thorough examination of FLWR-1's role in muscle is necessary, in my opinion.</p>
<p>Would the results from electrophysiological recordings and GCaMP measurements be altered with muscle expression of FLWR-1? Most experiments presented in the manuscript compare wild-type and flwr-1 mutant animals. However, without tissue-specific knockout, knockdown, or rescue experiments, it is difficult to separate cell-autonomous roles from non-cell-autonomous effects, in particular in the context of aldicarb assay results. Also, relying solely on levamisole paralysis experiments is not sufficient to rule out changes in muscle AChRs, particularly due to the presence of levamisole-resistant receptors.</p>
<p>This issue regarding the muscle role of FLWR-1 also complicates the interpretation of results from coelomocyte uptake experiments, where GFP secreted from muscles and coelomocyte fluorescence were used to estimate endocytosis levels. A decrease in coelomocyte GFP could result from either reduced endocytosis in coelomocytes or decreased secretion from muscles. Therefore, coelomocyte-specific rescue experiments seem necessary to distinguish between these possibilities.</p>
<p>The manuscript states that GCaMP was used to estimate Ca2+ levels at presynaptic sites. However, due to the rapid diffusion of both Ca2+ and GCaMP, it is unclear how this assay distinguishes Ca2+ levels specifically at presynaptic sites versus those in axons. What are the relative contributions of VGCCs and ER calcium stores here? This raises a question about whether the authors are measuring the local impact of FLWR-1 specifically at presynaptic sites or more general changes in cytoplasmic calcium levels.</p>
<p>The experiments showing FLWR-1's presynaptic localization need clarification/improvement. For example, data shown in Fig. 3B represent GFP::FLWR-1 is expressed under its own promoter, and TagRFP::ELKS-1 is expressed exclusively in GABAergic neurons. Given that the pflwr-1 drives expression in both cholinergic and GABAergic neurons, and there are more cholinergic synapses outnumbering GABAergic ones in the nerve cord, it would be expected that many green FLWR-1 puncta do not associate with TagRFP::ELKS-1. However, several images in Figure 3B suggest an almost perfect correlation between FLWR-1 and ELKS-1 puncta. It would be helpful for the readers to understand the exact location in the nerve cord where these images were collected to avoid confusion.</p>
<p>The SNG-1::pHluorin data in Figure 5C is significant, as they suggest increased synaptic transmission at flwr-1 mutant synapses. However, to draw conclusions, it is necessary to verify whether the total amount of SNG-1::pHluorin present on synaptic vesicles remains the same between flwr-1 mutant and wild-type synapses. Without this comparison, a conclusion on levels of synaptic vesicle release based on changes in fluorescence might be premature, in particular given the results of electrophysiological recordings.</p>
<p>Finally, the interpretation of the E74Q mutation results needs reconsideration. Figure 8B indicates that the E74Q variant of FLWR-1 partially loses its rescuing ability, which suggests that the E74Q mutation adversely affects the function of FLWR-1. Why did the authors expect that the role of FLWR-1 should have been completely abolished by E74Q? Given that FLWR-1 appears to work in multiple tissues, might FLWR-1's function in neurons requires its calcium channel activity, whereas its role in muscles might be independent of this feature? While I understand there is ongoing debate about whether FLWR-1 is a calcium channel, the experiments in this study do not definitively resolve local Ca2+ dynamics at synapses. Thus, in my opinion, it may be premature to draw firm conclusions about calcium influx through FLWR-1.</p>
<p>Also, the aldicarb data presented in Figures 8B and 8D show notable inconsistencies that require clarification. While Figure 8B indicates that the 50% paralysis time for flwr-1 mutant worms occurs at 3.5-4 hours, Figure 8D shows that 50% paralysis takes approximately 2.5 hours for the same flwr-1 mutants. This discrepancy should be addressed. In addition, the manuscript mentions that the E74Q mutation impairs FLWR-1 folding, which could significantly affect its function. Can the authors show empirical data supporting this claim?</p>

<p>The Flower protein is expressed in various cell types, including neurons. Previous studies in flies have proposed that Flower plays a role in neuronal endocytosis by functioning as a Ca2+ channel. However, its precise physiological roles and molecular mechanisms in neurons remain largely unclear. This study employs C. elegans as a model to explore the function and mechanism of FLWR-1, the C. elegans homolog of Flower. This study offers intriguing observations that could potentially challenge or expand our current understanding of the Flower protein. Nevertheless, further clarification or additional experiments are required to substantiate the study's conclusions.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>A range of approaches was employed, including the use of a flwr-1 knockout strain, assessment of cholinergic synaptic activity via analyzing aldicarb (a cholinesterase inhibitor) sensitivity, imaging Ca2+ dynamics with GCaMP3, analyzing pHluorin fluorescence, examination of presynaptic ultrastructure by EM, and recording postsynaptic currents at the neuromuscular junction. The findings include notable observations on the effects of flwr-1 knockout, such as increased Ca2+ levels in motor neurons, changes in endosome numbers in motor neurons, altered aldicarb sensitivity, and potential involvement of a Ca2+-ATPase and PIP2 binding in FLWR-1's function.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) The observation that flwr-1 knockout increases Ca2+ levels in motor neurons is notable, especially as it contrasts with prior findings in flies. The authors propose that elevated Ca2+ levels in flwr-1 knockout motor neurons may stem from &quot;deregulation of MCA-3&quot; (a Ca2+ ATPase in the plasma membrane) due to FLWR-1 loss. However, this conclusion relies on limited and somewhat inconclusive data (Figure 7). Additional experiments could clarify FLWR-1's role in MCA-3 regulation. For instance, it would be informative to investigate whether mutations in other genes that cause elevated cytosolic Ca2+ produce similar effects, whether MCA-3 physically interacts with FLWR-1, and whether MCA-3 expression is reduced in the flwr-1 knockout.</p>
<p>(2) In silico analysis identified residues R27 and K31 as potential PIP2 binding sites in FLWR-1. The authors observed that FLWR-1(R27A/K31A) was less effective than wild-type FLWR-1 in rescuing the aldicarb sensitivity phenotype of the flwr-1 knockout, suggesting that FLWR-1 function may depend on PIP2 binding at these two residues. Given that mutations in various residues can impair protein function non-specifically, additional studies may be needed to confirm the significance of these residues for PIP2 binding and FLWR-1 function. In addition, the authors might consider explicitly discussing how this finding aligns or contrasts with the results of a previous study in flies, where alanine substitutions at K29 and R33 impaired a Flower-related function (Li et al., eLife 2020).</p>
<p>(3) A primary conclusion from the EM data was that FLWR-1 participates in the breakdown, rather than the formation, of bulk endosomes (lines 20-22). However, the reasoning behind this conclusion is somewhat unclear. Adding more explicit explanations in the Results section would help clarify and strengthen this interpretation.</p>
<p>(4) The aldicarb assay results in Figure 3 are intriguing, indicating that reduced GABAergic neuron activity alone accounts for the flwr-1 mutant's hyposensitivity to aldicarb. Given that cholinergic motor neurons also showed increased activity in the flwr-1 mutant, one might expect the flwr-1 mutant to display hypersensitivity to aldicarb in the unc-47 knockout background. However, this was not observed. The authors might consider validating their conclusion with an alternative approach or, at the minimum, providing a plausible explanation for the unexpected result. Since aldicarb-induced paralysis can be influenced by factors beyond acetylcholine release from cholinergic motor neurons, interpreting aldicarb assay results with caution may be advisable. This is especially relevant here, as FLWR-1 function in muscle cells also impacts aldicarb sensitivity (Figure S3B). Previous electrophysiological studies have suggested that aldicarb sensitivity assays may sometimes yield misleading conclusions regarding protein roles in acetylcholine release.</p>
<p>(5) Previous studies have suggested that the Flower protein functions as a Ca²⁺ channel, with a conserved glutamate residue at the putative selectivity filter being essential for this role. However, mutating this conserved residue (E74Q) in C. elegans FLWR-1 altered aldicarb sensitivity in a direction opposite to what would be expected for a Ca²⁺ channel function. Moreover, the authors observed that E74 of FLWR-1 is not located near a potential conduction pathway in the FLWR-1 tetramer, as predicted by Alphafold3. These findings raise the possibility that Flower may not function as a Ca2+ channel. While this is a potentially significant discovery, further experiments are needed to confirm and expand upon these results.</p>
<p>(6) Phrases like &quot;increased excitability&quot; and &quot;increased Ca2+ influx&quot; are used throughout the manuscript. However, there is no direct evidence that motor neurons exhibit increased excitability or Ca2+ influx. The authors appear to interpret the elevated Ca2+ signal in motor neurons as indicative of both increased excitability and Ca2+ influx. However, this elevated Ca2+ signal in the flwr-1 mutant could occur independently of changes in excitability or Ca2+ influx, such as in cases of reduced MCA-3 activity. The authors may wish to consider alternative terminology that more accurately reflects their findings.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Seidenthal et al. investigated the role of the Flower protein, FLWR-1, in C. elegans and confirmed its involvement in endocytosis within both synaptic and non-neuronal cells, possibly by contributing to the fission of bulk endosomes. They also uncovered that FLWR-1 has a novel inhibitory effect on neuronal excitability at GABAergic and cholinergic synapses in neuromuscular junctions.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This study not only reinforces the conserved role of the Flower protein in endocytosis across species but also provides valuable ultrastructural data to support its function in the bulk endosome fission process. Additionally, the discovery of FLWR-1's role in modulating neuronal excitability broadens our understanding of its functions and opens new avenues for research into synaptic regulation.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The study does not address the ongoing debate about the Flower protein's proposed Ca2+ channel activity, leaving an important aspect of its function unexplored. Furthermore, the evidence supporting the mechanism by which FLWR-1 inhibits neuronal excitability is limited. The suggested involvement of MCA-3 as a mediator of this inhibition lacks conclusive evidence, and a more detailed exploration of this pathway would strengthen the findings.</p>
