<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Membranes undergo various patterns of deformation during vesicle fusion, but how this membrane deformation is regulated and contributes to fusion remains unknown. In this study, we developed a new method of observing the fusion of individual late endosomes and lysosomes by using yolk sac visceral endoderm cells that have huge endocytic vesicles. We found that there were two distinct fusion modes that were differently regulated. In homotypic fusion, two late endosomes fused quickly, whereas in heterotypic fusion they fused to lysosomes slowly. Mathematical modeling showed that vesicle size is a critical determinant of these fusion types and that membrane fluctuation forces can overcome the vesicle size effects. We found that actin filaments were bound to late endosomes and forces derived from dynamic actin remodeling were necessary for quick fusion during homotypic fusion. Furthermore, cofilin played a role in endocytic fusion by regulating actin turnover. These data suggest that actin promotes vesicle fusion for efficient membrane trafficking in visceral endoderm cells.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Eukaryotic cells contain numerous organelles that are separated from the cytoplasm by a lipid bilayer. Exchange of proteins, lipids, and metabolites between the organelles occurs through vesicle budding and fusion. To date, theoretical and computer biophysics have modeled several steps in the process of membrane fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Chernomordik and Kozlov, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Lu and Guo, 2019</xref>). The priming of membranes is followed by the merger of the outer leaflet of the membranes to establish a hemifusion stalk. The stalk then expands into a hemifusion diaphragm and the merger of the inner leaflets leads to the formation of a fusion pore, which expands and allows content mixing. Recently, the hemifusion stage was observed in live cells, providing strong evidence of the hemifusion model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Zhao et al., 2016</xref>).</p>
<p>Studies utilizing time-lapse microscopic observation of live cells, however, have revealed that membrane behavior after pore formation is unexpectedly divergent. For example, in giant endosomal vesicles in cells overexpressing constitutively active Rab5 protein, two different types of membrane fusion were observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Roberts et al., 1999</xref>). In “explosive” fusion, which is commonly seen in cells, the fusion pore expanded quickly. In contrast, in “bridge” fusion, the pore did not expand; instead, one vesicle gradually shrank and disappeared over time as the result of the transfer of its vesicle content into another vesicle. In homotypic vacuole fusion in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae,</italic> vacuole membranes fused at the vertices instead of a central pore expanding radially, and then a boundary membrane between the two docked vacuoles was released into the vacuole lumen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Wang et al., 2002</xref>). Because pore dynamics determine the rate of content mixing, they have significant effects on the trafficking efficiency of cargo molecules. However, how different modes of membrane deformation are induced and whether the distinct fusion modes are exchangeable remain unknown.</p>
<p>Membrane deformation is generally controlled by membrane-associating proteins as well as by several physical parameters including the vesicle volume, membrane area, bending energy, and osmotic energy in cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Farsad and De Camilli, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Lipowsky, 1991</xref>). Actin and its regulating proteins, via interaction with the membrane, exert physical forces on and cause fluctuation in the membrane, which eventually leads to membrane deformation by modification of the physical parameters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Salbreux et al., 2012</xref>). Actin produces forces in two different manners. First, assembly of branched actin filaments, nucleated from the membrane surface by actin nucleators such as the actin-related protein 2/3 (Arp2/3) complex and formins, provides pushing forces on the membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Goley and Welch, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Svitkina, 2018</xref>). Second, actin generates pulling forces through myosin-driven sliding of actin filaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Svitkina, 2018</xref>). Both forces play roles in induction of membrane deformation during vesicle fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Ebrahim et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Ma et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Tran et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Uenishi et al., 2013</xref>). Many experiments have been carried out to elucidate the roles of actin in vesicle fusion through manipulation of actin dynamics by use of specific drugs or gene modifications. These experiments gave rise to different results depending on the experimental conditions. For example, polymerization or stabilization of actin enhanced membrane fusion in some experiments but inhibited it in others (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Eitzen, 2003</xref>). These different results imply that the regulation mechanisms of vesicle fusion by actin filaments is more complex than previously assumed. Moreover, how the actin forces contribute to the fusion modes remains unknown, as does how the force generated by actin polymerization or by actin-dependent motor proteins contributes to membrane deformation during fusion.</p>
<p>In this study, we utilized mouse yolk sac visceral endoderm (VE) cells as a model system for addressing the above questions. VE cells play a critical role in the maternofetal exchange of nutrients before the establishment of a chorioallantoic placenta: they vigorously endocytose maternal proteins, hydrolyze the proteins in lysosomes, and supply the resultant products to the developing embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Bielinska et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Jollie 1990</xref>). Reflecting this high endocytic activity, VE cells are characterized by huge endosomal vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Bielinska et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Kawamura et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Koike et al., 2009</xref>). These properties of VE cells enable us to observe endosomal dynamics including vesicle fusion. Previously, by using a whole embryo culture system combined with specific pharmacologic inhibitors for intracellular signaling molecules, we showed that actin dynamics regulated by lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) receptors and the Rho-ROCK-LIM kinase pathway are required for the formation of huge lysosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Koike et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Here, we show that late endosomes of VE cells exhibit different modes of fusion with target organelles depending on their targets: they undergo homotypic fusion with late endosomes in an explosive fusion-like manner and heterotypic fusion with lysosomes in a bridge fusion-like manner. Our mathematical modeling predicts that the vesicle size is a critical determinant of the fusion types and that membrane perturbation overcomes the size effects. We provide evidence that actin filaments are associated with late endosomes and that actin dynamics generate forces promoting vesicle fusion of endosomes for efficient membrane trafficking.</p>

<title>Endocytic vesicles in mouse yolk sac VE cells</title>
<p>To visualize endosomal vesicles in yolk sac VE cells, an embryonic day 8.5 (E8.5) whole embryo was labeled with a fluorescent membrane probe, FM1-43, and subsequently stained with organelle markers. The embryo was put on a glass-bottom dish, and VE cells were observed by use of confocal microscopy (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). These observations revealed that different types of endosomal vesicles formed three layers from the apical to the basal area in the supranuclear portion of VE cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, B</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">C</xref>). In the most superficial portion (within about 1 μm of the apical surface; designated as zone 1), fuzzy FM1-43 staining was observed (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>). The small vesicles in this zone were positive for EEA1 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>), indicating that they were early endosomes. Immediately beneath zone 1, many medium-sized round vesicles were observed (zone 2). Electroporation of GFP-Rab7 revealed that these vesicles were positive for Rab7, suggesting that they were late endosomes. In the deep portion (zone 3), large amorphous lysosomes, positive for LysoTracker Red and LAMP1, were observed (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Koike et al., 2009</xref>).</p>

<p>To examine whether these vesicles constitute endocytic pathways, we traced vesicle trafficking in VE cells. After E8.5 whole embryos were pulse-labeled with Alexa 488-transferrin for 5 min, fluorescently labeled endocytic vesicles were tracked over time. The fluorescent signals were initially detected in small vesicles (area &lt; 2.0 μm<sup>2</sup>) in zone 1; 10–20 min after labeling, the signals were mainly detected in medium-sized vesicles (2.0–25 μm<sup>2</sup>) in zone 2; 40 min after labeling, the signals were strongly observed in large lysosomes (&gt; 25 μm<sup>2</sup>) in zone 3 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, D</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1E</xref>). The time course of the numbers of labeled vesicles in each zone showed that endocytosed transferrin was rapidly transported from early endosomes to lysosomes via late endosomes in VE cells, as reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Richardson et al., 2000</xref>). In addition, rhodamine-labeled dextran, which was transported by pinocytosis pathways, was also transported to lysosomes in a similar fashion (Fig. S1).</p>

<title>Two distinct modes of late endosomal fusion</title>
<p>To examine the dynamic changes of endocytic vesicles, we performed time-lapse imaging of Alexa 488-transferrin- or FM 1-43-labeled vesicles. We focused on late endosomes in zone 2 because these vesicles were large enough and suitable for microscopic observation of membrane fusion processes, as described below.</p>
<p>First, from 5 min after pulse labeling, fusion of two neighboring late endosomes was observed frequently (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, A</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">B</xref>; Video S1). The fusion showed an explosive mode, in which a membrane pore quickly expanded and two vesicles fused to become a single vesicle (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>). The size distribution of the late endosomes that underwent fusion (7.3 ± 6.6 μm<sup>2</sup>, n = 34) was similar to that of the total late endosomes in the observed area at the start of recording (5.7 ± 6.4 μm<sup>2</sup>, n = 265; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>), indicating that late endosomes of any size underwent homotypic fusion. The fusion was completed within 20–50 s (the time required from membrane fusion to single spherical vesicle formation was 31.9 ± 0.2 s, n = 37), and the time was weakly correlated with the vesicle size (r = 0.60, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>).</p>

<p>Second, from 15 min after pulse labeling, some late endosomes shrank gradually and disappeared from the focal plane (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref> and Video S2). This disappearance appeared to result from the fusion of late endosomes with the underlying lysosomes. This type of fusion, so-called bridge fusion, described in a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Nicot et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Roberts et al., 1999</xref>), occurred as a result of the slow mixing of vesicular contents through a narrow fusion pore. However, it was previously reported that the late endosomes of E6.5 mouse VE cells were engulfed by lysosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Kawamura et al., 2012</xref>). We therefore observed the disappearance of late endosomes in more detail using different approaches. First, we used differential labeling of late endosomes and lysosomes. When whole embryos were incubated with rhodamine-dextran for 20 min and subsequently pulse-labeled with Alexa 488-transferrin for 5 min, lysosomes and late endosomes were labeled with dextran and transferrin, respectively, at the time of observation (15 min after transferrin labeling). In a diminishing late endosome, the fluorescence intensity of transferrin in the vesicle increased initially and then decreased quickly (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3, B–D</xref>). At the same time, the rhodamine-dextran in the adjacent lysosome entered the late endosome (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3, B–D</xref>), indicating that the vesicular contents of the late endosomes and lysosomes were mixed. Second, using electron microscopy, we observed pore formation between a late endosome and a lysosome (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E</xref>). These data suggest that the two vesicles underwent fusion but not engulfment in E8.5 embryos. Heterotypic fusion was slower than homotypic fusion and was completed within 90–250 s (154.8 ± 1.4 s, n = 25), and the fusion time (the time required from membrane fusion to disappearance of the vesicle) did not correlate with the vesicle size (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3F</xref>). The size of the labeled late endosomes at this time point (10.1 ± 8.1 μm<sup>2</sup>, n = 256) was larger than that at 5 min after labeling (6.7 ± 6.2 μm<sup>2</sup>, n = 242), indicating that larger late endosomes tended to undergo heterotypic fusion (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3G</xref>, see also below).</p>

<title>Vesicle size is an important factor for the transition of fusion modes</title>
<p>To examine whether the differences in membrane deformation of late endosomes depend on their fusion targets, we adopted a mathematical modeling approach that describes the membrane deformation processes after pore formation. According to thermodynamics, the deformation of a physical object proceeds as its free energy decreases. The free energy of a vesicle consists of two terms: bending energy and osmotic energy. The bending energy, b, is the integral of the square of the mean curvature all over the surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Helfrich, 1973</xref>). The osmotic energy is the product of the osmotic pressure difference between the inside and the outside of the vesicle, Llp, and the vesicle volume, V. Thus, the free energy is given by
<disp-formula id="ueqn1">
<graphic xlink:href="572077v1_ueqn1.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula></p>
<p>Note that the bending energy depends only on its shape; in other words, two membranes with the same shape but with different sizes have the same bending energy. On the other hand, the volume depends on both the size and the shape. Therefore, the vesicle size intrinsically affects the balance of both energy sources and may be a critical factor for membrane deformation during fusion.</p>
<p>We focused on a closed membrane having a constricted neck region and introduced two shape parameters, the neck width, w, and the area ratio between both sides of the neck, a (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>), so that the basic processes of the two fusion types are described by the changes in w and a just after pore formation, w= 0. The relaxation of the neck in explosive fusion is expressed by the increase in w. On the other hand, the absorption of smaller vesicles by the larger one in bridge fusion is the decrease in a while w remains small.</p>

<p>When calculating the free energy as a function of w and a, the deformation is expressed as the process of descending the free-energy landscape in the space. Because the shape giving the minimum free energy is most likely to be realized, we first specified the minimum-free-energy shape and then calculated the free energy value for each parameter set.</p>
<p>We considered two extreme conditions: the membrane size is sufficiently small or large. In the former case, the osmotic energy is negligible and the free energy is approximated to
<disp-formula id="ueqn2">
<graphic xlink:href="572077v1_ueqn2.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula></p>
<p>The free-energy landscape on the shape parameter space (w, a) is shown in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>. In the latter case, although the osmotic energy is dominant, the bending energy is also not negligible because the bending energy at the neck region becomes considerably large.</p>
<p>Thus, the free energy for the large membrane case is
<disp-formula id="ueqn3">
<graphic xlink:href="572077v1_ueqn3.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
</p>
<p>where <italic>B</italic><sup>neck</sup> is the bending energy at the neck. The free-energy landscape for a vesicle with the projected area of 10 [<italic>m</italic><sup>2</sup>] is shown in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>.</p>
<p>These free-energy landscapes (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4, B</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">C</xref>) clearly differ from each other, implying that they drive different deformation processes. In particular, the contour of the <italic>F</italic><sup>small</sup> landscape around w∼0 is perpendicular to the w axis, whereas the contour of the <italic>Fd</italic><sup>large</sup> landscape is parallel to the w axis. Typical orbits of the shape deformations from the initial condition (<italic>w, a</italic>) = (0.0,0.3) generated by the gradients of the landscape are shown as gray arrows in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4, B</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">C</xref>. The orbit in the <italic>F</italic><sup>small</sup> landscape is characterized by a smooth increase in <italic>w</italic>; i.e., the neck expands quickly (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref>), resulting in explosive fusion. On the other hand, in the <italic>F</italic><sup>large</sup> landscape, a increases through the orbit, whilst <italic>w</italic> remains small, which evokes bridge fusion (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E</xref>).</p>
<p>The deformation processes observed in our modeling seem to be qualitatively consistent with our experimental results showing that the size of the fusion target changes the fusion modes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Next, we made a rough estimate of how much of the vesicle size the mathematical model expects to switch the types of fusion. The typical bending energy of a (spherical) vesicle is <italic>b</italic> ≃2 × 10<sup>-18</sup> [<italic>J</italic>] (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Evans and Rawicz, 1990</xref>). Referring to the density differences in the dominant ions of endosomes and cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Scott and Gruenberg, 2011</xref>), we assume that the total ion difference is in the range of 1– 10 <italic>µm</italic>, and the osmotic pressure difference is Δp ≃ 2.5∼25 [<italic>Pa</italic>]. From these assumptions, 0.22– 1.0 [<italic>µm</italic><sup>2</sup>] would be the vesicle size to switch fusion modes. However, the size of the observed late endosomes (5–20 μm<sup>2</sup> in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3F</xref>) is much larger than the predicted size, suggesting that homotypic fusion between late endosomes should show the bridge fusion mode.</p>
<p>To resolve these inconsistencies, we considered the fluctuation effects. Intracellular membranes receive various fluctuations including thermal noise and active fluctuation from the cytoskeletons and motor proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Biswas et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Chen et al., 2009</xref>). Although orbits descending the F<sup>large</sup> landscape are energetically restricted to keep w small, these fluctuations may force the orbits to deviate from the restricted path (the dashed arrow in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>); i.e., they are expected to induce explosive fusion. Then, we performed Monte-Carlo simulations to generate orbits descending the free-energy landscape with various magnitudes of fluctuations and determined the probabilities of orbits that deviate from the path (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4F</xref>). When we considered only the thermal noise with room temperature with the estimated osmotic pressure difference (Δp ≃ 2.5– 25 [<italic>Pa</italic>]), as for late-endosome-sized vesicles (2.0– 25 [<italic>µm</italic><sup>2</sup>]), the simulation predicts that vesicles will show bridge fusion (the green-shaded region in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4F</xref>). However, if we take into account the fact that a larger fluctuation allows explosive fusion (the blue-shaded region in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4F</xref>), fluctuations generated by the cytoskeleton and motor proteins, much larger than thermal noise, may induce explosive fusion.</p>

<title>Actin filaments are bound to late endosomes in VE cells</title>
<p>Previously we found that lysosome biogenesis was regulated by actin dynamics in VE cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Koike et al., 2009</xref>). To examine the relationship between actin filaments and endocytic vesicles, actin filaments were visualized by use of Alexa 488-phalloidin. Endocytic vesicles were visualized by immunostaining with anti-mouse IgG because IgG is endocytosed from the maternal tissue <italic>in utero</italic> and can be stained without incubation of embryos <italic>in vitro</italic> for the pulse labeling of endosomes. In VE cells, strong signals were detected to be associated with the cell membrane (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5, A–C</xref>). In addition, in zone 1, fuzzy cytoplasmic staining was observed (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>), which appeared to correspond to the actin meshwork in the terminal web. In zone 2, small punctates and short filaments were detected in the cytoplasm (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>) and were bound to the surface of late endosomes (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5, B, B’</xref>, and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">B</xref>’’) and infrequently to lysosomes in zone 3 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5, C, C’</xref>, and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">C</xref>’’). Optical cross-sectional images and 3D reconstruction showed that several rod-like actin filaments, extending from the apical side of VE cells into the cytoplasm, surrounded and held the late endosomes (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5, D–F</xref>). These data indicate that most actin punctates observed in the x-y plane correspond to the cross-sectional images of actin filaments extending in the apical-to-basal direction. In addition, when a fusion protein of an actin-bundling protein, fascin-1, with a red fluorescent protein was expressed in VE cells by electroporation, fascin-1 was highly colocalized with the actin punctates, suggesting that most of the actin punctates surrounding the late endosomes were bundled (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5G</xref>).</p>

<p>To investigate the endosome-associated actin filaments in more detail, we performed high-resolution imaging analysis using a deconvolution technique, which had resolution comparable to super-resolution microscopy. It demonstrated that fine actin filaments extended radially from the endosomal membranes in the x-y plane, in addition to the actin filaments extending in the apical-basal axis (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5H</xref>).</p>
<p>To examine the dynamics of actin filaments associated with late endosomes, E7.5 whole embryos were electroporated with a pEGFP-actin vector, and the EGFP signals in VE cells were observed by use of confocal microscopy 24 h after electroporation. Because high levels of actin overexpression led to the deterioration of cell functions (see white arrows in Fig. S3A), cells expressing low levels of EGFP-actin were selected for analysis: those selected cells were normal in morphology and endocytosis (see white arrowheads in Fig. S3A). Punctate signals of EGFP-actin were seen on the late endosomal membrane similarly to those observed in Alexa 488-phalloidin labeling. Time-lapse imaging showed that some new spots had appeared, others had disappeared, and two actin spots were unified on the membrane surface of endocytic vesicles (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>). To examine the turnover rate of actin spots in VE cells, we performed fluorescence recovery after a photobleaching (FRAP) assay. After EGFP-actin on a late endosome was photobleached, recovery of its fluorescence was measured (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref>). Recovery of actin spots on late endosomes occurred more rapidly than the control recovery measured at the cell surface (t<sub>1/2</sub> = 29.0 s; <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6, C</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">D</xref>). Especially, the recovery of actin spots in the apical area of late endosomes was faster than in the basal area (t<sub>1/2</sub> = 11.5 s in the apical area vs. t<sub>1/2</sub> = 18.9 s in the basal area; <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C</xref>). These results indicated that actin spots on the surface of late endosomes were dynamically regulated, especially in the apical area.</p>

<p>The time-lapse images showed that when late endosomes moved in an x-y plane in zone 2, spots of EGFP-actin were always at the rear-end of the endosomes along the moving direction (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6E</xref>, n = 13). Because it is known that Arp2/3-dependent actin polymerization on the membrane acts as the driving force of the motility of intracellular pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Welch and Way, 2013</xref>) and endosomes/lysosomes in <italic>Xenopus</italic> egg extracts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Taunton et al., 2000</xref>), we examined the localization of Arp2/3 in VE cells to test the possible role of Arp2/3 in endosome migration. When a fusion protein of Arp3-EGFP was expressed in VE cells by electroporation, the EGFP signals were distributed in dots on late endosomes and partially colocalized with phalloidin spots in the x-y plane in zone 2 (Fig. S3B). In addition, Arp3-EGFP signals were always seen at the rear-end of the endosomes along the moving direction (Fig. S3C). Taken together, these data suggest that the radial branched filaments are temporally polymerized to provide the propulsive force on the membrane for intracellular movement.</p>

<title>Actin dynamics regulate homotypic fusion of late endosomes</title>
<p>To examine the roles of actin in late endosomal fusion, we tested whether perturbation of actin dynamics caused defects in vesicle fusion. Treatment with cytochalasin D (a cell-permeable inhibitor of actin polymerization) for 5 min reduced the frequency of homotypic fusion in a dose-dependent manner (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7, A</xref> and <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">B</xref>; Video S3). In addition, it altered the speed and mode of the fusion. Treatment with 0.1 or 1.0 μM cytochalasin D slowed down homotypic fusion (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7, C</xref> and <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">D</xref>; Fig. S4A). After membrane fusion, two endosomes remained in a peanut shape for a long time, indicating slower neck expansion than that in the control cells (Fig. S4A). FM 1-43 labeling revealed that the membranes were rapidly fused, whereas it took a long time for the gourd-shaped vesicles to form a large round vesicle (Fig. S4A). Furthermore, upon 1.0 μM cytochalasin D treatment, about one-third of homotypic fusion showed bridge fusion (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7, C</xref> and <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">E</xref>; Video S4). Therefore, cytochalasin D slowed down the fusion processes and changed the fusion mode to bridge fusion at higher concentrations. These data are consistent with our mathematical model showing that larger fluctuation is necessary for explosive fusion in homotypic fusion of late endosomes (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4F</xref>). Treatment with jasplakinolide (a cell-permeable stabilizer of actin filaments) also reduced the frequency of homotypic fusion in a dose-dependent manner (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7, A</xref> and <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">B</xref>; Video S5), indicating that dynamic actin turnover is required for homotypic fusion.</p>

<p>We next observed the distribution of actin filaments during homotypic fusion. When late endosomes underwent fusion, EGFP-actin punctates were excluded from the membrane docking sites and highly polymerized transiently at both ends of the fusing vesicles (opposite to the docking region) during the rounding period after membrane fusion (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7F</xref>). Fluorescence intensity of EGFP-actin on endosomes was quantitated in the proximal, lateral, and distal regions at the predocking, docking, rounding, and postfusion stages. This analysis indicated that actin filament distribution was spatially regulated during fusion (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7G</xref>, dark gray bar), whereas FM 1-43 distribution, used as an unchanged control, was uniform on the membrane throughout the rounding stages (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7G</xref>, light gray bar). Furthermore, the total fluorescence intensity of EGFP-actin on late endosomes significantly increased transiently after pore formation (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7H</xref>), indicating that actin filaments were polymerized temporarily, not simply distributed differently. Moreover, accumulation of Arp3-EGFP in the distal region during the rounding stage was observed similarly to EGFP-actin accumulation (Fig. S4B), and treatment with CK-666, an Arp2/3 inhibitor, resulted in a decrease in the frequency of homotypic fusion (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7B</xref>) and slowed down homotypic fusion (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7, C</xref> and <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">D</xref>). These results suggest that branched actin filaments nucleated by the Arp2/3 complex on the distal surface of late endosomes are necessary to transform the vesicle into a large round sphere quickly after membrane fusion of late endosomes.</p>

<title>Cofilin-dependent actin dynamics are involved in late endosome fusion</title>
<p>Late endosomes undergo homotypic fusion almost exclusively at the beginning and then switch to heterotypic fusion over time after endocytosis (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9A</xref>). Given that actin plays a different role in homotypic fusion and heterotypic fusion and that pharmacologic changes in actin dynamics shift the fusion mode as shown above, it is suggested that actin dynamics are a critical factor for the transition of fusion modes. Thus, we next decided to look into the regulation of actin dynamics in two different fusion modes. Previously, we found that lysosome biogenesis was regulated by actin dynamics through cofilin downstream of the autotaxin–LPA receptor–Rho–ROCK–LIM kinase pathway in VE cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Koike et al., 2009</xref>). When VE cells were incubated with the S3 peptide, which contains the N-terminal 16 amino acid sequence of cofilin fused to a cell permeation sequence and is used as a competitive inhibitor for LIM kinase and serves as a cofilin activator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Maekawa et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Aizawa et al., 2001</xref>), lysosomes were fragmented in VE cells and the fluorescence intensity of phalloidin in VE cells was reduced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Koike et al., 2009</xref>).</p>

<p>We thus focused on cofilin in endosomal fusion in VE cells. YFP-cofilin showed small punctate staining that colocalized with phalloidin-positive spots in the x-y plane and extended along the phalloidin signal (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9, B</xref> and <xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">C</xref>). When the fluorescence intensity of Alexa 546-phalloidin- and YFP-cofilin-positive filaments was quantitated along the apical-basal axis of late endosomes in zone 2, cofilin was slightly abundant in the apical region, whereas the phalloidin signal was stronger in the basal region (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9D</xref>). A FRAP assay of EGFP-actin on a late endosome showed that treatment of E7.5 whole embryos with the S3 peptide (15 μg/ml) for 24 h resulted in faster turnover of actin filaments of late endosomes when compared with treatment with the RV peptide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Aizawa et al., 2001</xref>), which contains the reverse sequence of cofilin and is used as a negative control (t<sub>1/2</sub> = 10.9 s with the S3 peptide, n = 9 vs t<sub>1/2</sub> = 18.3 s with the RV peptide, n = 9; <xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9E</xref>). These results indicate that cofilin distributes with actin filaments on late endosomes and regulates actin dynamics on late endosomes. Finally, the roles of cofilin in late endosomal fusion were investigated. After treatment with the S3 peptide for 24 h, Alexa 488-transferrin-labeled vesicles were observed by use of time-lapse imaging. When compared with the RV peptide, the S3 peptide strongly inhibited homotypic fusion (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9F</xref>) but not heterotypic fusion (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9G</xref>). These data suggest that spatial differentiation of actin dynamics along the apical-basal direction, partially contributed by cofilin, may be a critical factor for the transition of fusion modes.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we developed a novel imaging method of analyzing the motile behavior of late endosomes in VE cells. By using the technique, we found that VE cells have two different types of vesicle fusion: homotypic fusion between late endosomes and heterotypic fusion between late endosomes and lysosomes. We found that actin filaments were associated with late endosomes and that the forces generated by actin were required for inducing quick fusion of late endosomes and for facilitating transport of late endosomes to lysosomes. We also showed that cofilin plays a role in late endosome fusion via actin turnover (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Fig. 10</xref>).</p>

<caption><title>Summary of late endosome fusion in VE cells</title>
<p>In VE cells, late endosomes (LE) show two different types of fusion with different targets. In homotypic fusion, once a membrane pore is formed between two late endosomes, the pore quickly expands and a single fused vesicle is formed. In contrast, in heterotypic fusion, the pore does not expand; instead, the late endosome gradually shrinks and disappears over time as the result of a transfer of its vesicle content into lysosomes. Two different types of actin are associated with the late endosomal membrane in VE cells: the actin filaments that extend along the apical-to-basal axis and the filaments that are radially polymerized from the membrane. Cofilin, an actin-binding protein that severs and depolymerizes actin filaments activates actin turnover. In the apical region, late endosomes receive squeezing forces via active actin modification by cofilin and Arp2/3, which leads to homotypic fusion in an explosive mode. In contrast, in the basal region, actin is more static and late endosomes receive sliding forces via myosins.</p></caption>

<title>Actin filaments are associated with endosomal vesicles</title>
<p>We found two types of actin filaments associated with late endosomes in VE cells: those that extended along the apical-basal axis and those that extended radially from the endosomes (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>). Our findings resemble the previous observation that early endosomes were distributed along with actin cables and that Arp2/3-dependent small cloud-like patches protruded from the membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Morel et al., 2009</xref>). Actin is reportedly distributed around vesicles in different patterns. In addition to the well-known interaction of vesicles with actin rails in directional vesicle transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Titus, 2018</xref>), actin was localized at the vertex ring in vacuole fusion in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Wang et al., 2002</xref>) and entirely surrounded phagosomes in macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Liebl and Griffiths, 2009</xref>). Advanced microscopy techniques have clarified the fine structure of actin, which is assembled into polyhedron-like lattices around vesicles in exocrine glands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Ebrahim et al., 2019</xref>).</p>
<p>We observed strong actin signals as patches on late endosomes in the focal planes in confocal microscopy. Three-dimensional reconstruction showed that most of these patches represent the cross-section of rod-shaped actin filaments extending from the apical side into the cytoplasm in VE cells. In addition to these patches, some signals seem to represent actin filaments extending radially from membranes. Although it is difficult to distinguish between these two types of patches by use of conventional confocal microscopy, we successfully observed finer actin filaments extending radially from the endosomal membranes by use of high-resolution imaging analysis. Furthermore, we showed that Arp3-positive actin spots appeared in the site opposite to that of endosome movement (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6E</xref>, Fig. S3C) like a comet tail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Goley and Welch, 2006</xref>), that Arp3-positive actin spots were asymmetrically distributed and temporarily polymerized in the distal region during endosomal fusion (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7, F</xref> and <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">G</xref>; Fig. S4B), and that Arp2/3 inhibition reduced homotypic fusion (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7B</xref>). These results suggest that radial actin filaments polymerized by Arp2/3 generate force for homotypic fusion in VE cells. This notion is compatible with the findings of previous reports that the radial filaments were nucleated and extended with Arp2/3-dependent branches on the lateral membrane of endosomes to push vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Goley and Welch, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Svitkina, 2018</xref>). Given that nucleation and Arp2/3 activities are regulated by nucleation-promoting factors (NPFs; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Goley and Welch, 2006</xref>), the activity of NPFs and membrane fusion processes are likely tightly linked to accurate membrane fusion. Differential regulation of NPF activity may give rise to different patterns of actin surrounding vesicles and membrane dynamics. Future investigation is necessary to elucidate how the NPF activity is spatially and temporally regulated on membranes.</p>

<title>Actin regulates membrane behavior after pore formation</title>
<p>In this study, we found that the membranes of late endosomes behave differently depending on the fusion mode. In homotypic fusion, the fusion pore formed between docked endosomal vesicles expanded quickly and the fusion was completed within 20— 30 s (explosive fusion, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). In contrast, in heterotypic fusion with lysosomes, the pore opened very slowly and late endosomes gradually shrank in diameter and disappeared over 1—2 min (bridge fusion, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). Using mathematical modeling, we showed that vesicle size is an important factor determining the fusion mode. When the size of the vesicle becomes larger, the free energy for neck relaxation decreases and the pore is kept small. Our modeling predicted that the late endosomes are large enough to allow bridge fusion to occur, although they exhibit explosive fusion <italic>in vivo</italic>. Similarly, homotypic fusion in an explosive mode was observed in very large vesicles, such as vacuoles in yeast, endosomal vesicles in coelomocytes of <italic>C. elegans</italic>, and secretory granules in the salivary glands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Liu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Masedunskas et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Wang et al., 2002</xref>). These observations indicate that vesicle size is not the sole factor determining the fusion mode. Lipid composition, a well-known parameter affecting its bending modulus, is also involved but the effect on fusion mode may be less dominant when compared with the vesicle size effects (Simon et al., 1998; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Faizi et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Ridolfi et al., 2021</xref>). One of the critical factors other than vesicle size that determine the fusion mode is membrane fluctuation. We found that homotypic fusion was converted to bridge-like fusion after cytochalasin D treatment (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7C</xref>), which suggests that actin dynamics around vesicles cause fluctuation and affect the fusion modes. This finding can be successfully explained by introducing minor modifications in our mathematical modeling so that a larger fluctuation can shift the fusion mode from bridge to explosive fusion.</p>
<p>VE cells vigorously endocytose maternal proteins and supply the digested products to the developing embryo to support embryonic development. This seems to be why VE cells have such huge endosomal and lysosomal vesicles. However, larger vesicle size leads to the reduction in the vesicle fusion speed and subsequent nutrient trafficking efficiency. If vesicle size were the only factor determining the fusion mode, this disadvantage would occur, but if fluctuation is taken into account, it can be overcome, as shown in our mathematical modeling, and the forces generated by actin are thought to be responsible for increasing the rate of vesicular trafficking. This idea is supported by previous reports that knockout mice of actin-related genes (e.g., Arc and NM IIA) showed abnormal VE cells and embryonic lethality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Conti et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Liu et al., 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>In heterotypic fusion, late endosomes fused with lysosomes in a bridge-like manner. This may be because lysosomes are too large in comparison with late endosomes and actin accumulation on the lysosomal membrane is scarce, resulting in insufficient force of actin for explosive fusion. Bridge fusion was previously observed in live cells only when giant vesicles were artificially generated by gene modification, for example, in endosomes enlarged by expression of constitutively-active Rab5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Roberts et al., 1999</xref>) and lysosomes enlarged in the intestinal cells of <italic>ppk-3</italic>-deleted <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Nicot et al., 2006</xref>). These findings suggest that the enlargement of these vesicles exceeds the intrinsic forces of actin to induce explosive fusion.</p>
<p>Like homotypic fusion, heterotypic fusion is also dependent on actin, as shown by reduction in fusion frequency upon cytochalasin D treatment. Intriguingly, in heterotypic fusion, NM II, myosin V, and stabilized actin filaments, but not Arp2/3, were required, indicating a distinct contribution of actin to heterotypic fusion when compared with homotypic fusion. We showed that, consistent with the well-known roles of myosin V in trafficking of lysosomes, ER, melanosomes, and synaptic vesicles (Hammer III and Sellers, 2011), myosin V facilitates the directional transport of late endosomes towards lysosomes along stabilized actin filaments that serve as a rail. Moreover, our results indicate that NM II, which is primarily responsible for generating contractile force (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Svitkina, 2018</xref>), partially contributes to heterotypic fusion. It is well established that NM II facilitates the constriction of the membrane into the plasma membrane after membrane pore formation in exocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Ebrahim et al., 2019</xref>) in cooperation with actin depolymerization by cofilin-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Miklavc et al., 2015</xref>). In contrast, our data showed that actomyosin appeared not to form the lattice on the surface of endosomes for the contraction and that cofilin does not show a robust influence on heterotypic fusion. Rather, actin stabilization tended to promote heterotypic fusion. These data suggest that NM II may contribute to heterotypic fusion through a different mechanism from that of exocytosis. NM II is also implicated in the movement of the nucleus along with cell migration, which is akin to a “conveyor-belt” by the sliding of the nuclear membrane along the actin filament (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Gomes et al., 2005</xref>). Further investigation is necessary to elucidate the mechanisms by which NM II transports late endosomes along actin filaments.</p>

<title>Determination of fusion targets</title>
<p>Late endosomes, which fuse frequently with neighboring late endosomes, shift the target of fusion towards lysosomes. What triggers the transition of the fusion targets? We found that larger endosomes tend to fuse with lysosomes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3G</xref>). Thus, one possibility is that the larger endosomes located in the basal position have a higher opportunity to fuse with lysosomes than do the smaller endosomes in the more apical portion. However, upon treatment with jasplakinolide, even smaller endosomes distributing in the more apical area underwent heterotypic fusion with lysosomes (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8, A</xref> and <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">B</xref>), thus suggesting rather that the size and the position of vesicles are not the sole factors and that the different dynamics of actin shift the fusion modes. Furthermore, we showed weaker actin polymerization/depolymerization activity in the basal area as compared with that in the apical area (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C</xref>), a decrease in the frequency of homotypic fusion but not of heterotypic fusion induced by S3 peptide treatment (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9, F-G</xref>), and an increase in actin filaments on endosomes in the basal area as compared with in the apical area (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9D</xref>). These findings support the notion that cofilin-dependent regulation of actin polymerization/depolymerization may play a critical role in determination of the fusion target. In parallel with VE cells, it was shown that cofilin was specifically distributed in the apical area of epithelial cells and was highly active under the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Morris et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Vitriol et al., 2013</xref>). Cofilin regulates actin remodeling for lamellipodia formation and endosomal trafficking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Harrington et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Vitriol et al., 2013</xref>). Furthermore, early endosomes located close to the plasma membrane fuse frequently when compared with late endosomes located at the perinuclear region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Gruenberg et al., 1989</xref>). Taken together, higher dynamics of actin filaments regulated by cofilin at the cell peripheral area may increase the fusion frequency in many cells.</p>
<p>In this study, we developed a method of observing and manipulating late endosomes in VE cells. This method enables, for the first time, the observation of fusion of single vesicles with two different targets and is very useful to examine the molecular mechanisms that determine the fusion targets of vesicles and regulate different fusion modes.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This manuscript employs yolk sac visceral endoderm cells as a novel model for studying endosomal fusion, observing two distinct fusion behaviors: quick homotypic fusion between late endosomes, and slower heterotypic fusion between late endosomes and lysosomes. The mathematical modeling suggests that vesicle size critically influences the mode of fusion. Further investigations reveal that actin filaments are dynamically associated with late endosomal membranes, and are oriented in the x-y plane and along the apical-basal axis. Actin and Arf2/3 were shown to appear at the rear end of the endosomes along the moving direction suggesting polymerization of actin may provide force for the movement of endosomes. Additionally, the authors found that actin dynamics regulate homotypic and heterotypic fusion events in a different manner. The authors also provide evidence to suggest that Cofilin-dependent actin dynamics are involved in late endosome fusion.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The unique feature of this study is that the authors use yolk sac visceral endoderm cells to study endosomal fusion. Yolk sac visceral endoderm cells have huge endocytic vesicles, endosomes, and lysosomes, offering an excellent system to explore endosomal fusion dynamics and the assembly of cellular factors on membranes. The manuscript provides a valuable and convincing observation of the modes of endosomal fusion and the roles of actin dynamics in this process, and the conclusions of the study are justified by the data.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>While the study offers compelling observations, it falls short of delivering clear mechanistic insights. Key questions remain unaddressed, such as the functional significance of actin filaments that extend apically in positioning late endosomes, the ways in which actin dynamics influence fusion events, and the functional implications of the slower bridge fusion process.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Seiichi Koike et al. studied two fusion models, explosive fusion, and bridge fusion, utilizing yolk sac visceral endoderm cells. They elucidated these two fusion models in vivo by employing mathematical modeling and incorporating fluctuations derived from actin dynamics as a key regulator for rapid homotypic fusion between late endosomes.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This study uncovered the role of actin dynamics in regulating the transition of fusion models in homotypic fusion between late endosomes and introduced a method for observing the fusion of single vesicles with two different targets. The role of actin dynamics in vesicle fusion in other systems has been extensively studied. This study could offer useful insights for research on vesicle fusion.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
The physiological significance of different fusion models is lacking.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors found two endosomal fusion modes by live cell imaging of endosomes in yolk sac lateral endoderm cells of 8.5-day-old embryonic mice and described the fusion modes by mathematical models and simulations. They also showed that actin polymerization is involved in the regulation of one of the fusion modes.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The strength of this study is that the authors' claims are well supported by beautiful live cell images and theoretical models. By using specialized cells, yolk sac visceral endoderm cells, the live images of endosomal fusion, localization of actin-related molecules, and validation data from multiple inhibitor experiments are clear.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>This study does not include any assessment of whether the two types of endosome fusions claimed by the authors occur in general cells, so the article is limited to showing a phenomenon specific to yolk sac lateral endoderm cells. Also, the study does not show the physiological importance of the two types of fusion. There are some unclear points in the method of image analysis and some of the descriptions in the text are not logical.</p>
