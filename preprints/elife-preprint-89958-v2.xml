<title>Abstract</title><p>Cells fine-tune microtubule assembly in both space and time, to give rise to distinct edifices with specific cellular functions. In proliferating cells, microtubules are highly dynamics, and proliferation cessation often leads to their stabilization. One of the most stable microtubule structures identified to date is the nuclear bundle assembled in quiescent yeast. In this report, we characterize the original multistep process driving the assembly of this structure. This AuroraB-dependent mechanism follows a precise temporality that relies on the sequential actions of kinesin-14, kinesins-5 and involves both microtubule-kinetochore and kinetochore-kinetochore interactions. Upon quiescence exit, the microtubule bundle is disassembled via a cooperative process involving kinesin-8 and its full disassembly is required prior to cells re-entry into proliferation. Overall, our study provides the first description, at the molecular scale, of the entire life cycle of a stable microtubule structure <italic>in vivo</italic>, and sheds light on its physiological function.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Microtubules (MTs) are hollow cylindrical polymers assembled by the non-covalent interaction of α- and β-tubulin heterodimers. MTs are generally nucleated at MT organizing centers (MTOC) by a ɣ-tubulin complex (ɣ-TuC) which acts as a template and stabilizes the so-called MT “minus-end” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Liu et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Roostalu and Surrey, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Sanchez and Feldman, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Thawani and Petry, 2021</xref>). At the opposite end, the “plus-end” (+end), MTs elongate by the addition of GTP tubulin. The β-tubulin bound GTP is hydrolyzed, and stable but transient, GDP + Pi intermediates are generated in the region immediately behind the growing +end. Subsequent Pi release favors MT depolymerization which can be rescued by <italic>de novo</italic> GTP-tubulin addition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Cleary and Hancock, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Gudimchuk and McIntosh, 2021</xref>). Thus, MTs alternate between periods of growth and shrinkage, a behavior termed dynamic instability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Mitchison and Kirschner, 1984</xref>). <italic>In vivo</italic>, a profusion of MT-associated proteins (MAPs) regulate MT length and dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Bodakuntla et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Goodson and Jonasson, 2018</xref>). In addition, MTs are often assembled from multiple tubulin variants or isotypes, and are modified by a cohort of post-translational modifications that modulate MT dynamics directly or by influencing the recruitment of MAPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Janke and Magiera, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Roll-Mecak, 2020</xref>). Other MAPs organize MTs into highly-ordered assemblies either by cross-linking MTs or by connecting them with cellular structures such as membranes, chromosomes, or actin cytoskeleton components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Bodakuntla et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Meiring et al., 2020</xref>). Cells fine-tune these mechanisms in both space and time to give rise to distinct MT edifices with specific functions.</p>
<p>In proliferating cells, MT dynamics are crucial for their functions. It allows exploration of the cell volume in search of structures to “capture”, such as centromeres during mitosis, or to exert pushing or pulling forces required for various cellular processes such as cell migration or morphogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Heald and Khodjakov, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Kirschner and Mitchison, 1986</xref>). The MT cytoskeleton can undergo extensive rearrangements and assemble more stable MT structures, especially when cells change fate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Meiring et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Röper, 2020</xref>). For example, in terminally differentiated cells, such as epithelial cells, cardiomyocytes or neurons, stable MT networks make up the majority, and ensure critical cellular functions such as cell shape maintenance or long-distance intracellular transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Baas et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Muroyama and Lechler, 2017</xref>). Defects in MT stabilization are at the origin of many human pathologies, including neurodegenerative diseases and ciliopathies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Anvarian et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">Wheway et al., 2018</xref>). Effectors responsible for MT stabilization have been actively searched for since the 1980’s. In mammals, the involvement of specific MAPs such as Tau, MAP2, MAP6 and PRC1, or tubulin post-translational modifications has been extensively studied. While their contributions to MT stabilization are central and undisputed, their sole actions do not fully explain the observed levels of MT stability in many types of non-dividing cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Hahn et al., 2019</xref>).</p>
<p>For years, yeast species have been instrumental in unraveling mechanisms that regulate MT dynamics in eukaryotes. While proliferating yeast cells exhibit a dynamic MT network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">Winey and Bloom, 2012</xref>), proliferation cessation goes with the formation of dramatically stable MT structures in both <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and <italic>S. pombe</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Laporte and Sagot, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Laporte et al., 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">2015</xref>). Upon quiescence establishment, <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> cells assemble a bundle composed of stable parallel MTs, hereafter referred to as the Q-nMT bundle, for <underline>Q</underline>uiescent-cell <underline>n</underline>uclear <underline>M</underline>icro<underline>t</underline>ubule bundle. This structure originates from the nuclear side of the spindle pole body (SPB), the yeast equivalent of the centrosome. It spans the entire nucleus and relocalizes kinetochores and centromeres, which remain attached to MT +ends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Laporte and Sagot, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Laporte et al., 2013</xref>). Because the MTs embedded in the Q-nMT bundle are not all of the same length, the structure has a typical arrow shape. When cells exit quiescence, the Q-nMT bundle depolymerizes and, by pulling the attached centromeres back to the SPB, allows the recovery of the typical Rabl-like configuration of chromosomes found in G1 yeast cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Jin et al., 1998</xref>). The molecular mechanisms underlying the formation of this peculiar stable MT structure and its physiological function(s) are not understood. However, cells defective in Q-nMT bundle formation have a compromised survival in quiescence and a drastically reduced fitness upon cell cycle re-entry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Laporte and Sagot, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Laporte et al., 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">2015</xref>).</p>
<p>Here, we show that Q-nMT bundle formation is a multistep process that follows a precise temporal sequence. The first step relies on AuroraB/Ipl1 activity and requires the kinesin-14 Kar3, its regulator Cik1, and the EB1 homolog Bim1. It leads to the formation of a short (≈ 1 µm) and stable bundle that resembles a half mitotic spindle. Importantly, in this first step, MT polymerization and stabilization are coupled. In a second step, additional MTs polymerize from the SPB, elongate, and are zipped to pre-existing MTs in a Cin8/kinesin-5 dependent manner. Complete stabilization of the Q-nMT bundle is achieved in a third and final step that requires the kinesin-5 Kip1. Our observations further indicate that Q-nMT bundle assembly requires both MT-kinetochore attachment and inter-kinetochore interactions. Finally, we show that, upon exit from quiescence, the Q-nMT bundle disassembles from its +ends, each MT depolymerizing in coordination with its neighbors, via the action of the depolymerase Kip3, a member of the kinesin-8 family. Importantly we show that the complete disassembly of the Q-nMT bundle is required for cells to re-enter the proliferation cycle. Overall, this study describes the entire life cycle of a MT structure, from the molecular mechanisms involved in its formation and stabilization to its disassembly and further suggests that this atypical quiescent specific structure acts as a regulator, or “control point”, for cell cycle resumption upon exit from quiescence.</p>

<title>The Q-nMT bundle formation is a three-step process</title>
<p>We have previously shown that the Q-nMT bundle observed in quiescent cells is a stable nuclear structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Laporte et al., 2013</xref>). To investigate whether the stabilization of the Q-nMT bundle was concomitant with its assembly or whether it assembled first as a dynamic structure, and then gets stabilized, we quantified the Q-nMT bundle length (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>) and thickness (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>) upon quiescence establishment following carbon source exhaustion. We found that the Q-nMT bundle assembly process could be divided into 3 sequential phases. In an initial phase (phase I), MTs elongated from the SPB to reach ≈0.8 µm. The number of these MTs, referred to as phase I-MTs, was approximately the same as in a mitotic spindle (see inset of <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref> and Sup. Fig. 1A). Importantly, phase I-MTs were resistant to nocodazole (Noc), a MT poison that causes dynamic MT depolymerization, indicating that phase I-MT stabilization was concomitant with their polymerization (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A-B</xref>). In a second phase, beginning ≈10h after glucose exhaustion, additional MTs emerged from the SPB (phase II-MTs) and elongated along phase-I MTs, nearly doubling the thickness of the phase I MT bundle (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref> and Sup. Fig. 1A). At this stage, the tip of the newly elongated MTs were unstable (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A-B</xref>). Complete stabilization of the Q-nMT bundle was achieved ≈48h after glucose exhaustion (phase III). Indeed, after this step, a Noc treatment did not affect either the length or the thickness of the Q-nMT bundle (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A-B</xref> and Sup. Fig. 1B). Plotting Q-nMT bundle width as a function of length for each individual cell, before and after Noc treatment further revealed the 3 successive phases of the Q-nMT bundle formation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>). Of note, Q-nMT bundles were also observed both in diploid cells upon glucose exhaustion (Sup. Fig. 1C) and in haploid cells transferred to water (Sup. Fig. 1D).</p>

</fig>
<p>To confirm the above observations, first, we followed Nuf2-GFP, a protein that localizes to the MT +end. As expected, movies showed that upon Q-nMT bundle formation initiation, Nuf2-GFP signal relocated from the SPB to the distal part of elongating Q-nMT bundles (Sup. Fig. 1E). In phase II, when cells were treated with Noc, the Nuf2-GFP signal followed depolymerizing MTs (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>, left panel), testifying for the instability of phase II-MTs. In contrast, the Nuf2-GFP signal remained immobile upon Noc treatment in phase III, as cells have fully stabilized Q-nMT bundles (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>, right panel). Second, we measured the γ-tubulin (Tub4) signal at the SPB and found that Tub4 started to accumulate at the SPB at the beginning of phase I to reach a plateau at the end of phase II (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref> and Sup. Fig. 1F). Interestingly, the amount of Tub4 at the SPB was proportional to the thickness of the Q-nMT bundle (Sup. Fig. 1G). Finally, in order to confirm the two waves of MT elongation, we developed a strain expressing mTQZ-Tub1 from the endogenous TUB1 promoter and mRuby-TUB1 under the ADH2 promoter, a promoter that is derepressed after glucose exhaustion, as confirmed by western blot (Sup. Fig. 1H). We observed that mRuby-TUB1 was incorporated into the Q-nMT bundle only after phase I (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F</xref> and Sup. Fig. 1H), confirming the existence of a second wave of MT elongation during phase II. All the above experiments led us to propose the model shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G</xref>.</p>

<title>Q-nMT bundle formation is an essential time-regulated process</title>
<p>Increasing cytoplasmic viscosity has been shown to dampen MT dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Molines et al., 2022</xref>). Upon quiescence establishment, yeast cells undergo a transition from a fluid phase to a solid-like phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Munder et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Joyner et al., 2016</xref>) and an acidification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Jacquel et al., 2021</xref>) which could contribute to the formation of the Q-nMT bundle. Several lines of evidence suggest that these changes in physicochemical properties are not involved in Q-nMT formation. First, 4-day-old quiescent cells can simultaneously display both dynamic cytoplasmic MTs (cMTs) and a stable Q-nMT bundle (Sup. Fig. 1I and (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Laporte et al., 2013</xref>)). Second, when we mimicked a fluid phase to solid-like transition in proliferating cells by artificially lowering the pH, no stable MTs were observed, whereas F-actin aggregation was induced (Sup. Fig. 1J) as expected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Peters et al., 2013</xref>). Third, 2-day-old quiescent cells exhibiting a phase III Q-nMT bundle were able to grow <italic>de novo</italic> dynamic cMTs after a pulse-chase Noc treatment (Sup. Fig. 1K).</p>
<p>Importantly, if Q-nMT bundle formation was solely dependent on physicochemical changes, this structure should be able to assemble in late quiescence. By treating cells with Noc upon glucose exhaustion, we were able to prevent the formation of the Q-nMT bundle in early quiescence (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1H</xref>). Strikingly, when the drug was washed out, no Q-nMT bundle assembled, even 144h after Noc removal (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1H</xref>). These cells had entered quiescence because they had assembled actin bodies (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1H</xref>, right panel), another quiescent cell-specific structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Sagot et al., 2006</xref>). This experiment strongly suggests that Q-nMT formation is a process induced by a transient signal emitted upon glucose exhaustion.</p>
<p>We have previously shown that mutants unable to assemble Q-nMT bundles have reduced viability in quiescence and a reduced ability to form colonies upon exit from quiescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Laporte et al., 2013</xref>). To establish a direct link between the absence of the Q-nMT bundle and the above phenotypes, we took advantage of our ability to conditionally prevent Q-nMT bundle formation in WT cells using Noc treatment at the onset of glucose exhaustion. As shown in Sup. Fig. 1L, in the absence of the Q-nMT bundle, WT cells lose viability in quiescence and survivors have a reduced ability to generate a progeny upon exit from quiescence. In contrast, a similar Noc treatment of cells that have already assembled a stable Q-nMT bundle (5-day-old cells) did not affect either the viability in quiescence or quiescence exit efficiency, demonstrating that Noc does not have a toxic effect <italic>per se</italic>. Taken together, these experiments confirm our initial findings that the Q-nMT bundle is important for both cell survival during chronological aging and quiescence exit fitness.</p>

<title>Steady state tubulin levels and Tub3 isotype are critical for Q-nMT bundle formation</title>
<p>We then focused on deciphering the molecular mechanisms involved in Q-nMT bundle formation. Yeast cells express two α-tubulin isotypes, Tub1 and Tub3. In proliferating cells, Tub1 constitutes the majority (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Aiken et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Nsamba et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Schatz et al., 1986</xref>). In 4-day-old cells, the two α-tubulin isotypes were found embedded in the Q-nMT bundle. This was observed using two different pairs of fluorescent proteins in order to avoid any influence of the FP variants, using both widefield and by expansion microscopy (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref> and Sup. Fig. 2A). Since Tub3 stabilizes MTs <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Bode et al., 2003</xref>), it may be key for Q-nMT bundle formation. To test this hypothesis, we first analyzed the phenotype of <italic>tub3Δ</italic> cells. In phase II, <italic>tub3Δ</italic> cells displayed short MT bundles that were sensitive to Noc. In phase III, no MT bundles were detected (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref> and Sup. Fig. 2C). Thus, in this mutant, the MT bundles assembled during phase I were not stable and eventually collapsed. In <italic>tub3Δ</italic> cells, the steady-state amount of α-tubulin is significantly reduced (Sup. Fig. 2B and (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Nsamba et al., 2021</xref>)). Thus, the amount of α-tubulin, but not Tub3 itself, may be important for Q-nMT bundle formation. Indeed, mutants defective in α- and β-tubulin folding, such as the prefolding complex mutants <italic>pac10Δ</italic>, <italic>gim3Δ</italic> or <italic>yke2Δ,</italic> or in tubulin heterodimer formation, such as <italic>pac2Δ</italic>, or in β-tubulin folding, such as <italic>cin2Δ</italic> or <italic>cin4Δ</italic>, all of which have a reduced amount of tubulin, were unable to assemble a Q-nMT bundle (Sup.

<p>To identify the role of Tub3 <italic>per se</italic>, we took advantage of the “<italic>Tub1-only</italic>” mutant, in which the <italic>TUB3</italic> gene was replaced by the <italic>TUB1</italic> gene at the <italic>TUB3</italic> locus. This mutant expresses only Tub1 and has an α-tubulin level similar to WT (Sup. Fig. 2B and (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Nsamba et al., 2021</xref>)). We found that “<italic>Tub1-only</italic>” cells have unstable Q-nMT bundles in phase II, and shorter yet stable Q-nMT bundles in phase III (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref> and Sup. Fig2. C). Moreover, “<italic>Tub1-only</italic>” Q-nMT bundles were thinner than WT Q-nMT bundles (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>). Taken together, our data indicate that Tub3 is involved in MT elongation in phase II, since in the absence of this isotype, phase I MT bundles could assemble and MT bundles could get stabilized in phase III, but the second wave of MT nucleation and elongation was impaired as testified by thinner Q-nMT bundles in both phase II and III.</p>

<title>Kinetochores are critical for phase I but dispensable for the maintenance of Q-nMT bundles</title>
<p>Kinetochore components are enriched at the Q-nMT bundle +end ((<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Laporte et al., 2013</xref>) and Sup. Fig. 3A). We therefore tested whether kinetochore-MT attachment might play a role in Q-nMT bundle formation. First, we disrupted kinetochore-MT attachment upon glucose exhaustion using the well-established <italic>ndc80-1</italic> allele (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Cheeseman et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">DeLuca et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">Wigge et al., 1998</xref>). As shown in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>, only very short MT structures were detected in <italic>ndc80-1</italic> cells transferred to 37°C at the onset of quiescence entry, even after 4 days at non-permissive temperature (for control see Sup. Fig. 3B). Second, we focused on the chromosome passenger complex (CPC: Bir1/Survivin, Sli15/INCENP, Nbl1/Borealin and Ipl1/Aurora B), a complex known to regulate kinetochore-MT attachment dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Cairo and Lacefield, 2020</xref>). We found that inactivation of <italic>IPL1</italic> upon entry into quiescence using the thermosensitive allele <italic>ipl1-1</italic> prevented Q-nMT bundle formation (Sup. Fig. 3C). The absence of Q-nMT bundles in cells harboring the NA-PP1 kinase-sensitive allele <italic>ipl1-5as</italic> indicated that the Ipl1 kinase activity was required for this process (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref> and Sup. Fig. 3D-E for controls). While we could not detect Ipl1 and Nbl1 in quiescent cells, we found that Sli15-GFP and Bir1-GFP localized along the Q-nMT bundle with an enrichment at the Q-nMT bundle +end (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>). In 4-day-old <italic>bir1Δ</italic> cells, Q-nMT bundle were shorter and not fully stabilized (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>). In addition, inactivation of <italic>SLI15</italic> upon glucose exhaustion using the thermosensitive allele <italic>sli15-3</italic> drastically impaired Q-nMT bundle formation (Sup. Fig. 3F). Finally, we examined the involvement of Bim1. Bim1 is a MT +end binding protein that plays a role in kinetochore MT-end on attachment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Dudziak et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Thomas et al., 2016</xref>) and localizes along the entire Q-nMT bundle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Laporte et al., 2013</xref>). In fact, we found that the amount of Bim1 correlated with tubulin incorporation during Q-nMT bundle formation (Sup. Fig. 3G). Bim1 deletion alone has no effect on Q-nMT bundle formation even in the presence of Noc ((<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Laporte et al., 2013</xref>) and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>). However, <italic>bim1Δ bir1Δ</italic> cells barely assembled MT structures, and these structures were sensitive to Noc (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>). This demonstrates that in the absence of Bim1, Bir1 is critical for Q-nMT bundle stabilization in phase I. Of note, we found that the viability of <italic>bim1Δ bir1Δ</italic> cells in quiescence was drastically reduced (Sup. Fig. 3H). Together, these experiments show that kinetochore-MT attachments are critical for the initiation of Q-nMT bundle formation upon entry into quiescence.</p>

<p>We then hypothesized that inter-kinetochore interactions could stabilize parallel MTs embedded in the Q-nMT bundle. To test this idea, we analyzed MT organization in s<italic>lk19Δ</italic> cells which are defective in kinetochore clustering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Richmond et al., 2013</xref>). In quiescence, Slk19-GFP was enriched at both ends of the Q-nMT bundles (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E</xref>). s<italic>lk19Δ</italic> cells displayed shorter and thinner MT structures that were sensitive to Noc (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3F</xref>). Since Bim1 has been implicated in kinetochore-kinetochore interaction, we combined s<italic>lk19Δ</italic> with <italic>bim1Δ.</italic> MT structures detected in s<italic>lk19Δ bim1Δ</italic> cells barely reached ≈1 µm and disappeared upon Noc treatment. In addition, in s<italic>lk19Δ bim1Δ</italic> cells, kinetochores localized as a rosette around the SPB (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3F</xref>) and s<italic>lk19Δ bim1Δ</italic> cell viability was severely impaired (Sup. Fig. 3H). This demonstrates that in the absence of Bim1, Slk19 is required for MT bundling and stabilization in phase I. We then focused on monopolin (Mam1, Lrs4, Hrr25 and Csm1), a complex that is known to cross-link kinetochores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Corbett et al., 2010</xref>)). These proteins were found to be expressed in quiescent cells (Sup <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3I</xref>) and when we analyzed the phenotype of <italic>mam1Δ, lrs4Δ</italic> and <italic>csm1Δ</italic> cells in quiescence, most of them displayed short MT structures often arranged in a star-like array (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3G-H</xref> and Sup. Fig. 3J). As for <italic>bir1Δ</italic> and <italic>slk19Δ</italic>, the combination of <italic>bim1Δ</italic> with monopolin deletion worsened MT structure length and stability (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3H</xref>) as well as cell viability in quiescence (Sup. Fig. 3H). Furthermore, cells deleted for <italic>SPO13</italic>, a gene encoding a protein involved in monopolin recruitment to kinetochores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Lee et al., 2004</xref>) showed similar phenotypes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3G-H</xref> and Sup. Fig. 3H). Collectively, these experiments demonstrate that inter-kinetochore interactions are critical for Q-nMT bundle assembly.</p>
<p>Finally, we investigated whether kinetochore-MT interactions were required for the stability of the Q-nMT bundle once it is formed. In 5-day-old WT cells, we used a UV-pulsed laser to break the Q-nMT bundle into two pieces. In most cases, the length of both the released fragment and the fragment attached to the SPB remained constant, with the presence of dynamic cMTs after laser ablation testifying for cell viability (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3I</xref>, Sup. Fig. 3K). In contrast, as expected form previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Khodjakov et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">Zareiesfandabadi and Elting, 2022</xref>), in proliferating cells, dynamic anaphase spindles promptly disassembled after the laser-induced breakage (Sup. Fig. 3L). This indicates that once Q-nMT bundles are formed, they do not require MT-kinetochore interaction to be maintained. Accordingly, inactivation of Ndc80 (Sup <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>) or Ipl1 (Sup. Fig. 3M) in cells that are already in quiescence had no effect on the Q-nMT bundle maintenance. Thus, once formed, Q-nMT stability is established and maintained throughout its length.</p>

<title>Each phase of Q-nMT bundle formation requires specific kinesins</title>
<p>To further dissect the molecular mechanism of Q-nMT bundle formation, we focused on kinesins. Kar3 is a kinesin that, in complex with its regulator Cik1, can generate parallel MT bundles from a MT organizing center (MTOC) both <italic>in vitro</italic> and in proliferating cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Manning et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Mieck et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Molodtsov et al., 2016</xref>).

<p>Yeast have an additional kinesin-5 called Kip1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Fridman et al., 2013</xref>).

<title>SPB duplication/separation requires Q-nMT bundle disassembly</title>
<p>Finally, we questioned the molecular mechanism of Q-nMT bundle disassembly upon exit from quiescence.

Then we measured Q-nMT bundle thickness upon depolymerization, and found that while Q-nMT bundles shortened, they did not become thinner (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>). In agreement, Nuf2-GFP clusters found at the Q-nMT bundle +end moved back to the SPB while the Nuf2-GFP clusters localized along the Q-nMT bundle remained immobile until they are reached by the +end-associated clusters (Sup. Fig. 5A). This shows that not all MT +ends started depolymerizing at the same time, and that longer MTs depolymerized first. This finding is consistent with our model in which MTs are cross-linked along the entire length of the Q-nMT bundle.</p>

<p>Since Kip3 is the only well-characterized yeast MT depolymerase, we examined Q-nMT bundle disassembly in <italic>kip3Δ</italic> cells and found that it was drastically delayed (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>, Sup. Fig. 5B), yet the overall depolymerization rate remained unaffected (Sup. Fig. 5B, left panel). In fact, we found that in WT cells, Kip3 needs to be resynthesized upon exit from quiescence (Sup. Fig. 5C). We searched for proteins that might be involved in Q-nMT bundle disassembly together with Kip3. Among the proteins required for mitotic spindle disassembly, we found that inactivation of <italic>CDC14</italic>, <italic>CDC15</italic>, <italic>CDH1</italic>, <italic>DCC1,</italic> and <italic>TOR1</italic> had no effect on Q-nMT bundle disassembly, as did the inactivation of Ipl1 or proteins involved in kinetochore-MT attachment (Sup. Fig. 5D-G). The only additional actor we found was She1, a dynein regulator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Bergman et al., 2012</xref>), whose deletion strongly exacerbated the <italic>kip3Δ</italic> phenotype (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>, Sup. Fig. 5H). Thus, Q-nMT bundle disassembly does not rely on the canonical mitotic spindle disassembly machinery, but rather specifically requires Kip3 and She1.</p>
<p>Importantly, when we followed quiescence exit at the single cell level, depolymerization of the Q-nMT bundle always preceded SPB duplication/separation (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>), in both WT and in <italic>kip3Δ</italic> cells (Sup. Fig. 5B, right panel). When we severely impeded Q-nMT bundle disassembly using <italic>kip3Δ she1Δ</italic>, we found that SPB separation was greatly delayed (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D-F</xref>, Sup. Fig. 5I-K). Besides, the growth rate of <italic>kip3Δ she1Δ</italic> cells during proliferation is the same as WT cells (Sup. Fig. 5I), and upon quiescence exit, these mutant cells disassembled actin bodies as fast as WT cells (Sup. Fig. 5K), demonstrating that <italic>kip3Δ she1Δ</italic> cells were not impaired in sensing quiescence exit signals. These observations suggest that upon exit from quiescence, the Q-nMT bundle has to be disassembled prior to SPB duplication/separation.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our results shed light on the precise temporal sequences that generate a Q-nMT bundle upon quiescence establishment in yeast. From bacteria to human stem cells, changes in cell physicochemical properties are known to accompany the establishment of quiescence. Among these modifications, cellular volume reduction increases molecular crowding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Joyner et al., 2016</xref>), and pH acidification both increases viscosity and causes changes in macromolecule surface charges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Charruyer and Ghadially, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Jacquel et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Munder et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Persson et al., 2020</xref>). Much evidence suggests that these modifications act as triggers for the auto-assembly of several types of enzyme-containing granules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Munder et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Petrovska et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Rabouille and Alberti, 2017</xref>), or complex structures such as P-bodies and Proteasome Storage Granules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Peters et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Jacquel et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Currie et al., 2023</xref>). Recently, Molines and colleagues demonstrated that cytoplasmic viscosity modulates MT dynamics <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Molines et al., 2022</xref>). Here, we showed that the formation of the Q-nMT bundle does not depend on changes in the physicochemical properties that cells experience at the onset of quiescence establishment (Sup. Fig. 1). In fact, dynamic cMTs and a stable Q-nMT bundle can be observed simultaneously in a quiescent cell (Sup. Fig. 1I), while physicochemical properties evolve in parallel in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Joyner et al., 2016</xref>). Importantly, cellular volume reduction, pH acidification and increased viscosity are observed within minutes upon glucose starvation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Joyner et al., 2016</xref>) whereas the Q-nMT bundles require a couple of days to be fully assembled (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). Furthermore, Q-nMT bundle formation cannot be delayed in time (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1H</xref>), and thus likely depends on a transient signal emitted upon glucose depletion. We speculate that the SPB may act as a platform that integrates this signal, and transfers it to the MT machinery in order to assemble a stable MT structure.</p>
<p>As it is required for the onset of Q-nMT bundle formation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>), the CPC component Aurora B/Ilp1, a kinase that plays a key role at the MT-kinetochore interface in response to the tension status, could be one of the targets of the aforementioned nutritional signal. In parallel, upon quiescence establishment, chromosome hyper-condensation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Guidi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Rutledge et al., 2015</xref>) could modify the tension at the kinetochore/MT interface and, as such, could contribute to the initiation of phase I (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6b</xref>). Besides, Bim1 has also been implicated in MT-kinetochore attachment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Dudziak et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Akhmanova and Steinmetz, 2015</xref>). Although its deletion alone has no effect on Q-nMT bundle formation, its role becomes critical for phase I when kinetochore-MT interactions are already destabilized by the absence of other CPC components, other than Ipl1, such as Bir1 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>). Taken together, these observations suggest that kinetochore-MT interactions are essential for phase I initiation, as confirmed by the absence of Q-nMT bundle in the <italic>ndc80-1</italic> mutant (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>).</p>

<caption><title>Model for Q-nMT bundle assembly</title>
<p>(a) In G1, the nucleus is in a Rabl-like configuration. (b) Upon quiescence establishment, chromosomes get condensed. MT-kinetochore interaction and Ilp1 are required for the onset of phase I. (c) Kar3 and its regulator Cik1 are essential to initiate Q-nMT bundle elongation. Although deletion of <italic>BIM1</italic> has no effect, it becomes critical for phase I if kinetochore-MT interactions are destabilized by the absence of Chromosome Passenger Complex components. Kinetochore clustering by the monopolin complex and Slk19 is needed to maintain MT bundling while phase I MTs elongate. During phase I, Tub4 (ɣ-Tubulin) accumulates at the SPB. (d) In phase II, a second wave of MT nucleation and elongation occur. Phase II MTs are concurrently stabilized along pre-existing phase I MTs, in a Cin8-dependent manner. Phase I and phase II MT +ends (&gt;1 µm) remain dynamic until the full-length Q-nMT bundle stabilization is reached via the action of Kip1, about 2 days after glucose exhaustion (e).</p></caption>

</fig>
<p>In phase I, SPB-anchored MTs elongate and are concomitantly stabilized (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A-C</xref>). This step requires the kinesin-14 Kar3 and its regulator Cik1 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>). During mating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Molodtsov et al., 2016</xref>), and in early mitosis, when half-spindles form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Kornakov et al., 2020</xref>), Kar3/Cik1, together with Bim1, align and cross-link growing MTs along existing MTs, thereby promoting the organization of MTs into parallel bundles. In mitosis however, the kinesin-14/EB1 complex promotes MT dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Kornakov et al., 2020</xref>). It remains to be determined whether the robust MT stabilization in phase I depends on the modification of the kinesin-14/EB1 complex properties and/or on additional specific cross-linker(s) (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6c</xref>).</p>
<p>In quiescence, deletion of either Monopolin or <italic>SLK19</italic> results in the formation of short, shattered and flared MT structures, phenotypes that are exacerbated by the deletion of <italic>BIM1</italic> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3F-H</xref>). Since Monopolin and Slk19 are involved in kinetochore clustering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Plowman et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Rabitsch et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">Tóth et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Lee et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Mittal et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Movshovich et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Richmond et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">Zeng et al., 1999</xref>), we speculate that kinetochore-kinetochore interaction may not only help prevent depolymerization of individual MTs, but also constrain elongating phase I MTs and facilitate their concomitant cross-linking (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6d</xref>).</p>
<p>With the initiation of phase I, Tub4 begins to accumulate at the SPB to enable the second wave of MT nucleation observed in phase II. As phase II MTs elongate, they are simultaneously stabilized along pre-existing phase I MTs (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6d</xref>). This step relies on the kinesin-5/Cin8 as Q-nMT bundles assembled in <italic>cin8Δ</italic> cells are thinner than WT Q-nMT bundles (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C-E</xref>). Intriguingly, <italic>in vitro,</italic> the monomeric form of the vertebrate kinesin-5, Eg5, promotes MT nucleation and stabilizes lateral tubulin-tubulin contacts (Chen et al 2019). We assume that in the absence of Cin8, either nucleation of phase II MTs cannot occur, or phase II MTs can elongate, but cannot be cross-linked and stabilized to a pre-existing phase I MT(s) as they grow, and thus rapidly depolymerize. Absence of bundle thickening in phase II is also observed in the “<italic>Tub1-only</italic>” mutant <italic>i.e.</italic> in the absence of Tub3. Tubulin isotypes or tubulin PTMs are known to promote the recruitment of specific kinesins and thereby modify MT properties, see for example (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Sirajuddin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Peris et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Dunn et al., 2008</xref>). Could Tub3 be important for Cin8 recruitment or function during phase II?</p>
<p>Following phase II, MTs elongate, but their distal parts (&gt;1 µm) are not yet stable (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). Stabilization of full-length Q-nMT bundles is achieved approximately 4 days after glucose exhaustion. This step depends on the kinesin-5/Kip1 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4G-H</xref> and Sup. Fig. 4E) which is essential for cross-linking and stabilizing elongating MTs during phase III (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6e</xref>). Accordingly, we observed a Kip1 enrichment at the Q-nMT bundle +ends (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4F</xref>). Thus, consistent with their ability to form homo-tetramers capable of cross-linking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Acar et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Kapitein et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Scholey et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">Weinger et al., 2011</xref>) and stabilizing parallel MTs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Kapitein et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Shimamoto et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">Yukawa et al., 2020</xref>) in addition to their role of sliding anti-parallel MTs, the two yeast kinesins 5 are essential for Q-nMT bundle formation. However, in quiescence, as well as in mitosis, Kip1 and Cin8 have non-equivalent functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Roostalu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Shapira and Gheber, 2016</xref>).</p>
<p>Thus far, our results indicate that the mechanism of Q-nMT bundle formation is distinct from that of mitotic spindle assembly. Similarly, we show that Q-nMT bundle disassembly does not involve the same pathway as mitotic spindle disassembly as it involves Kip3 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>) but is independent of the anaphase-promoting complex and Aurora B/Ipl1 (Sup. Fig. 5D-G). Interestingly, the longest MTs begin to depolymerize from their +ends first. Then, when they reach the +ends of shorter MTs, the shorter ones proceed to depolymerize alongside them (Sup. Fig. 5A). This cooperative behavior has been observed <italic>in vitro</italic> within parallel MT bundles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Laan et al., 2008</xref>). Our data demonstrate that such a comportment does exist <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>
<p>Finally, our data indicate that the Q-nMT bundle is required for the survival of WT cells in quiescence. While we do not yet know why this structure is important for chronological aging, it is clear that the presence of the Q-nMT bundle modifies the organization of the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Laporte et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Laporte and Sagot, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Laporte et al., 2016</xref>). Since chromatin organization influences gene expression, one hypothesis could be that the presence of the Q-nMT bundle is required for the expression of genes necessary for cell survival in quiescence. Another attractive hypothesis is that the Q-nMT bundle could be the yeast analog of the mammalian primary cilium. Indeed, these two structures are formed upon proliferation cessation, they are both composed of highly stable parallel MTs, their formation involves MT motors, and they are both templated from the centriole/SPB. More importantly, we show here that Q-nMT disassembly is required to allow SPB separation upon exit from quiescence (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>). Thus, the Q-nMT bundle disassembly may control reentry into the proliferation cycle, just as the primary cilium does in ciliated mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Goto et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Kim and Tsiokas, 2011</xref>).</p>

Fig. 3K-L) was performed at room temperature with a 100X oil Plan-Apochromat objective lens (NA 1.4) and an Axio-Observed.Z1 microscope (Carl Zeiss) equipped with a spinning disk confocal (Yokogawa), an EMCCD Evolve camera (Photometrics and Roper Scientific) and 491 nm (100 mW; Cobolt calypso) and 561 nm (100 mW; Cobolt Jive) lasers. Images were acquired with Metamorph software (Roper Scientific). Every 30 to 120 s, a Z-series of 0.4 µm steps were acquired. A 355 nm microchip laser (Teem Photonics) with a 21 kHz repetition rate, 0.8 µJ energy/pulse, 2 kW of peak power and 400 ps pulse width, powered with an iLas2 PULSE system (Roper Scientific) was used between 10 to 40 % power with one pulse of a spot length of 100 points. Breakage was considered as successful if a non-alignment between the two remaining Q-n MT bundle fragments was observed.</p>
<p>In <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.1H, F</xref>; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B-C</xref>; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig.3C</xref>; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D, G</xref>; Sup. Fig. 1I; Sup. Fig. 2E and Sup. Fig. 3A, a faint and fuzzy fluorescence signal was detected in some cell cytoplasm using the GFP filter set. This signal is not GFP but rather due to a non-specific yellow background fluorescence.</p>
<p>Z-stacks were deconvolved using the Deconvolution Lab plugin (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D, F</xref>; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 C, E-F</xref> <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A, F</xref>; Sup. Fig. 1E; Sup. Fig. 2A and Sup. Fig. 4B).</p>

<title>Image analysis</title>
<p>Distribution and associated statistics were performed using GraphPad Prism 5 (GraphPad Software, Inc. La Jolla, USA) and Excel (Microsoft). Unless specified, a student test (t-test with two independent samples) was used to compare two conditions. Among p-values obtained from biological repetitions in a same experiment (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.1A</xref>; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 B-C</xref>; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D, F, H</xref>; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 C, H</xref>, and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>), the indicated p-values are the highest measured among repeated experiments. P-values above 0.05 are indicated, while values below are depicted with ** (0.05&gt;p-value&gt;1.10<sup>−4</sup>) and *** if p-value is less than 1.10<sup>−5</sup> Histograms and scatter dot plots show the mean and the error bars indicate SD. MT length was measured on MAX-projected images using image-J.</p>
<p>For MT fluorescence intensity measurements (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref>) a line scan (i1) of 4 pixels width containing both FP signal and background was drawn along MTs on SUM projection images (4 z-plans) using ImageJ. A line of 8 pixels width (at the same location) was drawn in order to calculate the intensity of the surrounding background (i2). The real intensity (ir) was calculated as follow: int = [i1 - ([(i2 x i2<sub>surface</sub>) - (i1 x i1<sub>surface</sub>)] / (i2<sub>surface</sub> - i1<sub>surface</sub>)) * i1<sub>surface</sub>]. We arbitrarily set the ‘zero’ at 0,5µm before the fluorescence increased onset on the SPB side in order to align all intensity measurements.</p>
<p>A similar approach was conducted to measure Tub4 fluorescence intensity (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>, Sup. Fig. 1F) <italic>i.e.</italic> (i1) and (i2) were two boxes, the second including the first one. Intensity was calculated as follow: int = [i1 - ([(i2 x i2<sub>surface</sub>) - (i1 x i1<sub>surface</sub>)] / (i2<sub>surface</sub> - i1<sub>surface</sub>)) * i1<sub>surface</sub>].</p>
<p>For morphometric Q-nMT bundle property distribution (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4B</xref>) the mean fluorescence intensity was measured in each individual cell, in a finite area localized adjacent to the SPB (0,4 µm – 3-4 Z stack sum projected) as an estimate of Q-nMT bundle width and plotted as a function of the according measured bundle length.</p>
<p>For Nuf2-GFP fluorescence intensity measurement at the SPB (Sup. Fig. 1E, bottom panel), GFP and RFP line scan measurements were done on a 4 Z-planes sum projection. The “SPB localization zone” was defined as the length ending 250 µm after the brightest RFP signal of Spc42-RFP. The remaining Q-nMT bundle zone was defined as the “+end zone”. The total Nuf2-GFP signal detected along the Q-nMT bundle was set to 100 % to determine the percentage of the signal measured at the “SPB localization zone” and the “+end zone”.</p>
<p>Normalized Q-nMT bundle length (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>) was done after line scan intensity measurements. mTQZ-Tub1 intensity slopes were first aligned on their inflexion points. To compare Q-nMT bundles with different lengths, we first sorted Q-nMT bundles &lt;1.8 µm. After an artificial isotropic expansion, we fit all MT structures to length order. Then, the corresponding mean intensity of the Q-nMT bundle (mTZQ-Tub1) and GFP signal were calculated.</p>
<p>To measure Q-nMT bundle depolymerization (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref> and Sup. Fig. 5B), individual Q-nMT bundle lengths were measured over time. The first length measurement was set to 100%. A fluorescence drop above or equal to 25 % defines the inflexion point of the slope, and was used to align the length measurements of different Q-nMT.</p>
<p>The FWHM (Full Width at Half Maximum, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>) was calculated by measuring fluorescence intensity of a line crossing perpendicularly to a Q-nMT bundle at 0.5 µm from the SPB, using a sum projection. After fitting the intensity level with a Gaussian distribution and obtaining the standard deviation (σ) value, FWHM was calculated using the equation 2√(2ln2)xσ.</p>

<title>Phenotypical analysis of cells without Q-nMT bundle</title>
<p>WT strains were grown to glucose exhaustion (OD ∼6.5, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F</xref>) or to 5 d (Sup. Fig. 1L), washed-out with “old YPDA” (YPDA medium in which cells were grown for 4 d and then filtered to remove cells) pulsed with either DMSO alone or DMSO containing Noc (30 µg/mL final concentration) for 24 h. Cells were then washed twice in “old YPDA” before being incubated in the same medium. Dead cell measurement was done using methylene blue staining. The capacity of cells to exit quiescence (Sup. Fig. 1L, right panel) was scored after micro-manipulation of live cells (cells not stained with methylene blue) as described in (Laporte et al., 2011).</p>

<p><bold>(A)</bold> Fluorescence intensity along MT structures in WT cells expressing mTQZ-Tub1. Mean intensity measurement for half pre-anaphase mitotic spindles (violet, n = 60), phase I (green, n = 19), and phase II (orange, n= 22) Q-nMT bundles. A line scan along the MT structure for an individual cell is shown as thin line, the mean as a bold line, all the lines being aligned at 0,5 µm before the fluorescence intensity increase onset on the SPB side.</p>
<p><bold>(B)</bold> Individual Q-nMT bundle full width measured at half-maximum in WT cells (4 d) expressing mTQZ-Tub1 before or after 1 h after Noc treatment. A paired t-test was use to compare the two conditions (n &gt; 40).</p>
<p><bold>(C)</bold> Nuclear MT length in WT haploid (mat a and mat α) or diploid (mat a/mat α) cells expressing mTQZ-Tub1. Each circle represents an individual cell. Mean and SD are shown in red.</p>
<p><bold>(D)</bold> Nuclear MT length in WT proliferating cells expressing mTQZ-Tub1 transferred to water, treated (<bold>+</bold>) or not (<bold>-</bold>) 15 min with 30 µg/ml Noc. Image of representative cells are shown, bar is 2 µm.</p>
<p><bold>(E)</bold> WT cells expressing Spc42-RFP (red) and mTQZ-Tub1 (green, top panel) or Nuf2-GFP (green, bottom panel) upon entry into quiescence. The percentages indicate the relative amount of Nuf2-GFP detected at the SBP (blue arrowhead), bar is 1 µm.</p>
<p><bold>(F)</bold> Tub4-mTQZ fluorescence intensity in WT cells of the W303 background. The mean and SD are shown; t-test was used to compare independent samples (N = 3, n &gt; 150), ***: p-value &lt; 1.10<sup>−5</sup>.</p>
<p><bold>(G)</bold> Fluorescence intensities in WT cells (4 d) expressing Tub4-mTQZ and mRuby-Tub1. The Tub4-mTQZ signal at the SBP is plotted as a function of the mRuby signal along the Q-nMT bundle. Each circle represents an individual cell (n = 60).</p>
<p><bold>(H) Top panel:</bold> western blot using anti-GFP and anti-RFP antibodies on total protein extracts obtained from the indicated cells upon entry into quiescence. Anti-Ade13 antibodies are used as loading control. <bold>Bottom panel</bold>: images of representative WT cells expressing only pTUB1-mTQZ-Tub1 (green) or only pADH2-mRuby-Tub1 (red) upon entry into quiescence as a control of cross channel fluorescence, bar is 2 µm.</p>

<p><bold>(J)</bold> An artificial fluid phase to solid-like transition in proliferating cells does not induce MT stabilization. Proliferating WT cells expressing mTQZ-Tub1 (green) and Spc42-RFP (red) with fluid (pH = 7.5) or solid-like (pH = 4) cytoplasm/nucleoplasm (see materials and method) were incubated 15 min with 30 µg/ml Noc (left) or stained with phalloidin to detect actin (right). Indicated phenotypes were quantified (left and right graphs, N = 2, n &gt; 115, mean and SD are indicated). Bar is 2 µm.</p>
<p><bold>(K)</bold> Cells can assemble dynamic cMTs (red arrowhead) in quiescence. 2-day-old WT cells expressing mRuby-Tub1 were imaged after a 15 min Noc pulse-chase (30 µg/ml, time is in min). Red arrowhead: cytoplasmic MT, blue arrowhead: SBP, bar is 2 µm.</p>
<p><bold>(L) Left graphs:</bold> WT cell viability after a 24h-pulse (grey rectangle) with Noc (30 µg/ml, circles) or DMSO (triangles), followed by a chase using carbon exhausted medium, the Noc pulse being done either upon glucose exhaustion or 5 days after glucose exhaustion. Each circle/triangle is the percentage obtained for an independent experiment in which n &gt; 200 cells were scored. <bold>Right graph:</bold> live cells, as attested by a clear staining after a methylene blue treatment, were micro-separated 8 days after the Noc pulse done either upon glucose exhaustion or 5 d after glucose exhaustion, and allowed to give rise to a colony on a YPDA plate. Each circle/triangle is the percentage obtained for an independent experiment in which n &gt; 100 cells were micro-separated. Images of representative YPDA plates after 3 d of growth at 30°C are shown. In E and K, blue arrowhead points to the SBP.</p>

<p>This work presents <bold>important</bold> insights regarding the mechanism underlying the assembly, maintenance, and disassembly of a very stable microtubule-based structure, termed quiescent-cell nuclear microtubule (Q-nMT) bundle, which is formed in quiescent yeast cells to ensure cell survival and viability. This insight will help to elucidate how very stable microtubules can exist alongside very dynamic microtubules, which is still poorly understood. While the experimental support is overall <bold>solid</bold>, additional analyses using state-of-the-art methodology would further strengthen some of the claims.</p>

<p>In their manuscript, Laporte et al. analyze the process of formation of the quiescent-cell nuclear microtubule (Q-nMT) bundle, a set of parallel MTs that emanate from the nuclear side of the spindle pole bodies (SPBs) upon the entry of Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells in quiescence. Based on their results, the authors propose that Q-nMT bundle formation is a multistep process that comprises three distinct sequential phases. The authors further evaluate the role of different factors during the growth of the Q-nMT bundle upon quiescence entry, as well as during the disassembly of this structure once the cells resume their proliferation.</p>
<p>The Q-nMT is an interesting cellular structure whose physiological function is still widely unknown. Hence, providing new insights into the dynamics of Q-nMT bundle formation and identifying new factors involved in this process is an interesting topic of relevance in the field. The authors made a substantial effort in order to evaluate Q-nMT bundle establishment and provide a considerable amount of data, mainly obtained from microscopy analyses. Overall, the experiments are mostly well described and properly executed, and the data in the manuscript are clearly presented. Despite the interest of the study, nonetheless, there are several issues that could affect the validity of some conclusions drawn. In this way, regarding the analysis of the dynamics of Q-nMT bundle formation, the described experimental setup raises certain concerns, which mostly derive from the use of the microtubule-depolymerizing agent nocodazole as the only approach to evaluate this process. Also, regarding the factors involved in Q-nMT formation, the differences in microtubule length with the wild type strain, despite being statistically significant, are really subtle for many of the mutants analyzed (e.g., bir1, slk19, etc.). Furthermore, it is also puzzling that an effect on Q-nMT formation is proposed for meiosis-specific factors such as Mam1, which might as well be present during quiescence, but seems to be also detected in proliferating cells. Lastly, the evidence shown are insufficient to provide a direct link between defects in cell viability and aberrant Q-nMT formation.</p>

<p>Summary: The authors investigate the assembly of the Q-nMT, a stable microtubule structure that is assembled during quiescence. Notably, the authors show that the formation of the Q-nMT cannot be solely explained by changes in the physico-chemical properties of quiescent cells. The authors report that Q-nMT assembly occurs in three regulated steps and identify kinesin motor proteins involved in the assembly and disassembly of the structure.</p>
<p>Strengths: The findings provide new insight into the assembly and possible function of the Q-nMT with respect to the response of haploid budding yeast to glucose starvation.</p>
<p>Weaknesses: The manuscript would benefit from more precise language and requires additional clarification regarding how claims are supported by the evidence. Clear definitions are also required, for example &quot;active process&quot; is not defined. Some conclusions are not supported by the results, for example the claim that the Q-nMT functions as a checkpoint effector that inhibits re-entry into the cell cycle.</p>
<p>After reviewing the responses of the authors and the revised manuscript I am now satisfied with the study in its current form.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>To hopefully contribute to more strongly support the conclusions of the manuscript, I am including a series of concerns regarding the experiments, as well as some recommendations that could be followed to address these issues:</p>
<p>(1) The Q-nMT bundle is largely unaffected by the nocodazole treatment in most phases during its formation. However, cells were only treated with nocodazole for a very short period of time (15 min). Have the authors analyzed Q-nMT stability after longer nocodazole exposures? Is a similar treatment enough to depolymerize the mitotic spindle? This result could be further substantiated by treatment with other MT-depolymerizing agents. Furthermore, the dynamicity of the Q-nMT bundle could be ideally also assessed by other techniques, such as FRAP.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The experiments suggested by the reviewer have been published in our previous paper (Laporte et al, JCB 2013). In this previous study, we presented data demonstrating the resistance of the Q-nMT bundle to several MT poisons: TBZ, benomyl, MBC (Sup Fig 2D) and to an increasing amount of nocodazole after a 90 min treatment (Sup Fig2E). These published figures are provided below.</p>

<p>(2) The graph in Figure 1B is somewhat confusing. Is the X-axis really displaying the length of the MTs as stated in the legend? If so, one would expect to see a displacement of the average MT length of the population as cells progress from phase II to phase III, as previously demonstrated in Figure 1A. Likewise, no data points would be anticipated for those phases in which the MT length is 0 or close to 0. Moreover, when the length of half pre-anaphase mitotic spindle was measured as a control, how can one get MT lengths that are equal or close to 0 in these cells? The length of the pre-anaphase spindle is between 2-4 um, so MT length values should range from 1 to 2 um if half the spindle is measured.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The graph in Fig1B represents the fluorescence intensity (a proxy for the Q-nMT bundle thickness) along the Q-nMT bundle length.</p>
<p>Fluorescence intensity is measured along a “virtual line” that starts 0,5 µm before the extremity of the QnMT bundle that is in contact with the SPB. In other words, we aligned all intensity measurements at the fluorescence increasing onset on the SPB side. We arbitrarily set the ‘zero’ at 0,5um before the fluorescence increased onset. That is why the fluorescence intensity is zero between 0 and 0,5 µm –  The X-axis represents this virtual line, the 0 being set 0,5 µm before the Q-nMT bundle extremity on the SPB side. This virtual line allows us to standardize our “thickness” measurements for all Q-nMT bundles.</p>
<p>Using this standardization, it is clear that the length of the Q-nMT bundles increased from phase II to III (see the red arrow). Yet, as in phase II, Q-nMT bundles are not yet stable, their lengths are shorter in phase II than in phase II after a Noc treatment (compare the end of the orange line and the end of the blue line in phase II).</p>

<p>This is now explained in details in the Material and Methods section (line 539-545).</p>
<p>This is the same for the inset of Fig 1B and in Sup Fig 1A, in which we measured fluorescence intensity along the halfmitotic spindle just as we did for MT bundle. The X-axis represent a virtual line along the mitotic spindle, starting 0,5 µm before the SBP spindle extremity.</p>

<p>(3) Microtubules seem to locate next to or to extend beyond the nucleus in the control cells (DMSO) in Figure 1H. Since both nuclear MTs and cytoplasmic MTs emanate from the SPBs, it would have been desirable to display the morphology of the nucleus when possible. Moreover, since the nucleus is a tridimensional structure, it would also be advisable to image different Z-sections.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Analysis demonstrating that Q-nMT bundles are located inside the nucleus have been provided in our previous paper (Laporte et al, JCB 2013). In this article most of the images are maximal projections of Z-stacks in which the nuclear envelope is visualized via Nup2-RFP (see Fig1 of Laporte et al, JCB 2013 as an example below).</p>

<p>(4) Movies depicting the process of Q-nMT bundle formation in live cells would have been really informative to more precisely evaluate the MT dynamics. Likewise, together with still images (Fig 1D and Supp. Fig. 1D), movies depicting the changes in the localization of Nuf2-GFP would have further facilitated the analysis of this process.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In a new Sup Fig 1E, we now provide images of Q-nMT bundle formation initiation in phase I, in which it can be observed that Nuf2-GFP accompanies the growth of MT (mTQZ-TUB1) at the onset of Q-nMT bundle formation. Unfortunately, it is technically very challenging to follow the entire process of Q-nMT bundle formation in individual cells, as it takes &gt; 48h. Indeed, for movies longer than 24h, on both microscope pads or specific microfluidic devices (Jacquel, et al, eLife 2021), phototoxicity and oxygen availability become problematic and affect cells’ viability.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) Western blot images displaying the relative protein levels for mTQZ-Tub1 and of the ADH2 promoter-driven mRuby-Tub1 at the different time points should be included to more strongly support the conclusion that new tubulin molecules are introduced in the Q-nMT bundle only after phase I. It is worth noting, in this sense, that the percentage of cells with 2 colors Q-nMT bundle is analyzed only 1 hour after expression of mRuby-Tub1 was induced for phase I cells, but after 24 hours for phase II cells.</p>
<p>
We have modified Fig 1F and now provide images of cells after 3, 6 and 24h after glucose exhaustion and the corresponding percentage of cells displaying Q-nMT bundle with the two colors. We also now provide a western blot in Sup Fig 1H using specific antibodies against mTQZ (anti-GFP) and mRuby (anti-RFP).</p>
<p>(6) In order to demonstrate that Q-nMT formation is an active process induced by a transient signal and that the Q-nMT bundle is required for cell survival, the authors treated cells with nocodazole for 24 h (Fig 1H and Supp Fig 1K). Both events, however, could be associated with the toxic effects of the extremely prolonged nocodazole treatment leading to cell death.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have treated 5 days old cells for 24h with 30 µg/ml Noc. We then washed the drug and transferred the cells into a glucose free medium. We then followed both cell survival, using methylene blue, and the cell’s capacity to form a colony after refeeding. In these conditions, we did not observe any toxic effect of the nocodazole. This result is now provided in Sup Fig 1L and discussed line 172-176.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(7) The &quot;Tub1-only&quot; mutant displays shorter but stable Q-nMT bundles in phase II, although they are thinner than in wild-type cells. What happens in the &quot;Tub3-only&quot; mutant, which also has beta-tubulin levels similar to wild-type cells (Supp. Fig. 2B)?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In order to measure Q-nMT bundle length and thickness, we used Tub1 fused to GFP. This cannot be done in a Tub3-only mutant. Yet, we have measured Q-nMT bundle length in Tub3-only cells using Bim1-3GFP as a MT marker (as in Laporte et al, JCB 2013). As shown in the figure below, Q-nMT bundles were shorter in Tub3-only cells than in WT cells whatever the phase.</p>

<p>We do not know if this effect is directly linked to the absence of Tub1 or if it is very indirect and for example due to the fact that Tub1 and Tub3 interact differently with Bim1 or other proteins that are involved in Q-nMT bundle stabilization. As we cannot give a clear interpretation for that result, we decided not to present those data in our manuscript.</p>

<p>(8) Why were wild-type and ndc80-1 cells imaged after a 20 min nocodazole treatment to evaluate the role of KT-MT attachments in Q-nMT bundle formation (Fig 3A)? Importantly, this experiment is also missing a control in which Q-nMT length is analyzed in both wild-type and ndc80-1 cells at 25ºC instead of 37ºC.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In this experiment, we used nocodazole to test both the formation and the stability of the Q-nMT bundle. Fig 3A shows MT length distribution in WT (grey) and ndc80-1 (violet) cells expressing mTQZTub1 (green) and Nuf2-GFP (red), shifted to 37 °C at the onset of glucose exhaustion and kept at this non-permissive temperature for 12 or 96 h then treated with Noc. The control experiment was provided in Sup Fig 3B. Indeed, this figure shows MT length in WT (grey) and ndc80-1 (violet) expressing mTQZ-Tub1 (green) and Nuf2-GFP (red) grown for 4 d (96h) at 25 °C, and treated or not with Noc. This is now indicated in the text line 216 and in the figure legend line 976</p>

<p>(9) As a general comment linked to the previous concern, it is striking that in many instances, Q-nMT bundle length is measured after nocodazole treatment without any evident reason to do this and without displaying the results in untreated cells as a control. If nocodazole is used, the authors should explicitly indicate it and state the reason for it.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We provide control experiments without nocodazole for all of the figures. For the sake of figure clarity, for Fig.3A the control without the drug is in Sup. Fig. 3B, for Fig. 3B it is shown in Sup. Fig. 3D, for Fig. 4B, it is shown in Sup. Fig 4A. This is now stated in the text and in the figure legend: for Fig. 3A: line 216 and in the figure legend line 976; for Fig. 3B: line 222 and figure legend line 984; for Fig. 4B: line 280 and in the figure legend line 1017.</p>
<p>The only figures where the untreated cells are not shown is for Fig 1D since the goal of the experiment is to make dynamic MTs shorten.</p>
<p>In Fig. 5C and Sup. Fig. 5D to F, we used nocodazole to get rid of dynamic cytoplasmic MTs that form upon quiescence exit in order to facilitate Q-nMT bundle measurement. This was explained in our previous study (Laporte et al, JCB 2013). We now mention it in the figure legends, see for example Fig. 5 legend line 1054.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(10) Ipl1 inactivation using the ipl1-1 thermosensitive allele impedes Q-nMT bundle formation. The inhibitor-sensitive ipl1-as1 allele could have been further used to show whether this depends on its kinase activity, also avoiding the need to increase the temperature, which affects MT dynamics.  As suggested, we have used the ipl1-5as allele. We have thus modified Fig 3B and now show that is it indeed the Ipl1 kinase activity that is required for Q-nMT bundle formation initiation (line 222).
In any case, it is surprising that deletion of SLI15 does not affect Q-nMT formation (in fact, MT length is even larger), despite the fact that Sli15, which localizes and activates Ipl1, is present at the Q-nMT (Fig 3C). Likewise, deletion of BIR1 has barely any effect on MT length after 4 days in quiescence (Fig 3D). Do the previous observations mean that Ipl1 role is CPC-independent? Does the lack of Sli15 or Bir1 aggravate the defect in Q-nMT formation of ipl1-1 cells at non-permissive or semi-permissive temperature?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks to the Reviewer’s comments, we have re-checked our sli15Δ strain and found that it was accumulating suppressors very rapidly. To circumvent this problem, we utilized the previously described sli15-3 strain (Kim et al, JCB 1999). We found that sli15-3 was synthetic lethal with both ipl1-1, ipl1-2 (as described in Kim et al, JCB 1999) and with ipl1-as5, preventing us from addressing the CPC dependence of the Ipl1 effect asked by the Reviewer. However, using the sli15-3 strain, we now show that inactivation of Sli15 upon glucose exhaustion does prevent Q-nMT bundle formation (See new Sup Fig 3F and the text line 226-227).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(11) Lack of both Bir1 and Bim1 act in a synergistic way with regard to the defect in Q-nMT bundle formation. Although the absence of both Sli15 and Bim1 is proposed to lead to a similar defect, this is not sustained by the data provided, particularly in the absence of nocodazole treatment (Supp. Fig 3E).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Deletion of bir1 alone has only a subtle effect on Q-nMT bundle length in the absence of Noc, yet in bir1Δ cells, Q-nMT bundles are sensitive to Noc. Deletion of BIM1 (bim1Δ) aggravates this phenotype (Fig. 3D). As mentioned above, Q-nMT bundle formation is impaired in sli15-3 cells. In our hands, and as expected from (Zimnaik et al, Cur Biol 2012), this allele is synthetic lethal with bim1Δ.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>On the other hand, the simultaneous lack of Bir1 and Bim1 drastically reduces the viability of cells in quiescence and this is proposed to be evidence supporting that KT-MT attachments are critical for QnMT bundle assembly (Supp Fig 3G). However, similarly to what was indicated previously for the 24 h nocodazole treatment, here again, the lack of viability could be originated by other reasons that are associated with the lack of Bir1 and Bim1 and not necessarily with problems in Q-nMT formation. In fact, the viability defect of cells lacking Bir1 and Bim1 is similar to that of cells only lacking Bir1 (Supp Fig 3G).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have previously shown that many mutants impaired for Q-nMT bundle formation (dyn1Δ, nip100Δ etc) have a reduced viability in quiescence (Laporte et al, JCB 2013). In the current study, a very strong phenotype is observed for other mutants impaired for Q-nMT bundle formation such as bim1Δ bir1Δ cells, but also for slk19Δ bim1Δ.</p>
<p>Importantly, as shown in the new Sup Fig 1L, in WT cells treated with Noc upon entry into quiescence, a treatment that prevents Q-nMT formation, showed a reduced viability, while a Noc treatment that does not affect Q-nMT bundle formation, i.e. a treatment in late quiescence, has no effect on cell survival. This solid set of data point to a clear correlation between the ability of cells to assemble a Q-nMT bundle and their ability to survive in quiescence. Yet, of course, we cannot formally exclude that in all these mutants, the reduction of cell viability in quiescence is due to another reason.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(12) Both Mam1 and Spo13 are, to my knowledge, meiosis-specific proteins. It is therefore surprising that mutants in these proteins have an effect on MT bundle formation (Fig 3G-H, Supp. Fig. 3G). Are Mam1 and Spo13 also expressed during quiescence? Transcription of MAM1 or SPO13 does not seem to be induced by glucose depletion in previously published microarray experiments, but if Mam1 are Spo13 are expressed in quiescent cells, the authors should show this together with their results.</p>
<p>
Indeed, it is interesting to notice that Mam1 and Spo13 are involved in both meiosis and Q-nMT bundle formation. As suggested by the Reviewer we have performed western blots in order to address the expression of those proteins in proliferation and quiescence (4d). We tagged Spo13 with either GFP, HA or Myc but none of the fusion proteins were functional. Yet, as shown in the new Sup Fig 3I, Mam1-GFP, Csm1-GFP and Lsr4-GFP were expressed both in proliferation and quiescence.</p>
<p>(13) In the laser ablation experiments that demonstrate that KT-MT attachments are not needed in order to maintain Q-nMT bundles once formed, anaphase spindles of proliferating cells were cut as a control (Supp. Fig 3I). However, late anaphase cells have already segregated the chromosomes, which lie next to the SPBs (this can be evidenced by looking at Dad2-GFP localization in Supp. Fig 3I), so that only interpolar MTs are severed in these experiments. The authors should have instead used metaphase cells as a control, since chromosomes are maintained at the spindle midzone and the length and width of the metaphase spindle is more similar to that of the Q-nMT bundle.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have tried to “cut” short metaphase spindles, but as they are &lt; 1 µm, after the laser pulse, it is difficult to verify that spindles are indeed cut and not solely “bleached”. Furthermore, after the cut, the remaining MT structure that is detectable is very short, and we are not confident in our length measurements. Yet, this type of experiment has been done in S. pombe (Khodjakov et al, Cur Biol 2004 and Zareiesfandabadi et al, Biophys. J. 2022). In these articles the authors have demonstrated that after a cut, metaphase spindles are unstable and rapidly shrink through the action of Kinesin14 and dynein. This is now mentioned in the text line 265.</p>

<p>(14) In the experiment that shows that cycloheximide prevents Q-nMT disassembly after quiescence exit, and therefore that this process requires de novo protein synthesis (Fig. 5A), cells are indicated to express only Spc42-RFP and Nuf2-GFP. However, Stu2-GFP images are also shown next to the graph and, according to the figure legend, it was indeed Stu2-GFP that was used to measure individual QnMT bundles in cells treated with cycloheximide. In the graph, additionally, time t=0 represents the onset of MT bundle depolymerization, but Q-nMT bundle disassembly does not take place after cycloheximide treatment. The authors should clarify these aspects of the experiment.</p>

<p>(3) Besides the Q-nMT bundle, it is sometimes noticeable an additional strong cytoplasmic fluorescent signal in cells that express mTQZ-Tub1 and/or mRuby-Tub1 (e.g., Figs 1F, 1H and, particularly, Supp Fig 1H). What is the nature of these cytoplasmic MT structures?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We did mention this observation in the material and methods section (see line 526-528). This signal is a background fluorescence signal detected with our long pass GFP filter. It is not GFP as it is “yellowish” when we view it via the microscope oculars. This background signal can also be observed in quiescent WT cells that do not express any GFP. We do not know what molecule could be at the origin of that signal but it may be derivative of an adenylic metabolite that accumulates in quiescence and could be fluorescent in the 550nm –ish wavelength, but this is pure speculation.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) It is remarkable that a 20-30% decrease in tubulin levels had such a strong impact on the assembly of the Q-nMT bundle (Supp. Fig. 2). Can this phenotype be recovered by increasing the amount of tubulin in the mutants impaired for tubulin folding?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Yes, this is astonishing, but we believe our data are very solid since we observed that with both tub3Δ and in all the tubulin folding mutants we have tested (See Sup. Fig. 2). To answer Reviewer’s question, we would need to increase the amount of properly folded tubulin, in a tubulin folding mutant. One way to try to do that would be to find suppressors of GIM mutations, but this is a lengthy process that we feel would not add much strength to this conclusion.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) The graphs displaying the length of the Q-nMT bundle in several mutants in microtubule motors throughout a time course are presented in a different manner than in previous experiments, with data points for individual cells being only shown for the most extreme values (Fig 4C, 4H). It would be advisable, for the sake of comparison, to unify the way to represent the data.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>Yes, only viable cells were selected for the colony forming assay. We used methylene blue to stain dead cells. Then, we used a micromanipulation instrument (Singer Spore Play) that is commonly used for tetrad dissection to select “non blue cells” and position them on a plate (as we do with spores). Each micromanipulated cell is then allowed to grow on the plate and we count colonies (see picture in Sup Fig 1L right panel). This was described in Laporte et al, JCB 2011. We have added that piece of information in the legend (line 1129-1130) and in the M&amp;M section (line 580-586).</p>

<p>(2) Could Tub3 have a role in phase I? It is not clear why the authors conclude involvement only in phase II.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As it can be seen in Fig 2D, MT bundle length and thickness are quite similar in WT and Tub1-only cells in phase I, indicating that the absence of Tub3 as no effect in phase I. In Tub1-only cells, MT bundles are thinner in both phase II and phase III, yet, they get fully stabilized in phase III. Thus, the effect of Tub3 is largely specific to the nucleation/elongation of phase II MTs. We hope to have clarified that point in the text (line 203-207).</p>

<p>(3) Quantifications, statistics: for all quantifications, the authors should clearly state the number of experiments (replicates), and number of cells used in each, and what number was used for statistics.  For all quantifications in cells, it seems that the values from the total number of cells across different experiments were plotted and used for statistics. This is not very useful and results in extremely small p values. I assume that the values for individual cells were obtained from multiple, independent experiments. Unless there are technical limitations that allow only a very small sample size (not the case here for most experiments), for experiments involving treatments the authors should determine values for each experiment and show statistics for comparison between experiments rather than individual cells pooled from multiple experiments.</p>
