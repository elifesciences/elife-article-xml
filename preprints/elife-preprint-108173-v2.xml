<title>Introduction</title>
    <p>The nervous system contains a diverse ensemble of neuron types, which are generated during development in appropriate numbers under tightly controlled processes. A central question in developmental neurobiology concerns how diverse neuron types acquire unique cell identities with characteristic morphologies, distinct gene expression profiles and specific functionalities. <underline>K</underline>enyon <underline>c</underline>ells (KCs) are the intrinsic neurons in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> <underline>m</underline>ushroom <underline>b</underline>ody (MB) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>] and can serve as an excellent model system for investigations into the molecular mechanisms of neuron-type diversification. Around 2,000 KCs generated by four neuroblasts are grouped into three sequentially born types, including γ, α’/β’ and α/β neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>]. Functionally, these main KC types play different roles in short-term memory, acquisition, stabilization, and retrieval of memory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>]. Morphologically, both α/β and α’/β’ neurons have axons with two branches that project dorsally and medially into respective α and β, or α’ and β’ lobes, whereas γ neurons send out single axon branches that project medially into the γ lobe [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>]. These three types of KCs can be also distinguished by differentially expressed marker genes. For instance, <underline>b</underline>road-complex, tramtrack and <underline>b</underline>ric-ȧ-brac <underline>z</underline>i<underline>n</underline>c finger transcription factor (BTBzf TF) <underline>Ab</underline>rupt (Ab) is specifically expressed in γ neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>], whereas cell adhesion molecule Fasciclin II and Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor Trio are expressed in different subsets of KC types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>]. Therefore, specifying KC types with proper cell numbers, unique cell identities and distinct functions is a key aspect of MB formation.</p>
<p>Previous studies have revealed that the other BTBzf TF, <underline>Ch</underline>ronologically <underline>in</underline>appropriate <underline>mo</underline>rphogenesis (Chinmo), exhibits a graded expression pattern in KCs and plays a crucial role in diversifying main KC types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>]. Chinmo is highly expressed in early-born γ neurons, but its expression level is low in later-born α’/β’ and absent in α/β neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>]. Notably, Chinmo controls the expression of the third BTBzf TF, <underline>Ma</underline>ternal gene required for <underline>m</underline>ei<underline>o</underline>sis (Mamo), functioning to specify the identities of main KC types at the larval stage via a fine-tuning process. In particular, a high expression level of Chinmo inhibits Mamo expression in γ neurons, whereas low Chinmo expression promotes Mamo production in α’/β’ neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>]. As a gradual reduction of Chinmo expression occurs during development, Mamo, adding to its function in α’/β’ neurons, takes over Chinmo’s role of regulating the differentiation of γ neurons at the pupal stage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>]. In the absence of <italic>chinmo</italic> and <italic>mamo</italic>, molecular and morphological characteristics of γ and α’/β’ neurons are shifted towards those of α/β neurons, constituting a cell identity transformation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>]. Therefore, the late-born α/β neural identity is hypothesized to be a default status upon the loss of the neural identity determinants for early-born KCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>]. However, it is also possible that key specification regulators of α/β neurons exist but have not yet been identified.</p>
<p>In this study, we leverage RNA-seq databases on KCs to identify type-specific markers as readouts for the cell identity of γ, α’/β’ and α/β neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>]. By doing so, we identified a phylogenetically conserved Pipsqueak domain-containing TF, <underline>E</underline>cdysone-induced <underline>p</underline>rotein <underline>93</underline>F (<underline>E</underline>ip<underline>93</underline>F/E93), with preferential expression in α/β neurons. Loss-of-function of <italic>E93</italic> not only downregulated α/β-specific gene expression, including a subunit of T-type like voltage gated calcium channel Ca-α1T, but it also upregulated γ-specific Ab in late-born KCs, implying that an identity shift towards early-born KCs had occurred. Intriguingly, RNAi knockdown of <italic>E93</italic> or <italic>Ca</italic>-α<italic>1T</italic> in α/β neurons further compromised animal behaviors, including foraging-related and night-time activities. In contrast, E93 overexpression precociously turned on Ca-α1T expression in early-born KCs at the expense of abolishing expression of early-born KC markers, such as Ab and Mamo. Notably, E93 was upregulated in early-born KCs in the absence of <italic>chinmo</italic> and <italic>mamo</italic> but diminished in late-born KCs upon Ab overexpression. Taken together, our results suggest that a hierarchical genetic network among <italic>chinmo</italic>, <italic>mamo</italic>, <italic>E93</italic> and <italic>ab</italic> with potential feedback loops controls the identity and function of main KC types during the construction of functional MBs.</p>

<title>Identification of KC-type specific markers</title>
<p>By leveraging information from published RNA-seq studies showing preferentially expressed genes in adult KC types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>], we sought to identify a collection of KC-type specific marker lines (available at stock centers) with GFP transgenes at genes of interest [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>]. The results of this screen for KC marker GFP lines are depicted in S1 Fig and Supplemental table 1; highlights of certain KC-type specific marker lines are described below. First, <underline>Ab</underline>rupt (Ab)-GFP, a BAC clone-engineered GFP line, can be used to replace an excellent Ab antibody (generated by Dr. Crews laboratory but no longer available) for labeling γ neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>] (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A-B</xref> and S2 Fig). In addition, <underline>Lac</underline>hesin (Lac; an Ig superfamily protein[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>])-FSVS, a GFP-trapping line, expresses GFP-fused Lac specifically in α’/β’ neurons starting from the early pupal stage (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1C-D</xref> and S3A Fig). Notably, we also identified two other GFP-trapping lines, <underline>E</underline>cdysone-induced <underline>p</underline>rotein <underline>93</underline>F (E93)-GFSTF and <underline>Ca</underline>lcium channel protein <underline>α1</underline> subunit <underline>T</underline> (Ca-α1T)-GFSTF, that express GFP-fused proteins enriched in α/β neurons. Enrichment in these neurons is evidenced by patterns of complementary expression to Trio, a marker of γ and α’/β’ neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>] (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1E-H</xref>). Consistent with the notion that generation of most of α/β neurons occurs at the pupal stage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>], E93-GFSTF and Ca-α1T-GFSTF were not detectable in KCs at the wandering larval (WL) stage (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">1G</xref> and S3B Fig). With this set of useful reagents, we set out to further explore the molecular mechanisms underlying cell identity specification of main KC types.</p>

<caption><title>Expression patterns of main KC type markers</title>
<p>(A-H) KC type-specific GFP markers (green) were counter-stained with Trio (magenta) to reveal expression patterns at the wandering larval (WL) (A, C, E and G) and adult (B, D, F and H) stages. (A-B) Ab-GFP was primarily expressed in cell bodies of γ neurons at both WL and adult stages. The Trio signal indicates locations of γ neurons for staining observed only in cytosol (arrows) and α’/β’ neurons for staining in the entire cell (arrowheads). (C-D) Lac-FSVS expression was enriched in α’ and β’ lobes (arrowheads) of adult but not WL stage animals. The single section in the bottom panels of <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref> reveal the lack of Lac-FSVS expression in the γ lobe. (E-H) E93-GFSTF and Ca-α1T-GFSTF were preferentially expressed in respective cell bodies and dendrites (the calyx) of α/β neurons (double-arrows) at adult but not WL stage animals. In addition to calyx expression, Ca-α1T-GFSTF was also seen in the protocerebral bridge (PB) of adult brains. Genotypes shown in all figures are summarized in Supplementary Table 2.

<title>Loss-of-function of <italic>E93</italic> suppresses the <bold>α</bold>/<bold>β</bold>-neural identity and has behavioral consequences</title>
<p>Since E93, a Pipsqueak-domain containing TF, functions crucially in various biological processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>] and E93-GFSTF was preferentially expressed in α/β neurons (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1F</xref>), we sought to investigate whether <italic>E93</italic> acts as a critical regulator for specifying the α/β-neural identity. First, we found that the expression of a α/β-specific marker, Ca-α1T-GFSTF, was diminished in the context of <italic>E93</italic> mutation (<italic>E93</italic><sup>Δ<italic>11</italic></sup>) and in a line with <italic>E93</italic> knockdown due to overexpression of <italic>E93</italic> RNAi by a pan-KC driver, GAL4-OK107[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>] (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A-B</xref> and S4-S5 Fig). In contrast, the same RNAi knockdown elicited no discernible effects on the expression levels of Trio and Lac-FSVS in γ and α’/β’ neurons (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A-B</xref> and S6 Fig). In addition to the observed reduction of Ca-α1T-GFSTF, <italic>E93</italic> knockdown in KCs substantially compromised the expression of another α/β-specific marker, myr::GFP driven by 44E04-LexA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>] (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2C-D</xref>). Although these results seemed to indicate the loss of α/β neural identity due to loss of <italic>E93</italic> function, the findings also raised a possibility that the reduction of Ca-α1T-GFSTF and 44E04-LexA might simply be due to the absence of late-born KCs. However, this explanation was ruled out by the observation of relatively intact morphology of α and β lobes when we examined the expression of a third α/β-specific marker (myr::GFP driven by 70F05-LexA) upon <italic>E93</italic> knockdown in KCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>] (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2E-F</xref>). Moreover, compared to wild-type samples, the cell number of 70F05-LexA-positive neurons was not significantly altered in KCs when <italic>E93</italic> was knocked down (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2G-H</xref> and S7 Fig). Taking advantage of 70F05-LexA as a putative α/β-neural marker, we further found that more than half of the 70F05-LexA-positive neurons ectopically expressed γ-specific Ab-GFP in <italic>E93</italic> knockdown samples (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2G-H</xref> and S7 Fig), implying that α/β neurons had transformed into γ-like neurons. These results taken together suggested that E93, despite of unable to direct axon morphogenesis, is required for specifying KCs towards the cell identity of α/β neurons by regulating the expression of certain α/β-specific genes.</p>

<caption><title>E93 specifies the α/β neural identity and affects animal behaviors</title>
<p>As compared to the wild-type controls (A and C), flies with overexpression of <italic>E93</italic> RNAi (B and D) by a pan-KC driver, GAL4-OK107, had significantly impaired expression of Ca-α1T-GFSTF and 44E04-LexA in α/β neurons (double arrows) in adult brains. As an internal control, the PB expression of Ca-α1T-GFSTF was intact under <italic>E93</italic> RNAi knockdown driven by GAL4-OK107. (E-F) <italic>E93</italic> knockdown did not block the expression of 70F05-LexA in α/β neurons to cause the detectable morphological defect in lobe regions (double-arrows). (G-H) However, compared to the wild-type, Ab-GFP expression was ectopically expressed in more than half of 70F05-LexA-positive neurons (double-arrows) when <italic>E93</italic> was knocked down in KCs. The expression levels of 44E04-LexA and 70F05-LexA were visualized by lexAop-myr-GFP in panels C-F and lexAop-mCD8::RFP in panels G and H. Lobes of γ, α/β and α/β neurons were outlined in blue, white and green, respectively, in panels C-F. Cell numbers of 70F05-LexA- and Ab-GFP-positive neurons were counted in S7 Fig. Scale bar: 10 µm. (I) In control samples, including yw, <italic>Ca-</italic>α<italic>1T</italic> RNAi-, <italic>E93</italic> RNAi- and α/β neural driver (13F02-AD/70F05-DBD)-only flies, it took around eight hours for the minimal speed (purple spots) to be reached at night. However, flies took around two to four hours to achieve a minimal speed when RNAi’s for <italic>Ca-</italic>α<italic>1T</italic> and <italic>E93</italic> were overexpressed using 13F02-AD/70F05-DBD. Moving speed (black line) from the second day to the fifth day was calculated as the overall traveling distance (mm) for 30 min. Standard deviation (in grey) for each time-point is shown. The bar graph depicts the duration of food region exploration (X to Z zones, from proximal to distal). All flies, except for <italic>Ca-</italic>α<italic>1T</italic> knockdown samples, tended to explore more in the X zone in the day-time. ZT: Zeitgeber time. The setting and analysis of the behavioral assay is detailed in S8 Fig.</p></caption>
<graphic xlink:href="663451v2_fig2.tif" mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image"/>
</fig>
<p>Since <italic>Ca-</italic>α<italic>1T</italic> encodes a subunit of a T-type like voltage gated calcium channel, which regulates sleep behavior [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>], we wondered whether the loss of <italic>E93</italic> and <italic>Ca-</italic>α<italic>1T</italic> in α/β neurons could cause behavioral defects. To examine the behavior, we utilized a monitoring system to film and analyze the activities of individual flies (S8A-B Fig). The animal’s speed of locomotion usually peaks around the day-to-night shift and gradually becomes reduced at night. In control samples (wild-type, RNAi-only, and GAL4-only lines), it took around eight hours for the moving speed to reach a minimum during the night period (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2I</xref>). Interestingly, night-time activity was significantly impaired (with a sharp reduction of moving speed to a minimal value at around two to four hours into the night period) when <italic>Ca-</italic>α<italic>1T</italic> and <italic>E93</italic> were knocked down using α/β neural drivers, 13F02-AD/70F05-DBD and c739-GAL4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>] (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2I</xref> and S8C-F Fig). Although the overall moving speed was lower in samples of <italic>E93</italic> knockdown driven by c739-GAL4 than in samples of other genotypes, the wings of these <italic>E93</italic> knockdown flies appeared curly and aberrant, which might cause the movement defect. In addition to the effects on night-time activity, RNAi knockdown of <italic>Ca-</italic>α<italic>1T</italic> and <italic>E93</italic> seemed to compromise the foraging-related behavior (S8C Fig). Compared to control flies, <italic>Ca-</italic>α<italic>1T-</italic>deficient animals (especially for RNAi knockdown by c739-GAL4) tended to explore regions without fly food during the day-time period (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2I</xref> and S8F Fig). Taken together, these results suggested that Ca-α1T (whose expression is regulated by E93) acts in α/β neurons to potentially control animal behavior.</p>

<p>We next asked if E93 indeed plays a crucial role in specifying α/β neural identity, i.e., does gain of E93 function transform the cell identity of other KC types to α/β neurons? In contrast to the undetectable Ca-α1T-GFSTF expression in wild-type with two main KC types, γ and α’/β’ neurons, at the WL stage, Ca-α1T-GFSTF expression was precociously upregulated in KCs when E93 was overexpressed by GAL4-OK107 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3A-B</xref>). Similarly, a portion of putative γ neurons exhibited α/β-neural like features (myr::GFP driven by R70F05-LexA) with axonal defects when E93 was overexpressed by the γ-neural driver, GAL4-201Y [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>] (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3C-D</xref>). Consistent with this observation, we further found that E93 overexpression driven by GAL4-OK107 (but not Worniu-GAL4, a pan-neuroblast driver [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>]) compromised the expression of specific markers in γ neurons at various developmental stages, including Ab-GFP, the receptor for insect molting hormone ecdysone (EcR-B1) and Mamo isoforms (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3E-J</xref> and S9-S10 Fig). Along with the effect of impairing γ-specific marker expression, we further found that E93 overexpression driven by GAL4-OK107 impaired the expression of markers in α’/β’ neurons, including Mamo<sup>D∼G</sup> isoforms and Lac-FSVS (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3I-L</xref>). Its overexpression also caused morphological defects by perturbing the remodeling process that normally occurs in early-born KCs at 24-hour after puparium formation (APF; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3K-L</xref>). These results taken together suggested that E93 when overexpressed is sufficient to cause specification of KCs toward the α/β neural identity.</p>

<p>(A-B) Overexpression of E93 driven by GAL4-OK107 caused precocious expression of α/β-specific Ca-α1T-GFSTF in early-born KCs at the WL stage. (C-D) In addition, overexpression of E93 driven by a γ-neural driver, GAL4-201Y (magenta), ectopically turned on the expression of a α/β-specific 70F05-LexA driver in a portion of γ neurons (visualized by myr-GFP in green; arrow).

<title>Hierarchical genetic network of <italic>chinmo</italic>, <italic>mamo</italic>, <italic>E93</italic> and <italic>ab</italic> controls the cell identity of main KC types</title>
<p>Since Chinmo and E93 act as key TFs to regulate the cell identity of main KC types, we wondered whether <italic>chinmo</italic> and <italic>E93</italic> might form a genetic network to diversify these KC types. Since <italic>chinmo</italic> controls the expression of γ-specific Ab [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>] (S2 Fig), we decided to test whether the loss of Ab-GFP by E93 overexpression (seen in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3F</xref>) was caused by compromised Chinmo expression. However, we did not observe a reduction of Chinmo level upon E93 overexpression at the first instar larval stage (the most abundant Chinmo expression stage in the wild-type [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>]), even though the same manipulation did block Ab-GFP expression (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4A-B</xref>).

<p>After the diminishment of Chinmo at the early pupal stage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>], we wonder whether E93 would be disinhibited in γ neurons and whether their neural identity would be transformed if this disinhibition indeed occurs? Since γ neurons exist in adult brains and their neural identity is crucially regulated by Mamo at the pupal stage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>], we then tested whether Mamo takes over Chinmo’s role to suppress E93 expression in γ neurons. As such, <italic>mamo</italic> RNAi knockdown indeed caused the upregulation of E93-GFSTF in KCs (within enriched Trio expression) of adult brains but not brains at the WL stage (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4E-G</xref>), suggesting that Mamo could inhibit E93 expression in γ neurons to ensure their neural identity. Since the E93-mediated α/β neural identity is accompanied by absence of certain γ-specific traits, such as Ab-GFP (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2I</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3F</xref>), we next sought to explore whether Ab also plays a crucial role in controlling the KC identity. Intriguingly, we found that the expression of α/β-specific Ca-α1T-GFSTF and E93-GFSTF was not detectable upon Ab overexpression (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4H-J</xref> and S13 Fig). This was accompanied by the expansion of Trio in the cytosol in almost all KCs, indicating the transformation of KCs into γ neuron-like cells. We also noted that RNAi knockdown of <italic>ab</italic> neither abolished Trio expression nor upregulated the expression of Ca-α1T-GFSTF caused by <italic>E93</italic> knockdown in early-born KCs (S14-S15 Fig). Nonetheless, these results together suggested that <italic>chinmo</italic>, <italic>mamo</italic>, <italic>E93</italic> and <italic>ab</italic> form a hierarchical genetic network with potential feedback loops to control the identity of KCs (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Spatially and temporally expressed regulators are employed in the developing nervous system to generate a wide diversity of neuronal types. Spatial patterning cues, such as homeodomain-containing Hox proteins and Sonic Hedgehog, are well documented in the specification of motor neurons and interneurons in the spinal cord [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>]. Beyond spatial identity, temporal regulation provides another axis of neuronal diversification: distinct neuron types are sequentially generated to form the six-layer laminar organization of the mammalian cerebral cortex, illustrating how layer-specific neurons arise from neural progenitors according to their birth order [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>]. Similarly, in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> central nervous system, neural progenitors (neuroblasts) produce different neuron types in an invariant sequence under the control of temporal regulators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>]. Distinct sets of transcription factors expressed sequentially in neuroblasts of the embryonic ventral nerve cord and developing medulla direct fate specification, thereby generating diverse neurons for larval and visual circuit assembly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>]. In addition to sequential neuroblast regulation, temporal expression of transcription factors in postmitotic neurons also contributes to neuronal diversity by conferring distinct identities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>]. For example, among the three sequentially generated KC types, γ, α’/β’, and α/β neurons, BTBzf TFs, Chinmo and Mamo, have been shown to play crucial roles in specifying early-born KCs as γ and α’/β’ neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>]. In this study, we revealed the molecular mechanisms of KC specification by identifying and characterizing Pipsqueak domain-containing TF E93 as a driver of KC identity towards α/β neurons. Our findings that E93 regulates the expression of calcium channel Ca-α1T to subsequently control animal behaviors also provide an illustration that neural identity specification is associated with acquisition of specific functions among main KC types. We further showed that the specification of KC types is controlled via a genetic network formed by <italic>chinmo</italic>, <italic>mamo</italic>, <italic>E93</italic> and <italic>ab</italic>, which mainly controls the KC identity of γ and α/β neurons during construction of the adult MB (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5</xref>).</p>
<p>Despite that reciprocal regulation between BTBzf TFs and E93 has been reported in multiple cell types during the <italic>Drosophila</italic> development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>], here, we disclosed a novel strategy of using genetic networks of <italic>BTBzf TFs</italic> and <italic>E93</italic> to specify distinct cell identities among neurons derived from the same neuroblasts (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5</xref>). To diversify KC types, Chinmo and Mamo take turns to inhibit the E93 expression, thereby establishing the cell identity of γ neurons, as suggested by Ab expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>] (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2I</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4G</xref>). Without the inhibitory effects of Chinmo and Mamo on E93 expression, late-born KCs specify into α/β neurons by turning on the expression of α/β-specific genes and suppressing the expression of γ-specific genes, Ab included (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>). Since E93 is an ecdysone-induced protein and Mamo expression is primed by ecdysone signaling in γ neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>], blocking EcR-B1 is expected to enhance E93 expression in these neurons. By the fact that overexpression of E93 inhibited EcR-B1 expression in γ neurons (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3F, H and J</xref>), future investigations should be able to unravel the intricate regulatory interplay between E93 and ecdysone signaling. In addition, since <italic>E93</italic> knockdown did not alter the lobe morphology of α/β neurons (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2F</xref>), it is also possible that unidentified regulators might work in concert with E93 to specify the cell fate of α/β neurons. Although how the genetic network of <italic>BTBzf TFs</italic> and <italic>E93</italic> specifies α’/β’ neural identity has not yet been fully resolved, the Mamo expression promoted by the low level of Chinmo, which is regulated by the transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) signaling in MB neuroblasts, is crucial for KCs to adopt the α’/β’ neural identity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>]. Intriguingly, our results revealed that E93 overexpression can abolish the expression of Mamo to block KCs from adopting the α’/β’ neural identity (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3J</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3L</xref>). All these results taken together portray that the genetic network of <italic>BTBzf TFs</italic> and <italic>E93</italic> is very likely to control the KC identity during construction of the adult MB. In light of the phylogenetic conservation of the <italic>E93</italic> family and <italic>tramtrack</italic> (<italic>TTK</italic>)-type <italic>BTBzf TFs</italic>, including <italic>chinmo</italic>, <italic>mamo</italic> and <italic>ab</italic>, as Arthropoda-specific genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>], one cannot help but wonder whether <italic>TTK</italic>-type <italic>BTBzf TF</italic>s might have been evolutionally introduced to intervene with <italic>E93</italic> to regulate the development of multiple arthropodan tissues; perhaps future investigations may delineate their relationship on neuron-type diversification in the nervous system.</p>
<p>Once the identities of neuron types are determined by key regulators, how the cells acquire specific functions in the nervous system to eventually participate in animal behaviors? Previous findings together with our current studies might shed some light on this topic. First, the expression of Chinmo and Ab is inhibited in late-born KCs, in part due to the preferential expression of <italic>let-7</italic> in α/β neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>]. In addition, the neuronal (and KC) contribution of <italic>let-7</italic> regulates day- and night-time sleeping behaviors in developmental- and adult-restricted manners [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>]. Furthermore, Chinmo and <italic>let-7</italic> potentially regulate the expression of E93, for which expression in α/β neurons governs the expression of a phylogenetically conserved sleep-modulatory calcium channel Ca-α1T to regulate animal behaviors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>] (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4D</xref> and S12A Fig). Interestingly, blocking neurotransmission with tetanus toxin light chain (TeNT-Ln) in the MB has been shown to promote locomotion, an outcome opposite to the <italic>Ca-</italic>α<italic>1T</italic> knockdown results observed in our study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>] (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2I</xref> and S8E Fig). This discrepancy may stem from TeNT-Ln acting on MB axons to inhibit downstream neurons, whereas the effect of <italic>Ca-</italic>α<italic>1T</italic> knockdown is primarily occurred MB dendrites that receive inputs from upstream neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>] (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1H</xref>). These results together with the previous reported function of E93 in circadian rhythm provide an intriguing link between E93 and sleep-associated behaviors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>]. Since KC types were reported to function crucially in sleep/arousal and alcohol-induced sleep deficit behaviors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>], our finding of KC identity specification and Ca-α1T expression under the regulation of E93 suggests that this process may in some way endow α/β neurons with the capacity to control animal behaviors related to sleep. Since the intricate relationship between sleep and memory is well established [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>], future deeper investigations on cell-type specification of memory-associated neurons are expected to provide insights into how to acquire for unique functions among neurons to regulate these two crucial traits of animals.</p>

Primary antibodies used in this study included guinea pig antibody against Chinmo (1:1000, Sokol laboratory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>]), rat monoclonal antibody against mCD8 (1:100, Thermo Fisher Scientific), rabbit antibody against GFP (1:750, Thermo Fisher Scientific), and mouse monoclonal antibodies against EcR-B1 (1:50, DSHB), Fas2 (1:100, DSHB) and Trio (1:50, DSHB). Secondary antibodies conjugated to different fluorophores (Alexa 488, Alexa 546 and Alexa 647; Thermo Fisher Scientific and Jackson ImmunoResearch Lab, Inc.) were used at 1:750 dilutions. Immunofluorescence images were collected by confocal microscopy on a Zeiss LSM 700, projected using the LSM browser and processed in Adobe Photoshop CS6. All data are representative of more than 3 brains per genotype.</p>

<title>Distance measurement in the behavioral assay and statistical analysis</title>
<p>Individual fly activities were recorded and analyzed using the activity monitor system developed by DroBot, Inc. This system used an open-resourced software pySolo to track individual moving flies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>]. Average speed and standard deviation of individual flies were calculated according to total traveling distance within 30 min periods from the first day to the fifth day, as shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2I</xref> and S8E Fig. Student’s t-test was used for statistical analysis to compare datasets with two groups in S8 Fig.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Understanding the mechanisms of neural specification is a central question in neurobiology. In Drosophila, the mushroom body (MB), which is the associative learning region in the brain, consists of three major cell types: γ, α'/β' and α/β kenyon cells. These classes can be further subdivided into seven subtypes, together comprising ~2000 KCs per hemi-brain. Remarkably, all of these neurons are derived from just four neuroblasts in each hemisphere. Therefore, a lot of endeavours are put to understand how the neuron is specified in the fly MB.</p>
<p>Over the past decade, studies have revealed that MB neuroblasts employ a temporal patterning mechanism, producing distinct neuronal types at different developmental stages. Temporal identity is conveyed through transcription factor expression in KCs. High levels of Chinmo, a BTB-zinc finger transcription factor, promote γ-cell fate (Zhu et al., Cell, 2006). Reduced Chinmo levels trigger expression of mamo, a zinc finger transcription factor that specifies α'/β' identity (Liu et al., eLife, 2019). However, the specification of α/β neurons remains poorly understood. Some evidence suggests that microRNAs regulate the transition from α'/β' to α/β fate (Wu et al., Dev Cell, 2012; Kucherenko et al., EMBO J, 2012). One hypothesis even proposes that α/β represents a &quot;default&quot; state of MB neurons, which could explain the difficulty in identifying dedicated regulators.</p>
<p>The study by Chung et al. challenges this hypothesis. By leveraging previously published RNA-seq datasets (Shih et al., G3, 2019), they systematically screened BAC transgenic lines to selectively label MB subtypes. Using these tools, they analyzed the consequences of manipulating E93 expression and found that E93 is required for α/β specification. Furthermore, loss of E93 impairs MB-dependent behaviors, highlighting its functional importance.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors conducted a thorough analysis of E93 manipulation phenotypes using LexA tools generated from the Janelia Farm and Bloomington collections. They demonstrated that E93 knockdown reduces expression of Ca-α1T, a calcium channel gene identified as an α/β marker. Supporting this conclusion, one LexA line driven by a DNA fragment near EcR (R44E04) showed consistent results. Conversely, overexpression of E93 in γ and α'/β' Kenyon cells led to downregulation of their respective subtype markers.</p>
<p>Another notable strength is the authors' effort to dissect the genetic epistasis between E93 and previously known regulators. Through MARCM and reporter analyses, they showed that Chinmo and Mamo suppress E93, while E93 itself suppresses mamo. This work establishes a compelling molecular model for the regulatory network underlying MB cell-type specification.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The interpretation of E93's role in neuronal specification requires caution. Typically, two criteria are used to establish whether a gene directs neuronal identity:</p>
<p>(1) gene manipulation shifts the neuronal transcriptome from one subtype to another, and</p>
<p>(2) gene manipulation alters axonal projection patterns.</p>
<p>The results presented here only partially satisfy the first criterion. Although markers are affected, it remains possible that the reporter lines and subtype markers used are direct transcriptional targets of E93 in α/β neurons, rather than reflecting broader fate changes. Future studies using transcriptomics would provide a more comprehensive assessment of neuronal identity following E93 perturbation.</p>
<p>With respect to the second criterion, the evidence is also incomplete. While reporter patterns were altered, the overall morphology of the α/β lobes appeared largely intact after E93 knockdown. Overexpression of E93 in γ neurons produced a small subset of cells with α/β-like projections, but this effect warrants deeper characterization before firm conclusions can be drawn.</p>
<p>Overall, this study has nicely shown that E93 can regulate α/β neural identities. Further studies on the regulatory network will help to better understand the mechanism of neurogenesis in mushroom body.</p>

<p>We do plan conduct multi-omics experiments to provide a more comprehensive assessment of neuronal identity upon loss-of-function of E93. However, omics results take time to be conducted and analyzed, so the result will be summarized in a future manuscript.</p>

<p>We did not find the morphological change of mushroom body lobes by examining with the Fas2 staining (shown in Figure S8D).</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p>
<p>(1) The behavioral effect of Ca-α1T knockdown is pretty interesting. But how the downregulation of Ca-α1T in the mushroom body can affect locomotion is puzzling. Even though the mushroom body is known to suppress locomotion (Matin et al., Learn Mem, 1998), the real results are opposite. Can authors give further explanation in the discussion? Also, the behavioral experiments are hard to interpret, given that Figure 2C(1) and Figure 2C(3) as a control, also vary a lot. Since the behavioral experiments don't affect the main conclusion of the paper, I would suggest removing that part or adding more explanation in the discussion.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>First, we have discussed the puzzling part on the MB influence in locomotion between the previous study using tetanus toxin light chain (TeNT-Ln) and our Ca-α1T knockdown result. It is possible that the different effect is derived from TeNT-Ln’s function in MB axons and Ca-α1T’s function in MB dendrites. Secondly, we have re-conducted the behavioral results using a new α/β driver (13F02-AD/70F05-DBD) to replace our initial behavioral results (using c739-GAL4, which would cause the abnormal wing when drives E93 RNAi expression; see S8C(2) Fig). Current results (now in Fig 2I) are more consistent in control groups.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) In the manuscript, the authors use &quot;subtype&quot; to describe γKC, α'/β'KC and α/βKC in the fly MB. However, in most of the literature, people use &quot;main types&quot; to summarize these three types, and &quot;subtype&quot; is mostly about the difference in γd, γm, α'/β'ap, α'/β'm, α/βp, α/βs and α/βc KC (Shih et al., G3, 2019). Replacing &quot;subtypes&quot; with &quot;main types&quot; will help to increase the clarity.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have replaced &quot;KC subtypes&quot; with &quot;main KC types&quot; or just “KC types”.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) The authors have identified a lot of new markers for the KC cell types, and some of them are used in this manuscript. It will be helpful if they can have a figure to summarize the markers they used in this study and what cell types they labeled.</p>
