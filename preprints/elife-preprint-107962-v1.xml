<abstract>
    <title>Abstract</title><p>How minute pathogenic signals trigger decisive immune responses is a fundamental question in biology. Classical signaling often relies on ATP-driven enzymatic cascades, but innate immunity frequently employs death fold domain (DFD) self-assembly. The energetic basis of this assembly is unknown. Here, we show that specific DFDs function as energy reservoirs through metastable supersaturation. Characterizing all 109 human DFDs, we identified sequence-encoded nucleation barriers specifically in the central adaptors of inflammatory signalosomes, allowing them to accumulate far above their saturation concentration while remaining soluble and poised for activation. We demonstrate that the inflammasome adaptor ASC is constitutively supersaturated <italic>in vivo</italic>, retaining energy to power on-demand cell death. Swapping a non-supersaturable DFD in the apoptosome with a supersaturable one sensitized cells to sublethal stimuli. Mapping all DFD nucleating interactions revealed that supersaturated adaptors are specifically templated by other DFDs in their respective pathways, limiting deleterious crosstalk. Across human cell types, adaptor supersaturation strongly correlates with cell turnover, implicating this thermodynamic principle in the trade-off between immunity and longevity. Profiling homologues from fish, sponge, and bacteria, we find nucleation barriers to be ancestrally conserved. These findings reveal DFD adaptors as biological phase-change materials that function like batteries, storing and privatizing energy for life-or-death decisions.</p>

<p>Innate immune signalling transduces small signals to robust responses such as programmed cell death and/or inflammation. While the binding of a pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) to receptors initiates signaling, this initial interaction releases insufficient energy to directly change cell state. That tiny signal must be amplified in an energy consuming process that is fundamental to understanding the architecture and evolution of these critical signaling networks.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup> Innate immune signaling networks from bacteria to humans amplify signaling through interactions between nonenzymatic death fold domains (DFDs).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup> However, the energetic basis for DFD function remains enigmatic (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>).</p>

Discontinuous DFDs exhibit a range of concentrations where self-assembly occurs stochastically, indicating an intrinsic nucleation barrier. The four instances of visible assemblies despite no AmFRET-positive cells are presumed to result from those DFDs partitioning with other cellular components or endogenous condensates wherein they remain too dilute to FRET.</p><p>C.

<p>DFDs commonly form paracrystalline polymers that can template their own growth when free subunits exceed their saturation concentration (C<sub>sat</sub>). Polymers are functionally initiated by PAMP-bound receptor oligomerization. To preclude signaling through spontaneous nucleation, DFDs are presumed to be effectively subsaturated prior to activation, through a combination of low basal expression, subcellular compartmentalization, post-translational modifications, and regulatory interactions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup> We previously discovered, however, that the DFD-containing adaptor Bcl10 exhibits an intrinsic nucleation barrier that is large enough to support persistent deep supersaturation in vivo, allowing it to amplify signaling independently of orthogonal input.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>Here, we propose that DFDs broadly function as long-term energy reservoirs via metastable supersaturation, a state where a protein exceeds C<sub>sat</sub> yet remains in solution due to structurally-determined nucleation barriers. This mechanism would allow cells to respond to PAMPs immediately, decisively, and independently of metabolism, which is frequently compromised during infection.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup> For DFDs to function in this manner, their endogenous concentration would need to greatly exceed their respective C<sub>sat</sub> values, while they nevertheless remain soluble over timescales spanning the window of vulnerability to infection, i.e. the full lifetimes of cells. Cells would therefore be continuously susceptible to spontaneous death and inflammation through stochastic nucleation events, imposing a fundamental tradeoff between immunity and longevity.</p>
<p>We here use a combination of biophysical, bioinformatic, and cytological approaches to investigate the capacity and functional relevance of supersaturation by human DFDs. Our results collectively uncover the energetic basis for signal amplification by DFDs and in turn a thermodynamic drive to die.</p>
<sec id="s2">
<title>A select subset of DFDs have intrinsic nucleation barriers enabling persistent supersaturation</title>
    <p>To systematically survey the ability of DFDs to supersaturate, we compiled an exhaustive set of 109 structurally independent human DFDs (Table S1 and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs6">Figure S1A</xref>) and then characterized their tendency to self-assemble in near-physiological conditions while minimizing interference from other proteins. For this purpose we used distributed amphifluoric FRET (DAmFRET) in an orthogonal eukaryotic host that completely lacks endogenous DFDs and their associated regulatory machinery –– <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>. DAmFRET produces a snapshot of the population-level distribution of single-cell measurements of ratiometric FRET (“AmFRET”) between two fluorescent forms of the same protein species.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup> The data revealed a diversity of behaviours (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B-C</xref>, <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">S1C</xref>, and Table S1), ranging from no self-association to self-association in all cells at all concentrations. A minority (21) of the DFDs transitioned from no to high AmFRET in a discontinuous manner, the signature of a large intrinsic nucleation barrier.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup></p>
    <p>Using high-throughput confocal microscopy, we observed subcellular assemblies for most of the DFDs that populated AmFRET-positive states, but not those with entirely low AmFRET (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). Nucleation barriers increase with the entropic cost of assembly.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup> Assemblies with large barriers therefore tend to be more ordered than those without. Ordered assembly often manifests as long filaments in cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup> As predicted, most of the assemblies of DFDs that had transitioned discontinuously had fibrillar morphologies, whereas those that had transitioned continuously (low-to-high DAmFRET) instead mostly formed spherical or amorphous puncta (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">S1E-G</xref>).</p>
    <p>For discontinuous DFDs, the soluble protomers in the low FRET cells are hypothetically poised to assemble; they just lack a structural template to get them started. We tested this hypothesis by co-expressing genetically encoded “seeds” (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D-E</xref>),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup> and found that the seeds caused cells to switch to the high AmFRET population for most discontinuous DFDs but not continuous DFDs (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>, <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">S1H</xref>, Table S1). We further verified that assembly was mediated by native DFD subunit interfaces rather than amyloid-like misfolding (Supplemental Information, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Figure S2A-B</xref>). Altogether, these data confirm that a subset of DFDs have native ensembles that can supersaturate in a soluble form to power subsequent switch-like assembly.</p>
<p>The magnitude of supersaturation in vivo is determined by the ratio of a protein’s total concentration to its C<sub>sat</sub>, which reflects the strength of interactions between subunits in its assembled structure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup> Total concentration and C<sub>sat</sub> can evolve independently by gene regulation and DFD sequence, respectively. Consequently, if the function of discontinuous DFDs involves supersaturation, we would expect evolution to have lowered their C<sub>sat</sub> while raising their expression relative to continuous DFDs. To test these predictions, we first analyzed the relationship of nucleation barriers to C<sub>sat</sub>, as determined by each protein’s transition concentration in the presence of seed. As expected, discontinuous DFDs exhibited lower C<sub>sat</sub> values than continuous DFDs (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G</xref>, Table S1), and in the absence of seed achieved soluble concentrations that exceeded them by at least four-fold on average (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1H</xref>).</p>

<title>Nucleation barriers are a characteristic feature of inflammatory signalosome adaptors</title>
    <p>We next evaluated the relationship of nucleation barriers to DFD concentrations in vivo. Using published proteomic datasets,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup> we found that proteins with discontinuous DFDs tend to be expressed more abundantly than those with continuous DFDs, both at the cell type and tissue levels (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">S3A-B</xref> and Table S1). We then used a high-coverage transcriptomics dataset<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup> to ask how C<sub>sat</sub> values relate to DFD gene expression in primary immune cells. Remarkably, transcript abundances significantly anticorrelated with C<sub>sat</sub> in 17 out 18 canonical immune cell populations (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref> and <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">S3C</xref>). Such a relationship is highly unusual for soluble proteins, whose expression instead tends to strongly correlate with C<sub>sat</sub>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup> These analyses collectively indicate that discontinuous DFDs are likely to be functionally supersaturated in their endogenous physiological contexts.</p>

    <p>Given the low frequency of nucleation barriers among DFDs, is there an enrichment for them somewhere within the signaling network? A protein’s importance to a biological response can be approximated by its centrality in the corresponding network.

Proteins that bridge many other nodes, or have high “betweenness centrality”, act as bottlenecks that control information flow through the network. We observed that proteins with discontinuous and/or seedable DFDs have greater degree and betweenness centralities (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref> and <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">S3D</xref>), consistent with their controlling signaling.</p>
    <p>For a DFD nucleation barrier to enable on-demand assembly, the DFD must remain supersaturated even as a full-length (FL) protein. The potential for rapid, on-demand assembly would be diminished if other parts of the protein prematurely trigger nucleation or destabilize the assembled state. We therefore evaluated the phase behaviours of 21 diverse DFD-containing FL multidomain proteins. Most of the proteins behaved the same way as their respective DFDs (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4">Figure S4A</xref>, and Table S2). Six proteins suppressed the ability of their DFDs to supersaturate, resulting in continuous low or moderate DAmFRET that we found reflects autoinhibited oligomerization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4">Figure S4B</xref>), consistent with prior findings for multiple DFD-containing receptors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup> Only five of the FL proteins retained or enhanced their DFDs’ nucleation barriers: ASC, BCL10, FADD, MAVS, and TRADD (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4">Figure S4A</xref>, and Table S2). Strikingly, they span all four subfamilies and function specifically as adaptors in well-characterized signalosomes linking pathogen sensing to inflammation and/or inflammatory cell death (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>). In contrast, signalosomes with primarily non-immunity functions –– the apoptosome, the PIDDosome, and the ectodysplasin (EDA) receptor complex –– lacked supersaturation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2G</xref>). Consistent with their functioning through supersaturation, only the former set of adaptors are more abundantly expressed than their cognate receptors in the human body (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>). These data collectively identify the adaptors, specifically, of inflammatory signalosomes as energy reservoirs for signal amplification.</p>

<title>Nucleation barriers facilitate signal amplification in human cells</title>
<p>To explore the functionality of supersaturation, we focused on two modes of programmed cell death signaling that differed in this regard: intrinsic apoptosis (no nucleation barrier) and pyroptosis (with nucleation barrier). The former occurs downstream of persistent intracellular stresses.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup> The latter is instead triggered by minute levels of PAMPs and therefore involves greater signal amplification.</p>
<p>To test if the absence of nucleation barriers limits the sensitivity of the apoptosome, we adapted an optogenetic approach<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup> to precisely control apoptosome initiation. HEK293T cells lack the inflammasome constituents NLRC4, ASC, and CASP1, allowing us to repurpose their DFDs in this cell line. Accordingly, we transduced the cells with mScarlet-I fusions of either the non-supersaturable WT apoptosome effector, CASP9, or a chimeric version that harbored the supersaturable DFD of CASP1 in place of its own (CASP9<sup>CASP1CARD</sup>). We simultaneously transduced the cells with blue light-inducible seeds of the cognate upstream DFD –– opto-APAF1 or opto-NLRC4, to respectively create non-supersaturable and supersaturable versions of the apoptosome (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). Before comparing amplification, we first assessed the abilities of the reconstituted apoptosomes to simply engage CASP9 when active, by measuring the activation of CASP3/7, the downstream target of CASP9, after one minute of blue light stimulation. Both cell lines activated a fluorescent CASP3/7 reporter to the same extent at this time point (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>), confirming that both apoptosomes can in principle signal effectively.</p>

<p>To now assess signal amplification, we evaluated both the persistence of DFD assemblies and their ability to commit cells to apoptosis following an otherwise sublethal stimulus. We anticipated that cells expressing the non-supersaturable apoptosome will 1) form reversible clusters and consequently 2) survive a short blue light stimulus. In contrast, cells expressing the supersaturable apoptosome will 1) form irreversible clusters that prolong signaling, and consequently 2) die even after a short blue light stimulus.</p>
<p>To test prediction 1, we stimulated the cells with blue light for one minute and monitored subsequent protein localization. We found that both apoptosomes formed puncta in essentially all cells within one minute (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C-D</xref>; Movie S1). The non-supersaturable apoptosomes then dissolved over the course of the next 10 minutes. In contrast, the supersaturable apoptosomes instead continued to grow at a constant rate for at least the next 20 minutes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C-D</xref>; Movie S2).</p>
<p>To test prediction 2, we measured cell death two hours after the initiation of blue light stimulation for either one minute or the entire two hours. Neither apoptosome induced cell death in the absence of blue light (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>). The non-supersaturable version induced death in approximately 18% and 55% of cells following the short and long stimulation, respectively (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>), confirming the expected dose-dependence of signaling. In contrast, the supersaturable apoptosome induced death in most cells even upon short stimulation, confirming that supersaturation-mediated DFD polymerization amplifies signaling.</p>

    <p>We next asked if pyroptosis and extrinsic apoptosis are indeed powered by adaptor supersaturation in vivo.

<p>To eliminate the potentially confounding effects of orthogonal dsDNA sensors,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup> we next placed AIM2<sup>PYD</sup> under blue light control and confirmed that the resulting fusion protein –– “opto-AIM2” –– grants direct control over seed formation (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4C</xref>, top). Using this system, a transient blue light exposure induced AIM2 clustering within seconds and cell death within ten minutes (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C-D</xref> and Movie S3-S4). Next, we evaluated if cell death depended on ASC or FADD. We found that stimulating WT cells with a one second blue laser pulse every 15 minutes killed essentially all of them within one hour (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>). In contrast, only half of cells lacking ASC (<italic>PYCARD</italic>-KO) died, and they did so with delayed kinetics consistent with FADD-driven apoptosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup></p>
    <p>Finally, we directly assessed inflammasome nucleation by AIM2<sup>PYD</sup> seeds. To do so we reconstituted the <italic>PYCARD</italic>-KO with mScarlet-I-tagged ASC and titrated its expression to well below endogenous levels so as to circumvent any potential for the fusion tag to enhance the protein’s oligomerization (although this would be unexpected;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs5">Figure S5C-D</xref>). We then tracked AIM2<sup>PYD</sup> and ASC localization following a 10-second laser pulse. Both proteins began to cluster almost immediately. AIM2<sup>PYD</sup> clusters ceased growing by 5 minutes, whereas ASC clusters continued to grow for the full duration of the time course (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>). The plasma membrane concomitantly permeabilized as a result of gasdermin D (GSDMD) activation,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup> and to an extent that increased with the level of ASC expression (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4G</xref>). These data collectively confirm that endogenous ASC is highly supersaturated prior to stimulation, and that the extent of supersaturation determines the extent of signal amplification.</p>
    <p>Given that inflammatory signalosomes frequently initiate programmed cell death, and that a kinetic barrier governs their activity, the susceptibility of cells to aberrant cell death through spontaneous nucleating fluctuations is expected to increase with the level of adaptor supersaturation in vivo. This would constrain cell lifespan if such nucleation occurs with appreciable frequency. To explore this possibility, we asked how adaptor supersaturation (as approximated by the ratio of mRNA levels to C<sub>sat</sub> values) relates to the turnover rates of each cell type in the human body.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup> We found that short-lived cells such as monocytes indeed have greater DFD supersaturation than long-lived cells such as neurons (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4H</xref>). Among individual DFD proteins, cell turnover correlated especially strongly with the expression level of ASC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs5">Figure S5F-G</xref>), suggesting that lifespan may be limited by the thermodynamic drive for inflammatory signal amplification.</p>

<title>The nucleating interactome is highly specific</title>
    <p>DFDs share the same fold and are co-expressed in many of the same cells. While spontaneous nucleation of supersaturable DFDs poses an inherent risk of inadvertently activating end fate cell signalling, this possibility is multiplied by the risk of cross-activation between DFDs in different pathways. To what extent do they nucleate each other? To determine specificity and systematically map the nucleating interactome of DFDs, we mated our library of seed-expressing yeast strains with a library of strains expressing each mEos3-fused DFD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs6">Figure S6A</xref>) to create over 10,000 arrayed diploid yeast strains that we then screened by DAmFRET (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs6">Figure S6B and C</xref>).</p>

As an exception, PYDs of the inflammasome and DEDs of the Death-Inducing Signaling Complex (DISC) nucleated each other (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our systematic investigation reveals that metastable supersaturation of a select subset of adaptor proteins provides an energetic basis for DFD-mediated signal amplification.</p>
<p>Seminal studies on the structures of DFDs have led to the common view that DFDs <italic>generally</italic> function to scaffold signaling through homotypic self-assembly.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref></sup> We were therefore surprised to find that less than half of the 109 human DFDs can self-assemble, and many of the ones that can, lack sufficient nucleation barriers to appreciably supersaturate, precluding them from amplifying signals without additional energy expenditure by the cell. The only DFDs to supersaturate in full-length protein contexts are the adaptors of inflammatory signalosomes. The sparsity of this property revealed a hierarchy of DFD protein functions, wherein a core set of signal amplifying adaptors each interact with a sequence-specified set of receptors, effectors, and regulators that categorically lack nucleation barriers. Because nucleation involves only a tiny fraction of the supersaturated adaptors, they are poised to amplify minute signals from their cognate receptors and transduce them to their cognate effectors, precisely as required for innate immunity. Because this attribute is conserved across homologous animal adaptors and into the DFD progenitors of multicellular bacteria, we conclude that energy storage for on-demand signaling may be the principal ancestral function of DFDs.</p>
<p>Myd88, a prominent inflammatory adaptor that links Toll-like receptors (TLRs) to pro-inflammatory NF-κB,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref></sup> defied this trend by assembling without a nucleation barrier in our experiments. This is consistent with its endogenous occurrence as hexameric oligomers prior to stimulation,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref></sup> and their coalescence to numerous puncta following stimulation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref></sup> We speculate that its close collaboration with kinases and ubiquitin ligases, which perform conventional ATP-fueled signal amplification, achieves the switch-like response of TLR pathways. Other ancient innate immune signaling systems such as the viral dsDNA sensor, cGAS, likewise amplify signaling through nucleotide hydrolysis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref></sup></p>
<p>We liken these supersaturated DFD adaptors to ‘phase-change materials’ in industrial thermal batteries, accumulating potential energy for privatized deployment upon nucleation,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref></sup> unlike signaling cascades that rely on shared chemical fuels like ATP. As the discharged state of the battery, DFD assemblies are effectively irreversible, committing the cell to terminal responses like death. This battery function rationalizes DFD prevalence over more common assembly modes like liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS; <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D</xref>). While LLPS offers sensitivity that can enhance PAMP detection,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref></sup> its rapidly diminishing nucleation barrier with increasing supersaturation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref></sup> makes it unsuitable for long-term, high-energy storage needed for rapid signal amplification.</p>
<p>Signalosome effectors activate through simple induced-proximity mechanisms that lack specific structural requirements of the DFDs themselves,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref></sup> which suggests that the structures of DFD polymers are determined by a function of the solution phase <italic>prior to activation</italic>. Our finding that the function is energy storage rationalizes the strikingly regular structure of DFD polymers. The evolution of this function would have been driven by selection <italic>against</italic> premature assembly, favoring paracrystalline structures whose infrequent nucleation allows energy storage over a cell’s lifetime. This differs from selection <italic>for</italic> a specific functional polymer structure, as seen for example in microtubules. This principle may also explain the use of other paracrystalline modules like TIR domains and functional amyloids in immune signaling, as well as the dearth of non-nucleated polymers like DIX and SAM domains that abound in other signaling pathways.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref></sup></p>
<p>The ability of a protein fold to crystallize has few structural constraints, allowing relatively small changes in sequence to produce orthogonal signaling modules. The resulting evolvability may be essential in the never-ending arms race against pathogens. High specificity also insulates pathways from each other and from cellular processes and metabolic fluctuations that could aberrantly activate them to lethal consequence.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">74</xref></sup></p>
<p>Our findings imply that cells perpetually await death. The cumulative certainty of stochastic nucleation appears to be reflected in the observed relationship of DFD supersaturation to mortality rates across human cell types. We speculate that this underpins a fundamental tradeoff between innate immunity and lifespan, potentially contributing to age-related inflammation and stem cell exhaustion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">75</xref></sup>.</p>

    <p>Twelve human proteins contain two DFDs, typically one closely following the other. To determine if the DFDs in such pairs should be evaluated independently or together, we used the predicted aligned error (PAE) matrix generated by AlphaFold3.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">79</xref></sup> PAE is the expected positional error at residue x if the predicted and actual structures are aligned on residue y. Seven of the DFD pairs exhibited very low interdomain PAE scores comparable to those of the component DFDs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Figure S1B</xref>, bottom), suggesting a conserved fixed geometric relationship between the domains. We therefore considered these tandem DFDs as single members of their respective subfamilies. Similarly, we excluded the annotated<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup> PYD-like domain of CENP-N because the PAE matrix and experimental structures show that it is in fact part of a larger non-DFD.</p>

<title>Plasmid construction</title>
<p>Yeast expression plasmids were made as previously described.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup> Briefly, we used a high copy episomal vector, V08, which contains inverted BsaI sites to support Golden Gate cloning, followed by a rigid helical linker 4x(EAAAR) and mEos3.1.

The vector V12 is identical to V08 except that mEos3.1 and linker precedes rather than follows the BsaI sites, for expressing proteins with an N-terminal fusion. Inserts were ordered as yeast codon-optimized GeneArt Strings (Thermo Fisher) flanked by Type IIs restriction sites for ligation between BsaI sites in V08 and V12. Fusions were made opposite the native N– or C-terminus of each DFD to minimize non-native steric effects. All other inserts were cloned into respective vectors via Gibson assembly between the promoter and respective tag. All plasmids were verified by Sanger sequencing. All expression plasmids are listed in Table S1.</p>

The arrayed library of resulting strains was then mated to each of the rhy1713 strains expressing separate DFD-mEos3.1 fusions, by pinning each pair of strains together onto agar omnitrays containing SD-URA+NAT+dox media.

<title>DAmFRET assay preparation and data collection</title>
<p>We performed DAmFRET as previously described.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup> Briefly, single transformant yeast colonies were inoculated in 200 μL of SD-URA in a 96-well microplate well and incubated in a Heidolph Titramax platform shaker at 30°C, 1350 RPM overnight. Cells were washed with sterile water, resuspended in galactose-containing media, and allowed to continue incubating for approximately 20 h. Microplates were then illuminated for 25 min with 320–500 nm violet light to photoconvert a fraction of mEos3 molecules from a green (516 nm) form to a red form (581 nm). At this point, cells were either used to collect microscopy data or continue the DAmFRET protocol.</p>
<p>For the nucleating interaction screen, glycerol stock plates were pinned into liquid SD-URA without dox and incubated for 16 h at 30°C with 1350 RPM shaking overnight. We then resuspended cells in fresh SD-URA media and continued incubation for an additional 20 h. After this, we resuspended cells in SGal-URA and continued incubation for 20 h to induce protein expression. Finally, we resuspended cells in fresh SGal-URA for 4 h prior to DAmFRET data collection. The library was then consolidated into 96 384-well plates.</p>
<p>DAmFRET data were collected on a ZE5 cell analyzer cytometer. Autofluorescence was detected with 405 nm excitation and 460/22 nm emission; side scatter (SSC) and forward scatter (FSC) were detected with 488 nm excitation and 488/10 nm emission. Donor and FRET fluorescence were detected with 488 nm excitation and 425/35 nm or 593/52 nm emission, respectively. Acceptor fluorescence was detected with 561 nm excitation and 589/15 nm emission. For each well, we collected a volume of 13 μL, resulting in approximately 500,000 events per sample. Data compensation was done in the built-in tool for compensation (Everest software V1.1) on single-color controls: non-photoconverted mEos3.1 and dsRed2 (as a proxy for the red form of mEos3). For nucleating interactions, we included an additional channel for mCardinal intensity with 561 nm excitation and 670/30 nm emission.</p>

<title>DAmFRET data analysis</title>
<p>Data were processed on FCS Express Plus 6.04.0015 software (De Novo). Events were gated for single unbudded cells by FSC vs. SSC, followed by gating of live cells with low autofluorescence and positive donor and acceptor fluorescence. With the exception of TNFRSF10A<sup>DD</sup> (TRAIL-R1) (rhx2933) which failed to express with either its C– or N-terminus tagged, all expression plasmids were processed. Plots represent the distribution of AmFRET (FRET intensity/acceptor intensity) vs. acceptor intensity (protein expression).</p>
<p>We then analysed the data as previously described.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup> Briefly, FCS files were gated using an automated R-script running in flowCore. Before gating, the forward scatter (FS00.A, FS00.W, FS00.H), side scatter (SS02.A), donor fluorescence (FL03.A), and autofluorescence (FL17.A) channels were transformed using a logicle transform in R. Single cells were gated using FS00.A vs SS02.A and FS00.H vs FS00.W. These were gated for expressing cells using FL03.A vs FL17.A. Cells falling within these gates were then exported as FCS3.0 files for further analysis.</p>
<p>DAmFRET histograms were divided into 64 logarithmically spaced bins across a predetermined range large enough to accommodate all data sets. The upper gate values were determined for each bin as the 99th percentile of the DAmFRET distribution in that bin. We used the expression of mEos3.1 alone to delineate the region of a DAmFRET plot that corresponds to no assembly. For all samples, cells falling above this region are considered to contain protein assemblies (FRET-positive). The fraction of cells in the assembled population was plotted as a ratio to the total cells in the bin for all 64 bins. The gross fraction of such cells expressing a given protein is reported as fgate.</p>

<title>Determination of continuity</title>
<p>We initially attempted to classify each DAmFRET dataset as one-state or two-state, and discontinuous or continuous for the latter, using an algorithm previously developed for this purpose.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">81</xref></sup> However, the algorithm invariably misclassified discontinuous datasets as “continuous” when the AmFRET level of the high FRET state changed with concentration, i.e. exhibited positive or negative slope as for FAS<sup>DD</sup> and CASP2<sup>CARD</sup>, respectively. Due to this limitation, we adopted a different method.</p>
<p>To determine the continuity of an adequately expressed plasmid, we analysed the distribution of AmFRET values about the transition region. To do so, we fit a spline to the median AmFRET values across binned concentrations that met a density cutoff defined by a minimum of 20 cells, a minimum cell density of 500, and no more than 25% of cells being defined as an outlier. The bin density is measured by the number of cells divided by the interquartile range (IQR) of AmFRET values within that bin. The number of bins was determined using Scott’s rule for number of bins in a histogram. The median AmFRET values were calculated for each bin, and then denoised using the Python SciPy.signal.sosfiltfilt, resulting in the spline fit. This was bootstrapped 100 times with the average of all bootstraps reported as the final spline fit. The resulting spline was used to determine the transition region. The transition point is defined as the concentration with the greatest change in AmFRET. Therefore, this value was calculated as the maximum of the first derivative of the fitted spline, using the numpy.diff package. The transition range is defined as the region between the maximum positive and negative rate of change, indicating where the transition between FRET states is starting and ending, respectively. The transition starting point is calculated as the maximum of the second derivative that lies before the transition point, and the transition endpoint is calculated as the minimum of the second derivative that lies after the transition point. This is done on all 100 bootstrapped splines, with the median of each measure reported. Hartigan &amp; Hartigan’s dip test for unimodality was used to determine the continuity of AmFRET values within the determined transition range. Plots are classified as “discontinuous” or “continuous” for p-values less than or greater than 0.05, respectively.</p>
<p>Plasmids that were determined to have a continuous transition were further classified as uniformly low (“low”), uniformly high (“high”), or transitioned from low to high with increasing concentration (“low to high”). This was done by extracting the minimum and ending AmFRET values from the spline fit. As a reference for the AmFRET value that indicates the start of a high FRET state, the AmFRET value of the transition start point of a control plasmid, rhx0927, was used. For each plasmid, if its minimum and ending AmFRET values fell below the reference, it was classified as low. If both fell above, it was classified as high. Those with a minimum value below and an ending value above were classified as “low to high”. The majority classification of replicates for each plasmid is reported.</p>

<title>Determination of positive nucleating interactions</title>
<p>We first excluded files with fewer than 2500 events positive for mEos3 or mean acceptor intensities less than 3.5 p.d.u. From this, any DFD or seed left with less than 25% of their original instances after filtering were removed from the analysis completely. Next, we identified nucleating interactions as DFD pairs that decreased the C50 and increased the fraction assembled (fgate). We standardized all variables for each experimental batch of DFDs to a mean of 0 and variance of 1. We then determined the outlier degree for C50 and fgate based on the number of interquartile ranges below or above the median for these values. This was done directionally on a per-DFD basis. We defined the “nucleating interactions” for a given mEos3-fused DFD as those whose mean of these two values (reported as “seedability”) is greater than or equal to 3 standard deviations above the mean of all seedability values. We confirmed that the seedability values for most DFD pairs partitioned with that of two negative controls included for each DFD.</p>
<p>To evaluate the reproducibility of our assay, we replicated it for a set of 36 DFDs. This replicate analysis mirrored the original, except it utilized the DFD distributions and cutoff values from the first set. The Pearson correlation (R) between the two sets was 0.91 (p &lt; 0.0001). To minimize the impact of random variations in negatives and outliers, we excluded double negative instances, resulting in a slightly altered Pearson correlation (R) of 0.90 (p &lt; 0.0001). Of the 3423 DFD + seed combinations reassessed, 16 showed inconsistent hit-calling, indicating an assay consistency rate of 99.53% with a 95% confidence interval ranging from 99.30% to 99.76%.</p>

<title>Approximating C<sub>sat</sub> and supersaturability</title>
<p>To generate an average DAmFRET curve, we computed the mean of each histogram bin in the DAmFRET dataset, focusing on bins containing a minimum of 100 cells. The average DAmFRET curve for each DFD in the presence of its self-seed was fit to a Weibull function as follows. We first calculated the average AmFRET value in each concentration bin. The resulting curves resemble the fraction-assembled curves except that the asymptote is the maximum AmFRET value rather than 1. Therefore, we used the following equation for fitting:
<disp-formula id="eqn1">
<graphic xlink:href="533581v3_eqn1.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
Here Amp is the AmFRET asymptotic value of the curve, c is the concentration, C50<sub>seeded</sub> is the concentration at which the curve, in the presence of its self-seed, has reached 50% of its asymptotic value, and <italic>a</italic> describes the steepness of the stretched exponential. Initial values of the parameters were chosen based on Gaussian smoothed versions of the curves and constrained in the fit to at minimum a 2-fold change from those initial guesses. The <italic>a</italic> parameter was constrained between 0.1 and 10 based on expected reasonable values of that parameter. At low and high concentration values, the average AmFRET values are clearly unstable and influenced by noise and minor compensation errors. Therefore, we chose the beginning and ending points of each curve by visual inspection, choosing starting points where the curve begins to increase and ending points where the curve levels off. Error values were determined from Monte Carlo simulations as in the fitting of fraction assembly.</p>
<p>To approximate the supersaturability of DFDs, we used the ratio of the average C50 in the presence of the respective DFD’s seed (C50<sub>seeded</sub>) to the average C50 in the presence of a null-seed (C50<sub>stochastic</sub>). Ratios were only calculated between C50s obtained from the same batch run.</p>

The mEos3 signal was then background-subtracted with a rolling ball radius of 100 pixels then found and converted to Fiji ROIs using the Fiji Default method of traditional image thresholding. The mean, standard deviation, and aspect ratio (AR) were measured for each object. The coefficient of variation (CV) in pixel intensity was calculated for every object following the formula: CV = Std Dev/Mean*100. The wells were divided into 3 categories based on their AR and CV.

<title>Semidenaturating Detergent-Agarose Gel Electrophoresis (SDD-AGE)</title>
<p>SDD-AGE was performed as previously described.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup> Briefly, cells were lysed using a 2010 Geno/Grinder with bead-beating. Samples were prepared with 2% sarkosyl and separated in a 1.5% agarose gel with 0.1% SDS. The distribution of mEos3-fused proteins was analysed directly in the gel with a GE Typhoon Imaging System. Images were processed to remove background using a 250-pixel rolling ball, cropped, and contrast-adjusted.</p>

Illustration of how the library of all pairs of DFDs was created. An arrayed sublibrary of yeast transformed with 105 DFD-mEos3 fusions was mated to a separate arrayed sublibrary of yeast strains expressing 107 chromosomally integrated DFD-μNS-mCardinal fusions, to create a library of 12,660 diploid strains representing all pairwise combinations.</p><p>B. Left, DAmFRET was run on all pairwise combinations. Only high quality datasets –– having a total cell count greater or equal to 2500 and a mean acceptor intensity greater or equal to 3.5 p.d.u. –– were used in the analysis. Right, DAmFRET plots of FADD<sup>FL</sup> either null-seeded (lacking a DFD) or self-seeded. Nucleating interactions (as shown by the self-seeded example) are indicated by a reduced C50 and increased percentage of cells with self-assemblies (those above the gate delimiting low FRET, shown in orange).</p><p>C. Hits are determined by a multiparameter combination of the degree of C50 outlier and the degree of fraction assembled outlier as defined by how many interquartile ranges (IQR) a plot is below or above the median, respectively. Points on the graph are shaded by this parameter. The leftmost set of boxplots show the distribution of standardized log10 C50 and fraction assembled for all seeds for a representative protein, FADD<sup>FL</sup>. The middle boxplot shows the average outlier degree value of these two parameters. This value is referred to as “seedability” throughout the text and is used in determining hits. The cutoff value for hit determination was set to be 3 standard deviations above the mean of all seedability values across the screen. The scatter plot on the right shows the standardized log10 C50 and fraction assembled values, depicting the contribution of both to the scoring value and positive nucleating interactions within the green box.</p><p>D. Top, scatter plot of seedability values from the two replicate experiments containing 3478 DFD + seed combinations. Points are colored according to agreement between the two experiments. Gray rectangles indicate seedability values of negative interactions, with the dark gray square containing the interaction found to be negative for both instances. Bottom, the replicates after the removal of instances found to be negative in both experiments to reduce random and outlier effects. The line of best fit is shown in red. Pearson correlation R between the two experiments = 0.91 (p &lt; 0.0001). In order to reduce the effects of random variations of the negatives as well as outlier effects, we omitted double negative instances. In this case, the Pearson correlation R = 0.90 (p &lt; 0.0001).</p><p>E. Seventeen DFD + seed combinations that had inconsistent hit-calling out of the 3478 combinations reassessed. From this we determine that our assay had a consistency of 99.51% with a 95% confidence interval of 99.28 – 99.74%.</p><p>F. Bar plots showing the number of hits per experiment, as well as total number of hits, determined for each replicated DFD. Blue and yellow indicate separate hit counts for each experiment. Gray are the number of unique hits found across both experiments. What percentage of seeds are consistently called hits are shown for each DFD. The left bar plot shows the overall summary of all DFDs included in both sets.</p></caption>

            <title>Experiments to investigate the nature of DFD assembly</title>
            <p>DAmFRET data do not clarify if self-assembly involves native DFD interactions rather than amyloid-like misfolding.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup> To address this question, we introduced point mutations to disrupt assembly via conserved known interfaces between folded DFD subunits.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup> Across the multiple DFDs examined, all such mutations indeed reduced or eliminated the high-AmFRET population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Figure S2A</xref>). To directly evaluate the nature of DFD assembly in our experiments, we subjected the seeded and unseeded cells to semi-denaturing detergent-agarose gel electrophoresis (SDD-AGE), a technique that distinguishes amyloids from other protein states based on their detergent-resistance and size dispersity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">84</xref></sup> We found that unlike our amyloid control (RIPK1<sup>RHIM</sup>), none of the DFD assemblies survived sarkosyl exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Figure S2B</xref>), consistent with their retaining the death fold rather than misfolding into amyloid. Ongoing work is elucidating the physical basis of these nucleation barriers.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This is a high-quality and extensive study that reveals differences in the self-assembly properties of the full set of 109 human death fold domains (DFDs). Distributed amphifluoric FRET (DAmFRET) is a powerful tool that reveals the self-assembly behaviour of the DFDs, in non-seeded and seeded contexts, and allows comparison of the nature and extent of self-assembly. The nature of the barriers to nucleation is revealed in the transition from low to high AmFRET. Alongside analysis of the saturation concentration and protein concentration in the absence of seed, the subset of proteins that exhibited discontinuous transitions to higher-order assemblies was observed to have higher concentrations than DFDs that exhibited continuous transitions. The experiments probing the ~20% of DFDs that exhibit discontinuous transition to polymeric form suggest that they populate a metastable, supersaturated form in the absence of cognate signal. This is suggestive of a high intrinsic barrier to nucleation.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The differences in self-assembly behaviour are significant and likely identify mechanistic differences across this large family of signalling adapter domains. The work is of high quality, and the evidence for a range of behaviours is strong. This is an important and useful starting point since the different assembly mechanisms point towards specific cellular roles. However, understanding the molecular basis for these differences will require further analysis.</p>
<p>An impressive optogenetic approach was engineered and applied to initiate self-assembly of CASP1 and CASP9 DFDs, as a model for apoptosome initiation in these two DFDs with differing continuous or discontinuous assembly properties. This comparison revealed clear differences in the stability and reversibility of the assemblies, supporting the hypothesis that supersaturation-mediated DFD assembly underlies signal amplification in at least some of the DFDs.</p>
<p>The study reveals interesting correlations between supersaturation of DFD adapters in short- and long-lived cells, suggestive of a relationship between the mechanism of assembly and cellular context. Additionally, the comprehensive nature of the study provides strong evidence that the interactions are almost all homomeric or limited to members of the same DFD subfamily or interaction network. Similar approaches with bacterial proteins from innate immunity operons suggest that their polymerisation may be driven by similar mechanisms.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Only a limited investigation of assembly morphology was conducted by microscopy. There was a tendency for discontinuous structures to form fibrillar structures and continuous to populate diffuse or punctate structures, but there was overlap across all categories, which is not fully explored. The methodology used to probe oligomeric assembly and stability (SDD-AGE) does not justify the conclusions drawn regarding stability and native structure within the assemblies.</p>
<p>The work identifies important differences between DFDs and clearly different patterns of association. However, most of the detailed analysis is of the DFDs that exhibit a discontinuous transition, and important questions remain about the majority of other DFDs and why some assemblies should be reversible and others not, and about the nature of signalling arising from a continuous transition to polymeric form.</p>
<p>Some key examples of well-studied DFDs, such as MyD88 and RIPK,1 deserve more discussion, since they display somewhat surprising results. More detailed exploration of these candidates, where much is known about their structures and the nature of the assemblies from other work, could substantiate the conclusions here and transform some of the conclusions from speculative to convincing.</p>
<p>The study concludes with general statements about the relationship between stochastic nucleation and mortality, which provide food for thought and discussion but which, as they concede, are highly speculative. The analogies that are drawn with batteries and privatisation will likely not be clearly understood by all readers. The authors do not discuss limitations of the study or elaborate on further experiments that could interrogate the model.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The manuscript from Rodriguez Gama et al. proposes several interesting conclusions based on different oligomerization properties of Death-Fold Domains (DFDs) in cells, their natural abundance, and supersaturation properties. These ideas are:</p>
<p>
(1) DFDs broadly store the cell's energy by remaining in a supersaturated state;</p>
<p>
(2) Cells are constantly in a vulnerable state that could lead to cell death;</p>
<p>
(3) The cell's lifespan depends on the supersaturation levels of certain DFDs.</p>
<p>Overall, the evidence supporting these claims is not completely solid. Some concerns were noted.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Systematic analysis of DFD self-assembly and its relationship with protein abundance, supersaturation, cell longevity, and evolution.</p>
<p>Weaknesses</p>
<p>(1) On page 2, it is stated, &quot;Nucleation barriers increase with the entropic cost of assembly. Assemblies with large barriers, therefore, tend to be more ordered than those without. Ordered assembly often manifests as long filaments in cells,&quot; as a way to explain the observed results that DFDs assemblies that transitioned discontinuously form fibrils, whereas those that transitioned continuously (low-to-high) formed spherical or amorphous puncta. It is unlikely to be able to differentiate between amorphous and structured puncta by conventional confocal microscopy. Some DFDs self-assemble into structured puncta formed by intertwined fibrils. Such fibril nets are more structured and thus should be associated with a higher entropic cost. Therefore, the results in Figure 1B do not seem to agree with the reasoning described.</p>
<p>(2) Errors for the data shown in Figure 1B would have been very useful to determine whether the population differences between diffuse, punctate, and fibrillar for the continuous (low-to-high) transition are meaningful.</p>
<p>(3) A main concern in the data shown in Figure 1B and F is that the number of counts for discontinuous compared to continuous is small. Thus, the significance of the results is difficult to evaluate in the context of the broad function of DFDs as batteries, as stated at the beginning of the manuscript.</p>
<p>(4) The proteins or domains that are self-seeded (Figure 1F) should be listed such that the reader has a better understanding of whether domains or full-length proteins are considered, whether other domains have an effect on self-seeding (which is not discussed), and whether there is repetition.</p>
<p>(5) The authors indicate an anticorrelation between transcript abundance and Csat based on the data shown in Figure 2B; however, the data are scattered. It is not clear why an anticorrelation is inferred.</p>
<p>(6) It would be useful to indicate the expected range of degree centrality. The differences observed are very small. This is specifically the case for the BC values. The lack of context and the small differences cast doubts on their significance. It would be beneficial to describe these data in the context of the centrality values of other proteins.</p>
<p>(7) Page 3 section title: &quot;Nucleation barriers are a characteristic feature of inflammatory signalosome adaptors.&quot; This title seems to contradict the results shown in Figure 2D, where full-length CARD9 and CARD11 are classified as sensors, but it has been reported that they are adaptor proteins with key roles in the inflammatory response. Please see the following references as examples: The adaptor protein CARD9 is essential for the activation of myeloid cells through ITAM-associated and Toll-like receptors. Nat Immunol 8, 619-629 (2007), and Mechanisms of Regulated and Dysregulated CARD11 Signaling in Adaptive Immunity and Disease. Front Immunol. 2018 Sep 19;9:2105.</p>
<p>However, both CARD9 and CARD11 show discontinuous to continuous behavior for the individual DFDs versus full-length proteins, respectively, in contrast to the results obtained for ASC, FADD, etc. FADD plays a key role in apoptosis but shows the same behavior as BCL10 and ASC. However, the manuscript indicates that this behavior is characteristic of inflammatory signalosomes. What is the explanation for adaptor proteins behaving in different ways? This casts doubts about the possibility of deriving general conclusions on the significance of these observations, or the subtitles in the results section seem to be oversimplifications.</p>
<p>(8) IFI16-PYD displays discontinuous behavior according to Figure S1H; however, it is not included in Figure 2D, but AIM 2 is.</p>
<p>(9) To demonstrate that &quot;Nucleation barriers facilitate signal amplification in human cells,&quot; constructs using APAF1 CARD, NLRC4 CARD, caspase-9 CARD, and a chimera of the latter are used to create what the authors refer to as apoptsomes. Even though puncta are observed, referring to these assemblies as apoptosomes seems somewhat misleading. In addition, it is not clear why the activity of caspase-9 was not measured directly, instead of that of capsae-3 and 7, which could be activated by other means. The polymerization of caspase-1 CARD with NLRC4 CARD, leading to irreversible puncta, could just mean that the polymers are more stable. In fact, not all DFDs form equally stable or identical complexes, which does not necessarily imply that a nucleation barrier facilitates signal amplification. Could this conclusion be an overstatement?</p>
<p>(10) To demonstrate that &quot;Innate immune adaptors are endogenously supersaturated,&quot; it is stated on page 5 that ASC clusters continue to grow for the full duration of the time course and that AIM2-PYD stops growing after 5 min. The data shown in Figure 4F indicate that AIM2-PYD grows after 5 mins, although slowly, and ASC starts to slow down at ~ 13 min. Because ASC has two DFDs, assemblies can grow faster and become bigger. How is this related to supersaturation?</p>

<p>We appreciate constructive feedback from both reviewers. Reviewer 1 provided a very positive assessment and helpful suggestions for clarity, which we will incorporate.</p>
<p>We also thank Reviewer 2 for their detailed comments. In some instances, their public review raised concerns about specific data or interpretations that are, in fact, already presented and justified in the original manuscript. This feedback has highlighted a need to improve the clarity of our presentation.</p>
<p>In our revised manuscript, we will make key information more prominent to prevent further misunderstandings. We will also provide additional statistical validation for our conclusions, additional data from the optogenetic experiments and high throughput imaging, and further elaborate on the behaviors of specific proteins (FADD, MyD88, and RIPK1). We are confident that these revisions will make our findings more transparent and accessible to readers, and we look forward to submitting our revised manuscript.</p>
