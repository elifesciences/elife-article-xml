<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Neuronal energy regulation is increasingly recognized as a critical factor underlying brain functions and their pathological alterations, yet the metabolic dynamics that accompany cognitive processes remain poorly understood. As a label-free and minimally invasive technique, fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM) of coenzymes NADH and NADPH (collectively referred to as NAD(P)H) offers the possibility to resolve cellular metabolic profiles with high spatial precision. However, NAD(P)H FLIM’s capacity to detect subtle changes in neuronal metabolism associated with cognition has not been demonstrated. In this study, we applied NAD(P)H FLIM to map the metabolic profiles of <italic>Drosophila</italic> neurons in vivo across multiple scales, focusing on the primary centers for associative memory: the mushroom bodies (MBs). At a broad scale, we obtained an overview of the metabolic signatures of the main brain tissue and identified a marked difference between neuropil and cortex areas. At a finer scale, our findings revealed notable heterogeneity in the basal metabolic profiles of distinct MB neuron subtypes. Measurements performed after associative olfactory learning also uncovered a subtype-specific metabolic shift associated with memory formation, demonstrating the utility of NAD(P)H FLIM in detecting physiology-driven changes linked to brain function. These results establish a promising framework for studying cerebral energy dynamics in vivo.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Understanding the intricate relationship between brain function and energy metabolism is a fundamental challenge in neuroscience. Cellular metabolism relies on extremely conserved biochemical processes that sequentially catabolize primary energy substrates into usable energy in the form of ATP. These ubiquitous processes are especially active in the brain, which consumes large amounts of energy relative to its weight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Rolfe and Brown, 1997</xref>), mostly in the form of glucose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Sokoloff, 1999</xref>). Neurons indeed have high and dynamic energy needs, due in particular to the maintenance of ion gradients and the propagation of action potentials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Attwell and Laughlin, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>In vertebrates, astrocytes are major players in the achievement of this spatiotemporally fluctuating energy allocation. Astrocytes orchestrate the neurovascular coupling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Bélanger et al., 2011</xref>) but also store energy-carrying molecules and fuel them to neurons, thanks to their complementary metabolic profile. While neurons predominantly generate ATP through oxidative phosphorylation, astrocytes display a high level of glycolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Itoh et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Boumezbeur et al., 2010</xref>), resulting, for a significant fraction, in lactate production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Serres et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Bouzier-Sore et al., 2006</xref>). Numerous studies tend to demonstrate the net transfer of energy from astrocytes to neurons through a so-called lactate shuttle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Pellerin and Magistretti, 1994</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Bélanger et al., 2011</xref>). Despite some differences, accumulating evidence shows that insect glia shares many properties with its vertebrate counterparts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Nagai et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">De Backer and Grunwald Kadow, 2022</xref>), including their highly glycolytic profile and their ability to transfer glycolysis-derived metabolites to neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">Volkenhoff et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Rittschof and Schirmeier, 2018</xref>).</p>
<p>Additionally to the necessity of adapting energy supply to meet neuronal consumption, studies in diverse species, including insects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Chandrasekaran et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Plaçais et al., 2017</xref>) and rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Shimizu et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Parsons and Hirasawa, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">Suzuki et al., 2011</xref>), have shown that energy fluxes modulate higher brain functions. These findings support a shift away from a purely neurocentric perspective, suggesting that energy is not only delivered to neurons on demand but is instead regulated by an integrated neuron-glia network, actively shaping cerebral activity. Memory formation, in particular, has already been shown to be closely associated with neuronal energy regulation. Several studies have for example reported the importance of astrocytic metabolism during memory formation in vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Gibbs et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Newman et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">Suzuki et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Gao et al., 2016</xref>).</p>
<p>With its well-characterized genetics, neuroanatomy and memory capacities, <italic>Drosophila</italic> serves as an ideal model organism for investigating the neural basis of memory. Aversive olfactory memory can be induced in <italic>Drosophila</italic> through classical Pavlovian conditioning, by pairing an odor with electric shocks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">Tully and Quinn, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Modi et al., 2020</xref>). The neurons encoding these memories are located in the mushroom bodies (MBs), which are considered as the main brain center for associative memory in insects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Heisenberg, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Modi et al., 2020</xref>). The <italic>Drosophila</italic> MBs are paired structures including around 2,000 intrinsic neurons, named Kenyon cells (KCs), in each hemisphere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Aso et al., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Li et al., 2020</xref>). These neurons receive dendritic inputs from the antennal lobes in the MB calyces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Keller and Vosshall, 2003</xref>), located in the posterior part of the brain. Their axons form a bundle known as the peduncle, which extends to the anterior part of the brain before branching into horizontal and vertical lobes. KCs are categorized into three main subtypes based on their axonal morphology and genetic expression profile: α/β, α’/β’ and γ neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Crittenden et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Lee et al., 1999</xref>). All three populations are considered to be involved at multiple stages of memory processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Krashes et al., 2007</xref>), but converging evidence suggests that γ KCs are required for encoding and retrieving immediate memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Qin et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Bouzaiane et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Owald et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Perisse et al., 2016</xref>), while α/β neurons underlie a middle-term memory that develops more slowly over several hours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Blum et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Séjourné et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Bouzaiane et al., 2015</xref>).</p>
<p>Recent studies have underscored the importance of energy regulation in the MBs during memory formation. Increased mitochondrial energy flux in MB neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Plaçais et al., 2017</xref>) with precise spatiotemporal dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Comyn et al., 2024</xref>) and fueled by the transfer of glycolysis-derived alanine from cortex glia or astrocytes to neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Rabah et al., 2023</xref>) indeed play critical roles in the formation of middle-term and long-term memory. These findings position the <italic>Drosophila</italic> MBs as a compelling model for exploring how neuronal metabolism and cognitive processes intersect. In these works, metabolic dynamics in the MBs have been tracked using genetically encoded fluorescent sensors tracking specific metabolites.</p>
<p>The growing recognition of the role played by energy metabolism in brain function highlights the need for universal methods to monitor cellular metabolic profiles in vivo across species, with high spatial and temporal resolution. Cellular ATP production through catabolic pathways relies on redox reactions involving carbon-based energy substrates and redox couples, notably the coenzyme nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD), in its oxidized (NAD⁺) and reduced (NADH) forms. During glycolysis and the tricarboxylic acid cycle, NAD<sup>+</sup> is reduced to NADH, while NADH is oxidized back to NAD⁺ in the mitochondrial respiratory chain and through lactic acid fermentation. Since NADH is autofluorescent and NAD<sup>+</sup> is not, NADH fluorescence can serve as a proxy for the cellular redox state. In practice, NADH fluorescence is difficult to isolate from that of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH), a coenzyme involved in a wide range of anabolic processes. Nevertheless, shifts in the combined fluorescence signal of NADH and NADPH – referred to as NAD(P)H – are generally thought to be dominated by the influence of the NADH in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Kasischke et al., 2004</xref>). Fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM) enables differentiation between free and protein-bound NAD(P)H molecules based on their distinct fluorescence lifetimes. Free NAD(P)H exhibits a shorter lifetime – around 0.4 ns – while bound NAD(P)H has a longer lifetime, ranging from 1 to 5 ns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Lakowicz et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Kolenc and Quinn, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Datta et al., 2020</xref>). By analyzing the contributions of these distinct lifetimes to the overall fluorescence decay, FLIM provides a quantitative estimate of the relative concentrations of free and bound NAD(P)H, robust to intensity distortion caused by light scattering. The free-to-bound NAD(P)H ratio measured by FLIM has been linked to changes in the balance between glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), with a higher proportion of free NAD(P)H indicating an increased reliance on glycolysis relative to OXPHOS, and vice versa. This relationship has been observed in vitro and ex vivo in various contexts, including metabolic perturbations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93">Zheng et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Stringari et al., 2012b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Drozdowicz-Tomsia et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Liu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">Yang et al., 2021</xref>), cell differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Guo et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Stringari et al., 2012a</xref>) and carcinogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Bird et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Skala et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Rück et al., 2014</xref>), underscoring the utility of FLIM in assessing cellular metabolic states.</p>
<p>In the present study, we propose to demonstrate that NAD(P)H FLIM can capture the metabolic heterogeneities and shifts underpinning memory formation in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> brain. In contrast with hypothesis-driven approaches that rely on metabolite-specific sensors, NAD(P)H autofluorescence provides a global readout of cellular metabolism. Furthermore, autofluorescence imaging can be applied in non-genetic experimental models where genetically encoded indicators cannot be introduced. As a label-free and minimally invasive technique, NAD(P)H FLIM holds great promise for profiling neuronal metabolism in vivo. Despite this potential, its application to the brain has been so far limited. It has been used in vivo in the rodent brain to monitor strong and widespread metabolic responses to anoxia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">Yaseen et al., 2013</xref>) and pharmacological interventions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c92">Yaseen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Gómez et al., 2018</xref>)). However, its capacity to detect more subtle metabolic events associated with cognitive processes remains to be established.</p>
<p>Here, we employed FLIM of NAD(P)H to map the in vivo metabolic profiles of <italic>Drosophila</italic> neurons across multiple scales – from a broad view of the central brain to individual KC subtypes. This approach allowed us to visualize the cerebral metabolic heterogeneity at different levels and to identify a memory-related metabolic shift within a specific KC subtype. Our findings contribute to the understanding of the fine-scale energy regulation taking place in the MBs and establish NAD(P)H FLIM as a promising framework for future investigations into the energy dynamics underlying cognition.</p>

<title>Metabolic landscape of the central brain highlights tissue-specific signatures</title>
<p>For this novel application of FLIM, we began by mapping the metabolic landscape across the entire <italic>Drosophila</italic> central brain, with a particular focus on the mushroom bodies (MBs). We conducted in vivo two-photon imaging of NAD(P)H FLIM over the entire central brain in flies expressing a DsRed cytosolic marker in MB neurons (MB-DsRed; Dataset 1 in Methods). Multi-exponential fitting and phasor analysis constitute the main approaches for NAD(P)H FLIM decay characterization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Digma et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Stringari et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Kolenc and Quinn, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Schaefer et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Datta et al., 2020</xref>). The former was chosen to automatically extract quantitative metabolic indicators. Given the novelty of the application, we opted for a simple and well-grounded approach to modeling NAD(P)H decays: the bi-exponential model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Kolenc and Quinn, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Schaefer et al., 2019</xref>). The decay curves were spatially binned to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1a</xref>). A bi-exponential model was fitted to each decay using maximum-likelihood estimation (Sup. Figure 1), generating local estimates of the free NAD(P)H fraction – f<sub>free</sub> – and the protein-bound NAD(P)H lifetime – τ<sub>bound</sub> – across the central brain, for each fly. The weighted mean lifetime – τ<sub>mean</sub> – was subsequently computed from these estimates.</p>
<p>The 3D spatial distributions of NAD(P)H properties could be visualized over the volume of the central brain (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1b</xref> and Sup. Movies). This mapping revealed the distinct metabolic fingerprints of large anatomical structures. In particular, the neuropil could be well distinguished from the cortex region, which contains neuronal somata and cortex glia, as it displayed higher f<sub>free</sub> and lower τ<sub>bound</sub> values. Within the neuropil, layers with lower f<sub>free</sub> and higher τ<sub>bound</sub> values stood out, delineating different regions, as visible on the τ<sub>mean</sub> map. Based on qualitative visual evaluation, these structures likely correspond to the layers formed by processes of neuropil- and tract-ensheathing glia, as well as tracheal processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Pereanu et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Kremer et al., 2017</xref>).</p>
<p>To quantitatively compare the different MB regions, we coarsely segmented the labeled MB image into defined anatomical structures using thresholding of the MB-specific fluorescent red marker and manually defined separation planes. Due to the limited resolution of the cytosolic marker image at this scale, the cortical region of the MB, primarily consisting of KC somata enveloped by cortex glia, could not be isolated from the adjacent calyx, which contains KC neurites and axonal projections from external neurons. The resulting segmentation included the peduncle, the medial lobes and the vertical lobe and the posterior part of the MB, consisting of the cortical region and calyx (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1d</xref>).</p>
<p>The obtained segmentation enabled region-specific extraction of FLIM voxels, followed by the estimation of corresponding decay parameters. f<sub>free</sub> and τ<sub>bound</sub> distributions were predominantly unimodal (Sup. Figure 2), allowing for effective representation by the mean. No significant variation in the average f<sub>free</sub> was observed across regions (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1e</xref>, left). However, the posterior region showed notably higher τ<sub>bound</sub> values than the rest of the MB (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1e</xref>, right), consistent with what was observed at the whole brain level.</p>
<p>Overall, these results highlight regional differences in f<sub>free</sub> and τ<sub>bound</sub> among the neuropil, the cortex region and ensheathing glia in the central brain. At the MB level, a difference in τ<sub>bound</sub> was still observed between the posterior part of the MB and purely synaptic regions. The interpretation of f<sub>free</sub> as an indicator of the glycolysis-to-OXPHOS ratio has theoretical support (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Schaefer et al., 2019</xref>) and has been validated in various contexts (see Introduction). The interpretation of τ<sub>bound</sub> is more complex, as it is generally thought to represent a weighted average of fluorescence lifetimes of different enzyme-bound NAD(P)H species and to be influenced by changes in the composition of the proteins binding to NAD(P)H molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Kasischke et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">Yaseen et al., 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c92">2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Evers et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Sharick et al., 2018</xref>). Some studies also suggested that τ<sub>bound</sub> variations may more sensitively reflect changes in the NADPH/NADH ratio than in NAD(P)H binding state, with τ<sub>bound</sub> being positively correlated to the NADPH/NADH ratio (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Blacker et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Blacker and Duchen, 2016</xref>). Here, the difference between neuropil and cortical regions seems to be more strongly reflected by τ<sub>bound</sub> than f<sub>free</sub>, as confirmed by the quantitative analysis in the MBs, suggesting differences between these tissues in the composition of the proteins binding to NAD(P)H and/or in the NADPH/NADH ratio.</p>

<title>Somata and calyx regions have different metabolic profiles</title>
<p>The neuropil region of the MB – comprising the calyx, peduncle and lobes – contains KC neurites and is innervated by numerous additional neuronal types, including projection neurons, dopaminergic neurons, and MB output neurons as well as broadly-innervating DPM and APL neurons, which complicates the attribution of observed metabolic signals to particular cells. Isolating the NAD(P)H signal from the MB cortical region thus allows for the specific characterization of KC somata’s metabolic profile and its comparison with that of the adjacent synaptic region.</p>
<p>To this end, we acquired images with a more restrained scope, centered on the cortical area of the MBs. Each acquisition captured the KC-specific cytosolic marker MB-DsRed and NAD(P)H FLIM in a single hemisphere (Dataset 2 in Methods). We analyzed these images using mapping tools derived from other datasets: a MB template (Sup. Figure 3) and two segmentation masks, designed to isolate the KC somata and the calyx, respectively (Sup. Figure 4). The template image, designed to represent the average shape of the posterior MB region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Avants et al., 2010</xref>), was derived from a set of 165 MB-DsRed images (Dataset 3 in Methods) using a 3D volume registration procedure consisting of affine and non linear diffeomorphic transformations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Avants et al., 2008</xref>). A common template was established for left and right hemisphere MBs after confirming that their average shape differences were minimal (Sup. Figure 5). The masks were derived from MB-DsRed images and KC-specific nuclear marker images (Dataset 3 and Dataset 4 in Methods), using the same registration method. Once registered to each image, the masks enabled us to select the regions of interest in the FLIM image (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2a</xref>). Decay parameters were then extracted as previously.</p>
<p>Registration was further used to project decay parameter images to the template space, enabling the generation of an average map of f<sub>free</sub> and τ<sub>bound</sub> in the cortical region and calyx (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2b</xref> and Sup. Figure 6a) while minimizing the impact of inter-individual anatomical variations. This map was obtained by pooling left and mirrored right hemisphere images, after confirming that there was no hemisphere-specific spatial distribution of f<sub>free</sub> (see Supplementary information and Sup. Figure 7). This average map highlighted that f<sub>free</sub> was consistently higher in the calyx neuropil than in the cortical region of the MB.</p>
<p>To quantitatively substantiate this observation, the within-subject average was computed using both hemisphere images when available, or a single hemisphere image otherwise. The results confirmed that the calyx exhibits significantly higher values of f<sub>free</sub> than the KC somata region, with means of 0.75 and 0.68, respectively (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2b</xref>, bottom right). According to the literature, the difference in f<sub>free</sub> likely reflects a higher reliance on glycolysis relative to OXPHOS in the calyx. Similar analysis of τ<sub>bound</sub> revealed a significantly shorter bound-NAD(P)H lifetime in the calyx compared to the somata region (Sup. Figure 6b). This difference in τ<sub>bound</sub> is consistent with the previously observed trends between the posterior region and the rest of the MB and, at a larger scale, between cortex and neuropil in general. Likewise, it could reflect differences in protein composition and/or in the NADPH/NADH ratio.</p>
<p>Measures of f<sub>free</sub> and τ<sub>bound</sub> were notably anticorrelated in the posterior part of the MB (Sup. Figure 8). The anticorrelation between these parameters can be qualitatively observed in several studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Bird et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Skala et al., 2007</xref>; Wetzker and Reinhardt, 2019; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">Yang et al., 2021</xref>). Multi-exponential fitting has been reported to potentially introduce artificial correlations between parameter estimates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Grinvald and Steinberg, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Johnson, 2000</xref>). Through simulation, we confirmed that the relationship observed in our data was not an artifact of the fitting process (see Supplementary information and Sup. Figure 9), supporting the hypothesis of its biological origin.</p>

Next, we used a MB template with previously defined masks delineating the KC somata region (purple) and the calyx (turquoise). This template was registered to the segmented marker image. The registered masks could be used to isolate the target area (the somata region in this illustration) in the FLIM image.

<title>Memory formation does not induce a significant metabolic shift over the MB somata and calyx regions</title>
<p>After imaging basal metabolism in the posterior MB region, we investigated whether memory formation induced detectable metabolic changes To this end, we acquired images of the MB posterior region in conditioned flies (refer to Dataset 5 in Methods). Flies were subjected to a classical olfactory aversive learning protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">Tully and Quinn, 1985</xref>). In this paradigm, flies are exposed simultaneously to an odorant (odor A) and a train of electric footshocks, and then to another odorant without shocks (odor B; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2c</xref>, top). Following one such training session, it is known that flies develop short-(STM) and middle-term memory (MTM) in the form of learned avoidance of odor A compared to odor B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Margulies et al., 2005</xref>). Control flies were subjected to unpaired conditioning, consisting of an exposure to the aversive stimulus and then to both odors, sequentially. No significant difference of the within-subject averages of f<sub>free</sub> were observed in the somata or calyx regions between conditioned and control flies (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2c</xref>, bottom). Similarly, no memory-associated shifts in τ<sub>bound</sub> were detected in either region (Sup. Figure 6c).</p>
<p>In this experiment, indicators derived from NAD(P)H FLIM did not reveal a significant metabolic shift affecting globally the KC somata region or the calyx after a single training cycle. This result suggests the absence of an overall metabolic shift in these regions or its low amplitude relative to NAD(P)H FLIM sensitivity. Alternatively, specific effects may be diluted or averaged out, as the analyzed areas encompass diverse cell types that could exhibit distinct memory-related metabolic dynamics.</p>

<title>KC subtypes have different basal metabolic profiles</title>
<p>To further explore the metabolic heterogeneity of the MB, we aimed at characterizing the basal metabolism of the main subtypes of KCs (α/β, α’/β’ and γ). These subpopulations are known to have distinct functional roles. In particular, α/β neurons are specifically involved in middle- and long-term memories, whose formation has been shown to critically depend on energy regulation, while γ neurons are more specifically involved in short-term memory.</p>
<p>We initially attempted to separate subtype contributions within images through a mapping approach. To this end, we computed the average spatial distribution of each of these subtypes within the somata region of the template image (Sup. Figure 10a). While anatomical maps of the MB neuropil have shown that the neurites of different KC subtypes form distinct bundles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Aso et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Li et al., 2020</xref>), the stereotypy of KC somata distribution remained largely unexplored. Our analysis revealed that these distributions were spatially non-uniform and reproducible from one group of flies to another (see Supplementary information and Sup. Figure 10bc). Comparisons of pairs of images from identical or different hemispheres revealed an absence of lateralization of the spatial distribution of the neuronal subtypes (see Supplementary information and Sup. Figure 11). However, the degree of overlap between the average subtype distributions was high (Sup. Figure 10de), suggesting important inter-individual variations and making effective separation through segmentation masks impossible.</p>
<p>We therefore performed recording in flies, expressing a nuclear marker in either α/β, α’/β’ or γ neurons, to separately measure the metabolic profile of each subpopulation while minimizing the contribution of the surrounding tissues. For each fly, standard two-photon imaging of this marker was performed alongside NAD(P)H FLIM over the somata region of the MB, one hemisphere at a time (Dataset 6 in Methods). Nuclear marker images were used to isolate the fluorescence decays around the somata of the marked neuronal subtype (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3a</xref>). Within-subject averages of f<sub>free</sub> were then computed from the masked FLIM images. These measurements revealed that the KC subtypes exhibit different basal metabolic profiles. Indeed, α/β, α’/β’ and γ somata displayed decreasing f<sub>free</sub> values of 0.73, 0.71 and 0.70, respectively, with statistical testing showing a significant difference between α/β and γ subtypes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3b</xref>). Considering τ<sub>bound</sub>, no statistically significant difference was observed between the three subtypes (Sup. Figure 12a).</p>
<p>Contrarily from previously observed regional differences, KC subtypes differed on f<sub>free</sub> but not on τ<sub>bound</sub>. This suggests, in line with the established interpretation of f<sub>free</sub>, that the basal metabolism of α/β neurons rely more heavily on glycolysis relative to OXPHOS than that of γ neurons. We conducted an initial investigation to determine whether the lower f<sub>free</sub> values observed in γ neurons could be attributed to a higher reliance on lactate-to-pyruvate conversion catalyzed by lactate dehydrogenase (Ldh) rather than pyruvate production by glycolysis, as Ldh was recently shown to be preferentially expressed in γ KCs as compared to other KC subtypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Raun et al., 2023</xref>). However, we found no significant differences in f<sub>free</sub> between Ldh-knockdown flies and controls (Dataset 7 in Methods and Sup. Figure 13).</p>
<p>This experiment provides initial insights into the metabolic heterogeneity of KC subtypes. Due to the limitations of the segmentation, it should be noted that our observations of the KC somata of a given subtype could partially include the surrounding glial processes.</p>

<title>Memory formation induces a metabolic shift in α/β KCs</title>
<p>After establishing the basal metabolic profiles of KC subtypes, we sought to measure the influence of memory formation on specific subtypes. We imaged the MB cortical region in conditioned flies expressing subtype-specific nuclear markers (Dataset 8 and Dataset 9 in Methods). We focused on α/β and γ neurons, which have been reported to support the formation of MTM and STM, respectively, following a single training cycle. Our analysis showed that flies exposed to paired training exhibited significantly lower f<sub>free</sub> values compared to controls around α/β somata (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3c</xref>). In contrast, the average f<sub>free</sub> value in γ somata appeared unaffected by the type of conditioning.

<p>These experiments demonstrated the capability of NAD(P)H FLIM to detect subtle physiological alterations of cellular metabolism induced by memory formation. Moreover, the results indicate that distinct metabolic dynamics unfold in α/β and γ neurons after aversive conditioning.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we sought to demonstrate the potential of NAD(P)H FLIM for detecting physiologically relevant spatiotemporal dynamics in brain energy metabolism. By applying this technique to the central brain of <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, we uncovered new insights into cellular metabolic heterogeneity. To establish this novel application, we employed bi-exponential fitting to extract two key parameters: the free fraction of NAD(P)H (f<sub>free</sub>) and the lifetime of enzyme-bound NAD(P)H (τ<sub>bound</sub>). Using genetically encoded anatomical markers combined with registration tools, these parameters were measured across different brain regions.</p>
<p>On a broad scale, our findings revealed the distinct metabolic profiles of ensheathing glial layers, cortical areas and neuropil regions, with τ<sub>bound</sub> being particularly discriminative of the neuropil and cortex. At the MB level, differences between KC somata and calyx regions were observed in both τ<sub>bound</sub> and f<sub>free</sub>. At a finer scale, significant basal and memory-induced differences were detected in f<sub>free</sub> among KC subtypes, whereas changes in τ<sub>bound</sub> remained limited. These patterns suggest that tissue-level differences are primarily reflected by τ<sub>bound</sub>, whereas subtype-specific variations among KCs are predominantly captured by f<sub>free</sub>.</p>
<p>As FLIM-based metabolic measurements are influenced by numerous factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Schaefer et al., 2019</xref>), the interpretation of these parameters in this novel context remains multifaceted. While f<sub>free</sub> is often considered a reliable indicator of the glycolysis-to-OXPHOS balance, τ<sub>bound</sub> is thought to reflect a broader range of factors, including the composition of proteins binding to NAD(P)H and the NADPH/NADH ratio. The tissue-level differences dominated by τ<sub>bound</sub>, such as those observed between the posterior MB and other regions (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1e</xref>), likely reflect broad metabolic distinctions that extend beyond energy-related processes. In contrast, the differences in f<sub>free</sub> between KC subtypes may more reliably indicate distinct reliance on glycolysis versus OXPHOS. Instances where both f<sub>free</sub> and τ<sub>bound</sub> differ strongly – such as between the KC somata and calyx (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2b</xref>, Sup. Figure 6a and Sup. Figure 8b) – might result from a combination of these factors. Measures of f<sub>free</sub> and τ<sub>bound</sub> in the posterior part of the MB and within KC subtypes were notably anticorrelated (Sup. Figure 8). We found, via simulation, that this anticorrelation was not an artifact of the fitting process, supporting the existence of a biological dependence between both parameters in our data (see Supplementary information and Sup. Figure 9).</p>
<p>At the level of KC subtypes, we found that α/β neurons exhibited higher f<sub>free</sub> values than γ neurons, suggesting a higher glycolysis-to-OXPHOS ratio in α/β neurons. Ldh has been reported to be more expressed in γ neurons compared to the other KC subtypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Raun et al., 2023</xref>), leading us to hypothesize that lactate-to-pyruvate conversion by Ldh reduces the glycolytic demand in this subtype. A knockdown of Ldh in γ neurons was conducted as a preliminary investigation but no significant impact on f<sub>free</sub> was observed. Disentangling the contributions of KC somata and surrounding cortex glia to the FLIM signal, potentially through co-labeling approaches, could deepen our understanding of the basal metabolic heterogeneity among KC subtypes.</p>
<p>Notably, we observed a decrease in f<sub>free</sub> in α/β somata – and surrounding glial processes – following a single aversive conditioning session, with no corresponding change in γ neurons. This reduction may reflect a transition towards OXPHOS in α/β somata during memory formation or maintenance. Although single-session memory training primarily induces the encoding of labile STM in γ neurons, parallel processes in α/β neurons lead to the formation of longer-persisting MTM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Blum et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Séjourné et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Bouzaiane et al., 2015</xref>). Our observation of a metabolic shift specific to α/β neurons aligns with recent evidence showing increased mitochondrial activity in KCs during MTM formation, supported by alanine transfer from glia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Rabah et al., 2023</xref>).</p>
<p>While interpretations of the observed NAD(P)H state variations in this new context remain open-ended, our findings lay a solid foundation for developing hypotheses about energy regulation in the MBs. This novel application of NAD(P)H FLIM can be extended in numerous ways, to probe the metabolic dynamics of memory formation across different conditions, resolutions and timescales. This approach also holds promise for investigating the role of metabolic dysregulation in age-related cognitive decline and neurodegenerative diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Saitoe et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Camandola and Mattson, 2017</xref>). More broadly, it offers a powerful tool to advance fundamental neuroenergetic research, deepening our understanding of the interplay between energy metabolism and brain function.</p>

All data acquisition and analysis was performed with the Leica LAS-X (v3.5.7) software. 3D z-stacks were acquired either on the whole brain, or on the cortex region encompassing all Kenyon cells. The number of planes in the z-dimension was adjusted to include all visible KCs somata. The excitation laser intensity was adjusted with LAS-X controls to 14% corresponding to ∼9 mW at the objective output. On each x-y plane, 30 sequential scans were averaged, yielding on average 150-300 photons per pixel.</p>

<title>Segmentation of fluorescence intensity images for FLIM masking</title>
<p>For Dataset 1, each image was initially divided into two halves along a manually defined median plane, enabling separate processing of both hemispheres. The somata and calyx region was roughly isolated from each image using manually defined planes orthogonal to the Y axis. A binary mask of this region was then obtained through Li thresholding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Li and Tam, 1998</xref>) after Gaussian smoothing (with a standard deviation σ = 4 µm). In each single-hemisphere image, the entire MB was delineated by applying Li thresholding after Gaussian smoothing (σ = 2 µm). The peduncle and lobes were first roughly isolated using manually defined planes, orthogonal to the main axes. Binary masks for these regions were then created using smoothing (σ = 2 µm) and Otsu thresholding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Otsu, 1979</xref>). Finally, all single-hemisphere masks were combined to reconstruct complete brain masks.</p>
<p>Images of Dataset 2 and Dataset 5 were segmented by applying Li thresholding after Gaussian smoothing (σ = 2 µm) and keeping only the largest contiguous volume.</p>
<p>Images of Dataset 6, Dataset 7, Dataset 8 and Dataset 9 were segmented in two steps. First, Li thresholding was applied after Gaussian smoothing (σ = 0.5 µm) and only the volumes superior to 1 µm<sup>3</sup> were kept. Then, Li thresholding was applied again within the resulting non-zero voxels.</p>

<title>FLIM image processing</title>
<p>We observed that voxels with exceptionally high photon counts were predominantly associated with tracheas or with objects outside the region of interest due to the limitations of the segmentations. To reduce the influence of these artifacts while preserving the neuronal signal, we excluded voxels with photon counts exceeding <italic>Q<sub>3</sub></italic> + 3 × <italic>IQR</italic>, where <italic>Q<sub>3</sub></italic> represents the upper quartile of the count distribution and <italic>IQR</italic> denotes the interquartile range.</p>
<p>To ensure that the total photon counts of the decay histograms were sufficient for reliable curve fitting, the signals of neighboring voxels were combined. This process, known as spatial binning, enhances the signal-to-noise ratio of the decay signal at the cost of reducing spatial resolution. Decay histograms were summed within a disk centered on each voxel. This disk was defined as a 5 x 5 x 1 voxel volume, with the four corner voxels excluded. To avoid unreliable modeling of the decays, voxels for which the total photon count did not exceed 500 after binning were excluded from further analyses.</p>
<p>Theoretical fluorescence decays were modeled using the following bi-exponential function <italic>D</italic>:
<disp-formula>
<graphic xlink:href="635185v1_ueqn1.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula>
where <italic>f<sub>free</sub></italic> is the free NAD(P)H fraction, <italic>τ<sub>free</sub></italic>is the free NAD(P)H lifetime and <italic>τ<sub>bound</sub></italic> is the protein-bound NAD(P)H lifetime. The measured decays were fitted with the following function <italic>f</italic>, which incorporates the theoretical decay and the effects of the measurement process:
<disp-formula>
<graphic xlink:href="635185v1_ueqn2.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula>
where <italic>IRF</italic> is the microscope impulse response function, <italic>Δt</italic> is the temporal shift between the IRF and the measured signal and <italic>T</italic> is the laser period. The modeled signal at time <italic>t</italic> takes into account the fluorescence caused by the last laser pulse (term for <italic>p</italic> = 0) as well as the previous one (term for <italic>p</italic> = 1), as proposed by (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Klemm et al., 2015</xref>). (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Klemm et al., 2015</xref>).</p>
<p>In practice, <italic>f</italic> was evaluated for N<sub>t</sub> = 129 time steps <italic>t<sub>i</sub></italic> corresponding to the time bins of the FLIM data and normalized:
<disp-formula>
<graphic xlink:href="635185v1_ueqn3.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula>
The final simulated decay sequence <italic>s</italic> was defined as:
<disp-formula>
<graphic xlink:href="635185v1_ueqn4.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula>
where <italic>b</italic> is a constant background noise.</p>
<p>The IRF was obtained from each image using the FALCON module of the Leica LAS X software managing FLIM acquisitions (v3.5.7). <italic>T</italic> was set to 12.5 ns, corresponding to the 80 MHz repetition rate of the microscope laser. Due to its limited physiological interpretability and its narrow reported range of variation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Guo et al., 2008</xref>), <italic>τ<sub>free</sub></italic>was fixed at 0.4 ns, in line with values reported in the literature for aqueous solutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Scott et al., 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">Visser and van Hoek, 1981</xref>), cell cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">Wu et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Rück et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Sharick et al., 2018</xref>), tissue slices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">Vishwasrao et al., 2005</xref>), in vivo experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">Yaseen et al., 2013</xref>), as well as in our own findings (Sup. Figure 14).</p>
<p>Parameters <italic>f<sub>free</sub></italic>, <italic>τ<sub>bound</sub></italic>, <italic>Δt</italic> and <italic>b</italic> were estimated via maximum-likelihood estimation (MLE), using the 2<italic>I</italic>* quality parameter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Maus et al., 2001</xref>):
<disp-formula>
<graphic xlink:href="635185v1_ueqn5.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula>
where <italic>m<sub>i</sub></italic> represents the measured photon count in bin i and C represents the total photon count of the measured decay (i.e the sum of <italic>m<sub>i</sub></italic> values). MLE was preferred over the least squares method for its higher reported accuracy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Maus et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Laurence and Chromy, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Chen et al., 2022</xref>).</p>
<p>This fitting process was implemented using the Nelder-Mead algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Gao and Han, 2012</xref>). Each curve fitting was repeated 5 times, using initialization parameters uniformly sampled from empirically defined ranges. The parameter estimation having returned the lowest 2I* value was selected. Voxels with final 2I* values exceeding the empirically defined threshold of 200 were systematically excluded from further analysis (Sup. Figure 1).</p>
<p>To accelerate the estimation for all voxels of an image, a two-step process was carried out. An initial fitting was computed on a downsampled version of the image, which had been decimated by a factor of 3 in the X and Y directions. The time shift <italic>Δt</italic> was then fixed to the median of the obtained values, enabling the application of a streamlined three-parameter model to the complete image.</p>
<p>In the end, we considered that the metabolic profile extracted from a given decay curve is constituted of the couple (<italic>f<sub>free</sub></italic>, <italic>τ<sub>bound</sub></italic>). The mean lifetime was optionally computed as the sum of the free and bound NAD(P)H lifetimes weighted by their fractional contributions:
<disp-formula>
<graphic xlink:href="635185v1_ueqn6.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula>
Analysis of the spatial distributions revealed that voxels with <italic>f<sub>free</sub></italic>values below 0.25 consistently fell outside the regions of interest as a result of imperfect segmentation. Consequently, these voxels were systematically excluded from further analysis.</p>

<title>Building a template image of the somata and calyx region</title>
<p>A template image of the somata region of the MB was generated from the 165 KC-specific cytosolic marker channel of the images (Dataset 3). The preprocessing steps for these images are outlined in Sup. Figure 3a. Images were resampled to an isotropic voxel size of 0.5 µm in all directions. To eliminate background noise and extraneous bright objects, we applied Li thresholding to a smoothed version of each image, retaining only the brightest contiguous object. The images were cropped and padded to make their size uniform and to center them based on their center of mass. The average intensity histogram of the dataset was computed by averaging the intensity histograms of all images. The intensity of all images were normalized by adjusting their intensity histogram to match the dataset’s average histogram (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Nyúl et al., 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>The template was subsequently constructed from the preprocessed images using the symmetric group-wise normalization algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Avants et al., 2010</xref>). The registration method used in the procedure was defined as a sequence of rigid, affine and diffeomorphic transformations applied to the 3D volumetric images. Symmetric normalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Avants et al., 2008</xref>) was used as the diffeomorphic transformation, with empirically defined parameters of 0.2 for the gradient step, 3 for the update field smoothing and 1 for the displacement field smoothing. The method initializes the template as the mean image and then iteratively updates it to minimize the average displacement required to register the dataset to the template (Sup. Figure 3b). The template image associated with the lowest average displacement after 8 iterations was selected. The template was finally refined by applying thresholding and centering. The final template image is shown in Sup. Figure 3cd.</p>

<title>Building masks for the somata and calyx region</title>
<p>A mask isolating the somata region was derived from the images of Dataset 4, obtained by simultaneously capturing KC-specific nuclear and cytosolic markers on two separate channels. This set of images was registered to the previously established MB template (Sup. Figure 4) using the cytosolic marker channel. The nuclear marker channels were warped using the obtained transformations and then averaged. The somata region mask was obtained by binarizing the result. The binarization used the highest threshold obtained through the application of the 3-class multi-Otsu algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Liao et al., 2001</xref>) after Gaussian smoothing (σ = 3 µm).</p>
<p>A mask isolating the calyx region was derived by binarizing the MB template image. The binarization used the highest threshold obtained through the application of the 3-class multi-Otsu algorithm after Gaussian smoothing (σ = 5 µm). The final calyx mask was refined by excluding the voxels included in the somata mask.</p>

<title>Mapping f<sub>free</sub> in the somata and calyx region</title>
<p>Single-hemisphere maps of f<sub>free</sub> were obtained from Dataset 2. Right-side images were mirrored to allow their superposition with left hemisphere images. The MB template was registered to each image. This transformation was applied to the chosen mask (somata or calyx) using nearest-neighbor interpolation. The warped mask was applied to select the region of interest in the FLIM image. Spatial binning and curve fitting was applied to the masked FLIM image, resulting in maps of the decay parameters over the region of interest.</p>
<p>To map decay parameters in the template space, the KC-specific marker channel (MB-DsRed) of the image was registered to the template. This deformation was applied to the maps of decay parameters using nearest-neighbor interpolation. The average f<sub>free</sub> map presented in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2b</xref> was obtained by averaging all registered parameters maps.</p>

<title>The template image minimizes displacement upon registration</title>
<p>We confirmed that registering the images to the template image resulted in less displacement compared to registration to either the average image or to randomly selected images (Sup. Figure 3ef). This finding supports the use of the template image as a reference space to minimize deformation during registration.</p>

<title>Minimal differences in hemisphere-specific MB shapes</title>
<p>We compared templates generated from left, right or both hemispheres images of the somata region of the MBs (Sup. Figure 5a). Differences between left- and right-specific template images were consistently higher than differences obtained using mixed hemispheres (Sup. Figure 5b). As the subset size increased, this effect became stronger. For subsets of 30 images, the average differences were 11.7% and 14.4% for inter-hemisphere and mixed-hemisphere comparisons, respectively. This result suggests the existence of a slight difference in shape between left and right MBs. We concluded upon visual inspection that this putative difference was too subtle to justify the use of separate templates (Sup. Figure 5cd).</p>

<title>The spatial distributions of KC subtype somata are not hemisphere-specific</title>
<p>We compared the spatial distributions of the somata of KC subtypes in images of Dataset 3. Using pairs of MB images coming from different subjects, the distances between left and right hemispheres were not significantly different from the intra-hemisphere differences (Sup. Figure 11). This result indicated that the subtype distributions are not hemisphere specific. This analysis also showed that distances between left and right α/β distributions were lower when they came from the same subject.</p>

<title>Somata of KC subtypes have specific spatial distributions</title>
<p>We tested whether the average spatial distribution of the somata of each KC subtype was specific, using images of Dataset 3 featuring a KC-specific marker channel and a subtype-specific marker channel. Image subsets of increasing size were used to compare the average spatial distributions of the different subtypes (Sup. Figure 10b). Average distributions from images of the same subtype consistently showed greater similarity than to those from different subtypes (Sup. Figure 10c). When using 20 images per spatial distribution, the average differences were 8.1%, 13.5% and 13.1% for intra-α/β, intra-α’/β’ and intra-γ comparisons, respectively, and 19.4% for inter-type comparisons. This result demonstrates that the spatial distribution of KC somata is subtype-specific.</p>

<sec id="s5a5">
<title>The average spatial distributions of KC subtypes are highly overlapping</title>
<p>We have shown that the average spatial distributions of the somata of KC subtypes were different. These distributions can be visualized through the subtype proportion map (Sup. Figure 10d). As can be observed from the color scale of this map, the proportions of each subtype vary within specific ranges: 20-70%, 10-40% and 10-60% for α/β, α’/β’ and γ, respectively. When looking at the distributions of the proportions, we observe that in most voxels, the proportion of a given subtype corresponds to the overall fraction of neurons belonging to this subtype (Sup. Figure 10e). This shows that although the distributions are non-uniform, the high inter-subject variability prevents the delineation of areas that consistently isolate specific neuronal subtypes across individual flies.</p>

<p>We compared the spatial distributions of f<sub>free</sub> in images of Dataset 2. Using pairs of MB images coming from different subjects, the distances between left and right hemispheres were not significantly different from the intra-hemisphere differences (Sup. Figure 7). This result indicated that the subtype distributions are not hemisphere specific.</p>

<title>The anticorrelation between f<sub>free</sub> and τ<sub>bound</sub> is not artificially introduced by the fitting process</title>
<p>It has been long known that estimations of parameters of multi-exponential models tend to be correlated, due to the fact that multiple parameters can affect the simulated curve in a similar way (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Grinvald and Steinberg, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Johnson, 2000</xref>). In the case of NAD(P)H FLIM, increasing f<sub>free</sub> or reducing τ<sub>bound</sub> affects the overall fluorescence decay similarly. We hypothesized that this artifact of the fitting process could partially explain why τ<sub>bound</sub> and f<sub>free</sub> values consistently exhibit anticorrelated patterns in multiple previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Bird et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Skala et al., 2007</xref>; Wetzker and Reinhardt, 2019; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">Yang et al., 2021</xref>) and in our data (Sup. Figure 8). To verify this hypothesis, we simulated 5,000 decay curves using our bi-exponential model, with τ<sub>free</sub> set to 0.4 ns. <italic>b</italic> was fixed to 1.5·10<sup>-3</sup> to match the overall average of Dataset 2. τ<sub>bound</sub> was uniformly sampled between 3 and 4.5 ns and f<sub>free</sub> between 0.6 and 0.8, similarly to the ranges of within-subject averages obtained from Dataset 2. All simulations used the same arbitrarily selected IRF from Dataset 2 and <italic>Δt</italic> was set to 0. The decay curves were scaled to simulate a photon count of 6000, matching the overall average of Dataset 2. Finally, Poisson-distributed noise was applied. All simulated decay curves were fitted using the same bi-exponential model as in other analyses, with τ<sub>bound</sub> and f<sub>free</sub> as the only parameters. We observed a very low correlation of 0.06 between the estimated values of τ<sub>bound</sub> and f<sub>free</sub> (Sup. Figure 9a), implying that the anticorrelations observed in our study were unlikely introduced by the fitting process.</p>
<p>As a supplementary verification, we simulated 5,000 decay curves from correlated τ<sub>bound</sub> and f<sub>free</sub> couples. Correlated random variables <italic>C<sub>1</sub></italic> and <italic>C<sub>2</sub></italic> were obtained from independent random uniform variables <italic>X<sub>1</sub></italic> and <italic>X<sub>2</sub></italic>using the Cholesky decomposition:
<disp-formula>
<graphic xlink:href="635185v1_ueqn7.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>

with the Pearson correlation ρ set to -0.86 to match the value obtained from Dataset 2. <italic>C<sub>1</sub></italic>and <italic>C<sub>2</sub></italic> were then scaled and offset to vary in the same ranges as τ<sub>bound</sub> and f<sub>free</sub> in the previous simulation. In this simulation, the estimated parameters showed an important negative correlation of -0.64 (Sup. Figure 9b), confirming the capacity of the fitting process to retrieve dependencies between τ<sub>bound</sub> and f<sub>free</sub>.</p>

<title>Image distance metrics</title>
<p>To compare pairs of f<sub>free</sub> spatial distributions registered in the template space, we used a metric termed the “f<sub>free</sub> map distance”. This metric was defined as the average of absolute voxel-wise differences across all valid voxels in a pair of f<sub>free</sub> maps. For the f<sub>free</sub> maps of images A and B, noted F<sub>A</sub> and F<sub>B</sub>, this distance can be formulated as:
<disp-formula>
<graphic xlink:href="635185v1_ueqn8.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>

where N<sub>mask</sub> is the number of voxels in the mask.</p>
<p>For fluorescence intensity images, we employed a metric termed the “normalized image distance”. The compared images were first normalized so that their voxel intensities summed to one. The normalized distance was then calculated as the sum of absolute voxel-wise differences between the normalized images, divided by 2. It can be understood as the fraction of the image intensity that should be displaced to match one image to the other. For images A and B, noted I<sub>A</sub> and I<sub>B</sub>, and their summed intensity S<sub>A</sub> and S<sub>B</sub>, this distance can be formulated as:

<title>Building a map of subtype proportions</title>
<p>A map, estimating the average proportion of each KC subtype over the MB template was derived from Dataset 3. The images of this set are composed of 2 channels, one labeling all KCs with a cytosolic marker and the other labeling KCs from one KC subtype with a nuclear marker. Right-hemisphere images were mirrored. All images were registered to the template based on the KC-specific marker channel. We applied a previously established mask (Sup. Figure 4) to isolate the signal of the somata region in the subtype-specific channel. The masked images were normalized to make the total intensity of each image equal to the number of neurons of the associated subtypes (1002 α/β, 370 α’/β’ and 671 γ neurons on average according to Aso et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Aso et al., 2009</xref>). The intensity of the normalized images can be seen as an approximation of the neuronal density, expressed in neuron/voxel. The three subtype density maps are then summed to produce a KC density map. Finally each subtype density map is divided voxel-wise by the KC density map to produce a subtype proportion map.</p>

<p>This process was carried out using images of Dataset 3. All images were preprocessed following the same steps as for template building (Sup. Figure 3a). Our testing process involved repeated distance measurements (Sup. Figure 5a). The complete set of preprocessed images was first randomly divided into two non-overlapping subsets, arranged in random order. In the mixed-hemisphere case, the half sets were created from left and right images indiscriminately. In the inter-hemisphere case, the first and second subset exclusively contained left and right MB images, respectively. A template was constructed using the first N images from each subset. The resulting average spatial distributions were compared by computing the total absolute difference between them. This procedure was repeated multiple times, with 5 random splits performed for each case.</p>

Figure 10a). Our testing process involved repeated distance measurements (Sup. Figure 10b). For each measurement, the dataset was split into two non-overlapping subsets of images. Each set was composed of images displaying a unique subtype-specific marker. Intra-type comparisons were computed using two sets of the same subtype while extra-type comparisons used sets of different subtypes. In both cases, the first N images of each set were averaged. Finally, the total absolute difference was computed between the two resulting average spatial distributions. This scheme was repeated multiple times for different random splits and values of N. For each neuronal subtypes, 20 splits were used.</p>

<p><bold>(a)</bold> Schematic illustrating the method used to assess differences between templates generated from single or mixed hemispheres. This process used images preprocessed as for template building (Sup. Figure 3a), downsampled by a factor 2 (using linear interpolation and anti-aliasing filtering) to reduce the computational cost. Step 1: The complete set of preprocessed images is randomly divided into two non-overlapping half sets, arranged in random order. In the mixed hemispheres case, the half sets are created by including both left and right images indiscriminately. In the inter-hemispheres case, the first and second half exclusively contain left and right MB images, respectively. Step 2: A template is constructed using the first N images from each half set, where N represents the subset size.

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors present a novel usage of fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) to measure NAD(P)H autofluorescence in the Drosophila brain, as a proxy for cellular metabolic/redox states. This new method relies on the fact that both NADH and NADPH are autofluorescent, with a different excitation lifetime depending on whether they are free (indicating glycolysis) or protein-bound (indicating oxidative phosphorylation). The authors successfully use this method in Drosophila to measure changes in metabolic activity across different areas of the fly brain, with a particular focus on the main center for associative memory: the mushroom body.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors have made a commendable effort to explain the technical aspects of the method in accessible language. This clarity will benefit both non-experts seeking to understand the methodology and researchers interested in applying FLIM to Drosophila in other contexts.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) Despite being statistically significant, the learning-induced change in f-free in α/β Kenyon cells is minimal (a decrease from 0.76 to 0.73, with a high variability). The authors should provide justification for why they believe this small effect represents a meaningful shift in neuronal metabolic state.</p>
<p>(2) The lack of experiments examining the effects of long-term memory (after spaced or massed conditioning) seems like a missed opportunity. Such experiments could likely reveal more drastic changes in the metabolic profiles of KCs, as a consequence of memory consolidation processes.</p>
<p>(3) The discussion is mostly just a summary of the findings. It would be useful if the authors could discuss potential future applications of their method and new research questions that it could help address.</p>

<p>This manuscript presents a compelling application of NAD(P)H fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM) to study metabolic activity in the Drosophila brain. The authors reveal regional differences in oxidative and glycolytic metabolism, with a particular focus on the mushroom body, a key structure involved in associative learning and memory. In particular, they identify metabolic shifts in α/β Kenyon cells following classical conditioning, consistent with their established role in energy-demanding middle- and long-term memories.</p>
<p>These results highlight the potential of label-free FLIM for in-vivo neural circuit studies, providing a powerful complement to genetically encoded sensors. This study is well-conducted and employs rigorous analysis, including careful curve fitting and well-designed controls, to ensure the robustness of its findings. It should serve as a valuable technical reference for researchers interested in using FLIM to study neural metabolism in vivo. Overall, this work represents an important step in the application of FLIM to study the interactions between metabolic processes, neural activity, and cognitive function.</p>

<p>This study investigates the characteristics of the autofluorescence signal excited by 740 nm 2-photon excitation, in the range of 420-500 nm, across the Drosophila brain. The fluorescence lifetime (FL) appears bi-exponential, with a short 0.4 ns time constant followed by a longer decay. The lifetime decay and the resulting parameter fits vary across the brain. The resulting maps reveal anatomical landmarks, which simultaneous imaging of genetically encoded fluorescent proteins helps to identify. Past work has shown that the autofluorescence decay time course reflects the balance of the redox enzyme NAD(P)H vs. its protein-bound form. The ratio of free-to-bound NADPH is thought to indicate relative glycolysis vs. oxidative phosphorylation, and thus shifts in the free-to-bound ratio may indicate shifts in metabolic pathways. The basics of this measure have been demonstrated in other organisms, and this study is the first to use the FLIM module of the STELLARIS 8 FALCON microscope from Leica to measure autofluorescence lifetime in the brain of the fly. Methods include registering the brains of different flies to a common template and masking out anatomical regions of interest using fluorescence proteins.</p>
<p>The analysis relies on fitting an FL decay model with two free parameters, f_free and t_bound. F_free is the fraction of the normalized curve contributed by a decaying exponential with a time constant of 0.4 ns, thought to represent the FL of free NADPH or NADH, which apparently cannot be distinguished. T_bound is the time constant of the second exponential, with scalar amplitude = (1-f_free). The T_bound fit is thought to represent the decay time constant of protein-bound NADPH but can differ depending on the protein. The study shows that across the brain, T_bound can range from 0 to &gt;5 ns, whereas f_free can range from 0.5 to 0.9 (Figure 1a). These methods appear to be solid, the full range of fits are reported, including maximum likelihood quality parameters, and can be benchmarks for future studies.</p>
<p>The authors measure the properties of NADPH-related autofluorescence of Kenyon Cells (KCs) of the fly mushroom body. The results from the three main figures are:</p>
<p>(1) Somata and calyx of mushroom bodies have a longer average tau_bound than other regions (Figure 1e);</p>
<p>(2) The f_free fit is higher for the calyx (input synapses) region than for KC somata (Figure 2b);</p>
<p>(3) The average across flies of average f_free fits in alpha/beta KC somata decreases from 0.734 to 0.718. Based on the first two findings, an accurate title would be &quot;Autofluorecense lifetime imaging reveals regional differences in NADPH state in Drosophila mushroom bodies.&quot;</p>
<p>The third finding is the basis for the title of the paper and the support for this claim is unconvincing. First, the difference in alpha/beta f_free (p-value of 4.98E-2) is small compared to the measured difference in f_free between somas and calyces. It's smaller even than the difference in average soma f_free across datasets (Figure 2b vs c). The metric is also quite derived; first, the model is fit to each (binned) voxel, then the distribution across voxels is averaged and then averaged across flies. If the voxel distributions of f_free are similar to those shown in Supplementary Figure 2, then the actual f_free fits could range between 0.6-0.8. A more convincing statistical test might be to compare the distributions across voxels between alpha/beta vs alpha'/beta' vs. gamma KCs, perhaps with bootstrapping and including appropriate controls for multiple comparisons.</p>
<p>I recommend the authors address two concerns. First, what degree of fluctuation in autofluorescence decay can we expect over time, e.g. over circadian cycles? That would be helpful in evaluating the magnitude of changes following conditioning. And second, if the authors think that metabolism shifts to OXPHOS over glycolosis, are there further genetic manipulations they could make? They test LDH knockdown in gamma KCs, why not knock it down in alpha/beta neurons? The prediction might be that if it prevents the shift to OXPHOS, the shift in f_free distribution in alpha/beta KCs would be attenuated. The extensive library of genetic reagents is an advantage of working with flies, but it comes with a higher standard for corroborating claims.</p>
<p>FLIM as a method is not yet widely prevalent in fly neuroscience, but recent demonstrations of its potential are likely to increase its use. Future efforts will benefit from the description of the properties of the autofluorescence signal to evaluate how autofluorescence may impact measures of FL of genetically engineered indicators.</p>

<p>Thanks for the positive review of our manuscript and for appreciating our work.</p>
<p>We align in many ways with the reviewers comments.. Our initial finding concerning the slight shift of f_free in a/b neurons after conditioning is interesting but we agree it would certainly deserve a follow-up to substantiate its link with memory formation. We also agree that an analysis in distribution rather than through an averaged signal might be more sensitive.</p>
<p>We however have to cope with the fact that extending our investigation would require manpower resources that are no longer available. Therefore we appreciate the suggestion made by the 3 reviewers to restrain the claim and hence change the title to &quot;In vivo NAD(P)H autofluorescence lifetime imaging reveals metabolic heterogeneity within the Drosophila mushroom body.&quot;. We find it matches better with the scope of this study which is mostly to showcase the potential of NAD(P)H FLIM to quantify variations in metabolism in Drosophila brain rather than firmly testing a specific hypothesis linked to memory formation. In this respect, we do provide quantitative results showing metabolic profile variations between brain tissues such as the somata and calyx regions but also between different Kenyon cells subtypes. We would then present the shifts of f_free induced by conditioning as a curio that might entice future work, as advised by Reviewer #2.</p>
<p>Altogether, in the revised version we will change the title to restrain the claim, move two supplementary figures as main figures to better focus on and describe the registration process. We will also correct the figure panels pointed by the reviewers and add individual samples to our boxplots. We will also slightly compress the introduction and expand the discussion on potential applications. Finally, we will evaluate if statistical tests based on distributions may be more sensitive to observe a significant shift in FLIM signal in the a/b KCs after conditioning, to strengthen our last observation if confirmed.</p>
