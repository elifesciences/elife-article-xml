<title>Abstract</title><p>Genetic mutations are a recurrent cause of male infertility. Multiple morphological abnormalities of the flagellum (MMAF) syndrome is a heterogeneous genetic disease, with which more than 50 genes have been linked. Nevertheless, for 50% of patients with this condition, no genetic cause is identified. From a study of a cohort of 167 MMAF patients, pathogenic bi-allelic mutations were identified in the <italic>CCDC146</italic> gene in two patients. This gene encodes a poorly characterized centrosomal protein which we studied in detail here. First, protein localization was studied in two cell lines. We confirmed the centrosomal localization in somatic cells and showed that the protein also presents multiple microtubule-related localizations during mitotic division, suggesting that it is a microtubule-associated protein (MAP). To better understand the function of the protein at the sperm level, and the molecular pathogenesis of infertility associated with <italic>CCDC146</italic> mutations, two genetically modified mouse models were created: a <italic>Ccdc146</italic> knock-out (KO) and a knock-in (KI) expressing a HA-tagged CCDC146 protein. KO male mice were completely infertile, and sperm exhibited a phenotype identical to our two MMAF patient’s phenotype with <italic>CCDC146</italic> mutations. No other pathology was observed, and the animals were viable. CCDC146 expression starts during late spermiogenesis, at the time of flagellum biogenesis. In the spermatozoon, the protein is conserved but is not localized to centrioles, unlike in somatic cells, rather it is present in the axoneme at the level of microtubule doublets. Expansion microscopy associated with the use of the detergent sarkosyl to solubilize microtubule doublets, provided evidence that the protein could be a microtubule inner protein (MIP). At the subcellular level, the absence of CCDC146 affected the formation, localization and morphology of all microtubule-based organelles such as the manchette, the head–tail coupling apparatus (HTCA), and the axoneme. Through this study, we have characterized a new genetic cause of infertility, identified a new factor in the formation and/or structure of the sperm axoneme, and demonstrated that the CCDC146 protein plays several cellular roles, depending on the cell type and the stages in the cell cycle.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Infertility is a major health concern, affecting approximately 50 million couples worldwide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>], or 12.5% of women and 10% of men. It is defined by the World Health Organization (WHO) as the “failure to achieve a pregnancy after 12 months or more of regular unprotected sexual intercourse”. In almost all countries, infertile couples have access to assisted reproductive technology (ART) to try to conceive a baby, and there are now 5 million people born as a result of ART. Despite this success, almost half of the couples seeking medical support for infertility fails to successfully conceive and bear a child by the end of their medical care. The main reason for these failures is that one member of the couple produces gametes that are unable to support fertilization and/or embryonic development. Indeed, ART does not specifically treat or even try to elucidate the underlying causes of a couple’s infertility, rather it tries to bypass the observed defects. Consequently, when defects in the gametes cannot be circumvented by the techniques currently proposed, ART fails. To really treat infertility, a first step would be to gain a better understanding of the problems with gametogenesis for each patient. This type of approach should increase the likelihood of adopting the best strategy for affected patients, and if necessary, should guide the development of innovative therapies.</p>
<p>Male infertility has several causes, such as infectious diseases, anatomical defects, or a genetic deficiency. Genetic defects play a major role in male infertility, with over 4000 genes thought to be involved in sperm production, of which more than 2000 are testis-enriched and almost exclusively involved in spermatogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>]. Mutations in any of these genes can negatively affect spermatogenesis and produce one of many described sperm disorders. The characterization and identification of the molecular bases of male infertility is thus a real challenge. Nevertheless, thanks to the emergence of massively parallel sequencing technologies, such as whole exome sequencing (WES) and whole genome sequencing (WGS), the identification of genetic defects has been greatly facilitated in recent years. As a consequence, remarkable progress has been made in the characterization of numerous human genetic diseases, including male infertility.</p>
<p>Today, more than 120 genes are associated with all types of male infertility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>], including quantitative and qualitative sperm defects. Qualitative spermatogenesis defects impacting sperm morphology, also known as “teratozoospermia”[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>], are a heterogeneous group of abnormalities covering a wide range of sperm phenotypes. Among these phenotypes, some relate to the morphology of the flagellum. These defects are usually not uniform, and patients’ sperm show a wide range of flagellar morphologies such as short and/or coiled and/or irregularly sized flagella. Due to this heterogeneity, this phenotype is now referred to as multiple morphological abnormalities of the sperm flagellum (MMAF)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>]. Sperm from these patients are generally immotile, and patients are sterile.</p>
<p>Given the number of proteins present in the flagellum and necessary for its formation and functioning, many genes have already been linked to the MMAF phenotype. Study of the MMAF phenotype in humans has allowed the identification of around 50 genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>] coding for proteins involved in axonemal organization, present in the structures surrounding the axoneme – such as the outer dense fibers and the fibrous sheath – and involved in intra-flagellar transport (IFT). Moreover, some genes have been identified from mouse models, and their human orthologs are very good gene candidates for MMAF, even if no patient has yet been identified with mutations in these genes. Finally, based on the remarkable structural similarity of the axonemal structure of motile cilia and flagella, some MMAF genes were initially identified in the context of primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD). However, this structural similarity does not necessarily imply a molecular similarity, and only around half (10 of the 22 PCD-related genes identified so far [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>]) are effectively associated with male infertility. However, in most cases, the number of patients is very low and the details of the sperm tail phenotype are unknown [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>].</p>
<p>We have recruited 167 patients with MMAF. Following whole exome sequencing, biallelic deleterious variants in 22 genes were identified in 83 subjects. The genes identified are <italic>AK7</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>], <italic>ARMC2</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>], <italic>CFAP206</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>], <italic>CCDC34</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>], <italic>CFAP251</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>], <italic>CFAP43</italic> and <italic>CFAP44</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>], <italic>CFAP47</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>], <italic>CFAP61</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>], <italic>CFAP65</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>], <italic>CFAP69</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>], <italic>CFAP70</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>], <italic>CFAP91</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>], <italic>CFAP206</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>], <italic>DNAH1</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>], <italic>DNAH8</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>], <italic>FSIP2</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>], <italic>IFT74</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>], <italic>QRICH2</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>], <italic>SPEF2</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>], <italic>TTC21A</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>] and <italic>TTC29</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>]. Despite this success, a molecular diagnosis is obtained in half of the patients (49.7%) with this sperm phenotype, suggesting that novel candidate genes remain to be identified. We have pursued our effort with this cohort to identify further mutations that could explain the patient MMAF phenotype. As such, we have identified bi- allelic truncating mutations in <italic>CCDC146</italic> in two unrelated infertile patients displaying MMAF. <italic>CCDC146 is</italic> known to code for a centrosomal protein when heterologously expressed in HeLa cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>], but minimal information is available on its distribution within the cell, or its function when naturally present. Moreover, this gene has never been associated with any human disease.</p>
<p>The centrosome, located adjacent to the nucleus, is a microtubule-based structure composed of a pair of orthogonally-oriented centrioles surrounded by the pericentriolar material (PCM). The centrosome is the major microtubule-organizing center (MTOC) in animal cells, and as such regulates the microtubule organization within the cell. Therefore, it controls intracellular organization and intracellular transport, and consequently regulates cell shape, cell polarity, and cell migration. The centrosome is also crucial for cell division as it controls the assembly of the mitotic/meiotic spindle, ensuring correct segregation of sister chromatids in each of the daughter cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>]. The importance of this organelle is highlighted by the fact that 3% (579 proteins) of all known human proteins have been experimentally detected in the centrosome (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.proteinatlas.org/humanproteome/subcellular/centrosome">https://www.proteinatlas.org/humanproteome/subcellular/centrosome</ext-link>). Centrioles also play essential roles in spermatogenesis and particularly during spermiogenesis. In round spermatids, the centriole pair docks to the cell membrane, whereas the distal centriole serves as the basal body initiating assembly of the axoneme. The proximal centriole then tightly attaches to the sperm nucleus and gradually develops the head-to-tail coupling apparatus (HTCA), linking the sperm head to the flagellum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>]. In human and bovine sperm, the proximal centriole is retained and the distal centriole is remodeled to produce an ‘atypical’ centriole [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>]; in contrast, in rodents, both centrioles are degenerated during epididymal maturation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>]. Despite the number of proteins making up the centrosome, and its importance in sperm differentiation and flagellum formation, very few centrosomal proteins have been linked to MMAF in humans – so far only CEP135 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>], CEP148 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>] or DZIP1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>]. Moreover, some major axonemal proteins with an accessory location in the centrosome, such as CFAP58 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>] and ODF2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>], have also been reported to be involved in MMAF syndrome. Other centrosomal proteins lead to MMAF in mice, these include CEP131 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>] and CCDC42 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>]. The discovery that MMAF in humans is linked to CCDC146, known so far as a centrosomal protein, adds to our knowledge of proteins important for axoneme biogenesis.</p>
<p>In this manuscript, we first evaluated the localization of endogenous CCDC146 during the cell cycle in two types of cell cultures, immortalized cells and primary human foreskin fibroblasts. To validate the gene candidate and improve our knowledge of the corresponding protein, we also generated two mouse models. The first one was a <italic>Ccdc146</italic> KO model, with which to study the impact of lack of the protein on the general phenotype, and in particular on male reproductive function using several optical and electronic microscopy techniques. The second model was a HA-tagged CCDC146 model, with which we studied the localization of the protein in different cell types. Data from these genetically modified mouse models were confirmed in human sperm cells.</p>

<title>WES identifies <italic>CCDC146</italic> as a gene involved in MMAF</title>
<p>We performed whole exome sequencing (WES) to investigate a highly-selected cohort of 167 MMAF patients previously described in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>]. The WES data was analyzed using an open-source bioinformatics pipeline developed in-house, as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>]. From these data, we identified two patients with homozygous truncating variants in the <italic>CCDC146</italic> (coiled-coil domain containing 146) gene, NM_020879.3 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). No other candidate variants reported to be associated with male infertility was detected in these patients. This gene is highly transcribed in both human and mouse testes (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supp Figure 1</xref>). The first identified mutation is located in exon 9/19 and corresponds to c.1084C&gt;T, the second is located in exon 15/19 and corresponds to c.2112Del (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). The c.1084C&gt;T variant is a nonsense mutation, whereas the single-nucleotide deletion c.2112Del is predicted to induce a translational frameshift. Both mutations were predicted to produce premature stop codons: p.(Arg362Ter) and p.(Arg704serfsTer7), respectively, leading either to the complete absence of the protein, or to the production of a truncated and non-functional protein. The two mutations are therefore most-likely deleterious (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). Both variants were absent in our control cohort and their minor allele frequencies (MAF), according to the gnomAD v3 database, were 6.984x10<sup>-5</sup> and 0 respectively. The presence of these variants and their homozygous state were verified by Sanger sequencing, as illustrated in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>. Taken together, these elements strongly suggest that mutations in the <italic>CCDC146</italic> gene could be responsible for the infertility of these two patients and the MMAF phenotype.</p>

<title><italic>Ccdc146</italic> knock-out mouse model confirms that lack of CCDC146 is associated with MMAF</title>
<p>To validate the hypothesis that CCDC146 deficiency leads to MMAF and male infertility, we produced by CRISPR/Cas9 two mouse lines carrying each a frameshift mutation in <italic>Ccdc146</italic> (ENSMUST00000115245). (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Supp Figure 2</xref>). We analyzed the reproductive phenotype of the edited animals form the F2 generation and found that homozygous males were infertile and reproduced the MMAF phenotype like the two patients carrying the homozygous variants in the orthologous gene. Based on these findings, we restricted our study to a strain with a 4-bp deletion in exon 2 (c.164_167delTTCG).</p>
<p>The KO mice were viable without apparent defects. The reproductive phenotypes of male and female mice were explored. WT or heterozygous animals and KO females were fertile, whereas KO males were completely infertile (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). This infertility is associated with a 90% decrease in epididymal sperm concentration (from ∼30- to ∼3-million) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>) and an almost complete absence of motility (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>). Closer examination revealed sperm morphology to be strongly altered, with a typical MMAF phenotype and marked defects in head morphology (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>) indicative of significantly impaired spermiogenesis. In addition, testicle weight relative to whole body weight was significantly lower (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>), suggesting a germ cell rarefaction in the seminiferous epithelia due to high apoptosis level. A study of spermatogenic cell viability by TUNEL assay confirmed this hypothesis, with a significant increase in the number of positive cells in <italic>Ccdc146</italic> KO animals (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Supp Figure 3</xref>). Comparative histological studies (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>) showed that on sections of spermatogenic tubules, structural and shape defects were present from the elongating spermatid stage in KO mice, with almost complete disappearance of the flagella in the lumen. At the epididymal level, transverse sections of the epididymal tubules from KO males contained almost no spermatozoa, and the tubules were filled with an acellular substance.</p>

<title>CCDC146 codes for a centriolar protein</title>
<p>CCDC146 has been described as a centriolar protein in immortalized HeLa cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>]. To confirm this localization, we performed immunofluorescence experiments (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>). First, we focused on the centrosome. In HEK-293T cells, using an antibody recognizing centrin (anti-centrin Ab) as a centriole marker and an anti-CCDC146 Ab, CCDC146 was shown to colocalize with centrioles. However, the signal was not strictly localized to centrioles, as peri-centriolar labeling was clearly visible. As this labeling pattern suggests the presence of centriolar satellite proteins, we next performed co-labeling with an antibody recognizing PCM1, a canonical centriolar satellite marker [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>]. Once again, the colocalization was only partial (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Supp Figure 4</xref>). Based on these observations, CCDC146 has a unique localization profile that may indicate specific functions.</p>

<title>CCDC146 co-localizes with multiple tubulin-based organelles</title>
<p>Interestingly, our immunofluorescence experiments revealed that CCDC146 labeling was not strictly limited to centrosomes – other tubulin-containing cellular substructures were also labeled, particularly structures emerging during cell division (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>). Thus, the mitotic spindle was labeled at its base and at its ends. The co-labeling intensified in the midzone during chromatid separation. Finally, the separation structure between the two cells, the midbody, was also strongly stained. As HEK-293T cells are an immortalized cell line, we therefore verified that this labeling pattern was not due to an aberrant expression profile and that it also reflected the situation in primary cell lines. Identical labeling profiles were observed in freshly-prepared Human foreskin fibroblasts (HFF cells) (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Supp Figure 5</xref>).</p>

<title>Expression profile of CCDC146 during the first wave of spermatogenesis in mouse</title>
<p>From our immunofluorescence analysis of somatic cell lines, it was clear that CCDC146 expression is associated with the cell cycle. In the testis, a wide variety of cell types co-exist, including both somatic and germline cells. The germline cells can be further subcategorized into a wide variety of cells, some engaged in proliferation (spermatogonia), others in meiosis (spermatocytes), or in differentiation (spermatids). To better understand the role of CCDC146 in spermatogenesis, and thus how its absence leads to sperm death and malformation, we initially studied its expression during the first wave of spermatogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>] and sought to detect the protein in testis extracts at several postnatal timepoints and in the mature epididymal spermatozoon. Results from this study should shed light on when CCDC146 is required for sperm formation. Surprisingly, RT-PCR failed to detect <italic>Ccdc146</italic> transcripts in proliferating spermatogonia on day 9 after birth (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>). Transcription of <italic>Ccdc146</italic> started on day 18, concomitantly with the initiation of meiosis 2. Expression peaked on day 26, during the differentiation of spermatids. We also wished to explore the expression of the protein. To overcome a lack of specific antibodies recognizing mouse CCDC146, a transgenic mouse was created: (hemagglutinin) sequence was inserted by the CRISPR/Cas9 system into the coding sequence of the <italic>Ccdc146</italic> gene between the two first codons to produce a tagged protein at the N-terminus domain (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Supp Figure 6</xref>). This insertion induced no phenotypic changes, and both female and male mice were viable with normal fertility. Tag insertion was validated by Western blotting (WB) (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>). The theoretical MW of the tagged protein is around 116.2 kDa (115.1 + 1.1); the observed MW was slightly higher, suggesting some post-translational modifications. Using these mice, testicular extracts from several postnatal timepoints and from epididymal spermatozoa were analyzed (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>). In accordance with RT-PCR experiments, bands corresponding to HA-tagged CCDC146 were detectable at D26 and 35, and in epididymal sperm (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>). The protein is therefore present during spermatid differentiation and conserved in mature sperm. The absence of the protein during spermatogonia proliferation suggests a new function for CCDC146 in sperm cells.</p>

<title>In sperm, CCDC146 is present in the flagellum, not in the centriole</title>
<p>To attempt to elucidate the function of CCDC146 in sperm cells, we next studied its localization by IF in human and murine spermatozoa. We focused successively on the anterior segment (head, neck and beginning of the intermediate piece) of the sperm and then on the flagellum. In humans, the spermatozoon retains its two centrioles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>], and they are observable in the neck, as shown by anti-centrin and anti-tubulin labeling (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A</xref>1-3). No colocalization of the CCDC146 label with centrin was observed on human sperm centrioles, suggesting that the protein is not present in or around this structure. However, two unexpected labeling events were observed: sub-acrosomal labeling and labeling of the midpiece. At the flagellum level, faint staining was observed along the whole length (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A</xref>4).</p>

The CCDC146 staining observed probably corresponds to non-specific labeling of mitochondria.</p></caption>
<graphic xlink:href="530236v1_fig7.tif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/>
</fig>
<p>To enhance resolution, ultrastructure expansion microscopy (U-ExM), an efficient method to study in detail the ultrastructure of organelles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>], was used (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7B</xref>). The localization of the two centrioles was perfectly visible following anti-tubulin labeling, and was confirmed by co-labeling with an anti- POC5 Ab (<xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Supp Figure 7</xref>). Once again, no CCDC146 labeling was observed on sperm centrioles (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7B</xref>3), confirming the conventional IF results. Moreover, U-ExM unveiled that the observed CCDC146 midpiece staining (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A</xref>) seems in fact associated with isolated structures, which we hypothesize could be mitochondria, now visible by expansion (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7B</xref>1). This suggests that the labeling on the midpiece observed in IF corresponds to non-specific mitochondrial labeling. This conclusion is supported by the fact that the same isolated structures were also labeled with anti-POC5 Ab (<xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Supp Figure 7</xref>). In contrast, at the flagellum level, clear punctiform labeling was observed along the whole length of the main piece (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7B</xref>1-B3), confirming that the protein is present in the sperm flagellum.</p>
<p>The same experiments were performed on murine epididymal spermatozoa. For this study, we used the mouse model expressing HA-tagged CCDC146 protein. It should be noted that unlike in humans, in mice, centrioles are no longer present in epididymal spermatozoa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>]. In conventional IF, using an anti-HA Ab, labeling was observed along the whole flagellum (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8A</xref>). The strong HA-labeling in the midpiece was clearly non-specific, as the signal was still present when secondary antibodies were used alone (<xref rid="figs8" ref-type="fig">Supp Figure 8</xref>). In expansion microscopy, unexpectedly, the mouse flagellum presented breaks that most likely resulted from the expansion procedure (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8B</xref>). Interestingly, strong HA-labeling was observed at the level of these breaks suggesting that CCDC146 epitopes are buried inside the axonemal structure and become accessible mostly on blunt or broken microtubule doublets. The same pattern was observed with three different anti-HA antibodies (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8A-C</xref>). To confirm the presence of CCDC146 in the flagellum, sperm flagella were purified after mild sonication, and protein extracts were analyzed by WB (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8D</xref>). In the flagella fraction, the HA Ab revealed a single band at around 120 kDa, thus confirming the flagellar localization of CCDC146 in both human and mouse sperm.</p>

<title>CCDC146 labeling associates with microtubule doublets</title>
<p>We next wanted to determine whether CCDC146 staining was associated with the axoneme or accessory structures of the flagellum (outer dense fibers or fibrous sheath), and if yes, whether it was associated with microtubule doublets or the central pair. To do so, we used U-ExM on human sperm and quantified the relative position of each CCDC146 dot observed (outside the axoneme, outer left and right; microtubule doublets left and right and central pair – <xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9A-C</xref>). The distribution of localizations was summarized in two bar graphs, generated for two distinct sperm cells. Labeling was preferentially located on the right and left doublets (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9D</xref> and <xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">9F</xref>), indicating that CCDC146 associates more with microtubule doublets. Analysis of protein distribution in mice was not easy, because signal tended to concentrate at breaks. Nevertheless, on some spermatozoa with frayed microtubule doublets., i.e. with the flagellum taking on the shape of a hair, we could find that isolated doublets carried the punctiform labeling confirming the results of analyses on human spermatozoa (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9G</xref>). Taken together, these results from mouse and human sperm demonstrate that CCDC146 is an axonemal protein, probably associated with microtubule doublets.</p>

<title>CCDC146 could be a Microtubule Inner Protein (MIP)</title>
<p>The presence of extensive labeling at axoneme breaks suggests that the antigenic site is difficult to access in an intact flagellum. We therefore hypothesized that CCDC146 could be a MIP. MIPs are generally resistant to solubilization by detergents. However, N-lauroylsarcosine (sarkosyl) can solubilize microtubule doublets, with increasing concentrations destabilizing first the A-tubule, then the B-tubule [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>]. Microtubule solubilization allows release of the MIPs contained within the tubules, and the method is recognized [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>]. To test whether our hypothesis that CCDC146 is a MIP, we treated spermatozoa from HA-tagged CCDC146 mice with sarkosyl and performed a WB on the supernatant (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Figure 10A</xref>). The protein was effectively solubilized, leading to the appearance of bands at around 120 kDa on an SDS-PAGE gel following migration of extracts from sperm treated with 0.2 and 0.4% sarkosyl concentrations. Interestingly, a second band around 90 kDa was also immunodecorated by anti-HA antibody in the sarkosyl treated sample, a band not present in the protein extracts from WT males. The other detergents and buffers tested – RIPA, CHAPS or Tris-HCl – barely solubilized CCDC146 or led to no solubilization (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Figure 10B</xref>). This result confirms the unique action of sarkosyl on CCDC146 and strengthens the hypothesis that the protein is localized in the lumen of tubules. To confirm the action of sarkosyl on the accessibility of the antigenic site, murine spermatozoa were labeled with an anti-HA antibody after treatment with sarkosyl or no treatment. CCDC146 labeling was significantly increased in the presence of sarkosyl (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Figure 10C</xref>).

<title>KO models show defects in tubulin-made organelles</title>
<p>To better characterize the function of CCDC146 in mouse sperm, we went on to perform a detailed morphological analysis of tubulin-made organelles by IF, and examined the morphological defects induced by the absence of CCDC146 at the subcellular level by scanning and/or transmission electron microscopy. This work was performed on immature testicular sperm and on seminiferous tubule sections from adult WT and KO males. Mouse testicular sperm were used because they still contain centrioles that become disassembled as sperm transit through the epididymis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>]. We mainly focused our analyses on the centrioles, the manchette, and the axoneme.</p>
<p>The connecting piece between the head and the flagellum, known as the sperm head-tail coupling apparatus (HTCA), is a complex structure containing several substructures including both centrioles, the capitulum and the segmented columns. The distal centriole is embedded in the segmented column and the axoneme emerges from the distal centriole. This structure has a specific shape when observed by scanning electron microscopy (<xref rid="fig11" ref-type="fig">Figure 11A</xref>). In <italic>Ccdc146</italic> KO sperm, the connecting piece was severely damaged (<xref rid="fig11" ref-type="fig">Figure 11A</xref>). In WT testicular sperm, IF experiments show that the centrioles, identified by anti-tubulin Ab, are very close to each other and adjacent to the capitulum (<xref rid="fig11" ref-type="fig">Figure 11B</xref>). In <italic>Ccdc146</italic> KO males, centriole separation was visible in numerous spermatozoa (<xref rid="fig11" ref-type="fig">Figure 11B</xref>3, B4), with the structures located far away from the connecting piece (<xref rid="fig11" ref-type="fig">Figure 11B</xref>5) or duplicated (<xref rid="fig11" ref-type="fig">Figure 11B6</xref>). Interestingly, the overall structure of the HTCA under construction in spermatids, observed by TEM, was conserved in <italic>Ccdc146</italic> KO spermatids, with the presence of both centrioles, containing nine triplets of microtubules, the proximal centriole and its adjunct, as well as accessory cytoskeletal structures, including the capitulum and the segmented columns (<xref rid="fig12" ref-type="fig">Figure 12AB</xref>). Remarkably, in a very large proportion of sections, no singlet or doublet of microtubules emerged from the distal KO centriole, suggesting that the process of tubulin polymerization is somehow hampered in these cells (<xref rid="fig12" ref-type="fig">Figure 12A</xref>). The absence of microtubules at the end of the distal centriole was confirmed by analysis of serial sections of the sperm centrioles (<xref rid="fig12" ref-type="fig">Figure 12C</xref>). Moreover, the defects observed in IF experiments, such as duplication, or defective attachment to the nuclear membrane, were frequently confirmed in TEM images (<xref rid="figs10" ref-type="fig">Supp Figure 10</xref>). Such defects were not observed in WT spermatids.</p>

<p>Manchette formation – which occurs from the round spermatid to fully-elongated spermatid stages – was next studied by IF using β-tubulin Ab. Simultaneously, we monitored formation of the acrosome using an antibody binding to DPY19L2 (<xref rid="fig13" ref-type="fig">Figure 13</xref>). Initial acrosome binding at step III was not disrupted, and we observed no differences in the caudal descent of the acrosome during subsequent steps (III- VIII). The development of the manchette in between stages IX-XII was not hampered, but noticeable defects appeared indicating defective manchette organization– such as a random orientation of the spermatids and abnormal acrosome shapes. Finally, at step I, the manchette was clearly longer and wider than in WT cells, suggesting that the control of the manchette biogenesis is defective. In TEM, microtubules in the manchette were clearly visible surrounding the compacting nucleus of elongating spermatids. However, many defects such as marked asymmetry and enlargement were visible (<xref rid="fig14" ref-type="fig">Figure 14</xref>). The manchette normally anchors on the perinuclear ring, which is itself localized just below the marginal edge of the acrosome and separated by the groove belt [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>]. In KO spermatids, the perinuclear ring was no longer localized in the vicinity of the acrosome and was often spread into the cytoplasm, providing a large nucleation structure for the manchette (<xref rid="fig14" ref-type="fig">Figure 14</xref> D-F, red arrows), which explains its width and irregularity.</p>

<p>Numerous defects were also observed in the axoneme.

<p>Finally, the shape of the nucleus presented numerous abnormalities (<xref rid="figs11" ref-type="fig">Supp Figure 11</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study allowed us to identify and validate the involvement of a new candidate gene in male infertility, <italic>CCDC146</italic>. This gene was first described in mice by our team earlier this year, in the context of a research project on the different types of genetic causes of sperm abnormalities in mouse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>]. However, no data other than the sperm phenotype (MMAF) was presented in this initial report. In this paper, we present for the first time, the evidence of the presence of mutations in humans and a description of the localization of the protein in somatic and germ cells. We also examined the lesion spectrum at the subcellular level, to obtain a detailed view of the molecular pathogenesis associated with defects in this gene.</p>
<sec id="s3a">

<title>Genetic complexity of MMAF</title>
<p>It is essential to characterize all genes involved in male infertility. Therefore, the characterization of a new gene involved in MMAF syndrome is not just &quot;one more gene&quot;. First, it further confirms that MMAF syndrome is a heterogeneous recessive genetic disease, currently associated with defects in more than 50 genes. Second, it helps direct the diagnostic strategy to be directed during genome-wide searches. The type of profiling required for MMAF is very different from that performed for instance for cystic fibrosis, where one mutation is responsible for more than 50% of cases. Third, the discovery of all genes involved in MMAF is important in the context of oligogenic heterozygous inheritance of sperm abnormalities in human [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>]. Indeed, a homozygous deleterious mutation is found in only half of all MMAF patients, suggesting that other modes of inheritance must be involved. Only by establishing an extended list of genes linked to MMAF will it be possible to determine whether oligogenic heterozygous inheritance is a relevant cause of this syndrome in humans. Finally, some of the genes involved in MMAF syndrome are also involved in ciliary diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>]. By further exploring MMAF-type infertility, we can hope to enhance our understanding of another underlying pathology. Although the vast majority of patients with PCD are diagnosed before 5 years of age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>], one study showed that in a in a cohort of 240 adults with a mean age of 36 years (36 ± 13) presenting with chronic productive cough and recurrent chest infections, PCD was identified for the first time in 10% of patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>]. This result suggests that infertility diagnosis can occur before PCD diagnosis, and consequently that infertility management might improve PCD diagnosis and care.</p>

<title>Functional complexity of CCDC146</title>
<p>The results presented in this report show striking differences in localization of CCDC146 between somatic and germ cells. Our results show that the protein displays several subcellular localizations, which vary according to the cell cycle, and the cell nature. In somatic cells, the protein is mostly associated with the centrosome and other microtubular structures – in particular the mitotic spindle – at the end of microtubules and at the level of the kinetochore and the midbody. These observations identify CCDC146 as a microtubule-associated protein (MAP). In contrast, in spermatozoa, IF images indicate that CCDC146 is an axonemal protein that could be localized in the microtubule doublets. Moreover, the CCDC146 signal was enhanced when sperm were treated with the sarkosyl detergent, used to identify microtubule inner proteins (MIP). Finally, expansion microscopy revealed a strong signal in mouse sperm at the point of axoneme rupture. Taken together, these elements suggest that CCDC146 may be a MIP. Despite its broad cellular distribution, the association of CCDC146 with tubulin-dependent structures is remarkable. However, centrosomal and axonemal localizations in somatic and germ cells, respectively, have also been reported for CFAP58 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>], thus the re-use of centrosomal proteins in the sperm flagellar axoneme is not unheard of. In addition, 80% of all proteins identified as centrosomal are found in multiple localizations (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.proteinatlas.org/humanproteome/subcellular/centrosome">https://www.proteinatlas.org/humanproteome/subcellular/centrosome</ext-link>). The ability of a protein to home to several locations depending on its cellular environment has been widely described, in particular for MAP. The different localizations are linked to the presence of distinct binding sites on the protein. For example, MAP6 binds and stabilizes microtubules, through Mc modules, and associates with membranes and neuroreceptors through palmitoylated cysteines. MAP6 can also localize in the microtubule lumen, in its role as MIP, thanks to its Mn modules. Finally, in addition to its associations with subcellular compartments and receptors, the presence of proline-rich domains (PRD) in the MAP6 sequence, allows it to bind to SH3-domain-containing proteins, and thus triggering activation of signaling pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>]. Another example of a protein with multiple localizations is CFAP21, which is a MIP but also a cytosolic calcium sensor. In the latter capacity, CFAP21 modulates the interaction of STIM1 and ORAI1 upon depletion of calcium stores [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>]. These examples illustrate the complexity of function of some multiple-domain proteins.</p>
<p>The fact that CCDC146 can localize to multiple subcellular compartments suggests that it also contains several domains. Interestingly, a PF05557 motif (Pfam mitotic checkpoint protein, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/protein/UniProt/E9Q9F7/">https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/protein/UniProt/E9Q9F7/</ext-link>) has been identified in the mouse CCDC146 sequence between amino acids 130 and 162. Proteins belonging to the “mitotic spindle checkpoint” monitor correct attachment of the bipolar spindle to the kinetochores. The presence of this motif likely explains the ability of CCDC146 to localize to cell cycle-dependent subcellular compartments containing tubulin. However, the most important structural motifs identified in CCDC146 are the coiled-coil domains. Although coiled-coils play a structural role in a variety of protein interactions, their presence in CCDC146 remains mysterious, and how they contribute to its function remains to be elucidated. Nevertheless, this motif is compatible with a MIP function for this protein, since several MIP proteins including CCDC11 (FAP53), CCDC19 (FAP45), and CCDC173 (FAP210) are coiled-coil proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>]. It is worth noting that the ortholog of <italic>CCDC146</italic> in <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic>, <italic>MBO2</italic>, codes for a protein required for the beak-like projections of doublets 5 and 6, located inside the lumen of the tubule B [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>], in the proximal part of the <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> flagellum. Although no beak-like projections are present in the mammalian axoneme, the location inside the tubule seems to be evolutionarily conserved. A more recent study of MBO2 showed that the protein is also present all along the flagellum of <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> and is tightly associated with microtubule doublets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>]. These observations support our results showing association of CCDC146 with this axonemal structure.</p>
<p>The results presented here also show a striking difference in the phenotype induced by the lack of the protein in somatic and male germ cells. This protein is essential for spermatogenesis, and its absence leads to immotile non-functional sperm and to complete infertility in both humans and mice. Conversely, both patients and <italic>Ccdc146</italic> KO mice seem to be healthy and present no other conditions such as primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD). CCDC146, despite its wide expression profile in many tissues therefore seems to be dispensable except during spermatogenesis. Nevertheless, because this protein is localized on the tips of the spindle and may be involved in mitotic checkpoints, its absence may lead to late proliferative disorders. This hypothesis is supported by the fact that <italic>CCDC146</italic> is reported to be down-regulated in thyroid cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>]. The link between infertility and risk of cancer was recently underlined, with mutations found in genes like <italic>FANCM</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref>]. Therefore, it would be interesting to monitor aging in <italic>Ccdc146</italic> KO mice and to study their life expectancy and cancer rates compared to WT mice.</p>

<title>Absence of CCDC146 in sperm centriole</title>
<p>Several proteomics studies of the sperm centriole identified CCDC146 as a centrosome-associated protein in bovine sperm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref>], a species where centrioles are present in ejaculated sperm. Using a different methodological approach, based on IF with conventional and expansion microscopy, we observed no CCDC146 signal in centrioles from testicular mouse and ejaculated human sperm. The same result was obtained with two different types of antibodies: with human sperm, we used a commercial anti-CCDC146 Ab, whereas with mouse sperm we used several anti-HA antibodies. The same IF approach allowed us to clearly identify the sperm centrosome using a number of antibodies such as anti-POC5 and anti-beta tubulin, ruling out a possible failure of our IF protocol. It is worth noting that centrosomal proteins were isolated from whole flagella using several strategies including sequential use of multiple detergents, and that the centrosomal proteins were purified in the last fractions. These results indicate that CCDC146 is in fact barely soluble in conventional buffers, which could explain why it is co-purified with the centrosomal fraction in proteomics studies.</p>

<title>TEM reveals that lack of CCDC146 severely impacts microtubule-based organelles</title>
<p>No morphological defects were observed before the elongating spermatid stage, and in round spermatids, the acrosome started to spread on the nucleus in a normal way (<xref rid="fig13" ref-type="fig">Figure 13</xref>). Morphological defects appeared clearly from the onset of spermatid elongation. This result indicates that the protein is only necessary for late spermiogenesis, from the phase corresponding to flagellum biogenesis. All the organelles composed mainly of tubulin were strongly affected by the absence of the protein.</p>
<p>The manchette structure in elongating <italic>Ccdc146</italic> KO spermatids was asymmetric, abnormally broad, and ectopic, leading to the formation of aberrantly-shaped sperm heads. So far, manchette defects have been associated with defects in intra-flagellar transport (IFT), and intra-manchette transport (IMT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref>]. CCDC146 was only localized to the sperm axoneme by IF, and no signal was observed in the manchette, suggesting that CCDC146 is probably not involved in the transport machinery. Moreover, our results indicated that the manchette was remarkably long in elongated spermatids. A similar phenotype was observed in Katanin80-deficient animals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref>]. Katanin80 is a microtubule-severing enzyme that is important for manchette reduction. Interestingly, the absence of WDR62, a scaffold protein involved in centriole duplication, leads to defective katanin80 expression, and the presence of elongated manchettes in mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref>]. In combination with our results, this detail suggests that the manchette’s structure and its reduction are influenced by centrosomal proteins, possibly through katanin defects. The precise molecular link between CCDC146 and manchette assembly and reduction remains to be identified.</p>
<p>The HTCA was also aberrant in <italic>Ccdc146</italic> KO spermatids. Centrioles in elongating spermatids were frequently displaced from their implantation fossa at the nuclear envelope. We observed some correctly lodged centrioles in round spermatids; however, we are unable to determine with certainty whether the majority of centrioles failed to correctly attach or whether they detached from the nuclear envelope during spermatid elongation. Defects in cohesion of the HTCA have been associated with the acephalic spermatozoa syndrome, and were shown to involve a number of proteins such as SUN5, SPATA6 and ODF1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref>]. Here, we did not observe any sperm decapitation, suggesting that CCDC146 is involved in a different pathway controlling the HTCA. Moreover, elongating <italic>Ccdc146</italic> KO spermatids displayed supernumerary centrioles. Abnormal centriole numbers have also been reported in the absence of a few other centrosome-associated proteins including DZIP1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>] and CCDC42 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>], and of microtubule-regulating proteins such as katanin like-2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref>] and tubulin deglutamylase CCP5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref>].</p>
<p>Studies of the spermiogenesis defects observed in different models deficient for centrosomal proteins show some common features such as abnormal manchette and duplicated centrosomes. The absence of these proteins does not appear to be directly responsible for these defects, rather it seems to modify the expression of microtubule regulatory proteins such as katanins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref>]. These modifications could explain the pleiotropic effect of the absence of CCDC146 on microtubule-based organelles.</p>
<p>In conclusion, by characterizing the genetic causes of human infertility, we not only improve the diagnosis and prognosis of these pathologies but also pave the way for the discovery of new players in spermatogenesis. We are constantly adding to the number of proteins present in the flagella of the mammalian spermatozoa that are necessary for its construction and functioning. This study showed that CCDC146, a protein previously described as a centrosomal protein in somatic and germ cells, localizes in spermatozoa’s axonemal microtubule doublets. The presence of CCDC146 in somatic cells’ centrosomes gives weight to the idea of a centrosome with a dynamic composition, allowing it to fulfill its multitude of functions throughout all the phases of cellular life.</p>

<title>Generation of Ccdc146 KO and HA-tagged CCDC146 mice</title>
<p><italic>Ccdc146</italic> KO mice were generated using the CRISPR/Cas9 technology as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>]. Briefly, to maximize the chances of generating deleterious mutations, two gRNAs located in two distinct coding exons located at the beginning of the targeted gene were used. For each gene, the two gRNAs (5’-CCT ACA GTT AAC ATT CGG G-3’ and 5’-GGG AGT ACA ATA TTC AGT AC-3’), respectively targeting exons 2 and 4, were inserted into two distinct plasmids, each plasmid also contained the Cas9 sequence (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Supp Figure 2</xref>). The Cas9 gene was controlled by a CMV promoter and the gRNA and its RNA scaffold by a U6 promoter. Full plasmids (pSpCas9 BB-2A-GFP (PX458)) containing the specific sgRNA were ordered from Genescript (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.genscript.com/crispr-synthetic-sgrna.html">https://www.genscript.com/crispr-synthetic-sgrna.html</ext-link>). Both plasmids were co-injected into the zygotes’ pronuclei at a concentration of 2.5 ng/mL. Plasmids were directly injected as delivered by the supplier, without in vitro production and purification of Cas9 proteins and sgRNA.</p>
<p>Ccdc146-HA knock-in mice were also generated by CRISPR/Cas9. Twenty-seven nucleotides encoding the HA (hemagglutinin) tag (5’-TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCT TAG-3’) were inserted immediately after the start codon of Ccdc146. One plasmid containing one sgRNA (5’-TAC TTT AGA ACT GTG AAA AA-3’) and Cas9 was injected (5 ng/μL) with a single-stranded DNA (150 nucleotides, 50 ng/μl) as a template for the homology directed repair (HDR) <xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Appendix figure 6</xref>. PCR primers used for genotyping are listed in Table supplementary 1. Transgenic CCDC146 strains were bred in the Grenoble university animal platform (HTAG) and housed under specific-pathogen-free conditions. Animals were euthanized by cervical dislocation at the indicated ages.</p>

<title>Expansion microscopy (U-ExM)</title>
<p>Coverslips used for either sample loading (12 mm) or image acquisition (24 mm) were first washed with absolute ethanol and dried. They were then coated with poly-D-lysine (0.1 mg/mL) for 1 h at 37 °C and washed three times with ddH2O before use. Sperm from cauda epididymides or human sperm from straws were washed twice in PBS. 1x10<sup>6</sup> sperm cells were spun onto 12-mm coverslips for 3 min at 300 g. Crosslinking was performed in 1 mL of PBS/1.4% formaldehyde/2% acrylamide (ThermoFisher) for 5 h at 37 °C in a wet incubator. Cells were embedded in a gel by placing a 35-μL drop of a monomer solution consisting of PBS/19% sodium acrylate/10% acrylamide/0.1% N,N’- methylenbisacrylamide/0.2% TEMED/0.2% APS (ThermoFisher) on parafilm and carefully placing coverslips on the drop, with sperm facing the gelling solution. Gelation proceeded in two steps: 5 min on ice followed by 1 h at 37 °C. Coverslips with attached gels were transferred into a 6-well plate for incubation in 5 mL of denaturation buffer (200 mM SDS, 200 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris in ddH2O, pH 9) for 20 min at RT until gels detached. Then, gels were transferred to a 1.5-mL microtube filled with fresh denaturation buffer and incubated for 90 min at 95 °C. Gels were carefully removed with tweezers and placed in beakers filled with 10 mL ddH2O to cause expansion. The water was exchanged at least twice every 30 min. Finally, gels were incubated in 10 mL of ddH2O overnight at RT. The following day, a 5- mm piece of gel was cut out with a punch. To remove excess water, gels were placed in 10 mL PBS for 15 min, the buffer was changed, and incubation repeated once. Subsequently, gels were transferred to a 24-well plate and incubated with 300 µL of primary antibody diluted in PBS/2% BSA at 37 °C for 3 h with vigorous shaking. After three washes for 10 min in PBS/0.1% Tween 20 (PBS-T) under agitation, gels were incubated with 300 µL of secondary antibody in PBS/2% BSA at 37 °C for 3 h with vigorous shaking. Finally, gels were washed three times in PBS-T for 10 min with agitation. Hoechst 33342 (2 µg/mL) was added during the last wash. The expansion resolution was between 4X and 4.2X depending on sodium acrylate purity. For image acquisition, gels were placed in beakers filled with 10 mL ddH2O. Water was exchanged at least twice every 30 min, and then expanded gels were mounted on 24-mm round poly-D-lysine-coated coverslips, placed in a 36-mm metallic chamber for imaging. Confocal microscopy was performed using either a Zeiss LSM 710 using a 63x oil objective or widefield was performed using a Leica THUNDER widefield fluorescence microscope, using a 63x oil objective and small volume computational clearing.

<p>Transmission electron microscopy was performed by Dr. Stefan Geimer at the University of Bayreuth as follows. Testis from adult mice were fixed in PBS/4% paraformaldehyde (PFA). They were then decapsulated from the tunica albuginea and the seminiferous tubules were divided into three to four pieces using a razor blade (Gillette Super Sliver). The seminiferous tubules were incubated for 60 min at RT in fixation buffer (100 mM HEPES pH7.4, 4 mM CaCl2, 2.5% glutaraldehyde, 2% PFA, all from Sigma Aldrich) and then the buffer was exchanged with fresh fixation buffer and the samples left overnight fixed at 4 °C. After washing three times for 10 min in 100 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 4 mM CaCl2, samples were post-fixed in 1% osmium tetroxide (Carl Roth, Karlsruhe, DE) in distilled water for 120 min at 4 °C. After three additional 10-min washes in distilled water, the tissue pieces were embedded in 1.5% DifcoTM Agar noble (Becton, Dickinson and Company, Sparks, MD, US) and dehydrated using increasing concentrations of ethanol. The samples were then embedded in glycidyl ether 100 (formerly Epon 812; Serva, Heidelberg, Germany) using propylene oxide as an intermediate solvent according to the standard procedure. Ultrathin sections (60-80 nm) were cut with a diamond knife (type ultra 35°; Diatome, Biel, CH) on the EM UC6 ultramicrotome (Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany) and mounted on single-slot pioloform-coated copper grids (Plano, Wetzlar, Germany). Finally, sections were stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">75</xref>].

<p>CCDC146-HA sperm (A1-A2) and epididymal WT (A3-A4) not treated or treated (5 min, 0.2% sarkosyl), were immunostained with anti-HA Ab (red) and counterstained with Hoechst (blue). (A1) Without treatment, a faint CCDC146-HA signal was observed along the CCDC146-HA principal piece. The strong staining in the midpiece is not specific (see panel B) (A2) After treatment with sarkosyl, the CCDC146- HA signal along the sperm principal piece was enhanced (white arrows), whereas the signal in the midpiece decreased. (A3) WT untreated (NT) sperm exhibited almost no CCDC146-HA signal in the principal piece. The midpiece is however strongly stained (not specific see panel B) (A4) The HA signal is not enhanced in WT principal piece by sarkosyl treatment, suggesting that the enhanced signal observed with sarkosyl on CCDC146-HA sperm is specific. (B) CCDC146-HA sperm were immunolabeled with secondary antibody only. Strong staining is observed on the midpiece, confirming its non-specific nature. Scale bars 10 μm.</p></caption>

<caption><title>Lack of CCDC146 causes centriole duplication and mislocalization in <italic>Ccdc146</italic> KO spermatids.</title>
<p>Ultrastructural analysis of centrioles in adult mouse WT (A, B) and <italic>Ccdc146</italic> KO (C-H) testis sections. (A) In WT spermatids, the proximal centriole is linked to the base of the compacting nucleus through the basal plate and the capitulum, and the distal centriole is embedded in the segmented column. These sperm-specific cytoskeletal structures make up the head-to-tail coupling apparatus (HTCA). (B) In WT elongated spermatids, the different components of the axonemal structures (microtubules and ODF) were visible downstream the distal centriole. (C) In <italic>Ccdc146</italic> KO elongating spermatids, the overall structure of the HTCA was conserved, with the presence of the centrioles and the accessory cytoskeletal structures. However, the HTCAs were often duplicated (C, E, F) and separated from their usual nuclear attachment site (C-F, H), and sometimes misplaced far away from the nucleus (F), likely preventing axoneme elongation. (F) The arrow indicates the misplaced centrioles at the end of the manchette. (G, H) In elongated spermatids with condensed nucleus, malformed and detached centrioles with poorly-assembled or missing flagella compared to the WT (B) can be seen.</p></caption>

KO spermatid nuclei showing nuclear membrane invaginations and irregular shape that were not present in the WT. The acrosome in the KO sperm appeared intact. (B, F) Spermatid nuclei in elongating spermatids. Whereas nucleus elongation is symmetric in the WT, in the <italic>CCDC146</italic>-KO, more pronounced head invaginations are observed. (C, G) Elongated spermatids. Although nuclear condensation appeared normal in both WT and KO nuclei, vacuolization is observed in KO nucleus.

<p>In this study, Muronova et al., demonstrate the physiological importance of a centriole and microtubule-associated protein, CCDC146, in sperm flagellar formation and male reproduction. In a previous study, the authors identified two loss-of-function mutations in CCDC146 from the sterile males with multiple morphological abnormalities in flagellar (MMAF) phenotype. To further test physiological significance of the CCDC146, the authors generate its knockout mouse model. The knockout males share the MMAF phenotypes with severely impaired flagellar morphology due to the defective sperm generation in testes. Using CCDC146 knock-in mouse model and expansion microscopy techniques, the authors observed CCDC146 localizes at human and mouse sperm flagella, which is different from the somatic cells. The authors also observed impaired manchette and head-tail coupling apparatus in developing spermatid lacking CCDC146 and address CCDC146 loss-of-function induces molecular and structural defects at axoneme in developing male germ cells, which finally causes MMAF phenotype and male infertility.</p>
<p>This reviewer agrees that identifying and analyzing new pathogenic molecules and variants is hugely valuable to establish male infertility in genetic level. As the authors have done, this study also enlarges the genetic causality underlying MMAF and male infertility. In addition, this study applies new techniques, expansion microscopy, which is also an innovative approach. Although many approaches are used, unfortunately, this study misses the molecular mechanisms to explain pathogenicity to cause MMAF by the CCDC146. Only intracellular localization of the molecule is heavily examined. Although the authors show defective intracellular localization of the centriole and manchette, how CCDC146 loss-of-function and the developmental defects are linked is not examined. These limits provide the impression that this study could be simply another identification of the MMAF-causing gene, which were heavily performed by the authors. Also, in many parts, the results do not clearly support the authors claim. Therefore, this reviewer thinks the current manuscript requires additional results to clearly explain molecular mechanisms underlying the pathogenicity by CCDC146 loss-of-function.</p>

<p>In whole exome sequencing of two patients suffering from MMAF syndrome, mutations of CCDC146 gene that result in premature stop codons were identified. The position of mutations could result in a truncated form of protein, thus whether these patients do indeed lack CCDC146 protein or if present, whether the truncated protein is functional, is unanswered by showing the CCDC146 protein localization only in the sperm from healthy donors. The main claim that CCDC146 protein is microtubule associated protein in the axoneme is well supported imaging expanded sperm flagellum to increase spatial resolution. However, the author's claim that the signal in the mid-piece is not specific is less supported by experimental evidence. The detection of CCDC146 in the sperm head is not further explored while TEM images show spermatogenesis defects in the manchette and acrosome formation. Increased detection of the CCDC146 protein in mouse sperm with sarkosyl supports its association with microtubules but does not exclude its potential role in the formation of sperm head. Overall, this study provides valuable information on CCDC146 function in male germ cells during spermatogenesis.</p>

<p>Male infertility is an important health problem. Among pathologies with multiple morphological abnormalities of the flagellum (MMAF), only 50% of the patients have no identified genetic causes. It is thus primordial to find novel genes that cause the MMAF syndrome. In the current work, the authors follow up the identification of two patients with MMAF carrying a mutation in the CCDC146 gene. To understand how mutations in CCDC146 lead to male infertility, the authors generated two mouse models: a CCDC146-knockout mouse, and a knockin mouse in which the CCDC146 locus is tagged with an HA tag. Male CCDC146-knockout mice are infertile, which proves the causative role of this gene in the observed MMAF cases. Strikingly, animals develop no other obvious pathologies, thus underpinning the specific role of CCDC146 in male fertility.</p>
<p>The authors have carefully characterised the subcellular roles of CCDC146 by using a combination of expansion and electron microscopy. They demonstrate that all microtubule-based organelles, such as the sperm manchette, the centrioles, as well as the sperm axonemes are defective when CCDC146 is absent. Their data show that CCDC146 is a microtubule-associated protein, and indicate, but do not prove beyond any doubt, that it could be a microtubule-inner protein (MIP).</p>

This is a solid work that defines CCDC146 as a novel cause of male infertility. The authors have performed comprehensive phenotypic analysis to define the defects in CCDC146 knockout mice. Surprisingly, the authors provide virtually no information on the penetrance of those defects - in most cases they simply show descriptive micrographs. The message of this manuscript would have been more convincing if the key phenotypes of the CCDC146 knockout mice were quantified, in particular those shown in Fig. 2E, 7A, 11B, 13.</p>
<p>The manuscript text is well written and easy to follow also for non-specialists. The introduction and discussion chapters contain important background information that allow putting the current work into the greater context of fertility research. The figures could have been designed more carefully, with additional information on the genotype and other details such as the antibodies used etc. directly added to the figure panels, which would improve their readability. The author might also consider pooling small figures with complementary content into one bigger figure in order to group related information together, and again facilitate the reading of the manuscript.</p>
<p>Overall, this manuscript provides convincing evidence for CCDC146 being essential for male fertility, and illustrates this with a large panel of phenotypic observations, which however mostly lack quantification in order to judge their penetrance. Together, the work provides important first insights into the role of a so-far unexplored proteins, CCDC146, in spermatogenesis, thereby broadening the spectrum of genes involved in male infertility.</p>
