<abstract>
<title>Abstract</title><p>Identification of new binding targets is essential for the development of herbicides and phytotoxin-tolerant crops. Caprylic acid (CAP) is a safe and non-selective bio-herbicide in uncultivated areas. However, the herbicidal action of CAP remains unclear. Herein, metabolomic and proteomic profiling indicated that a serine hydroxymethyl transferase in <italic>Conyza canadensis</italic> (<italic>Cc</italic>SHMT1) is a promising candidate binding targeted for CAP. The protein abundance and activity of <italic>Cc</italic>SHMT1 were decreased in a time- and dosage-dependent manners after CAP treatment. CAP competes with phenyl-serine at the binding sites, decreasing the enzymatic activity of <italic>Cc</italic>SHMT1. Overexpression of <italic>CcSHMT1, AtSHMT1</italic> and <italic>OsSHMT1</italic> in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> or rice endowed plants with high tolerance to CAP treatment, whereas the knockout of <italic>osshmt1</italic> led to death of plants under normal atmospheric conditions. Furthermore, T194A, T194A/ M195V and D209N <italic>Osshmt1</italic> mutant plants derived from base editing exhibited tolerance to CAP. CAP bound to <italic>Cc</italic>SHMT1 with high affinity, and Ala191 in the key domains of N-terminus was identified to be critical for the binding site of CAP. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that <italic>Cc</italic>SHMT1 is a binding target for herbicidal activity of CAP. This study marks a key step in the druggability of SHMT inhibitors and represents an attractive target for phytotoxin-tolerant crops.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Herbicide application is the most effective and affordable weed management strategy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Gerhards et al. 2011</xref>). However, of the 25 known herbicide targets, weeds resistant to 21 targets have been reported, including 267 weed species that often appear in 96 crops (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Foucart and Horel 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Heap 2023</xref>). To overcome this challenge, application of new herbicides with novel modes of action is a good strategy to overcome or delay herbicide resistance. However, very few novel herbicidal targets have been discovered in recent decades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Duke and Dayan 2022</xref>).</p>
<p>Phytotoxins have emerged as novel herbicide candidates targeting distinct plant processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Macias et al. 2019</xref>). Several medium-chain fatty acids, such as pelargonic acid (CH₃(CH₂)₇CO₂H), were identified as effective, broad-spectrum phytotoxins with low risk for development of herbicide resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Coleman and Penner 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Real et al. 2021</xref>). The mechanisms of action of phytotoxins can be divided into non-specific and specific modes of action, similar to other abiotic stresses (salinity or alkalinity stress) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Zhu 2016</xref>). We recently investigated caprylic acid (C<sub>8</sub>H<sub>16</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, CAP), which exhibits high herbicidal activity by destroying chloroplasts and mitochondria in leaf cells and is a potent herbicide against weeds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Li et al. 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Li et al. 2019b</xref>). High doses of CAP typically destroy plant plasma membranes via lipid peroxidation, increasing singlet oxygen production and peroxidation reactions and causing necrosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Fukuda et al. 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Lederer et al. 2004</xref>). These study presented a non-specific mode of action. However, the initial target enzymes of CAP remain unclear. The herbicidal binding targets of CAP maybe novel for uncovering a specific mode of action of phytotoxicity.</p>
<p>A combination of modern molecular, structural, and genomic technologies is considered as one of the best approaches for identifying herbicide targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Duke et al. 2019</xref>). Structural analyses have shown that <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana,</italic> acetohydroxyacid synthase (AHAS) form tight complexes with pyrimidinyl-benzoate (PYB) and sulfonylamino-carbonyl-triazolinone (SCT) herbicides, providing a structural basis for designing new AHAS-targeting herbicides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Garcia et al. 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Lonhienne et al. 2020</xref>). High-throughput screening of target enzymes has been employed to identify novel herbicides such as aspterric acid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Lein et al. 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Yan et al. 2018</xref>). Proteomics has been used to confirm low enzyme-level molecular sites of natural herbicidal compounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Dayan et al. 2020</xref>). However, using these approaches to identify novel herbicidal targets is still scarce.</p>
<p>In a previous study, we identified 112 differentially expressed proteins in CAP-treated <italic>Conyza canadensis</italic>, including G0WXY7, A0A103TF61 and A0A124SCM3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Li et al. 2019a</xref>). However, the exact binding targets of CAP were not discerned. In the present study, we used untargeted metabolomics to identify different metabolites after CAP treatment, including glycine, palmitic acid and vanillin. We then co-analyzed the proteomic and metabolomic data to narrow down the candidate CAP targets, including SHMT1, FBA5, PGK3, PGK2, PGM1, GLO1, CYFBP, ADK2, and PED1. These analyses identified a serine hydroxymethyl transferase of <italic>C. canadensis</italic> (<italic>Cc</italic>SHMT1) as a potential herbicide target of CAP. To validate this, we analyzed <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and rice lines overexpressing heterologous <italic>CcSHMT1</italic> with CAP. Subsequently, the coding sequences of <italic>OsSHMT1</italic> were <italic>in vivo</italic> edited to obtain tolerant crops using base editing. The homology modeling structure of <italic>Cc</italic>SHMT1, which shows 87.97% sequence identity with that of <italic>At</italic>SHMT2 (PDB: 6SMN.1.A), was used for <italic>in silico</italic> docking of CAP to identify the amino acid residues that are critical for binding. The present study uncovered a CAP-binding target enzyme and provided an integrated theoretical framework for herbicidal target discovery.</p>

<p>The phytotoxic symptoms appeared after 4 h treatment at the 625 μM CAP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Li et al. 2019c</xref>). To identify the targets of CAP, we first employed untargeted metabolomics to analyze the significantly different metabolites at 4 h post-treatment by 625 μM CAP from the untreatment. Principal component analysis (PCA) and multivariate score plots of all the samples and quality controls (QCs) showed a reliable trend of intergroup separation (R<sub>2</sub>X= 0.577&gt; 0.5), good predictive power, and goodness-of-fit (Supplemental Table 1S and Fig. 1S). Differentially expressed metabolites (DEMs) were defined using two major parameters: a variable influence on projection (VIP) &gt;1 and Student’s t-test <italic>p</italic>-value &lt; 0.05. CAP treatment resulted in 151 DEMs (100 upregulated, 51 downregulated) at 4 h post-treatment relative to the untreated controls (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>, Supplemental Table 2S). The DEMs were enriched in various amino acid metabolic pathways, including carbon fixation in photosynthetic organisms, carbon metabolism, and glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>). The amino acid metabolic pathways of Val, Leu, and Ile and Gly, Ser, and Thr biosynthesis are closely associated with glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism pathways. Our previous proteomic analysis showed that the abundance of 112 proteins either increased or decreased after CAP treatment, and among these proteins, among which G0WXY7 (Ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase large chain, involved in carbohydrate metabolism), A0A103TF61 (Aspartic peptidase, involved in hydrolase activity) and A0A124SCM3 (Electron transport accessory protein-like domain-containing protein, involved in photosystem I) exhibited the most pronounced changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Li et al. 2019a</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>The availability of both proteomic data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Li et al. 2019a</xref>) and metabolomic data prompted us to perform a comparative KEGG pathway analysis. KEGG pathway enrichment analysis showed that the proteins and metabolites that changed after CAP treatment were mainly enriched in 10 pathways, including carbon fixation in photosynthetic organisms, amino acid biosynthesis, and carbon metabolism (<italic>P</italic>&lt; 0.05) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>). The expression of nine genes (<italic>SHMT1</italic>, <italic>FBA5</italic>, <italic>PGK3</italic>, <italic>PGK2</italic>, <italic>PGM1</italic>, <italic>GLO1</italic>, <italic>CYFBP</italic>, <italic>ADK2</italic>, and <italic>PED1</italic>), which are known to participate in the top eight pathways, was significantly different between CAP-treated samples and untreated controls. The occurrence frequency of all these genes that appeared at least once in the top eight KEGG enriched pathways was increased by 20% according to the standard calculating module. The standard calculation module is similar to the occurrence frequency of herbicide resistance as an indicator of harmful and resistant weeds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Walsh et al 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Notably, a serine hydroxymethyltransferase 1 (<italic>CcSHMT1</italic>) showed the highest frequency among the nine genes and was involved in six of the eight pathways in <italic>C. canadensis</italic> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>). SHMT1 plays a role in photorespiration and metabolic conversion of glycine to serine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Douce et al 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bauwe and Kolukisaoglu 2003</xref>). Specially, two amino acids were significantly decreased after CAP treatment (Supplemental Fig. 2S). Hence, multiple omics analyses suggested that <italic>Cc</italic>SHMT1 is the most likely binding target of CAP.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2b">
<title>CAP inhibited SHMT activity but upregulated <italic>CcSHMT1</italic> expression</title>
<p>Subsequently, we assessed transcriptional alterations in <italic>SHMT</italic> genes and SHMT enzyme activity in <italic>C. canadensis</italic> to corroborate the omics results. We first characterized one of the <italic>C. canadensis SHMT</italic> gene, <italic>CcSHMT1</italic> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig.2A</xref>), which is highly similar to its orthologs in other plant species (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig.2B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Lakhssassi et al. 2019</xref>). The protein-coding region of <italic>CcSHMT1</italic> was 1,542 bp in length (MN586851.1), encoding a protein of 513 amino acids with a molecular weight of 56.994 kDa and a theoretical pI of 8.82. <italic>Cc</italic>SHMT1 was located in the mitochondria, with GFP fluorescence overlapping with Mito fluorescence, which was identical to that reported for SHMT1(<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Wang et al. 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Spalding et al. 2010</xref>; Zhou et al. 2015). In addition, we resolved the homology model structure of <italic>Cc</italic>SHMT1 in AlphaFold2 (Baek et al. 2021). The homologous structure showed 88.03% sequence identity with <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> SHMT2 structure (PDB: 6SMN). The overall three-dimensional (3D) homologous structure of <italic>Cc</italic>SHMT1 forms a tetramer with four identical subunits. The monomer contained three domains: N-terminal, large domain, and C-terminal (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>). Hence, <italic>Cc</italic>SHMT1 is a typical PLP domain-containing enzyme.</p>

</fig>
<p>A quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) assay showed that the transcription level of <italic>CcSHMT1</italic> was elevated more than five-fold within 30 min after CAP treatment. A few other genes were also upregulated to some degree, including <italic>FBA5</italic>, <italic>PGK3</italic>, <italic>PGM1,</italic> and a homolog of <italic>At1g56190</italic>, but to much smaller magnitudes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). Additionally, <italic>CcSHMT1</italic> was only upregulated for a short time, as its transcription level peaked at 1 h after CAP treatment and then sharply decreased to a steady-state level 2 h after treatment (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>). We also measured the protein level of soluble SHMT in <italic>C. canadensis</italic> using a commercially available SHMT ELISA kit (Mei5 Biotech., Beijing, China). The total SHMT protein level increased gradually from 0.5 h to 2 h post-treatment, reaching its highest level (364.53 U/L) at 2 h, and then began to decrease (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>). These results suggested that induction of <italic>CcSHMT1</italic> was a transient response to CAP treatment.</p>

<p>Using the same <italic>C. canadensis</italic> samples, the total SHMT activity was examined based on the production rate of benzaldehyde. SHMT activity decreased gradually to 17.331 μmol phenylserine·min<sup>-1</sup>·mg<sup>-1</sup> protein after treatment of 78.125 μM CAP, compared with untreated samples (19.901 μmol phenylserine·min<sup>-1</sup>·mg<sup>-1</sup> protein) and Vanillic acid (VA, C<sub>8</sub>H<sub>8</sub>O<sub>4</sub>) treated samples (21.080 μmol phenylserine·min<sup>-1</sup>·mg<sup>-1</sup> protein), and CAP inhibited SHMT activity in a dose-dependent manner (from 78.125 μM to 1250 μM) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>). However, the activity of the photorespiratory GLO1, the transcript levels of which showed similar changes as SHMT1 under CAP treatment <italic>in vivo</italic>, was not significantly inhibited by CAP (Supplemental Fig. 3S). Taken together, these data indicated that CAP treatment induced transcription of <italic>CcSHMT1</italic>, which was positively correlated with higher protein level during a brief post-treatment time window.</p>
<p>To determine whether CAP could inhibit the enzymatic activity of SHMT <italic>in vitro</italic>, <italic>Cc</italic>SHMT1 was expressed in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> and purified using Ni<sup>2+</sup>-chelating columns (Supplemental <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig.4S</xref>).

<title>Overexpression of <italic>CcSHMT1</italic> in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and rice increased resistance to CAP</title>
<p>To verify whether CAP targets <italic>Cc</italic>SHMT1, we transformed <italic>CcSHMT1</italic> into <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and rice plants. Transgenic <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (At<italic>CcSHMT1</italic>-OE) and rice (Os<italic>CcSHMT1-</italic>OE) were confirmed using PCR (Supplemental <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig.6S</xref>). RT-qPCR assays showed that the transcription level of <italic>SHTM1</italic> was highly increased in the At<italic>CcSHMT1</italic>-OE and Os<italic>CcSHMT1-</italic>OE lines (Supplemental Fig. 7S). To optimize the concentration of CAP for the treatment of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, At<italic>CcSHMT1</italic>-OE, Os<italic>CcSHMT1-</italic>OE, and wild type (WT) seedlings were treated with CAP at different concentrations. Upon treatment with CAP at 316 μM, two At<italic>CcSHMT1</italic>-OE lines did not show visible injury, while the WT plants were severely injured and did not survive beyond 7 days post-treatment (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>). For the two independent At<italic>CcSHMT1</italic>-OE lines, the half-maximal effective concentration (EC<sub>50</sub>) of CAP was 376.3 μM (At<italic>CcSHMT1</italic>-OE1) and 413.9 μM (At<italic>CcSHMT1</italic>-OE2), whereas the EC<sub>50</sub> for WT plants was 190.8 μM (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>, Supplemental Table 3S). Upon seed treatment of CAP at 25 μM, the two At<italic>CcSHMT1</italic>-OE lines germinated normally, while the WT plants were severely injured and did not survive beyond 7 days post-treatment (Supplemental Fig. 8S). In line with the increased expression of <italic>SHMT1</italic> in At<italic>CcSHMT1</italic>-OE lines, SHMT concentrations were also elevated in At<italic>CcSHMT1</italic>-OE plants compared to WT plants after CAP treatment, although the concentration of SHMT decreased when high concentrations of CAP were applied (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>). Interestingly, the phenotype of the Os<italic>CcSHMT1</italic>-OE lines was similar to that of the At<italic>CcSHMT1</italic>-OE lines under CAP treatment.

For the two independent Os<italic>CcSHMT1</italic>-OE lines, the EC<sub>50</sub> values of CAP were 2.415 mM (Os<italic>Cc</italic>SHMT1<italic>-</italic> OE20) and 2.766 mM (Os<italic>Cc</italic>SHMT1<italic>-</italic>OE26), whereas that EC<sub>50</sub> of WT plants was 1.675 mM (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E</xref>, Supplemental Table 4S).

<p>Interestingly, the knock-out of <italic>OsSHMT1</italic> in rice led to mutant lines grow abnormally and show a typical photorespiratory phenotype (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>, Supplemental Fig. 10S), similar to the findings of Wang (2015). To further confirm that SHMT1 was the binding target of CAP, we cloned <italic>OsSHMT1</italic> and overexpressed it in rice. RT-qPCR assays showed that the transcription level of <italic>SHTM1</italic> was highly increased in <italic>OsSHMT1-</italic>OE lines (Os<italic>SHMT1-</italic>OE9 and Os<italic>SHMT1-</italic>OE13) (Supplemental Fig. 9S). The <italic>Os</italic>SHMT1-OE had similarly trends with At<italic>SHMT1</italic>-OE under CAP treated.

<p>To comprehensively explore whether SHMT1 is the binding target of CAP and to obtain CAP-tolerant rice plants, the <italic>OsSHMT1</italic> was delimited as the target region for mutagenesis by base editing. The 7<sup>th</sup> extron of <italic>OsSHMT1</italic> was high conservative among the SHMT1 in the other plants (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Lakhssassi et al. 2019</xref>). A total of 29 guides harboring the NGN PAM were designed in 7<sup>th</sup> extron using CRISPR-GE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Xie et al. 2017</xref>) and cloned into evoCDA1, evoAPOBEC1, and TadA8e base editors in the nSpRYCas9 backbone (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Wang et al. 2022</xref>). These base-editing pools generated dozens of transgenic plantlets with 25 different genotypes (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref>, Supplemental Fig. 11S). Some mutant lines (Y197C, L198S, T203I, and R198G) did not grow normally and died after transplanting into the soil, indicating the lethal effect of these mutations (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C</xref>). T-DNA free and homozygous mutant lines with the remaining mutations in the T<sub>1</sub> generation were further evaluated for CAP tolerance and agronomic traits (Supplemental Fig. 12S). Most tested genotypes were not significantly different from the WT (Supplemental Fig. 13S). Only three genotypes (T194A, T194A/M195V, and D209N) exhibited tolerance to CAP, whereas WT plants died 3 days after 2.78 mM CAP treatment (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6D</xref>). For the three independent T194A, T194A/M195V, and D209N mutants, the EC<sub>50</sub> of CAP was 2.791, 3.378, and 2.514 mM, respectively, whereas the EC<sub>50</sub> for WT plants was 1.675 mM (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6E</xref>, Supplemental Table 4S). Field agronomic trait test exhibited that the CAP-tolerance of the genotypes did not affect plant height, tiller number, or 1000-grain weight. However, the seed-setting rate decreased significantly, indicating a potential fitness cost for CAP-resistant (Supplemental Fig. 14S). The SHMT activity was also elevated in three independent T194A, T194A/M195V, and D209N mutant plants compared to the WT plants after CAP treatment, although the activity of SHMT decreased when high concentrations of CAP were applied (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6F</xref>). Altogether, <italic>OsSHMT1</italic> T194A, T194A/M195V, and D209N mutations enhanced CAP-resistance in rice, further supporting the idea that SHMT1 may be the binding target of CAP.</p>

<title>CAP bound to <italic>Cc</italic>SHMT1</title>
<p>To understand how CAP inhibited enzymatic activity of <italic>Cc</italic>SHMT1, docking analysis was employed to reveal favorable binding affinity between CAP and homology modeling structure of <italic>Cc</italic>SHMT1(affinity: Q=-4.52 kcal/mol, rmsd=1.448&lt;3.5) (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7A</xref>, Supplemental Fig. 15S). The hydroxyl-hydrogen atom of Ser190 forms hydrogen bonds with the carboxyl group of CAP at a distance of 2.9 Å. Ala191 and Val192 also formed hydrogen bonds with carboxyl group of CAP, with distances of 2.5 and 2.4 Å, respectively. The short distances between CAP and the homology modeled structure of <italic>Cc</italic>SHMT1 may be responsible for its favorable binding affinity. Interestingly, the Ser190, Ala191, and Val192 were located in the 7<sup>th</sup> extron of <italic>OsSHMT1</italic>. To further verify the CAP binding sites, the <italic>Cc</italic>SHMT1 mutants by site-directed mutagenesis were expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic> (Supplemental Fig. 16S). Microscale thermophoresis (MST) analysis of the wild type and <italic>Cc</italic>SHMT1 mutants was used to validate the docking results (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7B</xref>). Non-mutated <italic>Cc</italic>SHMT1 and CAP showed high binding affinities (K<sub>d</sub>=12.3 μM). No binding of VA to <italic>Cc</italic>SHMT1 up to 50 μM was detected (Supplemental Fig. 17S). When Ser190 and Val192 were mutated to Ala190 and Leu192, CAP binding was slightly impeded (K<sub>d</sub>= 15.5 μM and K<sub>d</sub> = 28.00 μM, respectively). In contrast, mutation of Ala191 to Thr191 resulted in a reduced binding (K<sub>d</sub>= 51.9 μM). Furthermore, the <italic>in vitro</italic> enzymatic activity assay results of the mutated enzyme agreed with those of the MST analysis (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7C</xref>). There was no significant difference between Ser190Ala (190.13 μmol phenylserine·min<sup>-1</sup>·mg<sup>-</sup> <sup>1</sup> protein) and Val192Leu (197.83 μmol phenylserine·min<sup>-1</sup>·mg<sup>-1</sup> protein) site mutations on SHMT enzymatic activity, but the Ala191Thr (154.97 μmol phenylserine·min<sup>-1</sup>·mg<sup>-1</sup> protein) and three-site mutant (166.30 μmol phenylserine·min<sup>-1</sup>·mg<sup>-1</sup> protein) were decreased when compare with non-mutation <italic>Cc</italic>SHMT1 (193.35 μmol phenylserine·min<sup>-1</sup>·mg<sup>-1</sup> protein) without CAP treatment. In addition, there was no significant difference between the Ser190Ala and Val192Leu site mutations, but the Ala191Thr site mutation prevented CAP-induced inhibition of <italic>Cc</italic>SHMT1. Collectively, the data indicate that CAP binds to the key site of <italic>Cc</italic>SHMT1 and that Ala191 provides a critical interaction that is disrupted when mutated to Thr191.</p>

Combinatorial analysis of untargeted metabolomic and proteomic profiles revealed nine candidate proteins involved in eight different pathways. Among these candidate proteins, SHMT1 had the highest frequency in the top eight KEGG pathways (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.1C</xref>). <italic>Cc</italic>SHMT1 also showed the highest significantly changed in CAP-responsive expression (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). Several lines of evidence suggest that <italic>Cc</italic>SHMT1 serves as a target for CAP herbicidal activity in <italic>C. canadensis</italic>. First, overexpression of <italic>Cc</italic>SHMT1 conferred CAP resistance in transgenic <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and rice, suggesting that excess <italic>Cc</italic>SHMT1 is the direct target of CAP (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). Second, both <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments confirmed that CAP inhibits SHMT enzyme activity, and this inhibition is competitive, as shown by <italic>in vitro</italic> kinetics assays (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D-F</xref>). Third, the mutant plants harboring T194A, T194A/M195V, and D199N mutations exhibited tolerance to CAP, whereas the WT plants died after CAP treatment (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C</xref>). Four, structural modeling suggested high affinity binding of <italic>Cc</italic>SHMT1 to CAP, and the critical amino acids for this interaction were experimentally verified (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>). Our experimental evidence suggests that <italic>Cc</italic>SHMT1 is an authentic binding target of CAP, which explains its herbicidal activity against <italic>C. canadensis</italic>.</p>
<p>The amino acid biosynthesis enzymes are one of the most promising herbicide target (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Heap 2023</xref>). SHMT1, which plays a role in photorespiration and metabolic conversion of glycine to serine, is also an important enzyme for survival or death in response to biotic and abiotic stresses in plants (Hu et al. 2022; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Liu et al. 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">McClung et al 2000</xref>). In <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, <italic>AtSHMT1</italic> (At4g37930) is necessary and sufficient for SHMT-dependent photorespiration and controls abiotic stress-induced cell damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Voll et al. 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Moreno et al. 2005</xref>). Our data showed that knock out or base editing of <italic>OsSHMT1</italic> in rice led to the abnormally growth of mutant lines and a typical photorespiratory phenotype (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>). Similarly, photorespiratory <italic>shmt</italic> mutants grow slower than WT plants under normal atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> conditions and are hypersensitive to abiotic stress (Moreno J.I. et al. 2005). Meanwhile, CAP is a competitive inhibitor of <italic>Cc</italic>SHMT1 with Ser (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig.3</xref>), and has a structure similar to that of CAP and Ser, resulting in leaf chlorosis and plant death. Indeed, a slow inhibition rate could herald comparatively high dosages. The recommended usage of CAP in the field was further confirmed by the SHMT activity inhibition rate data (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig.3E</xref>). Similarly, the comparatively lower dosage of branched-chain amino acid biosynthesis inhibitors were significantly specific inhibited the binding targets, such as acetolactate synthase (ALS, EC 2.2.1.6) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Dezfulian et al. 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Gil-Monreal et al. 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Fuchs et al. 2021</xref>). Therefore, SHMT1 is an amino acid biosynthesis target and get inhibited by CAP.</p>
<p>Similarly, determination of the binding site is essential for the discovery of novel herbicides target and the creation of herbicide-resistant crops (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Pfister and Arntzen 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Schloss 2010</xref>). Molecular docking predicted how CAP fits into the binding site of homology modeling structure of <italic>Cc</italic>SHMT1, and the amino acid Ala191 was found to be essential for CAP binding (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig.7</xref>). Surprisingly, Ala191 is located at N-terminal domain in the <italic>At</italic>SHMT2 structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Nogues I et al. 2022</xref>). Similarly, the Thr183, Asn356, and Thr357 residues in Plasmodial SHMT, also located in the N-terminal domain, establish strong hydrogen bonds with the pyran ring of carboxylate (2-(1-(3-(6-amino-5-cyano-3-methyl-2,4-dihydropy rano[2,3-c]pyrazol-4-yl)-7-fluoro-2,2-dimethyl-2,3-dihydro-1H-inden-5-yl) piperidin-4-yl)acetic acid). Such alternative bonds to the pyran ring can potentially be introduced in novel SHMT inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Schwertz G et al. 2018</xref>). More recently, the AS-IE method was applied to analyze the binding pocket of SHMT2 to 28 different SHMT2-inhibitor complexes. Tyr105 and Arg425 are also located in the N-terminal domain and have been found to be major contributors to the total binding free energy (He LP et al. 2019). These previous reports show that the binding sites of CAP are located at the key domains of known SHMT monomers, that is, the Ser-binding pocket at the N-terminus. Interestingly, three genotypes (T194A, T194A/M195V, and D209N) exhibited tolerance to CAP while WT plants died three days after 2.78 mM CAP treatment (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6D</xref>). The T194 and D209 are also located in the 7<sup>th</sup> extron of the N-terminal domain. Hence, the 7<sup>th</sup> extron of SHMT1 at N-terminal domain is the key binding site of CAP, which reveals a novel mode of action and herbicide-resistant crop.</p>
<p>Multiple separate targets are widespread in the natural compounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Chen HS et al. 2017</xref>). One hypothesis might explain how multiple changes occur in weeds and the low level of resistance in crops, which is possible because CAP has multiple separate targets in weeds. Unexpectedly, two <italic>Cc</italic>SHMT1 overexpressing lines enhanced the resistance level, whereas the site-directed mutagenesis plants were more severely injured than the WT plants seven days post-treatment with CAP (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5G</xref>). Normally, site-directed mutagenesis of the active site confers tolerance to the inhibitor as the binding affinity decreases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Kandoth PK et al. 2017</xref>). However, some studies have reported that mutations lead to sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Beard and Wilson 1994</xref>). Similarly, the signaling-sensitive M637W, S641A, and Y667A thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor (TSHR) exhibited 25-50% activity compared to the WT and led to a constitutively active receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Kleinau G et al. 2010</xref>). <italic>A. thaliana shm1-1</italic> mutants are more susceptible to infection by biotrophic and necrotrophic plant pathogens and accumulate more H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> than WT plants under salt stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Moreno et al., 2005</xref>). Indeed, the structures of all known SHMTs are extensively similar, and are either homodimers or homotetramers of monomers with similar molecular masses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Nogues I et al. 2022</xref>). Obviously, the functional redundancy of SHMT is commonly observed in plants under stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Anderson DD et al. 2009</xref>). The 3D model of SHMT could be docked with various substrates, inhibitors and co-factors alone or in combination to analyze the structural change(s) in different SHMT complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Trivedi et al. 2002</xref>). The central role of SHMT isozymes in producing one-carbon-substituted folate cofactors suggests that these enzymes (isozymes) influence photorespiration and therefore could serve as herbicide targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Witschel 2012</xref>). SHMT1 is a member of the SHMT family, which has five SHMTs in rice and seven SHMTs in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>; thus, there might be redundant proteins of SHMT1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Moreno et al. 2005</xref>; Yan MY et al. 2022). Therefore, the <italic>Cc</italic>SHMT1 is the binding target of CAP and the other targets of CAP may exist.</p>
<p>Most successful long-established targets involve more than one molecule or possess targets that are used against multi-resistant weeds (Gray and Wenzel 2020). In the case of <italic>C. canadensis</italic>, multiple resistance has been reported, making it difficult to control this weed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Heap, 2023</xref>). For instance, mutations in the 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase (EPSPS) gene, such as P106T, and mutations in the acetolactate synthase (ALS) gene, such as P197A, have been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Amaro-Blanco I et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Mora DA et al., 2019</xref>). These studies on target sites are very well done to identify herbicide targeting amino acid sequences in natural populations. In our study, we obtained mutant populations by base-editing the 7<sup>th</sup> exon of the <italic>Os</italic>SHMT1 gene. Fortunately, three genotypes (T194A, T194A/M195V, and D209N) exhibited tolerance to the herbicide CAP, while wild-type plants died three days after treatment with 2.78 mM CAP (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6D</xref>). Although more variations of SHMT1 are needed to determine whether they confer higher CAP-tolerance, this target site mutant also supports the herbicide targeting mechanism effectively. Similarly, mutations in the EPSPS gene, such as D213N, and mutations in the ALS gene, such as P171F, confer reliable resistance to glyphosate and nicosulfuron in rice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Zhang R. et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Zhang C. et al., 2023</xref>).</p>
<p>Interestingly, SHMT1 is involved in six out of the eight pathways in <italic>C. canadensis</italic>, including carbon fixation in photosynthetic organisms, amino acid biosynthesis, and carbon metabolism (P&lt;0.05) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1D</xref>). The targets it possesses are encoded by multiple genes (Brazel and Maoileidiah 2019). Compounds that bind to multiple proteins as targeting mechanisms make the evolution of target-site resistance mechanisms more challenging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Gaines TA et al., 2020</xref>). Therefore, SHMT1 can be utilized to combat multi-resistant weeds and is a promising target for herbicide development and herbicide-tolerant crops.</p>
<p>In summary, CAP competitively binds to the key domain of <italic>Cc</italic>SHMT1, disrupting SHMT function and resulting in the inhibition of <italic>C. canadensis</italic> growth (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig.8</xref>). The studies presented herein provide a novel integral framework for herbicide binding target identification and the development of novel SHMT-targeting inhibitors. In the future, CAP-based inhibitors that can inhibit all SHMT isoforms or other target proteins as well as CAP-tolerant crops will be developed.</p>

<caption><title>Model of Caprylic acid inhibition of SHMT1 to subdue weeds and tolerant crop.</title><p>Under normal conditions, SHMT1 catalyzes the reversible interconversion of serine and glycine. The non-mutation <italic>Cc</italic>SHMT1 showed good binding affinities with caprylic acid. In normal <italic>CcSHMT1</italic> plants, caprylic acid competitively binds to the key domains (Ser190, Ala191, and Vla192) of <italic>Cc</italic>SHMT1, thus disturbing SHMT function and resulting in the inhibition of <italic>C. canadensis</italic> growth. In the overexpression <italic>CcSHMT1</italic> plants, caprylic acid competitively binds to the key site of <italic>Cc</italic>SHMT1. However, serine can still be converted to glycine in surplus <italic>Cc</italic>SHMT1, resulting in higher crop survival rates. In the mutant <italic>OsSHMT1</italic> plants, we obtained the T194A, T194A/ M195V, and D209N site mutant lines. Caprylic acid cannot competitively bind to the key site (Ser190, Ala191, and Vla192) of <italic>Cc</italic>SHMT1. Serine can be converted into glycine, resulting in higher crop survival rates.

<p>Caprylic acid (CAP), i.e., octanoic acid, is a saturated fatty acid. CAP is commonly used as a food contact surface sanitizer. In mammals, caprylic acid is related to hunger sensation (i.e., food consumption). serine hydroxymethyl transferase (SHMT) has been previously known as a potential herbicidal target. The present study involves a huge amount of work. The results are useful and contribute well to the literature. The data does support the conclusion. It does not seem that SHMT is the only target of CAP though (CAP may act on other proteins as well). A major deficiency of this manuscript is that there are many unclear, inaccurate, or unconcise descriptions.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Li et al. investigated the mechanism of action of an important herbicide, caprylic acid (CAP). The authors used untargeted metabolomics to find out differently expressed metabolites (DEM). It led to the identification of metabolites involved in amino acid metabolism, carbon fixation, carbon, glyoxylate, and dicarboxylate metabolism. Using previously published proteomics data and the newly conducted metabolomics data, the authors identified a serine hydroxymethyl transferase in Conyza canadensis (CcSHMT1) to be a likely candidate for CAP inhibition.</p>
<p>The authors conducted a series of in vitro and in vivo tests to elucidate the effect of CAP on SHMT1 inhibition. Plants overexpressing SHMT1 were used to analyze the effect of SHMT1 expression, activity, and inhibition, among others. Purified SHMT1 was used to elucidate enzyme kinetics in the presence or absence of inhibitors. CRISPR-based editing was a powerful method of investigating the effect of SHMT1 mutants on CAP application and complements the overexpression and in vitro studies. Finally, computational docking of CAP on SHMT1 was conducted to identify key interacting residues. The results are overall consistent with one another and present a unified framework for CAP activity as an herbicide. Unexpected variations in SHMT1 expression and activity levels upon CAP treatment suggest complex biological compensatory mechanisms in response to SHMT1 deficiency. Further studies are needed to understand the effect of these perturbations that will be required to successfully develop and deploy CAP-resistant crops for widespread use in agriculture. In conclusion, the authors did a commendable job of elucidating SHMT1 as a biologically relevant target for CAP.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>- Combines computational docking, enzyme kinetics using purified proteins, and several different model plant species and two different methods of testing (overexpression and base editing) to establish plant response and survival.</p>
<p>- Sound experimental designs and the presence of controls validate the results and provide additional confidence in the authors' conclusions.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>- Relied too heavily on the study of plants overexpressing SHMT1, which do not have native gene regulation, and this might limit the generalizability of their conclusions.</p>
<p>-The authors did not leverage computational docking analysis to validate or seek corroboration of the performance of plant alleles obtained from the base editing experiments.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Li et al investigated the initial target of the herbicidal caprilic acid (CAP). Using a combination of proteomic and metabolomic approaches, they generated a list of candidate targets for CAP and identified a Serine hydroxymethyl transferase (SHMT) as the best candidate.</p>
<p>CAP application to Conyza canadensis induces an early and brief increase in SHMT1 protein and transcript. Studies with purified recombinant CcSHMT1 indicate that enzymatic activity is inhibited by CAP. The authors suggest a kinetic mechanism of CAP inhibition but more data should be collected to reach a firm conclusion on this point.</p>
<p>Transgenic Arabidopsis and rice plants expressing CcSHMT1 show increased tolerance to CAP, as measured by biomass reduction 7 days after treatment with CAP. Similar results were obtained with Arabidopsis and rice plants overexpressing AtSHMT2 and OsSHMT1, respectively. OsSHMT1 single and double mutant rice plants showed increased tolerance to CAP. These results strongly link CAP tolerance to the level of SHMT, which can be manipulated by transgenesis, and suggest that engineered SHMT can also lead to higher CAP tolerance.</p>
<p>Finally, structural analysis allowed the identification of three residues close to the active site involved in the binding of CAP. Arabidopsis plants containing AtSHMT2 modified in these three residues are more sensitive to CAP.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The work of Li et al. includes a large number of assays using different methodologies. The evidence suggests that SHMT inhibition by CAP is effective in inhibiting plant growth. In addition, new technologies that manipulate SHMT levels or activity may improve crop yield by controlling weeds. Structural analysis can be the starting point for the design of more complex molecules that exceed the herbicidal activity of CAP.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The methods are rather incomplete, lacking many details necessary to fully understand the author's reasoning. It is not possible to reproduce the experiments on the basis of the information provided.</p>
<p>Although the conclusions are generally well supported, the results are presented in an incorrect or confusing manner. In the comparison of wild-type and transgenic plants, the control condition is missing in some experiments (Figures 4A and 5A). In some plots, the scales are not logical, making them difficult to interpret and fit into an equation (Figures 4B, 4C, 4E, 5E, 6E, 6F).</p>
<p>A final concern is the finding that some point mutations in the SHMT1 gene lead to more tolerant plants (Figures 6D, 6E, 6F). The authors could then explain whether this means that resistance to CAP could be easily acquired by weeds.</p>
