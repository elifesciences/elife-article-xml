<title>Abstract</title><p>The control of gluconeogenesis is critical for glucose homeostasis and the pathology of type 2 diabetes (T2D). Here, we uncover a novel function of TET2 in the regulation of gluconeogenesis. In mice, both fasting and a high-fat diet (HFD) stimulate the expression of TET2, and TET2 knockout impairs glucose production. Mechanistically, FBP1, a rate-limiting enzyme in gluconeogenesis, is positively regulated by TET2 in liver cells. TET2 is recruited by HNF4α, contributing to the demethylation of FBP1 promoter and activating its expression in response to glucagon stimulation. Moreover, metformin treatment increases the phosphorylation of HNF4α on Ser313, which prevents its interaction with TET2, thereby decreasing the expression level of FBP1 and ameliorating the pathology of T2D. Collectively, we identify an HNF4α-TET2-FBP1 axis in the control of gluconeogenesis, which contributes to the therapeutic effect of metformin on T2D and provides a potential target for the clinical treatment of T2D.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Loss of glucose homeostasis can lead to type 2 diabetes (T2D). A hallmark of T2D is persistently elevated blood glucose levels, which can contribute to various complications, such as kidney failure and neuropathy. Given that abnormal gluconeogenic activity accounts for the primary hepatic glucose production (HGP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>), which is the main source of increased blood glucose concentration in T2D, targeting gluconeogenesis is a reasonable strategy to maintain blood glucose homeostasis.</p>
<p>Fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase (FBP1), a rate-controlling enzyme in gluconeogenesis, catalyzes the conversion of fructose 1,6-bisphosphate to fructose 6-phosphate. Interestingly, it has been reported that a point mutation in FBP1 can significantly reduce the efficacy of metformin, a first-line drug for the treatment of T2D, suggesting that FBP1 is a major contributor to the therapeutic effect of metformin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>). However, it remains unclear how FBP1 responds to metformin treatment.</p>
<p>Ten-Eleven Translocation 2 (TET2) belongs to the TET family, which includes TET1, TET2, and TET3. These enzymes function as DNA dioxygenases, catalyzing the successive oxidation of 5-methylcytosine (5mC) to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>), 5-formylcytosine (5fC), and 5-carboxycytosine (5caC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>). Finally, thymine-DNA glycosylase (TDG) mediates the removal of 5caC, leading to an unmodified cytosine, which participates in DNA demethylation and gene expression regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>). Recently, it was reported that the expression of FBP1 can be regulated by promoter methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>), leading us to hypothesize that TET2 may play a role in regulating FBP1 expression and gluconeogenesis.</p>
<p>Mutations in TET2 frequently occur in various myeloid cancers. Somatic alterations in TET2 are observed in 50% of patients with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia and are associated with poor outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>). The frequency of TET2 mutations in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes is 19% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>). Moreover, reversing TET2 deficiency facilitates hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) differentiation, blunts HSPC self-renewal, and blocks leukemia progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>). It has also been reported that TET2 represses mTORC1 and HIF1α signaling, thus suppressing tumor growth in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>). These studies focused on the function of TET2 in cancer development; however, it is unclear whether TET2 is involved in T2D progression. In this study, we demonstrated that TET2 is recruited by HNF4α to the FBP1 promoter and activates FBP1 expression by demethylation, contributing to gluconeogenesis and T2D pathology, and identified HNF4α-TET2-FBP1 axis as a target of metformin treatment, suggesting that targeting the HNF4α-TET2-FBP1 axis might be a potential strategy for T2D treatment.</p>

<title>TET2 contributes to gluconeogenesis and T2D</title>
<p>To explore the role of TET2 in gluconeogenesis, we developed three mouse models: one subjected to overnight fasting for 16 hours prior to tests, and two subjected to high-fat feeding (HFD) for 11 days and 12 weeks, respectively. The results showed that both fasting and HFD increased the mRNA and protein levels of TET2 in mouse livers compared to the normal chow group (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A-E</xref>), indicating that TET2 may play an important role in gluconeogenesis. To test this hypothesis, we examined the effect of TET2 on glucose output and found that TET2 overexpression promoted glucose output in HepG2 cells and primary mouse hepatocytes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A and B</xref>). Consistent with this, <italic>Tet2</italic> knockout (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>) impaired gluconeogenesis in HepG2 cells and mouse hepatocytes, even under glucagon treatment (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C and D</xref>). Together, these data demonstrated that TET2 contributes to gluconeogenesis, prompting us to investigate whether TET2 is involved in T2D progression. Pyruvate tolerance tests (PTT), glucose tolerance tests (GTT), and insulin tolerance tests (ITT) were conducted, and interestingly, the results showed that <italic>Tet2</italic> KO markedly increased glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity compared to the control mice (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E-G</xref>). In summary, the loss of <italic>Tet2</italic> function decreased gluconeogenesis in the liver and may contribute to the treatment of T2D.</p>

<title>TET2 upregulates FBP1 expression in liver cells</title>
<p>Next, we explored the potential mechanism by which TET2 increases gluconeogenesis. Fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase 1 (FBP1), a rate-limiting enzyme in gluconeogenesis, is crucial for its regulation and was recently identified as a target of metformin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>). This led us to hypothesize that FBP1 might participate in TET2-mediated regulation of gluconeogenesis. The results showed that glucagon significantly increased both TET2 and FBP1 expression levels in HepG2 and primary mouse liver cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A-C</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>Additionally, fasting and high-fat diet (HFD) also upregulated FBP1 mRNA levels in mouse livers (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D and E</xref>). Notably, Pearson correlation analysis revealed a positive correlation between TET2 and FBP1 expression in both control and fasting groups (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3F</xref>). To confirm this, Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis (GEPIA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>) was used to analyze the correlation between TET2 and FBP1 expression in human liver tissue. Consistent with the mouse data, FBP1 expression levels positively correlated with TET2 levels in human livers (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3G</xref>). These findings prompted us to examine whether TET2 regulates FBP1 expression. The results showed that TET2 overexpression promoted FBP1 expression in primary mouse hepatocytes and HepG2 cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3H</xref>), while <italic>Tet2</italic> KO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>) significantly decreased FBP1 levels in HepG2 and LO-2 cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3I and J</xref>). Furthermore, <italic>Tet2</italic> KO abolished the glucagon-induced upregulation of FBP1 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3K</xref>), suggesting that TET2 is required for glucagon-induced FBP1 upregulation. Taken together, these data indicate that TET2 regulates FBP1 in the livers.</p>
<p>To explore the mechanism by which TET2 regulates FBP1, ChIP-qPCR was performed to investigate whether TET2 could bind to the FBP1 promoter and catalyze the conversion of 5mC to 5hmC in HepG2 cells under glucagon treatment. We found that glucagon treatment promoted TET2 binding to the FBP1 promoter in HepG2 cells, which increased 5hmC levels and reduced 5mC levels (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3L-N</xref>). Importantly, <italic>Tet2</italic> KO blocked this process and caused the abnormal accumulation of 5mC in the FBP1 promoter (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3L-N</xref>). These data demonstrate that TET2 mediates the transcriptional activation of FBP1 in response to glucagon stimulation.</p>

<sec id="s2c">
<title>HNF4α is required for TET2 mediated transcriptional activation of FBP1</title>
<p>Given that TET2 binds to DNA without sequence specificity, we sought to understand how TET2 specifically activates FBP1 expression upon glucagon treatment. Recent genome-wide methylation and transcriptome analyses identified hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 alpha (HNF4α) as a master gluconeogenic transcription factor, playing a critical role in the pathogenesis of diabetic hyperglycemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>). More importantly, ChIP-seq data suggested that HNF4α binds to the FBP1 promoter and participates in the regulation of gluconeogenesis in adult mouse hepatocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>). To determine whether HNF4α is involved in TET2-mediated FBP1 expression, we performed immunofluorescence to examine the colocalization of TET2 and HNF4α with or without glucagon treatment in HepG2 cells. The results showed that the colocalization of TET2 and HNF4α significantly increased under glucagon treatment (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>). Consistently, we observed that glucagon increased the interaction between TET2 and HNF4α in HepG2 cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>). Furthermore, we knocked down HNF4α in HepG2 cells using siRNA (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>), which inhibited glucagon-induced TET2 binding to the FBP1 promoter (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref>), thereby suppressing TET2-mediated FBP1 expression (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E</xref>) and impairing glucose output under glucagon treatment (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4F</xref>). Notably, the expression of both HNF4α and FBP1 also increased in mouse livers under fasting or HFD treatment compared to the control group (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4G-I</xref>). In conclusion, these results support the notion that TET2-mediated gluconeogenesis is dependent on HNF4α.</p>

<title>HNF4α phosphorylation affects its binding to TET2 and FBP1 expression</title>
<p>Our results demonstrated that HNF4α recruits TET2 to the FBP1 promoter and activates FBP1 expression through demethylation, playing a crucial role in the regulation of hepatic glucose output. However, it remains unclear whether the HNF4α-TET2-FBP1 axis responds to metformin treatment. Metformin, a first-line antidiabetic drug widely used to treat hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes, is also a well-established adenosine 5’-monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>). Interestingly, one study revealed that AMPK phosphorylates HNF4α at Ser 313, reducing its transcriptional activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>). Combining these studies with our findings, we wonder whether metformin can affect the HNF4α-TET2-FBP1 axis. To explore the role of metformin-induced AMPK phosphorylation of HNF4α in FBP1 expression, we treated cells with metformin and assessed the interaction between HNF4α and TET2. The results showed that metformin administration impaired HNF4α’s ability to bind to TET2 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>), leading to a significant reduction in TET2 binding to the FBP1 promoter (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>). Consistently, metformin treatment significantly decreased the expression level of FBP1 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>). Notably, metformin also induced high levels of HNF4α phosphorylation at Ser 313 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>). To determine the effect of HNF4α phosphorylation on HNF4α-TET2-FBP1 axis, we transfected HepG2 cells with wild type HNF4α and Ser 313 mutants. The results showed that the phosphomimetic mutation (S313D) of HNF4α impaired its ability to bind to TET2 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D</xref>), prevented TET2 from binding to the FBP1 promoter (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5E</xref>), and reduced FBP1 expression at both mRNA and protein levels (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5F</xref>). In contrast, the phosphoresistant mutation (S313A) showed higher activity in interacting with TET2, recruiting TET2 to the FBP1 promoter, and activating its expression (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D-F</xref>). Taken together, these data demonstrate that metformin-mediated HNF4α phosphorylation suppresses FBP1 expression by preventing TET2 recruitment to the FBP1 promoter by HNF4α.</p>

<title>Targeting TET2 improves the efficacy of metformin in glucose metabolism <italic>in vivo</italic></title>
<p>Increased rates of gluconeogenesis, derived from continuously excessive hepatic glucose production (HGP), result in abnormal glucose homeostasis in type 2 diabetes (T2D). Fasting or high-fat diet (HFD)-induced T2D mice showed increased levels of TET2 and FBP1 in hepatocytes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A-E</xref>). However, it remains unclear whether knockdown of TET2, in combination with metformin, would decrease glucose production, thereby improving T2D treatment outcomes. HFD-induced diabetic mice were infused with AAV-scr or AAV-si<italic>Tet2</italic>. To confirm the efficiency of <italic>Tet2</italic> knockdown <italic>in vivo</italic>, <italic>Tet2</italic> mRNA levels in mouse livers were examined, revealing that TET2 expression significantly decreased upon AAV-si<italic>Tet2</italic> treatment (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>). Notably, fasting blood glucose and insulin levels were markedly lower in siTet2 group than the control group in response to metformin treatment (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B and C</xref>). PTT performed on HFD mice indicated that TET2 suppression sharply decreased hepatic gluconeogenesis (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6D</xref>), which was consistent with lower protein levels of FBP1 in mouse livers (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6E</xref>). Moreover, GTT and ITT showed that <italic>Tet2</italic> knockdown in HFD mice significantly enhanced glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity compared to AAV-scr-infused mice (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6F and G</xref>). Of note, the beneficial effects of <italic>Tet2</italic> knockdown alone were comparable to those of metformin in lowering glucose levels and improving insulin sensitivity from a therapeutic perspective. Interestingly, the combination of metformin and <italic>Tet2</italic> knockdown in HFD mice exhibited better glucose-lowering effects and insulin sensitivity than either <italic>Tet2</italic> knockdown or metformin alone. Collectively, these data demonstrated that suppressing TET2 synergizes with metformin to lower glucose production and enhance insulin sensitivity by inhibiting FBP1 expression.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our study revealed the function of TET2 in the regulation of gluconeogenesis. Notably, gluconeogenesis levels in <italic>Tet2</italic> knockout HepG2 cells and primary mouse hepatocytes significantly decreased even under glucagon treatment, demonstrating that TET2 is required for glucagon-induced upregulation of glucose output. Our findings link the novel function of TET2 to the gluconeogenic process. However, the role of TET2 in the pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes (T2D) remains unclear and requires further research. Additionally, the mechanisms by which TET2 is upregulated during gluconeogenesis deserve further exploration.</p>
<p>A recent study showed that metformin treatment can decrease liver glucose production by targeting FBP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>), suggesting that FBP1 may be a promising target for ameliorating diabetes. However, the regulation of FBP1 is poorly understood, although several studies have reported that the promoter methylation mediates FBP1 expression silencing in cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>). Here, we found that TET2 positively regulates FBP1 upon glucagon treatment, indicating that targeting TET2 may be a promising strategy for treating T2D.</p>
<p>We further explored how TET2 specifically regulates FBP1 expression in response to glucagon stimulation. Like most chromatin-modifying enzymes, which require DNA sequence-specific binding proteins, such as DNA transcription factors, to help them be recruited and regulate specific gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>), TET2 also requires binding partners to regulate particular pathways in a context-dependent manner. This is supported by findings that Wilms tumor protein (WT1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>) and Smad Nuclear Interacting Protein 1 (SNIP1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>) are indispensable for TET2 to suppress leukemia cell proliferation and regulate the cellular DNA damage response, respectively. Our data demonstrated that TET2 upregulates FBP1 and further increases gluconeogenesis in an HNF4α-dependent manner. Furthermore, metformin-induced HNF4α phosphorylation at Ser 313 impairs its binding ability to TET2 and reduces TET2 recruitment to the FBP1 promoter, leading to decreased FBP1 expression. More importantly, TET2-FBP1 inhibition has a synergistic effect with metformin in HFD mice.</p>
<p>Intriguingly, a clinical investigation study revealed that TET2 mutation occurred more frequently in the diabetes mellitus (DM) group than the non-DM, which suggested TET2 might be connected with insulin resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>). Additionally, inactivating mutations of epigenetic regulator TET2 led to metabolic dysfunction including clonal hematopoiesis, aggravate age- and obesity-related insulin resistance in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>). For the HNF4α variants, an analysis study using exome sequencing data showed that human genetic variations in HNF4α destroyed the protein structure and function, impaired insulin secretion and reduced sensitivity to insulin, and increased the risk of T2D in individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>). Furthermore, it was reported that a point mutation in FBP1 can reduce the efficacy of metformin treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>), providing a genetic evidence for the role of TET2-FBP1 axis in the therapeutic effect of metformin. In summary, our findings uncovered a previously unknown function of TET2 in gluconeogenesis. TET2, together with HNF4α, facilitates FBP1 expression by maintaining the hypomethylation of the FBP1 promoter, which leads to an increase in the gluconeogenic process. Thus, targeting the HNF4α-TET2-FBP1 axis may be a potential strategy to lower blood glucose in T2D.</p>

<sec id="s4a">
<title>Cell Culture and Transfection</title>
<p>HepG2, 293T, and primary mouse hepatocytes were cultured in DMEM medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and incubated at 37°C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. For transfection with Tet2 plasmids or siRNA, FuGENE HD (Roche) and Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) were utilized respectively. For lentivirus production, polyethyleneimine (PEI) from EZ Trans, Liji Shengwu, was the preferred agent. All transfection procedures were conducted according to the manufacturers’ instructions. The sequences of HNF4α siRNA were: 5’-AAUGUAGUCAUUGCCUAGGTT-3’ and 5’-UCUUGUCUUUGUCCACCACTT-3’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>).</p>

<title>Isolation of Primary Mouse Hepatocytes</title>
<p>Primary mouse hepatocytes were isolated by perfusing the liver with pre-warmed Hank’s Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS) at a flow rate of 5-7 mL/minute for 5 minutes after anesthetizing the mouse. Once the liver appeared pale, the perfusion solution was switched to a digestion buffer, maintained at the same flow rate and duration. The liver was then transferred to a 10 cm dish containing 10 mL of digestion medium. Hepatocytes were released by gently cutting and agitating the liver, after which 20 mL of cold PBS was added to halt the trypsin digestion. The cell suspension was filtered through a 70 μm nylon mesh (BD Falcon), centrifuged at 50g for 2 minutes, and the cell pellet was washed twice with cold PBS at 50g for 5 minutes each. The hepatocytes were then ready for subsequent experiments.</p>

<title>qPCR and ChIP-qPCR</title>
<p>Total RNA was extracted using an RNA purification kit (B0004D, EZBioscience). Real-time PCR was conducted using SYBR Green following cDNA synthesis. β-actin was used as an internal control. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays (Millipore, 17-408) were carried out per the manufacturer’s instructions. Chromatin was sheared by sonication at 4°C. Two micrograms of TET2 antibody (Millipore, MABE 462) were employed to immunoprecipitate chromatin fragments. The ChIP-enriched DNA was subsequently analyzed by qPCR. Primer sequences are provided in the supplementary data.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This study reveals a novel role of TET2 in regulating gluconeogenesis. It shows that fasting and a high-fat diet increase TET2 expression in mice, and TET2 knockout reduces glucose production. The findings highlight that TET2 positively regulates FBP1, a key enzyme in gluconeogenesis, by interacting with HNF4α to demethylate the FBP1 promoter in response to glucagon. Additionally, metformin reduces FBP1 expression by preventing TET2-HNF4α interaction. This identifies an HNF4α-TET2-FBP1 axis as a potential target for T2D treatment.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors use several methods in vivo (PTT, GTT, and ITT in fasted and HFD mice; and KO mice) and in vitro (in HepG2 and primary hepatocytes) to support the existence of the HNF4alpha-TET-2-FBP-1 axis in the control of gluconeogenesis. These findings uncovered a previously unknown function of TET2 in gluconeogenesis.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Although the authors provide evidence of an HNF4α-TET2-FBP1 axis in the control of gluconeogenesis, which contributes to the therapeutic effect of metformin on T2D, its role in the pathogenesis of T2D is less clear. The mechanisms by which TET2 is up-regulated by glucagon should be more explored.</p>

<p>We thank the reviewer for the positive evaluation and constructive comments. There is a factual error in the paragraph of “Strengths”. The comment that “The studies are very mechanistic, indicating that this interaction occurs via demethylation of HNF4a. Phosphorylation of HNF4a at ser 313 induced by metformin also controls the interaction between Tet2 and FBP1.” should be revised as follows: “The studies are very mechanistic, indicating that this interaction occurs via demethylation of FBP1. Phosphorylation of HNF4a at ser 313 induced by metformin also controls the interaction between Tet2 and HNF4a.”</p>
<p>Following reviewer’s suggestions, we will provide all the necessary information in methods section to inform the reader about how these experiments were performed, and improve the description of the results in the revised revision.</p>

<p>The authors use several methods in vivo (PTT, GTT, and ITT in fasted and HFD mice; and KO mice) and in vitro (in HepG2 and primary hepatocytes) to support the existence of the HNF4alpha-TET-2-FBP-1 axis in the control of gluconeogenesis. These findings uncovered a previously unknown function of TET2 in gluconeogenesis.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Although the authors provide evidence of an HNF4α-TET2-FBP1 axis in the control of gluconeogenesis, which contributes to the therapeutic effect of metformin on T2D, its role in the pathogenesis of T2D is less clear. The mechanisms by which TET2 is up-regulated by glucagon should be more explored.</p>

<p>We thank the reviewer for the supports and constructive comments, and agree with the reviewer that the current version mainly focused on the function of HNF4α-TET2-FBP1 axis in the control of gluconeogenesis. We will explore the pathogenesis of T2D and the mechanism how TET2 is up-regulated by glucagon in the revised revision.</p>
