<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Coordinated movements, speech, and other actions are impossible without precise timing. Computational models of interval timing are expected to provide key insights into the underlying mechanisms of timing, which are currently largely unknown. So far, existing models have only been partially replicating key experimental observations, such as the linear psychophysical law, the linear increase of the standard deviation (the scalar property or Weber’s law), and the modulation of subjective duration via dopamine. Here, we incorporate the state-dependent model for subsecond timing as proposed by Buonomano (2000) into a strongly data-driven computational network model of PFC We show that this model variant, the state-dependent PFC model, successfully encodes time up to 750 milliseconds and reproduces all key experimental observations mentioned above, including many of its details. Investigating the underlying mechanisms, we find that the representations of different intervals are based on the natural heterogeneity in the parameters of the network, leading to stereotypic responses of subsets of neurons. Furthermore, we propose a theory for the mechanism underlying subsecond timing in this model based on correlation and ablation analyses as well as mathematical analyses explaining the emergence of the scalar property and Vierordt law. The state-dependent PFC model proposed here constitutes the first data-driven model of subsecond timing in the range of hundreds of milliseconds that has been thoroughly tested against a variety of experimental data, providing an ideal starting point for further investigations of subsecond timing.</p></abstract>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The ability to estimate the passage of time is of fundamental importance for perceptual and cognitive processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>], such as speech, music, and decision-making [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>]. Impairments in time perception have been reported for various psychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia, Parkinson’s disease, Huntington’s disease, and major depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>]. In mammalian neural circuits, time perception spans ten orders of magnitudes including millisecond timing, interval timing and circadian rhythms comprising an entire day [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>]. Of these ranges, specifically, the neural basis and mechanisms of estimating interval durations between hundreds of milliseconds to minutes range, remain unclear [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>]. This ability, called interval timing, is involved in various processes such as foraging [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>], decision-making [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>], sequential motor performance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>], and associative conditioning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>]. Here, we focus on the subsecond range of interval timing, which is referred to as subsecond timing.</p>
<p>Despite the importance of telling time, the exact neural mechanisms of time perception and, in particular, for interval and subsecond timing, are not fully understood yet. Proposing and testing biologically plausible computational models is a promising way to gain an understanding of these mechanisms. A wide variety of interval timing models are currently discussed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>], including the state-dependent network model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>], models of ramping activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>], synfire chains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>], and the striatal beat model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>]. Despite this wealth of modeling approaches, none of them is universally accepted as a valid theory of time perception, partly due to a lack of thorough experimental verification. Furthermore, most of the existing models deliberately abstract from many biological details, which helps to emphasize the underlying mechanism but also calls their biological relevance into question.</p>
<p>Here, we investigate the state-dependent network model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>], in which the timing is not encoded by a dedicated tuning mechanism but by the intrinsic neuronal and synaptic properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>]. Specifically, Buonomano claims that the representation of time up to 400 ms is generated by time-dependent mechanisms within the network, such as short term plasticity (STP) and slow inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs) caused by metabotropic GABA receptor (GABA<sub>B</sub>) synapses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>]. More recent theoretical studies suggest that the hidden states of the network, induced, for example, by STP, allow encoding any stimulus together with its temporal context and time itself in neuronal activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>]. The model mimics the process of time interval estimation, where two stimuli are perceived that are set apart by a given interval and the task is to estimate the duration of that interval. The precision of such an estimate can be assessed using various measurement procedures, such as verbal estimation, reproduction, or discrimination (that is, comparison to a previously presented interval) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>]. While specific predictions of the state-dependent network model have been tested before [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>], a thorough examination using a range of established experimental results is still missing.</p>
<p>In this work, we test whether the state-dependent network model constitutes a plausible neural mechanism of subsecond timing in the brain. To this end, we first implemented the model into a data-driven spiking network model of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>] including substantial heterogeneities in the neuron and synapse parameters. Several studies provide evidence for the central role of the prefrontal cortex in time perception in rats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>], monkeys [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>], and humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>]. Biological constraints, and heterogeneity in particular, have previously been shown to pose a challenge to simple computational models, e.g. working memory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>]. Second, we tested whether the model could reproduce a range of established experimental findings of interval timing and can thus be validated by empirical data. Namely, we require the model to reproduce the linear psychophysical law, the scalar property, and the modulation of subjective duration by dopamine (dopamine (DA)).</p>
<p>The linear psychophysical law for the average duration estimates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>], and the scalar property for timing errors, also referred to as Weber’s law [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>] have been established as fundamental properties of time perception by psychophysical experiments. The linear psychophysical law states that real-time is proportional to the averaged representation of time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>]. The linear psychophysical law is widely accepted for time perception [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>]. However, the slope of the linear relation is often reported to be less than one, resulting in an overestimation of short intervals and an underestimation of long intervals, a phenomenon known as Vierordt’s law[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>]. The slope <italic>k</italic> and the indifference point indifference point (IP), i.e. the duration that is essentially represented, depend on the intervals considered [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>]. Studies employing intervals within the range of 200 ms-1000 ms show the IP to be between 600 ms-800 ms with the slope of <italic>k</italic> ≈ 0.5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>], whereas testing intervals within the range of 400 ms-2000 ms, shifts the IP to higher values IP≈ 1400 ms with a timing slope of <italic>k</italic> ≈ 0.9 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>]. Another study from [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>] found a slope of <italic>k</italic>≈ 0.7 for visual stimuli and <italic>k</italic> ≈ 1.1 for auditory stimuli for short intervals (400 ms-600 ms) and a slope of around <italic>k</italic> ≈ 0.6 for longer intervals (2000 ms-3000 ms). Although some studies suggest that IP can be calculated by the arithmetic mean of the applied intervals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>], other studies do not support this hypothesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>].</p>
<p>The scalar property or Weber law refers to the observation that the timing error, i.e., the standard deviation of the duration estimates <italic>σ</italic>, increases linearly with the duration of the interval. To quantify this relation, the Weber fraction can be used, dividing the standard deviation of the duration estimate by its mean. A constant Weber fraction over a range of durations is an indicator of Weber’s law. Although observed in numerous studies, the scalar property is not universal but seems to hold for intervals of around 200 ms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>] up to 2000 ms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>] in humans, with typical Weber fractions of around 0.05 0.13 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>]. For shorter intervals, the Weber fraction increases, indicating a sublinear (e.g., square root) scaling of timing errors, while for longer intervals, a superlinear increase in timing errors and an increase in Weber fraction is reported in different species (pigeons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>], rats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>] and humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>]). Using information-theoretical methods, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>] suggest that these different scaling regimes of timing errors may indicate different mechanisms underlying time perception. In particular, the scalar property is explained by so-called variance-based timing in this framework, i.e., using the temporal information contained in the timing errors itself, which increase over time, and thus can be used to decode time by means of a pure diffusion process.</p>
<p>While the linear psychophysical law and the scalar property constitute static properties of time perception, several factors such as emotions and mood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>], attention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>] and stimulus properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>] have been described to modulate time perception. A prominent pharmacological modulator of time perception is dopamine (DA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref>]. Specifically, studies suggest that of the two main types of DA receptors, D1 and D2, the latter has a high potential to modify time perception [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref>]. Numerous studies report that decreasing dopaminergic activity, e.g., by dopaminergic antagonists, can slow down the internal clock leading to an underestimation of timing intervals, while increasing levels of DA, e.g., by dopaminergic agonists, speeds up the internal clock [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref>]. Although most of these studies have been conducted for intervals in the seconds to minutes range [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref>], similar effects have also been found for shorter intervals, investigating, for example, dopaminergic drugs in healthy humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref>] and mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref>] and dopamine-related conditions such as ADHD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref>].</p>
<p>We find that the state-dependent network model reproduces all three experimental findings outlined above within a limited range of interval durations when implemented within the PFC network model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>]. Analyzing the underlying mechanisms, we further found that the network can be dissected into neuron pools, each of which represents a specific interval. In particular, a subset of neurons within a pool respond maximally to a specific stimulus representative of a time interval. As confirmed by ablation of the model components, this duration-specific response is mainly driven by STP and GABA<sub>B</sub>. Furthermore, limitations for longer interval durations and higher Poisson noise are examined to test the robustness of the model. Finally, we propose a theoretical account for the generation of subsecond timing following Weber’s law within this model that also hints at possible generalizations beyond the particular model presented here and links violations of Weber’s law with the occurrence of Vierordt’s law. This study can be seen as an experimental validation of the state-dependent network model. To the best of our knowledge, this model is the first that has been tested against such a wide range of experimental results.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>In order to test its timing properties in a more realistic setting, we incorporated the state-dependent model proposed by Buonomano [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>] into a biologically detailed PFC model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>] (see Methods for details). Briefly, the model consists of 1000 simplified adaptive exponential (simpAdEx) integrateand-fire neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">73</xref>], which are subdivided into superficial (L2/3) and deep (L5) cortical layers and into pyramidal neurons and various types of interneurons. Neurons are randomly connected by conductance-based double exponential functions of the types AMPA, NMDA, and GABA<sub>A</sub> equipped with three types of dynamics STP, namely facilitation, depression, and a combined version of both [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">74</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">75</xref>]. All parameters were randomly drawn from experimentally validated distributions, and synaptic connectivity was based on pairwise connection probabilities from the literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>]. Neurons are driven by a constant background current (<italic>I</italic><sub>back</sub>) that differs between pyramidal cells and interneurons. To implement the state-dependent model, a slow GABA<sub>B</sub> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">76</xref>] current was included into the PFC network model, compensated by increasing <italic>I</italic><sub>back</sub> by a factor of 1.4. A comparison of the spike statistics with and without GABA<sub>B</sub> can be found in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figA1">Suppl. Fig. A.1</xref>. Except for a decreased coefficient of variation (CV), the statistics did not change by adding GABA<sub>B</sub> to the model.</p>
<p>Layer 2/3</p>
<p>All neurons were stimulated at the beginning and end of an interval with a short step current (<italic>I</italic><sub><italic>s</italic></sub> = 220 pA, duration 10 ms), cf. <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>. The first stimulus was applied to the network at 1500 ms to ensure that the network has reached steady state. For convenience, the starting point of the first stimulus will be defined as <italic>t</italic><sub>0</sub> = 0 ms. After simulation, the number of spikes of each neuron within a time window (∆<italic>t</italic><sub><italic>w</italic></sub> = 25 ms) that ends at <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="474629v4_inline1.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> after the second stimulation (see <xref rid="fig16" ref-type="fig">Fig. 16A</xref> in the Methods section), were extracted. These numbers of spikes are referred to as states and are assumed to contain information about the interval duration between the two stimuli. Raster plots of all neurons for exemplary inter-stimulus intervals are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figA2">Suppl. Fig. A.2</xref>.</p>

<p>The PFC network (center gray box) with layer 2/3 and layer 5 neurons (excitatory: blue, inhibitory: red, connectivities: gray arrows) is stimulated in the beginning and the end of several inter-stimulus intervals (color-coded from 50 ms to 750 ms). Spike trains are extracted within a window around the second stimulus to compute network states and to train weights of the readout layer via least squares to predict the estimated inter-stimulus intervals ∆<italic>t</italic><sub>test</sub>.</p></caption>
<graphic xlink:href="474629v4_fig1.tif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/>
</fig>
<p>To predict interval durations ∆<italic>t</italic><sub>test</sub>, a readout layer was added to the model with the number of output units <italic>N</italic><sub><italic>r</italic></sub> matching the number of interval durations presented during training, cf. color-coded readout units in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>. Each output unit is then trained with the least squares method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">77</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">78</xref>] (see Methods for details) to be active for the respective time interval and to be inactive for all other time intervals. We emphasize that this training is not intended to mimic learning processes in the brain. Rather, the readout layer is used as an ideal observer that extracts as much temporal information out of the state-dependent network as possible, as in the original publication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>]. We trained the weights of the readout units with various inter-stimulus intervals (∆<italic>t</italic><sub>train</sub> = 50 - 750 ms) in 50 ms steps and tested in 25 ms steps. Normalized outputs of trained readout units for different test intervals ∆<italic>t</italic><sub>test</sub> are shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>. Each readout unit has a bell-shaped tuning curve peaking at its respective interval and being nonzero at neighboring time points, allowing the model to generalize to intervals it has not seen during training. For intervals longer than 300 ms, the tuning curves become broader.</p>

<title>Testing the linear psychophysical law and the scalar property</title>
<p>To test the linearity of the psychophysical law, we calculated the average subjective time by multiplying the output values of the readout units by their corresponding ∆<italic>t</italic><sub>test</sub> and adding all readout units. The estimated time is well described by a straight line (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A</xref>), with an overestimation of shorter intervals and an underestimation of longer intervals, in agreement with Vierordt’s law. A linear fit yields slopes <italic>a</italic> = 0.8 ±0.1 and offsets <italic>b</italic> = 69.9 ±16.0. The slopes <italic>a</italic> are within the range of experimental observations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>] and IP of the averaged estimated times can be found at IP = 530 ms, also in line with experimental studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>].</p>
<p>To test the scalar property or Weber’s law, we computed the standard deviations of the estimated time over 50 trials, as shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>, which is fitted with a linear function (in red) and for comparison with a square root function (in blue). We also computed the trial-averaged Weber fraction, restricted to the range of 400 - 750 ms (green line in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>) to control for the fact that constant errors (the offset of the line) dominate at shorter intervals, causing the Weber fraction to decrease (generalized Weber’s law [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>]). The Weber fraction of 0.059 matches the experimental observations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">79</xref>]. Computing the readout weights with a ridge regression instead of linear least squares yields almost identical results, cf. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figA3">Suppl. Fig. A.3</xref>.</p>
<p>Both properties, the linear psychophysical law and the scalar property, were further tested by averaging over several sets of neuronal and synaptic parameters, each of which is randomly drawn from experimentally validated distributions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>]. For ten parameter sets, the psychophysical law is wellfitted by a linear function and a slope of 0.85 ±0.05, which is significantly smaller than 1.0 (one sample t-test: <italic>t</italic> (499) = − 74.8, <italic>p &lt;</italic> 0.001). The IP of the averaged estimated time is 545.5 ±23.3 ms.</p>
<p>Regarding the scalar property, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref> suggests that it is not trivial to determine whether the standard deviation follows a linear or a square root function, i.e., whether the scalar property holds true. To answer this question, we averaged the standard deviations over simulations for the same ten parameter sets, but with a larger number of ∆<italic>t</italic><sub>test</sub> (10 instead of 25 ms steps, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). Up to interval durations of 500 ms, the data are well approximated by a linear function. However, at longer ∆<italic>t</italic><sub>test</sub>, the standard deviations saturate to a constant value. Overall, the data can be approximated by a piecewise linear function of the form</p>

<title>Dopaminergic modulation</title>
<p>To examine the third result, the modulation of subjective duration by the D2 dopamine receptor, we simulated a transient change in the activation of the D2 receptor by changing the neuronal and synaptic parameters by the values summarized in <xref rid="tbl5" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>, which reflect the experimentally observed effects of D2 <italic>in vitro</italic> (see Methods for details). These changes were only applied for the test phase, while for training, the same parameters were used as before. The changes in <xref rid="tbl5" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref> were considered to be activation of 100 % D2 (D2 agonist), while the original parameters reflected activation of 0 %. Inverting the sign of all changes in <xref rid="tbl5" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref> simulated − 100 % deactivation of D2 (D2 antagonist), so 0 % represented a baseline activation level that can be increased or decreased.</p>

<p>Within this limited range of durations and modulation levels, subjective time shortens for higher antagonistic modulations (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>, from darker to brighter red colors) and lengthens for agonistic modulation (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>, from darker to brighter blue colors), consistent with experimental results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref>]. In <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref> (black curve), we show the slope of a linear fit to the psychophysical law for each level of D2 modulation. The slopes reach a maximum around 20 % (one-way ANOVA over 50 trials, <italic>F</italic>(10, 539) = 299.3, <italic>p &lt;</italic> 0.001) and drop again for higher values. To further assess the mechanism of subjective time modulation of D2, we restricted modulation to synaptic parameters (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>, magenta curve) and neuronal parameters (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>, green curve). For synaptic modulation, the slopes basically follow the same curve as with both modulations together, whereas the neuronal modulation alone shows only an effect at strong agonistic modulation, where it further decreases the slope.</p>
<p>To assess a potential dopaminergic modulation of timing errors (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>), we also fitted a linear function to the standard deviations within the range of modulations where subjective duration linearly increases (− 50 % to 20 %), but observed systematic changes neither in the slope (linear regression: slope = −0.03, <italic>p</italic> = 0.20, <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.26) nor in the intercept (linear regression: slope = 9.62, <italic>p</italic> = 0.16, <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.30) of Weber’s law. The standard deviations and the slopes over the full range of durations and modulations are shown in Suppl. Fig. A.6.</p>
<p>So far, we have simulated acute D2 modulation in the test trials, while leaving the training trials unaffected by dopamine. If we retrain the readout weights under the influence of D2 modulation, we can counteract the changing speed of the internal clock, as we tested on − 30 % agonistic and antagonistic modulation. <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> shows the psychophysical law and Weber’s law for agonistic dopaminergic modulation of 30 % (red) for the antagonistic dopaminergic modulation of −30 % (blue), both of which are almost identical to the unmodulated simulation from <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref> (black).</p>

<title>Limitations of the model</title>
<p>To identify potential limitations of the model, we considered longer intervals and higher noise levels. When we trained the readout network for longer interval durations up to 2000 ms and tested within the same range, we found that the time perception was less accurate. In particular, the slope of the psychophysical law is much smaller compared to the shorter range, implying a more pronounced Vierordt’s law (slope = 0.7 ±0.1) with the IP shifted towards longer intervals (IP = 852.9 ±186.3 ms), cf. <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>.

<p>Regarding the effect of noise levels, we originally connected <italic>N</italic><sub>Poisson</sub> = 10 Poisson neurons with a firing rate of 1 Hz to the network.

To investigate whether subsecond timing still works in this case, we increased the firing rates of the 10 Poisson neurons to <italic>f</italic> =1000 Hz and compared interval timing at different noise levels by increasing the Poisson neuron weights <italic>w</italic><sub>Poisson</sub> and simultaneously decreasing the background current to avoid overexcitation and keep the standard deviation of the subthreshold membrane potential (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figA7">Suppl.

<title>Mechanisms of subsecond timing</title>
<p>Given that interval timing, especially Weber’s law, works within the statedependent PFC model at least for limited noise levels and intervals up to 750 ms, we next aimed to understand the underlying mechanisms of timing within this model. First, we performed ablation analyses, i.e., systematically disabled specific components of the network to determine which of them are critical for which aspect of timing in the model. Second, we performed correlation studies to determine whether there are pools of neurons that encode specific intervals and, if so, how they differ from neurons that are predictive of other intervals. Finally, we studied a simplified model to explain the origin of the scalar property and Vierordt’s law.</p>

<sec id="s2e">
<title>Ablation analyses</title>
<p>In this section, we systematically remove some of the components of the model to analyze which are critical for our results. We focus on three main ingredients: synaptic processes with long time constants, heterogeneity of neuronal and synaptic parameters, and irregular background activity (induced by constant background currents).</p>
<p>Regarding synaptic dynamics, there are three elements with long time constants that might influence the estimation of time: NMDA currents, GABA<sub>B</sub> currents, and STP of each of the synaptic currents. To test their specific influence on time estimation, we conducted ablation analyses by removing each of these synaptic processes, adjusting the background current and synaptic weights to compensate for missing input, and retraining the readout layer. The exact adjustments can be found in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tblA1">Suppl. Table A.1</xref>. The parameters of Vierordt’s law (slope and IP) are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tblA3">Suppl. Table A.3</xref>, while the fit parameters for the piecewise linear fit for Weber’s law are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tblA4">Suppl. Table A.4</xref>.</p>
<p>Removing NMDA synapses had no effect on estimated times, see <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">D</xref> in magenta, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tblA3">Suppl. Table A.3</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tblA4">Suppl. Table A.4</xref>. In contrast, when removing STP, time estimation gets worse reflected in a much more pronounced Vierordt’s law and increased standard deviation compared to the original state-dependent PFC model, see <xref ref-type="table" rid="tblA3">Suppl. Table A.3</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tblA4">Suppl. Table A.4</xref> and <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7A,D</xref> in red. This effect is even more pronounced when GABA<sub>B</sub> is removed, such that inhibition is limited to GABA<sub>A</sub> with much faster time constants, see <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7A,D</xref> in blue. To test the combined effect of GABA<sub>B</sub>, STP and NMDA, we removed all three of them in a further simulation, which yielded a slope of 0.35±0.04 for time estimation and an even higher standard deviation and decreased slope <italic>a</italic> compared to ablating GABA<sub>B</sub> alone, see <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7A,D</xref> in cyan.</p>

<p>In the next step, we tested the role of heterogeneity in neuron and synapse parameters. In the original simulations, these parameters are randomly drawn from distributions that are specific for each neuron and synapse type [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>]. Here, we used homogeneous parameters within each neuron type. To this end, we first removed the heterogeneity within each neuron type for the neuronal parameters, second, for the synaptic parameters connecting each pair of neuron types, and finally, for both parameter sets. For all three ablations, we observed similar slopes of the linear psychophysical law and a slightly shifted IP only for homogeneous neuronal and synaptic parameters, see <xref ref-type="table" rid="tblA3">Suppl. Table A.3</xref>. We then further reduced heterogeneity by using only one single type of STP for each pair of neuron types (see Methods for details). This manipulation resulted in a much more pronounced Vierordt’s law with a slope of around 0.53 ±0.08 and a reduced IP as well as higher standard deviations with larger offset <italic>b</italic>, see the cyan line in <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">E</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tblA3">Suppl. Table A.3</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tblA4">Suppl. Table A.4</xref>. Finally, using homogeneous synaptic delays (which are also randomly drawn in the original simulations) for all synapses does not affect timing, see green line in <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">E</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tblA3">Suppl. Table A.3</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tblA4">Suppl. Table A.4</xref>.</p>
<p>In order to determine whether the background activation of neurons in between two subsequent stimulations might be responsible for the linear timing results, we removed the background current to all neurons, such that no pronounced activity could be seen between intervals. Removing the background current only impaired timing accuracy up to 200 ms (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tblA3">Suppl. Table A.3</xref> and <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7C</xref>) and disrupted Weber’s law to a negative slope near zero (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tblA4">Suppl. Table A.4</xref> and <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7F</xref>). Furthermore, we showed in the previous section that increasing noise levels up to 1000 Hz yielded larger timing errors and gradually shifted the cut-off value <italic>c</italic> of the piecewise linear fit of the scalar property towards shorter intervals (see <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">D</xref>).</p>

<title>Interval-encoding pools</title>
<p>To understand the key features of interval discrimination within training, we classified each neuron in the network as encoding a specific interval according to the readout neuron with the highest readout weights, following the procedure in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>]. All neurons encoding the same interval form a so-called interval-encoding pools (IEPs). Only neurons with positive readout weights of above 0.01 are considered in the following. In this way, we find intervalencoding pools (pool size:<italic>μ</italic> = 14.3, <italic>σ</italic> = 4.6, min = 4, max = 23), of which 571 out of 1000 neurons were not assigned to an interval-encoding pool, as the highest readout weights are too small. After assigning neurons to pools, the pools were sorted from shorter to longer intervals (see <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8A</xref>). Within each interval-encoding pool, the neurons were additionally sorted from low to high weights.</p>

<p>Calculating the normalized average weight distribution from the neurons in each group to their respective readout neuron, we see stereotypic weight profiles which we term <italic>temporal receptive fields</italic>: Weights peak shortly before the time that the respective pool represents and suppress contributions from both earlier and later pools asymmetric (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8B</xref>). Furthermore, we compared the states of neurons in each pool in response to the second stimulus and also found a stereotypic firing rate profile for most pools: the normalized firing rate increases until 100 % of the elapsed time for the respective pool is reached and saturates for all longer intervals, see <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8C</xref>. Taken together, these results indicate that each pool translates the time elapsed relative to the interval it represents into a similar firing rate code and also transfers this code to its respective readout neuron using a stereotypic weight profile.</p>

<p>To determine the role of neuronal excitability in encoding different intervals, we calculated the average rheobase for each group (minimal current to make each neuron fire, <xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Fig. 10A</xref>, see Methods for details) and subtracted this value from the average total synaptic current within the range <italic>t</italic> = − 500 ms to <italic>t</italic> = − 5 ms for each neuron, cf. the black line in <xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9C</xref>. While the rheobase (slope = 0.02, <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.13, <italic>p</italic> = 0.2) does not differ between pools, both the total synaptic current (<xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> before stimulation, total) and the mean (neuron-wise) difference between rheobase and total synaptic current, see Fig. see <xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Fig. 10B</xref> significantly differ over the whole interval range between 50 and 750 ms (linear regression: slope = 0.07 and <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.8, <italic>p &lt;</italic> 0.01).</p>

<p>Finally, we examine whether differences in synaptic currents between pools are determined by differences in neuronal and synaptic parameters (<xref rid="fig11" ref-type="fig">Fig. 11</xref>). Indeed, the summed synaptic weights onto all neurons within each IEPs (<xref rid="fig11" ref-type="fig">Fig. 11A</xref>) and the number of synaptic inputs onto each pool (11B) increase in pools encoding longer intervals, for both inhibitory and excitatory synaptic connections as well as the sum of the two. We also found an increase in the averaged synaptic delays for higher intervals for excitatory and both synapses (<xref rid="fig11" ref-type="fig">Fig. 11C</xref>) and an increase in the averaged membrane time constants <italic>τ</italic><sub><italic>mem</italic></sub> across pools for intervals up to 400 ms (linear regression: slope = 0.03, <italic>p</italic> = 0.008, <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.72)(<xref rid="fig11" ref-type="fig">Fig. 11F</xref>).

<title>Origin of the scalar property</title>
<p>Here, we discuss how the scalar property of the timing errors may arise in the state-dependent model.

<p>As summarized in <xref rid="fig12" ref-type="fig">Fig. 12A</xref>, durations are estimated in the model using the state-dependent network, divided into <italic>N</italic> IEPs, and the same number of output neurons, each of which encoding an interval duration <italic>T</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>. The activity levels of the output neurons <italic>O</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>(<italic>t</italic>) are multiplied by the respective duration <italic>T</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> and summed to form the duration estimate <italic>T</italic><sub>est</sub>(<italic>t</italic>). Furthermore, the outputs <italic>O</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>(<italic>t</italic>) arise from the firing rate states FR<sub><italic>i</italic></sub>(<italic>t</italic>) of each interval-encoding pool of the network, multiplied by the output weights <italic>w</italic><sub><italic>ij</italic></sub>. Thus,
<disp-formula id="eqn2">
<graphic xlink:href="474629v4_eqn2.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
To highlight the main features of the model that give rise to the scalar property, we first restrict ourselves to estimate durations that are identical to the ones that are encoded in a single interval-encoding pool (<italic>t</italic> = <italic>T</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>) and reduce the model to contain only the one output neuron associated with this interval-encoding pool. Under these assumptions, <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn2">Eq. 2</xref> reduces to
<disp-formula id="eqn3">
<graphic xlink:href="474629v4_eqn3.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
The scalar property requires that <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="474629v4_inline2.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>, where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="474629v4_inline3.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> and <italic>&lt; T</italic><sub>est</sub> <italic>&gt;</italic> (<italic>T</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>) are the mean and standard deviation of <italic>T</italic><sub>est</sub> at time <italic>T</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>, respectively. As <italic>T</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> and <italic>w</italic><sub><italic>ii</italic></sub> are constant, it follows <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="474629v4_inline4.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="474629v4_inline5.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>. Two features of the model allow us to directly relate these two moments: First, as seen in <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8C</xref>, the firing rate curves FR<sub><italic>i</italic></sub>(<italic>t</italic>) follow a stereotypic and time-invariant shape for all IEPs <italic>i</italic>. Thus, one can write FR<sub><italic>i</italic></sub>(<italic>t</italic>) = FR(<italic>t/T</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>). In particular, for <italic>t</italic> = <italic>T</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>, the firing rates are FR<sub><italic>i</italic></sub>(<italic>T</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>) = FR(<italic>T</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub><italic>/T</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>) = FR(1), which is constant across pools. Second, note that each pool consists of <italic>N</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> neurons, each with firing probability <italic>p</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>(<italic>t</italic>) at a given time <italic>t</italic>. If each neuron is assumed to fire not more than one spike in response to the second stimulus (which is true for the vast majority of neurons within all IEPs), the firing rate (i.e., the number of firing neurons) follows the binomial distribution (<xref rid="fig12" ref-type="fig">Fig. 12H</xref>). This distribution describes the number of successes (here: spikes) in a sequence of <italic>N</italic> random experiments (here: neurons), where each success has the same probability <italic>p</italic>. The mean firing rate <italic>&lt; FR</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> <italic>&gt;</italic>= <italic>N</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub><italic>p</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> of the pool <italic>i</italic> and its standard deviation <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="474629v4_inline6.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> are known from this distribution. Using the first relation, the mean firing rate at time <italic>T</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> in pool <italic>i</italic> can be expressed as FR<sub><italic>i</italic></sub>(<italic>T</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>) = FR(1) = <italic>N</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub><italic>p</italic>∗, where <italic>p</italic>∗ is the (constant) peak firing probability of all pools at the time <italic>T</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> that pool represents.</p>
<p>From the above considerations, and by setting the weight <italic>w</italic><sub><italic>ii</italic></sub> to 1/(<italic>N</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub><italic>p</italic>∗), such that <italic>&lt; T</italic><sub>est</sub> <italic>&gt;</italic> (<italic>T</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>) = <italic>T</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>, it follows that
<disp-formula id="eqn4">
<graphic xlink:href="474629v4_eqn4.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
which is the statement of the scalar property. The proportionality constant, the Weber fraction, can be approximated by <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="474629v4_inline7.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> for <italic>p</italic> close to one.</p>
<p>To verify that the binomial distribution provides a good approximation to our data, <xref rid="fig13" ref-type="fig">Fig. 13</xref> shows the relation between the mean and standard deviation of the firing probabilities <italic>p</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> of each pool. The dotted curve represents the relation predicted by the binomial distribution. The probability <italic>p</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> is estimated by normalizing the mean firing rates <italic>FR</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> to the maximal value in each pool. The standard deviation is fitted to the relation from the binomial distribution, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="474629v4_inline8.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> and the values in the figure are divided by the fit parameter <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="474629v4_inline9.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>. The fit is best for pools representing short in-tervals. For intervals above 400 ms, the firing probability <italic>p</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> decreases and thus, the standard deviation increases. The estimated <italic>N</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> values from the fit match the actual pool sizes well (estimate from the fit to the binomial distribution: 16 ± 5, average actual pool size: 14 ± 5) with no statistical difference (two-sample t-test: <italic>t</italic> (28) = 0.936, <italic>p</italic> = 0.36).</p>

</fig>
<p>In the supplementary materials, see SAppendix B, we illustrate how the above computations can be generalized to arbitrary durations <italic>t</italic> and the full range of neurons. Importantly, this generalization requires that the shape of the output tuning curves <italic>O</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>(<italic>t</italic>) are largely conserved across output neurons <italic>i</italic>. In the following section, we discuss consequences of violating this assumption, which apparently occurs at longer durations (cf. <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). Finally, we discuss how the stereotypic firing rate profiles (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8C</xref>) for the different IEPs of the network may arise.</p>
<p>The profiles approximate the cumulative normal distribution, which follows from the fact that each neuron fires as soon as its particular firing threshold is crossed, which is governed by a stochastic process: Given that the membrane potential of each neuron is driven by noise that can be approximated by a normal distribution, the probability to cross the threshold at a given time is the cumulative normal distribution with the difference of the mean membrane potential <italic>&lt; V</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>(<italic>t</italic>) <italic>&gt;</italic> from the threshold <italic>V</italic><sub>th,<italic>i</italic></sub> as the mean. Note that this difference is decreased by the second stimulus, and we assume that the inputs are balanced such that the membrane potential is well below the threshold without the second stimulus, but close to the threshold in the presence of the second stimulus. In the following, we only consider the membrane potential under the influence of the second stimulus and assess under which conditions it may cross the threshold.</p>
<p>The standard deviation of the membrane potential does not systematically change over time, as neurons are driven back toward their resting potential by leak currents, which can be described by the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">82</xref>] for which the standard deviation is constant in time. Thus, the change in <italic>p</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>(<italic>t</italic>) over time is mainly driven by changes in the mean membrane potential <italic>&lt; V</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>(<italic>t</italic>) <italic>&gt;</italic>. The main driver of this change over time is the slow GABA<sub>B</sub> inhibition after the first stimulus, which effectively prevents neurons from firing in response to a second stimulus within a certain window of time. Apart from the time constant of the GABA<sub>B</sub> conductance, this time window is determined by the neuronal and synaptic parameters within each pool. As we have seen in <xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Fig. 10</xref>, the mean current difference to the neurons’ rheobase increases for pools encoding longer intervals (which can be translated into the difference between the average membrane potential and the firing threshold). Thus, more of the inhibition from the first stimulus must be worn off before those pools can respond to the second stimulus, which happens at later times. In summary, the increase of <italic>p</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> over time is mainly due to a gradual decay of long-term inhibition which decreases the difference between average membrane potential and firing threshold and thus, increases the chance of each neuron to fire. The different parameters in each pool determine the speed by which <italic>p</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> increases over time.</p>
<p>To verify that the observed scaling of <italic>p</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> can be reproduced by the mechanism described above, we have constructed a minimal model simulating a single neuron that receives a large amount of random, balanced excitatory and inhibitory currents and is subject to a GABA<sub>B</sub> current following the time of the first stimulus and to a fixed depolarization at the time of the second stimulus (see Methods for details). Simulating this neuron for a large number of trials allows estimating <italic>p</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> for a given firing threshold <italic>V</italic><sub>th,<italic>i</italic></sub>. For simplicity, we simulate the different pools by varying <italic>V</italic><sub>th,<italic>i</italic></sub>, although the above results suggest a variation of the synaptic properties. For each simulated pool <italic>i</italic>, we compute the first time <italic>T</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> at with <italic>p</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> exceeds 95 % and record <italic>T</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> as the represented duration of this pool. When time is scaled by this duration, <italic>p</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>(<italic>t/T</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>) shows the same cumulative normal distribution time course for each pool (<xref rid="fig14" ref-type="fig">Fig. 14</xref>), as we see in the network model (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8D</xref>).</p>

<title>Deviations from the scalar property and the origin on Vierordt’s law</title>
<p>As mentioned in the previous section, the scalar property relies on the assumption that the output tuning curves have the same shape for all output neurons. From <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>, it is apparent that this assumption is violated for output neurons representing intervals that are longer than 350 ms, where the tuning curves quickly grow broader as the interval durations increase. The widths of these tuning curves reflect the standard deviation of the underlying firing rate curves. Indeed, <xref rid="fig13" ref-type="fig">Fig. 13</xref> shows that for longer intervals, higher standard deviations of the firing rates occur as the mean firing rates decrease and thus, the standard deviations move towards the middle of the half-circle implied by the binomial distribution. Here, we discuss the consequences of violating the assumption of stereotypic tuning curves of the output neurons.</p>
<p>If we consider the most extreme case where all curves <italic>O</italic><sub><italic>j</italic></sub> are completely flat such that all intervals contribute to the estimate with the same weight, it follows from the normalization of <italic>O</italic><sub><italic>j</italic></sub>(<italic>t</italic>) to one that for each time <italic>t</italic><sup>∗</sup>, the same duration estimate <italic>&lt; T</italic><sub>est</sub> <italic>&gt;</italic> is generated independently of the real time <italic>t</italic><sup>∗</sup>, which is the average over all represented intervals <italic>T</italic><sub><italic>j</italic></sub>. As the standard deviations are linked to the mean duration estimate, the standard deviations are also constant in time in this case. In intermediate cases, combining constant, sharp tuning curves <italic>O</italic><sub><italic>j</italic></sub> for short intervals <italic>T</italic><sub><italic>j</italic></sub> and increasingly broader curves for longer intervals, the scaling of both the mean and standard deviation are shifted away from the linear relations described in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqnB1">Eq. B.1</xref> and <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqnB4">B.4</xref> towards constant values. This implies that deviations from the scalar property and Vierordt’s law, the observation that long intervals are underestimated and short ones are overestimated, are mechanistically linked. Indeed, for most manipulations described above, a strong negative linear relation is found between the slope of Vierordt’s law and the minimal standard deviation of the output curves <italic>O</italic><sub><italic>j</italic></sub>, see <xref rid="fig15" ref-type="fig">Fig. 15</xref> (<italic>r</italic> = −0.96, <italic>t</italic>(12) = −11.88, <italic>p &lt;</italic> 0.01).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We investigated whether the established state-dependent network model of subsecond timing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>] still works when embedded in a data-driven network model of the prefrontal cortex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>] and whether it is capable of reproducing some of the most important experimental results on time perception, namely the linear psychophysical law [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>], the scalar property or Webers law [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>] and the modulation of subjective duration by DA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>]. This investigation can be seen as an experimental validation of the model, which has not been conducted so far for any theory of time perception. Indeed, we showed that the model can successfully reproduce the linear psychophysical law and the Webers law for intervals in the range of 50 - 750 ms. Modulation of D2 DA receptor was tested by modifying neuronal and synaptic parameters and yielded, within a smaller range of 200 - 600 ms, a slowing of the internal clock for an antagonistic modulation (up to − 50 %) and, conversely, a speeding of the internal clock for an agonistic modulation (up to 20 %). As we discuss below in more detail, similar limitations are also observed in experiments. Overall, the model can be seen as validated by all of the chosen comparisons with experimental data. While those findings are among the most established in the literature on duration estimates, it would be desirable to test the model against further experimental evidence to further strengthen its position as a plausible mechanism for time perception in the brain.</p>
<p>In the following, we discuss the dynamic mechanism underlying subsecond timing in the state-dependent model, as well as the implications of the present work for explaining the three above-mentioned experimental results. Finally, we compare the current model to the original state-dependent network model by Buonomano [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>].</p>

<title>Mechanism and limitations of subsecond timing within the state-dependent PFC model</title>
<p>We found that different interval durations are encoded in specific populations of neurons (interval-encoding pools, IEPs) that were identified by the readout neuron onto which each neuron projects with the largest readout weight. Each duration-specific neuron pool shows a stereotypic firing rate response to the second stimulus that gradually increases as the interval becomes longer, up to a maximum just before the interval duration the pool encoded. These curves are reminiscent of the psychometric response curves that are seen in many time perception paradigms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">83</xref>]. Importantly, the curves show very similar profiles when the time elapsed is scaled to the duration each pool represents (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8C</xref>). This similarity allows the readout neurons to decode the elapsed time of the firing rate of the neurons (the “states”) of the network at a given time. The scale invariance in the response of the pools is also an important prerequisite for the scalar property of timing errors, as we discuss in more detail below.</p>
<p>As we illustrate using a minimal model, the stereotypic response can be reproduced by a single neuron that is subject to random synaptic input and slow inhibition. For a given mean and standard deviation of the input, the firing of the neuron is governed by the binomial distribution. If the mean synaptic input increases over time, the firing rate approximates a cumulative normal distribution (<xref rid="fig14" ref-type="fig">Fig. 14</xref>). The scaling of this distribution is determined by the distance of the mean input current from the neuron’s rheobase, relative to its standard deviation. Thus, two ingredients are needed to explain the shape of the firing rate curves (and thus, the ability of the model to encode durations within a certain range): A synaptic current that changes systematically over time and a substantial variety of neuronal and synaptic parameters to allow different neurons (or pools of neurons) to encode different interval durations.</p>
<p>We conducted a series of correlation and ablation analyses in the full network model to identify the sources of these two factors. First, we found that the distance of the average current from the rheobase (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Fig. 10B</xref>) increases for pools that encode longer intervals, consistent with the theory derived from the minimal model. Regarding the source of the systematic change in the input current, ablation analyses identified the slow GABA<sub>B</sub> current as the most important component, as its ablation leads to a much more pronounced decrease of its slope in relation to a one-to-one relation (Vierordt’s law) and a higher trial-to-trial variability of duration estimates. The removal of shortterm plasticity (STP) leads to similar impairments but to a lesser degree (7A and D). Ablation of NMDA or removal of neuronal or synaptic heterogeneity did not have this effect (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tblA3">Suppl. Table A.3</xref>). On the other hand, removing GABA<sub>B</sub> and STP also does not abolish the ability of the model to encode time altogether. So apparently, synaptic processes with shorter time scales (AMPA and GABA<sub>A</sub>) can also provide a time code, albeit with less accuracy (larger deviations between subjective and objective duration) and precision (larger standard deviations across trials).</p>
<p>We also assessed potential limitations of the model in terms of the length of the intervals that can be encoded and the levels of noise that can be tolerated. Already within the range of tested interval durations, we observed deviations both from the one-to-one psychophysical law (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>) and the scalar property (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>) at interval durations above 500 ms. Both effects are even more pronounced when the network is trained for longer intervals, up to 2000 ms. Indeed, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">B</xref> suggest that there are two distinct linear regimes both for the psychophysical law and the scalar property for intervals above and below 500 ms, respectively. Finally, we observed a gradual broadening of the tuning curves of the readout neurons for intervals greater than 300 ms (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). Given the importance of GABA<sub>B</sub> for precise and accurate subsecond timing, it is reasonable that these limitations are related to the time constants of GABA<sub>B</sub>. Indeed, the rise and decay time of that current add up to 300 ms, the interval duration where the tuning curves begin to degrade. Longer intervals could potentially rely on short-term synaptic plasticity, with time constants ranging up to 700 ms. For longer intervals, other timing mechanisms could play a role, since there is also experimental evidence to support that time estimation in the brain is performed by a number of different mechanisms in various brain areas for distinct interval durations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">84</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">85</xref>].</p>
<p>The gradual decrease in timing accuracy with increasing noise levels (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C</xref>) as well as the deviation from the scalar property (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6D</xref>) can be explained similarly: As the levels of external noise increase, each output neuron becomes less predictive of the interval duration it represents, resulting in broader and shallower tuning curves, which are linked to both phenomena illustrated in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">D</xref>.</p>

<title>Implications for experimental results on subsecond timing</title>
<p><italic>Linear psychophysical law</italic></p>
<p>The linear relation between subjective and objective time is among the most robust psychophysical findings in time perception [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>] and thus, its fulfillment is seen as an important criterion for model validity. In the statedependent PFC model, the neural basis for the linear psychophysical law is the stereotypic firing rate profiles relative to the criterion time in each of the interval-sensitive pools of neurons. By extension, each of the readout neurons shows a similar tuning curve in response to the second stimulus, and thus, even stimuli that are presented at durations that are not explicitly trained for can be represented, as the (similar) tuning curves of the readout neurons encoding intervals nearby can provide a suitable interpolation. Small deviations from linearity can be seen at very short and very long durations (compare the dash-dotted line to data in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>), resulting from boundary effects (incomplete tuning curves, see <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>, dark blue and dark red curves). Independent of these effects, a decrease in the slope of the linear psychophysical law can also be observed in the model, and thus, an overestimation of shorter intervals and an underestimation of longer intervals (Vierordts law [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>]). We showed that under the assumption of moderate, perfectly constant standard deviations of the tuning curves for all interval-selective output neurons, an exact one-to-one relation between subjective and objective time follows. In contrast, Vierordt’s law occurs if the standard deviations of the tuning curves increase for output neurons that encode increasing interval durations. This is the case for intervals exceeding the dominant time scale of the model, the combined rise and decay time of the GABA<sub>B</sub> current, but also if this current is removed at all or increasing levels of external synaptic noise are added.</p>
<p>Previous studies have attempted to explain Vierordt’s law by finding that subjects overcome uncertainty during production tasks by optimizing their responses to the statistics of the previously shown trials. Fitting these results with various statistical models yielded the Bayesian framework as the best fit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">86</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">87</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">88</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>]. A recent study analyzed the results from the classic experiments of Vierordt within such a framework [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>] and found that much of the deviation from a one-to-one relation between subjective and objective time can be attributed to the specific experimental protocol used in these studies, namely a completely random variation of interval durations between trials. Within the Bayesian framework, a more naturalistic, gradual change of durations (using a random walk) abolished the distortion. Interestingly, when the authors performed a new experiment comparing both protocols, they found a residual distortion even in the random walk condition. The slope of the resulting psychophysical law (estimated in their <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>) is approximately 0.86 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>], which is remarkably close to the slope we report for the current model without any adaptations (0.83, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tblA3">Table A.3</xref>). Thus, it seems likely that Vierordt’s law arises as a combination of Bayesian integration of information from previous trials and a distortion that is intrinsic to the network that generates the current duration estimate. As additional evidence for this proposal, note that the functional form of the psychophysical law (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>) is similar to the one suggested by the Bayes least squares (BLS) model in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">86</xref>] (their <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3d</xref>), which also provided the best fit to psychophysical data.</p>
<p>Regarding the point of difference, the duration at which subjective and objective duration coincide despite a slope smaller than one, we found a relatively constant value around 500 ms for all different parameter sets as long as the same range of intervals (50 ms to 750 ms) is used to train the weights of the readout network. This value differs significantly from the arithmetic mean of all trained intervals (400 ms), which is supported by parts of the experimental literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>], but not others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>]. However, the indifference point increases when a wider range of intervals has been used for training (50 ms to 2000 ms), suggesting that the indifference point can be shifted by training.</p>

<title>The scalar property</title>
<p>The scalar property (or Weber’s law), the linear increase of the standard deviations of timing estimates with the mean duration, is an important experimental result that has often been cited as a cornerstone of time perception. Thus, any sensible model of time perception should be able to reproduce the scalar property, at least for a limited range of durations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">89</xref>].</p>
<p>For the present model, we expected a sublinear instead of linear scaling of timing errors, since such results were reported in a study on one of its variants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>]. Surprisingly, the scalar property did emerge in our version of the model (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>), up to durations that correspond to the time constants of the GABA<sub>B</sub> current. The importance of this current for the scalar property is underlined by the fact that its ablation leads to a drastic decrease of the cut-off duration, where Weber’s law is replaced by a constant timing error (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tblA4">Table A.4</xref>). We also found a plausible explanation for the origin of Weber’s law, combining profiles of firing probability that are scaled by the duration represented in each time-specific pool of neurons with a stereotyped temporal receptive field occurring from optimizing the readout from each of the pools in downstream units, both resulting in largely uniform shapes of temporal tuning curves in these output neurons and finally constant Weber fractions. In this regard, the mechanism generating Weber’s law bears similarity to the scalar filter banks in Grossberg’s spectral timing theory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">90</xref>] and also to the multiple synfire chains in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>], each of which accounting for a given time interval and contributing to a timing error that scales approximately linearly within a certain range of durations. In contrast to these studies, however, the pools of neurons that represent specific durations spontaneously arise from the heterogeneity in the synaptic parameters, rather than being imprinted into the model architecture.</p>
<p>Several previous studies have attempted to explain the emergence of Weber’s law from general mathematical principles. Hass and Herrmann [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>] have developed an information-theoretical framework to characterize the ability of a given model to reproduce the scalar property. They suggest that the sublinear (instead of linear) scaling of timing errors seen in many models may be caused by a common set of timing mechanisms that are based on the systematic change of some observable quantity in time, such as the firing rate of a neuron or spike in a specific neuron at a given time. The scalar property, on the other hand, is thought to emerge in models that use the increase of standard deviations itself (in a diffusion sense) to estimate time. The latter category comprises models that rely on purely stochastic transitions between neural states [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">91</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c92">92</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93">93</xref>]. For example, Simen et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93">93</xref>] describe the slow ramping of firing rates by a specific form of drift-diffusion process that is driven by state transitions following a Poisson distribution. The scalar property then follows from the fact that the time between two Poisson-distributed events follows an exponential distribution, which has a constant coefficient of variation (equivalent to the Weber fraction) of one. In the state-dependent PFC model, timing is not driven by purely stochastic forces, but by a systematic change in excitability that is mainly driven by the time constant of the GABA<sub>B</sub> current. Thus, it cannot be classified as a variance-driven model in terms of Hass and Herrmann [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>]. Rather, the scalar property is generated by the stereotypic firing rate curves and the fact that the mean and standard deviation of timing estimates always covary in a specific way, governed by the binomial distribution. One could characterize the state-dependent model as a covert mean-driven model, as the systematic change in excitability is not directly observable.</p>
<p>Note that timing errors saturate into a constant of longer intervals, deviating from Weber’s law (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). This kind of deviation is only rarely observed in experiments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>], while a more common observation is a steeper, superlinear increase in the error over time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">89</xref>]. A possible explanation for this discrepancy may be the fact that we only examined a single mechanism of time perception at a time. In the brain, several of these mechanisms are likely to coexist, potentially each with its own optimal time scale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>]. For example, the mechanism of ramping activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>] has been shown to represent durations of up to several seconds. If this mechanism coexists with the state-dependent mechanism we investigated here, it is likely that the overall time estimate is taken over by ramping activity at intervals that are too long to be represented by the state-dependent network. Under this assumption, the constant timing error predicted for longer durations is not seen because, for those intervals, another, more suitable mechanism takes over. Theoretical frameworks for the integration of different sources of time estimates have been previously proposed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c94">94</xref>], including our own proposal of a “temporal hub”, potentially located within the basal ganglia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c95">95</xref>]. Assessing how the combination of timing mechanisms with different time scales in such a hub would affect the scaling of timing errors seems to be an important direction for future research.</p>
<p>Finally, we note that the deviation from Weber’s law and the deviation of the slope of the psychophysical law from one (Vierordt’s law) are based on the same mechanism, at least in this model. Regarding experimental studies, this connection suggests that it may be worthwhile to study both laws together when searching for transitions between different mechanisms of timing or ablating specific neuronal of synaptic mechanisms in real neural systems.</p>

<title>Dopaminergic modulation</title>
<p>The third major experimental result we aimed to reproduce in this study was the modulation of subjective duration by dopamine (DA). We modeled the effects of the D2 dopamine receptor on synaptic and neuronal properties based on results from <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments and, indeed, found that subjective duration is lengthened by D2 activation and shortened by D2 inactivation (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>), as it has been consistently seen in experiments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref>]. As shown in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>, the change in subjective duration is mostly driven by the modulation of the synaptic parameters, namely a 20 % decrease in NMDA and 50 % decrease in GABA peak conductances at 100 % D2 activation compared to 0 % (see Methods for details). As GABA decreases much more compared to NMDA, activation of D2 results in a net increase in network excitability. As time is encoded by means of the firing rates in each of the pools in response to the second stimulus (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8D</xref>), increased excitability implies that any given firing rate will be reached faster under D2 activation and thus the subjective duration will be shorter than the objective duration. The opposite is true for D2 inactivation.</p>
<p>Understanding this mechanism of dopaminergic modulation of subsecond timing also helps to explain how the model reproduces a number of effects that are also seen in experiments. First, the scalar property is unaffected by mild D2 modulation (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>), consistent with experimental results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c96">96</xref>]. As D2 activation (or inactivation) simply changes the excitability of the entire network, neurons in all pools are shifted towards earlier (or later) responses, while the relation between means and standard deviations of firing rates that cause the scalar property remains intact. Second, the retraining of the output neurons fully compensates for the modulation of D2 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>). This is consistent with experimental findings on the chronic application of dopaminergic drugs such as methamphetamine to rats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c97">97</xref>] and also, more broadly, results suggesting neuroadaptive processes in response to chronic activation of the dopaminergic system, e.g., by addiction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c98">98</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c99">99</xref>]. We can explain this effect by a synaptic mapping of neurons within the network that changed their optimal reaction to the second stimulus to an earlier or later time under chronic dopaminergic influence. For example, if neurons in a pool that encode 100 ms are sensitive to 150 ms under D2 inactivation, retraining would assign them to the output neuron that encodes 150 ms. Thus, the change in subjective duration can be fully compensated if the modulation is present long enough such that the synaptic connections to the output neurons can rewire accordingly. This is the case if the activation or deactivation of D2 is chronic and stable over time. Finally, we observed limitations in both the durations of the intervals and the activation and deactivation levels of D2 within which the subsecond timing works properly. In particular, for D2 activations beyond 50 %, as well as interval durations shorter than 200 ms, the subsecond timing basically stops working. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figA4">Suppl. Fig. A.4</xref>, we see that all time estimates collapse to a single value for values far beyond these boundaries. Deactivation of D2 shows similar effects, but subjective durations can still be differentiated for intervals above 200 ms at deactivations of − 100 % (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figA4">Suppl. Fig. A.4</xref>). Indeed, experimental results using D2 receptor agonists point in the same direction as our findings on D2 receptor activations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c96">96</xref>]. More specifically, the study shows that the scalar property breaks down at higher concentrations of the agonist. Within our model, we can explain these results as a boundary effect: An increase in D2 activity makes the entire model overly excitable. Thus, the different pools lose their ability to differentiate between different intervals and the timing over a range of intervals is impaired. This proposal is supported by the fact that subjective durations for the different pools collapse to a single value as D2 activation approaches 100 % (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figA4">Suppl. Fig. A.4</xref>) and that subjective durations in pools encoding short intervals (dark blue lines) do so for smaller D2 activation levels, as they are more excitable to begin with.</p>
<p>It is important to mention that, in contrast to the agonistic modulation, the antagonistic DA modulation could only be extrapolated by inverting the parameter changes of the agonistic modulation, due to the lack of experimental data. This inversion can be interpreted as a deactivation of tonically active D2 receptors. Although it is not guaranteed that such a deactivation will yield the exact opposite of the activation, it seems unlikely that the net effects on synaptic conductances will be qualitatively different, given the large differences of the effects on NMDA and GABA for the agonist. Nevertheless, future experiments should explicitly measure the parameter changes for DA antagonists to validate our assumptions.</p>
<p>Although there is sufficient evidence for a D2 receptor-based dopaminergic modulation of duration estimates in the subsecond range [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref>], most studies have been performed in the seconds to minutes range [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref>]. However, we emphasize that the basic mechanism of dopaminergic modulation is not necessarily restricted to the subsecond range. As D2 activation results in a net increase in network excitability, any duration estimate based on neuronal or synaptic activity will be affected in the same way as described above. In particular, we could think of additional neuronal or synaptic processes with longer time scales that extend the range of interval durations the state-dependent network model could represent.</p>
<p>Finally, note that we have restricted our analysis to the D2 dopamine receptor, as most effects on subjective duration have been reported in relation to this receptor type [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>] and it has been shown that the binding affinity of a variety of drugs to the D2 receptor predicts the effect on time perception [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref>]. Moreover, the effects of D1 receptor activation are likely more complex than a simple change in excitability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c100">100</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c101">101</xref>], so we would not expect a systematic change in subjective duration within this model. However, it should be noted that more recent studies also showed effects of D1 on time perception, in particular in the context of ramping activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c102">102</xref>]. Therefore, it would be worthwhile to investigate the underlying mechanisms of this modulation as well and to assess the circumstances under which the modulation of D1 and D2 is the most important, respectively.</p>

<title>Relation to the original state-dependent model</title>
<p>Here, we compare our state-dependent PFC model with the original statedependent model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>]. Using 500 neurons, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>] showed normalized output spikes up to 250 ms when 50 ms steps are used for training and spikes up to 400 ms when 100 ms steps are used. Our time constants for GABA<sub>B</sub> are similar, as they have the same rise time <italic>τ</italic><sub><italic>rise</italic></sub> = 100 ms, but a slightly longer decay time <italic>τ</italic><sub><italic>decay</italic></sub> = 200 ms based on the electrophysiological literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">76</xref>] (compared to <italic>τ</italic><sub><italic>decay</italic></sub> = 166 ms in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>]). Within the range 50 - 250 ms, we were also able to show similar output patterns, but for longer intervals, our output peaks become broader. However, our model was able to perform discrimination tasks up to 750 ms.</p>
<p>For the original state-dependent model, Buonomano showed reduced timing performance when GABA<sub>B</sub> or STP were removed, consistent with our results. Furthermore, we showed that reducing the heterogeneity of STP by allowing only one type of STP within each given neuron type combination greatly impaired timing performance. To understand the phenomenon, note that the dominant STP type for E-to-E connections is facilitating, while for I-to-I connections, it is depressing. Thus, if we limit STP to a single, preferred type for each connection types, the network is put into a regime where excitation is facilitated and inhibition is depressed at the same time. This combination will likely make the network excessively excitable as a whole, affecting the necessary differentiation in excitability between pools. In a recent study of persistent activity within the same PFC network [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c103">103</xref>], we observed that persistent activity stabilized when the STP was homogeneous compared to no STP at all (and also heterogeneous STP, which prevented persistent activity at all). This finding also supports the idea that the excitability of the network is enhanced by homogeneous STP, similar to excessively strong activation of the D2 receptor (see previous section).</p>
<p>Furthermore, Buonomano claimed that temporal tuning was specifically achieved by the variability of synaptic weights, and homogenous synaptic weights prevented interval discrimination. On the contrary, when we performed simulations with homogeneous neuronal and synaptic parameters, timing could still be achieved. Apart from synaptic weights, connectivity might also play an important role in our timing tasks. For instance, neurons that receive few negative inputs from inhibitory neurons can easily be reactivated for a second interval compared to neurons that receive more inhibitory inputs.</p>
<p>In summary, timing of a range of different intervals requires a process with long time constants such as GABA<sub>B</sub>, and heterogeneity in the parameters that determine the excitability of a neuron. Even if one component is removed, there might be other heterogeneous parameters within the network that help to differentiate the neurons to obtain interval discrimination, given sufficient heterogeneity. Furthermore, we note that GABA<sub>B</sub> is not the only option for enabling subsecond timing in the range of hundreds of milliseconds. In principle, any process with a sufficiently long time constant could be used, for example, the influx of calcium ions following a spike that has already been explored in the context of the ramping activity model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>].</p>
<p>The fact that the state-dependent PFC model showed the scalar property was surprising, since a previous study on the original state-dependent network model showed a sublinear rather than a linear scaling of timing errors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>]. We showed that timing errors (averaged over several combinations of parameters) are best fitted with a linear part for shorter intervals and a constant part for longer ones (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). For any individual parameter combination, the constant part at longer intervals is less clearly visible (e.g., <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>) and may be mistaken for a decreasing slope in an overall sublinear scaling. Taken together, these results suggest that a reanalysis of the previous data, pooling different parameter sets and considering a saturation of timing errors at longer intervals, may yield results that are similar to ours. On the other hand, the intervals considered in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>] regarding timing error did not exceed 200 ms, a duration in which a sublinear increase of the standard deviation may be due to the generalized form of Weber’s law [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c104">104</xref>]. On the contrary, the intervals considered in the present study are sufficiently long to examine the scalar property.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Computational models provide opportunities to understand the neural mechanisms that underlie time perception. We chose a set of key experimental findings to test such models against, namely, the psychophysical law (including Vierordt’s law), the scalar property of timing errors, and the dopaminergic modulation of subjective duration. The state-dependent PFC model is capable of reproducing each of these findings for interval durations between 50 and 750 ms, including the scalar property, one of the most enigmatic results in time perception. The model even reproduces several details of the experiments such as the magnitude of the Weber fraction and the slope of Vierordt’s law, the dependence of the indifference point upon the range of presented intervals, and the effect of the D2 dopamine receptor on the scalar property. Remarkably, no explicit tuning of the network parameters was necessary to obtain these results, except for the synaptic weights for the read-out network. Beyond providing strong support for the present variant of the state-dependent model, these results also strengthen confidence in the underlying network model of the prefrontal cortex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>], which has already been shown to reproduce key features of <italic>in vivo</italic> neural activity without the need for parameter adjustment and produced unintuitive results with respect to working memory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>].</p>
<p>Taken together, the state-dependent model of time perception, originally proposed by Buonomano [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>] and implemented here within a realistic PFC model, can now be considered the first timing theory validated by a range of important experimental results. However, this does not rule out alternative theories at all, especially for interval durations beyond 750 ms. Other prominent approaches such as models of ramping activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>], synfire chains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>] and the striatal beat model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>] can now be tested in the same way. This will likely lead to a range of validated theories of time perception and a more thorough understanding of how the brain tells time under different circumstances, such as different ranges of durations.</p>

<p>To test timing within a realistic prefrontal cortex model, we used the spiking neural network model proposed by [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>]. This model can reproduce key features of <italic>in vivo</italic> activity, as the neuronal parameters and synaptic parameters were constrained by anatomical and electrophysiological data from <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments on rodents.

<p>The network consists of 1000 simpAdEx neurons with parameters randomly drawn from experimentally validated distributions and pairwise connection probabilities from the literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>].

Both opening and closing are subject to a synaptic transmission delay <italic>τ</italic><sub><italic>D</italic></sub> and the NMDA synapses were simulated by multiplying the synaptic current by a nonlinear voltage-dependent term <italic>s</italic>(<italic>V</italic>) to simulate magnesium blockade at lower voltages, see <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn7">Eq. 7</xref>.</p>
<p>Each synaptic connection is equipped with short-term plasticity via <italic>a</italic> in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn7">Eq. 7</xref>, implemented by the corrected version of [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c105">105</xref>]. Three different types of plasticity are implemented within the prefrontal cortex (PFC) model, namely short-term facilitation (E1/I1), short-term depression (E2/I2) and a combined version of both (E3/I3) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">74</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">75</xref>]. The cell types of the pre-and postsynaptic neurons determine which of these classes is used for each individual combination. In particular, connections among pyramidal cells, among interneurons, and between fast-spiking interneurons and pyramidal exhibit all three types of connections to varying degrees (pyramidal to pyramidal: 45% E1, 38% E2, 17% E3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">75</xref>]; interneuron to interneuron: 29% I1, 58% I2, 13% I3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">74</xref>], fast-spiking interneuron to pyramidal: 25% I1, 50% I2, 25% I3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">74</xref>]). A constant background current of <italic>I</italic><sub>exc</sub> = 250 pA was applied to excitatory neurons and a current of <italic>I</italic><sub>inh</sub> = 200 pA to inhibitory neurons. For more details, see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>].</p>
<p>The original model was supplemented with GABA<sub>B</sub>-type synapses to simulate slow IPSPs, which were found to be important within the state-space model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>]. The synaptic parameters for the conductance-based double exponential functions of GABA<sub>B</sub> were extracted from Golomb et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">76</xref>], see <xref rid="tbl4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>. The maximum conductance of GABA<sub>A</sub> and GABA<sub>B</sub> was also reduced by multiplying by a factor of 0.3 to counteract the excess inhibition within the network. The extended model still reproduces features of the original PFC model. In particular, the inter-spike intervals and the coefficient of variation (CV) per neuron are in the same range with and without GABA<sub>B</sub> (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figA1">Suppl. Fig. A.1C, D</xref>. The time-averaged subthreshold membrane fluctuations of non-zero firing neurons are also consistent with GABA<sub>B</sub> (<italic>μ</italic> = 3.1 mV, <italic>σ</italic> = 2.1 mV) and without GABA<sub>B</sub> (<italic>μ</italic> = 2.1 mV, <italic>σ</italic> = 1.3 mV), cf. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figA1">Suppl.

<p>After running the simulations, we extracted the states of all neurons (<italic>N</italic> = 1000) within a given time window ∆<italic>t</italic><sub><italic>w</italic></sub> following the readout mechanisms of a liquid state machine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">77</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">78</xref>] (cf. <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>).

To predict interval durations, a readout layer was added to the model with the number of output units <italic>N</italic><sub><italic>r</italic></sub> matching the number of interval durations presented during training, cf. color-coded readout units in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>. Each output unit is then trained to be active for the respective time interval and to be inactive for all other time intervals. The readout weights were trained for all stimulus intervals and trials by maximizing the activity of the readout units for their corresponding stimulus intervals and minimizing activity for the remaining stimulus intervals.</p>
<p>The training of the readout weights was realized by calculating the least squares of the expected targets, cf. <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>. After training with <italic>N</italic><sub>training,trials</sub> = 300 trials, the performance of time estimation was tested by presenting test intervals in 25 ms steps from 50 ms up to 750 ms and calculating the outputs of the previously trained readout weights. To predict the interval durations of the interstimulus intervals presented, the negative output values were first set to 0, then the positive values were normalized by the sum of all readout neurons, multiplied by the respective training time intervals, and summed across all readout units. The standard deviation of the estimated time was calculated on <italic>N</italic><sub>test,trials</sub> = 50 test trials. Including the negative output values in the estimate did not significantly change the results.</p>
<p>The hyperparameters that determine the states are the endpoint <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="474629v4_inline13.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> and the length of the window ∆<italic>t</italic><sub><italic>w</italic></sub> from which the spikes were extracted, and the exponential weight decay rate <italic>τ</italic> .

<title>Dopaminergic modulation</title>
<p>The agonistic and antagonistic D2 receptor modulations were simulated by modifying various neuronal and synaptic properties. To alter neuronal parameters, we extracted the changes from our own unpublished data, in which the D2 receptor agonist, quinpirole, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c107">107</xref>] was applied with a concentration of 10 <italic>μ</italic>M. On the contrary, changes in synaptic conductance were extracted from the literature (see <xref rid="tbl5" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>). Specifically, we interpreted the changes in neuronal and synaptic modulation under the application of dopamine (DA) as 100 % agonistic modulation, cf. <xref rid="tbl5" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>, the properties without application of DA as 0 % modulation and linearly interpolated between these two to simulate various DA concentrations in between.</p>

<p>Although experimental data for the change in neuronal parameters are available for DA agonists, the corresponding data for DA antagonists are lacking. Therefore, we assumed exactly opposite effects for DA antagonists and extrapolated the change in neuronal and synaptic parameters from 0 % to − 100 % to simulate antagonistic modulation via DA.</p>
<p>To measure the effects of an acute change in neuronal activity induced by DA, we applied the modulation at test time without retraining the readout weights, whereas for the examination of long-term plasticity-based adaptions induced by DA, we also retrained the readout weights in a second step for the case of ±30 % agonistic and antagonistic modulation.</p>

<title>Noise</title>
<p>To simulate variability between trials, an input layer of Poisson neurons (<italic>N</italic><sub>Poisson</sub> = 10)) was added so that each PFC neuron on average received input from one Poisson neuron (<italic>p</italic><sub>poisson</sub> = 0.1) with a firing rate of <italic>f</italic> = 1 Hz. A typical cortical neuron receives connections from approximately 1000-10 000 other neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">80</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">81</xref>]. Therefore, we examined the effect of higher input variability while performing the limitation studies (see Limitations of the model in Results) in our model by increasing the firing rates of our Poisson process to <italic>f</italic> =1000 Hz, thereby emulating 1000 additional inputs. To test different noise levels, we increased the synaptic weights of Poisson neurons (<italic>w</italic><sub>Poisson</sub>), and in parallel reduced the background current (<italic>I</italic><sub>back</sub>) to prevent overexcitation (see <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> for details). For each synaptic weight factor, the background current was optimized using a grid search to minimize the RMSE of the average firing rates per neuron type and layer. The time-averaged subthreshold membrane potential fluctuation, i.e., after removal of spikes, was shown to be at 4 mV in experiments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c112">112</xref>], which could already be reproduced within the PFC model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>]. For decreased background current and accordingly increased noise levels as described above, we find that subthreshold membrane potential fluctuations are within the range of 2 − 4 mV, cf. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figA7">Suppl.

<title>Minimal model</title>
<p>In order to further understand how the network firing rate changes over time, we constructed a minimal model comprising a single neuron that is subject to the same synaptic currents and external inputs that are present in the model PFC. The neuron is modeled as a leaky integrate-and-fire neuron with parameters that are identical to the average values for an L23 pyramidal cell in the PFC model (<italic>C</italic>=170 pF, <italic>g</italic><sub><italic>L</italic></sub>=5.85 nS, <italic>E</italic><sub><italic>L</italic></sub>=−75.5 mV, <italic>V</italic><sub>th</sub>=−65 mV). AMPA, GABA<sub>A</sub>, NMDA, and GABA<sub>B</sub> synapses are modeled as in the PFC model (without STP). Except for GABA<sub>B</sub>, all synapses are stimulated by a Poisson spike train with <italic>λ</italic> = 0.25, simulating random spike trains in 4000 Hz for both excitatory and inhibitory synapses, balancing excitation and inhibition. To reproduce the effect of GABA<sub>B</sub> after the first stimulation, the GABA<sub>B</sub> synapse is only stimulated by 20 spikes during the first 20 ms of the simulation in response to the first stimulus that marks the beginning of the interval. This simplification is justified by the fact that the first stimulus elicits a much stronger effect on GABA<sub>B</sub> compared to the ongoing activity and this strong initial activation is one of the essential features of the model that enables time perception. The neuron is subject to a constant background current of 40 pA, which is increased to 90 pA for 20 ms at the time of the second stimulus. The duration of the interval is varied between 50 ms and 500 ms in steps of 25 ms. We simulated <italic>N</italic> = 100 independent neurons and computed the mean and standard deviation of the membrane potential over all neurons at each of these durations. Assuming a normal distribution of the membrane potential, we then computed the probability <italic>p</italic> of the membrane potential to exceed the firing threshold <italic>V</italic><sub>th</sub> and interpreted <italic>N</italic>· <italic>p</italic> as the firing rate at a given time, which is depicted in <xref rid="fig14" ref-type="fig">Fig. 14</xref>. The different curves in this figure were generated by varying <italic>V</italic><sub>th</sub> between − 67 and − 63 mV in steps of 0.1 mV. Similar results are obtained by simply counting the number of neurons exceeding <italic>V</italic><sub>th</sub> in each case.</p>

<title>Origin of the scalar property for more than one pool and output neuron</title>
<p>In the main text, we have shown how the scalar property arises from the stereotypical firing rate profiles across interval-encoding pools IEPs and the fixed relation between the mean and the standard deviation of the firing rates according to the binomial distribution. We only considered the special case that a) the estimated interval is one of the intervals that are encoded in one of the pools (<italic>t</italic> = <italic>T</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>), and b) there is only a single pool and output neuron, both of which encode this interval <italic>T</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>. While this case is instructive to understand the mechanism of the scalar property, it is necessary to generalize the considerations of the main text to arbitrary interval durations and multiple pools and output neurons (although usually, a few pools and output neurons are sufficient due to the narrow tuning curves). A full mathematical derivation of this case is beyond the scope of the current paper. Instead, we outline the general rationale here and aim to verify each of the corresponding assumptions with data from the network model.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figA9">SI Fig. B.9A</xref> shows the relation between the mean and the standard deviation of the activity of each of the output neurons <italic>O</italic><sub><italic>j</italic></sub> (cf. lines and shaded areas in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2A</xref>). This relation can be well-fitted to the function <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="474629v4_inline16.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> with a relatively constant <italic>c</italic><sub><italic>j</italic></sub> across output neurons <italic>j</italic> (0.26 ± 0.04). As the duration estimate <italic>T</italic><sub>est</sub>(<italic>t</italic>) is formed by summing over the activities <italic>O</italic><sub><italic>j</italic></sub> of each output neuron multiplied by the duration <italic>T</italic><sub><italic>j</italic></sub> that neuron represents, mean and standard deviation of the estimate are given by <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="474629v4_inline17.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="474629v4_inline18.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>, respectively.</p>
<p>Assume that we want to compute both quantities at a given time <italic>t</italic><sup>∗</sup>. Under the assumption that all tuning curves <italic>&lt; O</italic><sub><italic>j</italic></sub> <italic>&gt;</italic> have the same shape, namely mean-shifted Gaussians with constant standard deviations (SI Fig. B.10A), we can interpret the values <italic>&lt; O</italic><sub><italic>j</italic></sub>(<italic>t</italic><sup>∗</sup>) <italic>&gt;</italic> of the different output functions <italic>j</italic> at this time <italic>t</italic><sup>∗</sup> as the values of a single function <italic>&lt; O</italic>(<italic>t</italic>) <italic>&gt;</italic> at different times <italic>t</italic> that reflect the shift of the mean of each of the different Gaussians (SI Fig. B.10B). Given the fact that the output activities are normalized such that Σ<sub><italic>j</italic></sub> <italic>&lt; O</italic><sub><italic>j</italic></sub>(<italic>t</italic>) <italic>&gt;</italic>= 1 for all times <italic>t</italic>, we can interpret <italic>&lt; O</italic>(<italic>t</italic>) <italic>&gt;</italic> as the probability distribution of the time <italic>t</italic> elapsed relative to <italic>t</italic><sup>∗</sup>. Thus, the average of elapsed time with respect to <italic>&lt; O</italic>(<italic>t</italic>) <italic>&gt;</italic> (or <italic>&lt; O</italic><sub><italic>j</italic></sub>(<italic>t</italic><sup>∗</sup>) <italic>&gt;</italic>, equivalently) is <italic>t</italic><sup>∗</sup> and we can write

In the generalized Weber law, a constant error dominates the standard deviations of the timing estimates from short durations, resulting in a decreasing Weber fraction, until the linear part dominates for longer intervals and the Weber fraction becomes constant. Indeed, the state-dependent PFC model shows this often-observed behavior of the Weber fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2D</xref>).</p>
<p>We test the accuracy of the above calculations by computing the Weber fraction <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="474629v4_inline21.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> from the data in two ways: First, as the ratio between the standard deviations <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="474629v4_inline22.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> and the means <italic>&lt; T</italic><sub>est</sub>(<italic>t</italic><sup>∗</sup>) <italic>&gt;</italic>, which yields <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="474629v4_inline23.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> for long enough intervals (see above). And second, as the square root of the sum of the variances in all output ne urons <italic>O</italic><sub><italic>j</italic></sub>. This second relation, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="474629v4_inline24.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> follows from the normalization Σ<sub><italic>j</italic></sub> <italic>&lt; O</italic><sub><italic>j</italic></sub>(<italic>t</italic>) <italic>&gt;</italic>= 1 in combination with <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="474629v4_inline25.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> . Indeed, the results of the two calculations are in good agreement with each other (SI Fig. B.9B), except for the expected deviations for short intervals.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
This paper addresses the important question of the neural mechanisms underlying interval discrimination. The authors develop a detailed and biologically plausible model based on a previously proposed theory of timing. The model proposes that the interval between two stimuli can be encoded in the state of the neuronal and synaptic properties, specifically those with time constants on the order of hundreds of milliseconds, such as short-term synaptic plasticity and GABAb currents. Based on biological parameters in the PFC the authors show that the model can account for interval discrimination for up to 750 ms. Furthermore, the model accounts for three well-established psychophysical properties of interval timing: the linear relation between objective and neural time, the scalar property/Weber's law, and dopaminergic modulation of timing (although this property is less robust). Of particular novelty is the demonstration of Weber's law, and an explanation of how many complex and nonlinear neuronal properties produce a linear relationship between the standard deviation of interval estimates and their mean.</p>
<p>This is an interesting paper that addresses a significant gap in the field. However, I have one major concern. As I understood the methods (and I may have misunderstood) it seems that the readout units are not operating in continuous time, and that interval discrimination relies in part on external information. Specifically, the readout units only look at the spike counts during the window delta_t_w. Thus, discrimination between 100 and 200 ms looks only at the spikes at 120-145 and 220-245, respectively, meaning that the experimenters are providing interval information for the readout of the intervals being discriminated. If this is indeed the case the model is fairly limited in biological plausibility and significantly dampens my enthusiasm for the paper.</p>
<p>Stimulus onset occurs at 1500 ms in order to allow the network to stabilize. Ideally, this value should be randomized across trials to ensure performance generalizes across initial states.</p>
<p>Why does StDev saturate? Is that because subjective time saturates as well?</p>
<p>The model captures the effect of D2 receptors observed in some timing studies, specifically and DR2 activation increases &quot;clock&quot; speed. In the discussion, it would be nice to explain that dopaminergic modulation of subjective timing is not as universally observed as the linear psychophysical law or the scalar property, and I believe somewhat controversial (e.g., Ward, ..., Balsam, 2009).</p>
<p>(NB: Regarding my potential concern that that the decoding was performed in discontinuous time, the authors have clarified that decoding was done in continuous time--i.e., each output unit was trained to respond to a given time bin of the target interval but exposed to all time bins of all intervals during testing. Thus confirming the robustness of their decoding procedure and model.)</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
The paper explores a mathematical model of subsecond time perception, engaging with established theories such as the linear psychophysical law, Weber's law, and dopaminergic modulation of subjective durations. While it ambitiously attempts to confirm specific mechanisms of time perception and presents a comprehensive description of these mechanisms, the work is presented as data-driven but its empirical backing and model generalization capabilities are questionable. The title's implication of a robust empirical foundation is misleading, as the main figures do not reflect empirical data directly but rather model outputs aligned with general trends in psychophysical studies. This disjunction raises concerns about the model's applicability and the strength of the claims made regarding time perception mechanisms.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
(1) The paper describes specific mechanisms of time perception, providing a theoretical examination of linear psychophysical law, Weber's law, and dopaminergic modulation. This aspect is valuable for readers seeking a theoretical understanding of temporal perception.</p>
<p>(2) The authors describe a range of psychophysical studies and theories, attempting to position their model within the broader scientific discourse on time perception.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
(1) Lack of Empirical Data: The absence of two things: 1) quantification of error between model and empirical data with interpretation of what this degree of error means, and 2) clear comparisons between model and empirical data in all figures and tables, to substantiate the model's predictions stands out. The reliance on general trends rather than specific empirical studies undermines the strength and reliability of the model's claims. The paper would benefit from quantitative and qualitative simulations of results from specific, large-sample studies to anchor the model's predictions in concrete empirical evidence.</p>
<p>(2) Methodological Ambiguities: The training and testing procedures lack robust checks for generalization, leading to potential overfitting issues. Clarifications are needed on whether and how the model reaches a steady state before stimulation and the implications of the chosen model time constants in the absence of stimulation. The overlap between training (50ms) and testing (25ms) steps and the implications for model generalization need validation with &quot;traditional&quot; parameter fitting protocols, such as formal model cross-validation across well-defined datasets and splits, as well as evaluations to understand and assess potential overfitting.</p>
<p>(3) Inadequate Visualization of Empirical Data: References to empirical data are vague and not directly visualized alongside model outputs. Future iterations should include empirical data, not general trends from psychophysics, in figures for a clear comparison.</p>
<p>(4) Limitations in Model Scope and Dynamics: The exploration of limitations is narrowly focused on interval length and noise. Expanding the model limitations to consider isochronous pulse processing and the emergence of limit-cycle behaviors after prolonged stimulation would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the model's capabilities and limitations. Additionally, the justification for using \(N_{Poisson}\) as a proxy for more connections is unclear and warrants a more direct approach. Adding more units to a truly data-driven model should be trivial.</p>
<p>(5) Omissions and Redundancies: Certain omissions, such as the lack of a condition in Figure 7A or missing references to relevant models and reviews, detract from the paper's thoroughness. Moreover, some statements and terms like &quot;internal clock&quot; are used without a clear mechanistic definition within the model.</p>
<p>Guidance for Readers</p>
<p>
Readers should approach this paper as a theoretical exploration into the mechanisms of subsecond-time perception. The model offers a detailed theoretical framework that engages with established laws and theories in time perception. However, it's crucial to note the model's reliance on general trends and its lack of direct empirical backing. The findings should be interpreted as a hypothesis-generating exercise rather than conclusive evidence.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>In the first version of the review, the reviewer implied that each readout unit only receives input during a small window around the interval it represents. However, this is not the case. The small window that is depicted in Fig. 16 is a sliding window that is used to compute the states (i.e., an estimate of the instantaneous firing rate) at each point in time. The fact that the readout units indeed do operate in continuous time is apparent from Fig. 2A, showing the activity of all output units as a function of time: There is gradually changing activity with a peak at the represented interval. If each unit would only receive input during a window of a couple milliseconds, there would be a single peak of activity at the represented interval, and near-zero activity at any other time.</p>
<p>This misunderstanding has been cleared out in the current version of the review (see last paragraph of review #1).</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>This is a valid point which we will address in the revision. However, we note that experimentation with different onset values did not change the dynamics of the network systematically in previous studies (i.e., Hass et al., 2022).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Why does StDev saturate? Is that because subjective time saturates as well?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Indeed, the two phenomena are closely related. In section “Deviations from the scalar property and the origin on Vierordt’s law”, we discuss that both is caused by the broadening of the tuning curves of the readout units (Fig 1A) as the longest time constants of the network are exceeded.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>We are thankful for this advice and will adapt the discussion accordingly in the revision. Still, we note that dopaminergic modulation of subjective timing is one of the more robust effects observed in several time perception experiments.</p>

<p>(1) Lack of Empirical Data: […] The paper would benefit from quantitative and qualitative simulations of results from specific, large-sample studies to anchor the model's predictions in concrete empirical evidence.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>While it is correct that this study does not attempt the replicate a concrete empirical study, we note that do compare the model's results with specific studies wherever possible. The comparison is done on the level of parameters of functional relationships: For the linear psychophysical law, we compare the slope and the indifference point of the model with those from experimental studies. For the scalar property, we compare the Weber fraction of the model to those computed from experiments. For dopaminergic modulation of subjective duration, no direct comparison with experimental data is possible, as the levels of modulation are estimated from in vitro experiments and cannot be directly compared with modulations in vivo. However, we discuss a range of qualitative observations in experiments that are reproduced (and explained) by the model.</p>
<p>The above arguments notwithstanding, one can discuss whether the presentation of the experimental results and the comparison with the simulations is appropriate, and we do plan to extend this presentation in a revision.</p>

<p>(2) Methodological Ambiguities: The training and testing procedures lack robust checks for generalization, leading to potential overfitting issues.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>It is correct that formal checks for generalization, such as cross-validation protocols, are missing, and we will include them in the revision. However, as we obtained a mechanistic understanding of how the model tells time, we are confident that our results are not due to overfitting.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) Inadequate Visualization of Empirical Data: References to empirical data are vague and not directly visualized alongside model outputs. Future iterations should include empirical data, not general trends from psychophysics, in figures for a clear comparison.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As mentioned above, the comparison between simulation and empirical data will be extended in a revision. However, we argue that the “general trends”, namely adherence of the model to the often-reported psychophysical regularities, are of greater importance compared to the replication of, e.g. one specific slope of the linear psychophysical law, which does vary a lot between experiments.</p>

<p>(4) Limitations in Model Scope and Dynamics: […] Expanding the model limitations to consider isochronous pulse processing and the emergence of limit-cycle behaviors after prolonged stimulation would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the model's capabilities and limitations.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The current research focuses on the estimation of a single duration rather than the processing of sequences of durations. Sequence processing is a vast field, and it has been argued that it comprises different mechanisms compared to duration estimation. Thus, we feel that including sequences processing would be beyond the scope of the already quite extensive paper. However, we will discuss a possible extension of the model to sequence processing in the revision.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Additionally, the justification for using(N_{Poisson}) as a proxy for more connections is unclear and warrants a more direct approach.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We considered different means to vary the noise input into the network, including changes in the number of connections. We ultimately chose to vary the firing rate of a fixed number of Poisson input neurons. As the sum of the firing rates of N independent Poisson neurons with the same f is simply N*f and the synaptic contributions from each spike also linearly add up, this is equivalent to adding more Poisson neurons and thus, more connections.</p>

<p>(5) Omissions and Redundancies: Certain omissions, such as the lack of a condition in Figure 7A or missing references to relevant models and reviews, detract from the paper's thoroughness.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The reviewer refers to a condition where everything is ablated except NMDA. We will include such a condition in the revision. Regarding missing references, the reviewer requests including references that focus on sequence processing. While the focus of the current work is on estimating a single duration rather than a sequence of durations (see above), we will include a review on this topic as an outlook on this possible extension of the model.</p>
