<title>Abstract</title><p>In most murine species, spermatozoa exhibit a falciform apical hook at the head end. The function of the sperm hook is not yet clearly understood. In this study, we investigate the role of the sperm hook in the migration of spermatozoa through the female reproductive tract in <italic>Mus musculus</italic> (C57BL/6), using a deep tissue imaging custom-built two-photon microscope. Through live reproductive tract imaging, we found evidence indicating that the sperm hook aids in the attachment of spermatozoa to the epithelium and facilitates interactions between spermatozoa and the epithelium during migration in the uterus and oviduct. We also observed synchronised sperm beating, which resulted from the spontaneous unidirectional rearrangement of spermatozoa in the uterus. Based on live imaging of spermatozoa-epithelium interaction dynamics, we propose that the sperm hook plays a crucial role in successful migration through the female reproductive tract by providing anchor-like mechanical support and facilitating interactions between spermatozoa and the female reproductive tract in the house mouse.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Since the pioneering work by Parker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Parker, 1970</xref>), postcopulatory sexual selection has been recognised as an important driving force that shapes male sperm and female reproductive track characteristics. Post-copulatory sperm competition over gamete and cryptic female choice are equivalent to male-male competition and female choice in the pre-copulatory sexual selection. Sperm competition occurs when spermatozoa from more than one male coincide within the female reproductive tract in a time window where they have a chance to fertilize the same egg (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Parker, 1970</xref>). The evolutionary consequences of the sperm competition for the male traits, including baculum complexity, sperm shape and behaviour, are demonstrated in a wide range of animals from insects to mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Anderson et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Lange et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">AndrÃ© et al., 2020</xref>). Such male adaptations secure sperm delivery to the female reproductive tract and influence sequential mating of the already mated female with other males. Cryptic female choice is a more complicated process to define as it is achieved at the various stages of the post-mating fertilization process that also occurs inside the female reproductive tract. However, post-copulatory cryptic female choice is evident where a female can exert an influence on ejaculates or even fertilised eggs that can influence maleâs reproductive success (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Eberhard, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Firman et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Roberts et al., 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>Postcopulatory sexual selection results in co-evolution of the male and female traits that impact the reproductive strategies of the opposite sex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Eberhard and Lehmann, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Greff and Parker, 2000</xref>). For example, copulatory plugs formed by male semen hinder sequential mating of the female with a second male and diminish the reproductive outcome of the second male (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Mangels et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Sutter and Lindholm, 2016</xref>). Females, on the other hand, by removing the copulatory plug, can counteract male strategy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Koprowski, 1992</xref>). When fluid in female reproductive tract is spermicidal, male seminal fluid neutralises the spermicidal medium and secures sperm survival inside the female reproductive tract (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Holman and Snook, 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Among mammals, rodent species exhibit various sperm morphological and behavioural characteristics. A notable morphological feature of murine sperm is the apical hook resulting in an asymmetrical falciform head shape that are found in most of the murine rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Breed, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Roldan et al., 1992</xref>). The functional significance of the sperm hook that causes head asymmetry is still under debate in the field of mouse reproductive ecology. Currently, two main hypotheses attempt to explain the function of the sperm hook. One is that the sperm hook plays a crucial role in sperm competition by aiding sperm linkage (sperm train formation) that enhances straighter and faster sperm forward progression â the sperm cooperation hypothesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Fisher and Hoekstra, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Moore et al., 2002</xref>). The other hypothesis is that the sperm hook facilitates sperm-epithelium interactions in the female reproductive tract, playing a significant role in sperm migration â the migration hypothesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Smith and Yanagimachi, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Firman and Simmons, 2009</xref>). The sperm cooperation hypothesis is supported by the pioneering discovery of sperm linkage known as sperm trains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Moore et al., 2002</xref>) and suggests that sperm trains facilitate faster or straighter sperm swimming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Fisher and Hoekstra, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Moore et al., 2002</xref>). However, other studies could not find supporting evidence of sperm cooperation by the sperm train or morphological changes in sperm hooks concerning the degree of sperm competition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Firman and Simmons, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Hook et al., 2021</xref>). These researchers rather suggest that the sperm hook plays a crucial role in sperm migration by interacting with epithelia in the female reproductive tract.</p>
<p>Since thick muscle layers comprise the outer part of rodent female reproductive tract, direct observation of spermatozoa inside the female reproductive tract is a challenging feat. Therefore previous studies focused on the oviduct where muscle layers are thin and transparent, using brightfield, fluorescence or confocal microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Ishikawa et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Qu et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Suarez, 1987</xref>). In this study, we developed an ex-vivo observation system based on a custom-built two-photon microscope (Fig. S1). This system enables the observation of spermatozoa and their behaviour inside the live female reproductive tract. While two-photon microscopy is currently the method of choice for live imaging of deep tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Helmchen and Denk, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Benninger and Piston, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Keller, 2013</xref>), it has seldom been used for studying animal reproductive ecology.</p>
<p>Here, we demonstrate high-resolution deep-tissue imaging that allows us to observe and track sperm movement inside the female reproductive tract, including the uterus, to realise real-time tracking of spermatozoa and their migration.</p>
<p>Using this technology, we report newly discovered sperm behaviour and aggregation patterns that suggest various roles of the sperm hook in sperm migration inside the female reproductive tract. Based on live imaging of sperm dynamics inside the live female reproductive tract, we provide new observations and insights that suggest functions of the sperm hook that help sperm migration and cooperation. With our new observation system and results, we hope to contribute to the field of postcopulatory sexual selection in rodents by advancing methodological progress and stimulating discussion and future research on the function of sperm hook in murine rodents.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>To observe mouse sperm behaviour in the female reproductive tract, we mated wild-type <italic>Mus musculus</italic> (C57BL/6) females with transgenic male mice (Tables S1; S2) that express DsRed at the sperm mid-piece (mitochondria) and eGFP in the sperm acrosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Hasuwa et al., 2010</xref>). The female mice were euthanised between 0.5- and 3-hours post-mating, and their reproductive tract along with copulatory plug was excised and transferred to a sterilized Petri dish. We then conducted <italic>ex-vivo</italic> imaging of the live reproductive tract using our two-photon microscope (Fig. S1). <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref> is a diagram of the female reproductive tract that labels the name of each part of the tract. All observations were typically completed within 3 hours and did not exceed 6 hours post-euthanasia. Despite this observation period being longer than recommended for conventional rat transplantation surgery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">DÃ­az-GarcÃ­a et al., 2013</xref>), we noted live uterine movements throughout the entire observation period. When samples were transferred to incubators preheated to 37â with 5% CO<sub>2</sub> following observation, uterine movement persisted even 24 hours post-excision. We used Fiji (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Schindelin et al., 2012</xref>) and R 4.3.3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">R Core Team, 2024</xref>) for image processing and statistical analysis.</p>

(3) Sperm beating results in a change in sperm orientation (1 to 3â²: pro-wall-hook, 1 to 3â³: anti-wall-hook). The pro-wall-hook orientation coincides with sperm travelling along the wall and the anti-wall-hook orientation coincides with sperm moving away from the wall. (<bold>D</bold>) When spermatozoa reach the uterine wall, their trajectories predominantly follow the pro-wall-hook direction, where the sperm hook is directed towards the uterine wall. (<bold>E</bold>) The sperm hook assists a spermatozoon in anchoring to the epithelia (hook as an anchor). This anchoring facilitates sperm attachment to the uterine and UTJ epithelium and prevents spermatozoa from being swept away by internal flow caused by peristaltic movement. (<bold>F</bold>) The sperm hook and thin sperm head aid spermatozoa in squeezing through the sperm-crowded UTJ entrance (CT) and attaching to the epithelium by acting as an anchor (Movie S3). Note that in our experiments, we do not observe the principal and terminal pieces of spermatozoa due to a lack of fluorescence in our animal model. The observed acrosome and midpiece are shown coloured in the schematic figures.</p></caption>

<title>The role of sperm hook in migration inside the uterus</title>
<p>We first observed sperm movement in the uterus, where most ejaculated spermatozoa are located and initial sperm selection occurs. In the uterus, we observed vigorous fluid flow caused by uterine contraction and relaxation. Consequently, most spermatozoa in the uterus were carried by this flow, adhering to the inherent flow dynamics within the uterus (Movie S1A). However, when the flow temporarily ceased, spermatozoa located near the uterine wall exhibited greater activity (Movie S1B, C). When a spermatozoon encounters the uterine wall (epithelium) during migration, the sperm hook interacted with the wall and acts as a pivot (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Yu et al., 2023</xref>) that influences the direction of sperm travel (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>, C). Movie S2A shows two distinct types of sperm movement when transitioning from the uterus volume to the uterine wall: pro-wall-hook and anti-wall-hook directional movement (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). Upon reaching the uterine wall, instead of randomly deflecting in various directions, sperm preferentially altered their heading direction such that their apical hook would face the uterine wall (pro-wall-hook direction).</p>
<p>To test whether the hook influences the direction of migration, we tracked spermatozoa that travelled from the uterus volume to the wall in sequentially acquired images. We found that 52 out of 63 spermatozoa (82.54%) changed their migration direction towards the pro-wall-hook direction after reaching the uterine wall (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>). The remaining 11 spermatozoa followed the anti-wall-hook direction. A binomial test confirmed that this tendency was statistically significant (one-tailed, p &lt; .001, 95% CI: 0.73, 1.00). Furthermore, when spermatozoa migrated along the uterine wall, they exhibited a tapping-like behaviour in which spermatozoa tapped their hook against the epithelium when oriented in a pro-wall-hook direction (Movie S2B). In contrast, when the sperm hook faces the luminal space, spermatozoa could not migrate along the wall and their migration trajectories followed the anti-wall-hook direction, resulting in movement away from the wall (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>; Movie S2A). In addition to the advantage in straighter trajectories, fluid flows are slower at the wall than at the centre of the lumen in the uterus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Zaferani et al., 2019</xref>). Therefore migration along the uterine wall will help spermatozoa to reach the entrance of the intramural utero-tubal junction (UTJ), also called colliculus tubarius (CT), where one of the most important sperm selection processes takes place (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Nakanishi et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Qu et al., 2021</xref>).</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<title>Sperm anchoring and migration kinetics in the uterus</title>
<p>We observed that the sperm head was attaching to the epithelium of the CT and uterus (Movie S3A, B) when spermatozoa reached the CT. The sperm hook was affixed to the epithelium, thereby securing the spermatozoa on the epithelia. We defined this securing of the spermatozoa on the epithelia by the sperm hook as an anchor-like function of the hook (Movie S3A, B). This anchoring also helped prevent spermatozoa from being swept away by mucosal flow (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>; Movie S3B). When spermatozoa attached to the CT and squeezed through other spermatozoa by hooking, the apical hook always faced the epithelium (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>; Movie S3A). Once spermatozoa successfully clung onto the CT, anchoring to the epithelia prevented them from being pushed out by competing spermatozoa or from being swept away by fluid flow (Movie S3B).</p>
<p>To compare sperm migration kinetics during sperm swimming relative to their distance from the uterine wall, we tracked sperm migration trajectories by employing the TrackMate plugin in ImageJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Ershov et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Tinevez et al., 2017</xref>). After successful tracking using the customised tracking option in TrackMate, we computed various sperm kinetic parameters. These parameters included the curvilinear velocity (VCL), straight-line velocity (VSL), and linearity of forward progression (LIN), which are commonly used in computer-assisted sperm analysis, CASA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Amann and Waberski, 2014</xref>). Briefly, VCL was calculated as the total distance travelled divided by total travel time, VSL as the distance between initial and final positions of the sperm trajectory divided by total travel time, and LIN as the ratio of VSL to VCL, which can range from 0 to 100%, with 100% representing a perfectly straight line. We also introduced a new kinetic parameter called straight line-to-sideward movement ratio (SWR), defined as track displacement of a sperm trajectory divided by maximum sideward movement distance. Refer to Fig. S2A, B for our definition of the uterus wall and a schematic description of the sperm migration kinetic parameters, as well as Methods for more details.</p>
<p>Our sperm tracking analysis revealed that spermatozoa located close to the uterine wall moved faster, exhibiting higher VCL and VSL (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>; Table S3; Movie S1B, C). However, LIN and SWR did not significantly vary depending on spermâs distance from the uterus wall (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). In contrast to the non-significant changes in LIN and SWR relative to the distance from the uterine wall, when spermatozoa swam parallel to the wall, they not only moved faster (higher VCL and VSL; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>), but also followed a straighter path (higher LIN and SWR; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). Given that the internal fluid flow around the uterine wall is slower (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Zaferani et al., 2019</xref>), and considering the hydrodynamic factors that attract spermatozoa to the wall when swimming near it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Alvarez et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Elgeti et al., 2010</xref>), migration along the wall would be an efficient strategy for sperm movement within the uterus. We also examined the impact of both individual males (coded as âMale IDâ) and females (coded as âDateâ) on the sperm kinetic parameters in all models by visualising the effects of these two random variables (Fig. S3). We confirmed that the effects of the two random variables were consistent across all significant models, indicating validity of our model estimations.</p>

<title>Structure of UTJ and sperm behaviour at the entrance of intramural UTJ (CT)</title>
<p>Upon sacrificing and optical clearing the tissue, we confirmed that the entrance to the intramural UTJ (CT) in the uterus consists of nearly closed narrow gaps between mucosal folds (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). These narrow gaps extended to about 100 Âµm deeper from the entrance (Movie S4A, B), and only a few spermatozoa could pass through a gap at a time (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>; Movie S4C). We were not able to find evidence of passive sperm carriage, such as upsuck-like sperm carriage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Baker and Bellis, 1993</xref>), caused by peristaltic movement from the uterus into the UTJ in real-time live images (Movie S5A). Therefore, we concluded that fluid flow induced by uterine and oviduct contraction is not a major driving force for sperm entry to the UTJ through the CT.</p>

</fig>
<p>This conclusion raises a question about how spermatozoa enter the UTJ through the CT if the UTJ entrance is nearly closed. We found head-directional sliding of spermatozoa in the almost closed inter-luminal spaces between the uterus and intramural UTJ (Movie S5B). We did not observe any sliding of spermatozoa that directs to the tail-direction. This one-directional head-forward sliding in a very narrow inter-luminal space suggests a role of the sperm hook as an anchor that prevents backward slipping by the squeezing movement from the contraction of the uterus. Such one-directional sliding is also a plausible way of sperm migration from the uterus to UTJ through the narrow gap at the CT. We also observed that when muscle contraction and relaxation occurred at the uterus and oviduct, the surfaces of two confronting mucosal folds in intramural UTJ slid against each other in opposite directions (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>; Movie S5B). Such an opposite directional movement of mucosal folds, for example, will occur when the uterus bends to the left due to muscle contraction on its left side and relaxation of its right side (Fig. S4). As shown in Movie S5B, the opposite movement of mucosal folds makes space between mucosal folds at the CT, providing an opportunity for nearby attached spermatozoa to enter the intramural UTJ (Fig. S4). Although application of further experimental approaches will be necessary, occasional fluctuations in the size of the luminal space between mucosal folds, caused by peristaltic movements, together with the head-directional sliding of the spermatozoa, may provide an opportunity for spermatozoa to pass through the CT.</p>
<p>We also observed unidirectional sperm clustering as a result of spontaneous sperm re-arrangement during sperm beating along the uterine wall (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref> and Movie S6A, B). Such unidirectional sperm clustering and their successive beating resulted in synchronised sperm beating on some occasions (sperm self-organising behaviour). We also found such self-organised sperm behaviour on a large scale at the CT in which most of the clustered spermatozoa at the entrance of the intramural UTJ (CT) exhibited synchronised beating (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>; Movie S7). The synchronised sperm beating was observed to generate fluid flows strong enough to prevent other spermatozoa from attaching to the CT or directly push out other spermatozoa, thereby preventing other spermatozoa from entering the UTJ (Movie S6; S7).</p>

For the house mouse, the observed sperm trains did not move faster or slower than unlinked single spermatozoa (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>; Movie S8). Their VCL, VSL, and LIN were not faster nor higher than those of unlinked single spermatozoa as shown in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>.

<title>Sperm migration and accumulation in the oviduct</title>
<p>After entering the UTJ, spermatozoa continued migration through the narrow UTJ lumen. In the UTJ, spermatozoa interact with epithelia with their hook and penetrate their thin head into a narrow space (Movie S9A). Contraction of the UTJ reduced the width of the UTJ lumen and prevented sperm migration (Movie S9B). However, some spermatozoa could pass through the narrow luminal space by putting their thin hook (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>, B; Movie S9B). During UTJ lumen contraction, both swimming and beating of spermatozoa therein were physically suppressed.</p>

<graphic xlink:href="581047v3_fig6.tif" mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image"/>
</fig>
<p>When the UTJ lumen dilates, the suppressed spermatozoa started beating and swimming again (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>; Movie S9B). We also found sperm accumulations in the oviduct, including UTJ and isthmus (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D</xref>). However, as these sperm accumulations were arranged irregularly and consisted of spermatozoa that were mostly acrosome reacted and inactive, they were considered inactive entangled spermatozoa rather than active linked spermatozoa (or sperm trains). These entangled spermatozoa filled the narrow oviductal lumen, creating an obstruction for the migration of other spermatozoa (Movie S9C). If sperm hook facilitates such entanglement of inactive spermatozoa in the UTJ and isthmus, it can play a role in sperm competition by obstructing migration of the other spermatozoa including those from a second male.</p>
<p>Sperm beating rates of the epithelia-attached spermatozoa were observed to change over time according to the changes in widths of the UTJ lumen (Movie S10). Although such a change in beating rates may simply reflect luminal flow speed or luminal width related to physical space for beating, it may also assist in attaching spermatozoa to the epithelium by providing propulsive forces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Kantsler et al., 2014</xref>). Fluid flow in the UTJ and isthmus can damage unattached spermatozoa, particularly when they get entangled with inactive entangled spermatozoa that are moving back and forth by the flow (Movie S9C). If such beating prevents epithelium-attached spermatozoa being swept away by the flow, sperm beating corresponding to the fluid flow will be advantageous. The oviductal fluid gradually flows upward while continuously repeating back- and-forth directional changes and such flow is assumed to aid sperm migration from UTJ to ampulla (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Hino and Yanagimachi, 2019</xref>). However, given our observation of resistant (anchoring) behaviour of spermatozoa to the flow in the UTJ, passive sperm transfer may not always be beneficial for healthy spermatozoa. Additionally, such passive transfer can cause physical damage to the spermatozoa by the collision with other entangled spermatozoa or epithelia of the narrow lumen. Further experiments will be necessary to clarify the role of the rapid upward flow in the oviduct in the fertilization process in mice.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our real-time deep tissue imaging enabled by two-photon microscopy shows that the mouse sperm hook (i) facilitates sperm interaction with the epithelium for better navigation and (ii) provides an anchor-like role that assists attachment of sperm to the epithelium. These results suggest that the sperm hook in house mice functions to facilitate sperm migration by interacting with the female reproductive tract (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Firman and Simmons, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Suarez, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Tourmente et al., 2016</xref>). We also showed that when spermatozoa swim along the uterine wall, their apical hook interacts with the epithelia and determines sperm travelling direction upon encountering uterine epithelium. This finding implies that the sperm hook functions as a pivot when spermatozoa reach the uterine epithelium, and help spermatozoa migrate along the uterine wall by assisting in pro-wall-hook sperm orientation. Additionally, the sperm hook plays an important role in resisting endogenous fluid flow in the female reproductive tract by providing an anchor-like function. We did not observe linkage of spermatozoa (sperm trains) that enables faster and straighter swimming of the sperm train in the uterus or oviduct. Instead, we found instances of the entanglement of inactive spermatozoa in the oviduct. Such aggregates of inactive spermatozoa appear to obstruct the migration of other spermatozoa. However, the role that these entangled spermatozoa play in sperm competition within the oviduct is a subject that necessitates further investigation.</p>
<p>Previous studies using various murine rodents suggest that acquiring the ability to form sperm train is a relatively rare evolutionary events in this taxon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Tourmente et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Varea-SÃ¡nchez et al., 2016</xref>). Instead of finding evidence that the sperm hook aids in sperm train formation, those studies showed that variations in the length of the sperm hook, and asymmetry of sperm head influenced by the sperm hook are two important variables that reflect the degree of the sperm competition in murine rodents. One study even suggested that the sperm train formation (sperm linkage) is independent of the existence of sperm hook (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Tourmente et al., 2016</xref>). Therefore, it is questionable whether acquiring the sperm hook in the murine rodents has evolved in general for a better sperm linkage. In line with the previous studies, our current study also showed that sperm hook plays a pivotal role in sperm-epithelium interactions by aiding sperm attachment to the uterine and oviductal epithelium and influence sperm orientation during migration inside the female reproductive tract (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1E</xref>, F; Movie S3A, B). Such a role of the sperm hook suggests that the hook facilitates interactions between sperm and epithelia of the female reproductive tract and supports the migration hypothesis.</p>
<p>As we did not observe any passive sperm transfer by the internal fluid flow from the uterus to intramural UTJ through the CT, it is puzzling how spermatozoa enter the intramural UTJ. Although we proposed a hypothetical model of sperm passage through the CT in which the sperm hook plays an important role by providing an anchor-like role that prevents backward movement but allows head-forward sliding, further investigation with new experimental and observational tools will be necessary. Nevertheless, our findings suggest that the CT is a key female anatomical structure that controls sperm entry to the UTJ and influences sperm competition. If sperm passage through the CT is too easy, associated risks such as polyspermy or pathogen transmission that incur fitness costs for females also increase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Firman and Simmons, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Mahabir et al., 2008</xref>). Therefore, the number of sperm passing through the CT should be balanced by the conflict between the two sexes depending on species specific mating systems and the degree of promiscuity. This conflict then gives rise to an evolutionary arms race, with maleâs sperm fertilization ability on one side, which includes aspects such as sperm swimming speed, and the femaleâs sperm selection process on the other, which encompasses elements like physio-chemical barriers in the female reproductive tract (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Firman et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">LÃ¼pold and Pitnick, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Simmons and Wedell, 2020</xref>). Therefore, species variations in the length of the sperm hook and head asymmetry in rodents suggested in the previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Tourmente et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Varea-SÃ¡nchez et al., 2016</xref>) will also reflect the mechanical and structural characteristics of the CT and lumen in the intramural UTJ.</p>
<p>In the current study, we could not confirm evidence of sperm cooperation via sperm train formation that aids faster sperm swimming. Instead, we discovered a new form of potential sperm cooperation â synchronised sperm beating that resulted from spontaneous unidirectional sperm clustering. Based on these observations, we propose that the asymmetry of the mouse sperm head with apical hook plays a crucial role in synchronised sperm beating (sperm cooperation) by facilitating unidirectional sperm re-arrangement at the uterine wall. The asymmetrical head shape in the house mouse, therefore, may have evolved not only to facilitate sperm migration but also to facilitate such sperm self-organised behaviours including unidirectional clustering and following beating synchrony. Under this scenario, sperm cooperation in house mice is not only mediated by sperm train formation as in some rodent species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Fisher and Hoekstra, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Moore et al., 2002</xref>), but mediated by the synchronised sperm beating that obstruct migration of other spermatozoa in the uterus. Unidirectional sperm clustering and its potential role in sperm migration were also suggested in a previous study using fixed and tissue-cleared samples with in-vitro live sperm analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Qu et al., 2021</xref>). We could not find any supporting evidence that such clustering helps sperm passage through the CT. However, our observations regarding self-organised sperm behaviour provides insights into the evolution of the asymmetrical structure of the sperm head in rodent species. These findings present an opportunity to reconcile two hypotheses: the cooperation hypothesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Fisher and Hoekstra, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Immler et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Moore et al., 2002</xref>) and the migration hypothesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Firman and Simmons, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Smith and Yanagimachi, 1990</xref>).</p>
<p>The evolution of sperm characteristics, including the sperm hook, is a complex process influenced by several factors. For instance, sperm competition between ejaculates is a significant driving forces influencing sperm head morphology and behaviour in rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Fisher et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Immler et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Tourmente et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Varea-SÃ¡nchez et al., 2016</xref>). Cryptic female choice also plays a crucial role in the evolution of sperm head shape and sperm kinetic characteristics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Birkhead, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Eberhard and Lehmann, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Firman et al., 2017</xref>). Further investigation of sperm behaviour inside the female reproductive tract or tissue mimicking microfluidic devices with real-time deep tissue imaging as in the current study, will provide valuable opportunities for a more comprehensive examination of both sperm-sperm and sperm-epithelium interactions in the female reproductive tract. While we have focused on observing sperm interactions for only natural healthy mice in this study, future works employing specifically targeted genetically modified knockout animal models will further elucidate and confirm the exact genetic and functional mechanisms that guide these interactions. This will help us better understand not only sperm competition and cryptic female choice in mice, but also those in other animals, including humans. While current assessments of sperm health generally involve measuring sperm count, movement, and shape, the current study suggests that analysing interactions between spermatozoa and the female reproductive tract is important and warrants further exploration.</p>
<p>Given the significance of sperm health for fertility, this work not only highlights the importance of interactions between male sperm and female reproductive tract in successful migration, but also opens new avenues for understanding different causes of infertility and possible targets for treatment.</p>

<p>To observe sperm behaviour in the female mouse reproductive organ, we built a video rate (30 frames/second at 512 x 512 pixel resolution) Two-Photon Laser Scanning Fluorescence Microscope (2PLSM; Fig. S1). A tunable femtosecond pulse laser (Chameleon, Discovery) was tuned to a choice of wavelengths from 960, 970, 980 and 1000 nm to simultaneously excite GFP and Ds-Red for sperm imaging and for autofluorescence imaging of the reproductive tract.</p>

<title>Mice preparation and mating</title>
<p>We used two male transgenic mice lines for mating experiments. We purchased B6D2-Tg(CAG/Su9-DsRed2, Acr3-EGFP)RBGS002Osb male mice that express DsRed in the mitochondria at sperm midpiece and EGFP in the sperm acrosome from Riken BRC, Japan, depositor: M. Ikawa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Hasuwa et al., 2010</xref>). We then conducted in vitro fertilization to produce specific pathogen-free (SPF) F1 mice. The fertilized eggs (2-cell stage embryos) were then artificially inseminated into SPF wild-type C57BL/6J females. After we confirmed successful production of transgenic F1 male mice by PCR, we confirmed the SPF status and formed two breeding colonies with the transgenic F1 males under the SPF condition. One breeding colony comprised two wild-type C57BL/6J females to better reproduce F2 generation. We also made breeding colonies that consisted of a transgenic C57BL/6J female, Cx3cr1tm2.1(cre/ERT2)Litt/WganJ (JAX stock #021160, Cx3cr1 female) that expresses EYFP in microglia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Parkhurst et al., 2013</xref>) to test whether sperm functionality changes in other mice including double-transgenic mice. When F2 mice got older than 6 weeks, they were transferred to another room where mating experiments were conducted. After transfer, each male mouse for mating experiments was single-caged. We used the F2 males that derived from both colonies that had the two genes (CAG/Su9-DsRed2 and Acr3-EGFP; RBGS male) or three genes (CAG/Su9-DsRed2, Acr3-EGFP, and Cx3cr1; RBGS-Cx3cr1 male) for mating experiments. We could not find any phenotypic difference in the sperm of the two strains â sperm from both strains expressed red fluorescence at the midpiece and green fluorescence at the acrosome at the head.</p>
<p>We confirmed that both strains of F2 males were fertile, and their sperm also successfully migrated through the female reproductive tract, from the uterus to the ampulla.</p>
<p>In total, we used 3 males that successfully mated with females due to space limits in the experimental room (Table S1). The 3 males were used repeatedly for all mating experiments in the current study except one vasectomized RBGS-Cx3cr1 male that was used only once for comparison of the CT structure for virgin and non-virgin female mice (Table S2). All mice were kept under a housing condition that allows free access to food and water with 12 hours of light and dark cycle (lighting from 6 to 18 oâclock, dark from 18 to 6 oâclock). Mating experiments were done under light conditions from 9 am to 12 pm for three hours. Oestrus was induced by exposing male bedding materials (wood shavings) that consisted of male excretion to females older than 8 weeks. Three to seven days after exposure to the bedding materials, oestrus was checked daily following previously established protocols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Byers et al., 2012</xref>). When we found oestrous females, we relocated one or two females to a single-caged male. When males showed no interest in the female (no mounting attempts) or the female rejected the maleâs mounting attempt for the first 10 minutes, we returned the female to its original cage. The returned females were not exposed to other males until the next mating trial on the next day or one week later. All females in the experiments had no birth records before successful copulatory plug-confirmed mating. However, some of them probably had multiple oestrous cycles given our multiple oestrus-inducing trials. We did not limit the age of females and males for our experiments to minimize the number of sacrificed animals. We observed the maleâs mating until we could observe ejaculation. To confirm male ejaculation, we checked the copulatory plug from the female genitalia after we observed ejaculatory behaviour â the male stops thrusting and holds the female for about 5 to 10 seconds when it ejaculates. After this ejaculatory behaviour, we waited for 2 minutes and if the male did not exhibit further mounting, we checked the copulatory plug from the female genitalia. When the male ejaculated, we kept them together for up to 3 hours then took out the female for imaging experiments.</p>

After attachment, we filled the dish with 37â preheated medium that contained an equal amount of DMEM and modified human tubal fluid (mHTF; Fujifilm Irvine Scientific, cat. ID. 90126) medium. All media were stored for at least 1 hour in a 37â preheated incubator with 5% of CO<sub>2</sub> concentration before use. The culture dish was then placed on the 37â preheated metal mount of the two-photon microscope and imaged with varying laser power for different depths.

<p>Multicolour imaging was performed where each frame of the image has two colour channels (red and green). If needed, we could increase the frame rate up to 110 fps or higher by reducing the acquired image size to 128 x 128 (16,384 pixels per frame). We conducted observation for about 3 to 6 hours. During our observation, the uterus continued contraction and relaxation cycles.</p>
<p>To image the entire depth of the reproductive tract, we applied tissue clearing to investigate the structure of the UTJ entrance (or colliculus tubarius, CT) using the C-Match solution (RI = 1.46, Crayon technologies, Korea). In brief, the tissue was first washed 3 times in PBS and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 3 hours at 4â in a refrigerator. After fixation, we washed the tissue 3 times with PBS and the absorbed residual PBS using paper towels. We then added C-Match to the sample and waited overnight and imaged it on the next day with the sample submerged in C-Match. We imaged three cleared samples from three different females. In one sample (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>), only the intramural UTJ part was excised from one unmated transgenic C57BL/6J female mouse â a hybrid female that was delivered from Cx3cr1 female and Thy1 male (JAX stock #030526) called Tg(Thy1-jRGECO1a)GP8.31Dkim (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Dana et al., 2018</xref>). Another sample was from a female that was mated with a vasectomized RBGS-Cx3cr1 male. In this sample, the whole female reproductive tract was excised with the copulatory plug, so the intramural UTJ was covered by the uterus. This sample was used to compare the UTJ for virgin and non-virgin females. The final sample was from a wild-type female that was mated with an RBGS-Cx3cr1 male. For cleared tissue imaging, we acquired 3D volume images with 2 um Z-axis step size while averaging 20 (first sample) or 30 images (second sample) per slice to increase the signal to noise ratio using autofluorescence of the reproductive tract tissue.</p>

<title>Sperm tracking and speed measurement</title>
<p>We used Fiji (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Schindelin et al., 2012</xref>) to process acquired images and its plugin, called TrackMate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Ershov et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Tinevez et al., 2017</xref>) to track sperm trajectory in the uterus. We extracted trajectories from 60 sequential images (duration 2 seconds) for sperm tracking when uterus movement was the smallest. We also used Turboreg (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Thevenaz et al., 1998</xref>), an ImageJ plugin, to realign the images when there was a shift between images due to uterine movement. Additionally, out of eight stacked images, we cropped three to obtain a straight view of the uterine wall. After preparing the images, we targeted the sperm head to track sperm as the sperm head expressed EGFP which was easy to track. We used Thresholding Detector to select sperm heads and LAP Tracker to trace sperm trajectories using the TrackMate plugin. We also adjusted parameter values in the plugin to better select sperm trajectories. Our final parameter values are as follows: head radius (&gt; 0.75 Âµm), frame-to-frame linking (10 â¼ 11 Âµm), track segment gap closing (max distance: 10 â¼ 11 Âµm, max frame gap: 2), number of spots in track (&gt; 6), and max distance travel (2.5 Âµm). When there were artificial trajectories that were not from sperm, we manually removed the track. If the original parameters could not detect well or had too many false tracks, we adjusted two parameters; frame-to-frame linking (up to 12 Âµm), and track segment gap closing (only max distance up to 12 Âµm). We also tracked the trajectories of sperm trains using the same parameters and settings. However, to reduce computation time and prevent mis-tracking of non-sperm cells, we cropped the images and utilized 100x100 pixel images that contain the entire trajectory of each sperm train as well as other unlinked single spermatozoa.</p>
<p>To calculate sperm speed in relation to the distance from the uterine wall, we need to define the uterine wall. To define the uterine wall, we first selected images with straighter uterine wall and projected the extracted 60 sequential images into one plane by taking the maximum intensity projection with some adjustment of brightness and contrast using Fiji. For some images taken at a low magnification level that contained curved uterine walls, we used parts of the field of view that contained straight walls appropriate for our analysis. Next, we used the object selection tool of Adobe Photoshop CC (23.1.0 version) to automatically select the walls from the projected images. We then extracted the uterine wall image layer and pasted it to a blank image with white background. Finally, we extracted the wall coordinates by selecting the non-zero-valued pixels that formed the boundary of the uterine wall (blue coloured area in Fig. S2A). The boundary coordinates were converted to a micrometre scale based on the magnification and image resolution to normalize the units between different images obtained with different magnification factors. We fitted the uterine wall coordinates using linear regression. The fitted linear regression line was considered the uterine wall of each female (â  in Fig. S2B) and used to calculate the distance and angle (radian) between sperm and the wall.</p>
<p>We measured the distance between sperm and the uterine wall by calculating the minimum distance between the mid-point of each sperm trajectory and the fitted line of the uterine wall (â¡ in Fig. S2B). The angle between a sperm trajectory and the uterine wall was calculated by measuring the angle between the fitted line and a straight line that passed the first and last spots of the trajectory (â¢ in Fig. S2B). We then computed sperm progression speed parameters used in CASA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Amann and Waberski, 2014</xref>) using our sperm tracking data using the TrackMate plug-in. We first calculated curvilinear velocity, VCL by dividing the total distance travelled (Âµm) by total track time â the time (second) taken from the first point (spot) to the last point in a sperm trajectory. The straight line velocity, VSL was calculated by dividing the track displacement â the distance between the first and last spots of a sperm trajectory â by the total track time (second). We also calculated the linearity of forward progression, LIN of sperm by dividing VSL by VCL (range 0 to 1). Along with the above CASA-used parameters, we defined a new parameter, the straight line-to-sideward movement ratio (SWR) to estimate sperm migration linearity by comparing forward and sideward moving distances. SWR was calculated by dividing the track displacement (Âµm) of a sperm trajectory by the maximum sideward movement distance (Âµm) â the maximum distance between two parallel lines passing each point (spot) that parallel to the track displacement line (â£ in Fig. S2B). Further information on the terms and parameters of the TrackMate plug-in used in the current paper is also described in a paper and manual by the developers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Ershov et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Tinevez et al., 2017</xref>).</p>

<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>All statistical analyses were done using R, version 4.3.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">R Core Team, 2023</xref>). To estimate sperm swimming speed and linearity in relation to the uterine wall, we used data from 8 copulation experiments between 8 females and 3 males. We ran 4 generalized linear mixed models to test whether sperm move faster and straighter when they migrate along the uterine wall. We used log-transformed VCL, VSL, LIN, and SWR as response variables in each model. In all models, we included the angle and distance between the wall and sperm trajectories as explanatory variables. We also included whether we cropped the image or not (O or X) to check the effect of image cropping on the analysis. Male IDs and the date of experiments were included as random effects in all models to control possible individual variations in sperm and reproductive tract properties. All models did not violate assumptions. All full models were also compared with null models that only included random effect and all full models were significantly better than the null models. All variance influencing factors (VIFs) were less than 1.1 which indicates no serious drawback from collinearity.</p>

<p>This study uses ex vivo live imaging of uteri post-mating to test the role of the sperm hook in the house mouse sperm in sperm movement that would be interesting to evolutionary biologists. The significance of the work is <bold>useful</bold> as live imaging can reveal information not seen in fixed images. The strength of evidence is <bold>incomplete</bold> as they cannot directly test the role of the sperm hook in facilitating movement along the uterine wall.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors want to determine the role of the sperm hook of the house mouse sperm in movement through the uterus. They use transgenic lines with fluorescent labels to sperm proteins, and they cross these males to C57BL/6 females in pathogen-free conditions. They use 2-photon microscopy on ex vivo uteri within 3 hours of mating and the appearance of a copulation plug. There are a total of 10 post-mating uteri that were imaged with 3 different males. They provide 10 supplementary movies that form that basis for some of the quantitative analysis in the main body figures. Their data suggest that the role of the sperm hook is to facilitate movement along the uterine wall.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Ex vivo live imaging of fluorescently labeled sperm with 2-photon microscopy is a powerful tool for studying the behavior of sperm.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The paper is descriptive and the data are correlations.</p>
<p>The authors cannot directly test their proposed function of the sperm hook in sliding and preventing backward slipping.</p>

<p>The following is the authorsâ response to the previous reviews.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Public Reviews:</bold></p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors want to determine the role of the sperm hook of the house mouse sperm in movement through the uterus. They use transgenic lines with fluorescent labels to sperm proteins, and they cross these males to C57BL/6 females in pathogen-free conditions. They use 2-photon microscopy on ex vivo uteri within 3 hours of mating and the appearance of a copulation plug. There are a total of 10 post-mating uteri that were imaged with 3 different males. They provide 10 supplementary movies that form the basis for some of the quantitative analysis in the main body figures. Their data suggest that the role of the sperm hook is to facilitate movement along the uterine wall.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Ex vivo live imaging of fluorescently labeled sperm with 2-photon microscopy is a powerful tool for studying the behavior of sperm.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The paper is descriptive and the data are correlations.</p>
<p>The authors cannot directly test their proposed function of the sperm hook in sliding and preventing backward slipping.</p>
<p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>I suggest that the authors clearly state and explain in the manuscript that this study is limited with respect to the ability to &quot;directly test the role of the sperm hook in facilitating movement along the uterine wall&quot;. I think that if they make this statement in the manuscript, perhaps at the end of the abstract, then the strength of evidence for their claims could be deemed as solid after re-review.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer again for the review process. We believe that our manuscript has improved considerably during the review process. Regarding the limitations and future work, we have added the following to the discussion section.</p>
<p>âFurther investigation of sperm behaviour inside the female reproductive tract or tissue mimicking microfluidic devices with real-time deep tissue imaging as in the current study, will provide valuable opportunities for a more comprehensive examination of both sperm-sperm and sperm-epithelium interactions in the female reproductive tract. While we have focused on observing sperm interactions for only natural healthy mice in this study, future works employing specifically targeted genetically modified knockout animal models will further elucidate and confirm the exact genetic and functional mechanisms that guide these interactions.â</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The revised manuscript is an improvement over the initial submission. I suggest that the authors mark the oviduct explicitly in Fig. 1A.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The oviduct includes the ampulla, isthmus, and UTJ. We have additionally marked the oviduct in Fig. 1A, with according arrows and a box.</p>
