<title>Abstract</title><p>Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a pathological condition affecting individuals worldwide. Patients with NAFLD are more susceptible to systemic inflammation, such as sepsis, which accelerates liver damage. However, the immunological mechanisms that trigger the hyper-inflammatory responses in individuals with NAFLD remain unknown. In the present study, we reported that short-term HFCD (Choline Deficient High Fat Diet)-fed mice, which did not show significative signs of hepatic damage and inflammation in the first two weeks, are more susceptible to mortality after lipopolysaccharide (LPS) challenge. Mechanistically, endotoxemic mice show an excessive accumulation of NK-producing IFN-γ cells in liver tissue triggering the recruitment and polarization of a distinct neutrophil subset, characterized by high PD-L1 expression and massive TNFα production. Remarkably, genetic inhibition of IFN-γ or pharmacological blockade of PD-L1 effectively modulated the excessive recruitment of these neutrophils to the liver and TNFα release, thereby preventing hepatic damage and reducing the severity of host mortality. Thus, these results support the design of novel effective strategies to control hyperinflammatory responses in patients with HFCDs and consequently prevent hepatic damage and mortality..</p>

<label>1.</label><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a metabolic hepatic dysfunction defined as an abnormal accumulation of fat within the liver without secondary triggers such as alcohol consumption. NAFLD has become a common chronic liver disease in the world population and has a high prevalence varying from simple steatosis to non- alcoholic steatohepatitis, fibrosis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>). Despite its high prevalence and increasing cause of liver-related mortality worldwide, NAFLD is still underestimated, and there are no approved pharmacological or preventive strategies for these medical conditions(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>).</p>
<p>The NAFLD is highly complex and involves a “multi-hit” process in which different stimuli act together to promote fat accumulation and progressive liver damage(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>). Although the pathogenesis of NAFLD is multifactorial, inflammation has now been considered a key factor in the progression of advanced hepatic conditions(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>). In the presence of obesity and lipotoxicity, the immune system is activated in the liver, with a corresponding degree of inflammation triggered by the “wound healing response”. Since these inflammatory signs persist for a long period, monocytes and neutrophils, as well as T CD4, T CD8, and natural killer (NK), can be recruited to the liver, releasing a massive quantity of pro-inflammatory cytokines, mainly interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) and tumor necrosis factor (TNFα)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>). Likewise in autoimmune diseases, these cytokines are also present in systemic and uncontrolled inflammatory processes, such as sepsis(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>). Sepsis is a syndrome characterized by a life-threatening dysfunction due to complex interactions between pathogens and the host recruitment of immune cells, resulting in a systemic hyper-inflammatory state followed by extensive vital organ damage, including in the liver(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>). Sepsis has also been considered the leading cause of death in intensive care units. In endotoxemia, rodents develop a sepsis-like inflammatory response, characterized by a massive production of cytokines that provokes uncontrolled recruitment of innate immune cells, mainly monocytes, and neutrophils to vital organs, such as the liver, inducing extensive and lethal damage(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>). The majority of data regarding endotoxemia pathogenesis have focused only on the interaction between the infection and the host immune system, and only a few studies have addressed one or more clinical conditions that are considered risk factors leading to endotoxemia aggravation, such as senescence and previous immunosuppressive comorbidities(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>). Thus, understanding how these clinical conditions can modify the host immune response and consequently affect the outcome of sepsis is crucial to detecting the risks and designing novel preventive and therapeutic approaches to control exacerbated inflammatory responses. Recently, some populational studies, including large-scale data from cohorts with biopsy-confirmed individuals, have evidenced a higher incidence of severe infections in NAFLD patients, suggesting that previous hepatic conditions can modify the host immune response, leading to sepsis aggravation(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>). However, although a relationship between elevated risk of sepsis in NAFLD patients exists, the underlying immunological mechanisms involved in the progression and exacerbation of systemic and local (hepatic) inflammation in these individuals have not been identified yet.</p>
<p>To understand the impact of NAFLD on liver damage during endotoxemia, we used a known murine model of NAFLD and later challenged these animals with a moderate dose of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). We demonstrated that endotoxemia exacerbated the hepatic inflammatory response and mortality in HFCD-fed mice. The LPS-activated hepatic NK cells secrete IFN-γ, which induces massive recruitment and polarization of a specific subpopulation of neutrophils expressing PD-L1. This subpopulation of neutrophils releases a high concentration of TNF-α, which mediates the liver lesion and increases the mortality of the animals. Biological treatments promoting PD-L1 neutralization, or neutrophil depletion, reduced the TNFα concentration and improved the liver inflammatory response, organ pathology, and survival in endotoxemic HFCD-fed mice. Similar results were observed with the use of genetic knockout TNF-α receptor mice. Thus, our findings describe the potential mechanism involved in the exacerbation of neutrophil activity in NAFLD mice and suggest biological interventions as a viable pharmacological approach to abolish the hyper-inflammatory response observed in pathological hepatic conditions</p>

<title>NAFLD mice are more susceptible to LPS-induced systemic inflammation</title>
<p>To study NAFLD as a pre-condition associated with increasing risk of exacerbation of inflammation induced by endotoxemia, we employed a murine model NAFLD in which the mice were fed for two weeks with a choline-deficient high-fat HFCD diet, a well-known liver disease model (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>). The protocol was modified due to the observation that lymphocytes decreased in number over the weeks of the eight- week HFCD diet. As a result, we used a two-week diet period during which no changes in lymphocyte numbers were observed because the HFCD diet, which is choline- deficient, leads to a reduction in lymphocyte numbers in the animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>). The HFCD mice challenged with LPS (10 mg/kg; intraperitoneally triggered an elevated susceptibility with an index of mortality of 100% 24 h after the challenge (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref>). In our experimental condition, this dose of LPS provoked moderate (below 40%, 4 days after LPS challenge) mortality in chow-fed mice (control group), (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref>). Compared with the control group the HFCD animals challenged with LPS showed elevated liver damage evidenced by an increase of plasmatic alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels (a known marker of liver injury) and histopathological alteration, characterized by leukocyte infiltration and edema (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1C</xref>,<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1E</xref>). Compared with control mice treated with PBS, the HFCD animals also treated with PBS did not show significative signs of hepatic damage and local inflammatory response, evidenced by the absence of leukocyte infiltration (Fig1C and 1E). Remarkably, compared with the Chow group, HFCD mice exposed to LPS did not exhibit higher kidney injuries (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>), indicating a pathological inflammatory condition is increased mainly in liver tissue compared to other organs. To assess how NAFLD modulates the immune response in the hepatic microenvironment of human patients, we reanalyzed previously published bulk RNA-seq data from patients with NAFLD to identify potential targets related to the inflammatory process(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>). Firstly, we performed analyses of genes differentially expressed in leukocyte samples from patients with NAFLD and healthy controls. We observed that 5240 genes are upregulated, such as <italic>EIF4H</italic>, <italic>TMEM</italic>, <italic>MOB1A</italic>, <italic>SERBP1</italic>, <italic>TM9SF1</italic>, <italic>HINT3</italic>, <italic>ARF3</italic>, <italic>CHTF8</italic>, and <italic>PDIA6</italic>, while 5806 genes, as <italic>FOSB</italic>, <italic>KAT2A</italic>, <italic>SNRNP70</italic>, <italic>CCNL2</italic>, <italic>AMY2B</italic>, <italic>EXD3</italic>, and <italic>EBNA1BP2, are</italic> downregulated. Interestingly, the <italic>CD274</italic> gene (encoding PD-L1) and the <italic>IFNGR2</italic> gene, corresponding to the IFN-γ receptor, are among the upregulated genes (Fig2A).</p>

<p>Furthermore, after conducting an additional enrichment analysis of the 5240 upregulated genes using Gene Ontology (GO), we detected an increase in several pathways associated with an inflammatory process, such as phagocytosis, leukocyte migration, immune response to bacterial components, and IL1β, TNFα, and IFN-γ-referred signaling (Fig2B).</p>
<p>Because IFN-γ and TNF-α signaling pathways are upregulated in NAFLD patients, we reanalyzed previously published single-cell RNA-seq data from liver samples from mice fed with a 60% high-fat diet, another known NAFLD model(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>). We noted an increase in immune cells in the hepatic tissue, such as monocytes, neutrophils, dendritic cells, T cells, and NK cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2C</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2D</xref>). Interestingly, we observed a specific upregulation of CD274 and TNFα genes in monocytes and neutrophils, while T cells and NK cells showed increased IFN-γ expression in T and NK cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2E</xref>), suggesting that the cytokines produced by these specific cells may be involved in the hyperinflammation observed during NAFLD.</p>

<p>Next, based on the results of increased IFN-γ and TNF-α signaling in bulk RNAseq and single-cell RNA sequencing analyses in hepatic samples of NAFLD patients and animals, we investigated the role of these cytokines in the susceptibility of endotoxemic NAFLD mice. Initially, we observed an exacerbated hepatic production of both cytokines induced by endotoxin challenge in the HFCD-fed group compared to the control mice treated with PBS or LPS (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3A</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3B</xref>). Furthermore, we also observed that IFN-γ<sup>-/-</sup> and TNFR1R2α<sup>-/-</sup> mice with NAFLD challenged with LPS did not show an increase of the enzyme ALT, a liver lesions marker (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3C</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3D</xref>). In addition, endotoxemic NAFLD TNFR1R2<sup>-/-</sup> and IFN-γ<sup>-/-</sup> mice exhibited reduced leukocyte infiltration in the liver tissue and improved survival (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3E, 3F</xref>, and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3G</xref>), respectively, as compared to endotoxemic WT mice. Together, our data demonstrate that NAFLD predisposes to the exacerbation of cytokines production, such as IFN-γ and TNF, which mediate an elevated mortality index in endotoxemic mice.</p>

<title>NAFLD induces the recruitment of NK cells that are sources of IFN-γ production in endotoxemia</title>
<p>During the inflammatory process, it is already established that CD4 and CD8 T cells are important sources of IFN-γ(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>). Herein, we observed a selective increase in IFN-γ production by CD8, but not CD4, T cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4A</xref>, Fig4B, S1B, S1A), respectively. In light of this, we next investigated the involvement of lymphoid cells in the high susceptibility of endotoxemic mice with NAFLD. For this, we submitted animals with the absence of T and B cells (<italic>Rag1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice) to NAFLD protocol. After challenging them with LPS,the survival rate was assessed. Interestingly, <italic>Rag1</italic>-deficient animals under the HFCD diet remained susceptible to the LPS challenge (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4C</xref>), suggesting that these T and B cells do not contribute to susceptibility to the LPS challenge.</p>

<p>Recent studies have demonstrated that NK cells are other IFN-γ-producing cells recruited to the hepatic tissue during NAFLD and that they are also involved in systemic inflammatory responses, including sepsis(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>). We observed that the number of NK cells is increased in the hepatic tissue of NAFLD animals, compared with mice fed with a control chow diet. The challenge with LPS enhanced the NK accumulation in liver tissue only in NAFLD mice (FigS1C and 4D). Furthermore, our cytometric analyses demonstrated that NK cells infiltrated in the liver tissue secrete high levels of IFN-γ (FigS1D and 4E). Next, to confirm the pathological involvement of NK cells during hyperinflammation in NAFLD, we depleted these cells by treating animals with anti-NK antibody 1.1, one day before the LPS challenge (FigS2). Interestingly, the pharmacological depletion of NK cells in NAFLD animals provoked an increased survival index (Fig4F). Furthermore, when NK cells were depleted, NAFLD animals exhibited reduced hepatic damage (Fig4G), IFN-γ levels (Fig4H), and TNFα levels (Fig4I). Together, these results suggest that NK cells are responsible for an increase in the mortality via IFN-γ production in NAFLD during endotoxemia.</p>

<title>Neutrophils are responsible for susceptibility during hyperinflammation in NAFLD</title>
<p>During NAFLD development, innate immune cells, such as monocytes and neutrophils, are the first leukocytes recruited to the liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>). With this in mind, mice with NAFLD were challenged with LPS, and the infiltration of these cells in the liver was quantified. During the initial inflammatory phase, six hours after the LPS challenge, we observed that monocytes were recruited to the site (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5A</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5B</xref>). Since inflammatory monocytes emigrate from the bone marrow towards the periphery via CCR2 and then migrate to inflamed tissues, differentiating into monocytes-derived macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>), we investigated the functional role of monocytes in NAFLD, using CCR2-deficient mice (Fig3S). Interestingly, animals deficient in monocyte migration (CCR2-/-) showed a high mortality rate, compared with wild type after LPS challenge (Fig3SA and 3SB). Furthermore, the survival rate of NAFLD CCR2-/- mice challenged with LPS was not different of NAFLD wild-type mice also challenged with LPS (Fig 3SB). Together, the results suggest that monocytes do not contribute to susceptibility in endotoxemic animals with NAFLD In addition to monocytes, granulocytes are innate immune cells recruited to the hepatic tissue during the development of NAFLD(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>). We observed that high levels of neutrophils are present in the hepatic tissue of animals with NAFLD and that their recruitment is exacerbated in the hepatic microenvironment in endotoxemic mice (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5A</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5C</xref>). It is known that neutrophils are recruited to the inflammatory focus via CXCR2(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>). To understand the involvement of these receptors and neutrophils in NAFLD during endotoxemia, NAFLD animals were pre-treated one day before the LPS challenge with CXCR2i or with anti-Ly6G, which depletes these cells throughout the organism. Interestingly, after both treatments, we observed a reduction of the leukocyte infiltration into the hepatic tissue (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5D</xref>) and a decrease in hepatic lesions (ALT) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5E</xref>) and TNFα levels (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5F</xref>). Confirming the participation of granulocytes in susceptibility after the LPS challenge in NAFLD, animals treated with CXCR2i and anti-Ly6G showed an improvement in their survival (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5G</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5H</xref>).</p>

<title>IFN-γ induces CD274 expression during endotoxemia in animals with NAFLD</title>
<p>IFN-γ is a cytokine that plays a crucial role in the T and NK cell-mediated immune response(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>). Recent studies have shown that this inflammatory cytokine also induces the expression of checkpoint molecules, such as programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) in different immune cells, including neutrophils(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>). Analyzing datasets from mice with NAFLD, we observed the upregulation of the CD274 (PD-L1) gene and TNF-α in neutrophils and IFN-γ in NK cells (Fig1C, Fig1D, and Fig1E). Considering these findings, we investigated whether IFN-γ induces the expression of PD-L1 in neutrophils in NAFLD mice during endotoxemia. First, we observed that only the NAFLD diet provoked a significant increase in the PD-L1 expression in the hepatic neutrophils (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6A</xref>). When challenged with LPS, these HFCD-fed mice show an exacerbated migration of PD-L1+ neutrophils toward the liver (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6B</xref>). Next, to confirm the role of IFN-γ in the expression of PD-L1, we investigated whether IFN-γ enhances the expression of PD-L1 in neutrophils after the LPS challenge of NAFLD. Mice with NAFLD lacking IFN-γ were challenged with LPS and assessed for PD-L1 expression in granulocytes. Interestingly, in the absence of IFN-γ, neutrophils do not express PD-L1, and their infiltration in the liver was attenuated (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6C</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6D</xref>).</p>

<p>As demonstrated previously in sepsis, PD-L1 neutrophils showed reduced rates of apoptosis(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>). Therefore, we cultured neutrophils in the presence of IFN-γ and LPS and assessed their apoptosis rate. Interestingly, in these <italic>in vitro</italic> conditions, neutrophils expressing PD-L1 showed reduced rates of apoptosis (Fig6E and 6F), suggesting that PD-L1-expressing neutrophils can survive for long periods in the hepatic environment in NAFLD accentuating the LPS-induced inflammatory response.</p>

<title>Neutrophils expressing PD-L1+ secrete TNFα during hyperinflammation in NAFLD</title>
<p>There is also evidence that excessive secretion of TNF-α by immune cells, especially neutrophils, may be associated with liver damage and the progression of NAFLD(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>). To investigate a possible link between the expression of PD-L1 by the neutrophils and their ability to express TNF-α, mice undergoing NAFLD were exposed to LPS, and the expression of TNF-α by PD-L1+ neutrophils was assessed. We observed an exacerbated TNF-α expression by PD-L1+ neutrophils from NAFLD compared to control chow animals (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig 7A</xref>, <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig 7B</xref>, and <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig 7D</xref>). These results illustrate that after exposure of NAFLD animals with LPS, the expression of PD-L1 by neutrophils is linked to heightened TNF-α expression compared to control animals fed standard chow. To assess whether the lack of TNFα signaling immunomodulates the granulocytic recruitment to the liver tissues in NAFLD animals, TNF receptor R1 and R2 knockout animals (TNF R1R2) were exposed to LPS. It was also observed that the absence of TNFα did not interfere with the recruitment of neutrophils to the liver tissue (FigS5A and FigS5C) or the expression of PD-L1 in neutrophils (FigS5B and FigS5D). Similarly, the absence of TNF-α receptors in NAFLD during the challenge with LPS did not interfere with the production of IL-10 and IFN-γ (FigS5E and FigS5G). However, as described above, the absence of the TNF R1R2 receptor reduced liver injury and the mortality induced by LPS administration in NAFLD (Fig3D and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3F</xref>). Considering that NK cells in the liver tissue secrete IFN-γ (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4E</xref>), we next examined whether PD-L1+TNFα+ neutrophils are present in NAFLD animals depleted of NK cells. It was observed that in the absence of NK cells, PD-L1+TNFα+ neutrophils were not detected (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig 7E</xref>, <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig 7F</xref>, and <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig 7G</xref>), confirming that IFN-γ secreted by NK cells is crucial for inducing PD-L1 expression and TNFα secretion by neutrophils in the hepatic tissue in NAFLD animals after LPS administration.</p>

<title>Anti-PD-L1 treatment protects animals with NAFLD during hyperinflammation</title>
<p>Next, we investigated the potential role of PD-L1 in TNF-α production by neutrophils and in the lesions in NAFLD mice. We found that anti-PD-L1, a biological drug inhibiting PD-L1’s interaction with PD-1, effectively prevented liver inflammation and tissue damage (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig 8A</xref>, Fig8B, and Fig8F). Additionally, this treatment reduced liver TNFα levels without affecting IFN-γ (Fig8C) and improved host survival (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8D</xref>). Importantly, anti-PD-L1 did not decrease the number of recruited NK cells in all groups studied (Fig8I and Fig8L). Notably, treatment with anti-PD-L1 successfully blocked LPS-induced neutrophil recruitment and the increased presence of PD-L1- expressing neutrophils in mice on HFCD (Fig8J and Fig8L). On the other hand, these parameters remained unchanged in mice fed a standard chow diet (Fig8G, Fig8H). Overall, our findings suggest that anti-PD-L1 therapy decreased neutrophil-derived TNFα production in NAFLD mice without affecting the IFN-γ secretory activity of NK cells.</p>

<label>3.</label><title>Discussion</title>
<p>The pathogenesis of NAFLD and sepsis had been considered two independent conditions, associated with local and systemic inflammatory response, respectively. NAFLD is a chronic liver dysfunction characterized by the buildup of fat in the liver in individuals who do not consume excessive amounts of alcohol. On the other hand, sepsis is an inflammatory state triggered by an infection that damage vital organs, including the lungs and liver. This hyper-inflammatory response occurs when the body’s immune response fails to contain the microorganisms at the site of the primary infection(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>). Recent studies demonstrate that the presence of NAFLD is associated with an increased risk of developing sepsis(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>), but the exact mechanisms underlying this association are not fully understood. In the present study, we observed that NAFLD mice induced by an HFDC diet are more susceptible to a systemic and hepatic hyper-inflammatory state induced by endotoxemia, confirming in our experimental condition that NAFLD can be considered a crucial risk factor of sepsis progression, even when NAFLD or hepatic inflammation is not yet detected. After, we used this model to explore the cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in the increased susceptibility induced by endotoxemia in NAFLD animals. The LPS administration promotes the polarization of a specific subset of granulocytes expressing PD-L1, which secrete high levels of TNF-α in an NK-derived IFN-γ dependent manner. The released TNF-α plays an important role in the liver lesion. We also observed that CD4+ and CD8+ T cells or monocyte cells do not participate in the mice’s susceptibility during this hyper-inflammatory state. In accordance, previous studies implied NK cells in liver injuries in different NAFLD and sepsis experimental models(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>). It was observed that during severe sepsis, NK cells and NK cells- released IFN-γ play a detrimental role in mediating tissue injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>). Similarly, in NAFLD, NK cells can accumulate in the liver and release IFN-γ, which contributes to the development of hepatic inflammation and fibrosis(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>). These studies, together with our results, support that the increase in NK cells in endotoxemic NAFLD animals, along with IFN-γ secretion, contribute to hepatic disease progression.</p>
<p>Considering this evidence, we re-analyzed previously published bioinformatic data(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>) and observed that, in NAFLD patients, IFN-γ and TNFα are up-regulated, and that, in high-fat high fructose diet-fed mice, there is up-regulation of IFN-γ in NK cells, and TNFα and CD274 (PD-L1) in myeloid cells(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>), suggesting that similar immune dysfunctions are observed in patients and experimental model of NAFLD. To add experimental information about how the IFN-γ mediates the liver lesion, we demonstrated that, in endotoxemic NAFLD animals, hepatic neutrophils are important producers of TNFα, and this release is stimulated by NK-derived IFN-γ signaling. In addition, IFN-γ promoted the differentiation of PDL-1 expressing neutrophils, given that in those animals depleted of NK, the neutrophils did not exhibit this activated phenotype. Moreover, the PDL-1-expressing neutrophils showed a reduced apoptosis rate, increasing the retention time of the neutrophils in hepatic tissue. Thus, these events could explain the increase in hepatic injury in NAFLD animals during endotoxemia. According, to the context of infection-triggered inflammation, the participation of IFN-γ in the modulation of neutrophil pro-inflammatory profiles, including the expression of PD-L1, has been demonstrated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>). Neutrophils, as frontline innate immune cells, control pathogens through phagocytosis and the release of microbial mediators, including cytokines, cytosolic enzymes, free radicals, and NETs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>). However, excessive neutrophil activity can lead to tissue damagewhere they contribute significantly to multi-organ damage via the overproduction of inflammatory mediators, including TNF-α(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>). During NAFLD, liver neutrophils are major sources of TNF-α production induced by endotoxemia. Confirming the involvement of TNF-α release by PDL-1+ neutrophils stimulated by NK cells-derived IFN-γ in the increase of susceptibility of NAFLD, we demonstrated that the absence of TNF-α signaling or depleted NK cells led to improved survival in mice with NAFLD during endotoxemia. However, the deficiency of TNF-α signaling did not affect PD-L1 expression in neutrophils. These findings imply that, while TNFα plays a crucial tissue lesion role, its intracellular signaling does not impair the expression of PD-L1 in the neutrophils or their migration into liver tissue during NAFLD. To reinforce that neutrophils are the main source of the TNFα involved in susceptibility of NAFLD by endotoxemia, we evaluate whether neutralizing these cells with specific antibodies could improve the survival of endotoxemic HFDC-fed mice. Numerous strategies targeting neutrophils have been investigated in clinical and experimental settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>) including the use of CXCR2 inhibitors in NASH patients(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>). Interestingly, we demonstrated that targeting neutrophils with different biological drugs, similar to the inhibition of TNF-α, mitigated inflammation-induced liver lesions.</p>
<p>Recent studies suggest that during the progression of NAFLD, PD-L1 is expressed in both parenchymal and non-parenchymal cells(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>). Given that the neutrophils responsible for hepatic damage in endotoxemic NAFLD mice exhibit a specific PD-L1-expressing phenotype, <italic>we</italic> demonstrated that anti-PD-L1 significantly reduced TNFα-producing PD-L1+ neutrophils in the liver environment, attenuating endotoxemia-induced inflammation and liver damage, ultimately reducing mortality in NAFLD mice. This highlights the role of PD-L1 expression in neutrophils in promoting a proinflammatory phenotype associated with heightened TNFα production and susceptibility of endotoxemic HFDC-fed mice. In the context of endotoxemia, recent research indicates that PD-L1-expressing neutrophils also contribute to immunosuppression and increased susceptibility to secondary infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>) and also contribute to lung injury [36]. Thus, our data support that the PD-L1 inhibition, besides preventing the organ lesions induced by hyper-inflammatory responses in NAFLD patients could also abolish the long-term immunosuppression observed in these patients.</p>
<p>Although macrophages, including Kupffer cells, have been considered a relevant source of cytokines in endotoxemic animals(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>), we did not find an important role for these cells expressing CCR2 in the aggravation of endotoxemia, since the absence of this chemokine receptor, which governs the migration and differentiation of monocytes into macrophages, did not influence the endotoxemia mortality in animals with NAFLD. However, it’s worth noting that we did not extensively investigate the interaction of IFN-γ and TNF-α in the role of monocytes in our model, necessitating further studies to unravel the possible mechanisms of these cells.</p>
<p>Overall, our findings establish a biological basis for understanding the progression of endotoxemia in NAFLD, highlighting the dysregulated role of neutrophils in which hepatic metabolic syndrome potentiates the inflammatory effects of granulocytes via NK cells, advocating interventions to mitigate this inflammatory condition.</p>

To assess survival, it was inoculated 24 hours before the LPS challenge and then once a day for 7 days.</p>

<title>Single-cell RNA sequencing analysis</title>
<p>We re-analyzed single-cell transcriptomic data (GSE166504) from mouse liver from mice with NAFLD and their respective control groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>). The dataset was downloaded and the RDS file was imported into R(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>) environment version v4.2.3 and Seurat v4.1.1(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>) by filtering genes expressed in at least 300 cells. For the pre- processing step, outlier cells were filtered out based on three metrics (library size &lt; 20,000, number of expressed genes between 200 and 4,000, and mitochondrial percentage expression &lt; 0,8). The top 3,000 variable genes were then identified using the ‘best’ method using the FindVariableFeatures function. Percent of mitochondrial genes was regressed out in the scaling step, and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was performed using the top 3,000 variable genes and the top 30 PCs were selected for dimension reduction by Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP). Clusters were identified using the author’s annotation. Then, differential gene expression analysis was performed using the FindAllMarkers function in Seurat with default parameters to obtain a list of significant gene markers for each cluster of cells. Visualization of genes illustrating expression levels was performed using R/Seurat commands (DimPlot, FeaturePlot, and DotPlot) using ggplot2(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>) and customized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>) R packages.</p>

<title>RNA sequencing analysis</title>
<p>RNA-seq data were obtained from GSE185051 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>). The R/Bioconductor package edgeR was used to identify differentially expressed genes among the samples, after removing absent features (zero counts in more than 75% of samples) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>). Genes with a fold change of &gt;0.5 were identified as differentially expressed.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4m">
<title>Pathway enrichment analysis</title>
<p>The list of differentially expressed genes was enriched using the ClusterProfiler R package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>). Gene ontology (GO) terms in the Biological Processes category with P &lt; 0.05 were considered significant. Statistically significant, non-redundant GO- enriched terms were plotted.</p>

<title>Statistics</title>
<p>Statistical significance was determined by two-tailed paired or unpaired Student’s t-test or one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s post hoc test. Absolute numbers and percentages were compared using Fisher’s exact test. Spearman rank order correlation (r) was calculated to describe the correlations. P&lt;0.05 was considered statistically significant. Statistical analyses and graphics were performed using the GraphPad Prism 8.4.2 software.</p>

<p>This <bold>important</bold> study highlights the key role of NK cells and PD-L1+ neutrophils in worsening sepsis responses in the context of of MASH (metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis). While the data are <bold>solid</bold>, the overall evidence for the role of neutrophils in mediating this effect, which is based on a choline-deficient high-fat diet model of various knockouts or selective ablation of immune cell types, remains <bold>incomplete</bold>.

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>By using an established NAFLD model, choline-deficient high-fat diet, Barros et al show that LPS challenge causes excessive IFN-γ production by hepatic NK cells which further induces recruitment and polarization of a PD-L1 positive neutrophil subset leading to massive TNFα production and increased host mortality. Genetic inhibition of IFN-γ or pharmacological blockade of PD-L1 decreases recruitment of these neutrophils and TNFα release, consequently preventing liver damage and decreasing host death.</p>
<p>Since NAFLD is often accompanied by chronic, low-grade inflammation, it can lead to an overactive but dysfunctional immune response and increase the body's overall susceptibility to infections, therefore this is a very important research question.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>I have quite a lot of concerns with this manuscript. One of those is that the authors did not indeed show that the seen effect is really due to NAFLD itself. The role of choline is already known in the context of sepsis since its deficiency (which can be observed in about two weeks through deterioration of liver structure and function) leads to body organ dysfunction both in humans and animals. Nolan and Vilayat in 1968 showed that the hepatic injury and mortality due to endotoxinaemic shock induced by intraperitoneal injection of LPS was significantly increased in adult female Holtzman rats fed on a choline-deficient diet. Therefore, in order to really show that the effect is mediated due to NAFLD some other diet model must be used (e.g. high-fat, high-fructose, and high-cholesterol diet).</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This is an extremely interesting mouse study, trying to understand how sepsis is tolerated during obesity/NAFLD. The researchers combine a well-established model of NASH (Choline-deficiency with High Fat Diet) with a sepsis model (IP injection of 10mg/kg LPS), leading to dramatic mortality in mice. Using this model, they characterize the complex contributions of immune cells. Specifically, they find that NK-cells and Neutrophils contribute the most to mortality in this model due to IFNG and PD-L1+ Neutrophils.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The biggest strength of the manuscript is how clear the primary phenotypes/endpoints of their model are. Within 6 hours of LPS injection, there is a stark elevation of liver inflammation and damage, which is exacerbated by a High Fat/CholineDeficient diet (HFCD). And after 1 day, almost all of the mice die. Using these endpoints, the authors were able to identify which cells were critical for mortality in the model and the specific mediators involved.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>A few key details regarding the experimental design and interpretation are missing.</p>
<p>Most important is the choice of a high-fat diet with choline deficiency. I believe this model was chosen because the experiments are shorter and typically result in a liver inflammatory phenotype with not as clear of an adipose/obesity phenotype. I actually think it is typically considered a NASH (Non-alcoholic Steatohepatitis) model. I don't think the manuscript includes any data regarding the physiology of these mice that you would expect in an obesity model: body weight, liver weight, blood glucose, etc.</p>
<p>You should include a description in the methods for how the survival studies were conducted. Were the mice just checked on once a day for death, or were there other endpoints for euthanasia, like severe weight loss?</p>
<p>The measurement of IFNG and TNF in tissue throughout the manuscript seemed inconsistent. For example, IFNG in Figure 3A is 0.05pg/g for Chow+LPS, and 0.15pg.g for HFCD+LPS. But in Figure 4H, Chow+LPS is 0.18pg/g and HFCD+LPS is 0.18pg/g, so there is no effect of HFCD in the IgG controls. Also, in Figure 4I and 4J, the TNF values are dramatically different for the controls (0.1 vs 1pg/g).</p>
<p>You can't conclude that CD4+ and CD8+ T cells or monocytes don't play a role in liver damage from your data, because you did not measure liver damage, only mortality. I understand using mortality as an endpoint, but without ALT/AST measurements or histology, it's hard to say what exactly happened in the livers.</p>
<p>I'm not sure the authors can conclude that neutrophils expressing PD-L1 live longer in the hepatic environment from an in vitro experiment. I think this is an interesting result in terms of crosstalk between these two cell types, but I'm not sure that in vivo the neutrophils would live longer.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors investigated how non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) influences liver damage during endotoxemia (a condition characterized by elevated endotoxins, like lipopolysaccharide or LPS, in the bloodstream) using a mouse model. Mice with NAFLD were given a moderate dose of LPS, which intensified liver inflammation and mortality compared to controls. The study concludes that targeting neutrophil activity and TNF-α signaling could be a promising approach to reducing excessive inflammation and liver injury in NAFLD patients experiencing endotoxemia. This can have important implications for the treatment but I think the manuscript requires revisions.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) The study presents both in vivo and ex vivo assay and results to support their hypothesis.</p>
<p>(2) Several cell types and their interaction with each other have been analyzed.</p>
<p>(3) The authors made use of the publicly available databases.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) Some figures contradict each other.</p>
<p>(2) Some of the cause-and-effect presentations need additional experiments and different approaches to be proven correct.</p>
<p>(3) Candidate/mechanism selection strategies are not very clear.</p>
