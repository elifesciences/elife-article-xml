<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Collagen-I fibrillogenesis is crucial to health and development, where dysregulation is a hallmark of fibroproliferative diseases. Here, we show that collagen-I fibril assembly required a functional endocytic system that recycles collagen-I to assemble new fibrils. Endogenous collagen production was not required for fibrillogenesis if exogenous collagen was available, but the circadian-regulated vacuolar protein sorting (VPS) 33b and collagen-binding integrin-α11 subunit were crucial to fibrillogenesis. Cells lacking VPS33b secrete soluble collagen-I protomers but were deficient in fibril formation, thus secretion and assembly are separately controlled. Overexpression of VPS33b led to loss of fibril rhythmicity and over-abundance of fibrils, which was mediated through integrin α11β1. Endocytic recycling of collagen-I was enhanced in human fibroblasts isolated from idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, where VPS33b and integrin-α11 subunit were overexpressed at the fibrogenic front; this correlation between VPS33b, integrin-α11 subunit, and abnormal collagen deposition was also observed in samples from patients with chronic skin wounds. In conclusion, our study showed that circadian-regulated endocytic recycling is central to homeostatic assembly of collagen fibrils and is disrupted in diseases.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Collagen fibrils account for ∼25% of total body protein mass [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>] and are the largest protein polymers in vertebrates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>]. The fibrils can exceed centimeters in length and are organized into elaborate networks to provide structural support for cells. It is unclear how the fibrils are formed and how this process goes awry in collagen pathologies, such as fibrosis. A key mechanism, cell surface mediated fibrillogenesis, has been suggested to occur via indirect binding to fibronectin fibrils, or via direct assembly by collagen-binding integrins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>]. Interestingly, fibrils can be reconstituted <italic>in vitro</italic> from purified collagen (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>]) but the assembly process is not controlled to the extent seen <italic>in vivo</italic> in terms of number, size and organization; this suggests a much tighter cellular control over the process. Additional support for tight cellular control of collagen fibril formation comes from electron microscope observations of collagen fibrils at the plasma membrane of embryonic avian and rodent tendon fibroblasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>], where the end (tip) of a fibril is enclosed within a plasma membrane invagination termed a fibripositor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>]. Previously we identified vacuolar protein sorting (VPS) 33b (a regulator of SNARE-dependent membrane fusion in the endocytic pathway) as a circadian clock regulated protein involved in collagen homeostasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>]. VPS33B forms a protein complex with VIPAS39 (VIPAR) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>], and mutations in the <italic>VPS33B</italic> gene cause arthrogryposis-renal dysfunction-cholestasis (ARC) syndrome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>]. Here, death usually occurring within the first year of birth with renal insufficiency, jaundice, multiple congenital anomalies, and predisposition to infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>]. One proposed disease-causing mechanism is abnormal post-Golgi trafficking of lysyl hydroxylase 3 (LH3, PLOD3), which is essential for collagen homeostasis during development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>]. All these observations points to a central role for the endosome, situated in proximity of the plasma membrane and acting as a hub for a complex assortment of vesicles, in sorting collagen molecules to different fates.</p>
<p>Previous studies of collagen endocytosis have focused on collagen degradation and signaling, identifying additional collagen-binding proteins such as Endo180 and MRC1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>], as well as a role for non-integrin collagen-receptors involved in mediating signaling activities such as DDR1/DDR2 (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>]). Here, we showed that collagen uptake by fibroblasts is circadian rhythmic. Importantly, instead of degrading endocytosed collagen, cells utilize endocytic recycling of exogenous collagen-I to assemble new fibrils, even in the absence of endogenous collagen production. Further we showed that the secretion of soluble collagen protomers is separate from, and can occur independently to, collagen fibril assembly. We identified VPS33b and integrin-α11 subunit (part of the collagen-binding integrin α11β1 heterodimer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>]) as central molecules specific to fibril formation. Finally, we showed that in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), a life threatening disease with unknown trigger/mechanism where lung tissue is replaced with collagen fibrils, integrin α11 subunit and VPS33B are located at the invasive fibroblastic focus where collagen fibril rapidly accumulates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>]; IPF fibroblasts also have elevated endocytic recycling of exogenous collagen-I, despite having similar collagen-I expression level to normal fibroblasts. Together, these results provide novel insights into the importance of the circadian clock-regulated endosomal system in normal fibrous tissue homeostasis, where fibrillogenesis occurs with both endogenous collagen and/or recycled scavenged exogenous collagen. This work also highlights that collagen utilization, rather than production (i.e. assembled into fibrils vs. protomeric secretion), is central to the maintenance of homeostasis, and dysregulation leads to disease.</p>

<title>Collagen-I is taken up into vesicle-like structures within the cell, and reassembled into fibril s</title>
<p>To study collagen-I endocytosis and the fate of endocytosed collagen, we made Cy3 labeled collagen-I (Cy3-colI) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>] and incubated it with explanted murine tail tendons for 3 days, then imaged the core of the tendon. Cells in tendon (nuclei marked with Hoechst stain) showed a clear uptake of Cy3-colI (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref></bold>, yellow box, indicated by yellow arrowheads). Interestingly, fibrillar Cy3 fluorescence signals that extend across cells were also observed (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref></bold>, grey box, indicated by white arrows). Pulse-chase experiments were performed where Cy3-colI was added to the tendons for 3 days, followed by 5FAM-colI for a further 2 days (<bold>Figure S1A</bold>). The results showed distinct areas where only Cy3-colI was observed (<bold>Figure S1A</bold>, yellow box); this persistence indicated that not all collagen endocytosed by cells is directed for degradation. 5FAM-positive fibril-like structures were also observed, confirming that collagen-I taken up by tissues is reincorporated into the matrix (<bold>Figure S1A</bold>, grey boxes). To confirm these findings in 2D cultures, we incubated immortalized murine tendon fibroblast cultures (iTTF) with labelled Cy3-colI. Flow cytometry analysis revealed that most cells had taken up Cy3-colI after overnight incubation (<bold>Figure S1B</bold>). Further time course analyses revealed a time-dependent and concentration-dependent increase of collagen-I uptake (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref></bold>). Cells incubated with Cy3-ColI for one hour followed by trypsinization were then analyzed using flow cytometry imaging, revealing that collagen-I is endocytosed by the cells into distinct structures (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref></bold>). Similar results were obtained using Cy5-labelled collagen-I (<bold>Figure S1C, D, E</bold>). To confirm that the labelled collagen-I is in fact endocytosed into the fibroblasts and not only associated with the cell surface when cells are still attached, we performed live-imaging on cells incubated with Cy3-colI. Time lapse images showed Cy3-colI congregate in structures within the cell, as indicated with white arrows (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref></bold>). We then incubated iTTFs with Cy3-colI for one hour, before trypsinizing and replating the cells to ensure any Cy3-colI signal detected hereon originated from the endocytosed pool. Immunofluorescence (IF) staining indicated co-localization of endogenous collagen-I with Cy3-labeled collagen-I (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref></bold>). These results demonstrated that exogenous collagen-I can be taken up by cells both <italic>in vitro</italic> and in tissues <italic>ex vivo</italic>, and recycled into fibrils.</p>

</fig>
<p>We considered the possibility that the fluorescent fibril-like structures were the result of spontaneous cell-free fibrillogenesis of the added Cy3-colI. Thus, we incubated Cy3-colI at concentrations spanning the 0.4 µg/mL critical concentration for cell-free <italic>in vitro</italic> fibril formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>], with or without cells (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref></bold>). In cell-free cultures, Cy3-positive fibrils were observed at 1 µg/mL and 5 µg/mL with no discernible Cy3-positive fibrils at 0.1 µg/mL Cy3-colI (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref></bold>, right panel). However, in the presence of cells, Cy3-positive fibrillar structures were observed at the cell surfaces at all concentrations of Cy3-colI examined, including 0.1 µg/mL (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref></bold> zoom ins of red box expanded to the left, highlighted by white arrows). These results indicated that the cells actively endocytosed and recycled Cy3-colI into fibrils.</p>

<sec id="s1b">
<title>The endocytic pathway controls collagen-I secretion and fibril assembly</title>
<p>Having shown that cells can take up and recycle collagen-I into extracellular fibrils, we then asked if endocytosis is required for collagen deposition. We used Dyngo4a (Dyng) to inhibit clathrin-mediated endocytosis, where Dyng treatment (20 µM) leads to ∼ 60% reduction in Cy3-colI uptake relative to control (<bold>Figure S2A</bold>), without affecting cell viability (<bold>Figure S2B</bold>). We then investigated the effects of Dyng treatment on the ability of wild-type fibroblasts to assemble collagen fibrils. Cells were treated with Dyng for 48 h before fixation and IF against collagen-I antibody. A significant reduction (average 60%) in the number of collagen-I fibrils assembled was observed (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref></bold>), indicative of endocytosis playing a key role in collagen-I fibrillogenesis. Conditioned media (CM) from these treated cells were also collected and assessed. To our surprise, the amount of soluble collagen-I secreted was also greatly reduced (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref></bold>). qPCR analyses revealed that <italic>Col1a1</italic> mRNA was significantly reduced in Dyng-treated cells (<bold>Figure S2C</bold>), suggesting a potential feedback mechanism between endocytosis and collagen-I synthesis, secretion, and fibrillogenesis. Interestingly, whilst <italic>Fn1</italic> mRNA was significantly lower in Dyng-treated cells (<bold>Figure S2C)</bold>, and the intensity of FN1 signal appears lower, the amount of FN1 fibrils deposited (as determined by the area occupied by fibrils) was not significantly impacted (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref></bold>). Taken together, these results showed that inhibiting endocytosis in fibroblasts does not lead to accumulation of soluble collagen-I protomers in the extracellular space. Rather, endocytosis impacts collagen fibrillogenesis and the transcriptional control on collagen-I and fibronectin.</p>

<title>Collagen-I endocytosis is circadian clock regulated, and recycling alone can generate fibrils</title>
<p>Previously, we have shown that clock-synchronized fibroblasts synthesize collagen fibrils in a circadian rhythmic manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>]; the results here thus far indicate an involvement of endocytosis in collagen fibrillogenesis. Therefore, we hypothesized that collagen-I endocytosis may also be circadian clock regulated. Time-series flow cytometry analyses of fibroblasts incubated with Cy3-colI revealed that the level of Cy3-colI endocytosed by the cells is rhythmic, with a periodicity of 23.8hrs as determined by MetaCycle analysis (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref></bold>). When corrected to the running average, the rhythmic nature of Cy3-colI uptake is accentuated (<bold>Figure S2D)</bold>. We noted that, when compared to the number of fibrils produced over time, the peak time of uptake has an inverse correlation with fibril numbers (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref></bold>). These data suggest that the cells may be endocytosing exogenous collagen under circadian control and holding it in the endosomal compartment, then trafficking the collagen to the plasma membrane for fibril formation.</p>
<p>To eliminate the possibility that the fluorescent fibril-like structures were due to attachment of fluorescently-labeled collagen protomers to pre-existing fibrils already deposited by cells, we performed an siRNA-mediated knockdown against <italic>Col1a1</italic> (siCol1a1) to target endogenous collagen production. Fibroblasts were then analyzed by IF using anti-collagen-I or anti-fibronectin (FN1) antibodies. Control (scrambled siRNAs, scr) cells synthesized collagen-I and fibronectin (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref></bold>, top row) with defined fibrillar structures. In contrast, cells treated with siCol1a1 synthesized lower-levels of collagen-I and fibronectin, with few collagen-I fibrillar structures as well as lower intracellular collagen-I signal (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref></bold>, bottom row). A ∼ 90% reduction in <italic>Col1a1</italic> mRNA was confirmed using qPCR (<bold>Figure S3A</bold>).</p>

<p>Flow cytometry analysis of cells incubated with Cy3-colI revealed that siCol1a1 fibroblasts retained the ability to endocytose exogenous collagen (<bold>Figure S3B</bold>). To assess if siCol1a1 fibroblasts can assemble a collagen fibril with exogenous collagen, Cy3-colI was incubated with scr or siCol1a1 cells for 1 hour, before trypsinization and replating to ensure no cell surface associated Cy3-colI remains. Within 3 days, Cy3-positive collagen fibrils were observed in both scr (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref></bold>, left column) and siCol1a1 cells (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref></bold>, right column). The observation of fibrillar Cy3 signals in siCol1a1 cells showed that the cells can repurpose collagen into fibrils without the requirement for intrinsic collagen-I production (red arrow, <bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref></bold>). The cells were also probed for collagen-I using an anti-collagen-I antibody with a secondary antibody conjugated to Alexa-488 (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref></bold>, second row). In scr cells we detected multiple fibrillar structures that did not contain Cy3-colI (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref></bold>, white arrows), indicating fibrils derived from endogenous collagen-I. In the siCol1a1 cells we detected a more diffuse signal and puncta within the cell, but no discernible Alexa-488-only collagen-I fibrils (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref></bold>). These results indicate that fibroblasts can assemble collagen-I fibrils from recycled exogenous collagen-I alone. Importantly, siCol1a1 cells treated with Dyng could not effectively form Cy3-collagen-containing fibrils under these conditions, confirming that siCol1a1 cells, like control cells (see <bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref></bold>), are endocytosing exogenous collagen to be recycled into new fibrils (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref></bold>).</p>

<title>VPS33B controls collagen fibril formation but not protomeric secretion</title>
<p>VPS33B is situated in a post-Golgi compartment where it is involved in endosomal trafficking with multiple functions including extracellular vesicle formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>], modulation of p53 signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>], and maintenance of cell polarity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>], dependent on cell type. We previously identified VPS33B to be a circadian-controlled component of collagen-I homeostasis in fibroblasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>]. As a result, we decided to further investigate its role in endosomal recycling of collagen-I.</p>
<p>We confirmed our previous finding that CRISPR-knockout of VPS33B (VPSko, as verified by western blot analysis and qPCR analysis, <bold>FigureS4AandB</bold>) in tendon fibroblasts led to fewer collagen fibrils without impacting proliferation (<bold>Figure S4C</bold>), as evidenced by both electron microscopy (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref></bold>) and IF imaging (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref></bold>). Decellularized matrices showed that VPSko fibroblasts produced less matrix by mass than control, which was mirrored by a reduction in hydroxyproline content (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref></bold>). We then stably overexpressed VPS33B in fibroblasts (VPSoe), as confirmed by western blot, qPCR analyses, and flow cytometry of transfected cells (<bold>Figure S4D-G</bold>). IF staining indicated a greater number of collagen-I fibrils in VPSoe cells (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref></bold>), although the mean total matrix and mean total hydroxyproline in VPSoe cultures was not significantly higher than control (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref></bold>). As VPSoe cells showed equivalent proliferation to controls (<bold>Figure S4F</bold>), this suggests VPSoe specifically enhanced the assembly of collagen fibrils. We then performed time-series IF on synchronized cell cultures to quantify the number of collagen fibrils formed. Tendon fibroblasts exhibited a ∼ 24 h rhythmic fluctuation in collagen-I fibril numbers, whereas VPSoe cells continuously deposited collagen-I fibrils over the 55-h period (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref></bold>). MetaCycle analyses indicated that fluctuation of fibril numbers in control and VPSoe cultures occurred at a periodicity of 22.7 h and 28.0 h respectively (<bold>Figure S4H</bold>), indicating that continuous expression of VPS33B leads to loss of collagen-I fibril circadian homeostasis. Interestingly, when assessing the levels of secreted soluble collagen-I protomers from control and VPSoe cells, VPSoe CM have lower levels of soluble collagen-I (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4J</xref></bold>). In addition, when VPS33B is knocked-down using siRNA, there is an elevation of soluble collagen-I secreted; siVPS33B on VPSoe cells also increased the levels of collagen-I in CM (<bold>Figure S4I, J</bold>), whilst VPS33b levels are not correlated with <italic>Col1a1</italic> expression levels (<bold>Figure S4K</bold>). This finding indicates that VPS33B is specifically involved in collagen-I fibril assembly, and not secretion. The reduction of secreted soluble collagen-I in VPSoe cells further supports that VPS33B directs collagen-I towards fibril assembly.</p>

<title>VPS33B-positive vesicles contain collagen-I</title>
<p>We then utilized the split-GFP system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>] to investigate how VPS33B specifically directs collagen-I to fibril assembly. Here, a GFP signal will be present if VPS33B co-traffics with collagen-I. We, and others, have previously demonstrated that insertion of tags at the N-terminus of proα2(I) or proα1(I) chain does not interfere with collagen-I folding or secretion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>]. To determine which terminus of the VPS33B protein GFP1-10 should be added, we performed computational ΔG analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>], which predicts that VPS33B contains two regions of extended hydrophobicity towards its C-terminus (<bold>Figure S5A</bold>). The first region (residues 565- 587, denoted TMD1) has a ΔG of −0.62 kcal/mol, consistent with a single pass type IV transmembrane domain (TMD), known as a tail-anchor. This arrangement locates the short C-terminus of VPS33B inside the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and subsequently within the endosomal compartment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>]. The second region (residues 591-609, denoted HR1) is significantly less hydrophobic, with a ΔG of +2.61 kcal/mol (<bold>Figure S5B</bold>). Its presence raises the possibility that VPS33B may contain two TMDs that, depending on their relative membrane topologies, result in either a luminal or cytosolic C-terminus (<bold>Figure S5C</bold>).</p>
<p>To define the topology of VPS33B, we used a well-established <italic>in vitro</italic> system where newly synthesized and radiolabeled proteins of interest are inserted into the membrane of ER-derived canine pancreatic microsomes, and created constructs with ER luminal modification of either endogenous N-glycosylation sites (N54, N545 in VPS33b), or artificial sites in an appended OPG2 tag (N2, N15 in residues 1-18 of bovine rhodopsin, Uniprot: P02699) as a robust reporter for membrane protein topology in the ER (<bold>Figure S5D, E</bold>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>]. Due to the N- terminal region of VPS33b being highly aggregation-prone in our <italic>in vitro</italic> system (<bold>Figure S5F, G</bold>), we created three additional chimeric proteins comprised of different regions of VPS33b and Sec61β to investigate the topology of VPS33B (<bold>Figure S5H</bold>). Whilst a small proportion of each chimera continued to pellet when synthesized in the absence of ER-derived microsomes (<bold>Figure S5I,</bold> lanes 3, 6, 9), N-gvlycosylated species were now clearly identifiable for each of the chimeras tested.</p>
<p>In chimera 1, given the respective efficiency of membrane insertion of the TA region and N-glycosylation of the C-terminal OPG tag of Sec61βOPG2 (<bold>Figure S4I,</bold> lanes 1-2), we attribute the N-glycosylated species to the C- terminal translocation of OPG2 tag, although it is evident that the remaining short stretch of VPS33b (residues 414-564) still impedes efficient membrane insertion, likely due to aggregation (<bold>Figure S4I</bold>, lanes 3-5) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>]. For chimera 2, the efficient modification of its distal N-glycosylation site (N15 of the OPG2 tag) but inefficient use of the proximal site (N2 of the OPG2 tag) reflects the latter residues’ close proximity to the ER membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>], and supports the <italic>bona fide</italic> membrane insertion of the VPS33b TMD1 and thus translocation of the C- terminal OPG2 tag into the ER lumen (<bold>Figure S4I</bold>, lanes 6-8). Interestingly, the inclusion of HR1 to the C-terminus of TMD1 in chimera 3 results in a substantial qualitative reduction in the amount of protein that is N- glycosylated (<bold>Figure S4I</bold>, lanes 7 and 10). Further, for the fraction of chimera 3 that is modified, the majority is doubly N-glycosylated; most likely due to the extra length provided by HR1, resulting in both N-glycosylation sites on the OPG2 tag (N2 and N15) now being efficiently modified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>].</p>
<p>The clear reduction in the proportion of N-glycosylated species obtained with chimera 3 compared to chimera 2 (<bold>Figure S4I</bold>) indicates that only a small proportion of HR1 and the appended OPG2 tag are successfully translocated into the ER lumen. This is likely due to a combination of the low proportion of hydrophobic residues and the presence of several charged and polar amino acids in HR1[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>]. We thus propose that, for a minority of VPS33b, TMD1 is inserted into the ER membrane as a tail-anchored region with a luminal HR1 that most likely remains associated with the inner leaflet of the bilayer (N-cytosolic, C-luminal; <bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref></bold>, right). In contrast, the majority of VPS33b likely assumes a ‘hairpin’ like conformation in the ER membrane where both its N- and C-termini remain in the cytosol (N-cytosolic, C-cytosolic) with either: i) a partially membrane inserted TMD1, with HR1 associated with the outer leaflet of the ER membrane (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref></bold>, left); or ii) a fully membrane inserted TMD1 followed by the marginally hydrophobic HR1 which may span the membrane through the formation of stabilizing hydrogen bonds with TMD1 (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref></bold>, middle) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>].</p>

<p>To test our topology findings, we inserted BFP at either the N- (VPSnBFP) or C-terminus (VPScBFP) of VPS33B. In cells expressing VPSnBFP, the fluorescence signal was diffuse throughout the cell body, and in some cases appeared to be completely excluded from vesicular structures (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref></bold>, left), suggestive of protein mistargeting. In contrast, VPScBFP-expressing cells have punctate, vesicular-like blue fluorescence signals and peripherally blue structures (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref></bold>, right), supportive of the topology findings. Previous studies have also tagged VPS33B at the C-terminus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>]. Thus, the 214-residue N-terminal fragment (GFP1-10) was cloned onto VPS33B, and the 17-residue C-terminal peptide (GFP11) was cloned onto the proα1(I) chain of collagen-I as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>] (GFP11-proα1(I), <bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref></bold>).</p>
<p>Fibroblasts stably expressing VPS-barrel and GFP11-proα1(I) were imaged to identify any GFP fluorescence. The results showed puncta throughout the cell body (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref></bold>). Intriguingly, GFP fluorescence was also observed at the cell periphery (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref></bold>, green box zoom). IF staining of endogenous VIPAS39 (a known VPS33B-interacting partner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>]) also revealed co-localization of VIPAS39 with collagen-I in intracellular vesicular structures (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref></bold>); in some of the co-localized vesicles, the signal of VIPAS39 is strongest surrounding collagen-I (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref></bold>, zoom), suggesting that VIPAS39 is encasing collagen-I, not within the vesicle lumen but present in proximity with the external membrane of the vesicle. VPS33B has been demonstrated to interact with VIPAS in regions before the TMD1 site [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>]; thus, in all suggested VPS33B topologies herein, VIPAS39 will still be able to interact with VPS33B, and encase collagen-I-containing vesicles.</p>
<p>Notably, when VPScBFP was overexpressed in Dendra2-collagen-I expressing 3T3 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>], the number of Dendra2-positive fibrils significantly increased, verifying the effects of VPS33B overexpression in fibroblast collagen-I deposition; however, the average length of the fibril was not significantly different, suggesting that VPS33B is important in fibril initiation but not elongation (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5F</xref></bold>). Flow cytometry analyses of fluorescently labelled-colI endocytosed by control, VPSko, and VPSoe fibroblasts revealed no consistent change in uptake by VPSko or VPSoe cells (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5G</xref></bold>). Taken together, these results suggest that VPS33B is involved in the trafficking of collagen-I to the extracellular space, and not endocytosis. VPSko cells replated after Cy5-colI uptake have conspicuously fewer fibrils when compared to control. In contrast, VPSoe cells have shorter but more Cy5-colI fibrils (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5H</xref></bold>), highlighting the role of VPS33B in recycling endocytosed collagen-I to fibril assembly sites.</p>

<p>We then interrogated the differences between VPSko and control cells, visualizing the results in a semi-quantitative manner using spectral counting (<bold>Table S3</bold>). Conspicuously, collagen α1(I) and α2(I) chains were detected at a reduced level at the surface of VPSko cells (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref></bold>). The reduction of α1(V) and α2(V) chains (which constitute type V collagen) from the cell surface supports the long-standing view that collagen-V nucleates collagen-I containing fibrils.

Whilst many integrins were detected in all samples there was an absence of integrin α1 and integrin α11 subunit in VPSko cultures (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref></bold>). It is well established that integrins are cell-surface molecules that interact extensively with the ECM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>], with integrin α11β1 functioning as a major collagen receptor on fibroblasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>]. Interestingly, whilst the level of integrin β1 chain detected was also reduced in VPSko cultures, it was not as drastic as the reduction of integrin α11 chain. This is likely due to the promiscuous nature of integrin β1 subunit, that is being able to partner with other α subunits for functions other than collagen-I interaction. The absence of integrin α11 subunit from VPSko cells suggested a link between VPS33B-mediated collagen fibrillogenesis and integrin α11β1.</p>
<p>VPS33B was conspicuous by its absence from cell-surface labeling studies of control samples (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D</xref></bold>). We have previously struggled to detect VPS33B protein using mass spectrometry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>] and postulate that its absence could be due to low abundance. Regardless, VPS33B was detected at the cell surface in VPSoe samples along with PLOD3 (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D</xref></bold>), previously identified to be delivered by VPS33B [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>]. Complementary western blot analysis of total cell lysates showed that expression of integrin α11 subunit is significantly reduced in VPSko cells and is elevated in VPSoe cells (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6E</xref></bold>). This correlation between VPS33B and integrin α11 expression levels was confirmed at the mRNA level (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6F</xref></bold>), inferring a link between VPS33B, collagen fibril, and integrin α11 abundance. We verified this by siRNA knockdown of <italic>Itga11</italic> in control and VPSoe fibroblasts, where knockdown efficiency is confirmed by qPCR (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6G</xref></bold>). siItga11 in both control and VPSoe cells reduced the number of collagen-I fibrils in culture (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6H</xref></bold>). Thus, even with elevated levels of VPS33B, integrin α11 subunit is required for collagen-I fibrillogenesis. Interestingly, knocking-down integrin α11 subunit increased exogenous collagen-I uptake as demonstrated by flow cytometry (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6I</xref></bold>). Thus, we propose that both VPS33B and integrin α11 are involved in directing collagen-I protomers to the formation of collagen-I fibrils, and not mediators of collagen-I endocytosis.</p>

<p>We next investigated if VPS33B and integrin α11 are involved in human fibrotic diseases, where accumulation of collagen fibrils is a disease hallmark.

Although <italic>COL1a1</italic> was similarly expressed, the levels of <italic>VPS33B</italic> and <italic>ITGA11</italic> were significantly increased in IPF fibroblasts compared to control. We next assessed the endocytic capacities of collagen-I, and found that IPF fibroblasts endocytosed significantly more Cy5-labelled exogenous collagen-I when compared to control fibroblasts (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7B</xref></bold>, left); uptake of Cy3-labelled exogenous collagen-I was also elevated, albeit not significantly (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7B</xref></bold>, right). Subsequent culture of cells that have taken up exogenous collagen-I revealed that IPF fibroblasts made more fluorescently-labeled collagen fibrils, indicating enhanced recycling of endocytosed collagen-I to fibrillogenic sites (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7C</xref></bold>). This <italic>in vitro</italic> observation was also represented in IPF pathology, where patient-derived lung samples showed enrichment of collagen-I which overlaps with both integrin α11 subunit and VPS33B within the IPF hallmark lesion (termed the fibroblastic focus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>], encircled by red dotted line, <bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7D</xref></bold>). In sites of emerging fibrotic remodeling, integrin α11 subunit and VPS33B are also detected (red asterisks, <bold>Figure S6A</bold>; additional N = 3 IPF specimens, <bold>Figure S6B</bold>), indicating a role for VPS33B/integrin α11 chain in collagen-I deposition in the context of IPF. In control lung samples, collagen-I and VPS33B were present whereas integrin α11 subunit was detected at negligible levels (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7F</xref>, Figure S6C</bold>). These results indicate that the proteins required for assembly of collagen into fibrils (i.e. integrin α11, VPS33B) are present at the fibrotic fronts of IPF, and that enhanced endocytic recycling of collagen-I by fibroblasts may be a disease-potentiating mechanism in IPF.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study we have identified the endosome as a major protagonist in controlling the assembly of type I collagen-containing fibrils, through a circadian rhythmic endocytic recycling route. Integral to this process is VPS33B (a circadian clock-regulated endosomal tethering molecule) and integrin α11 subunit (a collagen-binding transmembrane receptor when partnered with integrin β1 subunit). Collagen-I co-traffics with VPS33B in a VIPAS-containing endosomal compartment that directs collagen-I to sites of fibril assembly, which requires integrin α11. These proteins are all enhanced at active sites of collagen pathologies such as fibrosis and chronic skin wounds, suggestive of a common disease mechanism.</p>
<p>Previous research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>] has focused on degradation or signaling as the endpoint of collagen-I endocytosis. However, our results show that collagen-I endocytosis contributes towards fibril formation, which is reduced when endocytosis is inhibited. The decision between degrading or recycling endocytosed collagen may depend on cell type, microenvironment, or collagen type itself. In complex environments, for example a wound, degradation of damaged collagen molecules and recycling of structurally sound collagen molecules could be beneficial. The requirement of VPS33B for fibril assembly confirms the previously-observed rhythmicity of collagen fibril formation by fibroblasts, <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>]. Our discovery that the endosomal system is involved in fibril assembly explains how collagen fibrils can be assembled in the absence of endogenous collagen synthesis, namely, if collagen can be retrieved from the extracellular space. We also observed a delay between maximum uptake and maximum fibril numbers. A possible function of this delay may be to increase the concentration of collagen-I in readiness for more efficient fibril initiation. This is supported by our findings that fibroblasts can utilize a solution of Cy3-colI lower than the 0.4 µg/mL critical concentration for fibril formation to assemble fibrils. Surface biotin-labelling in fibroblasts identified two integrin α subunits (α1 and α11) to be absent in VPSko cells which could not make collagen fibrils. There are four known collagen-binding integrins (α1β1, α2β1, α10β1, α11β1), where α2β1 and α11β1 have affinity for fibrillar collagens and are expressed in fibroblasts <italic>in vivo</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>]. α1β1, in contrast, has been demonstrated <italic>in vitro</italic> to display higher affinity for collagen-IV than collagen-I [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>]; it has a wide expression pattern <italic>in vivo</italic>, including basement membrane-associated smooth muscle cells, strongly suggesting that collagen-IV is the major ligand for α1β1 integrin instead. Thus, we focused on the effects of integrin α11 subunit. Interestingly, both α1 and α11 subunits were also reduced in VPSoe cells as detected by mass spectrometry; however, validation by western blots indicated that protein levels of integrin α11 follows VPS33B and collagen fibril numbers. We postulate that this discrepancy detected through MS might be due to integrin dynamics at the plasma membrane. Regardless, VPS33B and integrin α11β1 are essential for targeting collagen-I to fibril assembly and not for the secretion of soluble triple helical collagen-I molecules (i.e. protomers); there is also no evidence to support an active role for VPS33B or α11β1 in collagen endocytosis. We have also demonstrated involvement of VPS33B and integrin α11 subunit in IPF, particularly at sites of disease progression (fibroblastic foci). The presence of integrin α11 subunit confirms a recent study utilizing spatial proteomics to decipher regions of IPF tissues, where in addition to integrin α11 the authors also identified proteins involved in collagen biogenesis specific to the fibroblastic foci [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>]. Crucially, in our study, levels of <italic>Col1a1</italic> transcript were unchanged between control and IPF fibroblasts, and IHC demonstrated that collagen-I and VPS33B were prevalent in control lungs. This highlights that the production of collagen-I does not equate to fibril formation; indeed, here VPS33B is required for normal collagen homeostasis in the lung, and it is the combination of VPS33B and integrin α11 subunit, coupled with elevated endocytic recycling of exogenous collagen at the fibroblastic focus, that promotes excess collagen-I fibril assemblies, which is a hallmark of fibrosis. Furthermore, this relationship between excessive collagen-I, VPS33B, and integrin α11 is also observed in chronic skin wounds, where, similar to lung fibrosis, there is a chronic unresolved wound-healing response; this is suggestive of a common pathological molecular pathway between the two organs, based on enhanced endocytic recycling of collagen-I protomers directed to fibrillogenesis.</p>
<p>The discovery that VPS33B is required for collagen fibril formation but not collagen protomer secretion highlights an important distinction between ‘collagen secretion’ and ‘collagen fibrillogenesis’, especially in the context of collagen pathologies (e.g. fibrosis, cancer metastasis). In this context, it is crucial to keep in mind that elevated collagen levels (i.e. collagen transcripts or protomer levels) does not equate to the formation of an insoluble fibrillar network. This distinction was also suggested in a recent study on <italic>Pten-</italic>knockout mammary fibroblasts, where SPARC protein acts via fibronectin to affect collagen fibrillogenesis but not secretion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>]. Of note, whilst SPARC and fibronectin were detected in our previously-reported time-series mass spectrometry analyses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>], they were not circadian clock rhythmic in tendon.</p>
<p>The nucleation of a collagen-I fibril is expected to involve collagen-V, a minor fibril-forming collagen that is necessary for the appearance of collagen-I fibrils <italic>in vivo</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>]. Another long-standing view is that fibronectin may tether collagen to a fibronectin-binding integrin and thereby function as a proteolytically cleavable anchor ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>], reviewed by [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>]). Whilst the present study did not focus on the role of fibronectin, IF staining suggested that collagen-I and fibronectin do not completely overlap, and that inhibition of endocytosis did not affect fibronectin fibril numbers. Recent data using cells deficient in fibronectin assembly also suggested that cell-mediated collagen fibrillogenesis can be mediated via integrin α11β1 at the cell membrane, independent of FN (Personal correspondence, Donald Gullberg). Further, biotin-surface labeling mass spectrometry analysis in the present study indicated that the levels of the major fibronectin-binding integrins (integrins α5β1, αVβ3) were not drastically altered between control, VPSko, and VPSoe fibroblasts, indicating that VPS33B controls collagen fibrillogenesis via a fibronectin-independent route. Interestingly, in fibronectin knockout liver cells, exogenous collagen-V could be added to initiate collagen-I fibrillogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>], which suggests that other matrix proteins could also be recycled in a similar manner as collagen-I. Whilst collagen α1(V) could only be detected in surface biotin-labeled control but not VPSko or VPSoe cells, collagen α2(V) was only detected in VPSoe cells. Of note, we have previously shown that collagen α2(V) protein was rhythmic and in phase with collagen α1(I) and collagen α2(I). Whether collagen-V co-traffics with collagen-I in VPS33B vesicle-like compartments to fibrillogenic sites at the cell periphery, or collagen-V is directed to the nucleation site by another route, is an important question to address in future studies. Indeed, endocytic recycling of other factors required for collagen fibrillogenesis (e.g. other nucleation factors such as collagen-V, collagen-XI, integrins), in addition to collagen-I protomers, may be required for fibril assembly by fibroblasts.</p>
<p>Previous research has demonstrated that collagen-I can be secreted within minutes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>], whilst other studies have demonstrated a relatively slow emergence of collagen-I fibrils over days in culture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>]. The delay in assembly of fibrils could be due to the requirement to reach the threshold concentration of collagen needed for fibrillogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>]. Procollagen-I can be converted to collagen-I within the secretory pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>] in a process that requires giantin for intracellular N-terminal processing of procollagen-I [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>]. Thus, it is possible that triple helical collagen-I protomers destined for fibril formation are: 1) directed straight to a VPS33B- positive compartment from the Golgi apparatus, or 2) quickly secreted and then recaptured, via endocytosis, prior to recycling for fibrillogenesis. Such a mechanism would provide the cell with additional opportunities to determine the number of fibrils, the rate at which they are to be initiated, and their required growth in the extracellular matrix (see <xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9</xref>). We have not identified the specific proteins that mediate collagen-I uptake into the cell, however as inhibition of clathrin-mediated endocytosis did not completely inhibit collagen endocytosis, it is likely that collagen-I has multiple routes to enter the cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>]. With regards to the fibrillogenesis route, although a recent model of VPS33B/VIPAS39 protein complexes does not consider the possibility that VPS33B can associate directly with vesicular membranes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>], our <italic>in vitro</italic> studies suggest its hydrophobic C-terminal region can act as a tail-anchor domain. Importantly, the proposed model of the VPS33B/VIPAS39 complex suggests the C-terminus of VPS33B would be available for membrane association, consistent with our <italic>in vitro</italic> findings. Further studies will be required to establish whether differences between our models reflect alternative experimental systems, yeast vs. mammalian, and/or the behavior of VPS33B alone vs. in complex with VIPAS39. We found that endogenous VIPAS39 encases collagen-I in vesicle-like structures, consistent with a model where VPS33B and VIPAS39 co-traffic with collagen-I at the same endosomal compartment (see also [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>]). Our data suggest two membrane bound populations of VPS33B, the majority with a hairpin-like structure and cytosolic C-terminus and a minority that spans the membrane with the C-terminus inside the vesicle lumen. Whether or not alternative topologies of VSP33B are associated with different biological functions remains to be determined. Nonetheless, here we have identified a previously unknown role for endocytosis in collagen fibrillogenesis, which is exploited in collagen pathologies.</p>

<title>Protein extraction and western blotting</title>
<p>For lysate experiments, proteins were extracted using urea buffer (8 M urea, 50 mM Tris-HCl pH7.5, supplemented with protease inhibitors and 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol). For conditioned media (CM) media, cells were plated out at 200,000 cells per 6-well plate, and left for 48-72 h before 250 μl was sampled. Samples were mixed with 4xSDS loading buffer with 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol and boiled at 95°C for 5 min. The proteins were separated on either NuPAGE Novex 10% polyacrylamide Bis–Tris gels with 1XNuPAGE MOPS SDS buffer or 6% Tris-glycine gels with 1XTris-glycine running buffer (all Thermo Fisher Scientific), and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes (GE Healthcare). The membranes were blocked in 5% skimmed milk powder in PBS containing 0.01% Tween 20. Antibodies were diluted in 2.5% skimmed milk powder in PBS containing 0.01% Tween 20. The primary antibodies used were: rabbit polyclonal antibody (pAb) to collagen-I (1:1,000; Gentaur), mouse mAb to vinculin (1:1000; Millipore), rabbit pAb to integrin α11 subunit (1:1000; see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref>]) and mouse mAb to VPS33B (1:500; Proteintech). Horseradish-peroxidase-conjugated antibodies and Pierce ECL western blotting substrate (both from Thermo Fisher Scientific) were used and reactivity was detected on GelDoc imager (Biorad).

Supernatant was then transferred to a fresh tube and 1/5 of the lysates were kept as a reference sample. Streptavidin-Sepharose beads are then aliquoted into each sample and incubated for 30 min at 4 °C rotating. Beads were then washed 3x in ice cold PBS supplemented with 1% TritonX, followed by one final wash in ice cold PBS and boiled at 95 °C for 10 min in 2x sample loading buffer, followed by centrifugation at top speed for 5 min follow by sample preparation for Mass Spectrometry analysis. The protocol used for sample preparation was as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref>]. Mass spectrometry results files were exported into Proteome Discoverer (PD) for identification and spectral counting. All searches included the fixed modification for carbamidomethylation on cysteine residues resulting from IAA treatment to prevent cysteine bonding. The variable modifications included in the search were oxidized methionine (monoisotopic mass change, +15.955 Da); hydroxylation of asparagine, aspartic acid, proline, or lysine (monoisotopic mass change, +15.955 Da); and phosphorylation of threonine, serine, and tyrosine (79.966 Da). A maximum of 2 missed cleavages per peptide was allowed. The minimum precursor mass was set to 350Da with a maximum of 5000. Precursor mass tolerance was set to 10ppm, fragment mass tolerance was 0.02Da and minimum peptide length was 6. Peptides were searched against the Swissprot database using Sequest HT with a maximum false discovery rate of 1%. Proteins required a minimum FDR of 1% and were filtered to remove known contaminants and to have at least 2 unique peptides. Missing values were assumed to be due to low abundance. For spectral counting, enriched samples were normalized and spectral matches were compared. Peptide spectral matches were only included if they were calculated to have a q-value of less than 0.01.</p>

<p>For fluorescence live imaging of Cy3-colI internalisation, iTTF cells were seeded for 24 h onto Ibidi µ-plates and stained using CellMask™ Green Plasma Membrane Stain (Invitrogen C37608) according to the manufacturers protocol. Cy3-colI was added to cells and images were collected in a 37<bold>°</bold>C chamber using a Zeiss 3i spinning disk (CSU-X1, Yokagowa) confocal microscope with a 63x/1.40 Plan-Apochromat oil objective. 7.5 µm z-stacks with a step size of 0.5 µm were captured at 2 minute intervals using 488 nm (100 power, 150 ms exposure) and 561 nm (100 power, 100 ms exposure) lasers with SlideBook 6.0 software (3i) and a front illuminated Prime sCMOS camera. Imaris 9.9.1 software was then used to generate 3D reconstructions.</p>
<p>For fixed immunofluorescence imaging, cells plated on coverslips or Ibidi μ-plates were fixed with 100% methanol at −20°C and then permeabilized with 0.2% Triton-X in PBS. Primary antibodies used were as follows: rabbit pAb collagen-I (1:400, Gentaur OARA02579), rabbit pAb VIPAS (1:50, Proteintech 20771-1-AP), mouse mAb FN1 (1:400, Sigma F6140 or Abcam ab6328). Secondary antibodies conjugated to Alexa-488, Alexa-647, Cy3, and Cy5 were used (ThermoScientific), and nucleus were counterstained with DAPI (Sigma). Coverslips were mounted using Fluoromount G (Southern Biotech). Images were collected using a Leica SP8 inverted confocal microscope (Leica) using an x63/0.50 Plan Fluotar objective. The confocal settings were as follows: pinhole, 1 Airy unit; scan speed, 400 Hz bidirectional; format 1024 x 1024 or 512 x 512.

<p>This <bold>important</bold> work substantially advances our understanding of how collagen fibrils are built and maintained in a manner regulated by circadian rhythms in intracellular secretory trafficking pathways. The evidence supporting the data are <bold>solid</bold>, although further data regarding the molecular mechanisms regulating endocytic recycling of collagen would have strengthened the study. The work will be of considerable interest to those who study extracellular matrix assembly or collagen homeostasis.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors describe that the endocytic pathway is crucial for ColI fibrillogenesis. ColI is endocytosed by fibroblasts, prior to exocytosis and formation of fibrils, which can include a mixture of endogenous/nascent ColI chains and exogenous ColI. ColI uptake and fibrillogenesis are regulated by circadian rhythm as described by the authors in 2020, thanks to the dependence of this pathway on circadian-clock-regulated protein VPS33B. Cells are capable of forming fibrils with recently endocytosed ColI when nascent chains are not available. Previously identified VPS33B is demonstrated not to have a role in endocytosis of ColI, but to play a role in fibril formation, which the authors demonstrate by showing the loss of fibril formation in VPS33B KO, and an excess of insoluble fibrils - along-side a decrease in soluble ColI secretion - in VPS33B overexpression conditions. A VPS33B binding protein VIPAS39 is also shown to be required for fibrillogenesis and to colocalise with ColI. The authors thus conclude that ColI is internalised into endosomal structures within the cell, and that ColI, VPS33B, and VIPA39 are co-trafficked to the site of fibrillogenesis, where along with ITGA11, which by mass spectrometric analysis is shown to be regulated by VPS33B levels, ColI fibrils are formed. Interestingly, in involved human skin sections from idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) patients, ITGA11 and VPS33B expression is increased compared to healthy tissue, while in patient-derived fibroblasts, uptake of fluorescently-labelled ColI is also increased. This suggests that there may be a significant contribution of endocytosis-dependent fibrillogenesis in the formation of fibrotic and chronic wound-healing diseases in humans.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This is an interesting paper that contributes an exciting novel understanding of the formation of fibrotic disease, which despite its high occurrence, still has no robust therapeutic options. The precise mechanisms of fibrillogenesis are also not well understood, so a study devoted to this complex and key mechanism is well appreciated. The dependence of fibrillogenesis on VPS33B and VIPA39 is convincing and robust, while the distinction between soluble ColI secretion and insoluble fibrillar ColI is interesting and informative.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>There are a number of limitations to this study in its current state. Inhibition of ColI uptake is performed using Dyngo4a, which although proposed as an inhibitor of Clathrin-dependent endocytosis is known to be quite un-specific. This may not be a problem however, as the endocytic mechanism for ColI also does not seem to be well defined in the literature, in fact, the principle mechanism described in the papers referred to by the authors is that of phagocytosis. It would be interesting to explore this important part of the mechanism further, especially in relation to the intracellular destination of ColI. The circadian regulation does not appear as robust as the authors' last paper, however, there could be a larger lag between endocytosis of ColI and realisation of fibrils. The authors state that the endocytic pathway is the mechanism of trafficking and that they show ColI, VPS33B, and VIPA39 are co-trafficked. However, the only link that is put forward to the endosomes is rather tenuously through VPS33B/VIPA39. There is no direct demonstration of ColI localisation to endosomes (ie. immunofluorescence), and this is overstated throughout the text. Demonstrating the intracellular trafficking and localisation of ColI, and its actual relationship to VPS33B and VIPA39, followed by ITGA11, would broaden the relevance of this paper significantly to incorporate the field of protein trafficking. Finally, the &quot;self-formation&quot; of ColI fibrils is discussed in relation to the literature and the concentration of fluorescently-tagged ColI, however as the key message of the paper is the fibrillogenesis from exocytosed colI, I do not feel like it is demonstrated to leave no doubt. Specific inhibition of intracellular trafficking steps, or following the progressive formation of ColI fibrils over time by immunofluorescence would demonstrate without any further doubt that ColI must be endocytosed first, to form fibrils as a secondary step, rather than externally-added ColI being incorporated directly to fibrils, independent of cellular uptake.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this manuscript, the authors describe a mechanism, by which fluorescently-labelled Collagen type I is taken up by cells via endocytosis and then incorporated into newly synthesized fibers via an ITGA11 and VPS33B-dependent mechanism. The authors claim the existence of this collagen recycling mechanism and link it to fibrotic diseases such as IPF and chronic wounds.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The manuscript is well-written, and experimentally contains a broad variation of assays to support their conclusions. Also, the authors added data of IPF patient-derived fibroblasts, patient-derived lung samples, and patient-derived samples of chronic wounds that highlight a potential in vivo disease correlation of their findings.</p>
<p>The authors were also analyzing the membrane topology of VPS33B and could unravel a likely 'hairpin' like conformation in the ER membrane.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Experimental evidence is missing that supports the non-degradative endocytosis of the labeled collagen.</p>
<p>The authors show and mention in the text that the endocytosis inhibitor Dyngo®4a shows an effect on collagen secretion. It is not clear to me how specific this readout is if the inhibitor affects more than endocytosis. This issue was unfortunately not further discussed. The authors use commercial rat tail collagen, it is unclear to me which state the collagen is in when it's endocytosed. Is it fully assembled as collagen fiber or are those single heterotrimers or homotrimers?</p>
<p>The Cy-labeled collagen is clearly incorporated into new fibers, but I'm not sure whether the collagen is needed to be endocytosed to be incorporated into the fibers or if that is happening in the extracellular space mediated by the cells.</p>
<p>In general for the collagen blots, due to the lack of molecular weight markers, what chain/form of collagen type I are you showing here?</p>
<p>Besides the VPS33B siRNA transfected cells the authors also use CRISPR/Cas9-generated KO. The KO cells do not seem to be a clean system, as there is still a lot of mRNA produced. Were the clones sequenced to verify the KO on a genomic level? For the siRNA transfection, a control blot for efficiency would be great to estimate the effect size. To me it is not clear where the endocytosed collagen and VPS33B eventually meet in the cells and whether they interact. Or is ITGA11 required to mediate this process, in case VPS33B is not reaching the lumen?</p>
<p>The authors show an upregulation of ITGA11 and VPS33B in IPF patients-derived fibroblasts, which can be correlated to an increased level of ColI uptake, however, it is not clear whether this increased uptake in those cells is due to the elevated levels of VPS33B and/or ITGA11.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Chang et al. investigated the mechanisms governing collagen fibrillogenesis, firstly demonstrating that cells within tail tendons are able to uptake exogenous collagen and use this to synthesize new collagen-1 fibrils. Using an endocytic inhibitor, the authors next showed that endocytosis was required for collagen fibrillogenesis and that this process occurs in a circadian rhythmic manner. Using knockdown and overexpression assays, it was then demonstrated that collagen fibril formation is controlled by vacuolar protein sorting 33b (VPS33b), and this VPS33b-dependent fibrillogenesis is mediated via Integrin alpha-11 (ITGA11). Finally, the authors demonstrated increased expression of VPS33b and ITGA11 at the gene level in fibroblasts from patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), and greater expression of these proteins in both lung samples from IPF patients and in chronic skin wounds, indicating that endocytic recycling is disrupted in fibrotic diseases.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors have performed a comprehensive functional analysis of the regulators of endocytic recycling of collagen, providing compelling evidence that VPS33b and ITGA11 are crucial regulators of this process.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Throughout the study, several different cell types have been used (immortalised tail tendon fibroblasts, NIHT3T cells, and HEK293T cells). In general, it is not clear which cells have been used for a particular experiment, and the rationale for using these different cell types is not explained. In addition, some experimental details are missing from the methods.</p>
<p>There is also a lack of functional studies in patient-derived IPF fibroblasts which means the link between endocytic recycling of collagen and the role of VPS33b and ITGA11 cannot be fully established.</p>
