<title>Abstract</title><p>Dormancy in cancer is a clinical state in which residual disease remains undetectable for a prolonged duration. At a cellular level, rare cancer cells cease proliferation and survive chemotherapy and disseminate disease. We created a suspension culture model of high grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) dormancy and devised a novel CRISPR screening approach to identify survival genes in this context. In combination with RNA-seq, we discovered the Netrin signaling pathway as critical to dormant HGSOC cell survival. We demonstrate that Netrin-1, -3, and its receptors are essential for low level ERK activation to promote survival, and that Netrin activation of ERK is unable to induce proliferation. Deletion of all UNC5 family receptors blocks Netrin signaling in HGSOC cells and compromises viability during the dormancy step of dissemination in xenograft assays. Furthermore, we demonstrate that Netrin-1 and -3 overexpression in HGSOC correlates with poor outcome. Specifically, our experiments reveal that Netrin overexpression elevates cell survival in dormant culture conditions and contributes to greater spread of disease in a xenograft model of abdominal dissemination. This study highlights Netrin signaling as a key mediator HGSOC cancer cell dormancy and metastasis.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Relapse from initially effective cancer treatment represents one of the greatest barriers to improving outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>). Dormant or minimal residual disease that is not clinically detectable is a common source of relapse, particularly in a metastatic setting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>). This has motivated the search for, and study of, disseminated cancer cells. Cellular dormancy has been characterized in cancer cells derived from a variety of primary disease sites including breast, prostate, melanoma, and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>). Disseminated cells often occupy specific cellular niches in perivascular space or in bone marrow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>). They adopt catabolic metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>), and withdraw from the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>). Stem like phenotypes and epithelial to mesenchymal transition also characterize the biology of these cells as they survive dissemination and lay quiescent in distant tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>). Across a variety of disease sites this dormant state is characterized by diminished Ras-MAPK signaling and elevated p38 activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>). To develop treatments specifically tailored for dormant cells, a systematic search for vulnerabilities unique to dormancy is needed. To this end, high grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) disseminates in ascites as growth arrested cellular aggregates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>). This has been modeled in culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>), and studies confirm active induction of cell cycle arrest mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>), induction of autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>), and other known characteristics of dormancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>). This suggests that HGSOC spheroids are ideal to search for survival dependencies specific to dormant cells.</p>
<p>High grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) is the deadliest gynecologic malignancy, accounting for more than 70% of cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>). Its poor prognosis is largely attributed to late-stage diagnosis with metastases already present. Metastatic spread is facilitated by multicellular clusters of tumor cells, called spheroids, that are shed into the peritoneal cavity and disseminate to nearby organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>). The non-proliferative state of spheroid cells renders them chemoresistant and contributes to disease recurrence, emphasizing the need to understand the biology of these cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>). Dormant HGSOC cells are characterized by similar metabolic changes, EMT, and cytokine signaling as dormant cancer cells from other disease sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>). Mechanisms that mediate their dormant properties include AMPK-LKB1 signaling that induces autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>), STAT3 and FAK for survival and chemoresistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>), and DYRK1A signaling to arrest proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>). Unfortunately, therapeutic approaches to target these pathways in ovarian cancer have yet to emerge, indicating that more candidates are needed.</p>
<p>Netrins are a family of secreted factors that reside in the extracellular matrix and were first identified in axon guidance in the developing nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>). Together with their receptors, Netrins have since been implicated in cancer progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>). Netrin-1 is the most studied and its misregulation in cancer leads to pro-survival signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>). Netrin interactions with DCC and UNC5 homologs (UNC5H, UNC5A-D) convert pro-death signals by these dependence receptors to survival signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>). Netrin signals through PI3K-AKT and ERK-MAPK are known to participate in orientation decisions in development by providing guidance cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>), while loss of ligand binding leads DCC or UNC5H to stimulate dephosphorylation of DAPK1 that sends pro-death signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>). The gene encoding DCC is frequently deleted in cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>), and Netrin-1 blocking antibodies are in Phase II clinical trials for endometrial and cervical carcinomas to inhibit metastatic growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>). Alternative receptors for Netrins such as NEO, DSCAM, and Integrins also mediate their signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>), creating a myriad of possible pathways for Netrins to regulate cancer cells. Lastly, functional roles for Netrin-3, -4, and -5 are still relatively unexplored compared to Netrin-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>), although their expression patterns suggest roles in advanced forms of some cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>). A functional role for Netrins and their receptors in dormancy, or other aspects of HGSOC spheroid biology have yet to be reported.</p>
<p>In this study we utilized a suspension culture system to interrogate survival mechanisms in dormancy using HGSOC spheroids. To maximize discovery of gene loss events that compromise viability in dormancy, we devised a novel genome-wide CRISPR screen approach that we term ‘GO-CRISPR’. In addition to the standard CRISPR workflow, GO-CRISPR utilizes a parallel screen in which ‘guide-only’ cells lacking Cas9 are used to control for stochastic changes in gRNA abundance in non-proliferative cells. This screen identified multiple Netrin ligands, DCC, UNC5Hs, and downstream MAPK signaling components as supporting survival of HGSOC cells in dormant culture conditions. A transcriptomic analysis of HGSOC spheroids also revealed Netrin signaling components were enriched in HGSOC spheroids compared to adherent cells, and that in the absence of the DYRK1A survival kinase Netrin transcriptional increases were lost. We show that multiple Netrins, UNC5 receptors, and the downstream MEK-ERK axis is crucial for survival signaling in dormant cell culture. Importantly, Netrin activation of ERK is restricted to spheroid cultures and is unable to stimulate proliferation, consistent with its role in dormant survival. We blocked Netrin signaling by deleting UNC5 receptors and using xenograft approaches demonstrated that loss of Netrin signaling compromises survival of HGSOC cells, specifically in the dormant stage of dissemination. Furthermore, we show that overexpression of Netrin-1 and -3 are associated with poor prognosis in HGSOC and their overexpression in culture increases survival in suspension culture. Netrin overexpression in xenografts contributes to increased disease dissemination in a model of metastasis. Our study highlights Netrin-ERK signaling as a requirement for spheroid survival and suggests it may be a potential therapeutic target for eradicating dormant HGSOC cells.</p>

<title>Axon guidance genes are essential factors for HGSOC spheroid viability</title>
<p>To dissect genetic dependencies of dormant ovarian cancer cells, we utilized a suspension culture system that encourages cellular aggregation, leading to non-proliferative spheroids that resemble dormant aggregates found in ovarian cancer patient ascites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>). <bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref></bold> illustrates withdrawal from cellular proliferation by HGSOC cells in suspension as evidenced by reduced expression of Ki67 and increased expression of the quiescence marker p130 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>). Furthermore, phospho-western blots for ERK demonstrate reduced but not absent phosphorylation, and phospho-p38 either remains consistent or is increased. Reduced phospho-ERK and elevated phospho-p38 are indicative of the characteristic signaling switch reported to underlie most paradigms of cancer cell dormancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>). These findings are relatively consistent among the three HGSOC cell lines; iOvCa147, OVCAR8, TOV1946 selected for use in our screen. To discover genes required for survival in spheroids, we utilized a new approach called GO-CRISPR (Guide Only CRISPR) that we developed specifically for survival gene discovery in three-dimensional spheroid cell culture conditions (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref></bold>). GO-CRISPR incorporates sgRNA abundances from non-Cas9-expressing cells to control for stochastic (non-Cas9 dependent) effects that are a challenge in three-dimensional culture conditions with slow or arrested proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>). We used sequencing to determine sgRNA identity and abundance in the library, initially infected cells, and in cells following 48 hours of suspension culture (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref></bold>). Read count data was analyzed using a software package that we developed to analyze GO-CRISPR data (summarized in <bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> - <xref rid="fig1-1" ref-type="fig">Fig. Sup. 1A&amp;B</xref></bold>). We selected genes that had a Spheroid/Adherent Enrichment Ratio (ER) less than 1 (<italic>P</italic>&lt;0.05) because some genes become depleted in adherent growth before being transferred to suspension culture conditions and this ratio selects for genes with a stronger effect in suspension when cells are not proliferating (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref></bold>). To assess reliability of screen data, we investigated the classification of non-targeting control sgRNAs. We computed a receiver operator characteristic curve (ROC) and determined the area under the curve for each cell line (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> - <xref rid="fig1-1" ref-type="fig">Fig. Sup. 1C</xref></bold>). Greater than 95% of sgRNAs in iOVCA147 and OVCAR8 screens were classified as non-essential, while 83% of sgRNAs in TOV1946 cells were non-essential. In addition, we compared GO-CRISPR screen ER values with viability data from siRNA knock down for 35 individual genes we have previously studied in spheroid survival assays in OVCAR8 and iOVCA147 cells (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> - <xref rid="fig1-1" ref-type="fig">Fig. Sup. 1D</xref></bold>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>). This revealed a statistically significant correlation between the two sets of data, suggesting that genes we previously knew supported spheroid viability (or were dispensable) were classified similarly by our screen. These controls suggested our screen data was reliable for identifying new survival dependencies.</p>

<p>DYRK1A was previously discovered to support survival of ovarian cancer cells in suspension culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>).

<p>We compared enriched pathways from these two RNA-seq analyses with those that were identified in our GO-CRISPR screens to identify gene expression programs in spheroids whose products are essential for cell survival. 78 Reactome pathways were commonly enriched across the GO-CRISPR screens and transcriptomic analyses, including 78 of the 83 pathways identified in RNA-seq from <italic>DYRK1A<sup>-/-</sup></italic> spheroid cells (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref></bold>). The axon guidance pathway was one of the most enriched among these common pathways (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2F</xref></bold>). These data reveal that our GO-CRISPR screen and transcriptomic analyses converge on this highly specific tertiary Reactome category of axon guidance alongside much broader primary or secondary gene sets. This category includes Netrin ligands, receptors, and downstream signaling components, suggesting a previously unappreciated role in HGSOC spheroid viability.</p>
<p>We separately sought to confirm elevated expression of Netrins and some of their signaling components in HGSOC spheroid cell culture. We examined expression levels of ligands and receptors in the three cell lines used in our GO-CRISPR screen using RT-qPCR (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A-C</xref></bold>). The precise identities of upregulated genes varies between cell lines, however each cell line increases expression of some Netrins, at least one UNC5, and at least one of DCC, DSCAM, and Neogenin. This suggests that the Netrin pathway components are expressed in HGSOC cells may play a previously unappreciated role in dormancy and disease progression.</p>

<p>Since Netrin signaling has not been previously associated with dormancy we examined expression of Netrin-1 and -3 ligands in spheroids isolated directly from patient ascites by immunohistochemistry. First, we assessed proliferative markers in HGSOC tumor tissue and spheroids by staining for Ki67 and p130. As expected, solid HGSOC tumors display uniform Ki67 positivity and relative absence of p130 (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A-B</xref></bold>). Conversely, serial sections of spheroids demonstrated rare Ki67 nuclear staining and abundant and uniform p130 staining. This indicates that cells in these patient derived spheroids are quiescent (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C-E</xref></bold>). To investigate the presence of Netrins, we initially tested Netrin-1 and -3 antibody specificity using spheroids generated from OVCAR8 cells bearing knock out or over expression of Netrins (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> - <xref rid="fig1-1" ref-type="fig">Fig. Sup. 1A-F</xref></bold>). Dormant patient derived spheroids were stained for Netrins and epithelial markers Cytokeratin and EpCAM. Since HGSOC is characterized by point mutations in p53 and its accumulation in the nucleus, sections were also stained for p53 to confirm cancer cell identity within these spheroids by high level nuclear staining (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4F-H</xref></bold>). Overall, this confirms Netrin expression occurs in dormant HGSOC patient spheroids, precisely the context our screen indicates that they are critical for cell survival.</p>

<title>Netrin signaling stimulates ERK to support HGSOC spheroid survival</title>

To confirm screen findings, we independently knocked out <italic>NTN1</italic>, <italic>NTN3</italic>, <italic>NTN4</italic>, <italic>NTN5</italic>, the UNC5H receptor homologs (<italic>UNC5A</italic>, <italic>UNC5B</italic>, <italic>UNC5C</italic>, and <italic>UNC5D</italic>), as well as <italic>DCC</italic>, <italic>DSCAM</italic>, and <italic>NEO1</italic> alone or in multigene combinations using lentiviral delivery of sgRNAs and Cas9 (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> - <xref rid="fig1-1" ref-type="fig">Fig. Sup. 1A-C</xref></bold>). We assessed the effect of their loss on spheroid survival in six HGSOC cell lines (iOvCa147, TOV1946, OVCAR3, OVCAR4, OVCAR8, and COV318). Loss of at least one Netrin ligand resulted in reduced spheroid cell survival in five of six cell lines (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref></bold>). Notably, Netrin-3 loss showed the most pronounced effect on survival. Cell lines such as OVCAR8 and COV318 were relatively resistant to the deletion of Netrin pathway components as individual UNC5, <italic>DCC</italic>, and <italic>DSCAM</italic> genes rarely affected viability (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref></bold>). In these instances, combined deletions of UNC5 family members, or <italic>DCC;DSCAM;NEO1</italic> (DDN for short) were either inviable or highly sensitive to suspension culture induced cell death, suggesting redundancy in this pathway in some cell lines. Other cell lines, such as OVCAR3, were highly sensitive to the loss of multiple individual ligands and any individual UNC5H receptor was highly sensitizing to death induction in suspension (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref></bold>). Overall, these illustrate a robust role for Netrins in survival in this dormant cell culture assay. Importantly, loss of receptor expression does not elevate viability as expected for a dependence receptors, nor does it induce DAPK1 dephosphorylation (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> - <xref rid="fig1-1" ref-type="fig">Fig. Sup. 1D</xref></bold>), suggesting that Netrin receptors in HGSOC spheroids transmit positive survival signals.</p>

<p>To determine if Netrin dependent signaling is active in HGSOC spheroids, we stimulated cells in suspension with recombinant Netrin-1 (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref></bold>). Western blotting for phospho-ERK, as a measure of activation, revealed stimulation of MEK-ERK signaling in each of the cell lines tested. Because MAPK signaling is best known for its role in proliferation, we also tested Netrin-1 stimulation of quiescent, adherent cells and compared this with stimulation in spheroid culture. Both conditions display similar, low levels of phospho-ERK, but Netrin-1 was only able to stimulate ERK phosphorylation in suspension (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D</xref></bold>). Importantly, stimulation of adherent cells with an equivalent concentration of EGF induced pERK levels commonly seen in proliferating cells. Collectively, the context and magnitude of pERK stimulation by Netrin-1 is inconsistent with proliferative signaling, suggesting it may contribute to survival. This suggested that Netrin is a candidate pathway to provide low level, but essential survival signals through the MAPK pathway in dormant spheroids. We investigated the dependence of ERK phosphorylation on UNC5H and DDN receptors and discovered that it is lower when receptors are deleted (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5E</xref></bold>). Furthermore, Netrin-1 stimulation of suspension cultures of OVCAR8 cells, or derivatives deleted for UNC5 family members or DDN receptors, indicated that Netrin receptors are essential to activate ERK in suspension culture (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5F</xref></bold>). To confirm that Netrin-MEK-ERK signaling contributes to survival in suspension culture, we used two different MEK inhibitors, PD184352 and Trametinib, to treat OVCAR8 suspension cultures and observed that it causes loss of cell viability in suspension culture (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5G</xref></bold>). Since we routinely use reattachment of spheroids to adherent plastic as a test of viability, also tested viability using trypan blue dye exclusion to confirm that Trametinib is truly killing cells in suspension and it revealed the same conclusion (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5H</xref></bold>). As expected, treatment of cells in suspension with Trametinib lead to lower phospho-ERK levels (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5I</xref></bold>). The simplest explanation of this data is that Netrins signal through a heterodimer or multi-receptor complex containing both an UNC5 and DDN component that provides low level stimulation for MEK and ERK specifically in dormant culture conditions.</p>

<title>Netrin signaling is essential for dormant spheroid survival during metastatic dissemination</title>
<p>To investigate the role of Netrin signaling in the context of residual disease and relapse, we xenografted mice with control OVCAR8L cells, or UNC5 4KO cells, by intraperitoneal injection (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref></bold>). Two weeks following injection, mice were euthanized, and spheroids were obtained by washing the abdominal cavity with PBS. Importantly, at this early stage of engraftment, solid tumor lesions were not yet observable, indicating that we are modeling minimal residual disease where dormancy is most relevant. Extraction of RNA from control OVCAR8 cell spheroids recovered at this time point indicates a reduction in expression of pro-proliferative genes compared to the same cells prior to engraftment (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref></bold>). Furthermore, comparison with RT-qPCR measurements of these same markers in suspension culture induced OVCAR8 spheroids indicates that spheroids from abdominal washes are equivalently withdrawn from the cell cycle (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>, - <xref rid="fig1-1" ref-type="fig">Fig. Sup. 1</xref></bold>). This suggests spheroids at this stage are dormant. Furthermore, recovery of spheroids by replating on adherent plastic indicates that deletion of UNC5 receptors to block Netrin signaling extensively reduces survival under these circumstances (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C</xref></bold>). We also quantitated cancer cells in these abdominal washes by qPCR using human Alu repeat detection to count cells and this also demonstrates that cancer cell abundance is reduced in this dormant state by loss of UNC5 receptors. Further xenografts were performed to investigate the long term consequences of reduced survival of UNC5 4KO cells in mice. This demonstrated that mice engrafted with UNC5 4KO cells had a considerably longer survival than control OVCAR8 recipient mice that received the same number of cells (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6E,F</xref></bold>). Collectively, this demonstrates that inhibition of Netrin signaling compromises viability and eventual disease progression in a model of dormancy and dissemination.</p>

<title>Netrin overexpression is correlated with poor outcomes in HGSOC</title>
<p>Genomic studies indicate that HGSOC is one of the most aneuploid cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>). In addition to the frequency of copy number variants per tumor, the locations of gains and losses are dissimilar between cases, making this a highly heterogenous disease. Evaluation of TCGA genomic data for HGSOC indicates rare amplifications or deletions of Netrin or Netrin-receptor genes (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref> - <xref rid="fig1-1" ref-type="fig">Fig. Sup. 1A</xref></bold>). Because of redundancy of Netrins and their receptor families this data suggests HGSOC cases with deficiency for Netrin signaling are rare. This is consistent with our data that all six cell lines tested reveal evidence of Netrin component dependence for survival (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref></bold>). Some TCGA HGSOC cases display elevated gene expression for Netrins or their receptors, but only rare cases display low expression (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref> - <xref rid="fig1-1" ref-type="fig">Fig. Sup. 1B</xref></bold>).

<p>In agreement with our experimental data that multiple Netrin ligands can contribute to spheroid survival in HGSOC (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A&amp;B</xref></bold>), sorting cases by high level expression of Netrin-1 and -3 ligands reveals a significantly shorter overall survival compared to cases with low level expression and this trend is also evident in the cases that only overexpress Netrin-3 (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7A</xref></bold>). This genomic data supports the interpretation that Netrin signaling is retained in HGSOC and its elevation is deleterious to patient outcome.</p>
<p>We investigated overexpression of Netrin-1 and -3 in spheroid survival by generating OVCAR8 derivatives that stably overexpress these proteins (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7B</xref></bold>). We then utilized these cells in suspension culture assays for spheroid survival as before (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7C</xref></bold>). This data indicates that overexpression of either Netrin-1 or -3 increases OVCAR8 cell survival in dormant spheroid culture conditions. Examination of fixed spheroids isolated from this experiment further indicates that elevated survival in this experiment is explained by an increase in abundance of individual spheroids that overexpress either Netrin-1 or -3 (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7D</xref></bold>). These experiments reveal the significance of a previously undiscovered role for Netrins in HGSOC. High level expression correlates with poor outcome and in suspension culture, overexpression confers oncogenic properties on HGSOC cells.</p>

<p>Our findings from CRISPR screens and cell culture experiments indicate that Netrin signaling supports dormant HGSOC cell survival. Our analysis of TCGA is also predictive of a worse outcome for patients. We sought to solidify these findings by searching for how Netrin signaling affects HGSOC disease pathogenesis.</p>
<p>We utilized a xenograft assay in which OVCAR8 cells overexpressing Netrin-1 or -3 were injected into the peritoneal cavity and compared with OVCAR8 cells bearing an empty vector as control. Mice were harvested following 35 days to analyze disease dissemination and characterize the effect of Netrins in this model of HGSOC metastatic spread (<bold><xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8A</xref></bold>). Necropsy of all animals at endpoint allowed for the identification and quantitation of tumor nodules within the abdomen (<bold><xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8B</xref></bold>). Petal plots illustrate the frequency of specific organ and tissue sites displaying tumor nodules (<bold><xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8B</xref></bold>). This revealed that spread to the omentum was similar across all genotypes of xenografted cells and it occurred in all mice (<bold><xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8B</xref></bold>). In contrast, tumor nodules were detected with increased abundance on the diaphragm, the liver, and mesenteries that support the uterus (mesometrium) (<bold><xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8B</xref></bold>). In addition to more frequent disease spread to these locations caused by Netrin overexpressing cells, we note that the quantity of nodules was also increase in comparison with OVCAR8 control cells (<bold><xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8C-F</xref></bold>). We confirmed the source of these lesions to be the xenografted cells using immunohistochemical staining for human cytokeratin (<bold><xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8G,H</xref></bold>). Lastly, Netrin-1 and -3 histochemical staining confirms its presence in the local tumor microenvironment (<bold><xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8G,H</xref></bold>). The similarity of increased tumor nodules seen in xenografts and elevated spheroid formation and viability seen in culture suggests that Netrin signaling improves cell viability in spheroid aggregates in vivo leading to increased disease spread.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this report we investigated survival mechanisms in a model of HGSOC dormancy. We utilized a modified CRISPR screening approach that was adapted to discover gene loss events in largely non-proliferative conditions. We compared essential genes discovered in the screen with gene expression increases identified by RNA-seq in dormant HGSOC cultures. This implicated the Netrin signaling pathway in HGSOC spheroid survival. We independently validated the role of Netrins, their receptors, and downstream intracellular targets MEK and ERK in the survival biology of HGSOC cells in dormant culture and in vivo in xenografts. Furthermore, we reveal that overexpression of Netrin-1 and -3 are correlated with poor clinical outcome in HGSOC and over expression of these ligands induces elevated survival in dormant HGSOC culture conditions and increased disease spread in a xenograft model of dissemination. Our work implicates Netrins, their receptors, and MEK-ERK as a previously unappreciated, but critical signaling network in HGSOC survival.</p>
<p>HGSOC spheroid cell biology has presented a unique challenge to cancer chemotherapy. Dormant spheroids are most abundant in patients with late-stage disease and they contribute to therapeutic resistance and seed metastases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>). Hence, there is a critical unmet need to understand HGSOC spheroid dependencies and target them therapeutically. Our data suggests that Netrin signaling is a universally active mechanism in spheroid cell survival. HGSOC is characterized by extensive genomic rearrangements and copy number variants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>), and we speculate that Netrin signaling is retained because of the extensive redundancy of components of this pathway. Netrin-1 and -3 can both contribute to survival signaling and knock out of three or four different Netrin receptors is necessary to compromise Netrin signaling in survival. A key goal for the future is to identify Netrin-1 or -3 overexpression patients and compare their specific disease progression patterns with our xenograft model. This will be most informative of the effects of Netrin ligand overexpression in scenarios of dormancy, metastasis, and chemotherapy resistance.</p>
<p>This study demonstrates that Netrins function to stimulate UNC5H and fibronectin repeat containing receptors such as DCC to activate survival signals in HGSOC spheroids. This is distinct from the known role of UNC5H and DCC as dependence receptors where Netrin inhibits their pro-apoptotic signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>). Our data does not show elevated survival of spheroid cells in response to deletions of receptors, even in instances where families of Netrin receptors are co-deleted. Consistent with this observation, over expression of Netrin-1 or -3 in OVCAR8 cells stimulates higher level survival in suspension. In colon cancer, deletion of DCC confers a survival advantage and underscores the dependence receptor concept (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>). In HGSOC DCC or UNC5H deletions are relatively rare (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>). This suggests that ovarian cancer cells utilize Netrin signals for positive survival signaling instead of to neutralize inherent death signals from dependence receptors. Our data suggests that Netrin activates MEK and ERK to support cell survival indicating that targeting ligands, receptors or downstream at MEK are all possible approaches to inhibit this survival pathway. Netrin-1 inhibition in solid tumor xenograft models of melanoma have been shown to be effective in combination with chemotherapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>), but its effects on a dormant scenario are unknown. Identifying agents that cooperate with standard HGSOC chemotherapeutic agents such as carboplatin would offer an attractive strategy to eradicate dormant cells while combating progressive disease. Alternatively, a novel approach to targeting dormancy discovered in this study is, ironically, MEK inhibition. While MAPK signaling in cancer is universally known for its role in proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>), and MEK inhibitors are used to block proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>), it is noteworthy that Netrin stimulation of MAPK signaling is reported to provide survival signals and to guide axon outgrowth in a non-proliferative context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>). Dormancy is characterized by low phospho-ERK levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>), indicating low MEK activity, however low levels of RAS-MAPK signaling are known to provide survival signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>). A challenge with deploying MEK inhibitors as an anti-dormancy setting in HGSOC therapy is its incompatibility with standard chemotherapies that rely on cell proliferation. Overall, our study aimed to identify potential new therapeutic targets in dormancy and Netrins and MEK are potential new candidates for dormant HGSOC disease.</p>
<p>Current literature offers little to connect Netrins with HGSOC beyond the observation that <italic>NTN1</italic> expression is increased in tumors compared to benign lesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>). Similarly, dormancy literature does not include a role for Netrins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>). However, we expect that Netrin signaling may play an unappreciated role in dormancy in other cancer disease site paradigms. As stated in the introduction, dormancy is characterized by acquisition of stem like properties, EMT, and in most paradigms it involves rare cells establishing themselves in perivascular or bone marrow niches and Netrins have also been implicated in these processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>). Inhibition of Netrin-1 with NP137 and treatment with decitabine has been shown to reduce lung seeding suggesting that Netrins are relevant in a metastatic scenario that may include dormant intermediate steps in dissemination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>). Furthermore, Netrin signaling through UNC5B is known to direct vascular branching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>). This suggests that Netrins are available in the perivascular niche where dormant cells often reside. Lastly, Netrin-1 has been shown to be a component of the bone marrow niche that suppresses hematopoietic stem cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>). While not a cancer dormancy scenario, it indicates that Netrins support some solitary dormant cell properties and are expressed by resident cells in the appropriate dormant cell niches beyond just HGSOC. For these reasons we expect Netrins will have a significant role in tumor dormancy beyond ovarian cancer.</p>

Triplicate samples of 6.2 × 10<sup>7</sup> cells were saved for sgRNA sequence quantitation (T<sub>0</sub>). The remaining cells were seeded at 2.0 × 10<sup>6</sup> cells/mL in 20 x 10 cm ULA plates. Following 2 days of culture, media containing spheroids was transferred to 10 x 15 cm adherent tissue culture plates. The next day unattached spheroid cells were collected and re-plated onto additional 15 cm plates. This process was repeated for a total of 5 days to maximally capture viable cells. Attached cells were collected and pooled for DNA extraction (T<sub>f</sub>). Genomic DNA was extracted using the QIAmp DNA Blood Maxi Kit (Qiagen, #51194). PCR amplification and barcoding performed as described (Hart paper, Cell, 2015) using NEBNext Q5 Ultra mastermix (NEB, # MO544).

For individual gene knockouts pooled libraries of up to four sgRNAs were generated. For multiple gene knockouts pooled libraries of two sgRNAs/gene were constructed. To each 20-nucleotide guide (Supplemental table I) was appended the 5’ sequence, 5’-TATCTTGTGGAAAGGACGAAACACC-3’ and the 3’ sequence, 5’-GTTTTAGAGCTAGAAATAGCAAGTTAAAAT-3’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref>).

Supernatant containing viral particles was filtered through a low protein binding 0.45 µM filter. For each knockout, it was important to ensure that each target cell was transduced with a full complement of guides. To ensure this, the cells were transduced at relatively high MOI. Briefly, 25,000 cells were plated and transduced with fresh HEK293T conditioned media containing virus. While we did not titer the viral preparations for these experiments, previous experience indicated that we could generate sufficiently high virus titers using our protocol. Under these conditions, we found a lack of puromycin sensitive cells following 2-3 days in media containing 2-4 μg/ml puromycin indicating that every cell received at least one virus particle. Multi-gene knock outs were created through multiple rounds of infection with the relevant culture supernatants followed by one round of puromycin selection.</p>

<p>In this article, the authors employed modified CRISPR screens [&quot;guide-only (GO)-CRISPR&quot;] in the attempt to identify the genes which may mediate cancer cell dormancy in the high grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) spheroid culture models. Using this approach, they observed that abrogation of several of the components of the netrin (e.g., DCC, UNC5Hs) and MAPK pathways compromise survival of non-proliferative ovarian cancer cells. This strategy was complemented by the RNAseq approach which revealed that number of the components of the netrin pathway are upregulated in non-proliferative ovarian cancer cells, and that their overexpression is lost upon disruption of DYRK1A kinase that has been previously demonstrated to play a major role in survival of these cells. Perampalam et al. then employed a battery of cell biology approaches to support the model whereby the Netrin signaling governs the MEK-ERK axis to support survival of non-proliferative ovarian cancer cells. Moreover, the authors show that overexpression of Netrins 1 and 3 bolsters dissemination of ovarian cancer cells in the xenograft mouse model, while also providing evidence that high levels of the aforementioned factors are associated with poor prognosis of HGSOC patients.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>In this valuable study Perampalam et al. developed a CRISPR-based screening approach to identify key genes that are enriched in high grade serous ovarian cancer spheroids. This led to a discovery that Netrin signaling plays a prominent role in survival of ovarian cancer cells. During revision, the authors provide additional evidence to support their central claims and to this end, it was found that they now provide solid evidence to substantiate the proposed model. This work is anticipated to be of interest to cancer biologists specializing in ovarian cancer biology.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Perampalam et al. describe novel methods for genome-wide CRISPR screening to identify and validate genes essential for HGSOC spheroid viability. In this study, they report that Netrin signaling is essential for maintaining disseminated cancer spheroid survival, wherein overexpression of Netrin pathway genes increases tumor burden in a xenograft model of ovarian cancer. They also show that high netrin expression correlates with poor survival outcomes in ovarian cancer patients. The study provides insights into the biology of netrin signaling in DTC cluster survival and warrants development of therapies to block netrin signaling for treating serous ovarian cancer.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>- The study identifies Netrin signaling to be important in disseminated cancer spheroid survival</p>
<p>- A Novel GO-CRISPR methodology was used to find key genes and pathways essential for disseminated cancer cell survival</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks for the endorsement of our work and its importance to metastasis in ovarian cancer.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>- The term dormancy is not fully validated and requires additional confirmation to claim the importance of Netrin signaling in &quot;dormant&quot; cancer survival.</p>
<p>- Findings shown in the study largely relate to cancer dissemination and DTS survival rather than cancer dormancy.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Much of the validation of dormancy and cell cycle arrest in HGSOC spheroids, as well as the culture model, have been published previously and hence was not repeated here.  I think this reviewer will appreciate the updated citations and explanations to better illustrate the state of knowledge.  We have also added new experiments that further emphasize the dormant state of spheroid cells in culture and xenografts, as well as patient derived spheroids used in this study.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for Authors):</bold></p>
<p>(1) It is unclear what spheroid/adherent enrichment ratio is and how it ties into genes affecting cell viability. Why is an ER below 1 the criteria for selecting survival genes?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Our screen uses the ‘guide only’ comparison in each culture condition to establish a gene score under that specific condition.  A low adherent score captures genes that are essential under standard culture conditions where cells are proliferating and this can include genes needed for proliferation or other basic functions in cell physiology.  A low spheroid score identifies the genes that are most depleted in suspension when cells are growth arrested and this is an indication of cell death in this condition.  Since gene knock outs are first established in adherent proliferating conditions, essential genes under these conditions will already start to become depleted from the population before suspension culture.  By selecting genes with a ratio of &lt;1 we can identify those that are most relevant to dormant suspension culture conditions.  Ultimately, the lowest enrichment ratio scores represent genes whose loss of function is dispensable in the initial adherent condition, but critical for survival in suspension and this is what we aimed to identify. We’ve updated Figure 1B to illustrate this and we’ve updated the explanation of the enrichment ratio on page 6, lines 144 to 147 of the results.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) The WB for phospho-p38 in figure 1A for OVCAR8 line does not show increased phosphorylation in the spheroid relative to the adherent. If anything, phospho-p38 appears to be reduced in the spheroid. Can the authors provide a better western blot?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We’ve updated this blot with a longer exposure, see Figure 1A.  Phosphorylation levels of p38 are essentially unchanged in OVCAR8 cells in suspension culture, although the overall levels of p38 may be slightly reduced in dormant culture conditions.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) How did the authors confirm dormancy apart from western blot for phospho-ERK vs phospho-p38? Authors should add EdU/BrdU staining and/or Ki67 staining to confirm dormancy.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Previous publications that appear as citations 7,10, and 33 in the reference list established the growth arrest state of these cells in suspension culture in the past.  This included measuring other known markers of dormancy and quiescence such as p27, p130, and reduced cyclin/cdk activity and 3H-thymidine incorporation. In addition, other associated characteristics of dormancy such as EMT and catabolic metabolism have been demonstrated in these culture conditions (see citation 11 and Rafehi et al. Endocr. Relat. Cancer 23;147-59).  We’ve added these additional citations to our descriptions of dormant spheroid culture to better clarify the status of these cells in our experiments (see page 6, lines 126-28).  To ensure that cells are growth arrested in the experiments shown in this paper, we have updated Figure 1A to include blots of p130 and Ki67 to further emphasize that spheroid cells are not proliferating as the quiescence marker (p130) is high and the proliferative marker (Ki67) is lost in suspension culture.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) Can the authors report spheroid volume over time in culture? How was viability measured?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We’ve updated the methods (see page 27, line 574) to better highlight the description of cell survival that answers both of these questions. At the ends of experimental time points in both the screen and viability assays we captured live cells by replating on adherent plasticware. We fixed and stained with crystal violet and photographed plates to illustrate the sizes of spheroids (shown in Fig. 2 Supplement 1E, Fig. 6C, and 7D). We subsequently extracted the dye and quantitated it spectrophotometrically to quantitatively compare biomass of viable cells between experiments irrespective of the relatively random shapes of spheroids. We found reattachment and staining in this manner to match traditional viability assays such as CellTiter-Glo in a previous paper (10). Furthermore, biomass never increases in culture and diminishes gradually over time in culture consistent with the non-proliferative state of these experiments. Double checks of this equivalency of viability and reattached biomass measurments, as well as demonstrating that biomass is lost over time, are shown in Fig. 2 Supplement 1E that compares reattached crystal violet staining measurements with CellTiter-Glo for DYRK1A knock out cells over time in culture. In addition, we include a comparison of crystal violet staining of reattached spheroids with trypan blue dye exclusion in Fig. 5G and H. In both cases reattachment and more direct viability assays demonstrate the same conclusion that Netrin signaling supports viability in dormant culture.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) Please show survival significance of Netrin signaling genes in recurrence/relapse free survival to claim importance in cancer dormancy.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>See Fig. 7 Supplement 1C where we include the recurrence free survival data. Netrin-1, and -3 high expressors also have a numerically shorter progression free survival but it is not statistically significant. Netrin-1 overexpression alone is also shown and it shows shorter survival with a P-value of 0.0735. Elevated survival of dormant cells in a residual disease state is expected to increase the chance of relapse and shorten this interval. Thus, this data is consistent with our model, but lacks statistical significance.</p>
<p>There are many alternative ways to interpret what shorter progression free survival, or overall survival, may mean biologically. Since survival of dormant cells is but one of them, we also added new data to experimentally investigate the role of endogenous Netrin signaling in dormant residual disease in Fig. 6 and described on page 12, lines 266-87.  We used xenograft experiments to show OVCAR8 spheroids form and withdraw from the cell cycle equivalently to suspension culture following intraperitoneal injection.  Furthermore, loss of Netrin signaling due to receptor deletions compromises survival during this early window before disseminated lesions form.  This argues that Netrin signaling contributes to survival during this window of dormancy.  In addition, mice engrafted with mutant cells experience prolonged survival when Netrin signaling is blocked.  Together, these experiments further argue that Netrin signaling supports survival in the dormant, non-proliferative phase, and leads to reduced survival of mice.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(6) The authors show IHC staining of patient ascites derived HGSOC spheroids. However, no marker for dormancy is shown in these spheroids. Adding Ki67 staining or phospho-ERK vs phospho-p38 would be necessary to confirm cancer dormancy.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have added new staining for Ki67 and p130 that compares these markers in HGSOC tumors where Ki67 is high and p130 is low with ascites derived spheroids where staining is the opposite. Importantly, expression of p130 is linked to cellular quiescence and is not found to accumulate in the nucleus of cells that are just transiting through G1.  This confirms that the ascites derived spheroids are dormant.  See Fig. 4A-E and described on page 9, lines 201-7.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(7) Overall, the findings are interesting in the context of cancer dissemination. There is not enough evidence for cancer dormancy and the importance of Netrin signaling in the survival of cancer dormancy. Overexpression of Netrin increases phosphorylation of ERK, leading one to expect an increase in proliferation. This suggests that Netrin breaks cancer cells out of dormancy, into a proliferative state.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have found that the discovery of Netrin activation of MEK-ERK in growth arrested cells is counterintuitive to many cancer researchers.  However, this axis exists in other paradigms of Netrin signaling in axon outgrowth that are not proliferation related (see citation 26, Forcet et al. Nature 417; 443-7 as an example).  We have added Fig. 5D and descriptions on page 11, lines 244-52 to better clarify that Netrins CAN’T induce cell proliferation through ERK.  Addition of recombinant Netrin-1 can only induce ERK phosphorylation in suspension culture conditions and not in quiescent adherent conditions.  The small magnitude of ERK phosphorylation induced by Netrin-1 in suspension compared to treating adherent, quiescent cells with the same concentration of mitogenic EGF further emphasizes that this is not a proliferative signal.  Lastly, the new xenograft experiment in Fig. 6A-D (described on page 12, lines 266-81 demonstrates the growth arrested context in which Netrin signaling in dormant spheroids leads supports viability.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(8) If authors wish to claim cancer dormancy as the premise of their study, additional confirmatory experiments are required to support their claims. Alternatively, based on the current findings of the study, it would be best to change the premise of the article to Netrin signaling in cancer dissemination and survival of disseminated cancer spheroids rather than cancer dormancy.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>I expect that this reviewer will agree that we have added more than sufficient explanations of background work on HGSOC spheroid dormancy from the literature, as well as new experiments that address their questions about dormancy in our experiments.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p><bold>Summary:</bold></p>
<p>In this article, the authors employed modified CRISPR screens [&quot;guide-only (GO)-CRISPR&quot;] in the attempt to identify the genes which may mediate cancer cell dormancy in the high grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) spheroid culture models. Using this approach, they observed that abrogation of several of the components of the netrin (e.g., DCC, UNC5Hs) and MAPK pathways compromise the survival of non-proliferative ovarian cancer cells.

<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Overall it was thought that this study is of potentially broad interest in as much as it provides previously unappreciated insights into the potential molecular underpinnings of cancer cell dormancy, which has been associated with therapy resistance, disease dissemination, and relapse as well as poor prognosis. Notwithstanding the potential limitations of cellular models in mimicking cancer cell dormancy, it was thought that the authors provided sufficient support for their model that netrin signaling drives survival of non-proliferating ovarian cancer cells and their dissemination. Collectively, it was thought that these findings hold a promise to significantly contribute to the understanding of the molecular mechanisms of cancer cell dormancy and in the long term may provide a molecular basis to address this emerging major issue in the clinical practice.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks for the kind words about the importance of our work in the broader challenges of cancer treatment.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Several issues were observed regarding methodology and data interpretation. The major concerns were related to the reliability of modelling cancer cell dormancy. To this end, it was relatively hard to appreciate how the employed spheroid model allows to distinguish between dormant and e.g., quiescent or even senescent cells. This was in contrast to solid evidence that netrin signaling stimulates abdominal dissemination of ovarian cancer cells in the mouse xenograft and their survival in organoid culture. Moreover, the role of ERK in mediating the effects of netrin signaling in the context of the survival of non-proliferative ovarian cancer cells was found to be somewhat underdeveloped.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Experiments previously published in citation 7 show that growth arrest in patient ascites derived spheroids is fully reversible and that argued against non-proliferative spheroids being a form of senescence and moved this work into the dormancy field.  We have added extensive new support for our model systems and data to address the counterintuitive aspects of MEK-ERK signaling in survival instead of proliferation.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 Recommendations for Authors</bold></p>
<p>(1) A better characterization of the spheroid model may be warranted, including staining for the markers of quiescence and senescence (including combining these markers with staining for the components of the netrin pathway)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>See Figure 1A and page 6, lines 126-36 where we have added blots for Ki67 and p130 to better emphasize the arrested proliferative state of cells in our screening conditions.  We have also added these same controls for patient ascites-derived spheroids in Figure 4 and described on page 9, lines 203-7.  One realization from this CRISPR screen, and others in our lab, is that it identifies functionally important aspects of cell physiology and not necessarily ones that are easily explored using commercially available antibodies.  Netrin-1 and -3 staining of patient derived spheroids in Fig. 4, as well as cell line spheroids stained in Fig. 4 Supplement 1 further support the relevance of this pathway in dormant cancer cells because Netrins are expressed in the right place at the right time.  The Netrin-1 stimulation experiments in Fig. 5C were originally carried out to probe HGSOC cells for functionality of Netrin receptors since we couldn’t reliably detected them by blotting or staining with available antibodies.  This demonstrates that this pathway is active in the various HGSOC cell lines we’ve used and specifically, using OVCAR8 cells, we show it is only active in suspension culture conditions.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) In figure 1A it appears that total p38 levels are reduced in some cell lines in spheroid vs. adherent culture. The authors should comment on this.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>These blots have been updated to be more clear.  Overall p38 levels may be reduced in some cell lines and when compared with activation levels of phosphorylated p38 it suggests the fraction of activated p38 is higher. OVCAR8 cells may be an exception where the overall activity level remains approximately the same.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) The authors should perhaps provide a clearer rationale for choosing to focus on the netrin signaling vs. e.g., GPCR signaling, and consider more explicit defining of &quot;primary&quot; vs. &quot;tertiary&quot; categories in Reactome gene set analysis.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We’ve updated Fig. 1E and the text on page7, lines 161-5 to illustrate which gene categories identified in the screen belong to which tiers of Reactome categories. It better visualizes why we have investigated the Axon guidance pathway that includes Netrin because it is a highly specific signaling pathway that scores similarly to the broader and less specific categories at the very top of the list. As an aside, the GPCR signaling and GPCR downstream signaling have proven to be fairly intractable categories.  As best we can tell the GPCR downstream signaling category is full of MAPK family members and likely represents some redundancy with MAPK further down.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) In figure 3A-C, including factors whose expression did not appear to change between adherent and suspension conditions may be warranted as the internal control. Figure 3D-F may benefit from some sort of quantification.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The mRNA expression levels are normalized to GAPDH as an internal control. We have updated this figure and re-plotted it as fold change relative to adherent culture cells with statistical comparisons to indicate which are significantly upregulated in suspension culture.</p>
<p>The IHC experiments are now in Fig. 4D-F and show positive staining for Netrin-1 and -3.  Netrin-3 is easiest to see, while Netrin-1 is trickier because the difference with the no primary antibody control isn’t intensity, but the tint of the DAB stain.  We had to counter stain the patient spheroids with Hematoxylin in order for the slide scanner to find the best focal plane and make image registration between sections possible.  This unfortunately makes the Netrin-1 staining rather subtle.  For cell line spheroids in the Fig. 4, Supplement 1 we didn’t need the slide scanner and show negative controls without counter stain that are much more convincing of Netrin-1 detection and reassure us that our staining detects the intended target.  We’ve updated the labels in Fig. 4 and Fig. 4, Supplement 1 for this to be more intuitive.  Unfortunately, relying on the tint of the DAB stain leaves this as a qualitative experiment.</p>

<p>- In figure 4C-E the authors show that Netrin-1 stimulation induces ERK phosphorylation whereby it is argued that this is a &quot;low-level&quot; stimulation of ERK signaling required for the survival of ovarian cells in the suspension. This is however hard to appreciate, and it was thought that having adherent cells in parallel would be helpful to wage whether this indeed is a &quot;low level&quot; ERK activity. Moreover, the authors should likely include downstream substrates of ERK (e.g., RSKs) as well as p38 in these experiments. The control experiments for the effects of PD184352 on ERK phosphorylation also appear to be warranted. Finally, performing the experiments with PD184352 in the presence of Netrin-1 stimulation would also be advantageous.</p>

<p>We have added a new Netrin-1 stimulation experiment in Fig. 4D (described on page 11, line 244-52) that shows that Netrins can only activate  very low levels of ERK phosphorylation in suspension when proliferation is arrested. Netrin-1 stimulation of quiescent adherent cells where stimulation of proliferation is possible shows that Netrins are unable to activate ERK phosphorylation in this condition.  In contrast, we also stimulate quiescent adherent OVCAR8 cells with an equal concentration of EGF (a known mitogen) to offer high level ERK phosphorylation as a side by side comparison.  I think that this offers clear evidence that Netrin signaling is inconsistent with inducing cell proliferation.  We’ve also updated citations in the introduction to include citation 26 that offers a previously reported paradigm of Netrin-ERK signaling in axon outgrowth that is a non-cancer, non-proliferative context to remind readers that Netrins utilize MEK-ERK differently.</p>
<p>We highlight Netrin-MEK-ERK signaling as key to survival for a number of reasons.  First, Netrin signaling in this paradigm does not fit the dependence receptor paradigm where loss of Netrin receptors protect against cell death.  Fig. 5B rules this out as receptor loss never offers a survival advantage, but clearly receptor deletions compromise survival in suspension culture.  Second, positive Netrin signaling is known to support survival by inactivating phosphorylation of DAPK1.  We’ve added this experiment as Fig. 5 Supplement 1D and show that loss of Netrin receptors doesn’t reduce DAPK1 phosphorylation in a time course of suspension culture.  Consequently, we conclude this isn’t the survival signal either.  Since MEK and ERK family members scored in our screen, we investigated their role in survival.  We now show two different MEK inhibitors with different inhibitory mechanisms to confirm that MEK inhibition induces cell death. In addition to the previous PD184352 inhibitor in our first submission, we’ve added Trametinib as well and this is shown in Fig. 5G.  Since it is surprising the MEK inhibition can kill instead of just arrest proliferation, we’ve also added another cell death assay in which we show trypan blue dye exclusion as a second look at survival.  This is now Fig. 5H.  Lastly, we include Trametinib inhibition of ERK phosphorylation in these assays in Fig. 5I.  While we leave open what takes place downstream of ERK, our model in Fig. 5J offers a very detailed look at the components upstream.</p>

<p>- Does inhibition of ERK prevent the abdominal spread of ovarian cancer cells? The authors may feel that this is out of the scope of the study, which I would agree with, but then the claims regarding ERK being the major mediator of the effects of netrin signaling should be perhaps slightly toned down.</p>

<p>We agree that loss of function xenograft experiments will enhance our discovery of Netrin’s role in dormancy and metastasis.  We have added a new Fig. 6 that uses xenografts with Netrin receptor deficient OVCAR8 cells (UNC5 4KO).  It demonstrates that two weeks following IP engraftment we can isolate spheroids from abdominal washes and that cells have entered a state of reduced proliferation as determined by lowered Ki67 expression as well as other proliferation inducing genes.  In the case of UNC5 4KO cells, there is significant attrition of these cells as determined by recovering spheroids in adherent culture (Fig.6C) and by Alu PCR to detect human cells in abdominal washes (Fig. 6D).  Lastly, xenografts of UNC5 4KO cells cause much less aggressive disease and significantly extend survival of these mice (Fig. 6E,F).  Not exactly the experiment that the reviewer is asking for, but a clear indication that Netrin signaling supports survival in xenograft model of dormancy.</p>

<p>- Notwithstanding that this could be deduced from figures 6D and F, it would be helpful if the number of mice used in each experimental group is clearly annotated in the corresponding figure legends. Moreover, indicating the precise statistical tests that were used in the figures would be helpful (e.g., specifying whether anova is one-way, two-way, or?)</p>

<p>We have added labels to what is now Fig. 8B to indicate the number of animals used for each genotype of cells.  We have also updated figure legends to include more details of statistical tests used in each instance.</p>
