<title>Abstract</title><p>Cardiac muscle function emerges from the coordinated contraction of sarcomeres in cardiomyocytes. Sarcomere dynamics are usually inferred from whole-cell or myofibril observations, assuming synchronized, uniform behavior. Here, we investigated how different mechanical properties of the cell environment affect contraction at both the sarcomere and cell level. Human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes with fluorescently labeled Z-bands were cultured individually on patterned elastic substrates (5 - 85 kPa). Sarcomere dynamics were precisely tracked and analyzed using SarcAsM, a machine learning algorithm we developed. Increasingly stiff substrates inhibited overall cardiomyocyte contraction, but, surprisingly, did not diminish individual sarcomere dynamics. Instead, sarcomeres competed in a tug-of-war with increasing heterogeneity, exhibiting rich dynamic phenomena such as rapid length oscillations and overextensions (popping). Statistical analysis showed that the heterogeneous dynamics were not caused by static structural differences, but were largely stochastic. This stochastic heterogeneity is thus an intrinsic property of cardiac sarcomere dynamics and is likely to be crucial for the adaptation of emergent cardiomyocyte contractility to mechanical constraints from its environment.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Sarcomeres are the basic contractile cytoskeletal units of striated muscle, including cardiac muscle. In most species, sarcomeres are ∼2 µm in length and consist of highly ordered bipolar bundles of myosin motor proteins interdigitated with actin filaments, tied together in the Z-bands. (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). Force generation by myosin interacting with actin is regulated by intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> and fueled by chemical energy (ATP)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. Sarcomeres are serially connected into myofibrils. A cardiomyocyte (CM) contains tens of parallel myofibrils. Overall CM contractility is a mesoscopic process that emerges from a very large number of coupled, non-linear, stochastic, elementary force generators. A fundamental question that has not been answered during more than a century of muscle research is how molecular-scale stochastic dynamics in this non-equilibrium, excitable system eventually results in the emergent, organized dynamics at the cell and organ scale.</p>

<p>Macroscopic muscle contraction, on the one hand, as well as single-molecule kinetics of acto-myosin, on the other hand, have been well studied<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. In connecting the microscopic to the macroscopic level, a critical assumption commonly used is that the force that individual sarcomeres exert are primarily a function of sarcomere length (force-length relation)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>, i.e., determined by the overlap between actin and myosin filaments, which are protected from slipping apart by passive mechanical elements, such as titin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>. A technical limitation of whole-fiber length measurements or diffraction experiments is that they do not report the length of individual sarcomeres, but instead only an average length<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. Individual sarcomere dynamics and heterogeneity among sarcomeres is thereby averaged out. Furthermore, it is uncertain if the classical model of sarcomere contraction, governed by a steady-state force-length relationship, applies to the rapid periodic dynamics of cardiac muscle, with cyclic activation of acto-myosin by ∼300 ms long Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Individual cardiac sarcomeres have indeed been shown to exhibit spontaneous oscillatory contractions (SPOCs) when sub-maximally activated, although the physiological relevance of this phenomenon remains unclear<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>. In simple dynamic models of motor proteins, it has been shown by numerical simulations that coupled motors can exhibit complex non-linear phenomena, such as dynamic instabilities and limit-cycle oscillations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>, some of which have also been observed in <italic>in-vitro</italic> experiments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. In general, it is known that complex dynamic phenomena can emerge when non-linear dynamic systems are coupled<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>In cardiac muscle, deterministic dynamics are vital for efficient and robust organ function. It is thus important to understand at what level in the hierarchical construction of muscle microscopic stochasticity merges into deterministic dynamics. While some intrinsic stochasticity on the single-sarcomere level and heterogeneity among coupled sarcomeres might be unavoidable or even favorable to reduce local stresses, it might under pathological conditions, such as in a fibrotic (stiffened) ventricle, contribute to heart muscle dysfunction. Theoretical studies have explored functional implications of (potentially pathological) static sarcomere non-uniformity, indicating that already small degrees of sarcomere non-uniformity could dramatically affect muscle function <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. If individual sarcomeres would vary in strength due to damage or disease, weak sarcomeres would continuously be overpowered by their neighbors, which could lead to muscle damage and failure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. Experiments on isolated myofibrils, mostly from skeletal muscle at low temperatures (&lt;20°C) and with constant steady-state calcium activation, found evidence of sarcomere non-uniformity, particularly under isometric and overstretched conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>. It remained unclear what these results mean for sarcomere dynamics during <italic>in-vivo</italic> cardiac contraction at 37°C under transient calcium activation. Recent <italic>in-vivo</italic> measurements of sarcomere dynamics in mouse hearts found evidence for some asynchronicity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>. The physiology of mice hearts with much higher beating frequencies (470 bpm) and expression of distinct sarcomere protein isoforms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup> differs substantially from human hearts. It is not known if heterogeneous stochastic sarcomere dynamics can also occur in the human heart at physiological contraction rates (∼60 bpm).</p>
<p>Human pluripotent stem-cell (PSC)-derived CMs are, despite their intrinsic immaturity, well-established as an accessible and scalable platform to investigate human CM structure and function <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>. To enhance structural uniformity, to establish a “physiological” aspect ratio with anisotropic alignment of myofibrils, and to support auxotonic contractions, PSC-derived CMs can be cultured on micro-printed cell-adhesive patterns on soft hydrogels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>. To facilitate structural and functional analyses in living CMs, fluorescent labeling by genome editing using CRISPR/Cas9 in combination with high-resolution microscopy techniques can be employed <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>. We created a human iPSC reporter line with endogenous fluorescent labeling (Citrine) of the myocyte specific z-band protein alpha-actinin 2 (ACTN2) to study sarcomere dynamics in real-time with high spatial and temporal resolution (Härtter <italic>et al</italic>., submitted<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>). Culturing of ACTN2-Citrine CMs on micropatterned soft gels with various Young’s moduli (5 - 85 kPa) enabled us to record movies of sarcomere dynamics in single spontaneously beating CMs under different mechanical boundary conditions. For an unbiased analysis of sarcomere dynamics, we employed the deep learning-based Sarcomere Analysis Multi-tool (SarcAsM)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup> that can segment and track the motion of individual sarcomere z-bands with 27 nm spatial and 16 ms temporal resolution. Surprisingly, we found that the motility of individual sarcomeres during contraction cycles was almost independent of the external load imposed by the elastic substrates, while heterogeneity between sarcomeres increased strongly with substrate stiffness, leading to a decrease of overall CM contractions. Our findings show that myofibril-level contractility under different load conditions is not regulated within single sarcomeres but emerges in a tug-of-war-like competition among highly dynamic sarcomeres that switch from synchronous contraction to asynchronous dynamics under more rigid constraints. Furthermore, we could show that heterogeneity among sarcomeres is largely stochastic, i.e., not predetermined by static non-uniformity.</p>

<title>Individual ACTN2-Citrine hiPSC-derived CMs on micro-patterned elastic substrates</title>
<p>To resolve sarcomere dynamics with high spatial and temporal resolution in PSC-derived cardiomyocytes, we used a CRISPR-engineered induced pluripotent (iPSC) stem cell line, expressing a yellow fluorescing protein as ACTN2-Citrine N-terminal fusion protein after cardiomyocyte differentiation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>. Seeding of differentiated cardiomyocytes on soft elastic polyacrylamide gels functionalized with a micro-printed pattern promoted anisotropic myofibril assembly in uniformly elongated cardiomyocytes (70 × 10 µm; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>). Culturing cells on gels with defined elasticities (Young’s moduli: 5 kPa, 9 kPa, 15 kPa, 29 kPa, 49 kPa, 85 kPa; <bold>Table S1</bold>) allowed us to impose auxotonic loads on the cells on a scale considered to be relevant <italic>in vivo</italic> under physiological (10-20 kPa) and pathological (e.g., fibrosis; ≥30 kPa) conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>.

<title>Automated tracking of sarcomere motion at high spatial and temporal resolution</title>
<p>We used SarcAsM, a machine-learning (ML) software tool for automated segmentation of z-bands and analysis of sarcomere structure and dynamics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup> for data evaluation. SarcAsM automatically identified 3,985 regions of interest (ROIs), up to 4 per cell, with well-organized registered sarcomeres (≥10 sarcomeres; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>, <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">S1</xref>). Along each ROI line (∼800 nm in width), an intensity kymograph of Z-band motion was extracted from deep-learning processed (SarcAsM) movies (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>).

<title>Cardiomyocyte and individual sarcomere contractility as a function of substrate stiffness</title>
<p>We found that hiPSC-CMs beat spontaneously at a frequency of 0.91 ± 0.38 Hz, which was largely independent of the substrate stiffness (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2A</xref>).

In total, we analyzed a data set of 3,985 ROIs recorded from 1,362 cells, each over at least 10 contraction cycles. We excluded irregularly beating (beat-to-beat variability &gt;0.1 s) and very rapidly (&gt;2 Hz) or slowly (&lt;0.5 Hz) beating cells. We further limited the analysis to ROIs spanning whole myofibrils, where the average length change was strictly negative, i.e., contracting. Out of the full data set of 3,985 ROIs, 2,062 ROIs met these criteria. This selection ensured that we focused on rhythmically and uniformly contracting cells. As expected, maximal average contraction amplitudes <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="596183v1_inline5.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>, measured at the peaks of shortening in each contraction cycle, were the largest (0.18 ± 0.05 µm) on the softest (5 kPa) substrates and were close to zero (0.04 ± 0.03 µm) on the hardest substrates (85 kPa; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>). Maximal contraction amplitudes <italic>ΔSL</italic><sub>–</sub> of individual sarcomeres in each contraction cycle were also largest on 5 kPa substrates at 0.23 ± 0.09 µm and declined to 0.14 ± 0.07 µm on 85 kPa (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref>). Note that the decline of maximal individual sarcomere shortening (<italic>ΔSL</italic><sub>–</sub>) by ∼30% from 5 to 85 kPa was far less than the ∼75% decline of the average sarcomere contraction (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="596183v1_inline6.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>). In addition, while myofibrils never elongated beyond resting length, as expected for auxotonic contractions, individual sarcomeres frequently elongated well beyond their resting length during contraction cycles (median <italic>ΔSL</italic><sub>+</sub> = 0.05 µm). The distributions of maximal sarcomere extension amplitudes (<italic>ΔSL</italic><sub>+</sub>) were remarkably similar between substrate conditions (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref>).</p>
<p>Next, we evaluated the effect of substrate elasticity on average and individual sarcomere contraction and extension velocities. The average extremal velocities <italic>V̅</italic><sub>+</sub>and <italic>V̅</italic><sub>–</sub> followed the same trend as the extremal average length changes <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="596183v1_inline7.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="596183v1_inline8.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> and were the largest on 5 kPa and declined steadily and strongly with increasing substrate stiffness (from 5 to 85 kPa by 58% for contraction and by 54% for elongation; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2F</xref>). The single extremal contraction and extension velocities <italic>V</italic><sub>–</sub> and <italic>V</italic><sub>+</sub>, in contrast, were far less affected by substrate elasticity and differed only by 3% - 6% for the various substrate conditions (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2G</xref>). Note that the maximal extension velocities were 29 - 38% larger than the maximal absolute contraction velocities, showing a strong asymmetry between single sarcomere contraction and extension dynamics. Unlike the average sarcomere motion with clearly distinguishable contraction and relaxation phases, single sarcomeres exhibited rapid switching between slow contractile and fast extensile motion patterns with sometimes multiple shortening and lengthening phases within one contraction cycle (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig, 2H,I</xref>, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D-F</xref>). To better quantify this phenomenon, we analyzed the oscillation frequencies of the average and individual length changes <italic>ΔSL</italic>(<italic>t</italic>) over time, utilizing Morlet wavelet analysis, a method that makes it possible to extract the instantaneous oscillation frequencies of a signal. The analysis revealed a narrow range of frequencies surrounding the beating rate in the scalogram of average sarcomere length changes <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="596183v1_inline9.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2H,I</xref>). Conversely, for individual sarcomeres, we found a broader range of frequencies, with notable peaks occurring at the dominant and macroscopically visible whole-cell beating rate as well as a surprising, large secondary peak at 3 ± 0.5 Hz (2,062 ROIs, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2J</xref>). This distinctive high-frequency oscillation was consistently observed across numerous ROIs and appeared to be independent of the beating rate. The intrinsic oscillatory motion of individual sarcomeres suggests a mechanism of active acto-myosin powered contraction coupled with rapid lengthening in a relaxation oscillator-like behavior <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>.</p>

<title>Correlation analysis of sarcomere motion identifies stochastic and static heterogeneity</title>

The decrease of serial correlation, on the other hand, indicates an increased beat-to-beat variability of the motions of individual sarcomeres (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>).

<title>Sarcomere popping events are stochastically independent and not only occur in structurally “weak” sarcomeres</title>
<p>The large spread in lengthening amplitudes and velocities (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E,G</xref>) we observed on all substrates was caused by isolated large elongations of some sarcomeres in a given myofibril beyond their resting lengths during phases of contraction, mostly at the end of systoles (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figs. 1D-F</xref>). This all-or-nothing phenomenon of strong elongation, to up to 0.5 µm beyond resting length, is hereafter denoted as sarcomere “popping”. A similar phenomenon has been described in skeletal muscle (<italic>38</italic>), but has, to our knowledge, not been shown experimentally in CMs. Since sarcomeres can only actively contract, such elongation is likely a passive relaxation after a threshold tension causes an avalanche-like release of all myosin heads from the actin filaments in an individual sarcomere while connected sarcomeres keep contracting. To analyze when and where sarcomeres pop, we identified popping events in all sarcomere ROIs by detecting extensions beyond 0.25 µm (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A,B</xref>). For each ROI we then created a binary 2D array (popping = 1, no popping = 0; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>). Based on that data, we analyzed the temporal and spatial distribution of popping events. We calculated the overall popping frequency <italic>n</italic>(<italic>P</italic>) = #total events/(#cycles x #sarcomere), as well as the frequency for each contraction cycle <italic>n<sub>c</sub></italic>(<italic>P</italic>) = #events in a given cycle/#sarcomeres and for each individual sarcomere <italic>n<sub>s</sub></italic>(<italic>P</italic>) = #events in a given sarcomere/#cycles. Substrate elasticity did affect the popping frequency (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref>), with popping getting the more frequent the stiffer the substrate was. On 9 kPa and 49 kPa substrates, popping events were 40% and 95% more frequent than on a 5 kPa substrate, respectively. Because popping frequency of single sarcomeres might be affected by sarcomere-specific characteristics, such as the equilibrium length <italic>SL</italic><sub>0</sub>, we assessed the effect of <italic>SL</italic><sub>0</sub> on popping frequency <italic>n<sub>s</sub></italic>(<italic>P</italic>) of single sarcomeres (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E</xref>). “Longer” sarcomeres with <italic>SL</italic><sub>0</sub> ≈ 2 µm popped significantly more often than “shorter” sarcomeres with <italic>SL</italic><sub>0</sub> = 1.5 µm, on 5 and 9 kPa by a factor of ∼5, and on 15 - 85 kPa by a factor of ∼2. Popping frequencies were never smaller than 5% under any condition (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D,E</xref>).</p>

<p>Popping events appeared to occur randomly in time and in uncorrelated locations along the myofibrils. Note that apparent accumulations of popping events also appear with simulated Bernoulli-distributed random events (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4F</xref>). If popping events were indeed random in time and location (i.e., be stochastically independent), both the distances between popping events within a myofibril <italic>d</italic> and the time gaps between two popping events in a given sarcomere <italic>τ</italic>, would follow a geometric distribution, equivalent to the time interval between successes in a number of Bernoulli trials (1 = success, 0 = failure) with probability <italic>p</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>.

Given the considerable number of regions of interest (ROIs) exhibiting stochastically independent popping events, we hypothesize that while the prior probabilities for popping can indeed be influenced by individual sarcomere characteristics, such as length, strengths, or damaged morphology, popping also happens in myofibrils with uniformly structured sarcomeres across all substrate stiffness conditions.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Culturing human stem-cell derived CMs, genome edited to produce fluorescent Z-band markers, made it possible to study sarcomere dynamics in regularly beating CMs under close-to-physiological conditions. Hidden behind the regular contractions of the whole cells, we discovered rich dynamic behavior of individual sarcomeres, including rapid oscillatory motions, stochastic heterogeneity and large-amplitude sarcomere popping.</p>
<p>While whole cells contracted less on stiffer substrates, substrate stiffness had only a weak inhibitory effect on single sarcomere motion amplitudes. Instead, increasing external constraints by more rigid substrates forced sarcomeres into a tug-of-war like competition leading to loss of synchrony. A possible cause of this behavior is an intrinsic dynamical instability of sarcomeres where, at a threshold force, myosin attachment to actin is lost and sarcomeres extend rapidly. This can be formally described by a non-monotonicity of the force-velocity relation, as suggested by biophysical theories for coupled molecular motors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. Each CM sarcomere contains ∼10<sup>5</sup>-10<sup>6</sup> myosin motors and actin filaments. Therefore, extension events are a collective, avalanche-like phenomenon in a given sarcomere, i.e. a dynamic phase transition between active shortening and fast passive lengthening/slipping. Once the tension on the acto-myosin system is partially released, myosin heads gain traction again and the sarcomere transitions again to the shortening mode, resulting in high-frequency relaxation oscillations. The stiffer the underlying substrate, the more and earlier the individual sarcomeres pass the force threshold and switch to lengthening mode.</p>
<p>Through detailed analysis of sarcomere trajectories and the occurrence of popping events, our data suggest that both static and stochastic heterogeneity among sarcomeres contribute to the observed dynamics. Static non-uniformities among sarcomeres, perhaps due to differences in the number of molecular components or structural defects, might predispose the motion patterns of individual sarcomeres. We did, however, under all conditions, observe a substantial number of ROIs that showed a high degree of stochastic heterogeneity (<italic>R</italic> ≈ 1) and sarcomere popping events occurring in a stochastically independent manner. Randomly occurring extensions would in that case ultimately be caused by stochastic acto-myosin kinetics, generating fluctuating forces. It is characteristic for dynamic instabilities in complex systems that small stochastic fluctuations get amplified and are thus fully sufficient to drive highly divergent dynamics even of structurally uniform sarcomeres.</p>
<p>The popping of individual sarcomeres towards the end of contractions indicates that sarcomere dynamic instabilities are especially pronounced during the contraction cycle phase in which acto-myosin coupling is reduced and thus the sarcomere is less stable. Interestingly, popping appeared to be fully reversible and was largely independent of beating frequencies and occurred on all substrates. We believe, that popping events are not aberrations but intrinsic aspects of sarcomere dynamics, manifesting stochastically in structurally uniform sarcomeres in healthy and well-ordered cardiomyocytes.</p>
<p>In summary, these findings suggest that stochastic heterogeneity and popping are intrinsic non-pathological phenomena, while static non-uniformities partially destroy this “stochastic balance” among sarcomeres. In healthy adult cardiomyocytes with more ordered sarcomere morphologies than in stem-cell derived cardiomyocytes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>, static non-uniformities are expected to be much less pronounced, but stochastic heterogeneity could persist. This is indeed suggested by recent in-situ measurements of single sarcomere dynamics in mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>The (patho-)physiological roles and potential benefits of sarcomere stochastic heterogeneity and popping for cardiac muscle function are unexplored. Sarcomere popping has been previously reported in skeletal muscle in the context of residual force enhancement during active overstretch<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>. We hypothesize that popping of some sarcomeres in cardiac muscle towards the end of contractions might speed up the return to equilibrium length on myofibril level at the onset of quiescent period, while the individual sarcomeres are still non-uniform in length and relax more slowly. One role of the stochasticity might be that possibly unavoidable extreme stresses would be uniformly distributed among sarcomeres, which would enhance system robustness and reduce the likelihood of mechanical damage. Non-uniformities at a low intrinsic level would be compensated by the inherent stochasticity and not translate to static heterogeneity, e.g., making one marginally weaker sarcomere always pop. Diseases affecting sarcomeric structure and function could perturb this balance by introducing additional static non-uniformity and thus lead to damage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>. In future research, an in-depth analysis of the interplay between local sarcomere-level and cell-level morphology and function might create further insight into the relevance of heterogeneity and stochasticity in healthy and diseased cardiac muscle.</p>

Whenever applicable, we employed the Kruskal-Wallis test, a non-parametric method, for hypothesis testing, and proceeded to a post-hoc multi-comparison using Dunn’s test, setting the threshold for statistical significance at a p-value of less than 0.01. All condition differences were deemed significant except where explicitly marked as not significant (n.s.).</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this manuscript, the authors experimentally demonstrated the heterogeneous behavior of sarcomeres in cardiomyocytes and that a stochastic component exists in their contractile activity, which cancels out at the level of myofibrils.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The experiments and data analysis are robust and valid. With very good statistics and unbiased methods, they show cellular activity at the individual level and highlight the heterogeneity between biological networks. The similarity of the results to the study cited in [24] demonstrates the validity of the in vitro setup for answering these questions and the feasibility of such in-vitro systems to extend our knowledge of physiology.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Compared to the current literature ([24]), the study does not show a high degree of innovation. It mainly confirms what has been established in the past. The authors complemented the published experiments by developing an in vitro setup with stem cells and by changing the stiffness of the substrate to simulate pathological conditions. However, the experiments they performed do not allow them to explain more than the study in [24], and the conclusions of their study are based on interpretation and speculation about the possible mechanism underlying the observations.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Sarcomeres, the contractile units of skeletal and cardiac muscle, contract in a concerted fashion to power myofibril and thus muscle fiber contraction.</p>
<p>Muscle fiber contraction depends on the stiffness of the elastic substrate of the cell, yet it is not known how this dependence emerges from the collective dynamics of sarcomeres. Here, the authors analyze the contraction time series of individual sarcomeres using live imaging of fluorescently labeled cardiomyocytes cultured on elastic substrates of different stiffness. They find that reduced collective contractility of muscle fibers on unphysiologically stiff substrates is partially explained by a lack of synchronization in the contraction of individual sarcomeres.</p>
<p>This lack of synchronization is at least partially stochastic, consistent with the notion of a tug-of-war between sarcomeres on stiff sarcomeres. A particular irregularity of sarcomere contraction cycles is 'popping', the extension of sarcomeres beyond their rest length. The statistics of 'popping' suggest that this is a purely random process.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This study thus marks an important shift of perspective from whole-cell analysis towards an understanding of the collective dynamics of coupled, stochastic sarcomeres.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Further insight into mechanisms could be provided by additional analyses and/or comparisons to mathematical models.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The manuscript of Haertter and coworkers studied the variation of length of a single sarcomere and the response of microfibrils made by sarcomeres of cardiomyocytes on soft gel substrates of varying stiffnesses.</p>
<p>The measurements at the level of a single sarcomere are an important new result of this manuscript. They are done by combining the labeling of the sarcomeres z line using genetic manipulation and a sophisticated tracking program using machine learning. This single sarcomere analysis shows strong heterogeneities of the sarcomeres that can show fast oscillations not synchronized with the average behavior of the cell</p>
<p>
and what the authors call popping events which are large amplitude oscillations. Another important result is the fact that cardiomyocyte contractility decreases with the substrate stiffness although the properties of single sarcomeres do not seem to depend on substrate stiffness.</p>
<p>The authors suggest that the cardiomyocyte cell behavior is dominated by sarcomere heterogeneity. They show that the heterogeneity between sarcomeres is stochastic and that the contribution of static heterogeneity (such as composition differences between sarcomeres)</p>
<p>
is small.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>All the results are to my knowledge new and original and deserve attention.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>However, I find the manuscript a bit frustrating because the authors only give very qualitative explanations of the phenomena that they observe. They mention that popping could be explained by a nonlinear force-velocity relation of the sarcomere leading to a rapid detachment of all motors. However, they do not explicitly provide a theoretical description. How would the popping depend on the parameters and in particular on the substrate stiffness? Would the popping statistics be affected by the stiffness? It is also not clear to me how the dependence on the soft gel stiffness of the cardiomyocyte cell can be explained by the stochasticity of the sarcomere properties. Can any of the results found by the authors be explained by existing theories of cardiomyocytes? The only one I know is that of Safran and coworkers.</p>
<p>I also found the paper very difficult to read. The authors should perhaps reorganize the structure of the presentation in order to highlight what the new and important results are.</p>
