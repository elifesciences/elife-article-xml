<title>Abstract</title><p>Protein Phosphatase 1 (PP1) relies on association with PP1-interacting proteins (PIPs) to generate substrate-specific PIP/PP1 holoenzymes, but the lack of well-defined substrates has hindered elucidation of the mechanisms involved. We previously demonstrated that the Phactr1 PIP confers sequence specificity on the Phactr1/PP1 holoenzyme by remodelling the PP1 hydrophobic substrate groove. Phactr1 defines a group of “RVxF-ΦΦ-R-W” PIPs that all interact with PP1 in a similar fashion. Here we use a PP1-PIP fusion approach to address sequence specificity and identify substrates of the RVxF-ΦΦ-R-W family PIPs. We show that the four Phactr proteins confer identical sequence specificities on their holoenzymes. We identify the 4E-BP and p70 S6K translational regulators as substrates for the Neurabin/Spinophilin PIPs, implicated in neuronal plasticity, pointing to a role for their holoenzymes in mTORC1-dependent translational control. Biochemical and structural experiments show that in contrast to the Phactrs, substrate recruitment and catalytic efficiency of the PP1-Neurabin and PP1-Spinophilin fusions is primarily determined by substrate interaction with the PDZ domain adjoining their RVxF-ΦΦ-R-W motifs, rather than by recognition of the remodelled PP1 hydrophobic groove. Thus, even PIPs that interact with PP1 in a similar manner use different mechanisms to ensure substrate selectivity.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Protein Phosphatase 1 is a member of the PPP superfamily of protein phosphatases, responsible for most cellular serine/threonine dephosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bollen et al, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Brautigan and Shenolikar, 2018</xref>){Bollen, 2010 #4;Brautigan, 2018 #6}. The three PP1 isoforms possess a central metal-binding active centre from which radiate three putative substrate-binding grooves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Egloff et al, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Goldberg et al, 1995</xref>), but have little intrinsic sequence specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Hoermann et al, 2020</xref>). Instead, PP1 substrate specificity and activity is controlled by over 200 PP1 interacting proteins (PIPs), which use a number of short linear motifs (SLIMs) to dock with distinct regions of the PP1 surface, including the substrate-binding grooves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Cohen, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bollen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Casamayor and Arino, 2020</xref>). PIPs can target PP1 to specific subcellular locations, and are control substrate specificity through autonomous substrate-binding domains, occupation or extension of the substrate grooves, or modification of PP1 surface electrostatics (for references see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bollen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Fedoryshchak et al, 2020</xref>). Only a few PIP-PP1-substrate interactions are understood in molecular detail, however, and the question of whether PIP interaction imposes sequence specificity on PP1, as opposed to simply bringing enzyme and substrate into close apposition, has remained largely unexplored.</p>
<p>The Phactr family of actin-regulated PP1 cofactors are the only PIPs known to directly impose substrate sequence-specificity at the dephosphorylation site itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Fedoryshchak et al., 2020</xref>). They belong to subset of PIPs that bind PP1 through a conserved “RVxF-ΦΦ-R-W string” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Ragusa et al, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Choy et al, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Chen et al, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Fedoryshchak et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Yan et al, 2021</xref>). These include Neurabin/Spinophilin, which play important roles in PP1-dependent regulation of neuronal plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Allen et al, 1997</xref>; Burnett, 1998 #87, reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Sarrouilhe et al, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Foley et al, 2021</xref>); PNUTS, which regulates PolII and chromatin dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Lee et al, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Cortazar et al, 2019</xref>); and PPP1R15A/B, which mediates translational regulation through control of eIF2 dephosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Novoa et al, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Chen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Yan et al., 2021</xref>). In the Phactr1-PP1 holoenzyme, Phactr1 sequences C-terminal to the RVxF-ΦΦ-R-W string interact with the PP1 hydrophobic groove to form a composite hydrophobic pocket, topped by a basic rim. This imposes strong sequence selectivity on substrates, favouring hydrophobic residues at positions +4/+5 relative to the phosphorylated residue, within an acidic context (consensus pS/T-x<sub>(2-3)</sub>-&lt;Δ-L, the “LLD motif”). Strikingly, this specificity is maintained in a PP1-Phactr1 fusion protein comprising PP1(1-304) linked to Phactr1 sequences from residue 526, just C-terminal to its RVxF motif.</p>
<p>Neurabin/Spinophilin remodel the PP1 hydrophobic groove differently from Phactr1, generating a structurally distinct surface on the holoenzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Ragusa et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Fedoryshchak et al., 2020</xref>), and it is likely that the other RVxF-ΦΦ-R-W PIPs do so as well. Whether and how these diverse surfaces might play a role in the substrate specificity of these PIP/PP1 holoenzymes has remained unclear, largely because little is known about their substrates. Here we investigate determinants of substrate specificity in the other RVxF-ΦΦ-R-W PIPs, focussing on Neurabin/Spinophilin, which also contain a PDZ domain previously suggested to be involved in substrate recruitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Burnett et al, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Kelker et al, 2007</xref>). We use the PP1-PIP fusion approach to show that the four Phactr1 holoenzymes have indistinguishable substrate specificities, and to identify novel candidate substrates for the other RVxF-ΦΦ-R-W PIP/PP1 complexes. We use 4E-BP1, a new Neurabin/PP1 substrate, to show that unlike the Phactr1/PP1 holoenzyme, substrate specificity of Neurabin/PP1 is largely determined by interaction with the Neurabin PDZ domain rather than the primary sequences of the dephosphorylation site itself.</p>

<title>PP1-PIP fusion proteins</title>
<p>The PP1 C-terminal sequences closely approach the Phactr1 RVxF-ΦΦ-R-W string in the vicinity of the ΦΦ motif, which allowed the construction of a single chain PP1α -PIP fusion derivative comprising PP1α(7-304) linked to Phactr1 sequences from a point just C-terminal to its RVxF motif (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). The remodelled hydrophobic groove of this fusion is structurally identical to that of the Phactr/PP1 holoenzyme, and it retains similar activity and specificity(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Fedoryshchak et al., 2020</xref>). Guided by the structures of the other RVxF-ΦΦ-R-W PIPs, we generated analogous fusions of N-terminally Flag-tagged PP1 with fragments of Neurabin and Spinophilin (PPP1R9A/B, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bollen et al., 2010</xref>), PPP1R15A and PPP1R15B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Chen et al., 2015</xref>), and PNUTS (PPP1R10, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Choy et al., 2014</xref>), comprising the PP1-interacting sequences and any known protein interaction domains immediately C-terminal to them. We also constructed fusions with each the four Phactr proteins to explore any variation in their sequence specificities (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A, 1B</xref>; <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1A</xref>).</p>

<p>Each fusion protein was stably expressed in 293 Flp-In T-Rex cells using a tetracycline-inducible vector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Ward et al, 2011</xref>). Tetracycline titration of PP1-Phactr1 cells induced increasing expression of the fusion protein, leading to corresponding dephosphorylation of its substrates IRSp53 pS455 and Afadin pS1275 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Fedoryshchak et al., 2020</xref>) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). Afadin pS1275 was also dephosphorylated by the other three PP1-Phactr fusions, but not by the other PP1-PIP fusions (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). Similar results were observed with exogenously expressed wildtype IRSp53; as expected, the +5 residue L460A mutation, which impairs dephosphorylation by the intact Phactr1/PP1 holoenzyme, impaired sensitivity to all the fusions, indicating that they recognise phosphorylated IRSp53 in a similar way (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1B</xref>).</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<title>Proteomic analysis of PP1-fusion specificity</title>
<p>To investigate the substrate specificities of the fusion proteins, we performed Tandem-Mass-Tag (TMT) phosphoproteomics. Fractionated peptides were measured in both MS2 and MS3 modes for maximal identification and quantification (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). Phosphophorylation side abundances within triplicate samples from the same cell line were comparable between replicates (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). First, we identified phosphorylation sites significantly depleted by expression of PP1α(7-304) alone compared with vector only, using Perseus software and a t-test with a 1% permutation-based false-discovery rate cutoff (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Tyanova et al, 2016</xref>). In agreement with previous results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Hoermann et al., 2020</xref>), PP1 exhibited little sequence specificity, other than a preference for positively charged residues in positions -3, -1 and +3 to the dephosphorylation site (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2A</xref>, <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">S2B</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>We then compared the specificities of the four PP1-Phactr fusion proteins. Expression of the PP1-Phactr1 revealed numerous phosphorylation sites that were specifically depleted compared with cells expressing PP1α alone (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>). This population contained Phactr1/PP1 holoenzyme substrates previously identified in neurons or NIH3T3 fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Fedoryshchak et al., 2020</xref>), including IRSp53 pS455 and Afadin pS1275, and was substantially enriched in the Phactr1/PP1 consensus dephosphorylation motif S/T-x<sub>2,3</sub>-Φ-L (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>). The profiles of PP1-Phactr2, PP1-Phactr3, and PP1-Phactr4 cells were substantially similar (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2C</xref>), exhibiting good overall correlations both between total phosphorylation site profiles (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>), and significant enrichment for both the S/T-x<sub>2,3</sub>-Φ-L motif and specific Phactr1/PP1 substrates (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>); over 60% of the depleted phosphorylation sites were in common between all four fusions (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>). These data show that the PP1-Phactr fusions recapitulate the specificity of the Phactr1/PP1 holoenzyme.</p>
<p>We next used the proteomics approach to investigate protein dephosphorylation by the PP1-R15A/B and PP1-PNUTS fusion proteins, comparing each fusion to all the others (other than its paralog) or PP1α alone (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). PPP1R15A has a well-validated substrate, eIF2α pS51 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Novoa et al., 2001</xref>), whose effective dephosphorylation requires additional recruitment of G-actin to the PPP1R15A/PP1 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Chen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Yan et al., 2021</xref>). The eIF2α pS51 phosphorylation site was not detected in the dataset, however, and no other phosphorylation sites were detectably depleted, apart from PPP6R1 S531, in cells expressing PPP1R15B (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figure S3A,S3B</xref>). Expression of the PP1-PNUTS fusion, which includes sequences that recruit WDR82 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Lee et al., 2010</xref>), led to specific depletion of phosphorylation sites from CXXC1/CFP1 and SET1B, which along with WDR82 are components of the COMPASS histone lysine <italic>N</italic>-methyl transferase complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Cenik and Shilatifard, 2021</xref>) (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figure S3C</xref>). These proteins bear no obvious sequence similarity in the vicinity of the dephosphorylation site (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figure S3D</xref>). These findings will be explored in future work.</p>

<sec id="s2c">
<title>New candidate substrates for Neurabin and Spinophilin</title>
<p>Having validated the PP1-PIP fusion approach, we focussed on Neurabin and Spinophilin, two PIPs implicated in neuronal plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Sarrouilhe et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Foley et al., 2021</xref>), which contain a PDZ domain implicated in recruitment of potential substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Burnett et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Yan et al, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Sarrouilhe et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Kelker et al., 2007</xref>). The PDZ domain is separated from the RVxF-ΦΦ-R-W string by a 5-turn α-helix, which remodels the PP1 hydrophobic groove in a manner distinct from Phactr1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Ragusa et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Fedoryshchak et al., 2020</xref>).</p>
<p>Expression of the PP1-Neurabin or PP1-Spinophilin fusions led to specific depletion of closely related sets of phosphorylation sites (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>,<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3B</xref>). These included multiple sites from the translational inhibitor proteins 4E-BP1 and 4E-BP2. Levels of total 4E-BP1 and 4E-BP2 proteins were not affected (Figures S3E). Phosphorylation sites from two other proteins, DTL and CAMSAP3, were also significantly depleted upon expression of both PP1-Spinophilin and PP1-Neurabin fusions, while a further 7 were specific to one fusion or the other. However, apart from a preference for proline at position +1, inspection these sequences did not reveal any obvious sequence similarities in the vicinity of the dephosphorylation site (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>).

<title>The PP1-Neurabin PDZ domain is required for 4E-BP1 dephosphorylation</title>
<p>To demonstrate a direct enzyme-substrate relationship between 4E-BP1 and PP1-Neurabin we expressed mCherry-tagged 4E-BP1 in 293 cells, recovered it on RFP-trap affinity beads, and incubated it with increasing amounts recombinant PP1-Neurabin. Analysis with the phospho-specific antibodies confirmed that pT37/46, pS65/101 and pT70 are all targets for dephosphorylation by PP1-Neurabin, with pT70 being somewhat preferred (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A, 4B</xref>).

<p>Simple deletion of the 4E-BP1 C-terminal residues substantially blocked phosphorylation of transfected mCherry-4E-BP1 (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figure S4A</xref>), reflecting the loss of the C-terminal TOR signalling (TOS) motif required for mTORC1 kinase recruitment and 4E-BP1 phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Schalm and Blenis, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Yang et al, 2017</xref>). Since the C-terminal carboxylate, which is essential for PDZ interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Harris and Lim, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Subbaiah et al, 2011</xref>), is not part of the TOS motif, we generated mCherry-4E-BP1(118+A), in which an additional C-terminal alanine should still allow TOS-mediated phosphorylation, but prevent PDZ interaction. While mCherry-4E-BP1(118+A) was efficiently phosphorylated upon expression in 293 cells (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figure S4A</xref>), its dephosphorylation <italic>in vitro</italic> required PP1-Neurabin concentrations some 20-50 times greater than the wildtype protein (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A, 4B</xref>). These results suggest that the 4E-BP1 C-terminal sequences constitute a PDZ binding motif (PBM), and point to a role for the Neurabin and Spinophilin PDZ domains in substrate recognition.</p>
<p>We next used a fluorescence polarization assay to compare the PDZ-binding affinity of the 4E-BP C-terminal sequences with those of p70 S6K, and other proteins reported to be Neurabin/Spinophilin PDZ ligands (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Burnett et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Penzes et al, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Kelker et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Ragusa et al., 2010</xref>). The 4E-BP1 PBM, which is identifical amongst all three 4E-BP isoforms, bound the PDZ domains with comparable affinities in the micromolar range, and binding was abolished by substitution of the C-terminal hydrophobic residues (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>,<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4D</xref>; <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figure S4B</xref>).

<title>PDZ domain interaction determines PP1-Neurabin specificity</title>
<p>We next compared how interactions with the PP1-Neurabin PDZ and the remodelled PP1 hydrophobic groove contribute to substrate specificity.

<p>PP1-Neurabin dephosphorylated 4E-BP1<sup>WT</sup> with a catalytic efficiency some 100-fold greater than PP1 alone, while peptide 4E-BP1<sup>MUT</sup>, which cannot bind the Neurabin PDZ domain, was 30-fold less reactive (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>, <xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Figure S5B</xref>).

The Neurabin sequences, specifically the PDZ domain, thus play a critical role in specific 4E-BP pT70 substrate recognition. PP1-Neurabin also dephosphorylated IRSp53<sup>WT</sup> with a comparable catalytic efficiency, but this was entirely dependent on PDZ domain interaction, IRSp53<sup>MUT</sup> being unreactive (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>, <xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Figure S5B</xref>). In contrast, both IRSp53<sup>WT</sup> and IRSp53<sup>MUT</sup> peptides were dephosphorylated by PP1-Phactr1 with a catalytic efficiency some 100-fold greater than PP1 alone. These results demonstrate the critical role played by the PDZ domain substrate specificity, and underscore the role played by PIPs in potentiating the catalytic efficiency of PIP/PP1 complexes.</p>

<title>Substrate interactions with the remodelled PP1 hydrophobic groove do not affect PP1-Neurabin specificity</title>
<p>We next assessed the potential role of the remodelled hydrophobic groove in substrate recognition. Positions +3 to +6 relative to the dephosphorylation site are critical for recognition of the remodelled hydrophobic groove by Phactr1/PP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Fedoryshchak et al., 2020</xref>), so we assessed the effect of mutations at these positions on catalytic activity. PP1-Neurabin dephosphorylated 4E-BP1<sup>WT</sup> containing alanine substitutions, or IRSp53 sequences, at positions +3/4 or +5/6 with slightly increased catalytic efficiency (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>, <xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Figure S5C</xref>). These mutations had strikingly different effects on dephosphorylation by PP1-Phactr1. While the alanine substitutions had little effect, conversion of +4 to +6 to the IRSp53 sequence LLD increased catalytic efficiency some 20-fold (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>, <xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Figure S5C</xref>). Similar results were seen with the IRSp53 substrate peptides: alanine substitution in the groove-interacting region had no effect on PP1-Neurabin catalytic efficiency, but significantly impaired that of PP1-Phactr1 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>, <xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Figure S5D</xref>) Strikingly, alanine substitutions at +1 and +2 in 4E-BP1<sup>WT</sup> increased catalytic efficiency by both fusions, perhaps reflecting changes at the catalytic site itself (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref>, <xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Figure S5E</xref>).</p>
<p>Taken together with the results in the preceding section, these data support a model in which PP1-Neurabin substrate specificity is driven predominantly by the ability of substrates to interact with its PDZ domain rather than the remodelled PP1 hydrophobic groove, in contrast to that of PP1-Phactr1, where the latter plays the dominant role (see Discussion).</p>

<title>Structural analysis of PP1/Neurabin – 4EBP-1 interaction</title>
<p>We next sought to visualise PP1-Neurabin/4E-BP1 interactions directly at the structural level. To do this, we used the “chimera” strategy previously used to examine Phactr1/PP1/substrate interactions, in which Phactr1 substrate sequences were fused C-terminally to PP1(7-304), and co-crystallised with the Phactr1 PP1-interacting C-terminal domain.

<p>In the complex, the PP1 catalytic core and Neurabin PDZ sequences were well resolved, along with the 4E-BP1 PBM, which was docked with the Neurabin PDZ domain (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>). The individual domains were largely identical to a previously published structure of unliganded Spinophilin/PP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Ragusa et al., 2010</xref>) (PP1(1-304) RMSD 0.12 Å, PDZ(493-582 RMSD 0.45 Å). However, the PDZ domain in our Neurabin/PP1-4E-BP1 substrate complex structure is oriented at 21° to that in the unliganded Spinophilin/PP1 complex owing to a slight bend in the C-terminal section of the 5-turn α-helix that connects it to the RVxF-ΦΦ-R-W string (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>). The 4E-BP1 PBM, 113(QFEMDI)118, uses a beta-strand addition mechanism to make extensive contacts with the Spinophilin PDZ domain similar to those seen in other PDZ-ligand complexes (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Harris and Lim, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Subbaiah et al., 2011</xref>, for overview): 4E-BP1 F114, M116 and I118 make hydrophobic contacts with the Neurabin PDZ domain PBM-binding groove, while an extensive hydrogen bonding network is formed between 4E-BP1 F114, M116, and I118 main chain carbonyl and amide groups, and its C-terminal carboxylate, with main chain residues in the PDZ PBM-binding groove (L514, G515, I516, I518, and G520) (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D</xref>).</p>
<p>Apart from the C-terminal sequences, the 4E-BP1 T70 substrate sequences were largely unresolved in the crystal structure. Unlike the Phactr1 substrate chimera, no interactions were seen with the remodelled PP1-Neurabin hydrophobic groove; and no virtual enzyme-product complex and solvent phosphate were detected at the active site, perhaps reflecting the absence of stabilising hydrophobic groove interactions (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>). To gain insight into potential interactions at the PP1 catalytic site, we therefore used AlphaFold3 to model the PP1-4E-BP1 substrate chimera in its phosphorylated and unphosphorylated states (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Figure S6A, S6B</xref>). While the 4E-BP1/ PDZ interaction was correctly predicted regardless of phosphorylation status, only the phosphorylated substrate was predicted to interact directly with the PP1 active site (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6E</xref>, <xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Figure S6B, S6C</xref>). The 4E-BP1 substrate sequence <sup>68</sup>TK(pT70)PPR<sup>73</sup>, predicted with high confidence, docks at the catalytic site, with K69 interacting with D220<sup>PP1</sup>, pT70 interacting with the metal ions, H125<sup>PP1</sup> and R221<sup>PP1</sup>, and P71 interacting with Y134<sup>PP1</sup>, but the remodelled PP1 hydrophobic groove remains unoccupied (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6E</xref>, <xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Figure S6B</xref>). In contrast, AlphaFold3 gives only a low confidence prediction for the unphosphorylated substrate site D74 and L75 interacting with H125<sup>PP1</sup>, and Y134<sup>PP1</sup> (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Figure S6C,S6D</xref>).These results are consistent with the biochemical studies, and support the notion that interaction with the remodelled hydrophobic groove plays no part in recognition of 4E-BP1 by the Neurabin/PP1 holoenzyme.</p>
<p>Finally we used AlphaFold3 to predict interactions between Neurabin/PP1 and full-length 4E-BP1 phosphorylated on T37, T46, S65, T70, or S101 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6F</xref>, <xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Figure S6F</xref>). All the predictions placed the C-terminus of 4E-BP1 in the ligand-binding groove of the PDZ domain, docking the phosphorylated T70 site in the PP1 active site in a similar manner way to that seen in the substrate chimera predictions (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6F</xref>; <xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Figure S6C</xref>). Taken together with the crystallography and biochemical data, our observation support the view that the primary determinant of substrate specificity for Neurabin/PP1 is interaction with the PDZ domain adjacent to the RVxF-ΦΦ-R-W string.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The PP1 catalytic subunit possesses little intrinsic sequence specificity. Instead it recognises specific substrates by forming holoenzymes in which it partners with a variety of PP1 interacting proteins (PIPs) to direct dephosphorylation to specific substrates. We previously showed that interaction of the Phactr1 PIP with PP1 remodels the PP1 hydrophobic substrate groove in such a way as to allowing specific recognition of substrate sequences C-terminal to the dephosphorylation site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Fedoryshchak et al., 2020</xref>). Phactr1 belongs to a group of PIPs that recognise PP1 using a common RVxF-ΦΦ-R-W string, all of which potentially remodel the hydrophobic groove; indeed, structural studies confirm that Spinophilin does this differently from the Phactrs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Ragusa et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Fedoryshchak et al., 2020</xref>). We identified potential substrates for the other RVxF-ΦΦ-R-W PIPs, and elucidate mechanisms of substrate recognition, focussing on the Neurabin and Spinophilin PIPs.</p>
<p>Our previous study showed that a fusion protein comprising PP1 joined to Phactr1 sequences C-terminal to the RVxF motif maintains both the structure and the sequence-specificity of the intact Phactr1/PP1 holoenzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Fedoryshchak et al., 2020</xref>). We used this fusion approach, in conjunction with MS phosphoproteomics in 293 cells, to compare the specificities of the different Phactr family members, and to identify potential substrates for other RVxF-ΦΦ-R-W PIPs. All four PP1-Phactr fusions exhibited virtually identical substrate specificities, which were substantially similar to that of the authentic Phactr1/PP1 holoenzyme, giving confidence that findings made with the fusions are also applicable to other RVxF-ΦΦ-R-W PIP/PP1 holoenzymes. It is likely that differential intracellular targeting and/or tissue-specific expression of the four different Phactr/PP1 holoenzymes allows further refinement of substrate specificity.</p>
<p>Expression of the other PP1-(RVxF-ΦΦ-R-W PIP) fusions revealed potential substrates for PNUTS and PP1-Neurabin/-Spinophilin, but not PP1-PPP1R15A/B. Unlike the PP1-Phactr substrates, however, these exhibited no obvious sequence similarities in the substrate sequences adjacent to the targeted dephosphorylation remodelled hydrophobic groove. For PNUTS, we identified only the SET1A/B-COMPASS complex components CXXC1/CFP1 and SETD1B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Cenik and Shilatifard, 2021</xref>). These may be recruited to PNUTS by interaction with its binding partner WDR82, which is also present in SET1A/B-COMPASS complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Cenik and Shilatifard, 2021</xref>), but further work will be necessary to confirm this.</p>
<p>Expression of the PP1-Neurabin and PP1-Spinophilin fusions identified nine potential substrates with eighteen candidate dephosphorylation sites, of which eight represented conserved mTORC1 dependent phosphorylations of the translational regulators 4E-BP1 and 4E-BP2. Using immunoblotting we found that the p70 S6K activating phosphorylation at T389 also appears to be a substrate for PP1-Neurabin. The 4E-BPs and p70 S6K are critical targets of the mTORC1 pathway, which links translational control to cell nutrient status and extracellular signals in multiple settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Hoeffer and Klann, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Liu and Sabatini, 2020</xref>). Consistent with this, we found that overexpression of PP1-Neurabin can suppress translation when expressed in 293 cells. It therefore is likely that Neurabin and Spinophilin can negatively regulate both arms of the mTORC1 protein synthesis pathway (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figure S3G</xref>).</p>
<p>The presence of multiple dephosphorylation sites on the 4E-BPs with no obvious primary sequence homology raised the question of how these targets are recognised. We found that dephosphorylation of 4E-BP1 by PP1-Neurabin requires its C-terminal sequences, which constitute a PDZ-binding motif (PBM). The micromolar affinity of this interaction, which is stronger than that previously reported for p70 S6K (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Burnett et al., 1998</xref>), may reflect the necessity for effective competition with the mTORC1 kinase complex, which binds the 4E-BPs using a C-terminal TOS motif that overlaps the PBM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Schalm and Blenis, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Yang et al., 2017</xref>). In contrast, we found that other reported ligands, such as the glutamatergic and dopaminergic receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Kelker et al., 2007</xref>) bind the Neurabin/Spinophilin PDZ domains with much lower affinity. In neurons, association of these receptors with Neurabin and PP1 correlates with channel activity and dephosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Wu et al, 2008</xref>; Yan, 1999 #29, reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Foley et al., 2021</xref>). It remains possible that Neurabin/Spinophilin oligomerisation and/or F-actin binding, and receptor membrane localisation, effectively increases the avidity of such weak PBM-PDZ interactions, but more work is required to establish whether these channels are direct Neurabin/PP1 substrates.</p>
<p>We used synthetic peptide substrates derived from 4E-BP1, or the Phactr1/PP1 substrate IRSp53, to investigate how the substrate recognition mechanisms differ between the PP1-Neurabin and PP1-Phactr fusions. In the context of the PP1-PIP fusions, and by extension in that of the PIP/PP1 holoenzyme, the PIP sequences play a critical role in directing substrate specificity and potentiating catalytic efficiency. In the PP1-Neurabin fusion, interaction with the PDZ domain is the critical determinant of both catalytic efficiency and specificity: it increases catalytic efficiency 100-fold above that seen with PP1 alone, or the PP1-Phactr1 fusion. Moreover, the PP1-Neurabin fusion was inactive with the Phactr1/PP1 substrate IRSp53 unless the latter was made competent to bind the Neurabin PDZ domain. Our observations suggest a model in which 4E-BPs are recruited to Neurabin/PP1 via high affinity PBM-PDZ interaction, with the relatively low affinity of active-site interaction allowing dephosphorylation of the multiple sites during one round of PDZ binding. In contrast, dephosphorylation of the Phactr1/PP1 target IRSp53 pS455 by the PP1-Phactr1 fusion protein was critically dependent on interaction with the remodelled hydrophobic groove, consistent with our previous data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Fedoryshchak et al., 2020</xref>).</p>
<p>Several lines of evidence support the view that interaction with the remodelled PP1 hydrophobic groove plays no role in PP1-Neurabin substrate recognition. First, the PP1-Neurabin substrates we identified have obvious sequence similarity at positions +3 to +6, the sequences that potentially interact with the remodelled hydrophobic groove, and alanine substitutions at these positions do not influence PP1-Neurabin catalytic activity. Structural analysis of a PP1-4E-BP1 substrate fusion complexed with Spinophilin, also revealed no substrate contacts with PP1, although the PDZ-4E-BP1 interaction was well-resolved. Finally AlphaFold modelling of complexes formed between 4E-BP1 substrates and the Spinophilin/PP1 holoenzyme predicted phosphorylation-specific interactions with the PP1 catalytic site, but no interactions with the remodelled hydrophobic groove.</p>
<p>Although the remodelled hydrophobic groove does not play a role in 4E-BP recognition by Neurabin/PP1, this does not necessarily mean that sequence-specific dephosphorylation by other PIP/PP1 complexes and substrate recruitment by protein interactions are inherently mutually exclusive: in principle a PIP could recruit substrates through protein interactions, and remodel the PP1 substrate binding grooves to allow discrimination between different phosphorylated sites on the target protein. That said, we think it likely that the other RVxF-ΦΦ-R-W PIPs will also recruit substrates by interaction with other PIP domains, or proteins bound to them. Such interactions might involve WDR82 for PNUTS, and G-actin for PPP1R15A/B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Yan et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Erickson et al, 2024</xref>).</p>
<p>Our findings establish Neurabin/PP1 and Spinophilin/PP1 holoenzymes as new candidate regulators of the mTORC1 pathway. Many studies have focussed on mTORC1 regulation of translation on the control of cell growth, particularly in cancer settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Liu and Sabatini, 2020</xref>), and previous work has shown that endogenous PP2Cψ/ PPM1G contributes to 4E-BP1 dephosphorylation in 293 and HCT116 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Liu et al, 2013</xref>). Localised translational regulation is also important in other settings, however, including neuronal development and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Holt et al, 2019</xref>). Here, mTORC1 signalling plays an important role in neuronal plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Hoeffer and Klann, 2010</xref>), as do both Neurabin and Spinophilin, which are largely neuron specific and enriched in dendritic spines (Wu, 2008 #75, reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Foley et al., 2021</xref>), and the 4E-BPs, particularly 4E-BP2 (for references see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Aguilar-Valles et al, 2015</xref>). Our finding that 4E-BPs are Neurabin/PP1 substrates potentially establishes a direct link between Neurabin and neuronal mTORC1 signalling (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figure S3G</xref>), which will be an interesting topic for future investigation.</p>

<p>Total and phospho-proteomics experiment was performed according to a detailed protocol previously published (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Jones et al, 2020</xref>). Cells expressing PP1-PIP fusion proteins, PP1 only, or vector alone were induced with tetracycline for 16h.Cells were lysed in buffer containing 8 M Urea, 50 mM HEPES pH 8.5, 10 mM Glycerol 2-phosphate, 50 mM NaF, 5 mM Sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM Sodium vanadate, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 1:50 protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche), 1:100 Phosphatase inhibitor cocktail, 400 nM Okadaic acid. Cysteines were reduced and alkylated by iodoacetamide followed by trypsin/rLysC protease digestion. Peptide samples were labelled with 10-plex (UK288606) and additionally 131C (VC294053) TMT reagents from Thermo and pooled. Part of the sample was injected saved for the total proteome analysis. The rest of the sample was used for 2-step phosphopeptide enrichment on TiO<sub>2</sub> beads (Thermo) and FeNTA beads (Thermo). Phosphopeptides were fractionated. Total proteome and enriched phosphopeptide fractions were separated on a 50 cm, 75 μm I.D. Pepmap column over a 2 h gradient and eluted directly into the Orbitrap Fusion Lumos, operated with Xcalibur software, with measurement in MS2 and MS3 modes. The instrument was set up in data-dependent acquisition mode, with top 10 most abundant peptides selected for MS/MS by HCD fragmentation.</p>
<p>Raw mass spectrometric data were processed in MaxQuant (version 1.6.12.0); database search against the <italic>Homo sapiens</italic> canonical sequences from UniProtKB was performed using the Andromeda search engine. Fixed modifications were set as Carbamidomethyl (C) and variable modifications set as Oxidation (M), Acetyl (Protein N-term) and Phospho (STY). The estimated false discovery rate was set to 1% at the peptide, protein, and site levels, with a maximum of two missed cleavages allowed. Reporter ion MS2 or Reporter ion MS3 was appropriately selected for each raw file.</p>
<p>Phosphorylation site tables were imported into Perseus (v1.6.14.0) for analysis. Contaminants and reverse peptides were cleaned up from the Phosphosites (STY) and the values normalised and averaged between MS2 and MS3 datasets using Z-score function across columns. All samples were analysed as triplicates, except PP1-Spinophilin and PP1-PNUTS, for which duplicates were used due to the presence of an outlier dataset as determined by principal component analysis. Phosphorylation site enrichments were compared using multiple t-test with permutation based false-discovery cutoff at 5% unless indicated otherwise. Enrichment data are summarised in Table S2.</p>

The data from the comprehensive approach using structural, biochemical, and computational methods are <bold>compelling</bold>, but the role of the crucial tryptophan residue in the recognition motif can be further tested to strengthen the main argument.

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this manuscript the Treisman and colleagues address the question of how protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) regulatory subunits (or PP1-interacting protein (PIPs)) confer specificity on the PP1 catalytic subunit which by itself possesses little substrate specificity. In prior work the authors showed that the PIP Phactrs confers specificity by remodelling a hydrophobic groove immediately adjacent to the PP1 catalytic site through residues within the RVxF- ø ø -R-W string of Phactrs. Specifically, the residues proximal and including the 'W' of the RVxF- ø ø -R-W string remodel the hydrophobic groove. Other residues of the RVxF- ø ø -R-W string (i.e. the RVxF- ø ø -R) are not involved in this remodelling.</p>
<p>The authors suggest that the RVxF- ø ø -R-W string is a conserved feature of many PIPs including PNUTS, Neurabin/spinophilin and R15A. However, from a sequence and structural perspective, only the RVxF- ø ø -R- is conserved. The W is not conserved in most and in the R15A structure (PDB:7NZM) the Trp side chain points away from the hydrophobic channel - this could be a questionable interpretation due to model-building into the low-resolution cryo-EM map (4 A).</p>
<p>In this paper, the authors convincingly show that Neurabin confers substrate specificity through interactions of its PDZ domain with the PDZ domain-binding motif (PBM) of 4E-BP. They show the PBM motif is required for Neurabin to increase PP1 activity towards 4E-BP and a synthetic peptide modelled on 4E-BP and also a synthetic peptide based on IRSp53 with a PBM added. The PBM of 4E-BP1 confers high affinity binding to the Neurabin PDZ domain. A crystal structure of a PP1-4E-BP1 fusion with Neurabin shows that the PBM of 4E-BP interacts with the PDZ domain of Neurabin. No interactions of 4E-BP and the catalytic site of PP1 are observed. Cell biology work showed that Neurabin-PP1 regulates the TOR signalling pathway by dephosphorylating 4E-BPs.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This work demonstrates convincingly using a variety of cell biology, proteomics, biophysics and structural biology that the PP1 interacting protein Neurabin confers specificity on PP1 through an interaction of its PDZ domain with a PDZ-binding motif of 4E-BP1 proteins. Remodelling of the hydrophobic groove of the PP1 catalytic subunit is not involved in Neurabin-dependent substrate specificity, in contrast to how Phactrs confers specificity on PP1. The active site of the Neurabin/PP1 complex does not recognise residues in the vicinity of the phospho-residue, thus allowing for multiple phospho-sites on 4E-BP to be dephosphorylated by Neurabin/PP1. This contrasts with substrate specificity conferred by the Phactrs PIP that confers specificity of Phactrs/PP1 towards its substrates in a sequence-specific context by remodelling the hydrophobic groove immediately adjacent to the catalytic. The structural and biochemical insights are used to explore the role of Neurabin/PP1 in dephosphorylation 4E-BPs in vivo, showing that Neurabin/PP1 regulates the TOR signalling pathway, specifically mTORC1-dependent translational control.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The only weakness is the suggestion that a conserved RVxF- ø ø -R-W string exists in PIPs. The 'W' is not conserved in sequence and 3 dimensions in most of the PIPs discussed in this manuscript. The lack of conservation of the W would be consistent with the finding based on multiple PP1-PIP structures that apart from Phactrs, no other PIP appears to remodel the PP1 hydrophobic channel.</p>

<p>This manuscript explores the molecular mechanisms that are involved in substrate recognition by the PP1 phosphatase. The authors previously showed that the PP1 interacting protein (PPI), PhactrI, conferred substrate specificity by remodelling the PP1 hydrophobic substrate groove. In this work, the authors aimed to understand the key determinant of how other PIPs, Neurabin and Spinophilin, mediate substrate recognition.</p>
<p>The authors generated a few PP1-PIP fusion constructs, undertook TMT phosphoproteomics and validated their method using PP1-Phactr1/2/3/4 fusion constructs. Using this method, the authors identified phsophorylation sites controlled by PP1-Neurabin and focussed their work on 4E-BP1, thereby linking PP1-Neurabin to mTORC1 signalling. Upon validating that PP1-Neurabin dephosphorylates 4E-BP1, they determined that 4E-BP1 PBM binds to the PDZ domain of Neurabin with an affinity that was greater than 30-fold as compared to other substrates. PP1-Neurabin dephosphorylated 4E-BP1WT and IRSp53WT with a catalytic efficiency much greater than PP1 alone. However, PP1-Neurabin bound to 4E-BP1 and IRSp53 mutants lacking the Neurabin PDZ domain with a catalytic efficiency lesser than that observed with 4E-BP1WT. These results indicate the involvement of the PDZ domain in facilitating substrate recruitment by PP1-Neurabin. Interestingly, PP1-Phactr1 dephosphorylation of 4E-BP1 phenocopies PP1 alone, while PP1-Phactr1 dephosphorylates IRSp53 to a much higher extent than PP1 alone. These results highlight the importance of the PDZ domain and also shed light on how different PP1-PIP holoenzymes mediate substrate recognition using distinct mechanisms. The authors also show that the remodelling of the hydrophobic PP1 substrate groove which is essential for substrate recognition by PP1-Phactr1, was not required by PP1-Neurabin. Additionally, the authors also resolved the structure of a PP1-4E-BP1 fusion with the PDZ-containing C-terminal of Neurabin and observed that the Neurabin/PP1-4E-BP1 complex structure was oriented at 21{degree sign} to that in the unliganded Spinophilin/PP1 complex (resolved by Ragusa et al., 2010) owing to a slight bend in the C-terminal section that connects it to the RVxF-ΦΦ-R-W string. Since no interaction was observed with the remodelled PP1-Neurabin hydrophobic groove, the authors utilised AlphaFold3 to further answer this. They observed a high confidence of interaction between the groove and phosphorylated substrate and a low confidence of interaction between the groove and unphosphorylated substrate, thereby suggesting that the hydrophobic groove remodelling is not involved in PP1-Neurabin recognition and dephosphorylation of 4E-BP1.</p>
<p>In this work, the authors provide novel insights into how Neurabin depends on the interaction between its PDZ domain and PBM domains of potential substrates to mediate its recruitment by PP1. Additionally, they uncover a novel PP1-Neurabin substrate, 4E-BP1. They systematically employ phosphoproteomics, biochemical, and structural methods to investigate substrate specificity in a robust fashion. Furthermore, the authors also compare the interactions between PP1-Neurabin to 4E-BP1 and IRSp53 (PP1-Phactr1 substrate) with PP1-Phactr1, to showcase the specificity of the mode of action employed by these complexes in mediating substrate specificity. The authors employ an innovative PP1-PIP fusion strategy previously explored by Oberoi et al., 2016 and the authors themselves in Fedoryshchak et al., 2020. Although this method, allows for a more controlled investigation of the interactions between PP1-PIPs and its substrates, this methodology may not fully recapitulate the interactions that may occur in a physiological setting. This could potentially be overcome by studying the interactions of the full proteins using classical biochemical approaches in cell lines. Furthermore, the authors have substantially characterised the importance of the PDZ domain using their fusion constructs, however, I believe that further exploration into either structural or AlphaFold3 modelling of PBM domain substrate mutants, or a Neurabin PDZ-domain mutant might further strengthen this claim. Overall, the paper makes a substantial contribution to understanding substrate recognition and specificity in PP1-PIP complexes. The study's innovative methods, biological relevance, and mechanistic insights are strengths, but whether this mechanism occurs in a physiological context is unclear.</p>

<p>Protein Phosphatase 1 (PP1), a vital member of the PPP superfamily, drives most cellular serine/threonine dephosphorylation. Despite PP1's low intrinsic sequence preference, its substrate specificity is finely tuned by over 200 PP1-interacting proteins (PIPs), which employ short linear motifs (SLIMs) to bind specific PP1 surface regions. By targeting PP1 to cellular sites, modifying substrate grooves, or altering surface electrostatics, PIPs influence substrate specificity. Although many PIP-PP1-substrate interactions remain uncharacterized, the Phactr family of PIPs uniquely imposes sequence specificity at dephosphorylation sites through a conserved &quot;RVxF-ΦΦ-R-W&quot; motif. In Phactr1-PP1, this motif forms a hydrophobic pocket that favors substrates with hydrophobic residues at +4/+5 in acidic contexts (the &quot;LLD motif&quot;), a specificity that endures even in PP1-Phactr1 fusions. Neurabin/Spinophilin remodel PP1's hydrophobic groove in distinct ways, creating unique holoenzyme surfaces, though the impact on substrate specificity remains underexplored. This study investigates Neurabin/Spinophilin specificity via PDZ domain-driven interactions, showing that Neurabin/PP1 specificity is governed more by PDZ domain interactions than by substrate sequence, unlike Phactr1/PP1.</p>
<p>A significant strength of this work is the use of PP1-PIP fusion proteins to effectively model intact PP1•PIP holoenzymes by replicating the interactions that remodel the PP1 interface and confer site-specific substrate specificity. When combined with proteomic analyses to assess phospho-site depletion in mammalian cells, these fusions offer critical insights into holoenzyme specificity, revealing new candidate substrates for Neurabin and Spinophilin. The studies present compelling evidence that the PDZ domain of PP1-Neurabin directs its specificity, with the remodelled PP1 hydrophobic groove interactions having minimal impact. This mechanism is supported by structural analysis of the PP1-4E-BP1 substrate fusion bound to a Neurabin construct, highlighting the 4E-BP1/PDZ interaction. This work delivers crucial insights into PP1-PIP holoenzyme function, combining biochemical, proteomic, and structural approaches. It validates the PP1-PIP fusion protein model as a powerful tool, suggesting it may extend to studying additional holoenzymes. While an extremely useful model, it must be considered unlikely the PP1-PIP fusions fully recapitulate the specificity and regulation of the holoenzyme.</p>

<p>We are very pleased to see these positive reviews of our preprint.</p>
<p>Reviewers 1 and 3 raise issues around PIP-PP1 interactions.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(1) Role of the “RVxF-ΦΦ-R-W string”</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Most PIPs interact with the globular PP1 catalytic core through short linear interaction motifs (SLiMs) and Choy et al (PNAS 2014) previously showed that many PIPs interact with PP1 through conserved trio of SLiMs, RVxF-ΦΦ-R, which is also present in the Phactrs.</p>
<p>Previous structural analysis showed the trajectory of the PPP1R15A/B, Neurabin/Spinphilin (PPP1R9A/B), and PNUTS (PPP1R10) PIPs across the PP1 surface encompasses not only the RVxF-ΦΦ-R trio, but also additional sequences C-terminal to it (Chen et al, eLife, 2015). This extended trajectory is maintained in the Phactr1-PP1 complex (Fedoryshchak et al, eLife (2020). Based on structural alignment we proposed the existence of an additional hydrophobic “W” SLiM that interacts with the PP1 residues I133 and Y134.</p>
<p>The extended “RVxF-ΦΦ-R-W” interaction brings sequences C-terminal to the “W” SLiM into the vicinity of the hydrophobic groove that adjoins the PP1 catalytic centre. In the Phactr1/PP1 complex, these sequences remodel the groove, generating a novel pocket that facilitates sequence-specific substrate recognition.</p>
<p>This raises the possibility that sequences C-terminal to the extended “RVxF-ΦΦ-R-W string” in the other complexes also confer sequence-specific substrate recognition, and our study aims to test this hypothesis. Indeed, the hydrophobic groove structures of the Neurabin/Spinophilin/PP1 and Phactr1/PP1 complexes differ significantly (Ragusa et al, 2010; see Fedoryshchak et al 2020, Fig2 FigSupp1).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) Orientation of the W side chain</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Reviewer 1 points out that in the substrate-bound PP1/PPP1R15A/Actin/eIF2 pre-dephosphorylation complex the W sidechain is inverted with respect to its orientation in  PP1-PPP1R15B complex (Yan et al, NSMB 2021). The authors proposed that this may reflect the role of actin in assembly of the quaternary complex. This does not necessarily invalidate the notion that sequences C-terminal to the “W” motif might play a role in actin-independent substrate recognition, and we therefore consider our inclusion of the R15A/B fusions in our analysis to be reasonable.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) Conservation of W</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The motif ‘W’ does not mandate tryptophan - Phactrs and PPP1R15A/B indeed have W at this position but Neurabin/spinophilin contain VDP, which makes similar interactions. Similarly the _“_RVxF” motifs in Phactr1, Neurabin/Spinophilin, PPP1R15A/B and PNUTS are LIRF, KIKF, KV(R/T)F and TVTW respectively.</p>
<p>In our revision, we will present comparisons of the differentially remodelled/modified PP1 hydrophobic groove in the various complexes, discuss the different orientations of the tryptophan in the previously published PPP1R15A/PP1 and PPP1R15B/PP1 structures. We will also address the other issues raised by the referees.</p>
