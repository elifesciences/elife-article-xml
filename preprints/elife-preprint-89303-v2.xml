<title>Abstract</title><p>Poly(ADP-ribose)ylation or PARylation by PAR polymerase 1 (PARP1) and dePARylation by poly(ADP-ribose) glycohydrolase (PARG) are equally important for the dynamic regulation of DNA damage response. PARG, the most active dePARylation enzyme, is recruited to sites of DNA damage via pADPr-dependent and PCNA-dependent mechanisms. Targeting dePARylation is considered an alternative strategy to overcome PARP inhibitor resistance. However, precisely how dePARylation functions in normal unperturbed cells remains elusive. To address this challenge, we conducted multiple CRISPR screens and revealed that dePARylation of S phase pADPr by PARG is essential for cell viability. Loss of dePARylation activity initially induced S phase-specific pADPr signaling, which resulted from unligated Okazaki fragments and eventually led to uncontrolled pADPr accumulation and PARP1/2-dependent cytotoxicity. Moreover, we demonstrated that proteins involved in Okazaki fragment ligation and/or base excision repair regulate pADPr signaling and cell death induced by PARG inhibition. In addition, we determined that PARG expression is critical for cellular sensitivity to PARG inhibition. Additionally, we revealed that PARG is essential for cell survival by suppressing pADPr. Collectively, our data not only identify an essential role for PARG in normal proliferating cells but also provide a potential biomarker for the further development of PARG inhibitors in cancer therapy.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation or PARylation is a conserved post-translational modification that is important for many cellular processes, including DNA damage repair<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. PARylation is mainly driven by poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1), and to a lesser extent by PARP2, using NAD+ as an ADP-ribose donor and generating nicotinamide (NAM) as a byproduct in human cells. Extensive studies have already established the key roles of PARP1/2 in DNA damage response (DDR)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>. As a DNA damage sensor, PARP1 rapidly recognizes and binds to DNA damage sites, which dramatically activates its own enzymatic activity and thereby modifies itself and other proteins with pADPr and mono-(ADP-ribosylation). These modifications lead to the recruitment of proteins that are involved in DDR and DNA repair. The binding to DNA by activated PARP1 acts as a “hit and run” mechanism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>, which restricts PARylation at a specific point and facilitates the subsequent engagement of other repair proteins. Thus, PARylation by PARP1, when responding to DNA damage, is a rapid and transient process. In addition, PARP1 can be activated by unligated Okazaki fragments to induce endogenous S phase pADPr, which then recruits XRCC1 and LIG3 to facilitate the ligation of these Okazaki fragments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>PARylation is a reversible post-translational modification. The removal of pADPr is mainly carried out by poly(ADP-ribose) glycohydrolase (PARG)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. However, PARG cannot remove the terminal ADP-ribose, whose removal requires additional hydrolases, including terminal ADP-ribose glycohydrolase (TARG1), ADP-ribose-acceptor hydrolases ARH1/3, and possibly other macrodomain-containing proteins, such as hMacroD1/D2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. Later studies showed that PARG and ARH3 (ADPRHL2/ADPRS) are the primary dePARylation enzymes in vertebrates, although ARH3 has much lower activity against pADPr than PARG and mainly functions as a serine-directed mono-ADP-ribosylhydrolase<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. As an endo-glycohydrolase and exo-glycohydrolase, PARG specifically hydrolyzes the glycosidic bonds. PARG may function as an oncogene, as the high level of PARG promotes cell transformation and invasion and is associated with poor overall survival<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. Moreover, complete loss of PARG leads to embryonic lethality in mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. Importantly, PARG is recruited to sites of DNA damage by PARP1- or pADPr-dependent and PCNA-dependent mechanisms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup> and involved in both DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) and single-strand breaks (SSBs) repair. Loss of PARG sensitizes cells to DNA damage agents<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. In addition, PARG is also involved in transactions at replication forks<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>On average, a single cell suffers thousands of DNA damage events every day<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>; PARylation and dePARylation occur rapidly and collaboratively to facilitate DNA repair in the cell. This rapid PARylation and dePARylation cycle is likely important for homeostasis regulation. Unrestrained PARylation following DNA damage may lead to a significant change in the NAD+ level in cells, which not only inhibits other cellular processes that require NAD+ but also results in cell death due to NAD+ depletion and/or PARP1-dependent cell death called Parthanatos<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. Thus, PARG and other dePARylation enzymes are critically important for the recycling of NAD+ and the control of NAD+ homeostasis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Targeting PARylation and dePARylation is a promising strategy in cancer and other therapies. PARP inhibitors (PARPis) have already been approved for clinical treatment of cancers with homologous recombination (HR) deficiency, while targeting dePARylation is an encouraging alternative strategy to overcome PARPi resistance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>. Given the critical roles of PARG in the maintenance of the PARylation/dePARylation cycle in cells, PARG inhibitors have been developed recently as potential anti-cancer agents<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>. These include PDD00017273 (PARGi) (<bold>Fig. S1A</bold>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>, COH34<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>, and JA2131<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>. Interestingly, cells with deficiency in HR and other DNA damage signaling/repair pathways showed increased sensitivity to the PARG inhibitors PDD00017273 and COH34<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>. These PARG inhibitors could also sensitize cells to radiation therapy and chemotherapy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>. Thus, there is significant interest in further developing these PARG inhibitors for cancer treatment.</p>
<p>Despite the crucial role of PARG in dePARylation in multiple pathways, detailed knowledge of its mechanism of action remains elusive. Especially, how PARG regulates dePARylation in normal unperturbed cells and the balance between PARylation and dePARylation remain unclear. To address this issue, we performed multiple CRISPR screens and created PARP1/2 DKO, PARG KO, and additional KO cells. We showed that loss of dePARylation activity induced S phase-specific pADPr signaling, which likely originated from unligated Okazaki fragments. Consequently, the failure to remove S phase pADPr led to PARylation- or PARP1/2-dependent cell death. Furthermore, perturbation of Okazaki fragment ligation and/or base excision repair (BER) increased pADPr signaling and promoted cell death induced by PARGi. In addition, we revealed that the PARG level is a potential biomarker for PARGi-based cancer therapy. Moreover, we showed that PARG is essential for cell survival, which can be exploited for cancer treatment.</p>

<title>PARG depletion leads to drastic sensitivity to PARGi</title>
<p>The results of early studies indicated that defective DNA repair pathways and DNA replication stress would result in enhanced sensitivity to PARG inhibitor, PDD00017273 (PARGi)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>.

Interestingly, our screen results showed that PARG depletion led to significantly increased cellular sensitivity to PARGi (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>, Table S1</bold>). In addition, we found that POLB (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref></bold>), which is important for BER, a repair pathway that relies on PARP1 functions and pADPr-dependent DNA damage signaling, also showed synthetic lethality with PARGi. The synthetic lethality between POLB and PARGi was consistent with the findings of a previous report<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>, indicating the high quality of our screening results.</p>

<p>To further validate our data, we generated PARG KO cells in the same 293A cells used in DDR sgRNA library screening. Interestingly, PARG KO cells showed extreme sensitivity to PARGi, with nearly thousand-fold sensitivity (the IC<sub>50</sub> in 293A cells was 96±24 µM and 210±30 nM in PARG KO cells, on the basis of five independent biological replicates) (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref></bold>). In addition, we used another two structurally similar compounds (PDD00017272 and PDD00017238) to further confirm the extreme sensitivity of PARG KO cells to PARG inhibition (<bold>Fig. S1B</bold>), while the inactive but structurally similar compound PDD0031705 did not distinguish wild-type (WT) or PARG KO cells (<bold>Fig. S1C</bold>). To further validate that this sensitivity was not restricted to one cell line, we generated HeLa-derived PARG KO cells with a different gRNA. As expected, HeLa-derived PARG KO cells also displayed extreme sensitivity to PARGi (<bold>Fig. S1D</bold>). These results suggest that PARG depletion resulted in drastic sensitivity to PARGi.</p>
<p>We reconstituted PARG KO cells with WT PARG or a PARG catalytic-inactive mutant E755/756A<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup> to further investigate the nature of PARGi sensitivity in PARG KO cells. Cells treated with the alkylating agent methyl methanesulfonate (MMS), which is known to activate pADPr signaling, were used to test PARG activity. As shown in <bold>Fig. S1E</bold>, PARG KO cells and cells reconstituted with PARG catalytically inactive mutant showed a significant increase in pADPr signaling induced by MMS, while WT cells or cells reconstituted with WT PARG did not. Expectedly, reconstitution with WT PARG reversed the sensitivity of PARG KO cells to PARGi, while reconstitution with PARG catalytic inactive mutant failed to do so (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref></bold>). Together, these data strongly suggest that loss of PARG activity induces dramatic sensitivity to PARGi.</p>
<p>The question is why PARG KO cells would be sensitive to PARGi. There are at least two potential explanations for this observation. First, PARGi may target not only PARG but also a second target, which only becomes essential in the absence of PARG. Second, our PARG KO cells, despite being generated with two different sgRNAs and in two independent cell lines validated by Western blotting and DNA sequencing, are not complete PARG KO cells. The two different sgRNAs used here target all three catalytically active isoforms (isoforms 1, 2 and 3), and sgRNA#2 used in HeLa cells also targets isoforms 4 and 5, but these two isoforms are considered catalytically inactive according to the Uniprot database (<bold>Fig. S1D</bold>). To address this important question, we performed several experiments to test both hypotheses. Please see below for additional studies.</p>

<p>We reason that sensitivity to PARGi in PARG KO cells may depend on PARP1/2-dependent pADPr accumulation. To test this hypothesis, CellTiter-Glo and a colony formation assay were used to detect the sensitivity of WT, PARG KO, PARP1/2 DKO, and PARG/PARP1/2 TKO cells to PARGi. As expected, the sensitivity of PARG KO to PARGi was completely reversed in TKO cells, and DKO cells showed moderate resistance compared with WT cells (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref></bold>). Indeed, TKO cells completely rescued cell death induced by PARGi in PARG KO cells (<bold>Fig. S2C</bold>). In addition, treatment with PARPi olaparib was able to reverse PARGi sensitivity in PARG KO cells (<bold>Fig. S2C</bold>). These data together suggest that the cytotoxicity of PARGi in PARG KO cells was due to uncontrolled PARylation, which requires PARP1/2.</p>
<p>PARP1/2 catalyzes the pADPr reaction by transferring the ADR-ribose moiety of NAD<sup>+</sup> to the acceptor proteins with the release of NAM<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>. Uncontrolled PARylation may lead to cytotoxicity, at least in part because of NAD<sup>+</sup> depletion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>. To determine whether cell death induced by PARGi in PARG KO cells is at least partially caused by NAD<sup>+</sup> depletion, we measured the relative NAD<sup>+</sup> level in WT and PARG KO cells treated with PARGi and used the nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT) inhibitor FK866 as a positive control. FK866 is a noncompetitive inhibition of NAMPT, a key enzyme involved in the regulation of NAD+ biosynthesis from its natural precursor NAM <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup>. As expected, the NAD<sup>+</sup> level decreased modestly over the treatment period in PARG KO cells, but this decrease was not as dramatic as those observed in cells treated with FK866 (<bold>Fig. S2D</bold>). Moreover, treatment with FK866, which significantly decreased the NAD+ level, did not lead to cell death (<bold>Fig. S2E</bold>), suggesting that the decreased NAD+ level is not sufficient or the only reason for the cytotoxicity observed in PARG KO cells treated with PARGi. Furthermore, we treated cells with the NAD+ precursors nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) or NAM<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup>. As expected, NMN, NAM, and PARPi rescued the NAD<sup>+</sup> decrease in both non-treated and PARGi treated cells (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref></bold>). In addition, NMN and NAM were able to not only reduce pADPr accumulation induced by long-term PARGi treatment (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref></bold>), but also rescue cell lethality caused by PARGi treatment in both HEK293A-derived and HeLa-derived PARG KO cells (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2F</xref></bold> and <bold>S2F</bold>). Together, these results suggest that uncontrolled PARylation in the absence of any dePARylation activities would lead to cytotoxicity, probably due to several mechanisms including apoptosis and are not limited to NAD+ depletion/reduction.</p>

<title>Unexpected S phase pADPr signaling observed in PARG KO cells treated with PARGi</title>
<p>PARP1/2 are activated by DNA damage to generate pADPr signals. Under normal growth conditions, PARP1/2 activities may be low; therefore, it was extremely difficult to detect pADPr. Unexpectedly, pADPr signaling from normal proliferating cells without any exogenous DNA damage was detected in PARG KO cells after PARGi treatment (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref></bold> and <bold>S2B</bold>), which was apparent in S phase cells, as detected by FACS analysis (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref></bold>). To further characterize pADPr and DNA damage signaling induced by PARGi or other DNA damaging agents, we used flow cytometry to detect both pADPr and γH2AX signaling (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref></bold> and <bold>S3A</bold>). Interestingly, pADPr signaling was specifically detected in S phase in PARG KO cells treated with PARGi, while at the same time, DNA damage signaling only showed a slight increase or was not observed, as revealed by anti-γH2AX antibody (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref></bold>). On the other hand, MMS treatment led to increased pADPr signaling throughout the cell cycle (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref></bold>). However, it only led to an S phase-specific increase in DNA damage signaling, i.e. γH2AX. Our interpretation of the MMS results is that MMS treatment would lead to DNA alkylation throughout the cell cycle, which is repaired by the BER pathway. BER creates single-strand nicks as repair intermediates, which are recognized by PARP1 and activate PARP1. Therefore, pADPr signaling can be detected in all cell cycle phases in PARG KO cells under this condition. However, single-strand nicks are not recognized by DNA damage checkpoint pathways. These nicks, when encountering replication forks, will be converted to DSBs and therefore activate DNA damage checkpoint kinases, resulting in increased γH2AX signaling specifically in S phase cells.</p>

<p>To further explore the relationship between pADPr and γH2AX signaling, we conducted a similar flow cytometry analysis in parental WT and PARG KO cells following treatments with different DNA damaging agents. Again, PARGi treatment in PARG KO cells led to an S phase-specific increase in pADPr signaling; this unique pattern was not detected in response to any of the DNA damaging agents used in this study (<bold>Fig. S3A</bold>). Our current working hypothesis is that PARG KO cells treated with PARGi may completely block any dePARylation reactions. The dramatic S phase-specific pADPr signaling detected under this condition indicates that PARP1 is specifically activated in S phase cells.</p>
<p>During DNA replication, maturation of Okazaki fragments involves single-strand nicks on DNA, which is normally ligated by LIG1. These unligated Okazaki fragment intermediates could activate PARP1 to generate endogenous S phase pADPr<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>. It is possible that in such situations, the maturation of Okazaki fragments may require PARP1-dependent recruitment of XRCC1/LIG3<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>, which agrees with the results of early studies that indicate that both LIG1 and LIG3 are required for Okazaki fragment maturation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup>. Of course, PARP1 may have other functions in the S phase, including DNA repair<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>The S phase pADPr signaling observed in PARG KO cells after PARGi treatment was observed under conditions in which no or very limited DNA damage or replication stress– induced signaling was detected by anti-γH2AX antibody (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref></bold>) and S phase pADPr resulting from unligated Okazaki fragments were observed under similar conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>; thus, we reasoned that unligated Okazaki fragments in normal proliferating cells may render this unexpected S phase pADPr signaling in PARG KO cells after PARGi treatment. Indeed, pre-treatment with emetine, which diminishes Okazaki fragments by its anti-protein synthetic activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup>, greatly inhibited S phase pADPr signaling in PARG KO cells (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref></bold>). Furthermore, mild inhibition of POLA1 with two inhibitors (i.e. adarotene and CD437) also abolished the PARGi induced S phase pADPr signaling in PARG KO cells (<bold>Fig. S3B</bold>).</p>
<p>To further support S phase-specific pADPr signaling resulting from unligated Okazaki fragments, we performed double thymidine block (DTB) and release experiments. Indeed, release into S phase is critical for the pADPr signaling observed in PARG KO cells treated with PARGi (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref></bold>). Moreover, the cytotoxicity of PARGi also requires S phase progression, since both control proliferating cells and double thymidine blocked and released cells died following PARGi treatment, while cells arrested by DTB failed to do so (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref></bold>). Additionally, mild inhibition of POLA1 partially rescued the cytotoxicity of PARGi in PARG KO cells (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E</xref></bold>).</p>

<title>PARG KO cells show prolonged PARP1 chromatin binding</title>
<p>Following DNA damage, PARP1 detects and is activated by both SSBs and DSBs to initiate subsequent DNA repair<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></sup>. After that, PARP1 dissociates from DNA. If this does not occur, the persistent PARP1-DNA complexes could trap PARP1 on chromatin, which is one of the key characteristics of PARPi-mediated cytotoxicity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>. Given that the sensitivity of PARG KO cells to PARGi resulted from PARP1/2-dependent pADPr accumulation, which indicates an association and activation of PARP1/2 by DNA, we used a previously described trapping assay to measure the levels of chromatin-bound PARP1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>. Unexpectedly, the levels of chromatin-bound PARP1/2 increased in PARG KO cells, regardless of treatment, while the soluble fraction of PARP1 decreased compared with that in WT cells (<bold>Fig. S4A</bold>).</p>
<p>To further explore the chromatin-bound PARP1, we performed similar soluble and chromatin fractionation and enrichment of PARylated proteins by Af1521 beads. Consistently, chromatin-bound PARP1 increased in PARG KO cells, regardless of whether these cells were treated with PARGi (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref></bold>). Moreover, PARylated PARP1 also increased in chromatin fraction. Interestingly, following PARGi treatment, PARG KO cells showed more pADPr levels than did WT cells in chromatin fraction, while similar pADPr levels were detected in soluble fractions (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref></bold>). Indeed, a recent study by Gogola and colleagues suggest that PARG depletion does not enhance PARP1 dissociation from DNA but prevents excessive PARP1 binding, on the basis of the results of a similar trapping assay and a laser-induced DNA damage assay for measuring PARP1 association<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref></sup>. Taken together, these results indicate that prolonged PARP1 chromatin binding or trapping occurs in PARG KO cells, which may contribute to the sensitivity of these cells to PARGi.</p>

</fig>
<p>To further support the contribution of chromatin-bound PARP1 to PARGi sensitivity, we introduced either WT PARP1 or a trapping-deficient PARP1<sup>del.p.119K120S</sup> construction into TKO cells (<bold>Fig. S4B</bold>). PARP1<sup>del.p.119K120S</sup> mutant is a trapping-deficient mutant, which leads to PARPi resistance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref></sup>. Notably, expression of WT PARP1 led to dramatic PARGi sensitivity in TKO cells, while PARP1<sup>del.p.119K120S</sup> mutant only showed a slight increase in PARGi sensitivity (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref></bold>). Together, these data suggest that increased chromatin-bound and trapped PARP1 contributes, at least in part, to the sensitivity of these cells to PARGi.</p>
<p>To investigate the consequence of S phase pADPr and prolonged PARP1 chromatin binding in PARG KO cells, we again used flow cytometry to detect pADPr signaling in a time course following PARGi treatment. Consistent with the aforementioned data, S phase pADPr was detected following short PARGi treatment (i.e. 4 hours), while pADPr signaling was detected throughout the cell cycle following prolonged PARGi treatment, i.e. 24 or 48 hours (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref></bold>). Furthermore, SSBs were not detected following short PARGi treatment, as measured by an alkaline comet assay (<bold>Fig. S4C</bold>), which may due to the sensitivity of this assay. However, prolonged PARGi treatment in PARG KO cells led to dramatic increase of SSBs detected by this assay (<bold>Fig. S4C</bold>). Similarly, we observed S phase-specific pADPr signaling with short PARGi treatment and pADPr signaling throughout the cell cycle with prolonged PARGi treatment in HeLa PARG KO cells, although significant S-phase pADPr was detected in control WT HeLa cells (<bold>Fig. S4D</bold>), which was not observed in control WT 293A cells (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref></bold>). The difference in pADPr signaling between HeLa and 293A cells may due to a low level of PARG and/or high activity of PARP1 in HeLa cells, in which high–molecular weight smears were detected following PARGi and MMS treatment (<bold>Fig. S4E</bold>). Together, these data indicate that PARG regulates S-phase pADPr in normal proliferating cells.</p>
<p>To further confirm pADPr signaling observed by flow cytometry analysis, we detected pADPr and γH2AX by Western blotting in HEK293A and HeLa cells and their corresponding PARG KO cells, while additional MMS treatment was included as a positive control (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref></bold> and <bold>S4F</bold>). Expectedly, we only observed increased γH2AX signaling in PARG KO cells with prolonged PARGi treatment (48 hours of treatment in 293A PARG KO cells and 24 and 48 hours of treatment in HeLa PARG KO cells) or those treated with additional MMS, indicating that pADPr accumulation leads to DNA damage throughout the cell cycle. The pADPr signaling in PARG KO cells pre-treated with PARGi was further enhanced in MMS-treated cells (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref></bold> and <bold>S4F</bold>), likely due to increased SSBs; nevertheless, PARGi-mediated pADPr accumulation in PARG KO cells under condition without any exogenous DNA damage was sufficient to cause cytotoxicity. This situation is different from the hyperactivity and progressive inactivation of PARP1 in XRCC1-deficient cells after MMS treatment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>. Taken together, we speculate that inhibition of dePARylation in PARG KO cells treated with PARGi lead to pADPr accumulation and cell lethality.</p>

<title>CRISPR screens reveal genes responsible for regulating pADPr signaling and/or cell lethality in WT and PARG KO cells</title>
<p>PARG KO and PARGi appear to have a synergic effect on cell viability, which depends on PARP1/2-dependent pADPr accumulation (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref></bold> and <bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></bold>). Further, we showed that unligated Okazaki fragments were the likely source of SSBs, which leads to S phase pADPr signaling (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref></bold>). Moreover, we found that uncontrolled S phase pADPr accumulation eventually leads to DNA damage, as revealed by anti-γH2AX antibody and alkaline comet assay (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref></bold>). These data prompted us to further explore potential genes that may be responsible for controlling cell viability and pADPr signaling in control WT and PARG KO cells, with or without PARGi treatment. As we speculated above, there may be a potential second gene targeted by PARGi, which only becomes essential in the absence of PARG. We thus performed the outlined whole-genome CRISPR screens to address these questions (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref></bold>), similar to the studies published by us and others<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref></sup>.</p>

</fig>
<p>As for FACS-based CRISPR screening, we showed that PARP1 consistently appeared as the gene that, when depleted, led to reduced pADPr in all settings (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref></bold>, <bold>S5A</bold> and <bold>Table S2-4</bold>), which agrees with the dominant role of PARP1 in promoting PARylation in cells. The depleted genes that led to increased pADPr signaling were also similar in all of these settings (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref></bold> and <bold>S5A</bold>); these include BER genes (i.e. POLB, XRCC1, LIG3, and CHD1L) and genes involved in DNA replication/Okazaki fragment maturation (i.e. RFCs, FEN1, and LIG1). Interestingly, ARH3 only appeared in PARG KO cells treated with PARGi (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref></bold> and <bold>S5A</bold>), indicating that as anticipated ARH3 may serve as a backup dePARylating enzyme.</p>
<p>We further investigated whether the aforementioned genes that regulated pADPr signaling would show strong synthetic lethality with PARGi in both PARG KO cells (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref></bold> and <bold>Table S5</bold>) and WT cells (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D</xref></bold> and <bold>Table S6</bold>). To identify the most confident hits, we used a stringent false discovery rate (FDR) threshold of 0.05<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref></sup>. Consistently, PARP1 was listed as the most resistant gene with PARGi in PARG KO cells (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref></bold>). Interestingly, ARH3 appeared as the top gene in PARG KO cells treated with PARGi (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref></bold>), while other dePARylation enzymes (e.g. MARCROD1/2 andTARG1/OARD1) did not show any synthetic lethal effect in these screens. These data agree with the results of FACS-based screens and suggest that ARH3 is a backup enzyme in the absence of PARG following PARGi treatment. Indeed, loss of ARH3 further sensitized PARG KO cells to PARGi (<bold>Fig. S5B</bold>). In addition, HPF1, another gene/protein involved in PARylation regulation and licensing serine mono-ADP-ribosylation by PARP1/2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref></sup>, was among the top synthetic lethality genes in PARG KO cells treated with PARGi, but not in WT cells (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C,D</xref></bold> and <bold>S5C</bold>).</p>
<p>Thus, our CRISPR screens revealed that genes involved in PARylation regulation (ARH3 and HPF1), BER (i.e. POLB, XRCC1, LIG3, and CHD1L), and DNA replication/Okazaki fragment maturation (i.e. RFCs, FEN1, and LIG1) are responsible for pADPr signaling and/or cell lethality in WT and PARG KO cells.</p>
<p>To further explore the involvement of these aforementioned genes, we compared synthetic lethality genes in PARG KO cells with those in WT cells treated with PARGi. Interestingly, two BER key genes, POLB and XRCC1, showed strong synthetic lethality with PARGi in both PARG KO cells (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref></bold>) and WT cells (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D</xref></bold>), which is consistent with the results of a previous report that POLB-deficient cells are sensitive to PARGi<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>. Moreover, the GO analysis revealed that the BER pathway displays synthetic lethality in both PARG KO cells and WT cells following PARGi treatment (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5E</xref></bold>). Importantly, LIG1 and LIG3, the two ligases that are directly involved in Okazaki fragment ligation, were also listed as synthetic lethality genes (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref></bold> and <bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5D</xref></bold>). To further validate these data, we created several KO/KD cell lines, including KO of BER genes (i.e. POLB and XRCC1) and genes involved in Okazaki fragment ligation (i.e. LIG1 and LIG3) (<bold>Fig. S5D</bold>). Consistent with previous reports, XRCC1 loss destabilizes LIG3 (<bold>Fig. S5D</bold>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref></sup>. Notably, loss of genes involved in Okazaki fragment ligation induced S phase pADPr signaling, just like PARG KO cells following PARGi treatment, while loss of BER genes resulted in pADPr signaling throughout the cell cycle (<bold>Fig. S5E</bold>). These results agree with the aforementioned results that unligated Okazaki fragments are the likely source of SSBs, which induces S phase-specific pADPr signaling. Also consistent with CRISPR screening data, loss of genes involved in Okazaki fragment ligation or BER resulted in increased sensitivity to PARGi (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5E</xref></bold>). Furthermore, we knocked down POLB in WT and PARG KO cells (<bold>Fig. S5F</bold>), which resulted in increased sensitivity to PARGi in both WT and PARG KO cells (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5G</xref></bold>). Together, our data indicate that unligated Okazaki fragments induce S phase-specific pADPr, while BER intermediates lead to pADPr throughout the cell cycle; deficiency in either of these events would increase cytotoxicity following PARGi treatment.</p>

<title>PARG expression is a potential biomarker for PARGi-induced cytotoxicity</title>
<p>We showed that cells with no detectable full-length PARG expression are extremely sensitive to PARG inhibition (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref></bold> and <bold>S1</bold>). Thus, we are interested in determining whether PARG expression would correlate with PARGi sensitivity. An early study examined a panel of ovarian cancer cell lines and reported PARGi sensitivity in a subset of these cell lines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>. We compared PARG expression in PARGi sensitive and resistant cell lines and found that PARG expression was significantly reduced in PARGi sensitive cell lines (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref></bold>). To support this result, we knocked down PARG by shRNA in HeLa cells and showed that loss or further reduction of PARG led to dramatic sensitivity to PARGi (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref></bold>). To further test our hypothesis, we ranked the PARG mRNA level in several ovarian cancer cell lines using the CCLE database (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C</xref></bold>). We identified an ovarian cancer cell line, RMUGS, which has low PARG expression, similar to that observed in another known PARGi sensitive cell line, KURAMOCHI. Notably, RMUGS cells were considered as potential PARGi-resistant cells based on an earlier report<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>. However, we showed that RMUGS cells were very sensitive to PARGi treatment (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6D</xref></bold>), and the sensitivity of these cells to PARGi could be reversed by PARPi treatment (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6E</xref></bold>).

<p>An early study reported that loss of PARG expression resulted in PARPi resistance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref></sup>. They demonstrated that PARG is frequently lost in acquired PARPi-resistant mouse mammary tumors and further revealed that PARG depletion occurs in triple-negative breast and ovarian cancer. Another study showed that 60 of 274 (22%) of human ovarian tumors have low PARG expression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>. Thus, PARGi can be potentially used to treat these PARPi-resistant cancers, especially those with low PARG expression. We further performed an IHC assay to detect PARG expression in breast and ovarian cancer TMA samples. The IHC assay was established with the use of our xenograft tumors derived from HeLa and HeLa PARG KO cells (data not shown). As shown in <bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6F</xref></bold>, PARG expression was detected in normal ovarian and breast tissues. PARG expression was also detected in a majority or most of ovarian and breast tumor samples (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6F</xref></bold>). Interestingly, about 5% to 40% of these breast or ovarian cancer tumor samples showed low expression levels of PARG, some even showed no detectable level of PARG, compared with those in normal tissue samples (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6F</xref></bold>). These data suggest that PARG downregulation occurs in breast and ovarian cancers. PARGi may be a promising strategy for the treatment of these cancers with low PARG expression.</p>
<p>In early studies, HR-deficient cells showed increased sensitivity to PARG inhibition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref></sup>. Similarly, we observed PARGi-induced cytotoxicity in RPE1 Flag-Cas9 TP53/BRCA1 DKO cells, but not in control cells (<bold>Fig. S6A</bold>). Moreover, combining PARPi and PARGi did not reveal any additive effect (<bold>Fig. S6A</bold>). Furthermore, we created inducible BRCA1 depletion cells using the auxin-inducible degron (mAID) tag. As shown in <bold>Figure S6B</bold>, HR-proficient cells showed normal sensitivity to PARGi, while HR deficiency by the loss of BRCA1 conferred modest sensitivity to PARGi. The PARGi sensitivity in BRCA1 depletion cells was reversed to normal by the restoration of HR due to 53BP1 loss. Consistent with the results obtained in RPE1 cells, the PARPi+PARGi combination did not lead to any further change in cytotoxicity. While these results indicate that PARGi can be used to target HR-deficient cancers, the effect is quite modest. Moreover, PARGi treatment did not show any effect on PARPi-resistant cells due to restoration of HR mediated by 53BP1 loss.</p>
<p>To further investigate the potential contribution of HR deficiency and/or PARG loss to PARGi sensitivity, we knocked down PARG by shRNA in these inducible BRCA1 depletion cells with or without 53BP1 KO (<bold>Fig. S7A</bold>). As expected, PARG loss is the main driver of PARGi sensitivity; regardless whether these cells are HR-proficient, HR-deficient, or HR-restored because of 53BP1 loss (<bold>Fig. S7B</bold>). Our data therefore strongly suggest that PARG expression is the major determinant of PARGi sensitivity.</p>

<title>PARG is essential for cell survival</title>
<p>Our results suggested that cells with no detectable full-length PARG expression or low expression of PARG are extremely sensitive to PARG inhibition (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref></bold> and <bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref></bold>). As aforementioned, the question is why PARG KO cells would be sensitive to PARGi. To address this question, we first performed whole-genome CRISPR screening. However, the potential second target was not revealed by our CRISPR screening data (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref></bold>). The second possibility is that our PARG KO cells are not complete PARG KO cells. These cells may have residual PARG expression or activity and only cells with very low PARG expression are sensitive to PARGi, as shown in <bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref></bold>. Indeed, two independent Parg knockout mice have been created by targeting early exons of PARG<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref></sup>. While one group of Parg knockout mice showed embryonic lethality and cells derived from these mice only survived in the presence of PARPi<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>, the other Parg knockout mice did not display any major phenotypes, probably because truncated Parg and Parg activity were still detected<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref></sup>. We favor the second possibility, especially since the PARG catalytic domain is at its C-terminus.</p>
<p>To test this possibility, we first used two independent antibodies that recognize the C-terminus of PARG to detect potential residual PARG isoforms or spliced variants (<bold>Fig. S9A</bold>). Unfortunately, besides full-length PARG, these antibodies also recognized several other bands, some of them were reduced or absent in PARG KO cells, others were not. Thus, we could not draw a clear conclusion which functional isoform/truncated form was expressed in our PARG KO cells. Then, we used two additional gRNAs which target respectively the beginning of the catalytic domain and the sequence around the catalytic site (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7A</xref></bold>). Interestingly, we were only able to obtain viable clones with no detectable PARG in the presence of PARPi in either 293A or HeLa cells, which we named as PARG complete/conditional KO cells (cKO) (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7B</xref></bold>). Indeed, these cKO cells could not survive without PARPi (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7C</xref></bold>). To further investigate whether cell lethality is associated with PARG activity in these cells, we reconstituted PARG cKO cells with WT PARG or a PARG catalytic-inactive mutant. Consistent with previous result (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref></bold> and <bold>S1</bold>), WT PARG not only reduced pADPr level but also rescued cell lethality due to PARG loss, while the catalytic-inactive mutant PARG failed to do so (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7D</xref></bold>).</p>

<p>The data above indicate that our PARG KO cells have residual PARG activity and treatment with PARGi in these cells further decreases PARG activity, which mimic the complete loss of PARG as that in PARG cKO cells. To further test this hypothesis, we measured the relative PARG dePARylation activity in whole cell lysates (WCL) prepared from different cell lines (<bold>Fig. S9C</bold>). Consistent with our working hypothesis, residual PARG activity was detected in WCL prepared from PARG KO cells, while PARG activity was barely detected or absent in WCL isolated from PARG cKO cells. Please note that we incubated cell lysates with substrates overnight to evaluate the maximum level of pADPr hydrolysis, i.e. PARG activity, we were able to detect in these assays. It is very likely that the PARG activity in PARG KO cells was much lower than that indicated in <bold>Fig. S9C</bold>, due to saturation of signals for lysates isolated from wild-type cells. Thus, the data presented here may under-estimate the reduction of PARG activity in PARG KO cells. Nevertheless, these data indicate the residual PARG activity in PARG KO cells, which is absent in PARG cKO cells. Furthermore, the PARG activity was further inhibited by PARGi in a dose-dependent manner in WCLs prepared from both WT and PARG KO cells (<bold>Fig. S9D-E</bold>). Notably, the PARG activity was consistently lower in WCL prepared from PARG KO cells when compared with that in control wild-type cells in the presence of a wide range of PARGi concentrations. However, a significant fraction of PARG activity still existed in WCL prepared from wild-type cells even at the highest concentration of PARGi used in this study (<bold>Fig. S9E</bold>). These data indicate residual PARG activity in PARG KO cells likely accounts for the survival of these cells. Moreover, further inhibition of this activity by PARGi likely leads to cell lethality.</p>
<p>We showed above that NAD<sup>+</sup> precursors (NAM and NMN) were able to rescue cytotoxicity of PARGi in PARG KO cells, probably by NAD<sup>+</sup> depletion and also that these precuresors can also inhibit PARP1/2 activities. Consistently, PARG cKO cells could survive in the presence of NAD<sup>+</sup> precursors (NAM and NMN) (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7E</xref></bold>). Taken together, PARG is an essential gene and our PARG KO cells treated with PARGi can mimic the complete loss of PARG activity. These data agree with the genetically engineered mouse models as we discussed above<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>We showed that S phase pADPr signals were specifically detected in PARG KO cells treated with PARGi, which likely originated from unligated Okazaki fragments (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref></bold>). As expectedly, we observed S phase-specific pADPr in PARG cKO cells under double-thymidine block and release condition (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7F</xref></bold>). Moreover, the levels of chromatin-bound PARP1 and pADPr signal, which reflects PARylated PARP1 and/or other PARP1 substrates, increased in PARG cKO cells (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7G</xref></bold>). Treatment with PARPi decreased pADPr signals but increased chromatin-bound PARP1 (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7G</xref></bold>), which is consistent with the results obtained in PARG KO cells (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref></bold>). Together, PARG, as an essential gene, suppresses initial S phase pADPr signaling and PARP1 chromatin accumulation, which eventually lead to cell death caused by uncontrolled pADPr accumulation throughout cell cycle.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Aberrant accumulation of pADPr and/or NAD<sup>+</sup> exhaustion disrupts multiple cell processes, including DNA repair, replication stress response, and transcription regulation; therefore, it is highly toxic and eventually leads to cell death<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref></sup>. Although ADP-ribose hydrolases, especially PARG, have a protective effect against excessive PARP1 engagement, it remains unclear when and how PARG activity is engaged during normal cell proliferation. In this study, we showed that the major function of PARG is to regulate S phase-specific pADPr by PARP1, which is activated by unligated Okazaki fragments. When PARG activity is inhibited, these uncontrolled pADPr would eventually result in DNA damage and cell death. Using unbiased FACS- and cell viability-based genome-wide CRISPR screens, we uncovered additional pADPr modulators, which include the genes involved in BER (POLB, XRCC1, and LIG3), Okazaki maturation (LIG1 and FEN1), ARH3, and HPF1. More importantly, we determined that PARG expression is a critical biomarker for PARGi sensitivity. Furthermore, we showed that PARG is an essential gene by suppressing pADPr accumulation. Taken together, our study uncovers a normal function of PARG in proliferating cells: it removes pADPr generated by PARP1 at unligated Okazaki fragments during DNA replication. Of course, this normal function of PARG is also required under conditions of excessive PARP1 engagement because of defects in Okazaki fragment maturation and/or BER.</p>
<p>PARylation is a reversible post-translational modification. In this study, we showed that timely and efficient dePARylation is critical for cell survival. Thus, both PARylation and dePARylation play important functions in the cell. Particularly, dePARylation appears to be indispensable, since it is required for cell survival. The successful clinical application of PARylation inhibition, such as PARPis for the treatment of BRCA-deficient cancers, raises the possibility of targeting dePARylation as an alternative strategy, especially for the treatment of PARPi-resistant tumors. Given that PARG accounts for more than 90% of dePARylation activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>, selective PARG inhibitors are being developed as potential anti-cancer agents. Although defective HR and DDR have been shown to be synthetic lethal with PARG inhibition, comprehensive investigations of cellular response to PARG inhibition have not yet been conducted. In this study, we showed that unexpectedly, PARG is the top synthetic lethality gene in the CRISPR screening with our homemade DDR sgRNA library, which we further validated in HEK293A and HeLa PARG KO cells (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref></bold> and <bold>S1D</bold>). Our PARG KO cells plus PARGi mimic complete loss of PARG activity (<bold>Fig. S9</bold>), which provides is an unique opportunity to study the major function of PARG in proliferating cells. These data were further confirmed with the use of PARG cKO cells we generated (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref></bold>).</p>
<p>PARP1 plays important roles during normal S phase, especially at DNA replication forks and two-ended DSBs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup>. More recently, unligated Okazaki fragments were identified as the source of SSBs that activate PARP1 in normal proliferating cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>. Moreover, unligated Okazaiki fragments, on which PARP1 may be trapped, can be converted into structures that result in synthetic lethality in HR-defective cancer cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref></sup>. PARG is also enriched at DNA replication forks through pADPr- and PCNA-dependent mechanisms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref></sup>. In addition, PARG may protect DNA replication forks during normal and damage-treated S-phase<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref></sup>. Interestingly, the identification of unligated Okazaki fragments as the source of endougenous pADPr in normal proliferating cells was only noticeable under short-term PARG inhibition. Treatment with another recently developed PARG inhibitor COH34, also led to increased PARylation at replication sites in S phase cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>. These previous reports agree with the data presented in this study. Indeed, we showed robust and specific PARP1/2-dependent S phase pADPr in PARG KO cells treated with PARGi (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref></bold> and <bold>S3</bold>). We further confirmed that the S phase-specific pADPr requires normal S phase progression and the generation of Okazaki fragments (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B-C</xref></bold> and <bold>S3B</bold>). Moreover, the cytotoxicity of PARGi requires S phase progression (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D-E</xref></bold>). In addition, PARG KO cells displayed more chromatin-bound PARP1 and PARylated PARP1 (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref></bold> and <bold>S4A</bold>). Enhanced pADPr levels were observed in the chromatin fraction of PARG KO cells under PARGi treatment (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref></bold>). One possible explanation is that in PARG KO cells treated with PARGi, chromatin-bound or trapped PARP1 may not be removed appropriately or efficiently, which further prevents Okazaki fragment ligation/maturation that eventually results in cell lethality. However, the underlying mechanism of more chromatin-bound PARP1 and PARylated PARP1 in PARG KO cells still needs further elucidation.</p>
<p>The inability to remove S phase-specific pADPr eventually led to pADPr throughout cell cycle and γH2AX signaling (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C-D</xref></bold> and <bold>S4D-F</bold>), indicating that it is essential to resolve S phase-specific pADPr to maintain cell viability. In agreement with the literature<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>, we observed S phase-specific pADPr in HeLa cells following PARGi treatment, although such S phase-specific pADPr was not detected in HEK293A cells following PARGi treatment. The lower level of PARG expression may be the reason for this difference between HEK293A and HeLa cells (<bold>Fig. S4E</bold>). However, significant amounts of PARG activity still existed in HeLa cells, since these cells did not show noticeable PARGi sensitivity unless we knockout or knockdown PARG.</p>
<p>Cell viability–based genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 screening unbiasedly uncovers sensitivity and resistance genes under certain conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>, while FACS-based CRISPR/Cas9 screening using reporter cell lines or antibodies recognizing specific signaling molecules can reveal key regulators of signaling pathways<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>. In this study, we performed both types of screens, which revealed key pADPr regulators, including BER pathway proteins (POLB, XRCC1, LIG3, and CHD1L), DNA replication/Okazaki fragment maturation proteins (RFCs, FEN1, and LIG1), and ARH3 (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref></bold> and <bold>S5A</bold>). In addition, consistent with our hypothesis that pADPr accumulation leads to cell death, we showed that loss of genes involved in Okazaki fragment maturation or BER resulted in PARGi sensitivity (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C-G</xref></bold>). All of these results further validated our working model that S phase-specific pADPr likely originated from unligated Okazaki fragments, which if not removed would eventually lead to DNA damage and cell death.</p>
<p>During DNA replication, Okazaki fragments are normally ligated by LIG1. However, some unligated Okazaki fragments may activate PARP1 and recruit XRCC1/LIG3<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>, which agrees with the results of early studies indicating that both LIG1 and LIG3 are required for Okazaki fragment maturation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup>. Indeed, we showed that LIG1 depletion, which would result in more DNA nicks in S phase cells, led to the enhancement of S phase PARylation (<bold>Fig. S5E</bold>). As for LIG3, it can substitute LIG1 function for the ligation of Okazaki fragments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref></sup>. However, it also has a critical and essential function in mitochondria but is separated for its role in XRCC1-dependent SSBR<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref></sup>. We observed minor S phase pADPr due to LIG3 knockdown with PARGi treatment (<bold>Fig. S5E</bold>), which is likely due to insufficient KD of LIG3 in these experiments. Unlike LIG1 KO and LIG3 KD cells, XRCC1 KO and POLB KO cells increase PARylation in a cell cycle–independent manner (<bold>Fig. S5E</bold>), which agrees with the finding that POLB and XRCC1 are required for BER/SSB repair, but not specifically for Okazaki fragment ligation/maturation. Our results suggest that PARylation and dePARylation are mainly involved in two cellular processes, i.e. Okazaki fragment maturation and BER/SSB repair, since both processes have nicked DNA as intermediates, which are likely the physiological substrates that recruit and activate PARP1/2.</p>
<p>Interestingly, two well-known PARylation regulators, ARH3 and HPF1, showed synthetic lethality with PARGi in PARG KO cells (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref></bold>). Given that ARH3 and PARG are the primary dePARylation enzymes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>, it should be predictable that ARH3 was listed as the top hit with PARGi in PARG KO cells in both pADPr signal screen and synthetic lethality screen (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref></bold> and <bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">C</xref></bold>). As for HPF1, a previous report showed that the loss of HPF1 will release the activity of PARP1 to PARylation in acidic resides<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref></sup>; moreover, a recent study shows that HPF1 and nucleosomes mediate a dramatic switch in the activity of PARP1 from polymerase to hydrolase<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref></sup>. More important, HPF1 promotes the ligation of the Okazaki fragment by LIG3-XRCC1 as a backup pathway<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref></sup>, while the unligated Okazaki fragments were the source of the S phase pADPr signal in this study.</p>
<p>More importantly, our data indicate that PARG expression is a potential biomarker for PARGi sensitivity. We used the available database and cell lines to validate that cells with low PARG expression are sensitive to PARGi. In addition, we examined PARG expression by the IHC assay in commercial TMA samples and uncovered a fraction of breast and ovarian cancers with no detectable or low PARG expression (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref></bold>). We also examined the sensitivity of HR-deficient cells to PARGi. Although HR deficiency sensitizes cells to PARGi, our results indicate that PARG loss or low expression is still the main driver of PARGi sensitivity in these cells (<bold>Fig. S6,7</bold>).</p>
<p>Mechanically, we showed that the dePARylation activity of PARG is indispensable for cell survival (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref></bold> and <bold>S9</bold>). The residual PARG dePARylation activity observed in PARG KO cells likely supports cell growth, which can be further inhibited by PARGi (<bold>Fig. S9</bold>). Although a dose-dependent inhibition of PARG activity by PARGi was also noted in wild-type cells, significant fraction of PARG activity remained even in the presence of highest concentration of PARGi used in this study, which is consistent with our results that HEK293A cells are insensitive to PARGi. More importantly, these data further indicate that PARG expression/activity is a potential biomarker for PARGi sensitivity.</p>
<p>Taken together, the dramatic S phase-specific pADPr signaling detected under our experimental conditions provides us a rare opportunity to gain a better understanding of PARG function and pADPr signaling in normal proliferating cells without any exogenous DNA damage. In addition, our systematic CRISPR/Cas9 screens uncover key regulators of pADPr signaling that also contribute to PARGi sensitivity. Moreover, our finding that PARG expression may a potential biomarker of PARGi sensitivity will allow the further development of these inhibitors for the treatment of tumors with PARG loss and therefore offer a new targeted strategy for cancer therapy.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this manuscript Nie et al investigate the effect of PARG KO and PARG inhibition (PARGi) on pADPR, DNA damage, cell viability and synthetic lethal interactions in HEK293A and Hela cells. Surprisingly, the authors report that PARG KO cells are sensitive to PARGi and show higher pADPR levels than PARG KO cells, which is abrogated upon deletion or inhibition of PARP1/PARP2. The authors explain the sensitivity of PARG KO to PARGi through incomplete PARG depletion and demonstrate complete loss of PARG activity when incomplete PARG KO cells are transfected with additional gRNAs in the presence of PARPi. Furthermore, the authors show that the sensitivity of PARG KO cells to PARGi is not caused by NAD depletion but by S-phase accumulation of pADPR on chromatin coming from unligated Okazaki fragments, which are recognized and bound by PARP1. Consistently, PARG KO or PARG inhibition show synthetic lethality with Pol beta, which is required for Okazaki fragment maturation. PARG expression levels in ovarian cancer cell lines correlate negatively with their sensitivity to PARGi.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors show that PARG is essential for removing ADP-ribosylation in S-phase.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>1. This begs the question as to the relevant substrates of PARG in S-phase, which could be addressed, for example, by analysing PARylated proteins associated with replication forks in PARG-depleted cells (EdU pulldown and Af1521 enrichment followed by mass spectrometry).</p>
<p>2. The results showing the generation of a full PARG KO should be moved to the beginning of the Results section, right after the first Results chapter (PARG depletion leads to drastic sensitivity to PARGi), otherwise the reader is left to wonder how PARG KO cells can be sensitive to PARGi when there should be presumably no PARG present.</p>
<p>3. Please indicate in the first figure which isoforms were targeted with gRNAs, given that there are 5 PARG isoforms. You should also highlight that the PARG antibody only recognizes the largest isoform, which is clearly absent in your PARG KO, but other isoforms may still be produced, depending on where the cleavage sites were located.</p>
<p>4. FACS data need to be quantified. Scatter plots can be moved to Supplementary while quantification histograms with statistical analysis should be placed in the main figures.</p>
<p>5. All colony formation assays should be quantified and sensitivity plots should be shown next to example plates.</p>
<p>6. Please indicate how many times each experiment was performed independently and include statistical analysis.</p>

<p>In the revised version the authors have addressed some of the reviewers' concerns, but, despite the new explanatory paragraph on page 16, the paper remains confusing because as shown in Figure 7 at the end of the Results the PARG KO 293A cells that were analyzed at the beginning of the Results are not true PARG knockouts. The authors stated that they did not rewrite the Results because they wanted to describe the experiments in the order in which they were carried out, but there is no imperative for the experiments to be described in the order in which they were done, and it would be much easier for the uninitiated reader to appreciate the significance of these studies if the true PARG KO cell data were presented at the beginning, as all three of the original reviewers proposed.</p>
<p>While the authors have to some extent clarified the nature of the PARG KO alleles, they have not been able to identify the source of the residual PARG activity in the PARG KO cells, in part because different commercial PARG antibodies give different and conflicting immunoblotting results. Additional sequence characterization of PARG mRNAs expressed in the PARG cKO cells, and also in-depth proteomic analysis of the different PARG bands could provide further insight into the origins and molecular identities of the various PARG proteins expressed from the different KO PARG alleles, and determine which of them might retain catalytic activity.</p>
<p>The authors have made no progress in identifying which are the key PARG substrates required for S phase progression, although they suggest that PARP1 itself may be an important target.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>eLife assessment</bold></p>
<p>The authors' finding that PARG hydrolase removal of polyADP-ribose (PAR) protein adducts generated in response to the presence of unligated Okazaki fragments is important for S-phase progression is potentially valuable, but the evidence is incomplete, and identification of relevant PARylated PARG substrates in S-phase is needed to understand the role of PARylation and dePARylation in S-phase progression. Their observation that human ovarian cancer cells with low levels of PARG are more sensitive to a PARG inhibitor, presumably due to the accumulation of high levels of protein PARylation, suggests that low PARG protein levels could serve as a criterion to select ovarian cancer patients for treatment with a PARG inhibitor drug.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for the assessment and summary. Please see below for details as we have now addressed the deficiencies pointed out by the reviewers.</p>
<p>We believe that PARP1 is one of the major relevant PARG substrates in S phase cells. Previous studies reported that PARP1 recognizes unligated Okazaki fragments and induces S phase PARylation, which recruits single-strand break repair proteins such as XRCC1 and LIG3 that acts as a backup pathway for Okazaki fragment maturation (Hanzlikova et al., 2018; Kumamoto et al., 2021). In this study, we revealed that accumulation of PARP1/2-dependent S phase PARylation eventually led to cell death (Fig. 2). Furthermore, we found that chromatin-bound PARP1 as well as PARylated PARP1 increased in PARG KO cells (Fig. S4A and Fig. 4A), suggesting that PARP1 is one of the key substrates of PARG in S phase cells. Of course, PARG may have additional substrates besides PARP1 which are required for its roles in S phase progression, as PARG is known to be recruited to DNA damage sites through pADPr- and PCNA-dependent mechanisms (Mortusewicz et al., 2011). Precisely how PARG regulates S phase progression warrants further investigation.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>I have a major conceptual problem with this manuscript: How can the full deletion of a gene (PARG) sensitize a cell to further inhibition by its chemical inhibitor (PARGi) since the target protein is fully absent?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Please see below for details about this point. Briefly, we found that PARG is an essential gene (Fig. 7). There was residual PARG activity in our PARG KO cells, although the loss of full-length PARG was confirmed by Western blotting and DNA sequencing (Fig. S9). The residual PARG activity in these cells can be further inhibited by PARG inhibitor, which eventually lead to cell death.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The authors state in the discussion section: &quot;The residual PARG dePARylation activity observed in PARG KO cells likely supports cell growth, which can be further inhibited by PARGi&quot;. What does this statement mean? Is the authors' conclusion that their PARG KOs are not true KOs but partial hypomorphic knockdowns? Were the authors working with KO clones or CRISPR deletion in populations of cells?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The reviewer is correct that our PARG KOs are not true KOs. We were working with CRISPR edited KO clones. As shown in this manuscript, we validated our KO clones by Western blotting, DNA sequencing and MMS-induced PARylation. Despite these efforts and our inability to detect full-length PARG in our KO clones, we suspect that our PARG KO cells may still express one or more active fragments of PARG due to alternative splicing and/or alternative ATG usage.</p>
<p>As shown in Fig. 7, we believe that PARG is essential for proliferation. Our initial KO cell lines are not complete PARG KO cells and residual PARG activity in these cells could support cell proliferation. Unfortunately, due to lack of appropriate reagents we could not draw solid conclusions regarding the isoforms or the truncated PARG expressed in these cells (Please see Western blots below).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Are there splice variants of PARG that were not knocked down? Are there PARP paralogues that can complement the biochemical activity of PARG in the PARG KOs? The authors do not discuss these critical issues nor engage with this problem.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>There are five reviewed or potential PARG isoforms identified in the Uniprot database. The two sgRNAs (#1 and #2) used to generate initial PARG KO cells in this manuscript target all three catalytically active isoforms (isoforms 1, 2 and 3), and sgRNA#2 used in HeLa cells also targets isoforms 4 and 5, but these isoforms are considered catalytically inactive according to the Uniprot database. However, it is likely that sgRNA-mediated genome editing may lead to the creation of new alternatively spliced PARG mRNAs or the use of alternative ATG, which can produce catalytically active forms of PARG. Instead of searching for these putative spliced PARG RNAs, we used two independent antibodies that recognize the C-terminus of PARG for WB as shown below. Unfortunately, besides full-length PARG, these antibodies also recognized several other bands, some of them were reduced or absent in PARG KO cells, others were not. Thus, we could not draw a clear conclusion which functional isoform was expressed in our PARG KO cells. Nevertheless, we directly measured PARG activity in PARG KO cells (Fig. S9) and showed that we were still able to detect residual PARG activity in these PARG KO cells. These data clearly indicate that residual PARG activity are present and detected in our KO cells, but the precise nature of these truncated forms of PARG remains elusive.</p>

<p>Thank you for your nice comments. The complete loss of PARG activity was observed in PARG complete/conditional KO (cKO) cells. These cKO clones were generated using wild-type cells transfected with sgRNAs targeting the catalytic domain of PARG in the presence of PARP inhibitor.</p>

<p>Thank you for your suggestion! However, we would like to keep the complete PARG KO result at the end of the Results section, since this was how this project evolved. Initially, we did not know that PARG is an essential gene. Thus, we speculated that PARGi may target not only PARG but also a second target, which only becomes essential in the absence of PARG. To test this possibility, we performed FACS-based and cell survival-based whole-genome CRISPR screens (Fig. 5). However, this putative second target was not revealed by our CRISPR screening data (Fig. 5). We then tested the possibility that these cells may have residual PARG expression or activity and only cells with very low PARG expression are sensitive to PARGi, which turned out to be the case for ovarian cancer cells. Equipped with PARP inhibitor and sgRNAs targeting the catalytic domain of PARG, we finally generated cells with complete loss of PARG activity to prove that PARG is an essential gene (Fig. 7). This series of experiments underscore the challenge of validating any KO cell lines, i.e. the identification of frame-shift mutations, absence of full-length proteins, and phenotypic changes may still not be sufficient to validate KO clones. This is an important lesson we learned and we would like to share it with the scientific community.</p>
<p>To avoid further misunderstanding, we will include additional statements/comments at the end of “PARG depletion leads to drastic sensitivity to PARGi” section and at the beginning of “CRISPR screens reveal genes responsible for regulating pADPr signaling and/or cell lethality in WT and PARG KO cells”. Hope that our revised manuscript will make it clear.</p>

<p>The two sgRNAs (#1 and #2) used to generate initial PARG KO cells in this manuscript target all three catalytically active isoforms (isoforms 1, 2 and 3), and sgRNA#2 used in HeLa cells also targets isoforms 4 and 5, but these isoforms are considered catalytically inactive according to the Uniprot database. As suggested, we will modify Fig. S1D and the figure legends.</p>
<p>The manufacturer instruction states that the Anti-PARG antibody (66564S) can only recognize isoform 1, this antibody could recognize isoforms 2 and 3 albeit weakly based on Western blot results with lysates prepared from PARG cKO cells reconstituted with different PARG isoforms, as shown below. As suggested, we will add a statement in the revised manuscript and provide the Western blotting data below.</p>

<p>To test whether other isoforms were expressed in 293A and/or HeLa cells, we used two independent antibodies that recognize the C-terminus of PARG for WB as shown below. Unfortunately, besides full-length PARG, these antibodies also recognized several other bands, some of them were reduced or absent in PARG KO cells, others were not. Thus, we could not draw a clear conclusion which functional isoforms or truncated forms were expressed in our PARG KO cells.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with this reviewer that quantification of FACS data may provide straightforward results in some of our data. However, it is challenging to quantify positive S phase pADPr signaling in some panels, for example in Fig. 3A and Fig. 4C. In both panels, pADPr signaling was detected throughout the cell cycle and therefore it is difficult to know the percentage of S phase pADPr signaling in these samples. Thus, we decide to keep the scatter plots to demonstrate the dramatic and S phase-specific pADPr signaling in PARG KO cells treated with PARGi. We hope that these data are clear and convincing even without any quantification.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Here the authors carried out a CRISPR/sgRNA screen with a DDR gene-targeted mini-library in HEK293A cells looking for genes whose loss increased sensitivity to treatment with the PARG inhibitor, PDD00017273 (PARGi). Surprisingly they found that PARG itself, which encodes the cellular poly(ADP-ribose) glycohydrolase (dePARylation) enzyme, was a major hit. Targeted PARG KO in 293A and HeLa cells also caused high sensitivity to PARGi. When PARG KO cells were reconstituted with catalytically-dead PARG, MMS treatment caused an increase in PARylation, not observed when cells were reconstituted with WT PARG or when the PARG KO was combined with PARP1/2 DKO, suggesting that loss of PARG leads to a strong PARP1/2-dependent increase in protein PARylation. The decrease in intracellular NADH+, the substrate for PARP-driven PARylation, observed in PARG KO cells was reversed by treatment with NMN or NAM, and this treatment partially rescued the PARG KO cell lethality. However, since NAD+ depletion with the FK868 nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT) inhibitor did not induce a similar lethality the authors concluded that NAD+ depletion/reduction was only partially responsible for the PARGi toxicity. Interestingly, PARylation was also observed in untreated PARG KO cells, specifically in S phase, without a significant rise in γH2AX signals. Using cells synchronized at G1/S by double thymidine blockade and release, they showed that entry into S phase was necessary for PARGi to induce PARylation in PARG KO cells. They found an increased association of PARP1 with a chromatin fraction in PARG KO cells independent of PARGi treatment, and suggested that PARP1 trapping on chromatin might account in part for the increased PARGi sensitivity. They also showed that prolonged PARGi treatment of PARG KO cells caused S phase accumulation of pADPr eventually leading to DNA damage, as evidenced by increased anti-γH2AX antibody signals and alkaline comet assays. Based on the use of emetine, they deduced that this response could be caused by unligated Okazaki fragments. Next, they carried out FACS-based CRISPR screens to identify genes that might be involved in cell lethality in WT and PARG KO cells, finding that loss of base excision repair (BER) and DNA repair genes led to increased PARylation and PARGi sensitivity, whereas loss of PARP1 had the opposite effects. They also found that BER pathway disruption exhibited synthetic lethality with PARGi treatment in both PARG KO cells and WT cells, and that loss of genes involved in Okazaki fragment ligation induced S phase pADPr signaling. In a panel of human ovarian cancer cell lines, PARGi sensitivity was found to correlate with low levels of PARG mRNA, and they showed that the PARGi sensitivity of cells could be reduced by PARPi treatment. Finally, they addressed the conundrum of why PARG KO cells should be sensitive to a specific PARG inhibitor if there is no PARG to inhibit and found that the PARG KO cells had significant residual PARG activity when measured in a lysate activity assay, which could be inhibited by PARGi, although the inhabited PARG activity levels remained higher than those of PARG cKO cells (see below). This led them to generate new, more complete PARG KO cells they called complete/conditional KO (cKO), whose survival required the inclusion of the olaparib PARPi in the growth medium. These PARG cKO cells exhibited extremely low levels of PARG activity in vitro, consistent with a true PARG KO phenotype.</p>

<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The finding that human ovarian cancer cells with low levels of PARG are more sensitive to inhibition with a small molecule PARG inhibitor, presumably due to the accumulation of high levels of protein PARylation (pADPr) that are toxic to cells is quite interesting, and this could be useful in the future as a diagnostic marker for preselection of ovarian cancer patients for treatment with a PARG inhibitor drug. The finding that loss of base excision repair (BER) and DNA repair genes led to increased PARylation and PARGi sensitivity is in keeping with the conclusion that PARG activity is essential for cell fitness, because it prevents excessive protein PARylation. The observation that increased PARylation can be detected in an unperturbed S phase in PARG KO cells is also of interest. However, the functional importance of protein PARylation at the replication fork in the normal cell cycle was not fully investigated, and none of the key PARylation targets for PARG required for S phase progression were identified. Overall, there are some interesting findings in the paper, but their impact is significantly lessened by the confusing way in which the paper has been organized and written, and this needs to be rectified.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We believe that PARP1 is one of the major relevant PARG substrates in S phase cells. Previous studies reported that PARP1 recognizes unligated Okazaki fragments and induces S phase PARylation, which recruits single-strand break repair proteins such as XRCC1 and LIG3 that acts as a backup pathway for Okazaki fragment maturation (Hanzlikova et al., 2018; Kumamoto et al., 2021). In this study, we revealed that accumulation of PARP1/2-dependent S phase PARylation eventually led to cell death (Fig. 2). Furthermore, we found that chromatin-bound PARP1 as well as PARylated PARP1 increased in PARG KO cells (Fig. S4A and Fig. 4A), suggesting that PARP1 is one of the key substrates of PARG in S phase cells. Of course, PARG may have additional substrates besides PARP1 which are required for its roles in S phase progression, as PARG is known to be recruited to DNA damage sites through pADPr- and PCNA-dependent mechanisms (Mortusewicz et al., 2011). Precisely how PARG regulates S phase progression warrants further investigation.</p>
<p>As suggested, we will revise our manuscript accordingly and provide additional explanation/statement upfront to avoid any misunderstandings.</p>

<p>1. Figure 1c. Why does the viability of PARG KO cells improve at higher doses of PARGi? How do the authors explain this paradox?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This phenomenon was observed in 293A PARG KO cells and happened in CellTiter-Glo assay, especially with the top three PARGi concentrations (100 µM, 33.33 µM and 11.11 µM). This may due to the low solubility of this PARGi in the medium, since we sometimes observed precipitation at high concentrations when PARGi stock was diluted in medium.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. Figure 2d. The authors show that PARGi reduced NAD+ level by 20%. This reduction in NAD+ probably does not explain the cell death phenotype observed by parthanatos cell death. What pathway is activated by PARGi to induce cell death?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Since PARG KO cells treated with PARGi led to uncontrolled pADPr accumulation, it is possible that some of these cells may die due to parthanotos. However, we did not observe a dramatic reduction in NAD+ level. A previous study showed that Parg(-/-) mouse ES cells predominantly underwent caspase-dependent apoptosis (Shirai et al., 2013). Indeed, PARP1 cleavage was detected in PARG KO cells with prolonged PARGi treatment, indicating that at least some of these cells die due to apoptosis (Fig. 2A). Cytotoxicity of PARGi in PARG KO cells may due to several mechanisms including apoptosis, parthanatos and NAD+ reduction.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>1. The major problem with this paper is conceptual - namely, how could PARG knockout cells be hypersensitive to a selective PARG small molecular inhibitor. The evidence in Figure 7 that there is measurable residual PARG activity in the so-called PARG KO 293A and HeLa cells provides a partial explanation for why PARG inhibitor treatment might be deleterious to the PARG KO cells, i.e., because PARGi blocks this residual PARG activity. However, although the authors characterized the PARG alleles in the 293A PARG KO cells by sequencing, the molecular origin of the significant level of residual PARG activity remains unclear (see points 7-9).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Yes, in our study we showed that PARGi treatment inhibited the residual PARG activity in PARG KO cells, which mimics complete loss of PARG as PARG is an essential gene. These data agree with a previous study using Parg(-/-) mouse cells (Koh et al., 2004).We attempted to define the molecular origin of the residual PARG activity, unfortunately this was challenging (please see below for additional discussions). Nevertheless, we showed that residual PARG activity could be detected in PARG KO cells and more importantly cells with reduced PARG expression or activity are sensitive to PARGi. These results indicate that PARG expression and/or activity may be used as a biomarker for PARGi-based therapy.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. Although the most obvious explanation for the PARGi sensitivity data presented in Figures 1-4 is that the PARG KO cells have residual PARG activity, the authors wait until the discussion on page 26 to raise the possibility that the PARG KO cells might have residual PARG activity that renders them sensitive to PARGi. It would be more logical to move the PARG activity data in Figure 7 earlier in the paper as a supplementary figure, so that the reader is not left wondering how a PARG KO cell remains sensitive to a PARG inhibitor. For this reason, it is recommended that the whole paper be reorganized and rewritten to provide a more logical flow that allows the reader to understand what was done, and why it is hard to generate complete PARG KO cells because the accumulation of pADPR adducts is toxic to the cell.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your suggestion! However, we would like to keep the complete PARG KO result at the end of the Results section, since this was how this project evolved. Initially, we did not know that PARG is an essential gene. Thus, we speculated that PARGi may target not only PARG but also a second target, which only becomes essential in the absence of PARG. To test this possibility, we performed FACS-based and cell survival-based whole-genome CRISPR screens (Fig. 5). However, this putative second target was not revealed by our CRISPR screening data (Fig. 5). We then tested the possibility that these cells may have residual PARG expression or activity and only cells with very low PARG expression are sensitive to PARGi, which turned out to be the case for ovarian cancer cells. Equipped with PARP inhibitor and sgRNAs targeting the catalytic domain of PARG, we finally generated cells with complete loss of PARG activity to prove that PARG is an essential gene (Fig. 7). This series of experiments underscore the challenge of validating any KO cell lines, i.e. the identification of frame-shift mutations, absence of full-length proteins, and phenotypic changes may still not be sufficient to validate KO clones. This is an important lesson we learned and we would like to share it with the scientific community.</p>
<p>To avoid further misunderstanding, we will include additional statements/comments at the end of “PARG depletion leads to drastic sensitivity to PARGi” section and at the beginning of “CRISPR screens reveal genes responsible for regulating pADPr signaling and/or cell lethality in WT and PARG KO cells”. Hope that our revised manuscript will make it clear.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. Exactly how PARG activity would be coordinated with PARP1/2 activity during normal S phase to ensure that PARylation can serve its required function, whatever that may be, and is then removed by PARG is unclear - how would this be orchestrated at the level of a replication fork?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>PARG is known to be recruited to sites of DNA damage through pADPr- and PCNA-dependent mechanisms (Mortusewicz et al., 2011). Our current hypothesis is that PARP1 is one of the major PARG substrates in S phase cells. Previous studies reported that PARP1 recognizes unligated Okazaki fragments and induces S phase PARylation, which recruits single-strand break repair proteins such as XRCC1 and LIG3 that acts as a backup pathway for Okazaki fragment maturation (Hanzlikova et al., 2018; Kumamoto et al., 2021). In this study, we revealed that accumulation of PARP1/2-dependent S phase PARylation eventually led to cell death (Fig. 2). Furthermore, we found that chromatin-bound PARP1 as well as PARylated PARP1 increased in PARG KO cells (Fig. S4A and Fig. 4A), suggesting that PARP1 is one of the key substrates of PARG in S phase cells. Of course, PARG may have additional substrates besides PARP1 which are required for its roles in S phase progression. Precisely how PARG regulates S phase progression warrants further investigation.</p>

<p>1. Figure 2B: What gRNAs were used to generate the 293A and HeLa PARG knock clones, i.e., where are they located in the PARG gene? If they are not in the catalytic domain it might be possible to generate PARG proteins with N-terminal deletions that are still active (see points 8-10 below).</p>

<p>The two sgRNAs (#1 and #2) used to generate initial PARG KO cells in this manuscript target all three catalytically active isoforms (isoforms 1, 2 and 3), and sgRNA#2 used in HeLa cells also targets isoforms 4 and 5, but these isoforms are considered catalytically inactive according to the Uniprot database. As suggested, we will modify Fig. S1D and the figure legends to show the localization of gRNAs.</p>
<p>We agree with this reviewer that truncated but active forms of PARG exist in these KO cells. We attempted to identify these trunated forms of PARG by using two independent antibodies that recognize the C-terminus of PARG for WB as shown below. Unfortunately, besides full-length PARG, these antibodies also recognized several other bands, some of them were reduced or absent in PARG KO cells, others were not. Thus, we could not draw a clear conclusion which functional isoform/truncated form was expressed in our PARG KO cells. Nevertheless, we directly measured PARG activity in PARG KO cells (Fig. S9) and showed that we were still able to detect residual PARG activity in these PARG KO cells. Based on these results, we stated that the residual PARG activity was detected in our KO cells, but we were not able to specify the truncated variants of PARG in these cells.</p>

<p>1. Figure 3B/page 19: The authors state that &quot;emetine, which diminishes Okazaki fragments, greatly inhibited S phase pADPr signaling in PARG KO cells&quot;, and from this deduced that Okazaki fragments on the lagging strand activate PARylation. However, emetine is not a specific lagging strand synthesis inhibitor, as implied here, but rather a protein synthesis inhibitor, which inhibits Okazaki fragment formation indirectly (see PMID: 36260751). The authors need to rewrite this section to explain how emetine works in this context.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As suggested, we will cite this reference and discuss how emetine inhibits Okazaki fragment maturation in our revised manuscript. Additionally, we used three different POLA1 inhibitors to diminish Okazaki fragments. As shown in Fig. S3B, all three POLA1 inhibitors significantly abolished S-phase pADPr induced by PARGi in PARG KO cells. Furthermore, POLA1 inhibitors, adarotene and CD437, were able to rescue cell lethality caused by PARGi in PARG KO cells (Fig. 3E).</p>

<p>1. Figure 7: It is not clear why these cells are called PARG complete/conditional KO cells (cKO). Generally, &quot;conditional knockout&quot; refers to a cell or animal in which a gene can be conditionally knocked out by inducible expression of Cre. Here, it appears that &quot;conditional&quot; refers to the fact that the PARG KO cells only grow in the presence of olaparib - is this the case?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Yes, we used the name to separate these cells from our initial PARG KO cells. Moreover, we were only able to obtain and maintain these PARG cKO clones with complete loss of PARG activity in the presence of PARP inhibitor. Therefore, we called them PARG complete/conditional KO (cKO) cells.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. Figure 7B and D: The level of full-length PARG protein was much lower in the 293A and HeLa cKO cells compared to WT cells consistent with cKO cells representing a more complete PARG KO. The level of PARG protein in the 293A PARG cKO cells was apparently also lower than in the original PARG KO cells, but the KO and cKO samples should be run side by side to demonstrate this conclusively, and the bands need to be quantified. In panel B, it is not clear from the legend what cKO_3 and cKO_4 are, but presumably, they are different clones, and this should be stated.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Full-length PARG was not detected in either PARG KO or PARG cKO cells by WB. The apparent lower level of endogenous PARG in Fig. 7D was due to the fact that reconstituted cells had high exogenous PARG expression and therefore we had to reduce exposure time for WB.</p>
<p>As for cKO_3 and cKO_4 in Fig.7, they are different clones created by different sgRNAs. As suggested, we will include additional information in figure legends to clearly state which sgRNA was used to generate the respective KO and cKO clones.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. Figure S8: There is not enough information here or in the text to allow the reader to interpret these PARG allele sequences obtained from the PARG KO cells. From the Methods section, it appears that the PARG KO cells were clonal, with sequence data from one clone of each of the 293A and HeLa cell PARG KO cells being shown. If this is right, then in both cell types one out of four PARG alleles is wild type, and therefore one would expect the PARG protein signal to be ~25% of that in WT cells. However, based on the 293A PARG KO cells PARG immunoblot in Figure 2B the PARG protein signal is clearly much lower than 25% (these bands need to be quantified), and this discrepancy needs to be explained. What is the level of PARG protein in the PARG KO HeLa cells? If different PARG KO cell clones are analyzed by sequencing, do they all have an apparently intact PARG allele? Four different gRNA target sites in the PARG gene are shown in panel A in Figure 7, but the description in the text regarding how the four gRNAs were used is totally inadequate - were all four used simultaneously or only the two in the catalytic domain? Were pairs of gRNAs used in an attempt to generate a large intervening deletion - some Southern blots of the PARG gene region in the PARG cKO cells are needed to figure this out. The gRNAs are given numbers in Figure 7A, but it is unclear from the sequences shown in Figures S8 and S9 which gRNA sites are shown. All of this has to be clarified, so that the reader can understand the nature of the KO/cKO cells knockout alleles, and what PARG-related products, if any, they can express.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Yes, all KO and cKO cells used in this study are single clones. As suggested, we will revise figure legends in Fig.7, S8 and S9 to include detailed information. To avoid any further misunderstanding, we will label the allele “WT” to “WT (reference)” in Fig. S8 and S9. We did not detect intact/wild-type PARG sequence in any single KO/cKO clone by DNA sequencing. Sequencing of single KO/cKO clones was performed by using TOP TA Cloning kit. Briefly, genomic DNA was extracted from each single KO/cKO clone. Approximately 300bp surrounding the sgRNA targeting sequence was amplified by PCR. The PCR product was cloned into the vector and approximately 10-15 bacteria clones were extracted and sent for sequencing. If any intact/wild-type PARG sequence was detected in these 10-15 bacteria clones, this KO/cKO clone was considered heterozygous clone and discarded.</p>
<p>HEK293A and HeLa cells are not diploid cells and have complex karyotypes. PARG gene is located on chromosome 10. Karyotyping by M-FISH shows that HeLa cells have 3 copies of chromosome 10 (Landry et al., 2013). HEK293 cells predominantly have 3 copies of chromosome 10 and sometimes 4 copies can be detected by G-banding (Binz et al., 2019). Therefore, it is anticipated that 1 to 4 mutant alleles would be detected in each KO/cKO clone by sequencing.</p>
<p>Only one sgRNA was transfected into cells for the selection of single clones. We did not use paired or multiple sgRNAs in any of these experiments. As shown in Fig. S1D and Fig. 7A, HEK293A derived and HeLa derived PARG KO single clones were generated with the use of different sgRNAs. In addition, the two PARG cKO single clones from HEK293A and HeLa cells were also generated by the use of two different sgRNAs, as shown in Fig. 7A-B. We will include all the information above in the revised manuscript, i.e. in Methods section as well as in figure legends.</p>

<p>1. Figure S9A: The sequences of the 293A PARG alleles in the cKO cells suggest that these cells also have one intact PARG allele, which again does not fit with the very low level of intact PARG protein shown in Figure 7B. How do the authors explain this?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Sorry, this is a misunderstanding. The allele “WT” in Fig. S8 and S9 is the reference sequence. We will change it to “Reference sequence” to avoid further confusion. As mentioned above, we did not detect any intact/wild-type PARG sequence in any of our single KO/cKO clones by sequencing.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. Figure S9B: These critical lysate activity data show that the PARG KO cells have ~50% of the PARG activity detected in WT cells. However, this is not consistent with the PARG protein level detected in PARG immunoblot in Figure 1B, which appears to be less than 5% of the PARG protein level in WT cells (with one intact PARG allele in these cells one would theoretically expect~ 25%, although this depends on whether all four alleles are expressed equally). One possibility is that active PARG fragments are generated from one or more of the PARG KO alleles in the PARG KO cells. Targeted sequencing of PARG mRNAs might reveal whether there are shorter RNAs that could encode a protein containing the C-terminal catalytic domain (aa 570-910). In addition, the authors need to show the entire immunoblot to determine if there are smaller proteins recognized by the anti-PARG antibodies that might represent shorter PARG gene products (for this we need to know where the epitope against which the PARG antibodies are directed are located within the PARG protein - ideally they authors need to use an antibody directed against an epitope near the C-terminus).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As stated in the Methods section, we incubated cell lysates with substrates overnight to evaluate the maximum level of pADPr hydrolysis, i.e. PARG activity, we were able to detect in this assay. It is very likely that the PARG activity in PARG KO cells was much lower than 50%, due to saturation of signals for lysates isolated from wild-type cells. Thus, the data presented in our manuscript probably underestimate the reduction of PARG activity in PARG KO cells. Nevertheless, these data indicate that residual PARG activity was detected in PARG KO cells, however this activity was absent in PARG cKO cells.</p>
<p>As aforementioned, we used two independent antibodies that recognize the C-terminus of PARG for WB. Unfortunately, we could not draw a clear conclusion which functional isoforms or truncated proteins were expressed in our PARG KO cells. The dePARylation assay used here may be the best way to test the residual PARG activity in our KO and cKO cells.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. Figure 7D: In this experiment, the level of re-expressed WT PARG protein was much higher than that of the endogenous PARG protein (quantification is needed) - how might this affect the interpretation of these experiments (N.B., WT and catalytically-dead PARG were also re-expressed for the experiments shown in Figure 1, but there are no PARG immunoblots to demonstrate how much the exogenous proteins were overexpressed, or activity measurements). If regulated pADPr signaling is important for a normal S phase, then one would have thought that expressing a very high level of active PARG would create problems.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In Fig. S1E, we blotted endogenous PARG level in control cells and exogenous PARG level in reconstituted cells. The reviewer is correct that exogenous PARG expression was much higher (~10-fold) than that of endogenous PARG in WT control cells. Nevertheless, we did not observe any obvious phenotypes in PARG KO/cKO cells reconstituted with high level of exogeneous PARG, which may reflect excess PARG level/activity in wild-type control cells.</p>
