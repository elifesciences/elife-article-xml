<title>Abstract</title><p>The superior colliculus (SC) is a midbrain structure that contains one of the highest densities of inhibitory neurons in the brain and, together with the thalamocortical visual system, it plays a key role in visually guided behaviors. The SC receives direct inputs from retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) but whether excitatory and inhibitory SC neurons differentially integrate retinal activity <italic>in vivo</italic> is still largely unknown. We recently established an extracellular recording approach using high-density electrodes to measure the activity of RGCs simultaneously with their postsynaptic SC targets <italic>in vivo</italic>, that allows addressing how SC neurons integrate RGC activity. Here, we employ this method to study the functional properties and dynamics that govern retinocollicular signaling in a cell-type specific manner by identifying GABAergic SC neurons using optotagging in anesthetized VGAT- ChR2 mice. We measured 305 monosynaptically connected RGC-SC pairs, out of which approximately one third of retinal afferents connect onto inhibitory SC neurons. We show that both excitatory and inhibitory SC neurons receive comparably strong RGC inputs, with functionally similar RGC-SC pairs showing stronger connections. Our results demonstrate that similar wiring rules apply for RGCs innervation of both excitatory and inhibitory SC neurons, which is unlike the cell-type specific connectivity in the thalamocortical system. Contrasting the similar RGC-SC connection strength, we observed that RGC activity contributed more to the activity of postsynaptic excitatory SC neurons than to the activity of postsynaptic inhibitory SC neurons. This implies that the excitatory SC neurons are more specifically coupled to RGC afferent inputs, while inhibitory SC neurons may integrate additional inputs from other sources. Taken together, our study deepens the understanding of cell-type specific retinocollicular functional connectivity and emphasizes that the two major brain areas for visual processing, the visual cortex and the superior colliculus, differently integrate sensory afferent inputs.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The mouse superior colliculus (SC) is a midbrain structure that receives direct inputs from retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Drager and Hubel, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Ellis et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Huberman et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Kremkow and Alonso, 2018</xref>). Together with the visual cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Glickfeld et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Lashley, 1931</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Niell and Scanziani, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Petruno et al., 2013</xref>), the SC plays a key role in visually guided behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Evans et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Hoy et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Shang et al., 2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c104">Wei et al., 2015</xref>). Intriguingly, the visual SC layers contain one of the highest densities of inhibitory (GABAergic) neurons in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Kaneda et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Ranney Mize, 1992</xref>) suggesting that inhibition plays a key role in visual processing within the SC. Indeed, inhibitory SC neurons (INs) are known to be involved in several sensory functions including surround suppression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Kasai and Isa, 2016</xref>) and motion processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Barchini et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Gale and Murphy, 2016</xref>), but also in the regulation of wakefulness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c107">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>). However, how GABAergic SC neurons are recruited by their retinal inputs <italic>in vivo</italic> remains largely unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">Shi et al., 2017</xref>). An understanding of how RGC inputs are integrated by SC INs and SC excitatory neurons (EXNs) is crucial for reaching a mechanistic understanding of the computations within the SC microcircuit.</p>
<p>In sensory systems, the divergence of long-range afferent axons onto GABAergic and non-GABAergic neurons ensures a balance between excitation and inhibition (E/I) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Miller, 2016</xref>). For example, in sensory cortices, thalamic afferents differentially activate excitatory and local inhibitory neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Cruikshank et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Ji et al., 2016</xref>) with a stronger drive onto inhibitory neurons compared to excitatory neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Bruno and Simons, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Cruikshank et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Gabernet et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Gibson et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Inoue and Imoto, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c94">Swadlow, 2003</xref>). This stronger drive on inhibitory neurons establishes an effective feedforward inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Agmon and Connors, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Bereshpolova et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Gabernet et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Kremkow et al., 2010a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">2010b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93">Sun et al., 2006</xref>) that balances the excitation from thalamic afferents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Isaacson and Scanziani, 2011</xref>) and contributes to sharpening stimulus feature selectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Lee et al., 2012</xref>). Moreover, this wiring motif can partly be linked to the response properties of cortical inhibitory neurons as they typically show higher firing rates, broader tuning, low selectivity and high sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Alonso and Swadlow, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Bruno and Simons, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Gibson et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Kremkow et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Porter et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c97">Swadlow et al., 2002</xref>) to facilitate feedforward inhibition in response to thalamic input. Despite the importance of this afferent wiring motif for sensory processing in the thalamocortical visual circuit, it is currently unknown whether the retinocollicular pathway follows similar or different principles.</p>
<p>We recently demonstrated that SC neurons can receive strong input from RGC axons <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">Sibille et al., 2022a</xref>). Moreover, around one third of retinocollicular synapses connect onto inhibitory neurons that form intrinsic connections within the SC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c105">Whyland et al., 2020</xref>). These findings support the notion that an effective feedforward inhibition might also be at play in the retinocollicular system.</p>
<p>But whether afferent inputs are differentially integrated by excitatory and inhibitory SC neurons, similar to the thalamocortical system, is unknown. However, our previous study in the retinocollicular system lacks the cell-type specificity, and it remains an open question whether the strong drive is specific to inhibitory SC neurons or if it is a general property of retinocollicular connections, and thus cell-type independent. Therefore, whether there are any differences in connection strengths between RGCs that project to excitatory and inhibitory SC neurons remains elusive. In this study, we investigate how excitatory and inhibitory neurons in the SC integrate retinal inputs <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>
<p>We aim to answer these questions by characterizing the properties of the long-range synaptic connections between RGC-SC pairs employing a set of measurements: 1. The connection efficacy is used to study how strongly excitatory and inhibitory SC neurons are driven by their RGC input. 2. The functional similarity is analyzed between connected RGC-SC pairs to examine whether comparable wiring motifs govern retinocollicular signaling in excitatory and inhibitory neurons. 3. Short-term dynamics of retinal activity are studied to estimate whether the retinal spiking pattern shows paired-spike enhancement on retinocollicular synapses. Finally, 4. the connection contribution is employed to investigate how tightly the SC activity is coupled to retinal spiking.</p>
<p>This study intends to generate a more detailed picture of cell-type specific retinocollicular innervation and to fill a gap concerning the different long-range functional connectivity motifs that exist along the visual pathways.</p>

<title>Recording excitatory and inhibitory neurons simultaneously with RGC axons in the mouse SC <italic>in vivo</italic></title>
<p>To investigate the integration of retinal input in excitatory and inhibitory neurons in the SC <italic>in vivo</italic>, we recorded extracellular neural activity in the visual layers of SC in VGAT-ChR2 mice using high-density Neuropixels probes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Jun et al., 2017</xref>). We employed a tangential insertion approach to maximize the extent of visually driven channels in the SC (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">Sibille et al., 2022a</xref>). Notably, we recently demonstrated that this approach allows us to not only measure spiking activity from SC neurons, but also to record electrical signals from retinal ganglion cell axons (RGC) that terminate in the SC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">Sibille et al., 2022a</xref>). The somatic action potentials of SC neurons can be distinguished from the axonal action potentials of RGCs based on their spatiotemporal waveforms profile (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">Sibille et al., 2022a</xref>). RGC axonal waveforms are triphasic with a larger spatial spread (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref> left) while somatic SC neurons show a characteristic biphasic waveform profile (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>, middle and right).</p>

<p>To study cell-type specific differences, we combined the Neuropixels recordings with an optogenetic identification strategy (optotagging) to identify GABAergic SC neurons in VGAT-ChR2-EYFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c108">Zhao et al., 2011</xref>) mice (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>, B; data from n = 11 experiments in n = 9 mice included in the analysis, if not stated otherwise). In these transgenic mice, GABAergic neurons specifically express Channelrhodopsin-2 and can be identified upon blue light stimulation. To photo-activate a large proportion of GABAergic SC neurons using short light pulses (100ms pulses, 2Hz, 2.7 mW) we inserted the optic fiber perpendicularly to the Neuropixels probe (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>, right, see Material and Methods). Using this recording and light stimulation configuration we could activate GABAergic SC neurons across an average of ∼1.5 mm of SC tissue (light-activated range = 1.50 ± 0.41 mm, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>) which also allowed us to record SC neurons along continuous retinotopy (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>, right) in a cell-type specific manner (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G</xref>). We used the visually evoked activity and continuous retinotopy to demarcate the boundaries of the SC (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). Moreover, for the characterization of excitatory and inhibitory classes of SC neurons, we limited our analysis to single units that were localized within the range of optogenetic stimulation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>/C and <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1 – figure supplement 1A</xref>, see Material and Methods). Cell types were characterized using a custom-written graphic-user-interface (GUI, see Material and Methods) to label units that were activated by the LED pulse as inhibitory neurons (INs, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>, middle). These neurons were distinguished based on their reliable increase in firing rate in response to optogenetic stimulation during spontaneous (black screen) and visually evoked conditions (checkerboard stimulus, see Material and Methods). SC neurons that were not modulated by the LED pulses, but located within the light-activated range, were labeled as excitatory (EXNs, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref> bottom). Excitatory and inhibitory SC neurons were equally distributed within the boundaries of LED stimulation for 9/11 experiments (p values = 3.07×10<sup>-1</sup>, 1.15×10<sup>-2</sup>, 7.55×10<sup>-1</sup>, 8.34×10<sup>-1</sup>, 5.01×10<sup>-6</sup>, 0.79, 0.80, 0.26, 0.33, 0.08, 0.13, Wilcoxon rank-sum test). In only two experiments EXNs and INs were not equally distributed, but only 2 single units were located in the region without included SC IN units, that passed the quality criteria for spike sorting (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1 – figure supplement 1B</xref>, see Material and Methods). As expected, retinal axons were not activated by the LED pulse (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>, top), except for a few cases (4/326 RGCs) which were excluded from the connectivity analysis in this study. In total, we recorded 326 RGC axons and 680 SC neurons. Among the recorded SC neurons one third (31.2%) were GABAergic (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G</xref>, n = 468 EXNs, n = 212 INs).</p>
<p>Having sorted the SC neurons into the cell classes using optogenetic stimulation (EXNs and optogenetically identified INs) we compared different spike waveform features to test whether SC neurons show differences in their waveforms. Characterizing the spike waveforms is commonly used in the cortex or hippocampus to differentiate between glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Lee et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Moore and Wehr, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Niell and Stryker, 2008</xref>). However, the separation based on differences in waveform features was not an adequate measure to separate SC EXNs from SC INs (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure 1 – figure supplement 2</xref>). This result is in line with findings by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Essig et al. (2021)</xref> who did not observe a cell type specific difference between waveform features in the SC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Essig et al., 2021</xref>). Similar findings have been shown in the inferior colliculus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Ono et al., 2017</xref>), a neighboring midbrain structure, suggesting that waveform classification analyses used in the cortex are not suitable for distinguishing neurons in the midbrain.</p>
<p>To further characterize the response properties of the different cell classes (RGC, SC INs, SC EXNs), we measured their firing rates (FR) in response to a natural movie stimulus provided in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Froudarakis et al. (2014)</xref> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Froudarakis et al., 2014</xref>) (see Material and Methods). We found that RGCs show the highest FR (firing rate RGC: median = 7.55 spikes/s, Q1 = 2.39 spikes/s, Q3 = 17.93 spikes/s, n = 326 EXNs; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G</xref>, bottom). On average, the mean FR in SC INs (firing rate IN: median = 3.63 spikes/s, Q1 = 1.6 spikes/s, Q3 = 8.02 spikes/s, n = 212 INs) was 1.8 times higher compared to that of SC EXNs (firing rate EXN: median = 1.38 spikes/s, Q1 = 0.49 spikes/s, Q3 = 4.19 spikes/s, n = 468 INs; SC EXN vs SC IN p = 3.1567×10<sup>-15</sup>, SC EXN vs RGC p = 4.8362×10<sup>-40</sup>, SC IN vs RGC p = 2.738810<sup>-8</sup>, two-sided Wilcoxon rank-sum test). Our results are in line with previous studies by Reid (1998, 2003) showing that RGCs show high mean firing rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Kara and Reid, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c102">Usrey et al., 1998</xref>). Moreover, from other midbrain areas it is also known that GABAergic neurons show higher FRs compared to glutamatergic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Ono et al., 2017</xref>).</p>
<p>In summary, by combining Neuropixels recordings to measure the activity of RGC axons and SC neurons with optogenetic identification of GABAergic SC neurons, it becomes possible to measure monosynaptic retinocollicular connectivity <italic>in vivo</italic> and retinal innervation strength in a cell-type specific manner.</p>

<title>Retinal input integration in excitatory and inhibitory SC neurons</title>
<p>To study the monosynaptic retinocollicular connectivity <italic>in vivo</italic> and retinal innervation strength, we identified putative monosynaptically connected RGC-SC pairs employing established cross-correlation analysis (CCG) methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Alonso et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Bereshpolova et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">Sibille et al., 2022a</xref>). A significant transient and a short-latency peak in the spike train CCG is a hallmark of monosynaptic connectivity (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>) and identifies connected RGC-SC pairs. We measured up to 98 monosynaptic connections in individual recordings, depending on the number of measured RGC axons (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>). In total, we identified 305 connected RGC-SC pairs, of which 29.8% were retinal axons that connected onto GABAergic SC neurons (n = 214 connected RGC-SC EXN pairs, n = 91 connected RGC-SC IN pairs, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>/D). This high yield in monosynaptically connected pairs was due to the close proximity of the simultaneously recorded RGC axons and SC neurons on the high-density electrode (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>, bottom) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">Sibille et al., 2022a</xref>). For most of the connected RGC-SC pairs the peak channels on the electrode were on average 50-60 µm apart on the probe and hence within SC (distance RGC-EXN: median = 40.0 µm, first quartile = 25.61 µm, third quartile = 62.1 µm; distance RGC-IN: median = 51.22 µm, first quartile = 32.0 µm, third quartile = 83.08 µm). We found a significant difference in peak channel distance between RGC-SC EXN and RGC-SC IN pairs with longer distances between RGC axons and inhibitory SC neurons (p = 0.03287, two-sided Wilcoxon rank-sum test), however, the effect size was small (Cohen’s d = 0.0915). The maximum distance for retinal axons and inhibitory SC neurons was 240 µm, while the peak channels of one RGC-SC EXN pair were 960 µm apart. The latter pair might include a SC wide field neuron as these cells are excitatory and their dendritic arbor widths have been reported to spread up to 900 µm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Gale and Murphy, 2014</xref>).</p>

<p>To assess the connection strength between RGCs and excitatory and inhibitory SC neurons, we calculated the connection efficacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c101">Usrey et al., 1999</xref>). The efficacy measures the connection strength as the probability of an RGC spike triggering an action potential in the postsynaptic SC neuron (see Material and Methods). We found highly diverse connectivity patterns for RGC-SC EXC and RGC-SC IN pairs. RGC activity evoked robust firing in both SC cell types (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>, top), however, pairs with weak connection strength were also observed as recently described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">Sibille et al. (2022a)</xref> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>, bottom). Across the population, both SC cell types received similarly strong input from the retina (efficacy RGC-SC IN: median = 4.54 %, Q1 = 2.2 %, Q3 = 7.96 %, maximum = 62.05 %, n = 91 connected pairs; efficacy RGC-SC EXN: median = 3.5 %, Q1= 1.96 %, Q3 = 5.89 %, maximum = 41.12 %, n = 214 connected pairs; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>). While we observed a tendency for slightly stronger RGC-SC IN connections, this difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.053, two-sided Wilcoxon rank-sum test). To assess whether the connectivity strength is related to the firing of the postsynaptic cell, we examined the relationship between the efficacy and the overall firing rate throughout the entire recording session. Surprisingly, our results demonstrate a positive correlation between the efficacy and the mean firing rate on the population level (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2G</xref>, RGC-SC EXN r = 0.42685; p &lt; 0.0005; RGC-SC IN: r = 0.43543, p = 0.00002, two-sided Wilcoxon rank-sum test).</p>
<p>Here, we set out to explore how RGC spikes drive the activity in postsynaptic excitatory and inhibitory SC neurons. We did not find a cell-type specific difference in connection strength and therefore conclude that inhibitory and excitatory SC neurons are innervated comparably strong and are both reliably driven by their retinal inputs.</p>

<title>Functional similarity of retinocollicular connections</title>
<p>In sensory cortices, inhibitory neurons are less selective and receive a diverse and nonspecific set of thalamic inputs compared to excitatory neurons which receive more specific thalamic inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Alonso and Swadlow, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Bruno and Simons, 2002</xref>). However, the selectivity and functional similarity between RGCs and their excitatory and inhibitory target populations in SC remains largely unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">Shi et al., 2017</xref>). Despite both SC populations showing a similar innervation strength from retinal axons, inhibitory neurons could sample from a more functionally diverse population of RGCs. To test this, we characterized the functional similarity between the RGCs and their connected postsynaptic SC neurons. To this end, we calculated the correlation coefficients between the trial-averaged visually evoked activity of connected RGC-SC pairs in response to light and dark sparse noise stimuli (r<sub>SL</sub> &amp; r<sub>SD</sub>) as well as the natural movie stimulus (r<sub>NM</sub>), a phase scrambled version (r<sub>PSM</sub>) and a checkerboard stimulus (r<sub>Chk</sub>) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>/B, RGC-SC with high signal-to-noise in their receptive field, see Material and Methods). To quantify the overall functional similarity by a single similarity value, we averaged the five correlation measurements (similarity = (r<sub>SL</sub>+ r<sub>SD</sub> + r<sub>NM</sub>+ r<sub>PSM</sub> + r<sub>Chk</sub>)/5). A similarity value of 1 corresponds to perfectly correlated visually driven responses between the RGC and the postsynaptic SC neuron, while a value of 0 signifies uncorrelated responses. In our data, the RGC-SC pairs span a wide range of functional similarity, however, we found no significant difference between RGC-SC EXN and RGC-SC IN pairs (similarity for RGC-SC EXN = 0.44 ± 0.15 and RGC-SC IN = 0.37 ± 0.19, n = 85 RGC-SC EXN pairs, n = 29 RGC-SC IN pairs, p = 0.245, two-sided Wilcoxon rank-sum test, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). In a next step, we correlated the connection efficacy measure to the similarity index. The synaptic efficacy was positively correlated with the functional similarity of the connected pairs, with a stronger correlation for RGC-SC IN pairs (RGC-SC EXN r = 0.37, p = 0.0005; RGC-SC IN r = 0.44, p = 0.02, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>). Overall, we observed that functionally similar pairs are more strongly connected. However, we also observed cases of relatively strong connected RGC-SC pairs (∼10%) with low similarity (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>), suggesting that some SC neurons receive convergent input from a functionally more diverse pool of RGC afferents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">Sibille et al., 2022a</xref>). Our findings delineate that both RGC-SC EXN and RGC-SC IN connected pairs are organized, while functionally similar properties between the pre-and postsynaptic neuron are reflected in a stronger connection.</p>

<title>Paired-spike interactions of the retinocollicular connections</title>
<p>We showed that retinal spikes are efficient in driving SC activity for both excitatory and inhibitory neurons. As the timing of presynaptic activity has been assessed as a parameter that modulates postsynaptic firing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c110">Zucker, 1989</xref>) and connection strength (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Kara and Reid, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c102">Usrey et al., 1998</xref>), we wanted to know whether the temporal pattern of retinal activity has different effects on the synaptic efficacy of excitatory and inhibitory SC neurons. To that end, we studied the short-term dynamics (facilitation or depression) of the measured connections and performed a paired-spike analysis approach as described by Usrey and colleagues in 1998 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c102">Usrey et al., 1998</xref>). A pair of retinal spikes (1<sup>st</sup>, 2<sup>nd</sup> RGC) was defined by its temporal firing patterns: inter-spike interval (ISI) and dead time. We selected RGC spikes for which a 1<sup>st</sup> RGC followed the 2<sup>nd</sup> RGC by a specific ISI (minimum ISI = 5ms, maximum ISI = 30ms). The dead time ensures that the 1<sup>st</sup> RGC was preceded by a minimum period without activity (30ms) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>).</p>

<p>We found that overall 2<sup>nd</sup> retinal spikes were more efficient in driving SC activity, and thus facilitating. This was true for both RGC-SC EXN (efficacy 1<sup>st</sup> RGC: median = 1.8 %, Q1 = 0.77 %, Q3 = 4.47 %; efficacy 2<sup>nd</sup> RGC: median = 2.66 %, Q1 = 1.16 %, Q3 = 6.07 %, p 1<sup>st</sup> vs 2<sup>nd</sup> = 3.13 × 10<sup>-25</sup>, n = 214 pairs) and RGC-SC IN connected pairs (efficacy 1<sup>st</sup> RGC: median = 3.66 %, Q1 = 1.6, Q3 = 8.61; efficacy 2<sup>nd</sup> RGC: median = 4.33, Q1 = 2.03, Q3 = 8.25, p 1<sup>st</sup> vs 2<sup>nd</sup> = 1.68 × 10<sup>-6</sup>, n = 91 pairs, Wilcoxon signed-rank test) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>, C). This effect is known as paired-spike enhancement and has been reported earlier in retinogeniculate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Mastronarde, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c102">Usrey et al., 1998</xref>) and geniculocortical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c100">Usrey et al., 2000</xref>) connections. The majority of retinocollicular connected pairs showed paired-spike enhancement where 2<sup>nd</sup> retinal spikes were more effective in driving SC response (86.45% (185/214) RGC-SC EXN pairs, 80.22 % (73/91) RGC-SC IN pairs). The effect was more pronounced in RGC-SC EXN pairs where the 2<sup>nd</sup> retinal spike was 1.7 times as effective in driving responses in the postsynaptic SC neuron, while for RGC-SC IN pairs, the 2<sup>nd</sup> retinal spike was only 1.3 times more efficacious in driving SC spiking. To quantify this observation, we calculated the paired-spike ratio (PSR = efficacy 2<sup>nd</sup>/efficacy 1<sup>st</sup>) which confirmed a higher facilitation effect for RGCs connecting into excitatory neurons (PSR RGC-SC EXN = 1.711 ± 1.14; RGC-SC IN: 1.281 ± 0.414, p = 2,58 × 10<sup>-7</sup>, Wilcoxon rank-sum, n = 305 pairs, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>).</p>
<p>Previous work in the thalamocortical system has shown that weaker synaptic connections can be more strongly modulated compared to stronger synaptic connections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Ferrarese et al., 2018</xref>). To test the notion that also in the retinocollicular system, connected pairs with lower efficacy in response to 1<sup>st</sup> RGCs show greater enhancement in response to the 2<sup>nd</sup> RGCs, we correlated the efficacy of the 1<sup>st</sup> RGC to the PSR (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>). We observed a negative correlation between the logarithm of the 1<sup>st</sup> RGC efficacy and the logarithm of PSR for both RGC-SC EXN (r = 0.3314, p = 7.0148 × 10<sup>-7</sup>, n = 214 pairs) and RGC-SC IN pairs (r = 0.4767, p = 1.7714 × 10<sup>-6</sup>, n = 91 pairs). However, we found pairs that show low efficacy in response to the 1<sup>st</sup> RGC and low PSR. Taken together, we observed paired-spike enhancement in RGCs connecting onto both inhibitory and excitatory SC neurons, with a stronger facilitation effect for retinal afferents connecting onto excitatory, in comparison to inhibitory, SC target neurons. To estimate whether the ISI interval has an effect on the PSR, we added another group of 2-30 ms ISI interval to include RGCs that fire at high frequencies (PSR RGC-SC EXN = 1.783 ± 1.23; RGC-SC IN: 1.295 ± 0.528, p = 7.03 × 10<sup>-6</sup>, Wilcoxon rank-sum, n = 305 pairs, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>). However, we did not observe a clear difference between the 2-30 and 5-30 ms groups for inhibitory connections (SC IN: p = 0.604, Wilcoxon signed-rank test). In contrast, the two different ISI groups of excitatory neurons show a statistically significant difference (p = 0.011, Wilcoxon signed-rank test), however, the effect size is small (Cohen’s d RGC-SC EXN = 0.063, RGC-SC IN = 0.030).</p>

<title>Inhibitory SC neurons are less coupled to the retina compared to excitatory SC neurons</title>
<p>Our data so far reveals that excitatory and inhibitory SC neurons receive similarly strong drive from their retinal afferents. However, we observed a higher mean firing rate in SC INs compared to SC EXNs, on average (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G</xref>), which is intriguing given the similarity in the RGC drive on both cell types. A possible explanation could be that the activity of SC INs is less coupled to the RGC inputs as compared to that of SC EXNs, i.e. SC INs spikes are less often driven by their RGC inputs. To examine how strongly the activity of the two populations of SC neurons is coupled to the activity of individual RGC inputs, we estimated the synaptic coupling strength from the connection contribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Levick et al., 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">Sibille et al., 2022a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c101">Usrey et al., 1999</xref>) of the measured retinocollicular pairs. The connection contribution reflects the fraction of postsynaptic SC spikes that are preceded by a presynaptic retinal spike within a short time window (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). High contribution values indicate that SC neurons are primarily driven by individual RGC afferent inputs, while low contribution values point towards an integration of multiple inputs.</p>

<p>Interestingly, we found that the contribution of individual retinal spikes on SC activity was higher for excitatory compared to inhibitory SC neurons (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>) (contribution RGC-SC EXN: median = 18.27% Q1 = 10.79%, Q3 = 29.69%, n = 214; contribution RGC-SC IN: median = 12.2%, Q1 = 6.61%, Q3 = 23.02%, n = 91 connected pairs, p = 0.0003, two-sided Wilcoxon rank-sum test). This opens up the possibility that SC EXNs might be more specifically linked to the retinal input compared to SC INs. To assess the relationship between the coupling strength and the functional similarity, we correlated both measures and found a positive correlation, suggesting that stronger coupled pairs show higher similarity (RGC-SC EXN r = 0.541, p = 8.9 ×10<sup>-8</sup>, n = 85 pairs; RGC-SC IN (r = 0.461, p = 0.012, n = 29 pairs, Pearson correlation coefficient test, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>). Moreover, we observed a diversity of firing rates in both SC EXNs and SC INs (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G</xref>) which suggests that low contribution values are related to the mean firing rates of the SC neurons. And indeed, when we correlated the contribution to the mean firing rate, we found a negative correlation for both RGC-SC EXN and RGC-SC IN pairs (RGC-SC EXN r = -0.15079, p = 0.02742; RGC-SC IN r = -0.48386, p &lt; 0.00000, Pearson correlation coefficient test n = 214 RGC-EXN; n = 91 RGC-IN connected pairs) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref> and <xref rid="fig5s" ref-type="fig">Figure 5– figure supplement 1</xref>).</p>
<p>Taken together, the cell-type specific difference in retinal coupling strength suggests that retinal input contributes a substantial part to the spiking activity of excitatory SC neurons, while inhibitory SC neurons seem to also integrate inputs from other sources. This finding denotes that excitatory SC neurons are more tightly linked to the retinal input compared to inhibitory SC neurons.</p>

Our findings allow the following conclusions: (1) The retinal drive is similarly strong for RGCs connecting onto GABAergic and non-GABAergic SC neurons. (2) The connection strength between the RGCs and both SC cell classes is positively correlated with their functional similarity, while still allowing for the presence of strong connections with low functional similarity. (3) Paired-spike enhancement in RGC-SC connections was a signature for both excitatory and inhibitory SC neurons. Finally, (4) the contribution of a retinal spike to overall SC firing is higher in excitatory SC neurons compared to inhibitory SC neurons.</p>
<p>We studied retinocollicular connectivity strength and aimed to answer the question whether excitatory and inhibitory SC populations use similar or different coding schemes to integrate visual information compared to the thalamocortical visual system. Connectivity patterns and circuit motifs have been extensively studied in the thalamocortical system, yet our understanding of the encoding mechanisms that govern retinocollicular signaling remains rudimentary albeit recent studies suggest that feedforward inhibition might be at play (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c103">Villalobos et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c105">Whyland et al., 2020</xref>). While cortical inhibitory neurons are more strongly activated by thalamic axons compared to excitatory neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Bruno and Simons, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Cruikshank et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Ji et al., 2016</xref>), our results now show that in the SC, the afferent retinal drive is comparably strong on excitatory and inhibitory neurons. This finding is intriguing and suggests that the two major visual brain structures in the vertebrate brain, the visual cortex and the SC, integrate afferent sensory information differentially.</p>
<p>Several parameters for example the degree of convergence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Kara and Reid, 2003</xref>), response properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Alonso et al., 2001</xref>), synaptic mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Cruikshank et al., 2007</xref>) or spiking patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c102">Usrey et al., 1998</xref>) can have meaningful effects on modulating the input strength on the target cell. SC neurons receive input from a small number (4-6) of RGCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Chandrasekaran et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Furman et al., 2013</xref>). In contrast, cortical neurons receive numerous (approximately one order of magnitude more) thalamic inputs that are usually weak (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Bruno and Sakmann, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Jin et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Lien and Scanziani, 2018</xref>). Overall, we observed strong retinal drive onto both SC populations indicated by high efficacy values (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>), and thus individual inputs may be sufficiently strong to drive the SC neuron. This is in contrast to thalamocortical inputs, where individually efficacy values are low, but the thalamic drive is boosted by synchronously active thalamic inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Alonso et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Bruno and Sakmann, 2006</xref>). Our recording method allows for the simultaneous recording of multiple RGC afferents from SC neurons making it possible to evaluate how the synchrony among RGC afferents modulates the firing of postsynaptic SC neurons in future studies.</p>
<p>The difference in connection strength between cortical excitatory and inhibitory neurons could be partly attributed to their differences in response properties. Cortical inhibitory neurons display higher sensitivity, receive more convergent thalamic input, have higher firing rates and sample more randomly while excitatory neurons receive highly functional specific thalamic input (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Kyriazi et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Reid and Alonso, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">Simons and Carvell, 1989</xref>). While we observed higher firing rates in inhibitory SC neurons (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G</xref>), the efficacy of the RGC-SC connections was comparable between both types of neurons (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>), suggesting that the sensitivity of both neuron types is not markedly disparate. In general, visual response properties between excitatory and inhibitory neurons in the SC may not differ to such a great extent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Inayat et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Kasai and Isa, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">Shi et al., 2017</xref>), (but see (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Barchini et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Li and Meister, 2022</xref>)), and experiments in the inferior colliculus show that GABAergic and glutamatergic cells share similar response properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Ono et al., 2017</xref>). These observations imply that in the SC and other parts of the midbrain, the cell-type specific difference in terms of selectivity might not be as strongly separated as in the cortex. Future studies are required to deeper investigate the differences in response properties of the subclasses of SC neurons and whether these properties are correlated to the RGC-SC connection strength. The positive correlation between efficacy and overall mean firing rate (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2G</xref>), is intriguing. It suggests that highly excited SC neurons may transmit RGC inputs more efficaciously. Interestingly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Jouhanneau et al. (2018)</xref> reported a negative correlation between the distance of the excitatory postsynaptic potential peak to the action potential threshold and the efficacy (synaptic gain) in cortical PV neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Jouhanneau et al., 2018</xref>). Unfortunately, due to the inherent limitations of our extracellular recording approach, we are unable to investigate this aspect in our dataset. These findings underscore the complexity of synaptic transmission and wiring specificity and the multiple factors by which it can be influenced.</p>
<p>In our results, we observed an overall trend that functionally similar RGC-SC pairs show stronger connections which was true for both excitatory and inhibitory pairs (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). However, we also found pairs with considerably strong retinocollicular connectivity (efficacy values &gt;10%) albeit the functional similarity between these connected cells was low (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>). This observation suggests that SC neurons may either show high projection-specificity by integrating inputs from a functional homogeneous population of RGCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Li and Meister, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">Shi et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">Sibille et al., 2022a</xref>) or receive diverse inputs from multiple functional RGC types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Li and Meister, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">Sibille et al., 2022a</xref>). Moreover, a high degree of projection-specificity was recently shown to be maintained even disynaptically towards brain regions downstream of the SC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Reinhard et al., 2019</xref>), suggesting that at least one important role of the RGC-SC projection is to preserve the representation of the functionally diverse retinal channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Baden et al., 2016</xref>). In our study, we investigated the functional similarity between connected RGC-SC pairs in response to sparse and dense noise stimuli as well as natural movie stimuli. And while we observed a diversity among the similarities between RGCs and connected targets in SC, supporting the idea that SC neurons may follow diverse wiring motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">Sibille et al., 2022a</xref>), we observed no clear difference between inhibitory and excitatory SC neurons (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). To further address the influence of functional properties on wiring mechanisms, it would be interesting to target the pool of distinct RGC types and to study how strongly they recruit SC subpopulations and modulate postsynaptic responses of their targets.</p>
<p>Temporal dynamics of presynaptic activity patterns are known to play a role in modulating synaptic strength (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c102">Usrey et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c110">Zucker, 1989</xref>). To study how the temporal spiking pattern of the RGC activity shapes RGC-SC connectivity, we analyzed the paired-spike dynamics. Across the population, we found a facilitating effect where responses to 2<sup>nd</sup> retinal spikes were more efficient in driving SC activity for both SC neuron populations. However, the paired-spike enhancement was more pronounced for excitatory than inhibitory neurons (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>). Moreover, our observation highlights differences in the encoding strategies used by different regions of visual processing. While retinogeniculate connections show paired-spike enhancement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c102">Usrey et al., 1998</xref>), thalamocortical and corticotectal synapses express mostly depressing dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Bereshpolova et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c97">Swadlow et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c96">Swadlow and Gusev, 2001</xref>), but see (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c100">Usrey et al., 2000</xref>). Our data now reveals that retinocollicular connections facilitate, suggesting that the temporal integration of RGC inputs by SC neurons may be similar to the visual thalamus (dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus “dLGN”). The dLGN serves as another main target of RGC axons, however, in the mouse, the dLGN mainly consists of relay neurons, and only approximately 6% of inhibitory neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Butler, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Evangelio et al., 2018</xref>). This disparity in interneuron density makes it challenging to directly compare the SC and dLGN circuits. Despite this difference, there exists a common synaptic motif between the dLGN and the SC. RGC axons innervating the dLGN form triadic arrangements with excitatory and inhibitory neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">Sherman, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c106">Wilson et al., 1984</xref>) and this arrangement can also be found in the SC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c105">Whyland et al., 2020</xref>). It has been shown that GAD67 is a suitable marker to target the inhibitory neurons involved in the triadic motif in the SC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c105">Whyland et al., 2020</xref>) and therefore, it would be interesting to study retinal connectivity in the context of these triads in the SC using GAD67 mice.</p>
<p>In our study, we used cross-correlograms that were calculated from spike trains throughout the full recording period, to be applied on different connectivity strength measures. However, paired-spike dynamics are known to be modulated by the local temporal structure of inputs, for example the visual stimulus presented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c102">Usrey et al., 1998</xref>). In addition, facilitating and depressing effects can change with the target population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Bereshpolova et al., 2006</xref>). Further studies are required to investigate whether the facilitating effect observed in our study changes upon targeting defined collicular subpopulations that may have differences in firing rates or during different stimulus conditions (e.g. spontaneous and stimulus evoked). In this study, retinocollicular connectivity was measured in anesthetized conditions. For future studies it would be interesting to examine connectivity dynamics and innervation strength in awake conditions as it has been shown that retinocollicular synapses are modulated by the animals’ level of arousal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Schröder et al., 2020</xref>). Likewise, more than 30 different types of RGCs have been characterized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Baden et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Sanes and Masland, 2015</xref>) and understanding how specific RGC types relay information onto the different SC neuron types would be important to address in more detail in future studies. Moreover, previous studies have shown a relationship between the response properties of SC neurons and their location along the dorsal/ ventral axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Liu et al., 2023</xref>) and differences in the density and size of retinocollicular terminals along this axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Carter et al., 1991</xref>). Exploring this aspect further utilizing a vertical recording approach could provide valuable insights in the context of functional organization.</p>
<p>Despite our observation that retinal drive is similarly strong onto both SC cell types, the contribution of retinal activity to individual SC neurons firing was higher in excitatory SC neurons. This opens up the possibility that excitatory SC neurons may be more specifically linked to retinal inputs, while inhibitory SC cells might receive excitation from other sources aside from the retina. This finding raises the question on what other sources could drive spiking in inhibitory SC neurons?
<list list-type="order">
<list-item><p>RGCs provide the main input to the superficial SC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Ellis et al., 2016</xref>) with limited convergence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">Sibille et al., 2022a</xref>). Nonetheless, the convergence may be higher for RGCs connecting onto inhibitory SC neurons which could explain the lower contribution and higher mean firing rates we found in inhibitory neurons. However, it has to be considered that our <italic>in vivo</italic> recording technique is limited in capturing the total pool of converging RGC inputs onto a neuron (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">Sibille et al., 2022a</xref>). Moreover, it has been shown that different types of RGCs exhibit variations in their axonal diameter, and this diameter is associated with how these cells relay information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Perge et al., 2009</xref>). As a result, our recording approach may have a tendency to capture signals from RGCs with high firing rates that are located in close proximity to the Neuropixels probe. Viral retrograde transsynaptic tracing methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Muellner and Roska, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Rompani et al., 2017</xref>), could be employed to study the full presynaptic RGC pool of single SC neurons.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>In addition to retinal inputs, the SC receives extensive projections from the visual cortex (V1) that could act as a potential candidate to excite inhibitory neurons. And while indeed GABAergic horizontal cells have been shown to receive V1 input (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c109">Zingg et al., 2017</xref>), the majority (93%) of corticotectal terminals target the dendrites of non-GABAergic neurons in the SC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Masterson et al., 2019</xref>). Therefore, more work is needed and studying V1 excitation to defined inhibitory SC subpopulations will be an important topic to be investigated by the use of tracing studies and will shed light into this complexity.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Intracollicular connections can provide a source of recurrent excitation on SC neurons, amplifying the retinal drive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">Shi et al., 2017</xref>). However, the cell-type specificity of the intracollicular amplification is still debated. For example, while GAD2-positive horizontal cells receive excitatory inputs from stellate cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Gale and Murphy, 2018</xref>), intracollicular connectivity originating from neighboring excitatory cell types such as narrow-field (NF) and wide-field (WF) cells has shown to be rare (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Gale and Murphy, 2018</xref>). Next-generation <italic>in vitro</italic> multi-neuron patch-clamp recordings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Campagnola et al., 2022</xref>) could reveal important new insights into the cell-type specific (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Ayupe et al., 2023</xref>) intracollicular wiring.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>In addition, collicular neurons in the visual layers also get inputs from deeper SC layers. However, excitatory connections from deep SC to the upper layers are rather uncommon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Gale and Murphy, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Ghitani et al., 2014</xref>). Despite these studies have highlighted different sources of excitation onto inhibitory SC neurons, further studies are required that elucidate the role and strength of input that deep SC layers or external sources provide to drive inhibitory SC populations.</p></list-item>

In this study, we recorded populations of well-isolated single units including RGCs as well as GABAergic and non-GABAergic SC neurons in VGAT-ChR2 mice <italic>in vivo</italic>. Our approach using VGAT-ChR2 mice to target all types of inhibitory SC neurons that express the vesicular GABA transporter VGAT enables a first impression on how inhibitory neurons sculpt retinocollicular signaling. Our inhibitory population is made up of 30% of the recorded SC neurons and connected pairs. These observations are in line with previous findings showing that in the upper SC layers, a substantial part of neurons (30%) are GABAergic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Ranney Mize, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c105">Whyland et al., 2020</xref>) and that around one third of the postsynaptic targets of retinocollicular terminals are GABAergic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Boka et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c105">Whyland et al., 2020</xref>).</p>
<p>In the last decade, the diversity of SC cell types has been mainly characterized based on morphology and response properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Franceschi and Solomon, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Ito et al., 2017</xref>). Morphologically and functionally, four distinct classes of retinorecipient SC neurons have been identified: stellate, horizontal, wide-field and narrow field neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Gale and Murphy, 2016</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">2014</xref>). Excitatory SC cell types such as wide-field, stellate and narrow-field cells differ in morphological characteristics. This morphological diversity might also be linked to how these cells integrate inputs from the retina. Smaller cells, such as narrow-field (NF) and stellate cells, typically have smaller RF sizes. Their limited dendritic arborization enables them to selectively respond to specific visual features. NF neurons show strong direction selectivity (DS) suggesting that these cells might be strongly driven by the retina, likely from DS-RGCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Gale and Murphy, 2014</xref>). In contrast, wide-field cells have extensive dendritic arbors and large RF sizes. These cells likely integrate inputs from multiple RGC axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Gale and Murphy, 2014</xref>).</p>
<p>The use of genetic mouse lines provides a valuable tool for understanding the circuitry and functional roles of different neuron classes by selectively targeting specific cell types. Advanced techniques have started to shed light on this diversity by providing cell-type characterizations on the molecular level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Barchini et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Gale and Murphy, 2018</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Li and Meister, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c103">Villalobos et al., 2018</xref>). Three categories of potential GABAergic interneurons have been classified in the SC by the use of Cre-lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c105">Whyland et al., 2020</xref>) that can be further subdivided into intrinsic interneurons and potential projection neurons. A recent study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c99">Tsai et al. (2022)</xref> has mapped retinocollicular connectivity by targeting specific RGC-SC circuits using a novel approach (Trans-Seq) to classify subsets of SC cell-types that are innervated by genetically defined RGC types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c99">Tsai et al., 2022</xref>). They identified five inhibitory clusters of retinorecipient SC cells that allow to specifically map retinocollicular connectivity. In addition, 12 distinct inhibitory subtypes across the entire SC circuit have been recently identified using single-nucleus RNA sequencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Ayupe et al., 2023</xref>). Thus, we are at an enthralling stage where information on SC cell-types finally becomes available based on gene expression patterns, alike to the cortical circuit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c98">Tremblay et al., 2016</xref>). Likewise investigating how optogenetic manipulation of SC INs modulates functional properties of recorded SC EXNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Gale and Murphy, 2016</xref>) is crucial for gaining a mechanistic understanding of visual processing within the SC circuitry. Hence, a key step forward would be to leverage the tracing and transcriptomics studies and combine these methods with our high-density recording approach to enable a finer characterization of the collicular interneuron diversity and the complexity of their connectivity patterns <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>
<p>Taken together, our study targeted a heterogeneous population of GABAergic neurons in VGAT-ChR2 mice and our results reveal that excitatory and inhibitory neurons in the two main brain areas for visual processing, the visual cortex and the superior colliculus, integrate sensory afferent inputs in different ways.</p>

Adult VGAT-ChR2 (Slc32a1-COP4∗H134R/EYFP, The Jackson Laboratory, stock no. 014548, n= 9) transgenic mice of either sex were used to activate inhibitory neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c108">Zhao et al., 2011</xref>).

<title>Surgical procedures</title>
<p>All experiments were conducted in VGAT-ChR2 mice of both sexes. Mice were induced with 2.0- 2.5% isoflurane (CP-Pharma) in an induction chamber and transferred to the surgery. Once anesthetized, the surgery was performed in a stereotactic frame (Narishige) with a closed-loop temperature controller (FHC DC) for monitoring the animal’s body temperature and maintaining it at 37°C. The isoflurane level was gradually lowered during surgery and maintained at 0.8-1.5% while ensuring a complete absence of vibrissa twitching or responses to tactile stimulation. During surgery, the eyes were protected with eye ointment (Vidisic, Bausch+Lomb). Mice were head-fixed in the frame, and the skull was exposed. The head was aligned along the anterior-posterior axis and marks were made for the craniotomy at 600-1500 μm ML and 0-1500 μm AP from Lambda (Paxinos and Franklin, Nixdorf 2007 stereotactic atlas) using a micromanipulator (Luigs and Neumann). For optotagging experiments, an additional mark for the optic fiber placement was made at 3500 μm AP, 500-1200 μm ML to Bregma. A headpost was placed on the skull and implanted with dental cement (Paladur). Dental cement was also used to build a recording chamber to provide a bath for grounding. During this step, a silver wire (AG-10W, Science Products) was attached to the dental cement chamber for grounding. It is important to keep the dental cement chamber low enough on the anterior and posterior sides to allow for the shallow angle probe and fiber implantations, see Sibille et al (2022) for a detailed description of the method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">Sibille et al., 2022b</xref>). Craniotomies were made at the marked positions using a dental drill (Johnson-Promident). To allow for the probe insertion at a horizontal angle between 15° and 20°, a small part of the skull at the posterior part of the craniotomy was slightly thinned using the drill to ensure a smooth insertion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">Sibille et al., 2022b</xref>).</p>

<title>Anesthetized extracellular recordings and optogenetic stimulation</title>
<p>Electrophysiological recordings in SC were performed in 9 anesthetized mice of both sexes (4 female, 5 male) using Neuropixels 1.0 probes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Jun et al., 2017</xref>). Data were acquired at a sampling rate of 30 kHz using the Open Ephys acquisition software and GUI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">Siegle et al., 2017</xref>) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.open-ephys.org">www.open-ephys.org</ext-link>) and the PXIe hardware acquisition system (National Instrument NI-PXIe-1071). The signal was amplified and stored in both the local field potential band (LFP, high pass-filtered 0-300 Hz) and the action potential band (AP, 300 Hz to 3 kHz). The tangential recordings along the anterior-posterior axis in SC were performed as described in Sibille et al. (2022) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">Sibille et al., 2022a</xref>). The fiber for optogenetic stimulation was inserted in the SC prior to the Neuropixels probe implantation to decrease mechanical pressure and reduce drift of the electrode probe. The angled optogenetic fiber was zeroed at the brain surface and inserted from the anterior in a 60-70° angle towards the AP axis (see <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>) and slowly lowered using a manual micromanipulator until reaching an insertion of 150-200 μm. Following the fiber implantation, the Neuropixels probe was inserted tangentially in a 15 to 20° angle in the superior colliculus (SC) using a micromanipulator (NewScale). The probe was zeroed at Lambda and inserted 500-1200 μm ML and 2800-3800 µm DV. After the Neuropixels probe was implanted, the optic fiber was lowered further slowly (to a maximum insertion depth of ∼250 µm) and LED pulses were applied to test for optogenetic activation of cells. After correct placement, the probe and fiber were allowed to settle for 15-20 minutes before data acquisition was started. In addition, confirmation of probe placement within the SC was done via receptive field (RF) mapping to check the number of channels with RFs. RFs were estimated from the multi-unit activity (MUA) using spike-triggered average (STA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">Sibille et al., 2022b</xref>) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>).</p>

<title>Optotagging to identify GABAergic neurons in VGAT-ChR2 mice</title>
<p>We identified (“optotagged”) populations of single GABAergic SC neurons via Channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) activation in VGAT-ChR2 mice. The optic fiber was calibrated prior to each experiment to ensure a stable light output (2.5mW) measured at the fiber tip. Before the electrode probe insertion (see above), the optic fiber (NA .66, 200 μm core diameter, with a bare fiber tip, PlexBright, Plexon) coupled to a blue (470 nm) LED module (PlexBright, Plexon) was inserted using a 60-70° angle tilted towards the AP axis (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). Blue light pulses were used to evoke spiking activity in VGAT-expressing neurons and to verify the proper alignment of the optic fiber and the Neuropixels probe. If no optogenetically evoked neuronal activity was observed, either the fiber was lowered to a maximum of 250 μm or the probe position was re-adjusted to ensure both the activation and recording of GABAergic SC neurons. Once the Neuropixels electrode probe and optic fiber were properly aligned, optogentic stimulation using either a square wave or Gaussian function stimulus pulse was applied to identify light-activated channels (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>, B). As the stimulation using a square wave pulse led to the induction of light artefacts in the spiking response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Jun et al., 2017</xref>), we manually removed these artefacts in a post-processing step by interpolating the raw values in each channel during the onset and offset of the square pulse in 2 out of 11 experiments. In order to decrease light artefacts induced by the sharp light onset in the square wave pulse, we changed the pulse to using a Gaussian function stimulus pulse to gradually increase light intensity in the remaining 8 experiments. The light pulses were applied during spontaneous conditions (presentation of a black background, 100 ms pulse duration, 2 Hz, 200 trials, 2.7- 3.5 mW measured at the fiber tip) and conditions with visually evoked activity (checkerboard stimulus, 1000 ms pulse duration, 30 trials ON, 30 trials OFF, 2.7- 3.5 mW measured at the fiber tip, n = 10/11 experiments). Both stimulation protocols were shown twice within the recording to ensure stable responses throughout the recording session. GABAergic neurons were identified by their increased short-latency responses to blue light stimulation pulses. When we compared the visually evoked responses to those induced by ChR2 activation we found that they varied in their temporal activation profile (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>, C). The response to the visual sparse noise stimulus starts ∼80ms after the stimulus onset (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>) while responses induced by ChR2 activation had a shorter latency following light onset (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>).</p>

<title>Histology</title>
<p>For histological reconstruction of the electrode track, the probe was removed, coated with fluorescent dye (DiI, Abcam-ab145311) and re-inserted in the same location. In a few experiments we performed multiple recordings and only stained the last insertion. Subsequently, the animal was terminated with an excess of isoflurane (&gt; 4%). Cardiac perfusion was performed with phosphate buffer saline (PBS) followed by 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS. Brains were post-fixed overnight in 4% PFA, and stored in PBS until slicing (100 μm) on a vibratome (Leica VT1000S). The brain slices were mounted using a mounting medium containing DAPI (DAPI-Flouromount-G, Biozol Cat. 0100-20). Slices were imaged on a fluorescence microscope using a 2.5 x objective for post hoc visualization of the electrode probe track.</p>

<title>Waveform classification to identify RGC axons and SC neurons</title>
<p>A waveform classification approach was applied to distinguish action potentials (APs) from retinal ganglion cell (RGC) axons and somatic APs from SC neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">Sibille et al., 2022a</xref>). In brief, we calculated the multi-channel waveform (MCW) which reflects the spatiotemporal profile of the AP signals. Afferent axons and somatic signals could be classified based on their distinct waveform which allowed us to classify clusters into afferent axon AP vs somatic AP. In essence, due to the SC electrode probe implantation along the anterior-posterior (AP) axis, the electrode captures signals from retinal axons that innervate the SC along the electrode channels. This propagation of RGC axonal action potentials along the axonal path is visible in the spatiotemporal profile of their multi-channel waveforms (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>, left).</p>

<title>Post hoc separation of GABAergic and non-GABAergic SC neurons</title>
<p>To study retinal input integration in a cell-type specific manner, we used a method to separate the neural responses of GABAergic neurons from that of excitatory neurons in the SC. First, we identified the minimum and maximum recording sites on the probe that were photo-activated. These borders were defined via the minimum and maximum peak channel of light-induced units that are activated on the probe. SC neurons that did not fall inside this optogenetic stimulation range (identified by their peak channel) were excluded from further analysis. We employed stringent criteria for determining the boundaries of LED evoked response and selection of neurons to be included (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1 – figure supplement 1</xref>). The distribution of excitatory and inhibitory SC neurons is not significantly different for 9/11 experiments (Wilcoxon rank-sum, p values = 0.307, 0.0115, 0.7.55, 0.834, 5.01×10<sup>-6</sup>, 0.79, 0.80, 0.26, 0.33, 0.08, 0.13). In the two significantly different experiments only 2 RGC-SC EXN pairs were located in the region without identified SC INs, and thus will not affect the results. SC neurons were separated based on their short-latency increase in responses to blue light pulses during two different protocols: (1) baseline activity (black background, 100 ms pulse duration, 2 Hz pulse frequency) and (2) during a checkerboard stimulus (1000 ms pulse duration, 30 trials LED ON, 30 trials LED OFF). This classification was done using a custom-written graphical-user-interface (GUI) approach where units were labeled as either “light-responsive”, “non light-responsive”. The labeling step was conducted by three independent observers. A unit was included if 2 out of 3 observers chose the same label. Units with unstable firing throughout the recording period were excluded from further analysis.</p>

<title>Identification of synaptically connected RGC-SC pairs</title>
<p>Monosynaptic connections between RGC axons and SC neurons were detected using established methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Bereshpolova et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Clay Reid and Alonso, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Denman and Contreras, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c102">Usrey et al., 1998</xref>) based on statistically significant peaks at synaptic delays. Briefly, we calculated a jittered (timescale jitter 5 ms) version of each spike train by randomizing all spike times within a consecutive 10-15 ms window (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c92">Smith and Kohn, 2008</xref>). We then calculated the cross-correlation between a pair of neurons both for the original (raw CCG) and the jittered spike train (jittered CCG). Subtracting the jittered CCG from the raw CCG results in a jitter-corrected version of the CCG which was used for monosynaptic pairs detection. Connected pairs were identified using cross-correlation analysis and significant peaks (peak detection window from + 0.5 to 3.5 ms) had to extend over the threshold (baseline + 4x standard deviation) for at least 5 consecutive time bins (0.1 ms resolution) (as described previously, in Sibille et al. (2022) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">Sibille et al., 2022a</xref>). The cross-correlations were calculated using the Python pycorrelate package (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/tritemio/pycorrelate">https://github.com/tritemio/pycorrelate</ext-link>). Please note that for CCG analysis, spike trains were correlated over the full recording duration, except for periods with optogenetic stimulation. Latencies to peak response were calculated from the CCGs as the maximum time within the response window.</p>

<title>Analysis of retinocollicular connection strength</title>
<p>Synaptic efficacy and contribution measures of connected RGC-SC pairs were estimated from spiketrains during the entire recording session (except for optotagging periods which were excluded) using standard approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Bereshpolova et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Clay Reid and Alonso, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c95">Swadlow and Gusev, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c102">Usrey et al., 1998</xref>). Briefly, efficacy was estimated from the baseline-corrected CCGs by dividing the area of the CCG peak (baseline window: &gt; -1 to &lt; 0.4 ms, peak window: &gt;0.4 to &lt;3.5 ms) by the total number of presynaptic spikes. Thus, an efficacy measure of 1 (100%) would reflect that for each presynaptic retinal spike, a postsynaptic spike could be detected. To estimate the connection contribution, we counted the number of SC spikes that were preceded by a retinal afferent spike, integrated over a time window between -3 to -0.5 ms, and divided this number by the total number of SC spikes. A contribution of 1 (100%) indicates that all spikes of an SC neuron are preceded by retinal afferent spikes.</p>

<title>Paired-spike dynamics analysis</title>
<p>For estimation of paired-spike dynamics, baseline-corrected CCGs were re-calculated triggered on 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> RGCs using the same baseline and peak windows as mentioned above. We identified pairs of retinal spikes (1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> RGC) for each RGC-SC connected pair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c102">Usrey et al., 1998</xref>). Briefly, a pair of retinal spikes was defined by a specific inter-spike interval (ISI) where the second RGC spike followed the 1<sup>st</sup> RGC by a ISI of 5 to 30 ms. The second criterion for classifying a pair of retinal spikes was a certain dead time where the 1<sup>st</sup> retinal spike was preceded by a minimum period of silence (dead time: 30ms). The dead time criterion was applied to ensure a comparable level of activity immediately preceding all first spikes. The preceding window (&gt; -1 to &lt; 0.4 ms) was used as a baseline window. Paired-spike enhancement was calculated as the ratio of efficacy for the 2<sup>nd</sup> RGC to the efficacy for the 1<sup>st</sup> RGC.</p>

<title>Functional similarity analysis of retinocollicular connected pairs</title>
<p>To characterize the functional similarity between connected RGCs and the target neurons in the SC, we estimated the functional similarity index. To do so, we calculated the correlation coefficients from responses during the light and dark sparse noise (r<sub>SL</sub> and r<sub>SD</sub>) as well as during the natural movie stimulus (r<sub>NM</sub>), phase scrambled movie (r<sub>PSM</sub>) and during a checkerboard stimulus (r<sub>Chk</sub>). The similarity index was calculated between the responses of the RGC and the responses of the postsynaptic SC neuron. As a result, the similarity index reflects the degree of similarity in the responses of the connected pairs. The correlation of activity during sparse noise stimuli (r<sub>SL</sub> and r<sub>SD</sub>) was estimated from the spatiotemporal receptive fields (STRFs) which were calculated from the STA. The similarity during the other stimuli (r<sub>NM</sub>, r<sub>PSM</sub> and r<sub>Chk</sub>) were calculated from the PSTHs. We limited this analysis step to neurons with high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in the visually evoked activity (SNR &gt; 8 for the STRFs). The overall similarity index was then calculated from the averaged correlation coefficients functional similarity index = (r<sub>SD</sub> + r<sub>SL</sub> + r<sub>NM</sub> + r<sub>PSM</sub> + r<sub>Chk</sub>)/5.</p>

<p>This <bold>valuable</bold> study contributes to understanding how retinal activity shapes the response properties of excitatory and inhibitory neurons in a major visual target, the superior colliculus. The evidence supporting the claim is <bold>convincing</bold>: the work is technically excellent yet the interpretation of these results assumes an unbiased sampling and integration of the RGC axon in the SC, a caveat pointed out by the authors. Overall, this study provides insights into the integration of visual information from the eye to the brain, and this work will be of interest to visual neuroscientists.</p>

<p>Gehr and colleagues used an elegant method, using neuropixels probes, to study retinal input integration by mouse superior collicular cells in vivo. Compared to a previous report of the same group, they opto-tagged inhibitory neurons and defined the differential integration onto each group. Through these experiments, the author concluded that overall, there is no clear difference between the retina connectivity to excitatory and inhibitory superior colliculus neurons. The exception to that rule is that excitatory neurons might be driven slightly stronger than inhibitory ones. Technically, this work is performed at a high level, and the plots are beautifully conceived, but I have doubts if the interpretation given by the authors is solid. I will elaborate below.</p>
<p>Some thoughts about the interpretation of the results.</p>
<p>My main concern is the &quot;survivor bias&quot; of this work, which can lead to skewed conclusions. From the data set acquired, 305 connections were measured, 1/3 inhibitory and 2/3 excitatory. These connections arise from 83 RGC onto 124 RGC (I'm interpreting the axis of Fig.2 C). Here it is worth mentioning that different RGC types have different axonal diameters (Perge et al., 2009). Here the diameter is also related to the way cells relay information (max frequencies, for example). It is possible that thicker axons are easier to measure, given the larger potential changes would likely occur, and thus, selectively being picked up by the neuropixels probe. If this is the case, we would have a clear case of &quot;survival bias&quot;, which should be tested and discussed. One way to determine if the response properties of axonal termini are from an unbiased sample is to make a rough functional characterization as generally performed (see Baden et al. 2006). This is fundamental since all other conclusions are based on unbiased sampling.</p>
<p>One aspect that is not clear to me is to measure of connectivity strength in Figure 2. Here it seems that connectivity strength is directly correlated with the baseline firing rate of the SC neuron (see example plots). If this is a general case, the synaptic strength can be assumed but would only differ in strength due to the excitability of the postsynaptic cell. This should be tested by plotting the correlation coefficient analysis against the baseline firing rate.</p>
<p>My third concern is the assessment of functional similarity in Fig. 3. It is not clear to me why the similarity value was taken by the arithmetic mean. For example, even if the responses are identical for one connected pair that exclusively responds either to the ON or OFF sparse noise, the maximal value can only be 0.67. Perhaps I misunderstood something. Secondly, correlations in natural(istic) movies can differ dramatically depending on the frame rate that the movie was acquired and the way it is displayed to the animal. What looks natural to us will elicit several artifacts at a retinal level, e.g., due to big jumps between frames (no direction-selective response) or overall little modulation (large spatial correlations). I would rather opt for uniform stimuli, as suggested previously. Of course, these are also approximations but can be easily reproduced by different labs and are not subjected to the intricacies of the detailed naturalistic stimulus used.</p>
<p>Fourth. It is important to control the proportion of inhibitory cells activated optogenetically across the recording probe. Currently, it is not possible to assess if there are false negatives. One way of controlling for this would be to show that the number of inhibitory interneurons doesn't vary across the probe.</p>
<p>Fifth. In Fig. 4, the ISI had a minimal bound of 5 ms. Why? This would cap the firing rate at 200Hz, but we know that RGC in explants can fire at higher frequencies for evoked responses. I would set a lower bound since it should come naturally from the after-depolarization block. Another aspect that remains unclear is to what extent the paired-spike ratio depends on the baseline firing rate. This would change the interpretation from the particular synaptic connection to the intrinsic properties of the cell and is plausible since the bassline firing rate varies tremendously. One related analysis would be to plot the change of PSR depending on the ISI. It would be intuitive to make a scatter plot for all paired spikes of all recorded neurons (separated into inhibitory and excitatory) of ISI vs. PSR.</p>
<p>Panel 4E is confusing to me. Here what is plotted is efficacy 1st against PSR (which is efficacy 2nd/efficacy 1st). Given that you have a linear relation between efficacy 1st and efficacy 2nd (panel 4C), you are essentially re-plotting the same information, which should necessarily have a hyperbolic relationship: [ f(x) = y/x ]. Thus, fitting this with a linear function makes no sense and it has to be decaying if efficacy 2nd &gt; efficacy1st as shown in 4C.</p>
<p>Finally, in Figure 5, the perspective is inverted, and the spike correlations are seen from the perspective of SC neurons. Here it would also be good to plot the cumulative histograms and not look at the averages. Regarding the similarity index and use of natural stats, please see my previous comments. Also, would it be possible to plot the contribution v/s the firing rate with the baseline firing rate with no stimulation or full-field stimulation? This is important since naturalistic movies have too many correlations and dependencies that make this plot difficult to interpret.</p>
<p>Overall, the paper only speaks from excitatory and inhibitory differences in the introduction and results. However, it is known that there are three clear morphologically distinct classes of excitatory neurons (wide-field, narrow-field, and stellate). This topic is touched in the discussion but not directly in the context of these results. Smaller cells might likely be driven much stronger. Wide-field cells would likely not be driven by one RGC input only and will probably integrate from many more cells than 6.</p>

<p>This study follows up on a previous study by the group (Sibille et al Nature Communications 2022) in which high density Neuropixel probes were inserted tangentially through the superficial layers of the superior colliculus (SC) to record the activity of retinocollicular axons and postsynaptic collicular neurons in anesthetized mice. By correlating spike patterns, connected pairs could be identified which allowed the authors to demonstrate that functionally similar retinal axon-SC neuron pairs were strongly connected.</p>
<p>In the current study, the authors use similar techniques in vGAT-ChR2 mice and add a fiber optic to identify light-activated GABAergic and non-light-activated nonGABAergic neurons. Using their previously verified techniques to identify connected pairs, within regions of optogenetic activation they identified 214 connected pairs of retinal axons and nonGABAergic neurons and 91 pairs of connected retinal axons and GABAergic neurons. The main conclusion is that retinal activity contributed more to the activity of postsynaptic nonGABAergic SC neurons than to the activity of postsynaptic GABAergic SC neurons.</p>
<p>The study is very well done. The figures are well laid out and clearly establish the conclusions. My main comments are related to the comparison to other circuits and further questions that might be addressed in the SC.</p>
<p>It is stated several times that the superior colliculus and the visual cortex are the two major brain areas for visual processing and these areas are compared throughout the manuscript. However, since both the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN) and SC include similar synaptic motifs, including triadic arrangements of retinal boutons with GABAergic and nonGABAergic neurons, it might be more relevant to compare and contrast retinal convergence and other features in these structures.</p>
<p>The GABAergic and nonGABAergic neurons showed a wide range of firing rates. It might be interesting to sort the cells by firing rates to see if they exhibit different properties. For example, since the SC contains both GABAergic interneurons and projection neurons it would be interesting to examine whether GABAergic neurons with higher firing rates exhibit narrower spikes, similar to cortical fast spiking interneurons. Similarly, it might be of interest to sort the neurons by their receptive field sizes since this is associated with different SC neuron types.</p>
<p>The recording techniques allowed for the identification of the distance between connected retinocollicular fibers and postsynaptic neurons. It might also be interesting to compare the properties of connected pairs recorded at dorsal versus ventral locations since neurons with different genetic identities and response properties are located in different dorsal/ventral locations (e.g. Liu et al. Neuron 2023). Also, regarding the strength of connections, previous electron microscopy studies have shown that the retinocollicular terminals differ in density and size in the dorsal/ventral dimension (e.g Carter et al JCN 1991).</p>
<p>Was optogenetic activation of GABAergic neurons ever paired with visual activation? It would be interesting to examine the receptive fields of the nonGABAergic neurons before and after activation of the GABAergic neurons (as in Gale and Murphy J Neurosci 2016).</p>

<p>This study performs in vivo recordings of neurons in the mouse superior colliculus and their afferents from the retina, retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). Building on a preparation they previously published, this study adds the use of optogenetic identification of inhibitory neurons (aka optotagging) to compare RGC connectivity to excitatory and inhibitory neurons in SC. Using this approach, the authors characterize connection probability, strength, and response correlation between RGCs and their target neurons in SC, finding several differences from what is observed in the retina-thalamus-visual cortex pathway. As such, this may be a useful dataset for efforts to understand retinocollicular connectivity and computations.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p>
<p>We are grateful for the comments from the reviewers, which helped us to strengthen our analyses and communicate more effectively the details of our findings and their significance. To address their criticisms, we have performed new analyses and revised the text and figures. We believe the manuscript was significantly improved. We provide the line number of important    parts of the text that were changed, here in this letter. Below, we address the specific comments from the reviewers in detail.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Gehr and colleagues used an elegant method, using neuropixels probes, to study retinal input integration by mouse superior collicular cells in vivo. Compared to a previous report of the  same group, they opto-tagged inhibitory neurons and defined the differential integration onto each group. Through these experiments, the author concluded that overall, there is no clear difference between the retina connectivity to excitatory and inhibitory superior colliculus   neurons. The exception to that rule is that excitatory neurons might be driven slightly stronger    than inhibitory ones. Technically, this work is performed at a high level, and the plots are beautifully conceived, but I have doubts if the interpretation given by the authors is solid. I will   elaborate below.</p>

<p>My main concern is the &quot;survivor bias&quot; of this work, which can lead to skewed conclusions. From the data set acquired, 305 connections were measured, 1/3 inhibitory and 2/3 excitatory.

This is fundamental since all other conclusions are based on unbiased sampling.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>First of all, we want to thank the reviewer for the detailed and constructive comments based on which we refined the analysis and updated the figures. We hope that our changes adequately address the concerns of reviewer #1.</p>
<p>We would like to clarify that Fig. 2C represents an example from a single experiment. In total, we recorded 326 RGCs and 680 SC neurons in total, with 161 individual RGCs making connections onto 183 individual SC neurons. Moreover, we thank the reviewer for bringing up that important point about the potential “survivor bias”. To address this concern, we would like to provide some clarifications (see below). In addition, we now added the point that different RGCs can have different axonal diameter as requested by the reviewers (line 605).</p>
<p>It is important to note that our approach does not capture the total pool of retinal inputs. Moreover, we did not want to convey the impression that our approach equally captures all retinal inputs to a given SC neuron, as this is not the case. Likewise, it is important to note that our current method does not allow for the measurement of axonal diameters. To obtain an estimate of axonal thickness, complementary techniques such as imaging/staining or electron microscopy would be needed. Our study aimed at characterizing connected RGC-SC pairs and how excitatory and inhibitory neurons in the SC integrate retinal inputs, providing valuable insight on their wiring principles.</p>
<p>We greatly appreciate the reviewer for highlighting this limitation and we now address these points in  the discussion of the revised version of our manuscript (line 603).</p>
<p>Regarding the suggested “rough functional characterization” of the RGCs. We have thought about this analysis and unfortunately, we did not present the necessary stimuli, e.g. chirp, in all experiments to be able to perform this analysis. Moreover, the dataset represented in this work contains only 326 RGC neurons, with 161 identified RGCs making connections to SC neurons. Thus, it is unlikely that our dataset uniformly covers all ~30 RGC types in the mouse. However, given that our dataset is the first measurement of RGC inputs to SC INs and SC EXNs in vivo, we believe it provides a first step and a foundation for future studies focusing on specific RGC types to refine our understanding of the RGC-SC circuitry. We discuss this point now in the revised manuscript (line 586).</p>

<p>One aspect that is not clear to me is to measure of connectivity strength in Figure 2. Here it seems that connectivity strength is directly correlated with the baseline firing rate of the SC neuron (see example plots). If this is a general case, the synaptic strength can be assumed but would only differ in strength due to the excitability of the postsynaptic cell. This should be tested by plotting the correlation coefficient analysis against the baseline firing rate.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the reviewer for bringing up this important point. From the analysis perspective, we would like to clarify that the efficacy measure is independent of the baseline firing rate. It quantifies the probability of adding spikes on top of the baseline rate by subtracting the baseline firing rate before measuring the area of the peak (Usrey et al., 1999).</p>
<p>Furthermore, we acknowledge the reviewer’s interesting and valuable observation about the relationship of the firing rate and the excitability of the SC neuron in the example plots. To test whether the efficacy is directly related to the mean firing rate, we conducted additional analyses to show the efficacy measure as a function of the mean firing rate (Author response image 1 and Figure 2G). To that end, we utilized two different measures of firing rate: the mean firing rate during spontaneous activity (gray screen) over a duration of 10 sec (across 30 trials), which was interleaved with the natural movie presentations, and the overall firing rate throughout the entire recording session. Our findings indeed reveal a positive correlation, as predicted by the reviewer (Author response image 1, gray screen: EXC r = 0.22721; p &lt; 0.00081; INH: r = 0.34677, p= 0.00076; entire recording: EXC r = 0.42685; p &lt; 0.0005; INH: r = 0.43543, p = 0.00002).</p>

</fig>
<p>However, it is important to note that although we observe a correlation on the population level, the relationship between postsynaptic firing and efficacy is diverse. We identify pairs with strong connections despite the firing rate of the postsynaptic SC cell being low. Likewise, we also find pairs with weak connections despite the firing rate of the SC neuron being high (Author response image 2). These observations suggest that factors beyond the postsynaptic firing contribute to the efficacy of the connection. This is exemplified by the fact that SC neurons can receive both strong and weak connections from their convergent presynaptic RGC pool.</p>

<p>In summary, we thank the reviewer for bringing up this important question, and we believe that our additional analyses shed light on the relationship between firing rate and efficacy. This result is very interesting, and we include these findings in the updated Figure 2 in the revised manuscript (panel 2G) in exchange with the panel of the peak latency. Moreover, we also address this point now in the results and discussion section of the revised manuscript (line 280 and line 525).</p>

<p>My third concern is the assessment of functional similarity in Fig. 3. It is not clear to me why the similarity value was taken by the arithmetic mean.

</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for raising this point about the clarification regarding the calculation of the similarity index. We apologize for any confusion caused by our description on the similarity index calculation. To clarify, the similarity index was calculated specifically between the responses of the RGC and the responses of the postsynaptic SC neuron, rather than between the neurons and the visual stimulus. As a result, the similarity index reflects the degree of similarity in the responses of the connected pairs. Therefore, if the responses of the RGC and the connected postsynaptic neuron are identical, regardless of whether they respond exclusively to ON, only to OFF, or a mixture of ON-OFF, the similarity index will be one. We have updated the relevant part in the methods section to make this point clearer to the reader (line 917).</p>

<p>Secondly, correlations in natural(istic) movies can differ dramatically depending on the frame rate that the movie was acquired and the way it is displayed to the animal. What looks natural to us will elicit several artifacts at a retinal level, e.g., due to big jumps between frames (no direction-selective response) or overall little modulation (large spatial correlations). I would rather  opt  for  uniform  stimuli,  as  suggested  previously.  Of  course,  these  are  also approximations but can be easily reproduced by different labs and are not subjected to the intricacies of the detailed naturalistic stimulus used.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the reviewer that spatiotemporal correlations of naturalistic stimuli are complex. To address this point, we added two stimuli with little spatiotemporal correlations to the similarity analysis. The first stimulus we added is a phase scrambled version of the natural movie (PSM, also taken from Froudarakis et al. (2014)). The second is a binary white noise checkerboard stimulus. These stimuli were presented randomly interleaved with the natural movie, for 30 trials each. The similarity index analysis revealed that even with uniform stimuli included, the average similarity index is correlated to the efficacy. We show this data now in Figure 3.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Fourth. It is important to control the proportion of inhibitory cells activated optogenetically across the recording probe. Currently, it is not possible to assess if there are false negatives. One way of controlling for this would be to show that the number of inhibitory interneurons doesn't vary across the probe.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for highlighting this important aspect of the experiment and analysis. We are aware of this point and therefore took extra care to minimize the biases that could be introduced by our recording and stimulation method. Our approach to include recorded excitatory and inhibitory neurons was conservative, briefly:</p>
<p>1. We included only excitatory and inhibitory neurons that were within the SC, defined by visually driven activity and continuous retinotopy (see method).</p>
<p>2. We further restricted the included neurons to neurons that were located within the boundaries of the LED evoked responses, i.e. the recording channels with optogenetic evoked MUA responses within the SC (Figure 1 – figure supplement 1).</p>
<p>3. Both excitatory and inhibitory SC neurons were selected in this way.</p>
<p>These inclusion criteria were specifically designed to avoid sampling excitatory neurons from regions on the Neuropixels probe that lacked optogenetically evoked responses and thus to minimize the number of falsely labeled excitatory neurons.</p>
<p>To illustrate these inclusion criteria and the resulting spatial distribution of the selected excitatory and inhibitory SC neurons along the 384 channels of the Neuropixels probe, we now added a supplementary figure (Figure 1 – figure supplement 1). This figure shows the multi- unit activity in response to optogenetic stimulation and the distribution of inhibitory and excitatory single units within the range of channels that are activated via LED stimulation for 3/11 selected experiments. This highlights that we employed stringent criteria for determining the boundaries and selecting which neurons to include in our study. The distribution of excitatory and inhibitory SC neurons is not significantly different for 9/11 experiments (Wilcoxon rank-sum test, p values = 0.307, 0.0115, 0.755, 0.834, 5.0110-6, 0.79, 0.80, 0.26, 0.33, 0.08, 0.13). Moreover, in the two significantly different experiments only 2 RGC-SC EXC pairs were located in the region without identified SC INs, and thus will not affect the results. We now address this point in the methods section (line 859).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Fifth. In Fig. 4, the ISI had a minimal bound of 5 ms. Why? This would cap the firing rate at 200Hz, but we know that RGC in explants can fire at higher frequencies for evoked responses. I would set a lower bound since it should come naturally from the after-depolarization block.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The chosen 5 ms minimal bound was in the range used in previous literature, e.g. 4-30 ms in Usrey et al. 1998 (Usrey et al., 1998). To address the question of the reviewer, we re-analyzed the data with a lower bound of 2 ms (2 – 30 ms) to include RGCs that fire at higher frequencies than 200Hz. However, we did not observe a clear difference between the 2-30 and 5-30 ms groups for inhibitory connections (SC IN: p = 0.604). Only the excitatory connections show a statistically significant difference (p = 0.011), however, the effect size is small (Cohen’s d = EXC = 0.063, INH = 0.030). Nonetheless we updated a panel in figure 4 to represent the 2-30 ms group (Figure 4F).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Another aspect that remains unclear is to what extent the paired-spike ratio depends on the baseline firing rate. This would change the interpretation from the particular synaptic connection to the intrinsic properties of the cell and is plausible since the bassline firing rate varies tremendously.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>To address how the paired-spike ratio depends on the baseline firing rate we plotted the change of PSR depending on ISI as suggested by the reviewer.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>One related analysis would be to plot the change of PSR depending on the ISI. It would be intuitive to make a scatter plot for all paired spikes of all recorded neurons (separated into inhibitory and excitatory) of ISI vs. PSR.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the valuable suggestion from the reviewer. We have now separated the ISIs into distinct groups spanning 5 ms intervals represented in Author response image 3, right. These intervals range from 5-10 ms up to 25-30 ms. Notably, we observe a difference between the excitatory and inhibitory populations. The excitatory population exhibits a monotonic decrease in mean PSR across the intervals, while the inhibitory population shows a peak around 10/15 ms.</p>

<p>Panel 4E is confusing to me. Here what is plotted is efficacy 1st against PSR (which is efficacy 2nd/efficacy 1st). Given that you have a linear relation between efficacy 1st and efficacy 2nd (panel 4C), you are essentially re-plotting the same information, which should necessarily have a hyperbolic relationship: [ f(x) = y/x ]. Thus, fitting this with a linear function makes no sense and it has to be decaying if efficacy 2nd &gt; efficacy1st as shown in 4C.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for raising this question which helped us to improve the representation and disruption of the results shown in figure 4. Panel 4E is intended to investigate whether there is a correlation between the efficacy strength (eff 1st) and the amount of facilitation (PSR). From panel 4C it is already evident that the data points for high efficacies lie closer to the unity line, as compared to the data points for low efficacies. This suggests that the PSR is stronger for connections with smaller efficacies 1st. To quantify this relationship, we have plotted the efficacy 1st vs the PSR in panel 4E, which thus adds new information to the figure. Importantly, this panel is shown in log-log scales, and therefore the decaying relationship is not evident. If we had shown the data on linear-linear scale, the decaying function would have been evident (Author response image 4). And indeed, as the reviewer pointed out, we cannot fit a hyperbolic relationship with a linear function. This is exactly the reason why we show the data in log-log scale and also estimate the Pearson correlation also from the logs of the efficacies and PSRs.</p>
<p>In Author response image 4 we show the relationship plotted on linear scale using an approach to fit the hyperbolic relationship employing a hyperbolic cosecant function 𝑎/𝑠𝑖𝑛ℎ(𝑏 ∗ 𝑥) + 𝑐.</p>

<p>Overall, the paper only speaks from excitatory and inhibitory differences in the introduction and results. However, it is known that there are three clear morphologically distinct classes of excitatory neurons (wide-field, narrow-field, and stellate). This topic is touched in the discussion but not directly in the context of these results. Smaller cells might likely be driven much stronger. Wide-field cells would likely not be driven by one RGC input only and will probably integrate from many more cells than 6.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for this comment. We agree with the reviewer that addressing how the different excitatory and inhibitory cell-types integrate RGC input is important to understand the visual processing mechanisms in the SC. The presented study aimed at comparing the excitatory and inhibitory population in general using the VGAT-ChR2 mouse line. Understanding how specific genetically defined cell-types integrate RGC inputs is clearly very interesting and should be done. Unfortunately, the mouse lines that would allow targeting genetically identified inhibitory cell-types are still limited and therefore we can only use functional measurements to assess different types of neurons in the SC. We now address this point about distinct SC cell-types in the discussion (line 643).</p>
<p>One possible functional measurement is the size of the receptive field, which, to some degree, could be used as a proxy for different morphologies, i.e. small receptive fields could hint towards compact morphology while large receptive fields could indicate a wider morphology. It is known for example that narrow-field and stellate cells have small RF sizes, while wide-field cells have large RFs. We studied the relationship between the RF size and spike waveform duration but did not find a significant correlation (Figure R6). Moreover, the spike waveform duration, as discussed in the manuscript, is not a valid criterion to separate EXNs and INs in the SC, as it is common practice in the cortex. We now also looked into whether the connectivity strength is related to the RF size. Interestingly, while in the current dataset we do not find a significant correlation between the efficacy and the receptive field size for both EXN and IN (Author response image 5, left), we do find a significant negative correlation between contribution and receptive field size for the excitatory neurons (Author response image5, right). This result indicates that SC excitatory neurons with small receptive fields are more strongly coupled to the RGC input as compared to neurons with larger receptive fields.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>This study follows up on a previous study by the group (Sibille et al Nature Communications 2022) in which high density Neuropixel probes were inserted tangentially through the superficial layers of the superior colliculus (SC) to record the activity of retinocollicular axons and postsynaptic collicular neurons in anesthetized mice. By correlating spike patterns, connected pairs could be identified which allowed the authors to demonstrate that functionally similar retinal axon-SC neuron pairs were strongly connected.</p>
<p>In the current study, the authors use similar techniques in vGAT-ChR2 mice and add a fiber optic to identify light-activated GABAergic and non-light-activated nonGABAergic neurons. Using their previously verified techniques to identify connected pairs, within regions of optogenetic activation they identified 214 connected pairs of retinal axons and nonGABAergic neurons and 91 pairs of connected retinal axons and GABAergic neurons. The main conclusion is that retinal activity contributed more to the activity of postsynaptic nonGABAergic SC neurons than to the activity of postsynaptic GABAergic SC neurons.</p>
<p>The study is very well done. The figures are well laid out and clearly establish the conclusions. My main comments are related to the comparison to other circuits and further questions that might be addressed in the SC.</p>
<p>It is stated several times that the superior colliculus and the visual cortex are the two major brain areas for visual processing and these areas are compared throughout the manuscript. However, since both the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN) and SC include similar synaptic motifs, including triadic arrangements of retinal boutons with GABAergic and nonGABAergic neurons, it might be more relevant to compare and contrast retinal convergence and other features in these structures.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for pointing out that crucial point. Indeed, the comparison to the thalamus is a valid argument, as both the SC and LGN are primary targets of RGC axon terminals. During the preparation of the manuscript, we extensively discussed whether to compare our new SC dataset with existing literature on the LGN or the primary visual cortex (V1) is the more appropriate. Ultimately, we decided on using the visual cortex as the main comparison because of the following reasons:</p>
<p>1. The SC is widely recognized as an evolutionary conserved circuit for visual computation and visually guided behaviors, while the dLGN is generally regarded as a relay station for RGC information to the visual cortex (Steriade, McCormick, 1997). Thus, we believe it is more relevant to compare the evolutionary older visual circuit (SC) to the evolutionary newer visual circuit (visual cortex).</p>
<p>2. In the mouse, the dLGN contains only a limited number of inhibitory interneurons and represent only approximately 6% of the total dLGN neuronal population (Butler, 2008; Evangelio et al., 2018). It has been suggested that the rodent somatosensory thalamus even lacks interneurons (Arcelli et al., 1997). Consequently, directly comparing inhibitory interneurons in the SC to those in the dLGN would pose challenges.</p>
<p>3. Along the same line, the density and also the diversity of inhibitory neurons in the SC is high and likely more comparable to the density and diversity of inhibitory neurons in the visual cortex, than to the dLGN circuit. In the dLGN, TC projection neurons far outnumber inhibitory neurons (Arcelli et al., 1997; Evangelio et al., 2018) and the dLGN is inhabited by just 1-2 classes of GABAergic retinorecipient interneurons (Arcelli et al., 1997; Jaubert-Miazza et al., 2005; Krahe et al., 2011; Ling et al., 2012). Classification approaches (e.g. 3D reconstruction) so far have not revealed any subclasses except for distinctions in intrinsic membrane properties (Leist et al., 2016), suggesting low interneuron diversity in the dLGN. This is in contrast to the vLGN, where a recent study found a diversity of GABAergic neurons (Sabbagh et al., 2021).</p>
<p>4. In the thalamo-cortical circuit, there exists a notable difference in how cortical excitatory and cortical inhibitory neurons are driven by their thalamic input (Alonso and Swadlow, 2005; Cruikshank et al., 2007). This discrepancy forms the basis for several models of visual processing in the visual cortex (Kremkow et al., 2016; Taylor et al., 2021). Which is why we wanted to assess whether the SC follows similar or different rules.</p>
<p>That said, the reviewer is correct that the dLGN and the SC share certain wiring motifs, such as the triadic arrangements of retinal boutons. Unfortunately, the VGAT-ChR2 mouse line used in our study does not specifically label SC inhibitory neurons that are involved in the formation of triadic arrangements. Therefore, we are unable to draw specific conclusion regarding this point. To further investigate this aspect, the usage of GAD67 mice, which have been shown to selectively label intrinsic interneurons which receive RGC input and contact non-GABAergic dendrites (Whyland et al., 2020), would be necessary. Nonetheless, we acknowledge the question raised by the reviewer and in response, we have now provided a more in-depth comparison to the dLGN in the discussion section of the revised manuscript (line 565).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The GABAergic and nonGABAergic neurons showed a wide range of firing rates. It might be interesting to sort the cells by firing rates to see if they exhibit different properties. For example, since the SC contains both GABAergic interneurons and projection neurons it would be interesting to examine whether GABAergic neurons with higher firing rates exhibit narrower spikes, similar to cortical fast spiking interneurons. Similarly, it might be of interest to sort the neurons by their receptive field sizes since this is associated with different SC neuron types.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for the interesting suggestions of SC neurons classification into different categories. The relationship between connectivity measures and RF size has been addressed in Author response image 5. We have now studied the relationship of spike waveforms and several measures such as firing rate and RF size in more detail (Author response image 6).</p>
<p>As the baseline firing is generally low in SC and our experiments are performed under anesthetized conditions, we used the evoked firing rates to sort the cells by firing rates or RF sizes. We have added an analysis showing the mean firing rate (calculated over the full recording duration) as a function of the spike width (peak-to-trough duration). We observe no significant relationship between the different groups of cell types. The same accounts if we sort the SC neurons by their RF size. RF sizes were calculated from PSTHs and summed RF for SL and SD. We do not see a relationship between neuron type and firing or RF size.</p>

<p>The recording techniques allowed for the identification of the distance between connected retinocollicular fibers and postsynaptic neurons. It might also be interesting to compare the properties of connected pairs recorded at dorsal versus ventral locations since neurons with different genetic identities and response properties are located in different dorsal/ventral locations (e.g. Liu et al. Neuron 2023). Also, regarding the strength of connections, previous electron microscopy studies have shown that the retinocollicular terminals differ in density and size in the dorsal/ventral dimension (e.g Carter et al JCN 1991).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for raising this interesting and relevant point to compare the properties of the connected pairs across the dorsal and ventral location. Unfortunately, our tangential recording approach is not ideally suited for comparing the properties of neurons across the different SC depths. For comparing dorsal versus ventral located neurons in the SC, as done in Liu et al., Neuron 2023, vertical recordings would be more appropriate. We now provide a discussion on this aspect (line 589).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Was optogenetic activation of GABAergic neurons ever paired with visual activation? It would be interesting to examine the receptive fields of the nonGABAergic neurons before and after activation of the GABAergic neurons (as in Gale and Murphy J Neurosci 2016).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This is an important point and indeed we have paired activation of GABAergic neurons with visual stimulation (checkerboard stimulus) to assess the impact of the GABAergic neurons on the firing of the excitatory neurons. We observed a diversity of effects, with some EXNs being strongly suppressed and others being only weakly suppressed. Thus, we predict that the receptive field of those EXN that are suppressed by optogenetically evoked IN firing, should be affected in some way. However, the checkerboard stimulus was only presented for a short duration (1 s) and for only a few trials (n = 30). Therefore, estimating the receptive fields of EXN before and after optogenetic activation of GABAergic neurons is unfortunately not possible with the existing dataset.
We now mention this point in the discussion (line 668).</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>This study performs in vivo recordings of neurons in the mouse superior colliculus and their afferents from the retina, retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). Building on a preparation they previously published, this study adds the use of optogenetic identification of inhibitory neurons (aka optotagging) to compare RGC connectivity to excitatory and inhibitory neurons in SC. Using this approach, the authors characterize connection probability, strength, and response correlation between RGCs and their target neurons in SC, finding several differences from what is observed in the retina-thalamus-visual cortex pathway. As such, this may be a useful dataset for efforts to understand retinocollicular connectivity and computations.</p>

<p>I have lost track at this point, but many labs (Heimel, Meister, Farrow, Cang, Isa, maybe others?) have observed that neighboring SC neurons have similar tuning for direction/orientation, but the circuit mechanisms are not well understood. Given the relatively weak correlation between response tuning of RGC axons and their SC target neurons, a useful comparison might be that of SC neurons and their neighbors, and whether SC neurons that show weaker correlation to their RGC axons show stronger correlations with their SC neighbors, which could implicate local connectivity within SC.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for providing this interesting comment. With our recording approach we could study locally connected SC neurons. However, the focus of our study was to first characterize the retinocolliculuar connectivity and therefore investigating the intracollicular connectivity is beyond the scope of the current study. We thank the reviewer for the valuable suggestion and will consider to tackle this aspect in a separate study in the future.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Is it possible any of these measurements are biased by laminar targeting of their probe within superficial SC? Their schematic seems to suggest they targeted the deeper part of superficial SC. Do they know whether they recorded throughout superficial SC or targeted the deeper layers closer to stratum opticum?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Our recordings are in between the deeper and upper visual SC layer depending on the recording site on the Neuropixels probe as we use an angled insertion approach. Besides DiI staining (Author response image 7), we can estimate the location of the probe using functional measurements,
i.e. visually driven channels and retinotopic locations of the recording sites. If the Neuropixels probe is inserted too superficial, the number of recording site with visually driven activity is low. If the Neuropixels probe is inserted too deep in the visual layers we see two separated regions on the probe with visually driven activity in which the retinotopy is non-continues (please refer to Figure 2 in (Sibille et al., 2022)). In the recordings included in this study, the number of visually driven channels was generally high and the retinotopy continues, suggesting that we covered a region within the deeper and upper visual layers.</p>

<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>In Fig. 4, the authors argue that firing in inhibitory neurons is less correlated with RGC input. Does their metric for contribution of retinal input control for the fact that inhibitory neurons have higher firing rates overall and, e.g., may be more depolarized at rest and likelier to fire spontaneous spikes but no less likely to be driven by retina? Or is the argument that their visual responses are more likely to be driven by V1 or local connections?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for bringing up that point. The contribution measure estimates the fraction of SC spikes that were preceded by an RGC spike and it is thus, in theory, independent of the firing rate of the SC neuron. In practice, however, we agree that high firing SC neurons may be more likely to have a lower contribution value simply because a larger fraction of their spikes is not preceded by the activity of the presynaptic RGC. But this is exactly what we aimed at characterizing with this analysis. Where these non-RGC driven SC spikes originate from, whether from a more depolarized state of the neuron or by other sources such as V1 or local connections, we can only speculate about. That said, please note that despite SC INs having higher firing rates, not all of them show low contribution. Likewise, we also see SC neurons with low firing rates and low contribution values (new Supp Fig. 3).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Minor point: The optotagging in the example cell doesn't cause the cell to fire for ~50 ms? That is odd. Typically, cells classified as optotagged fire within 5-10 ms of light onset. Is that a strange example cell or is there something different about the optotagging approach?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Unfortunately, transient LED light onsets and offsets can induce light artifacts on Neuropixels probes (Jun et al., 2017; Steinmetz et al., 2021) and therefore it is challenging to use brief LED pulses for optotagging with Neuropixels probes. To avoid this overlap of artefacts and LED evoked spikes, we opted for a longer stimulus duration of 100 ms to activate VGAT neurons (Bennett et al., 2019; Siegle et al., 2019). Moreover, instead of a square pulse, we used a slow ramping for light onsets and offsets to minimize the magnitude of induced artifacts. In Author response image 8 we present examples of individual activated VGAT neurons responding to a 100 ms blue light pulse.</p>
