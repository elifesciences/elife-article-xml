<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Tissue engineering strategies predominantly rely on the production of living substitutes, whereby implanted cells actively participate in the regenerative process. Beyond cost and delayed graft availability, the patient-specific performance of engineered tissues poses serious concerns on their clinical translation ability. A more exciting paradigm consist in exploiting cell-laid, engineered extracellular matrices (eECM), which can be used as off-the-shelf materials. Here, the regenerative capacity solely relies on the preservation of the eECM structure and embedded signals to instruct an endogenous repair. We recently described the possibility to exploit custom human stem cell lines for eECM manufacturing. In addition to the conferred standardization, the availability of such cell lines opened avenues for the design of tailored eECMs by applying dedicated genetic tools. In this study, we demonstrated the exploitation of CRISPR/Cas9 as a high precision system for editing the composition and function of eECMs. Human mesenchymal stromal/stem cell (hMSC) lines were modified to knockout VEGF and RUNX2 and assessed for their capacity to generate osteoinductive cartilage matrices. We report the successful editing of hMSCs, subsequently leading to targeted VEGF and RUNX2-knockout cartilage eECMs. Despite the absence of VEGF, eECMs retained full capacity to instruct ectopic endochondral ossification. Conversely, RUNX2-edited eECMs exhibited impaired hypertrophy, reduced ectopic ossification and superior cartilage repair in a rat osteochondral defect. In summary, our approach can be harnessed to identify the necessary eECM factors driving endogenous repair. Our work paves the road towards the compositional eECMs editing and their exploitation in broad regenerative contexts.</p>

<title>Summary of Updates:</title>
<fn fn-type="update"><p>1. An ex vivo Chorioallantoic Membrane (CAM) assay was performed, to functionally assess the angiogenic potential of VEGF-edited ECMs. We confirmed the capacity of engineered ECMs to promote vessel formation, in line with ectopic in vivo assessment in mouse. Findings are implemented as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2C</xref>, and as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Supplementary figure 2A</xref>.
2. The regenerative potential of RUNX2-edited ECMs was evaluated in a rat osteochondral defect model. The model was selected in order to assess both the potential of our engineered ECMs to participate in cartilage and/or bone regeneration. In short, our findings demonstrate that RUNX2-edited eECMs significantly enhanced cartilage regeneration. In contrast, the non-edited ECMs -exhibiting clear sign of cartilage hypertrophy- could not promote joint repair in the model. Findings are implemented in an entirely new figure panel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs5">Supplementary Figure 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbls1">supplementary Table 1</xref>.
In addition, beyond the suggested functional validation of our eECMs we have also compiled new data reinforcing our previous claim. This is now implemented as:
- <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>: Immunofluorescence stainings of engineered cartilage ECMs generated by the MSOD-B and MSOD-BΔV1 lines, respectively. These stainings confirmed strong content in collagen type I and collagen type X in the tissues, while vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is poorly detectable in the edited MSOD-BΔV1 ECMs.
- <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I</xref>: A 2D osteogenic differentiation assessment of the MSOD-B and MSOD-BΔR1 cells was
performed in vitro. We could confirm the functional impact of RUNX2 knock-down on the osteogenic
potential of MSOD-BΔR1 cells, as no mineralized matrix was deposited by the cells.
- <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3J</xref>: We implemented a gene expression profile analysis of MSOD-B and MSOD-BΔR1,
stimulated or not with pro-osteogenic medium for three weeks. In line, with the results presented in
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I</xref>, we could confirm an impairment in the expression of key osteoblastic-associated genes
(RUNX2, COLX, ALPL) in MSOD-BΔR1 cells.</p></fn>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Extracellular matrices (ECMs) are complex networks of proteins providing tissue structural and mechanical support, but also acting as growth factor storing and presenting entities<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. As such, ECMs are receiving increasing attention in tissue engineering as templates capable of guiding homeostasis, remodeling, and regenerative processes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>ECMs can be derived from native tissue or organs (native ECMs, nECMs) by applying a decellularization step which effectively removes the cellular fraction. The resulting nECMs are commonly used as biomaterials in regenerative medicine<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>, offering a natural biocompatible structure. However, they suffer from substantial batch-to-batch variation with their properties being largely affected by the tissue source and the decellularization process<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. Importantly, while displaying a high level of biological complexity and fidelity, the composition of nECMs cannot be tailored to specific needs.</p>
<p>A valuable option emerged from recent advances in bioengineering which led to the development of synthetic ECMs (sECMs). These tunable materials are predominantly composed of biopolymers such as poly (lactic acid) (PLA), poly (glycolic acid) (PGA), poly (lactic co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) and Poly (ethylene glycol) (PEG), which can be functionalized with bioactive substances such as peptides, growth factors or enzymes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>,</sup>. The possible modulation of sECM’s composition and chemistry offers precise control over their mechanical properties, degradability, and temporal release of instructive molecules towards improved tissue repair. Despite holding great promises, yet their structure and function remain simplified compared to their native counterpart <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>With the aim of combining high biological fidelity and design flexibility, engineered ECMs (eECMs) have become a credible alternative. Those result from the exploitation of stem/progenitor populations capable of depositing ECMs under specific in vitro culture conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>, which can be subsequently isolated from the cellular fraction and exploited as a cell-laid product. Early studies were conducted using eECM derived from primary cells, exhibiting variable performance associated with the inter-donor variability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Most recently, we demonstrated the possibility to standardize the production of eECMs through the engineering of dedicated human mesenchymal stromal/stem cell (hMSC) lines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. Precisely, the Mesenchymal Sword of Damocles – BMP2 (MSOD-B) line offered the generation of eECMs in the form of human cartilage templates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. Those cartilage templates can be further devitalized, lyophilized, and stored as an <italic>off-the-shelf</italic> tissue, retaining remarkable bone formation capacity by instructing endochondral ossification<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>The exploitation of cell lines as an unlimited cell source for eECM generation offers unprecedented standardization in graft production and performance. Meanwhile, it also consists of a robust cellular platform facilitating their further genetic engineering, to achieve the production of eECMs tailored in composition and function. Towards this objective, CRISPR/Cas9 appears as a versatile and efficient gene-editing tool. While this technology has been extensively used for genetic screening or disease modeling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>, the possibility to edit hMSCs and study the compositional impact on deposited eECMs has not been investigated so far.</p>
<p>In this study, we aim at demonstrating that CRISPR/Cas9 can be applied as an editing tool for the engineering of custom eECMs. As proof-of-principle, our strategy relies on the CRISPR/Cas9-guided editing of the MSOD-B line for knocking out Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and Runt related transcription factor 2 (RUNX2), respectively a key pro-angiogenic protein and transcription factor critically involved in the endochondral ossification pathway. The resulting hMSC lines will be evaluated for their capacity to generate hypertrophic cartilage in vitro and instruct tailored skeletal tissue formation in vivo as cell-free and lyophilized templates. If successful, our study is expected to validate the use of CRISPR/Cas9 for eECMs edited in composition, while providing a novel platform towards decoding the necessary molecular signals driving effective tissue repair.</p>

<title>CRISPR/Cas9 editing of hMSC lines lead to efficient VEGF knockout in cartilage tissues</title>
<p>VEGF is a known master regulator of angiogenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup> and a key mediator of endochondral ossification. When reaching hypertrophy, chondrocytes highly express VEGF, prompting vasculature invasion and subsequent osteoprogenitor recruitment. This was proven to be essential for cartilage template remodeling into bone and bone marrow<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>. Here, we thus first aimed at engineering a hMSC line CRISPR/Cas9-edited for VEGF knockout and evaluate the corresponding impact on cartilage and endochondral bone formation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). To this end, specific guide RNAs (gRNAs) targeting different regions of the VEGF gene but conserved across all isoforms of VEGF were designed based on a previously established protocol<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>. Three gRNAs targeting exon 1 (VEGF_1.1, VEGF_1,2, VEGF1.3), one targeting exon 2 (VEGF_2.1), and one targeting exon 8 (VEGF_8.1) were designed (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Supplementary Figure 1A</xref>). These gRNAs were cloned into the pU6-(BbsI)_CBh-Cas9-T2A-mCherry vector encoding the Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 (SpCas9) machinery. Following transfection in MSOD-B cells, single cell clones were sorted based on the transient mCherry expression and expanded for characterization (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). Out of 163 single clones, 14 could be successfully expanded (8.5 %). From these clones, five were retrieved from the gRNA 1.1, six from gRNA 1.3 and three from gRNA 8.1. In order to assess a successful editing and directly correlate it to a knockout of VEGF, an ELISA assay was performed to measure the concentration of VEGF in the supernatant of expanded MSOD-B clones (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). In non-edited cells (MSOD-B, control), 5000 pg/mL were secreted and detected by ELISA. From the successfully expanded clones, most of them showed reduced but non-abolished secretion of VEGF. However, two clones exhibited undetectable levels of VEGF, both resulting from the gRNA targeting the Exon1 of the VEGF gene. These clones were defined as MSOD-BΔV1 and MSOD-BΔV2 and further characterized for their capacity to form cartilage.</p>

<p>A) Experimental scheme depicting the generation of CRISPR/Cas9-edited MSOD-B lines, and the subsequent in vitro and in vivo tissue formation assessment. B) Overview of the native human VEGF coding sequence composed of eight exons. Designed gRNAs and their targeted binding sites are illustrated, as well as the corresponding expected impact on the coding sequence. gRNAs targeting exon 1 (orange) disrupt translation initiation and inhibit protein expression, gRNA targeting exon 2 (blue) disrupts VEGF receptor binding, and gRNA targeting exon 8 (green) alters the C-Terminal sequence and repress activation of protein. C) ELISA-based quantitative analysis of VEGF protein content in cell culture supernatant from expanded single cell colonies. From all clones, only two had no detectable level of VEGF (1.3_3 and 1.3_6). These clones were subsequently defined as MSOD-B1Wl and MSOD-B1W2. D) Histological assessment of in vitro differentiated constructs using Safranin O (top panel) and Masson’s trichrome (bottom panel) stains. Both the MSOD-B and MSOD-B1Wl displayed glycosaminoglycans (GAG) (orange to reddish in Safranin 0) and collagen content (Blueish in Masson’s trichrome), indicating successful cartilage formation (Scale bars= 200 µm). Left bottom inserts show the whole tissue section. E) Quantitative assessment of the total GAG content in MSOD-B and MSOD-B1Wl in vitro differentiated constructs. Unpaired t-test, n = 3 biological replicates, n.s. = not significant. F) ELISA-based quantitative assessment of VEGF protein in in vitro differentiated constructs. Unpaired t­ test, n = 3-4 biological replicates, ****p &lt; 0.0001. G) lmmunofluorescence images of MSOD-B and MSOD-BLI.Vl tissues. Displayed images consist of 3D-stacks from 80-100 µm thick sections, stained for VEGF (yellow), Collagen Type X (COLX, red) and Collagen Type I (COLl, grey). A clear reduction in the VEGF signal could be observed in the MSOD-BL\.Vl tissues, indicating a successful VEGF knockdown (Scale bars= 80 µm).</p></caption>

</fig>
<p>To this end, clones were expanded and seeded on collagen scaffold and induced for three weeks towards chondrogenic differentiation. As anticipated with the MSOD-B tissues, histological assessment revealed the formation of a collagenous matrix (Masson’s Trichrome) with cartilage features (Safranin-O, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>). Similarly, a successful chondrogenic differentiation and deposition of glycosaminoglycans could be observed in the MSOD-BΔV1 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>) constructs. A quantitative assessment (blyscan assay) confirmed the comparable content in glycosaminoglycans in MSOD-B and VEGF-edited clones (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>). Importantly, VEGF quantification in corresponding pellets validated the successful knockout of the protein, barely detectable in the MSOD-BΔV1 and ΔV2 tissues (47.64 pg/pellet in edited clones versus 552.7 pg/pellet in MSOD-B, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>).</p>
<p>To further examine the potential impact of VEGF-editing on tissue formation, we performed immunostaining analysis of the engineered cartilages. Confocal microscopy revealed strong deposition of Collagen Type I (COL1) and Collagen Type X (COLX) in all samples, characteristic of mature hypertrophic cartilage tissues (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G</xref>). However, while the immunostaining revealed the VEGF deposition in the MSOD-B ECM, the protein could not be detected in the MSOD-BΔV1 samples (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G</xref>).</p>
<p>Taken together, this data indicates the successful generation of MSOD-B lines knocked-out in VEGF. The MSOD-BΔV1 clones exhibited frank cartilage formation capacity with minimal level of VEGF. This validates the use of CRISPR/Cas9 as a precision tool to edit the composition of cartilage tissue.</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<title>VEGF knockout cartilage tissues retain bone remodeling capacity despite reduced early-stage vascularization</title>
<p>To evaluate the functional impact of VEGF knockout in engineered constructs, we assessed both the angiogenic and bone formation assays. Since the two clones exhibited similar in vitro tissue formation capacity, only the MSOD-BΔV1 was selected for further performance assessment.</p>
<p>We first performed the Chorioallantoic Membrane (CAM) assay as ex vivo assessment of angiogenic potential (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). This assay provides insights into the biological activity and neovascularization potential of each construct, through quantitative evaluation of vascular density around engineered grafts After 4 days, we observed an extensive vessel formation in the periphery of both MSOD-B and MSOD-BΔV1 eECMs (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). Quantification of vascular densities <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup> suggested a reduced vessel formation in MSOD-BΔV1 samples but without reaching significance (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Supplementary Figure 2A</xref>). Thus, the CAM assay indicated that both MSOD-B and MSOD-BΔV1 cartilages retain angiogenic potentials.</p>

<p>We next investigate in vivo the impact of the VEGF knockout on the graft capacity to undergo endochondral ossification, by implanting cartilage grafts subcutaneously in an immunodeficient mouse model. Importantly, prior to implantation, tissues were lyophilized using a pre-established protocol<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. This allowed us to assess the performance of the generated tissue itself, in line with the idea of developing off-the-shelf substitutes. Samples were extracted after two and six weeks as early and late development timepoints (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>). After two weeks in vivo, we first evaluated the angiogenic potential of tissues by quantitative confocal microscopy imaging of 100 µm thick sections stained for CD31, a well-defined vascular marker. This allowed us to evidence a dense vascular network in MSOD-B constructs, covering the entirety of the grafts (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>). Instead, MSOD-BΔV1 displayed a more limited vascularization, pre-dominantly at the tissue periphery (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>). Quantification confirmed these observations with MSOD-B exhibiting a significantly higher volume of vessels per total section volume (0.523 µm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup> versus 0.231 µm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup> for MSOD-B and MSOD-BΔV1 respectively, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>).</p>
<p>Using microtomography, we further assessed the amount of mineralized tissue formed in a temporal fashion. At two weeks, the formation of a cortical ring could already be observed in both MSOD-B and MSOD-BΔV1 tissues (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2G</xref>). Quantifications revealed a similar bone/mineralized volume normalized to the total volume of the graft (BV/TV, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2H</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">supplementary figure 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">2D</xref>) with 17 % and 16 % in MSOD-B and MSOD-BΔV1 samples respectively. At the six-week timepoint, trabecular structures could be observed in reconstructed 3D scans from both groups (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2G</xref>). Remarkably, histological analysis confirmed the similar development of the tissues with frank bone formation (Massońs trichrome) already at two weeks post-implantation and minimal remnants of cartilage (Safranin O) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2I</xref>). At six weeks both samples remodeled into fully mature bone organs, characterized by presence of cortical and trabecular structures as well as a bone marrow tissue filling the cavity (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2I</xref>).</p>
<p>These results indicate that the absence of VEGF in cartilage tissue can delay the early vascularization of MSOD-BΔV samples. However, this did not prevent nor impact the remodeling of the lyophilized grafts into bone and bone marrow tissues indicating that VEGF is non-essential in order to efficiently instruct endochondral ossification.</p>

<p>One gRNA was designed for targeting exon 2 (RUNX2_2.1), one targeting exon 5 (RUNX2_5.1), two targeting exon 6 (RUNX2_6.1 and RUNX2_6.2) and one targeting exon 8 (RUNX2_8.1). Similar to the VEGF set-up, gRNAs were transfected in MSOD-B cells together with a pU6-(BbsI)_CBh-Cas9-T2A-mCherry plasmid to ensure transfection efficiency and single cell sorting of positive clones. Out of 385 single clones, 62 could be successfully expanded, corresponding to a 16.1% efficiency. From these clones, five were derived from the RUNX2_5.1 gRNA, 18 from RUNX2_6.1, 15 from RUNX26.2 and 24 from RUNX2_8.1.</p>
<p>To identify successfully edited clones, we first screened for those exhibiting a decrease in their RUNX2 protein expression using intra cellular flow cytometry. Among the 62 clones, 17 displayed a reduced RUNX2 pattern as compared to the MSOD-B control (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">Supplementary Figure 3B</xref>) and were further sent for sequencing analysis. This led to the identification of two successfully edited clones, demonstrating a point mutation in the exon 6 of RUNX2 gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">Supplementary Figure 3C</xref>). To confirm the knockout impact on the transcription factor structure, a Western Blot analysis was conducted on cellular extracts of in vitro cultured cells. MSOD-B cells exhibited intact RUNX2 proteins of 52 – 62 kDa<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>(<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>). Instead, the RUNX2-edited cells displayed truncated versions of 32 – 42 kDa, consistent with the expected mRNA shortening.</p>
<p>These two clones were defined as MSOD-BΔR1 and MSOD-BΔR2 and further assessed for their ability to form cartilage in vitro. Following 3D chondrogenic differentiation, samples were processed for histological analysis. The presence of cartilage structures embedded in a rich collagenous matrix could be observed in all MSOD-B, MSOD-BΔR2 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>) and MSOD-BΔR1 tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">Supplementary Figure 3D</xref>). Quantification of glycosaminoglycans revealed a similar content in all the groups (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">Supplementary Figure 3E</xref>). Using immunostaining combined with quantitative confocal microscopy, the possible impact of RUNX2-editing on tissue hypertrophy was further investigated. First, Collagen Type II (COL2) staining confirmed the similar distribution of cartilage matrix across MSOD-B, MSOD-BΔR1 and MSOD-BΔR2 samples (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">Supplementary Figure 3F</xref>). However, we observed a clear distinction in the Collagen Type X (COLX) expression pattern, a specific marker of hypertrophy which was hardly detectable in MSOD-BΔR tissues (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">Supplementary Figure 3F</xref>). Subsequent quantification confirmed a significant reduction of COLX volume in MSOD-BΔR1 (0.236 µm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>) and MSOD-BΔR2 (0.182 µm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>) compared to MSOD-B (0.81 µm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3G</xref>, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3H</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">Supplementary figure 3G-H-I</xref>).</p>
<p>To further characterize the functional impact of the RUNX2 knock-down, the MSOD-B and MSOD-BΔR1 osteogenic differentiation capacity was assessed in vitro. After 3 weeks of culture in osteogenic medium (or expansion medium, control), Alizarin Red staining revealed a s a marked absence of mineralization in MSOD-BΔR1 culture, while in stark contrast with MSOD-B cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3I</xref>). Quantitative PCR analysis indicated a lower expression of COLX and ALPL in MSOD-BΔR1 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3J</xref>), key osteogenic-associated genes, of interest, the expression level of RUNX2 was only partially decreased in MSOD-BΔR1, in line with the truncated mRNA reducing but not abrogating qPCR primers binding probability.</p>
<p>In summary, we here report the successful RUNX2 knockout in MSOD-B lines using CRISPR/Cas9. RUNX2 did not impair chondrogenesis but prevented the tissue hypertrophy, as well as the osteogenic potential of the cells.</p>

From microtomography image reconstructions, we observed an evident reduction of mineralization in MSOD-BΔR1 compared to MSOD-B (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>) already after two weeks. This qualitative and visual difference in mineralization persisted after six weeks in vivo (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>).

<p>Following explantation, histological stainings and micro-tomography were performed on all sample groups. Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&amp;E) and Masson’s Trichrome indicated de novo bone formation in the defect area for both the MSOD-B and MSOD-BΔR1 groups (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs5">supplementary figure 5B</xref>). The presence of fibrotic tissue as well as a reduced marrow compartment suggested an incomplete remodeling at that timepoint (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>). Upon Tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) staining, we observed elevated level osteoclastic activities in MSOD-B samples compared to MSOD-BΔR1 indicating reduced rate of active bone formation in MSOD-BΔR1 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>). The micro-CT quantification revealed a 30% repair of the damaged bone in the defect for both MSOD-B and MSOD-BΔR1 groups (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs5">Supplementary figure 5C</xref>). Of interest, a significantly higher trabecular separation was observed in MSOD-B and MSOD-BΔR1, confirming an ongoing bone remodeling process (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref>).</p>
<p>While no statistical differences in bone formation could be identified between the two groups, the MSOD-BΔR1 tissue led to a superior regeneration of the cartilage area, as revealed by Safranin-O staining (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5F</xref>) in the chondral zone (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5F</xref>, a,b and c magnification).

<p>Quantification of cartilage tissue within condyle surface area confirmed a poor-to-no repair in the MSOD-B group (1.05%, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5G</xref>). In sharp contrast, the MSOD-BΔR1 implanted eECMs initiated a chondral regeneration reaching approximately 20.67% of the total healthy cartilage area. The integration and regeneration potential of engineered constructs was further evaluated by performing a semi-quantitative histological assessment following a pre-existing grading system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbls1">Supplementary table 1</xref>). This approach allows for the systematic evaluation of critical repair tissue parameters, offering a comparative measure of the regenerative efficacy of the engineered constructs against healthy tissue benchmarks. In the assessment of stained femur condyle sections, cellular morphology and matrix staining of the MSOD-BΔR1 group (66% and 50%, respectively) were significantly better compared to the MSOD-B one (33% and 16%, respectively). Although both constructs exhibited reduced cartilage thickness and subchondral bone regeneration, MSOD-BΔR1 consistently outperformed the MSOD-B grafts (33.33% versus 8.33% and 25% versus 16.66%). Surface regularity and integration with adjacent cartilage also revealed better outcomes in MSOD-BΔR1 (41% and 50%) as opposed to MSOD-B (50% and 33%), further indicating an enhanced regenerative potential of the MSOD-BΔR1 constructs.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We here report the possibility to edit the composition and function of eECM by CRISPR/Cas9 engineering of human mesenchymal lines. VEGF knockout led to successful in vitro formation of cartilage with targeted protein depletion. Upon implantation, this impacted the graft vascularization onset but not the endogenous instruction of the endochondral program. In turn, RUNX2 knockout prevented cartilage hypertrophy in vitro, significantly delaying ectopic bone and bone marrow formation in vivo. This strategy was validated in a functional osteochondral defect model, whereby prevention of cartilage hypertrophy by RUNX2 deletion led to superior cartilage regeneration.</p>
<p>A clear interdependency of angiogenesis and osteogenesis occurs upon bone formation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>. For this reason, VEGF-enrichment has been naturally proposed as a strategy to accelerate or increase bone graft vascularization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>. Our study demonstrates that VEGF knocked-out cartilage templates retained full osteoinductive potential in a challenging ectopic environment. Those results are in sharp contrast with intramembranous strategies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>, including our previous work<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>, whereby grafts remain insufficient in promoting complete bone remodeling even upon VEGF-enrichment. This suggests that the first stage of host progenitor recruitment by our eECM is not VEGF dependent, although subsequent tissue vascularization and remodeling may be orchestrated in a second step by endogenous cell secretion. Other pro-angiogenic proteins embedded in the matrix may also have compensated for the lack of VEGF, such as BMP-2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup> known to stimulate endothelial cell proliferation, migration, and differentiation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup> <sup>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Conversely, RUNX2 deletion was shown to fully prevent cartilage hypertrophy, in line with published mouse models also reporting a lack of endochondral ossification and lethality at birth upon RUNX2 knockout<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup>. Here, MSOD-BΔR cartilage templates still exhibited frank bone formation capacity, but with cortical and trabecular structures largely reduced as compared to controls. Future work may clarify if this strictly results from the absence of COLX, or if an additional specific cartilage matrix component (e.g. matrix metalloproteinases) impaired the instruction of endochondral ossification.</p>
<p>The performance in a regenerative context was further evaluated in a rat osteochondral defect model<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup>. We defined an early timepoint of 3-week as providing the opportunity to assess the early contribution of the grafts to both the cartilage and bone tissue regeneration. Strikingly, only the MSOD-BΔR could contribute to a superior chondrogenesis. We hypothesize that the absence of hypertrophic features prevented the template degradation and favored its integration to native cartilage. Despite the repair performance being limited to an approximate 20% of native cartilage restoration, this is remarkable in light of the BMP-2 content in our ECM prompting endochondral ossification <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup>. In fact, preventing the in vivo remodeling of engineered cartilage templates remains challenging in the skeletal regeneration field, with bone marrow MSCs (BM-MSCs) cartilage systematically reaching hypertrophy and subsequent ossification. Our results warrant further studies comprising additional timepoints to decipher the repair dynamic, as well as the long-term stability of newly formed tissue. It also prompts a comparison with other recently proposed <italic>off-the-shelf</italic> strategies, based on ECM<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup> or synthetic scaffold materials<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup>, in order to comprehend the feasibility to exploit our grafts for stable cartilage / joint repair<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref></sup>. Taken together, while the relevance of CRISPR/Cas9 eECMs in cartilage repair remains to be further validated, our study demonstrates the relevance of genetically-edited ECMs in regenerative contexts.</p>
<p>CRISPR/Cas9 editing of human mesenchymal cells has previously been explored for gene and cell therapy applications<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref></sup>, for tailoring the immunomodulatory and/or differentiation capacity of engineered cells. However, no studies have described the exploitation of editing strategies for the generation of eECMs, whereby modified cells are absent from the final grafting product. Our work illustrate that this can be achieved by direct targeting of secreted factors typically embedded upon ECM deposition, as demonstrated with VEGF. Alternatively, we also propose the knockout of key transcription factors as a strategy for custom eECM generation by impacting their tissue developmental/maturation stages.</p>
<p>A clear implication of our work lies in the possibility to decipher the necessary factors capable of instructing de novo tissue formation. Those findings will be of high relevance for the design of eECMs tailored in composition. Beyond bone repair, our study also bears high relevance in other regenerative contexts. In fact, an exciting opportunity also lies in harnessing CRISPR/Cas9 for editing eECMs and tuned their immunogenicity. Key inflammatory components could be turned down, leading to improved efficacy of repair in line with the immuno-engineering principles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Importantly, our study describes the exploitation of eECMs in a lyophilized form, thus conferring an off-the-shelf storage solution. Together with the standardization of production conferred by stable cell sources, our concept offers exciting translational opportunities. In fact, instrumental to this work is the use of dedicated hMSC lines. The genetic modification of primary cells is laborious, and their limited lifespan ex vivo challenges their selection, characterization, and exploitation for tissue engineering applications<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref></sup>. Here, the MSOD-B was harnessed as an unlimited cell source with robust differentiation potential. Nonetheless, the editing of eECMs remains tedious in part due to the limited CRISPR/Cas9 efficiency and potential off-target effects, calling for a systematic clonal selection. In addition, while large CRISPR/Cas9 screening can be performed in other stem cell systems<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref></sup>, the critical cell mass required for effective cartilage formation affects parallelization and leads to limited throughput. Nonetheless, after the identification and characterization process, the resulting cell lines can be banked and used for unlimited tissue manufacturing.</p>
<p>The MSOD-B line remains the only human cell source capable of priming endochondral ossification by engineering living or cell-free grafts. This was demonstrated to be driven by the combined low dose of BMP-2 embedded in the tissue (∼40 ng/tissue) together with glycosaminoglycans and other thousands of identified ECM proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. The BMP-2 amount is thus far below the typical amount used in sECMs approaches for effective osteoinduction, falling in the microgram to milligram range<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. This is one key advantage of eECM graft, exhibiting a biological complexity that so far has not been matched by sECMs. Ideally, the two approaches are complementary as the editing of eECMs could inform on the necessary but sufficient factors driving effective regeneration. Those would in turn be embedded in a sECMs strategy and offer a fast and possibly cost-effective solution.</p>
<p>To conclude, the present work offers a platform for decoding factors involved in tissue regeneration and generate tailored eECM. Here, illustrated in the context of skeletal repair, our study may offer similar opportunities in other regenerative situations.</p>

<title>Rat osteochondral defect model</title>
<p>Ten- to 12-week-old male Sprague Dawley rats (n=11) were purchased from JANVIER LABS (France). After 7 days of acclimation the rats were anesthetized using 3% isoflurane. Then, animals were placed on a 37°C warm heating pad in prone position. Once anesthetized, isoflurane was lowered to 2 to 2.5%, and buprenorphine (Temgesic, 30 μg/kg; Indivior Europe Ltd., Dublin, Ireland) was injected subcutaneously for analgesia. The right hind limb of the animal was shaved and carefully disinfected, and an incision was made along the skin and soft tissue to expose the right knee. After cleaning the knee laterally from soft tissue, patella was displaced laterally to expose the distal femur. An articular cartilage defect with 2mm depth and 1mm diameter was created at the trochlear groove of femur. The defect was then push-fitted with the grafts, and not secured with any sutures. The wound was closed in a layered fashion using resorbable sutures (Vicryl 45-0, Ethicon, Somerville, USA) by closing the joint capsule, followed by the muscle tissue (continuous interlaced suture), followed by closing the skin (Donati suture). Animals started load bearing immediately after surgery. After 3 weeks (n=11) animals were anesthetized by isoflurane inhalation (3%), followed by CO2 asphyxiation, and right-femur were harvested prior to subsequent micro-CT and histological characterization.</p>

<title>Histology grading method</title>
<p>Histological sections from rat femur condyles were stained with Safranin-O, Masson’s trichrome, and H&amp;E staining. A semi-quantitative analysis of the repaired tissue was performed by utilizing a customized adaptation of the histological grading system initially outlined by Wakitani et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref></sup>. This modified scale encompasses six distinct parameters: cellular morphology, matrix staining, surface regularity, cartilage thickness, regenerated subchondral bone formation, and integration with neighbouring cartilage. Each parameter was graded on a numerical scale ranging from 0 to 4 points by independent expert observers, where a maximum total score of 16 indicates the presence of tissue displaying characteristics akin to entirely healthy and normal tissue (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<sec id="s4r">
<title>Cartilage quantification method</title>
<p>An evaluation of three distinct sites within the condyle defect was conducted to ascertain the proportion of cartilage in each knee. Utilizing the measured femoral condyle thickness (200μm) and defect length (1mm), a standardized Region of Interest (ROI) was defined using ImageJ. The percentage of cartilage-positive regions within each defect was calculated in relation to the total ROI size, offering a quantitative assessment of cartilage regeneration. This identical approach was applied to evaluate the percentage of cartilage in the healthy control samples.</p>

<title>Vascular density quantification</title>
<p>To assess vascular density, the Quantitative Vascular Analysis Tool (Q-VAT)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup> was utilized. The samples were placed inside the chicken egg for CAM assay, and the images were acquired using a digital microscope. These images were then segmented into tiles for detailed analysis. The binary vascular masks were generated using the Q-VAT’s automated capabilities, to distinguish vascular structures within the tissue. The tool then facilitated the separation of vessel measurements based on their diameters, allowing for a differentiated quantification of macro- and microvasculature. These binary masks were then processed to calculate the vascular density, which refers to the proportion of the tissue area occupied by vessels. This quantitative metric was evaluated for each tile, and the mean vascular density was computed across all tiles for each tissue sample. As part of the analysis, we applied Q-VAT to double or triple-stained slides to quantify the overlapping percentage of vessels, comparing various time points to observe changes over the course of the experiment.</p>

<p>The study presents a potentially <bold>useful</bold> approach to genetically modify cells to produce extracellular matrices with altered compositions. The evidence supporting the authors' conclusions regarding the chondrogenicity of lyophilized constructs is considered <bold>incomplete</bold>, as the study does not adequately demonstrate the formation of a histologically identifiable cartilaginous matrix. The study also lacks several significant details and does not have sufficient power to support the conclusions.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors aimed to modify the characteristics of the extracellular matrix (ECM) produced by immortalized mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) by employing the CRISPR/Cas9 system to knock out specific genes. Initially, they established VEGF-KO cell lines, demonstrating that these cells retained chondrogenic and angiogenic properties.

<p>Subsequently, the authors established RUNX2-KO cell lines, which exhibited reduced COLX expression during chondrogenic differentiation and notably diminished osteogenic properties in vitro.

<p>The manuscript submitted by Sujeethkumar et al. describes an alternative approach to skeletal tissue repair using extracellular matrix (ECM) deposited by genetically modified mesenchymal stromal/stem cells. Here, they generate a loss of function mutations in VEGF or RUNX2 in a BMP2-overexpressing MSC line and define the differences in the resulting tissue-engineered constructs following seeding onto a type I collagen matrix in vitro, and following lyophilization and subcutaneous and orthotopic implantation into mice and rats. Some strengths of this manuscript are the establishment of a platform by which modifications in cell-derived ECM can be evaluated both in vitro and in vivo, the demonstration that genetic modification of cells results in complexity of in vitro cell-derived ECM that elicits quantifiable results, and the admirable goal to improve endogenous cartilage repair. However, I recommend the authors clarify their conclusions and add more information regarding reproducibility, which was one limitation of primary-cell-derived ECMs.</p>
<p>Overcoming the limitations of native/autologous/allogeneic ECMs such as complete decellularization and reduction of batch-to-batch variability was not specifically addressed in the data provided herein. For the maintenance of ECM organization and complexity following lyophilization, evidence of complete decellularization was not addressed, but could be easily evaluated using polarized light microscopy and quantification of human DNA for example in constructs pre and post-lyophilization. It would be ideal to see minimization of batch-to-batch variability using this approach, as mitigation of using a sole cell line is likely not sufficient (considering that the sole cell line-derived Matrigel does exhibit batch-to-batch and manufacturer-to-manufacturer variability).</p>
<p>I recommend adding details regarding experimental design and outcomes not initially considered. Inter- and intra-experimental reproducibility was not adequately addressed. The size of in vitro-derived cartilage pellets was not quantified, and it is not clear that more than one independent 'differentiation' was performed from each gene-edited MSC line to generate in vitro replicates and constructs that were implanted in vivo.</p>
<p>The use of descriptive language in describing conclusions may mislead the reader and should be modified accordingly throughout the manuscript. For example, although this reviewer agrees with the comparative statements made by the authors regarding parental and gene-edited MSC lines, non-quantifiable terms such as 'frank' 'superior' (example, line 242) are inappropriate and should rather be discussed in terms of significance. Another example is 'rich-collagenous matrix,' which was not substantiated by uniform immunostaining for type II collagen (line 189).</p>
<p>I have similar recommendations regarding conclusive statements from the rat implantation model, which was appropriately used for the purpose of evaluating the response of native skeletal cells to the different cell-derived ECMs. Interpretations of these results should be described with more accuracy. For example, increased TRAP staining does not indicate reduced active bone formation (line 237). Many would not conclude that GAGs were retained in the RUNX2-KO line graft subchondral region based on the histology. Quantification of % chondral regeneration using histology is not accurate as it is greatly influenced by the location in the defect from which the section was taken. Chondral regeneration is usually semi-quantified from gross observations of the cartilage surface immediately following excision. The statements regarding integration (example line 290) are not founded by histological evidence, which should show high magnification of the periphery of the graft adjacent to the native tissue.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this study, the authors have started off using an immortalized human cell line and then gene-edited it to decrease the levels of VEGF1 (in order to influence vascularization), and the levels of Runx2 (to decrease chondro/osteogenesis). They first transplanted these cells with a collagen scaffold. The modified cells showed a decrease in vascularization when VEGF1 was decreased, and suggested an increase in cartilage formation.</p>
<p>In another study, the matrix generated by these cells was subsequently remodeled into a bone marrow organ. When RUNX2 was decreased, the cells did not mineralize in vitro, and their matrices expressed types I and II collagen but not type X collagen in vitro, in comparison with unedited cells. In vivo, the author claims that remodeling of the matrices into bone was somewhat inhibited. Lastly, they utilized matrices generated by RUNX2 edited cells to regenerate chondro-osteal defects. They suggest that the edited cells regenerated cartilage in comparison with unedited cells.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>-The notion that inducing changes in the ECM by genetically editing the cells is a novel one, as it has long been thought that ECM composition influences cell activity.</p>
<p>-If successful, it may be possible to make off-the-shelf ECMS to carry out different types of tissue repair.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>-The authors have not generated histologically identifiable cartilage or bone in their transplants of the cells with a type I scaffold.</p>
<p>-In many cases, they did not generate histologically identifiable cartilage with their cell-free-edited scaffold. They did generate small amounts of bone but this is most likely due to BMPs that were synthesized by the cells and trapped in the matrix.</p>
<p>-There is a great deal of missing detail in the manuscript.</p>
<p>-The in vivo study is underpowered, the results are not well documented pictorially, and are not convincing.</p>
<p>-Given the fact that they have genetically modified cells, they could have done analyses of ECM components to determine what was different between the lines, both at the transcriptome and the protein level. Consequently, the study is purely descriptive and does not provide any mechanistic understanding of what mixture of matrix components and growth factors works best for cartilage or bone. But this presupposes that they actually induced the formation of bona fide cartilage, at least.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors aimed to modify the characteristics of the extracellular matrix (ECM) produced by immortalized mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) by employing the CRISPR/Cas9 system to knock out specific genes. Initially, they established VEGF-KO cell lines, demonstrating that these cells retained chondrogenic and angiogenic properties. Additionally, lyophilized carriage tissues produced by these cells exhibited retained osteogenic properties.</p>
<p>Subsequently, the authors established RUNX2-KO cell lines, which exhibited reduced COLX expression during chondrogenic differentiation and notably diminished osteogenic properties in vitro. Transplantation of lyophilized carriage tissues produced by RUNX2-KO cell lines into osteochondral defects in rat knee joints resulted in the regeneration of articular cartilage tissues as well as bone tissues, a phenomenon not observed with tissues derived from parental cells. This suggests that gene-edited MSCs represent a valuable cell source for producing ECM with enhanced quality.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The enhanced cartilage regeneration observed with ECM derived from RUNX2-KO cells supports the authors' strategy of creating gene-edited MSCs capable of producing ECM with superior quality. Immortalized cell lines offer a limitless source of off-the-shelf material for tissue regeneration.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for the interest in our work. We however want to clarify that the present manuscript does not report the generation of ECM with “superior quality”, but rather of modulated composition and thus function.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Most data align with anticipated outcomes, offering limited novelty to advance scientific understanding. Methodologically, the chondrogenic differentiation properties of immortalized MSCs appeared deficient, evidenced by Safranin-O staining of 3D tissues and histological findings lacking robust evidence for endochondral differentiation. This presents a critical limitation, particularly as authors propose the implantation of cartilage tissues for in vivo experiments. Instead, the bulk of data stemmed from type I collagen scaffold with factors produced by MSCs stimulated by TGFβ.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The chondrogenic differentiation of our MSOD-B line and their capacity of undergoing endochondral ossification has been robustly demonstrated in previous studies (Pigeot et al., Advanced Materials 2021 and Grigoryan et al., Science Translational Medicine 2022). In the present manuscript, we thus compare the chondrogenic capacity of newly established VEGF-KO and RUNX-KO lines to those of MSOD-B cells. We demonstrate by qualitative (Safranin-O staining, Collagen type 2 and Collagen type X immuno-stainings) and quantitative (glycosaminoglycans assay) assays that the generated tissues consist in cartilage grafts of similar quality than the MSOD-B counterpart. Of note, the safranin-O stainings were performed on lyophilized tissues, which can alter the staining quality/intensity. We will thus provide additional stainings of generated tissues pre-lyophilization.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The rationale behind establishing VEGF-KO cell lines remains unclear. What specific outcomes did the authors anticipate from this modification?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>VEGF is a known master regulator of angiogenesis and a key mediator of endochondral ossification. It has also been extensively used in bone tissue engineering studies as a supplemented factor – primarily in the form of VEGFα – to increase the vascularization and thus outcome of bone formation of engineered grafts (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s42003-020-01606-9">https://www.nature.com/articles/s42003-020-01606-9</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S8756328216301752">https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S8756328216301752</ext-link>). In our study, it was thus identified as a natural candidate to demonstrate the possibility to generate VEGF-KO cartilage and subsequently assess the functional impact on both the angiogenic and osteogenic potential of resulting cartilage tissue.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Insufficient depth was given to elucidate the disparity in osteogenic properties between those observed in ectopic bone formation and those observed in transplantation into osteochondral defects. While the regeneration of articular cartilage in RUNX2-KO ECM presents intriguing results, the study lacked an exploration into underlying mechanisms, such as histological analyses at earlier time points.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Using RUNX2-KO ECM, we aimed at demonstrating the impact on cartilage remodeling and bone formation. This was performed ectopically but also in the rat osteochondral defect as a regenerative set-up of higher clinical relevance. We agree with the reviewer that additional experimental groups and time-points (not only earlier but also longer ones) would offer a better mechanistic understanding of the ECM contribution to the joint repair. However, as stated in our manuscript this is a proof-of-concept study that successfully demonstrated the influence of the cartilage ECM modification on the in vivo skeletal regeneration. A follow-up study would need to be performed to complement existing evidence and strengthen the relevance of our approach for cartilage repair.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the Reviewer for the critical evaluation of our work and the highlighted novelty of it.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>-The authors have not generated histologically identifiable cartilage or bone in their transplants of the cells with a type I scaffold.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The chondrogenic differentiation of our MSOD-B line and their capacity of undergoing endochondral ossification has been robustly demonstrated in previous studies (Pigeot et al., Advanced Materials 2021 and Grigoryan et al., Science Translational Medicine 2022). In the present manuscript, we thus compare the chondrogenic capacity of newly established VEGF-KO and RUNX-KO lines to those of MSOD-B. We demonstrate by qualitative (Safranin-O staining, Collagen type 2 and Collagen type X immuno-stainings) and quantitative (glycosaminoglycans assay) assays that the generated tissues consist in cartilage tissue of similar quality than the MSOD-B. However, the safranin-O stainings were performed on lyophilized tissues, which can alter the staining quality/intensity. We will thus provide additional stainings of generated tissues pre-lyophilization.</p>
<p>On the contested formation of bone in vivo by our ECMs grafts, we have provided compelling qualitative evidence via Masson´s Trichrome stainings and quantification of mineralized volume by µCT. Both cortical bone and trabecular structures were identified ectopically. Those are standard evaluation methods in the field, we would be happy to receive additional suggestions by the Reviewer.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>-In many cases, they did not generate histologically identifiable cartilage with their cell-free-edited scaffold. They did generate small amounts of bone but this is most likely due to BMPs that were synthesized by the cells and trapped in the matrix.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We now appreciate that the Reviewer agrees on the successful formation of bone induced by our engineered grafts. We however still respectfully disagree with the “small amount of bone” statement since our MSOD-B and MSOD-B VEGF KO cartilage grafts led to the full generation of a mature ectopic bone organ (that is, also composed of extensive marrow). This has been assessed qualitatively and quantitatively.</p>
<p>We agree with the Reviewer on the key role of BMP-2 in the remodeling process into bone and bone marrow, which we have extensively described in our previous publication (Pigeot et al., Advanced Materials 2021). We previously demonstrated that the low amount of BMP-2 (in the dozens of nanogram/tissue range) embedded in the matrix is not sufficient per se to induce ectopic endochondral ossification. It is the combined presence of GAGs in the matrix -thus cartilage- that allows the success of bone formation. Since we have already demonstrated in the present manuscript that the GAGs content is the same in MSOD-B and MSOD-B edited ECMs, we will provide additional data demonstrating the maintenance of BMP-2 content in all generated cartilage tissues.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>-There is a great deal of missing detail in the manuscript.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We will provide additional information on the MSOD-B line and the overall methodology in our revised version.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>-The in vivo study is underpowered, the results are not well documented pictorially, and are not convincing.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We will provide additional information and pictures related to our in vivo studies. We believe our group size supports our conclusions confirmed by statistical assessment.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>-Given the fact that they have genetically modified cells, they could have done analyses of ECM components to determine what was different between the lines, both at the transcriptome and the protein level.

But this presupposes that they actually induced the formation of bona fide cartilage, at least.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the Reviewer for the suggestion. However, our study did not aim at understanding what ECM graft composition work best for cartilage nor bone regeneration respectively. Instead, we propose the exploitation of our cellular tools to interrogate the function of key ECM constituents and their impact in skeletal regeneration. We once more confirm that we generated lyophilized cartilage grafts which will be more evidently supported by histological assessment before lyophilization.</p>
