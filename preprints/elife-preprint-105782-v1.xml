<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Hematoma expansion is a consistent predictor of poor neurological outcome and mortality after spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). An incomplete understanding of its biophysiology has limited early preventative intervention. Transport-based morphometry (TBM) is a mathematical modeling technique that uses a physically meaningful metric to quantify and visualize discriminating image features that are not readily perceptible to the human eye. We hypothesized that TBM could discover relationships between hematoma morphology on initial Non-Contrast Computed Tomography (NCCT) and hematoma expansion. 170 spontaneous ICH patients enrolled in the multi-center international Virtual International Trials of Stroke Archive (VISTA-ICH) with time-series NCCT data were used for model derivation. Its performance was assessed on a test dataset of 170 patients from the Ethnic/Racial Variations of Intracerebral Hemorrhage (ERICH) study. A unique transport-based representation was produced from each presentation NCCT hematoma image to identify morphological features of expansion. The principal hematoma features identified by TBM were larger size, density heterogeneity, shape irregularity and peripheral density distribution. These were consistent with clinician-identified features of hematoma expansion, corroborating the hypothesis that morphological characteristics of the hematoma promote future growth. Incorporating these traits into a v achieved a AUROC of 0.71 for quantifying 24-hour hematoma expansion risk in the test dataset. This outperformed existing clinician protocols and alternate machine learning methods, suggesting that TBM detected features with improved precision than by visual inspection alone. This pre-clinical study presents a quantitative and interpretable method for discovery and visualization of NCCT biomarkers of hematoma expansion in ICH patients. Because TBM has a direct physical meaning, its modeling of NCCT hematoma features can inform hypotheses for hematoma expansion mechanisms. It has potential future application as a clinical risk stratification tool.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Within hours of spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) onset, hematoma expansion contributes to mass effect and injury to the surrounding brain.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup> It is a preventable predictor of poor neurological outcome and mortality.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup> Biophysical hypotheses for hematoma expansion are primarily derived from small pathological studies and have not been proven in the clinical setting.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup> Although several non-contrast computed tomography (NCCT) features for hematoma expansion have been independently described by clinicians (i.e. swirl sign, blend sign, island sign), a quantitative method for analyzing hematoma morphology from NCCT is lacking.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup> Recent results demonstrating the benefit to ICH surgical evacuation motivates new approaches to enable early detection of hematoma expansion and reduce time-to-intervention in future ICH trial designs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup> Understanding the relationship between NCCT changes in hematoma morphology and the underlying expansion mechanism will be crucial to identifying preventative therapies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>Qualitative NCCT markers of hematoma expansion named by clinicians have been incorporated into clinical scoring systems to predict hematoma expansion. However, their use of subjective criteria has led to scoring variability.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup> Furthermore, use of different terminologies to describe similar features has limited our understanding of the relative diagnostic value of each feature.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup> Deep learning methods for NCCT radiographic marker identification carry advantages of being entirely data-driven and automated.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup> However, they are also limited by their lack of interpretability and provide little to no consideration of the biophysical processes necessary to provide a scientific rationale for their use.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup> There exists a clear need for development of a quantitative and interpretable methodology for NCCT radiographic marker identification which could improve our understanding of hematoma expansion.</p>
<p>Transport-based morphometry (TBM) is a quantitative modeling technique that generates a three-dimensional representation of the entire information content within an image.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup> TBM subsumes well-established image features used in protocols, while also considering features not readily discernible to the human eye.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup> Model inversion permits visualization of discriminating morphological and spatial information.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup> In this pre-clinical study of segmented time-series NCCT hematoma images, we hypothesized that transport-based morphometry (TBM) could discover relationships between NCCT morphometric features and hematoma expansion. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup> Data from the ICH section of the multicenter Virtual International Trials in Stroke Archive (VISTA-ICH) was used to derive the model, and the Ethnic/Racial Variations of Intracerebral Hemorrhage (ERICH) study was used for external validation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup> We demonstrate that (1) TBM model regression can quantify changes in NCCT hematoma morphology to estimate risk of expansion, (2) TBM model inversion permits visualization of NCCT features of expansion to inform hypotheses for its biophysical mechanisms, and (3) a resulting predictive model for future expansion can outperform conventional clinician protocols and machine learning methods.</p>

<title>Dataset composition</title>
<p>Of the 265 spontaneous ICH patients in the VISTA repository with available presentation NCCT scans, 95 were excluded (26 for corrupted/unreadable DICOM files, 3 for surgical evacuation, 9 for infratentorial location, 3 for no 24<italic>±</italic>6 hour interval NCCT scan and 52 for initial ICH volume &lt;7mL). The remaining 170 patients (mean (SD) age 64.08 (12.45) years; 37.6% (n=64) female), comprised the derivation (training and internal validation) dataset. In the derivation dataset, the mean (SD) and median [IQR] hematoma volumes at presentation were 31.31 (24.06) and 25 [14-39] mL, respectively. The mean (SD) and median [IQR] hematoma volumes at 24<italic>±</italic>6 hours were 39.56 (34.42) and 28 [14-54] mL, respectively. Hematoma expansion was present in 32.9% (n=56) patients. Of the 3,000 spontaneous ICH patients in the ERICH study, 1,066 met inclusion criteria and were randomly sampled to generate a test (external validation) dataset of 170 patients, (mean (SD) age 61.14 (13.38) years; 29.2% (n=50) female), 20.0% (n=34) Black, 42.9% (n=73) Hispanic and 35.3% (n=60) White. In the test dataset, the mean (SD) and median [IQR] hematoma volumes at presentation were 25.73 (19.73) and 21 [11-33] mL, respectively. The mean (SD) and median [IQR] hematoma volumes at 24<italic>±</italic>6 hours were 31.59 (24.24) and 26 [12-43] mL, respectively. Hematoma expansion was present in 32.9% (n=56) patients. A flow diagram of the patient selection process for the derivation and test datasets is shown in <bold>eFigure 1</bold>.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Hematoma expansion is a consistent predictor of poor neurological outcome and mortality after spontaneous ICH.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup> Although early detection of hematoma expansion is paramount to implementation of preventative therapies, knowledge of its underlying biophysiological processes is lacking.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup> This has impaired progress towards efficient and reliable methods for detecting patients at risk for expansion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup> In this study, we developed a quantitative method for investigating NCCT hematoma morphology. Our TBM framework discovered hematoma morphological changes associated with expansion and was interpretable through model inversion. This novel approach discovers hypotheses for hematoma expansion pathophysiology and has the potential to improve its clinical prediction.</p>
<p>We considered normalized Hounsfield Unit (HU) pixel intensity values as relative measurements of blood density and applied our transport-based morphometry (TBM) technique to model the relative intensity of each pixel in a segmented NCCT hematoma image with reference to a template.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup> Thus, optimal transportation-based modeling of hematoma images provided insight into inherent physical phenomena.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup> When linear models were applied to the resulting transport space representations, we found a significant correlation between NCCT hematoma morphological changes and 24-hour hematoma growth. Inclusion of clinical variables and spatial location achieved further improved performance, resulting in an AUC of 0.71 for predicting hematoma expansion. Taken together, our findings suggest that TBM could discriminate 24-hour hematoma expansion from NCCT image features.</p>
<p>One advantage of our method is its interpretability. Feature visualization by TBM provided radiographic insight into the process of hematoma expansion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup> The conventional biological model for hematoma expansion is the “avalanche effect”, first observed in a pathological study from 1971.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup> This described the process of secondary mechanical shearing of neighboring vessels at the periphery of the hematoma, resulting in successive bleeding. It was corroborated by a more recent pathological study that observed hematomas to expand in the perivascular spaces and detach branches from surrounding tissue, resulting in secondary bleeding.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup> These proposed mechanisms of hematoma expansion have not previously been examined in a large real-time patient sample. When we inverted our TBM model to generate visualizations of the NCCT features correlating most with expansion, we discovered morphological characteristics of expansion that were not visibly discernible on the native images. Notably, we observed preferential distribution of density towards the periphery of the expanding hematoma, which may be consistent with involvement of secondary circumferential vessels. Density heterogeneity further suggested that the hematoma expanded from bleeding at different times and locations.</p>
<p>While the affected location may harbor characteristic structural properties that facilitate expansion, there is conflicting evidence regarding location(s) with the propensity for expansion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup> Hematoma location has not yet been included as a potential modifier in expansion prediction scores.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup> We defined location from the center of the hematoma, finding it to be a significant independent predictor of expansion that improved the TBM model’s performance. The location most discriminating expansion was oriented towards the thalamus, posterior limb of the internal capsule and atrium of the lateral ventricle. This correlated with the orientation of the perivascular spaces and the proposed pathological mechanism of blood product transit via these spaces, representing the path of least resistance surrounding the hematoma.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup> These findings lend weight to the importance of further study into the relationships between NCCT image characteristics and the biomechanics of hematoma expansion.</p>
<p>The shape, size and density NCCT characteristics identified by TBM are consistent with those previously described by clinicians.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup> This emphasizes similarities between our TBM model and clinician-based interpretation of ICH from NCCT, corroborating their hypothesis that morphological characteristics of the hematoma promote future growth.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup> In contrast to clinician-based methods, TBM overcame the subjectivity inherent to qualitative ranking, standardized the range of terminologies that have previously been attributed to similar image features, and permitted grading of severity. When we measured TBM-identified NCCT image features from the native image data, they were statistically significant predictors of expansion but each was outperformed by the final TBM model in the test dataset. Similarly, TBM outperformed established clinician-based NCCT prediction scores and emerging machine learning models.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup> By including all information contained within a segmented hematoma image, we propose that TBM achieved greater precision and improved generalizability than pre-specified feature detection alone.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup> Like RAPID-AI for ischemic stroke, further optimization of TBM could lead to a reliable and efficient method for hematoma expansion prediction to select patients for timely intervention.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup></p>
<p>Several limitations to this study must be acknowledged. Although we included a representative multi-national population of patients enrolled in ICH clinical trials with standardized time-series NCCT data, our model derivation cohort was limited by its small sample size of 170 patients and retrospective design.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup> Because we randomly sampled an equivalent-sized external validation dataset from the ERICH cohort study, the generalizability of the results are limited by the potential for confounding factors inherent to the validation dataset that were not accounted for. Future validation studies should investigate larger cohorts and/or matching paradigms to account for this limitation prior to drawing conclusions as to the potential clinical utility of TBM. The limited density information on NCCT and the small number of patients who experienced hematoma expansion in our dataset are likely to have affected the predictive strength of the model.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup> Therefore, in spite of dimensionality reduction and external validation, our model remains at risk of overfitting. Our AUC of 0.71 in the external validation dataset, while superior to alternate clinician-based and machine learning methods, indicates moderate predictive performance, and is not yet sufficient for clinical application. In addition, the poor performance of alternate machine learning methods in our test dataset warrants further investigation for potential sampling errors. Future external validation studies should consider case-matched patient sampling, adjustment for confounders, and consideration of multiple cross-validation resampling methods prior to defining an optimal model. The relative importance of demographic and clinical predictors of hematoma expansion and the methods for incorporating these data into predictive modeling also warrants further investigation in future studies. Because our expansion definition was not based on clinical outcome, we expect future studies to investigate relationships between NCCT hematoma morphology, hematoma expansion, and neurological outcome. The derivation dataset utilized input of manually segmented images, which can be time consuming and impractical. Future studies should continue to take advantage of fully automated hematoma segmentation methods as they undergo validation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup> As a promising preclinical study, our TBM model motivates additional external validation and prospective studies. These are needed to define its translation potential to a real-world clinical setting.</p>

<p>In this pre-clinical study, we present a quantitative and interpretable approach for discovery of non-contrast computed tomography (NCCT) markers of hematoma expansion in spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage patients. Transport-based morphometry discriminated morphological characteristics of 24-hour hematoma expansion from presentation NCCT scans. Model inversion generated visual interpretations of the features discovered by the model. This quantitative approach has the potential to improve hematoma expansion prediction.

<p>The de-identified NCCT scans at presentation and 24<italic>±</italic>6 hours after the initial scan were transferred in Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) format to a central workstation. NCCT data was pre-processed according to a standard protocol as follows: (1) 3D DICOM CT images and their corresponding segmented hematoma regions were converted to a 3-channel NumPy array; (2) windowing was performed by applying a threshold of 0 to 150 Hounsfield Units (HU) to the original gray-scale NCCT image; (3) the region corresponding to skull was removed using the Brain Extraction Tool from the open source FMRIB Software Library version 6.0 (Analysis Group, FMRIB, Oxford, UK); (4) each NCCT image and its corresponding segmented hematoma region were registered to a population-based, high-resolution NCCT template and re-sized to dimensions of 256 x 256 x 256 with voxel spacings of 1 x 1 x 1mm using the Symmetric Normalization method from the Advanced Normalization Tools in Python package version 0.1.8; (5) the background of each NCCT image and its corresponding segmented hematoma region were cropped, reducing the image dimensions to 150 x 190 x 120; (6) segmented hematoma images located in the left hemisphere were translated across midline, so that all hematomas were registered in the right hemisphere; (7) a 3D curvature-driven gaussian filter with a step size of 0.125 using a total of 5 steps was applied to smooth the segmented hematoma images; (8) each segmented hematoma image was normalized so that the sum of its intensities was equal to 1.

<title>3D transport-based morphometry</title>
<p>The optimal mass transport problem seeks the most efficient way of transforming one distribution of mass to another, by minimizing a cost function.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup> Transport-based morphometry (TBM) performs nonlinear image transformations by solving the continuous linear optimal transportation problem. Transforming images from their native domain to a transport domain affords three key advantages: (1) it permits discovery of discriminating image features that are not readily perceptible to the human eye, (2) it provides a physically meaningful metric, the Wasserstein distance, to quantify the relative changes in intensity between two images, and (3) it interpolates between images to generate visual interpretations of the discriminating features discovered by the model.</p>

<title>Continuous linear optimal transport</title>
<p>We considered normalized Hounsfield Unit (HU) pixel intensity values as relative measurements of blood density and assumed that hematoma expansion occurs as a continuous process of red blood cell movement under the effect of unknown biological and physical influences.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup> This assumption allowed us to quantify the relative movement of blood density from one image to another.

<title>Model derivation</title>
<p>Solving the continuous optimal transportation problem results in a unique linearly embedded 3D mass preserving (MP) map. We obtained the MP map for the segmented presentation NCCT hematoma image of each patient. In the derivation cohort, these data were shuffled at random and separated into independent training (60%) and internal validation (40%) cohorts for model derivation and optimization. To minimize bias in data sampling, this process was repeated 1000 times to generate 1000 different training and internal validation splits. The dataset composition is described further in the <bold>Online-only supplement</bold>.

<title>Outcomes</title>
<p>Outcomes were (1) significant hematoma expansion, defined as ≥6mL increase in hematoma volume between the presentation and 24<italic>±</italic>6-hour NCCT scans, and (2) hematoma growth, defined as absolute hematoma volume (mL) increase between the presentation and 24<italic>±</italic>6 hour NCCT scans. Absolute hematoma volume increase (mL) was chosen for its reduced susceptibility to the effect of the size of the initial hematoma and stronger association with clinical outcome, than relative volume change (%). Significant hematoma expansion was set at 6 mL to reflect the threshold most used by established hematoma expansion prediction methods and in ICH clinical outcomes studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup> For the prediction of neurological outcome, lower hematoma expansion thresholds have been found to provide improved sensitivity at the expense of specificity, while higher thresholds provide improved specificity at the expense of sensitivity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup></p>

<title>Principal components analysis</title>
<p>Because the dimensionality of the hematoma image features in transport space was much higher than the number of data samples, we utilized the principal components analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup> PCA is described in detail in the <bold>Online-only supplement</bold>.

<title>Effect of location on expansion</title>
<p>To evaluate the independent effect of hematoma location on expansion, we defined location as the <italic>x, y</italic> and <italic>z</italic> co-ordinates of the center of each presentation NCCT hematoma image and used covariance matrices to represent the initial hematoma location with reference to the center of the mass of the template image <italic>I</italic><sub>0µ</sub>.

We compared baseline demographic and clinical information between expansion and no expansion groups using the χ<sup>2</sup>, independent t- or non-parametric tests, as appropriate.

<title>External validation</title>
<p>An equivalent-sized dataset of 170 patients with a hematoma expansion rate of 25 – 33% was estimated to have a power of 0.97 – 0.99 to detect an AUC of 0.7 at the 0.05 significance level, given a null AUC of 0.5. For external validation of the model, we randomly sampled eligible patients from the ERICH repository to generate a test dataset of 170 patients with a equivalent number of hematoma expansion cases as the derivation dataset (n=56). In the test dataset, we obtained the MP map for the segmented presentation NCCT hematoma of each patient according to abovementioned methods. We performed dimensionality reduction using the abovementioned PCA method and adjusted for the relevant co-variates as determined by the optimal multivariable TBM model. The trained PLDA and CCA classifiers from the derivation dataset were applied to the external validation dataset and the optimal TBM model’s performance for discriminating hematoma expansion and predicting future hematoma volume was assessed in the test dataset using abovementioned statistical analyses.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The study explores the use of Transport-based morphometry (TBM) to predict hematoma expansion and growth 24 hours post-event, leveraging Non-Contrast Computed Tomography (NCCT) scans combined with clinical and location-based information. The research holds significant clinical potential, as it could enable early intervention for patients at high risk of hematoma expansion, thereby improving outcomes. The study is well-structured, with detailed methodological descriptions and a clear presentation of results. However, the practical utility of the predictive tool requires further validation, as the current findings are based on retrospective data. Additionally, the impact of this tool on clinical decision-making and patient outcomes needs to be further investigated.</p>
<p>Strengths</p>
<p>(1) Clinical Relevance: The study addresses a critical need in clinical practice by providing a tool that could enhance diagnostic accuracy and guide early interventions, potentially improving patient outcomes.</p>
<p>(2) Feature Visualization: The visualization and interpretation of features associated with hematoma expansion risk are highly valuable for clinicians, aiding in the understanding of model-derived insights and facilitating clinical application.</p>
<p>(3) Methodological Rigor: The study provides a thorough description of methods, results, and discussions, ensuring transparency and reproducibility.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) The limited sample size in this study raises concerns about potential model overfitting. While the reported AUCROC of 0.71 may be acceptable for clinical use, the robustness of the model could be further enhanced by employing techniques such as k-fold cross-validation. This approach, which aggregates predictive results across multiple folds, mimics the consensus of diagnoses from multiple clinicians and could improve the model's reliability for clinical application. Additionally, in clinical practice, the utility of the model may depend on specific conditions, such as achieving high specificity to identify patients at risk of hematoma expansion, thereby enabling timely interventions. Consequently, while AUC is a commonly used metric, it may not fully capture the model's clinical applicability. The authors should consider discussing alternative performance metrics, such as specificity and sensitivity, which are more aligned with clinical needs. Furthermore, evaluating the model's performance in real-world clinical scenarios would provide valuable insights into its practical utility and potential impact on patient outcomes.</p>
<p>(2) The authors compared the performance of TBM with clinical and location-based information, as well as other machine learning methods. While this comparison highlights the relative strengths of TBM, the study would benefit from providing concrete evidence on how this tool could enhance clinicians' ability to assess hematoma expansion in practice. For instance, it remains unclear whether integrating the model's output with a clinician's own assessment would lead to improved diagnostic accuracy or decision-making. Investigating this aspect-such as through studies evaluating the combined performance of clinician judgment and model predictions-could significantly enhance the tool's practical value.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The author presents a transport-based morphometry (TBM) approach for the discovery of non-contrast computed tomography (NCCT) markers of hematoma expansion risk in spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) patients. The findings demonstrate that TBM can quantify hematoma morphological features and outperforms existing clinical scoring systems in predicting 24-hour hematoma expansion. In addition, the inversion model can visualize features, which makes it interpretable. In conclusion, this research has clinical potential for ICH risk stratification, improving the precision of early interventions.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>TBM quantifies hematoma morphological changes using the Wasserstein distance, which has a well-defined physical meaning. It identifies features that are difficult to detect through conventional visual inspection (such as peripheral density distribution and density heterogeneity), which provides evidence supporting the &quot;avalanche effect&quot; hypothesis in hematoma expansion pathophysiology.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) As a methodology-focused study, the description of the methods section somewhat lacks depth and focus, which may make it challenging for readers to fully grasp the overall structure and workflow of the approach. For instance, the manuscript lacks a systematic overview of the entire process, from NCCT image input to the final prediction output. A potential improvement would be to include a workflow figure at the beginning of the manuscript, summarizing the proposed method and subsequent analytical procedures. This would help readers better understand the mechanism of the model.</p>
<p>(2) The description of the comparison algorithms could be more detailed. Since TBM directly utilizes NCCT images as input for prediction, while SVM and K-means are not inherently designed to process raw imaging data, it would be beneficial to clarify which specific features or input data were used for these comparison models. This would better highlight the effectiveness and advantages of the TBM method.</p>
<p>(3) The relatively small training and testing dataset may limit the model's performance and generalizability. Notably, while the study mentions that 1,066 patients from the ERICH dataset met the inclusion criteria, only 170 were randomly selected for the test set. Leveraging the full 1,066 ERICH cases for model training and internal validation might potentially enhance the model's robustness and performance.</p>
<p>(4) Some minor textual issues need to be checked and corrected, such as line 16 in the abstract &quot;Incorporating these traits into a v achieved an AUROC of 0.71 ...&quot;.</p>
<p>(5) Some figures need to be reformatted (e.g., the x-axis in Figure 2 a is blocked).</p>
