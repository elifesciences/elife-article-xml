<title>Abstract</title><p>Septins can function as scaffolds for protein recruitment, membrane-bound diffusion barriers, or membrane curvature sensors. Septins are important for cytokinesis, but their exact roles are still obscure. In fission yeast, four septins (Spn1 to Spn4) accumulate at the rim of the division plane as rings. The octameric exocyst complex, which tethers exocytic vesicles to the plasma membrane, exhibits a similar localization and is essential for plasma membrane deposition during cytokinesis. Without septins, the exocyst spreads across the division plane but absent from the rim during septum formation. These results suggest that septins and the exocyst physically interact for proper localization and function. Indeed, we predicted six pairs of interactions between septin and exocyst subunits by AlphaFold, most of them are confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation and yeast two-hybrid assays. Exocyst mislocalization results in mistargeting of secretory vesicles and their cargos, which leads to cell-separation delay in septin mutants. Our results indicate that septins guide the targeting of exocyst complex on the plasma membrane for vesicle tethering during cytokinesis through physical interactions.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Septins are a family of GTP-binding proteins that are highly conserved from yeast to mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Longtine et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Gladfelter et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Cao et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c101">Nishihama et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c106">Onishi and Pringle, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Marquardt et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c140">Woods and Gladfelter, 2021</xref>). They form hetero-oligomeric complexes that can assemble into different higher-order structures such as rings, gauzes, hourglasses, and carry out various functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Frazier et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Hsu et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Kinoshita, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c116">Sheffield et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Bertin et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Garcia et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Bridges et al., 2014</xref>). Septins can serve as scaffolds for protein recruitment at discrete cellular locations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Gladfelter et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c131">Versele and Thorner, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c97">Mostowy and Cossart, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Finnigan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">Meitinger and Palani, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c108">Perez et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Marquardt et al., 2019</xref>). Septins are proposed to act as a diffusion barrier to ensure that cellular components are spatially segregated or compartmentalized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Dobbelaere and Barral, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Caudron and Barral, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Hu and Nelson, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">McMurray et al., 2011</xref>). They can also sense the membrane curvatures and/or deform the plasma membrane due to their lipid-binding properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Bridges and Gladfelter, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Cannon et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Cannon et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">McMurray, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c118">Shi et al., 2023</xref>). The diverse roles of septins lead to their involvement in multiple processes including cytokinesis, mitosis, exocytosis, apoptosis, fungal or viral infections, neuronal spine morphogenesis, ciliogenesis, and spermiogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Longtine et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Kartmann and Roth, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c97">Mostowy and Cossart, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Dolat et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c95">Momany and Talbot, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Ageta-Ishihara and Kinoshita, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c99">Neubauer and Zieger, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c140">Woods and Gladfelter, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c113">Safavian et al., 2023</xref>).</p>
<p>One of the best-studied septin functions is their roles in cytokinesis in the budding yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Hartwell, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Haarer and Pringle, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Ford and Pringle, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Kim et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">DeMarini et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Bi et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Lippincott and Li, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Longtine et al., 1998</xref>). The septin ring or hourglass structures at the presumptive bud site and bud neck are required for the recruitment and maintenance of various cytokinesis proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Bi et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Lippincott and Li, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Gladfelter et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Longtine and Bi, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Marquardt et al., 2019</xref>). These roles occur through either direct interactions with proteins such as the F-BAR protein Hof1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c128">Vallen et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">Meitinger et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c103">Oh et al., 2013</xref>), or through septin-binding proteins such as Bni5, which links septins to the myosin-II heavy chain Myo1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Lee et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Fang et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Finnigan et al., 2015</xref>). During cytokinesis, the septin double rings were proposed to function as a diffusion barrier for proteins such as the exocyst component Sec3 and chitin synthase II Chs2 at the division site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Dobbelaere and Barral, 2004</xref>). But other studies have challenged this view by showing that Chs2 localizes efficiently to the division site in the absence of septin rings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c138">Wloka et al., 2011</xref>). Regardless of the debate, septins are known to play essential roles in budding yeast cytokinesis. However, no physical interactions between septins and the exocyst have been reported, even in the genome wide interactome studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93">Michaelis et al., 2023</xref>). Moreover, budding yeast septins also serve as scaffolds for the localization of hundreds of proteins at the bud neck including signaling proteins, bud site selection proteins, and chitin synthases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Longtine et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">DeMarini et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Gladfelter et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Longtine and Bi, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Marquardt et al., 2019</xref>).</p>
<p>Unlike in budding yeast, septins are not essential in the fission yeast <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> and their roles in cytokinesis remain obscure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Longtine et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Berlin et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c123">Tasto et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c142">Wu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c151">Zheng et al., 2024</xref>). Fission yeast has seven septins, Spn1 to Spn7, with Spn1 to Spn4 expressing in vegetative cells and functioning at the division site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Longtine et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Berlin et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c123">Tasto et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">An et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c110">Petit et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c105">Onishi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c142">Wu et al., 2010</xref>). None of the septins Spn1-Spn4 is essential, but loss of some or all of them causes a delay in cell separation, resulting in multi-septated phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">An et al., 2004</xref>). Spn1 and Spn4 are the more important components of the septin ring structure during cytokinesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">An et al., 2004</xref>). Septins accumulate to the division site shortly before the contractile ring constriction and form a single ring which quickly transitions into unconstricting double rings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Berlin et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c123">Tasto et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c141">Wu et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c142">Wu et al., 2010</xref>). It is only known that septins recruit the anillin Mid2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Berlin et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c123">Tasto et al., 2003</xref>), the guanine nucleotide exchange factor Gef3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c98">MuÃ±oz et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c136">Wang et al., 2015</xref>), the small GTPase Rho4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c136">Wang et al., 2015</xref>), and the glucanases Eng1 and Agn1 to the division site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Martin-Cuadrado et al., 2005</xref>). Thus, we know much less about fission yeast septins compared to those in budding yeast. It remains mysterious what the most conserved functions of septins are during evolution.</p>
<p>Previous studies have suggested that septins function in exocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Hsu et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c130">Vega and Hsu, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Martin-Cuadrado et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c109">Perez et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c127">Tokhtaeva et al., 2015</xref>). Fission yeast septins are proposed to work with the exocyst complex to regulate the secretion of glucanases at the appropriate location, but it was reported that septins and the exocyst are independent for localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Martin-Cuadrado et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c109">Perez et al., 2015</xref>). The exocyst is a highly conserved, octameric complex (Sec3, Sec5, Sec6, Sec8, Sec10, Sec15, Exo70, and Exo84) in exocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c125">TerBush et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c133">Wang et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Hsu et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Heider and Munson, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Liu and Guo, 2012</xref>). It functions in late stages of exocytosis by promoting the tethering and fusion of post-Golgi secretory vesicles to the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c125">TerBush et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Hsu et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Liu et al., 2018</xref>). Although studies suggest that septins regulate the exocyst complex and a possible involvement of septins in targeting secretory vesicles to the exocytic sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Hsu et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c130">Vega and Hsu, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Li et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Gupta et al., 2015</xref>), no direct physical interactions between septins and the exocyst subunits have been reported in budding yeast or other organisms.</p>
<p>Here we report septins regulate the exocyst localization and vesicle targeting in fission yeast via physical interactions. We find that the loss of septin rings alters the exocyst localization, with increased concentration to the center and reduced localization to the rim of the division plane. The initial recruitment of the exocyst is independent of septins, but the exocyst requires septin rings to maintain the rim localization during furrow ingression. Consistently, we found multivalent physical interactions consistent with direct binding between septins and the exocyst subunits. Loss of the exocyst ring leads to abnormal accumulation of secretory vesicles in septin mutants. As a result, the glucan synthase Bgs1/Cps1 accumulates more to the center and the glucanase Eng1 is missing from the rim of the division plane, contributing to delayed cell separation and a thicker septum in septin mutant cells. Our findings provide insights into the regulation of the exocyst localization and function on the plasma membrane by septins in other systems.</p>

<title>The septin and exocyst complex colocalize and are partially interdependent for localization at the division site</title>
<p>Both septins and the exocyst complex localize to the division site during cytokinesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Longtine et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c133">Wang et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">An et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c110">Petit et al., 2005</xref>). To understand if and how they work together, we first examined the colocalization of the septin Spn1 and the exocyst subunit Sec3 in fission yeast. Spn1 is a key component in septin structures, and its deletion leads to a complete loss of all septins from the division site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">An et al., 2004</xref>). Sec3 is a spatial landmark for exocytosis in budding yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Finger et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Boyd et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Luo et al., 2014</xref>). The fission yeast Sec3 is an essential gene and crucial for exocyst localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Kim et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Bendezu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Jourdain et al., 2012</xref>). Spn1 and Sec3 colocalized at the division site as a single ring first, and later as double rings during septum formation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>, A and B). The colocalization of Spn1 with another exocyst subunit Exo70 was confirmed using SoRa (Super resolution by Optical Re-Assignment) spinning disk confocal microscopy (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1C</xref>). Sec3 and Exo70, but not Spn1, also concentrated at cell tips (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>, C and D). However, Sec3 arrived at the division site 13.4 Â± 2.2 min after spindle pole body (SPB) separation, about 10 min earlier than Spn1 that arrived at 23.6 Â± 1.8 min (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>, D and E). Time lapse movies of Exo70-tdTomato and Spn1-mEGFP confirmed that the exocyst appeared at the division site earlier than septins (Video 1). These observations suggest the spatial proximity between septins and the exocyst during certain stage of cytokinesis, raising the possibility of their functional coordination, which we would further investigate below.</p>

<p>Since the septin and exocyst colocalize at the division site and Sec3 arrives earlier, we tested whether septin localization depends on Sec3 and other exocyst subunits. In WT cells, Spn1 always formed ring structures at the rim of division plane during septation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>). In exocyst mutants <italic>exo70</italic>Î and the temperature sensitive <italic>sec3-913</italic> and <italic>sec8-1</italic>, Spn1 localization was comparable to WT at permissive temperature (Figure supplement S1A). At the restrictive temperature, although Spn1 localized as a ring at the division site before septation, a fraction of Spn1 abnormally spread onto the division plane following furrow ingression in <italic>sec3-913</italic> and <italic>sec8-1</italic> mutants (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>, red boxes; and Figure supplement S1B, middle focal plane). As <italic>exo70</italic>Î cells have no severe defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c132">Wang et al., 2003</xref>), the exocyst complex may not be as compromised as in <italic>sec3-913</italic> and <italic>sec8-1</italic> mutants. Only minor mislocalization of Spn1 was observed in <italic>exo70</italic>Î cells even at 36Â°C (Figure supplement S1B). This localization pattern in exocyst mutants suggested a possible correlation between septins and the furrow ingression. Indeed, some Spn1 followed the contractile ring marked with Rng8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c135">Wang et al., 2014</xref>) as it constricted, spread onto the new plasma membrane, and concentrated at the center of the division plane while maintaining its localization at the rim (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G</xref>). We also examined Spn1 levels at the division site in cells with no visible septum, forming septum, and closed septum. Spn1 levels were comparable or higher in exocyst mutants compared to WT at both 25Â°C and 36Â°C (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1H</xref> and Figure supplement S1, C and D). FRAP analyses of Spn1 showed no difference in its dynamics in WT and <italic>sec3-913</italic> cells at 36Â°C (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1I</xref> and Figure supplement S1E). Collectively, despite some Spn1 mislocalizes to the center of the division plane in exocyst mutants, majority of Spn1 still localizes to the rim. Thus, septins only partially depend on the exocyst for their localization.</p>
<p>Next, we examined the localization and levels of the exocyst complex (subunits Sec3, Exo70, and Sec8) in <italic>spn1</italic>Î cells. In mitotic cells without a septum, the exocyst localized to the rim of the division plane in both WT and <italic>spn1</italic>Î cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2A</xref> and Figure supplement S1, F and G, yellow boxes). During septation, however, the exocyst spread across the division plane as a disk in <italic>spn1</italic>Î cells while it remained at the rim in WT cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2A</xref> and Figure supplement S1, F and G, red boxes). The levels of Sec3, Exo70, and Sec8 at the division site in <italic>spn1</italic>Î cells were not significantly different from WT before septation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2B</xref> and Figure supplement S1H). During and after septum formation, the levels of all three exocyst components were significantly reduced at the division site (except Exo70 in cells with forming septum) and almost absent at the rim in <italic>spn1</italic>Î cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2</xref>, A and B; and Figure supplement S1, F-H). These results were confirmed in cells expressed Sec8-GFP and myosin light chain Rlc1 as a contractile ring marker (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>, D and E). However, the dynamics of Sec3 at the division site was not affected in <italic>spn1</italic>Î cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2C</xref> and Figure supplement S1I). The exocyst was much more dynamic than septins at the division site (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1H</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2C</xref>), which was confirmed by high temporal resolution imaging of Exo70 (Videos 2 and 3). Together, loss of septins results in exocyst mislocalization and its decreased levels, especially at the rim of the division plane during septum formation, suggesting that septins play an important role in regulating the exocyst localization at the division site.</p>

<p>Collectively, our data suggest that septins and the exocyst complex colocalize and are interdependent for localization at the division site during and after the contractile ring constriction, with the septin rings being more important for the exocyst localization. Thus, we conclude that the initial recruitment of the exocyst to the division site does not depend on septins, but its rim localization and maintenance during late cytokinesis require the septin rings.</p>

<title>Septins regulate the exocyst localization through physical interactions</title>
<p>Septins have been shown to play a role in the Rho GEF Gef3-Rho4 GTPase pathway to regulate the exocytosis of glucanases Eng1 and Agn1 for proper cell separation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c109">Perez et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c136">Wang et al., 2015</xref>). Septins are essential for Gef3 localization to the division site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c98">MuÃ±oz et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c136">Wang et al., 2015</xref>). In <italic>spn1</italic>Î cells, Gef3 localization on the plasma membrane is abolished, and Rho4 localization in cells with a closed septum was significantly reduced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c136">Wang et al., 2015</xref>). Since Rho4 can interact with both the exocyst complex and septins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c109">Perez et al., 2015</xref>), we tested whether the altered exocyst localization pattern that we observed in septin mutants was through Gef3 and Rho4. Although partially mislocalized to the center of the division plane, majority of Sec3 still localized as a ring at the rim of division plane in <italic>rho4</italic>Î, <italic>gef3</italic>Î, and <italic>rho4</italic>Î <italic>gef3</italic>Î cells (Figure supplement S2A). Moreover, Spn1 ring localization was not affected in <italic>rho4</italic>Î <italic>gef3</italic>Î cells (Figure supplement S2B). Thus, the different localization patterns of the exocyst in <italic>spn1</italic>Î and <italic>rho4</italic>Î <italic>gef3</italic>Î cells suggest that septins can regulate exocyst localization independent of Gef3 and Rho4.</p>
<p>To test the hypothesis that septins regulate the localization of the exocyst directly, we examined the physical interactions between septins and the exocyst subunits. Sec3 and Exo70 are the most important subunits for the targeting of the octameric exocyst to the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Boyd et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">He et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Bendezu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Luo et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c147">Yue et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Liu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c122">Synek et al., 2021</xref>), and Spn1 and Spn4 are essential for septin localization and functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">An et al., 2004</xref>). Therefore, we first tested the interactions between Spn1-Sec3, Spn1-Exo70, Spn4-Sec3, and Spn4-Exo70 using co-immunoprecipitation of cell extracts from fission yeast. Surprisingly, no physical interactions were detected among the four proteins.</p>
<p>Then we utilized AlphaFold2_advanced ColabFold algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Jumper et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c94">Mirdita et al., 2022</xref>), whose highly accurate predictions of protein structures have revolutionized structural biology, to predict the physical interactions between all 32 combinations of the four septins and eight exocyst subunits. For the modeling, the complete sequences of each subunit of septins and exocyst complex were used except Sec8. Sec8 subunit was analyzed in two fragments with overlapping sequence due to the 1,400 amino acids input sequence limitation of AlphaFold2_advanced. The generated models with the highest confidence are shown (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref> and Figure supplement S3). Predicted interacting interface residues that defined as amino acids of two possible binding partners with distance â¤4 Ã were calculated from the rank 1 predicted model (Yin and Pierce, 2023). Then the contact residues were further narrowed down by excluding the residues having pLDDT score &lt;50. Based on the above analyses, we predicted the following top six interactions between the septin and exocyst subunits: Spn2 and Sec15 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>), Sec15 and Spn1, Sec6 and Spn1, Spn2 and Sec5, Spn4 and Sec15, and Spn4 and Sec3 (Figure supplement S3).</p>

</fig>
<p>To test whether the interacting residues calculated from the pair-wise predictions are accessible in the whole exocyst or septin complexes, we employed AlphaFold3 and the cryo-EM structure of the whole <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> exocyst complex (with 4.4 â« resolution) to examine the interfaces of septins and the exocyst interactions, assuming that the <italic>S. pombe</italic> exocyst has the similar structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">Mei et al., 2018</xref>). For the septin complex, we first predicted its octameric structure using two copies of each fission yeast Spn1-4. We examined all the interacting residues on the septin and exocyst complex predicted from our AlphaFold2 modeling to determine whether these predicted interactions are structurally compatible (Figure supplement S4 and S5A; Videos 4 and 5). Our analyses revealed that 84% of exocyst and 96% of septin predicted interacting residues were sterically feasible without disrupting the architecture of exocyst or septin complex (the residues highlighted in yellow in Figure supplement S4 and S5; Videos 4 and 5), while others would likely require partial disassembly or flexible conformations. Because septins can also form hexameric complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">McMurray and Thorner, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c92">MendonÃ§a et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c121">Soroor et al., 2021</xref>), we also predicted hexameric septin complexes without either Spn2 or Spn3 and found that 86% or 92% exocyst-interacting residues are available on the surface, respectively (Figure supplementary S5, B and C; Videos 6-7). We did not predict a septin hexameric complex without Spn1 or Spn4 as they are the core subunits responsible for septin localization and functions at the division site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">An et al., 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c105">Onishi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c142">Wu et al., 2010</xref>). These predictions indicate that these septin-exocyst interactions are sterically plausible.</p>
<p>Next, we used reciprocal Co-IP assays of fission yeast extracts to confirm the predicted interactions between septin and exocyst subunits. Out of the six predicted interactions, we found five of them were positive in Co-IP. We found that Spn2 physically interacted with Sec5 and Sec15, Spn1 with Sec15 and Sec6, and Spn4 with Sec15 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4</xref> and Figure supplement S6). Sec15 interacted with three septins Spn1, Spn2, and Spn4, which was stronger than other combinations. We also utilized yeast two-hybrid assays to confirm these five-pair of interactions (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>, E and F). X-gal overlay assay (insets) and quantification of Î²-galactosidase using ONPG confirmed that Sec15 may directly interacted with Spn1, Spn2, and Spn4 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>); and Sec6 interacted with Spn1 through its C-terminal fragment (Spn1[300-469]) that contains the coiled-coil motif (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>). The Spn2-Sec5 interaction could not be tested due to very high level of autoactivation of Sec5. Thus, we conclude that septins physically and likely interact directly with the exocyst in fission yeast via multivalent interactions.</p>

<title>Septins are involved in concentrating Sec15 and Sec5 at the rim of the division plane especially during the late-stage of cytokinesis</title>

<p>Collectively, our data indicate that septins play important roles in maintaining the proper localization and targeting of the exocyst on the plasma membrane. This regulation on the exocyst occurs specifically during late stages of cytokinesis in fission yeast. Loss of septins results in spreading of the exocyst across the division plane and tethering of secretory vesicles at wrong destination, which leads to the accumulation of secretory vesicles and mistargeting of downstream cargos.</p>

<p>In this study, we reveal that septins and the exocyst complex physically interact to regulate exocytosis and ensure proper targeting of vesicle cargos to the plasma membrane during cytokinesis.</p>

<title>Septins are important for proper membrane targeting of the exocyst complex to ensure successful cytokinesis</title>
<p>Septins are essential for cytokinesis and other cellular processes in budding yeast and many other organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c100">Neufeld and Rubin, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Longtine et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Kinoshita et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Gladfelter et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c112">Russell and Hall, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c102">Oh and Bi, 2011</xref>). However, the nature of their functions is only partially understood. It has been a mystery why the phenotypes of septin mutants are quite mild in fission yeast ever since their discoveries in the early 1990s, yet their sequences and structures are evolutionarily conserved across species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Longtine et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">An et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c150">Zheng et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c151">Zheng et al., 2024</xref>). In this study, we investigated the spatial regulation of the exocyst complex and roles of septins during cytokinesis in the fission yeast model system. Without septin rings, the exocyst complex, which specifies for the sites for vesicle fusion on the plasma membrane, cannot maintain its localization at the rim of the division plane. Instead, the exocyst complex follows actomyosin contractile ring constriction and spreads across the whole division plane. Although loss of septins does not affect the dynamics of the exocyst, the targeting sites of secretory vesicles and their cargos are altered, which may contribute to a thicker septum and a delayed cell separation. The modest accumulation of vesicles and vesicle cargos at the division site is one of the reasons for the increased thickness of the division septum in septin mutants. It is more likely that the misplaced exocyst can still tether vesicles along the division plane without septins. Due to the lack of the glucanase Eng1 at the rim of the division plane in septin mutants, daughter-cell separation is delayed and then cells continue to thicken the septum. The relatively modest vesicle accumulation in septin mutants suggests that septins are not absolutely required for vesicle tethering or fusion per se at the division site. Instead, septins primarily function to spatially organize the targeting sites of exocyst-directed vesicles by stabilizing the localization of the exocyst at the rim of the cleavage furrow. In septin mutants, mislocalization of the exocyst reduces the spatial precision of membrane insertion but still permits vesicle tethering and fusion, albeit in a less controlled manner. Thus, septins likely play a modulatory rather than essential role in exocytic vesicle delivery during cytokinesis. This interpretation aligns with our localization and genetic interaction data, which indicates that septins act as scaffolds to optimize secretion geometry, rather than as core components of the fusion machinery. Thus, fission yeast septins function in exocytosis through maintaining proper docking sites of the exocyst complex and secretory vesicles at the division site.</p>
<p>Both the exocyst and TRAPP-II complex tether vesicles at the cleavage furrow during cytokinesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c134">Wang et al., 2016</xref>). The genetic interactions between mutations in the exocyst and septins when combined with TRAPP-II mutants may reflect fundamentally different consequences for compromising the exocyst function (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Tables 1</xref> and <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). In septin mutants, the exocyst complex still localizes to the division site but is mispositioned from the rim to the center of the division plane. This mislocalization allows partial retention of exocyst function, leading to very mild synthetic or additive defects when combined with compromised TRAPP-II trafficking and tethering. In contrast, in exocyst subunit mutants, the exocyst becomes partial or non-functional, resulting in a more severe loss of exocyst activity. These differing consequences could explain the qualitative differences in genetic interactions observed with TRAPP-II mutants (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Tables 1</xref> and <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Thus, septins and the exocyst also work in different genetic pathways for certain functions in fission yeast cytokinesis.</p>
<p>Fission yeast septins regulate the exocyst in specific temporal and spatial manners. They only regulate the localization of the exocyst during late stages of cytokinesis and are not responsible for its targeting to the cell tips during interphase or initial recruitment to the division site during early cytokinesis before septin appearance (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1D</xref>, 2A; Figure supplement S1, F and G; and Videos 8-10). Disruption of the contractile ring affects the localization of the exocyst to the division site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c133">Wang et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Dobbelaere and Barral, 2004</xref>). This suggests that the exocyst likely depends on the contractile ring components for initial recruitment to the division site. However, this is not a universal mechanism. The subcellular localization of the exocyst complex in rat brain cells is affected by microtubule, but not actin-disrupting drugs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c130">Vega and Hsu, 2003</xref>). Thus, how the exocyst is initially recruited to the division site remains to be studied. Since fission yeast exocyst clearly depends on septins for proper localization during late stages of cytokinesis, its localization dependence must migrate to septin rings from the contractile ring at some point before the onset of the contractile ring constriction. So it will be of great interest to examine how this transition occurs. Although septins may act as either scaffolds or diffusion barriers for Sec3 in budding yeast, Sec3 localizes between the split septin rings during cytokinesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Dobbelaere and Barral, 2004</xref>). However, in mammalian neurons, the exocyst subunits Sec6 and Sec8 colocalize with the septin SEPT7/CDC10 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Hsu et al., 1998</xref>). Thus, the colocalized septins and the exocyst in fission yeast may provide more insights in mammalian cells for understanding the molecular mechanisms of their interactions.</p>
<p>Examples of localization dependence between septins and the exocyst have been reported in other systems. The most prominent cases come from fungal pathogens (Eisermann et al., 2023). <italic>Magnaporthe oryzae</italic> infects plants through a specialized infection cell called appressorium, which breaches through the cuticle of the leaf to allow entry into plant tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Dagdas et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Gupta et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c148">Zhang et al., 2021</xref>). The exocyst assembles in appressorium at the point of plant infection in a septin-dependent manner. Septin deletion causes mislocalization of the key component for the exocyst assembly, Sec6, at the appressorium pore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Gupta et al., 2015</xref>). Similarly, the root-infecting phytopathogenic fungus <italic>Verticillium dahliae</italic> also assembles the exocyst at the penetration peg of the hyphopodium in a septin-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c152">Zhou et al., 2017</xref>). The absence of septin VdSep5 impairs the delivery of secretory proteins to the penetration interface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c152">Zhou et al., 2017</xref>). Another example is <italic>Candida albicans</italic> septins, which localize at the hyphal tips where tip growth occurs with active exocytosis in this human opportunistic pathogen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Li et al., 2007</xref>). Deletion of septin <italic>CDC10</italic> or <italic>CDC11</italic> causes mislocalization of the exocyst marked by Sec3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Li et al., 2007</xref>). Thus, one of the conserved roles of septins is to regulate the proper membrane targeting of the exocyst complex to the plasma membrane and to ensure spatiotemporal fidelity of vesicle tethering and fusion. Our current study will provide insights into how septins and the exocyst help fungal pathogens infect their hosts. However, how they physically interact with each other had not been systematically investigated.</p>

<title>The exocyst complex docks on septins on the plasma membrane through multivalent physical interactions</title>
<p>Despite the relationships between septins and the exocyst mentioned above, whether and how they physically interact with each other were obscure. In budding yeast, the exocyst subunits have been shown to interact physically with a number of proteins, including Sec15 with Rab GTPase Sec4 and type V myosin Myo2; and Sec6 with v-SNARE protein Snc2, t-SNARE protein Sec9, and Sec1/Munc18 family protein Sec1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Guo et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c119">Sivaram et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Jin et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c117">Shen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Lepore et al., 2016</xref>). The septin dynamics is essential for exocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c127">Tokhtaeva et al., 2015</xref>). But septins and the exocyst do not colocalize in budding yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Dobbelaere and Barral, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c104">Okada et al., 2013</xref>). Active Cdc42 recruits septins to the polarization site. The septin ring that is formed by polarized exocytosis corrals exocyst-dependent exocytosis and active Cdc42 inside the ring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Dobbelaere and Barral, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c104">Okada et al., 2013</xref>). However, there is no evidence that the exocyst and septins physically and directly interact in budding yeast. Consistently, recent mapped <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> protein interactome found no interactions between septins and exocyst in the pull down experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93">Michaelis et al., 2023</xref>).</p>
<p>By contrast, several interactions between septins and the exocyst have been identified by Co-IPs to support the role of septins in the regulation of the exocyst localization in other cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Hsu et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Beites et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c130">Vega and Hsu, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Li et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Gupta et al., 2015</xref>). In rat brain lysates, the septins SEPT2, 4, 6, and 7 have been shown to associate with the exocyst complex containing Sec6/8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Hsu et al., 1998</xref>). Sec6 is found to be colocalized with SEPT7 on synapse assembly sites in isolated neurons where active membrane remodeling is required (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Hsu et al., 1998</xref>). From rat brain cells, the exocyst subunits Sec8 and Exo70 along with tubulin co-immunoprecipitated with the septin Nedd5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c130">Vega and Hsu, 2003</xref>). During hyphal development in <italic>C. albicans</italic>, association of Sec3 and Sec5 with the septin Cdc3 was detected by co-IP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Li et al., 2007</xref>). In <italic>M. oryzae,</italic> mislocalization of Sec6 was reported with deletion of the septin Sep3. This was supported by pull down and mass spectrometry data where Sep4 and Sep5 were pulled down by Exo84 while Sep3 by Sec6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Gupta et al., 2015</xref>). Here we have presented comprehensive studies on explaining importance of septins in regulating exocytosis by likely direct physical interactions with the exocyst in fission yeast.</p>
<p>In our study, we systematically investigated all the potential pairwise interactions between septin and exocyst subunits using AlphFold2 predictions. We experimentally confirmed five out of the six predicted interactions by co-IPs: Spn1-Sec15, Spn1-Sec6, Spn2-Sec15, Spn2-Sec5, and Spn4-Sec15 and validated four of them by yeast two-hybrid assays (except Spn2-Sec5 due to high levels of Sec15 autoactivation). The observed associations are consistent with direct interactions predicted by AlphaFold2, but cannot alone establish their direct bindings. These multivalent interactions ensure that the exocyst dynamically tethers secretory vesicles on the plasma membrane with high temporal and spatial fidelity even individual interaction may not be very strong. The subunits Sec15, Sec6, and Sec5 in the exocyst complex are known to be available for interacting with many proteins as mentioned above in budding yeast and in other systems for different cellular functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c120">SjÃ¶linder et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Fukai et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c149">Zhang et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Feng et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Du et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Guo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c143">Yang et al., 2022</xref>). We also predicted the whole <italic>S. pombe</italic> exocyst structure using AlphaFold3, which is most likely based on the published structural models of the full exocyst complex from budding yeast (e.g., PDB: 5YFP; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Lepore et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">Mei et al., 2018</xref>). We also predicted the structures of septin octameric and hexameric complexes. We found that majority of the predicted exocyst-septin interacting residues are located on the accessible surfaces of the assembled whole complexes (Figure supplement S4 and S5; and Videos 4-7). These predictions indicate that these septin-exocyst interactions are sterically plausible. The interactions between septins and the exocyst that we identified in fission yeast will provide important insights into the mechanisms of exocyst regulations by septins. During evolution, fission yeast may have lost many but some of the most conserved aspects of septin functions including septin-exocyst interactions.</p>
<p>It is known that the octameric exocyst complex consists of two subcomplexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Heider et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Ahmed et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Lepore et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">Mei and Guo, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">Mei et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Ganesan et al., 2020</xref>). Subcomplex 1 consists of Sec3, Sec5, Sec6, and Sec8 while subcomplex 2 consists of Sec10, Sec15, Exo70, and Exo84. In our study, we found that septins can interact with both of the exocyst subcomplexes with multivalent interactions by Alphafold predictions, reciprocal Co-IPs, and yeast two-hybrid assays. Some of the identified interactions may only be strong enough between specific subunits at exposed interfaces under the Co-IP conditions, rather than through the whole complex as predicted by AlphaFold. Additionally, the detergent and salt conditions used in our co-IPs may disrupt labile complex interfaces or partially dissociate multimeric assemblies. Future studies are needed to refine the residues involved in the interactions because the predicted interacting residues from AlphaFold are too numerous. However, it is encouraging that most of the predicted interacting residues are clustered in several surface patches. Experimental validation through targeted mutagenesis is an important next step. In addition, tests are needed to figure out if posttranslational modifications are necessary for the interactions between septins and the exocyst. Because the colocalization of septins and the exocyst required for their proper function occurs at a specific stage during cytokinesis rather than a general regulation throughout the cell cycle, septin filament formation and posttranslational modifications of the involved proteins are most likely required, which make it challenging to tease out the interactions in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Dobbelaere et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">HernÃ¡ndez-RodrÃ­guez and Momany, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c111">Ren and Guo, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c124">Tay et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c115">Sharma and Menon, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c137">Werner and Yadav, 2023</xref>). Moreover, we cannot rule out that Rho1/RhoA GTPase and PI(4,5)P2 are involved in septin-exocyst interactions as both have been reported to interact with septins and/or the exocyst in other cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Guo et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">He et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Bertin et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Bendezu and Martin, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c109">Perez et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Carim and Hickson, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c113">Safavian et al., 2023</xref>).</p>
<p>In summary, we found that septins are important for exocyst targeting to the division site during late stages of cytokinesis through multivalent interactions between their subunits. The proper exocyst localization at the rim of the division plane is critical for timely and successful cytokinesis. Our results will provide insights into future studies of the interactions and functions of both septins and the exocyst in other cell types. Dysregulation of septins or the exocyst leads to severe disorders including neurological diseases and cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c112">Russell and Hall, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">Martin-Urdiroz et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Halim et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c137">Werner and Yadav, 2023</xref>). Thus, it is important to identify the functional and physical links between septins and the exocyst complex in human cells.</p>

<p>Cells were normally grown at the exponential phase in YE5S liquid medium at 25Â°C for 40-48 h before microscopy or temperature shift.

Then the intensity in a second ROI2 approximately twice the area of ROI1 (including ROI1) was measured and used to subtract cytoplasmic background as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Coffman et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Davidson et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Davidson et al., 2016</xref>).</p>
<p>For comparing the colocalization at the rim of the division plane (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>), a line along the cell long-axis was drawn across the division plane at the same position for both Spn1 and Sec3 channels using maximum intensity projection images. Then the width of the line was adjusted to cover all signals at the division site, generating an ROI of 1.5 Î¼m x 3.5 Î¼m (x-y) (see <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). The mean intensity of all pixels in y-axis was measured along x-axis and plotted.</p>
<p>Line scans (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figures 6D</xref>, 7A, and 7C) across the division plane were made in the middle focal plane of the fluorescence images. A line along the cell short-axis was drawn across the division plane of the cells with a closed septum (at or after the end of contractile-ring constriction) to cover the whole cell diameter. To quantify their fluorescence intensity at the division site using line scans, the line width used was 3 pixels to reduce signal variations caused by measurements on a single focal plane. Mean intensity (average of 3 pixels) was measured across cell diameter. For Syb1 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D</xref>), cells at the end of ring constriction (indicated by an Rlc1 dot at the center of the division plane) were measured; and line scans were aligned by referencing the peak intensity of Rlc1 signal. All data were aligned by the center and plotted. For Bgs1 (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A</xref>), we quantified the cells that Rlc1 signal had disappeared from the division site. The line was drawn in the Bgs1 channel in the middle focal plane. The center of line scan was defined as the pixel with the brightest Bgs1 value. All data were aligned by the center and plotted. For Eng1 (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7C</xref>), cells with closed septa were measured; and line scans for WT cells were aligned by the middle of the two peaks; and the ones for <italic>spn1</italic>Î cells were aligned by referencing the middle of septa in DIC images.</p>

Five pre-bleach images and 150 post-bleach images for <italic>spn1</italic>Î cells, or 70 post-bleach images for <italic>sec3-913</italic> cells, were collected at every 0.33 s or 10 s, respectively. For image analysis, the background and photobleaching during image acquisition were corrected using empty space and unbleached cells within the same image. The pre-bleach intensity was normalized to 100%, and the first post-bleach intensity was normalized to 0% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Laporte et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c153">Zhu et al., 2018</xref>). Intensities of three consecutive post-bleach time points were rolling averaged to reduce noise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c129">Vavylonis et al., 2008</xref>).

<title>Predictions of septin-exocyst interactions using AlphaFold analyses</title>
<p>The development of computer algorithms to predict three-dimensional protein structures from amino acid sequence involves two complementary ways that concentrate on either the physical interactions or the evolutionary history (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Jumper et al., 2021</xref>). AlphaFold utilizes cutting-edge neural network topologies and training techniques to predict the 3D coordinates of a primary amino acid sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Jumper et al., 2021</xref>). We made the AlphaFold models of interactions between different septin and exocyst subunits using Google Colab Platform and AlphaFold2_advanced option that does not need templates at: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/sokrypton/ColabFold/blob/main/beta/AlphaFold2_advanced.ipynb#scrollTo=ITcPnLkLuDDE">https://colab.research.google.com/github/sokrypton/ColabFold/blob/main/beta/AlphaFold2_advanced.ipynb#scrollTo=ITcPnLkLuDDE</ext-link>. Sequences of each subunit were searched against genetic databases with msa_method = mmseqs2, pair_mode = unpaired. The default mode of sampling options was used; num_models = 5, ptm option, num_ensemble = 1, max_cycles = 3, num_samples = 1. Total 5 models were ranked according to their Predicted Local-Distance Difference Test (pLDDT) score between 0 to 100, from low to high confidence level. Septin and exocyst subunits were input in 1:1 ratio. For each of the 32 pairs of septin and exocyst subunits, the protein sequences were entered in both orders (for example, Spn1:Sec3 and Sec3:Spn1). We found that the order of input sequence affects some prediction results. So we predicted all septin-exocyst combinations in both input sequence orders. We then selected the top septin-exocyst combinations that showed interactions in both input orders. The structural figures were drawn with PyMOL version 2.0 (Schrodinger, Inc.).</p>
<p>We used AlphaFold3 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://alphafoldserver.com/">https://alphafoldserver.com/</ext-link>) to predict the structures of fission yeast exocyst complex and septin hexamer/octamer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Abramson et al., 2024</xref>). To predict the structure of whole exocyst complex, we trimmed some of the exocyst subunits to meet the 5,000-residue limit of AlphaFold3 based on the budding yeast cryo-EM structure of exocyst complex (PDB: 5YFP, 4.4 â« resolution) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">Mei et al., 2018</xref>). The truncations were selected so that they do not interfere with inter-subunit interactions as well as with septin binding based on our modeling. Sequences of all subunits of the respective complexes were used as input and models were generated using the default settings. Top ranked models based on PAE, pTM, and iPTM were analyzed in PyMol. Different subunits were colored distinctly to differentiate the interface. To evaluate accessibility of residues, surface exposure of predicted interacting residues was mapped onto the corresponding residues in the final models and colored yellow to visualize distinctly.</p>

<title>Co-IP and Western blotting</title>
<p>We carried out Co-IP and Western blotting as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Laporte et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Lee and Wu, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c144">Ye et al., 2012</xref>). Briefly, mEGFP, GFP, mYFP, or 13Myc tagged septin or exocyst subunits were expressed under native promotors in fission yeast. Cells were grown in YE5S liquid medium at 25Â°C for â¼48 h before harvesting and lyophilization. Lyophilized cells (200 mg) were ground into a homogeneous fine powder using pestles and mortars. IP buffer (50 mM 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid [HEPES], pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.1% NP-40, 50 mM NaF, 20 mM glycerophosphate, 0.1 mM Na<sub>3</sub>VO<sub>4</sub>, 1 mM PMSF, and protease inhibitor [Roche] 1 tablet/30 ml buffer) was added according to the ratio of 10 Âµl : 1 mg lyophilized cell powder. 60 Âµl Dynabeads protein G beads (Invitrogen) were incubated with 5 Âµg polyclonal GFP antibody (Novus Bio) for 1 h at room temperature. After three washes with PBS and one wash with 1 ml IP buffer, the beads were incubated with cell lysate for 2 h at 4Â°C. After 5 washes at 4Â°C with 1 ml IP buffer each time, proteins were eluted by boiling with 80 Âµl sample buffer. The protein samples were separated with SDS-PAGE gel and detected with monoclonal anti-GFP antibody (1:1,000 dilution; 11814460001; Roche, Mannheim, Germany), monoclonal anti-Myc antibody (1:500 dilution, 9E10, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX), and anti-tubulin TAT1 antibody at 1:10,000 dilution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c139">Woods et al., 1989</xref>).

Briefly, yeast cells were grown at 25Â°C for â¼41 h in YE5S medium and then shifted to 36Â°C for 4 h before harvesting using Millipore filters. Samples were prepared using high-pressure freezing with a Wohlwend Compact 02 Freezer in the presence of 2% osmium tetroxide and 0.1% uranyl acetate in acetone. Thin sections with a thickness of 70 nm were cut and embedded in Epon-Araldite epoxy resin, which were post stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate. Imaging of EM samples was done using a Philips CM100 transmission electron microscope (FEI, Hillsboro, OR).</p>

<title>Yeast two hybrid assays</title>
<p>Yeast two hybrid assays were performed as described previously using X-gal overlay and Î²-D-galactosidase activity quantifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Amberg et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c107">Paiano et al., 2019</xref>). DNA or cDNA (for genes with introns) sequences of Spn1, Spn1(aa 300-469), Spn2, Spn4, Sec5, Sec6, and Sec15 were cloned into pVP16 or pGBT9 vectors having VP16 transcription activation domain (AD) or GAL4 transcription factor DNA-binding domain (BD), respectively. Constructed plasmids were confirmed by restriction digestions and Sanger sequencing. Pairs of plasmids were then co-transformed into <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> strain MAV203 (11281-011; Invitrogen) and plated on synthetic drop-out medium lacking leucine and tryptophan (SD-L-W) for selection. For X-gal overlay assay, grown colonies were re-streaked on YPD (yeast extract-peptone-dextrose) plates to grow overnight. We used 10-12 ml chloroform per plate to permeabilize cells for 10 min and then dried for 10 additional min. 0.5% agarose was prepared in 25 ml PBS (pH 7.5) and 500 Âµl X-gal (20 mg/ml stock in DMSO) was added after cooling. After mixing thoroughly, agarose containing X-gal was overlaid onto the colonies and incubated at 30Â°C. Plates were checked every 30 min for development of blue color.</p>
<p>Interactions were then quantified by Î²-D-galactosidase activity using the <italic>o</italic>-nitrophenylâ Î²-D-galactopyranoside (ONPG) assay (48712-M; Sigma Aldrich) according to the published methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Amberg et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c107">Paiano et al., 2019</xref>). For interactions between Sec15 with Spn1, Spn2, and Spn4, the Amberg et al. method was used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Amberg et al., 2006</xref>). Briefly, cells were grown in SD-L-W liquid medium at 30Â°C overnight. 40 ml culture with OD<sub>595</sub> &gt;1 was collected and washed with 1 ml distilled water. Then cells were broken in 110 Âµl breaking buffer (100 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 1 mM DTT, and 20% glycerol) using glass beads on bead beater. 10 Âµl of the lysate was diluted with 90 Âµl distilled water and spun down to remove cell debris, and the supernatant was used to estimate protein concentration by Bradford assay. To the remaining 100 Âµl of lysate, 0.9 ml Z-buffer (100 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, 10 mM KCl, and 2 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub>) and 0.2 ml ONPG (8 mg/1 ml Z buffer) were added and incubated at 28Â°C until pale yellow color developing in at least one of the samples. All the reactions were stopped by adding 0.4 ml 1 M Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>. Debris were removed by centrifuging at 15,700 g for 10 min and OD<sub>420</sub> was measured using 1 ml of supernatant. Time elapsed from adding ONPG to adding stop solution was recorded and activity of Î²-galactosidase was calculated using the formula:</p>
<p>Î²-galactosidase activity (nmol/min/mg) = OD<sub>420</sub> Ã 1.7/ [0.0045 Ã protein (mg/ml) Ã extract volume (ml) Ã time (min)]</p>
<p>For the interaction between Spn1 and Sec6, the Painano et al. method was used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c107">Paiano et al., 2019</xref>). Briefly, cultures were diluted to OD<sub>595</sub> = 0.30 and incubated for 2 h at 30Â°C. For each sample, cells from 9 ml culture were collected and washed with 1 ml Z buffer and then resuspended in 0.1 ml Z buffer. Cells were broken by three freeze-thaw cycles in liquid nitrogen. 0.7 ml Z buffer with Î²-mercaptoethanol (27 Âµl Î²-mercaptoethanol in 9.973 ml Z buffer) and 160 Âµl ONPG was added to the cell lysates and incubated at 30Â°C until a yellow color developing in at least one of the samples. Reactions were stopped by adding 0.4 ml 1 M Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>. Debris were removed by centrifuging at 15,700 g for 10 min and OD<sub>420</sub> was measured using 1 ml supernatant. Time elapsed from adding ONPG to adding stop solution was recorded and Î²-galactosidase activity were calculated using the following formula: Î²-galactosidase Units = 1000 Ã OD<sub>420</sub>/ [T Ã V Ã OD<sub>595</sub>], where T is the elapsed time (minutes), V is the volume (ml) of culture used, and OD595 is the optical density of yeast culture.</p>

<p>How secretion is regulated during cell division and how membrane trafficking factors cooperate with the cytoskeleton during cell division remain poorly understood.

The work provides a <bold>valuable</bold> body of new information that will be of great interest to the cell biology community. The evidence is <bold>solid</bold> and provides the authors and the community a framework to test if the identified interfaces reflect bona fide interaction sites in vivo and in vitro in future.</p>

<p>Summary</p>
<p>In this manuscript, Singh, Wu and colleagues explore functional links between septins and the exocyst complex. The exocyst in a conserved octameric complex that mediates the tethering of secretory vesicles for exocytosis in eukaryotes. In fission yeast cells, the exocyst is necessary for cell division, where it localizes mostly at the rim of the division plane, but septins, which localize in a similar manner, are non-essential. The main findings of the work are that septins are required for the specific localization of the exocyst to the rim of the division plane, and the likely consequent localization of the glucanase Eng1 at this same location, where it is known to promote cell separation. In absence of septins, the exocyst still localizes to the division plane, but is not restricted to the rim. They also show some defect in the localization of secretory vesicles and glucan synthase cargo. They further show interactions between septins and exocyst subunits through coIP experiments.</p>
<p>Strengths</p>
<p>The septin, exocyst and Eng1 localization data are well supported, showing that the septin rim recruits the exocyst and (likely consequently) the Eng1 glucanase at this location. One important finding of the manuscript is that of a physical interaction between septins and exocyst subunits in co-immunoprecipitation experiments.</p>
<p>Weaknesses</p>
<p>While interactions are supported by coIP experiments, the AlphaFold-predicted septin-exocyst interactions are not very convincing and the predicted binding interfaces are not supported by mutation analysis. A further open question is whether septins interact with the intact exocyst complex or whether the interactions occur only with individual subunits. The two-hybrid and coIP data only show weak interactions with individual subunits, and some coIPs (for instance Sec3 and Exo70 with Spn1 and Spn4) are negative, suggesting that the exocyst complex may not remain intact in these experiments.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This interesting study implicates the direct interaction between two multi-subunit complexes, known as the exocyst and septin complexes, in the function of both complexes during cytokinesis in fission yeast. While previous work from several labs had implicated roles for the exocyst and septin complexes in cytokinesis and cell separation, this study describes the importance of protein:protein interaction between these complexes in mediating the functions of these complexes in cytokinesis. Previous studies in neurons had suggested interactions between septins and exocyst complexes occur but the functional importance of such interactions was not known. Moreover, in baker's yeast where both of these complexes have been extensively studied - no evidence of such an interaction has been uncovered despite numerous studies which should have detected it. Therefore while exocyst:septin interactions appear to be conserved in several systems, it appears likely that budding yeast are the exception--having lost this conserved interaction.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The strengths of this work include the rigorous analysis of the interaction using multiple methods including Co-IP of tagged but endogenously expressed proteins, 2 hybrid interaction, and Alphafold Multimer. Careful quantitative analysis of the effects of loss of function in each complex and the effects on localization and dynamics of each complex was also a strength. Taken together this work convincingly describes that these two complexes do interact and that this interaction plays an important role in post Golgi vesicle targeting during cytokinesis.</p>
<p>Comments on revisions:</p>
<p>The authors have added substantial work to the revised manuscript, and it is much improved. In particular, the figures portraying the AlphaFold Multimer model of the exocyst:septin interactions are much clearer. I also appreciate the effort that went into modeling the fission yeast exocyst complex based on the yeast CryoEM structure in order to determine if the predicted interfaces with septins were likely to be surface accessible in the intact exocyst complex.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this manuscript, Singh, Wu and colleagues explore functional links between septins and the exocyst complex. The exocyst in a conserved octameric complex that mediates the tethering of secretory vesicles for exocytosis in eukaryotes. In fission yeast cells, the exocyst is necessary for cell division, where it localizes mostly at the rim of the division plane, but septins, which localize in a similar manner, are non-essential. The main findings of the work are that septins are required for the specific localization of the exocyst to the rim of the division plane, and the likely consequent localization of the glucanase Eng1 at this same location, where it is known to promote cell separation. In the absence of septins, the exocyst still localizes to the division plane but is not restricted to the rim. They also show some defects in the localization of secretory vesicles and glucan synthase cargo. They further propose that interactions between septins and exocysts are direct, as shown through Alphafold2 predictions (of unclear strength) and clean coIP experiments.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The septin, exocyst and Eng1 localization data are well supported, showing that the septin rim recruits the exocyst and (likely consequently) the Eng1 glucanase at this location. One major finding of the manuscript is that of a physical interaction between septins and exocyst subunits. Indeed, many of the coIPs supporting this discovery are very clear.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>I am less convinced by the strength of the physical interaction of septins with the exocyst complex. Notably, one important open question is whether septins interact with the intact exocyst complex, as claimed in the text, or whether the interactions occur only with individual subunits. The two-hybrid and coIP data only show weak interactions with individual subunits, and some coIPs (for instance Sec3 and Exo70 with Spn1 and Spn4) are negative, suggesting that the exocyst complex does not remain intact in these experiments.</p>
<p>Given the known structure of the full exocyst complex and septin filaments (at least in S. cerevisiae), the Alphafold2 predicted structure could be used to probe whether the proposed interaction sites are compatible with full complex formation.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for these important and insightful comments. We agree that our current data, particularly the data from yeast two-hybrid and co-immunoprecipitation (coIP) assays, primarily reveal interactions between individual septin and exocyst subunits, and do not conclusively demonstrate binding of septins to the fully assembled exocyst complex. We realize this as a key limitation and have revised the manuscript text accordingly to clarify this point.</p>
<p>We also appreciate the reviewerâs suggestion to use structural prediction to further assess their interaction plausibility. We have now employed the full Saccharomyces cerevisiae exocyst complex (with 4.4 â« resolution) published by the Guo group (Mei et al., 2018) to examine the interfaces of septin and the exocyst interactions, assuming that the S. pombe exocyst has the similar structure. We focused on checking all the interacting residues on the exocyst complex and septins from our AlphaFold modeling to determine whether these predicted interactions are structurally compatible. Our analysis reveals that majority subunit interactions are sterically feasible, while a few would likely require partial disassembly or flexible conformations. These new insights have been added to the revised Results and Discussion sections (Figure Supplement S4, S5 and Videos 4-7).</p>
<p>While we cannot fully resolve whether septins engage with the whole exocyst complex versus selected subunits, our combined data support a model that septins scaffold or spatially regulate the exocyst localization at the division site, potentially through dynamic and multivalent interactions. We now explicitly state this more cautious interpretation in the revised manuscript.</p>

<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The effect of spn1â on Eng1 localization is very clear, but the effect on secretory vesicles (Ypt3, Syb1) and glucan synthase Bgs1 is less convincing. The effect is small, and it is not clear how the cells are matched for the stage of cytokinesis.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>For localizations and quantifications of Eng1, Ypt3, Syb1, and Bgs1 shown in Figures 6 and 7, cells with a closed septum (at or after the end of contractile-ring constriction) were quantified or highlighted. To quantify their fluorescence intensity at the division site using line scan, the line width used was 3 pixels. For Syb1 (Figure 6D), we quantified cells at the end of ring constriction (when Rlc1-tdTomato constricted to a dot) in the middle focal plane. The exact same lines were drawn in both Rlc1 and Syb1 channels. The center of line scan was defined as the pixel with the brightest Rlc1 value. All data were aligned by the center and plotted. For Bgs1 (Figure 7A), we quantified the cells that Rlc1 signal had disappeared from the division site. The line was drawn in the Bgs1 channel in the middle focal plane. The center of line scan was defined as the pixel with the brightest Bgs1 value.</p>
<p>All data were aligned by the center and plotted. These details were added to the Materials and Methods.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This interesting study implicates the direct interaction between two multi-subunit complexes, known as the exocyst and septin complexes, in the function of both complexes during cytokinesis in fission yeast. While previous work from several labs had implicated roles for the exocyst and septin complexes in cytokinesis and cell separation, this study describes the importance of protein:protein interaction between these complexes in mediating the functions of these complexes in cytokinesis. Previous studies in neurons had suggested interactions between septins and exocyst complexes occur but the functional importance of such interactions was not known. Moreover, in baker's yeast where both of these complexes have been extensively studied - no evidence of such an interaction has been uncovered despite numerous studies which should have detected it. Therefore while exocyst:septin interactions appear to be conserved in several systems, it appears likely that budding yeast are the exception--having lost this conserved interaction.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The strengths of this work include the rigorous analysis of the interaction using multiple methods including Co-IP of tagged but endogenously expressed proteins, 2 hybrid interaction, and Alphafold Multimer. Careful quantitative analysis of the effects of loss of function in each complex and the effects on localization and dynamics of each complex was also a strength. Taken together this work convincingly describes that these two complexes do interact and that this interaction plays an important role in post Golgi vesicle targeting during cytokinesis.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The authors used Alphafold Multimer to predict (largely successfully) which subunits were most likely to be involved in direct interactions between the complexes. It would be very interesting to compare this to a parallel analysis on the budding yeast septin and exocyst complexes where it is quite clear that detectable interactions between the exocyst and septins (using the same methods) do not exist. Presumably the resulting pLDDT scores will be significantly lower. These are in silico experiments and should not be difficult to carry out.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for this insightful suggestion. To assess the specificity of the predicted interactions between septins and the exocyst complex in S. pombe, we performed a comparative AlphaFold2 analysis using some of the homologous subunits from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We modeled two interactions between Cdc10-Sec5 and Cdc10-Sec15 (Cdc10 is the Spn2 homolog) using the same pipeline and parameters at the time when we did the modeling for S. pombe. We did not find interactions between them using the criteria we used for the fission yeast proteins in this study. These results support the notion that the predicted septinâexocyst interactions in S. pombe are not generalizable to budding yeast. Unfortunately, we did not test all other combinations at that time and the AlphaFold2 platform is not available to us now (showing system error messages when we tried recently). We thank the reviewer again for this helpful suggestion, which should strengthen the evolutionary interpretation of the septin-exocyst interactions once it is able to be systematically carried out.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Septins in several systems are thought to guide the location of exocytosis, and they have been found to interact with the exocyst vesicle-tethering complex in some cells. However, it is not known whether such interactions are direct or indirect. Moreover, septin-exocyst physical associations were not detected in several other systems, including yeasts, making it unclear whether such interactions reflect a conserved septin-exocytosis link or whether they may missed if they depend on septin polymerization or association into higher-order structures. Singh et. al., set out to define whether and how septins influence the exocyst during S. pombe cytokinesis. Based on three lines of evidence, the authors conclude that septins directly bind to exocyst subunits to regulate localization of the exocyst and vesicle secretion during cytokinesis. The conclusions are consistent with the data presented, but some interpretations need to be clarified and extended:</p>
<p>(1) The first line of evidence examines septin and exocyst localization during cytokinesis in wild-type and septin-mutant or exocyst-mutant yeast. Quantitative imaging convincingly shows that the detailed localization of the exocyst at the division site is perturbed in septin mutants, and that this is accompanied by modest accumulation of vesicles and vesicle cargos. Whether that is sufficient to explain the increased thickness of the division septum in septin mutants remains unclear.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The modest accumulation of vesicles and vesicle cargos at the division site is one of the reasons for the increased thickness of the division septum in septin mutants. It is more likely that the misplaced exocyst can still tether vesicles along the division plane (less likely at the rim) without septins. Due to the lack of the glucanase Eng1 at the rim of the division plane in septin mutants, daughter-cell separation is delayed and then cells continue to thicken the septum. We have added these points to the Discussion.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) The second line of evidence involves a comprehensive Alphafold2 analysis of potential pair-wise interactions between septin and exocyst subunits. This identifies several putative interactions in silico, but it is unclear whether the identified interaction surfaces would be available in the full septin or exocyst complexes.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for raising this important point. We fully agree that a key limitation of pairwise AlphaFold predictions is that they do not account for the higher-order structural context of multimeric protein complexes, such as septin hetero-oligomers or the assembled exocyst complex. As a result, some of the predicted interfaces could indeed be conformationally restricted in the native state.</p>
<p>To address this concern, we predicted the S. pombe exocyst and septin structures using AlphaFold3. We mapped predicted contact residues onto the predicted structure. Most predicted interfaces (86% for the exocyst and 86-96% for septins) appear to be located on accessible surfaces in the assembled complexes (Figure supplement S4, S5, videos 4 - video 7), suggesting that these interactions are sterically plausible. We have added this important caveat to the text of the revised manuscript highlighting the interface accessibility within the assembled complexes. We appreciate the reviewerâs insight, which helped us strengthen the interpretation and limitations of the AlphaFold-based analysis.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) The third line of evidence uses co-immunoprecipitation and yeast two hybrid assays to show that several physical interactions predicted by Alphafold2 can be detected, leading the authors to conclude that they have identified direct interactions. However, both methods leave open the possibility that the interactions are indirect and mediated by other proteins in the fission yeast extract (co-IP) or budding yeast cell (two-hybrid).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for this important clarification. We agree that coimmunoprecipitation (co-IP) and yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) assays cannot conclusively distinguish between direct and indirect interactions. As the reviewer points out, co-IPs may reflect associations mediated by bridging proteins within the fission yeast extract, and Y2H readouts can be influenced by fusion context or endogenous host proteins. In our manuscript, we have now revised the relevant statements in the Results and Discussion sections to clarify that the observed associations are consistent with direct interactions predicted by AlphaFold2, but cannot alone establish direct binding. We have also tempered our terminologyâsubstituting phrases such as âdirect interactionâ with âphysical association consistent with direct binding,â where appropriate.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) Based on prior studies it would be expected that the large majority of both septins and exocyst subunits are present in cells and extracts as stoichiometric complexes. Thus, one would expect any septin-exocyst interaction to yield associations detectable with multiple subunits, yet co-IPs were not detected in some combinations. It is therefore unclear whether the interactions reflect associations between fully-formed functional complexes or perhaps between transient folding intermediates.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for this thoughtful observation. We agree that both septins and exocyst subunits are generally understood to exist in cells as stable, stoichiometric complexes, and that interactions between fully assembled complexes might be expected to yield co-immunoprecipitation signals involving multiple subunits from each complex. However, it was also found that &gt;50% of septins Spn1 and Spn4 are in the cytoplasm even during cytokinesis when the septin double rings are formed (Table 1 of Wu and Pollard, Science 2005, PMID: 16224022). Thus, it is possible that there are pools of free septin and exocyst subunits in the cytoplasm, which were detected in our Co-IP assays.</p>
<p>In our experiments, we observed selective co-IP signals between certain septin and exocyst subunits, while other combinations did not yield detectable interactions. We believe these findings could reflect several other possibilities besides the possible interactions among the free subunits in the cytoplasm:</p>
<p>(1) Some interactions may only be strong enough between specific subunits at exposed interfaces under the Co-IP conditions, rather than through wholesome complexâcomplex interactions;</p>
<p>(2) The detergent and/or salt conditions used in our co-IPs may disrupt labile complex interfaces or partially dissociate multimeric assemblies.</p>
<p>To address this concern, we now include in the Discussion a paragraph highlighting the possibility that some of the observed interactions may not reflect binding between fully assembled, functional complexes. Notably, most detected interactions pairs are consistent with the AlphaFold predictions, which suggest specific subunit interfaces may be responsible for mediating contact. While we cannot fully resolve whether septins engage with the whole exocyst complex versus selected subunits, our combined data supports a model that septins scaffold or spatially regulate the exocyst localization at the division site, potentially through dynamic and multivalent interactions. We now explicitly state this more cautious interpretation in the revised manuscript. Future biochemical studies using native complex purifications, cross-linking mass spectrometry, or in vitro reconstitution with fully assembled septin and exocyst complexes, or in vivo FRET assays will be essential to clarify whether the interactions we observe occur between intact assemblies or intermediate forms.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the Authors):</bold></p>
<p>A major finding from the manuscript is the description of physical interaction of septin subunits with exocyst subunits. The analysis starts from Alphafold2 predictions, shown in Figures 3 and S3. However, some of the most useful metrics of Alphafold, the PAE plot and the pTM and ipTM values, are not provided. It is thus very difficult to estimate the value of the predicted structures (which are also obscured by all side chains). The power of a predicted structure is that it suggests binding interfaces, which is not explored here. At the very least, it would not be difficult to examine whether the proposed binding interfaces are free in the septin filaments and octameric exocyst complex.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Please also see response to reviewer #1 (Public Review).</p>
<p>We thank the reviewer for these very helpful suggestions. We agree that inclusion of AlphaFold2 model confidence metricsâspecifically the Predicted Aligned Error (PAE) plots, as well as pTM and ipTM valuesâis essential for evaluating the reliability of the predicted septinâexocyst interfaces.</p>
<p>In the revised manuscript, we have now included the PAE plots (Figure 3 and Supplementary S3) and summarizes the pTM scores for each predicted septinâexocyst subunit pair. We also provide a short description of these metrics in the figure legend to help guide interpretation. The old Alphafold2 version (alphafold2advanced) that we used doesnât give iPTM score, so are not included. However, according to our methodology, we only counted the interacting residues which have pLDDT scores &gt;50%, predicting the resulting iPTM score should not be very weak.</p>
<p>In addition, we have updated Figures 3 and S3 to show simplified ribbon diagrams of the interface regions, with side chains hidden by default and selectively displayed only at predicted interaction hotspots. This improves structural clarity and makes the interface regions easier to interpret. We mentioned in the Discussion that the preliminary studies show that the predicted interacting interfaces of Sec15 and Sec5 with septin subunits are accessible for interaction in the whole exocyst complex. The new Figure Supplement S4 and S5 and Videos 4-7 now show the interface residues of both the exocyst and septins that are involved in the interactions.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Two further points on the interaction:</p>
<p>The 2H interaction data is not very convincing. The insets showing beta-gal assays do not look very different from the negative control (compare for instance in panel 4E the Sec15BD alone, last column, with the Sec15-BD in combination with Spn4-AD, third column: roughly same color), which suggests it is mostly driven by autoactivation of Sec15-BD. Providing growth information in addition to beta-gal may be helpful.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the reviewerâs close evaluation of the yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) assay data, and we agree that the signals observed in the Spn4âSec15 combination is indeed weak. Unfortunately, we did not perform growth assays. However, we would like to clarify that this is consistent with the nature of the interactions that we are investigating. The interaction between individual septin and exocyst subunits is not strong and/or transient as supported by the weak interactions by Co-IP experiments. Given the exocyst only tethers/docks vesicles on the plasma membrane for tens of seconds before vesicle fusion, the multivalent interactions between septins and the exocyst should be very dynamic and not be too strong.</p>
<p>As evidenced by our Co-IP experiments and multivalent interactions predicted by Alphafold2, the interaction between Spn4 and Sec15 is detectable but weak, suggesting that this may be a low-affinity or transient interaction. Given that Y2H assays have known limitations in detecting such low-affinity interactionsâespecially those that depend on conformational context or are not optimal in the yeast nucleusâit is perhaps not surprising that the X-gal color development is subtle. These limitations of the Y2H system have been well-documented (e.g., Braun et al., 2009; Vidal &amp; Fields, 2014), particularly for interactions with affinities in the micromolar range or those requiring conformational specificity. Therefore, the weak signal observed is in line with expectations for a lowaffinity, transient interaction such as between Spn4 and Sec15.</p>

<p>In the coIP experiments, I am confused by the presence of tubulin signal in some of the IPs. For instance, in Fig 4B, but not 4D, where the same Sec15-GFP is immunoprecipitated. There is also a signal in 4C but not 4A. This needs to be clarified.</p>

<p>The presence of tubulin in some immunoprecipitates is not unexpected, particularly in experiments involving cytoskeleton-associated proteins such as septins and exocyst subunits.

The CRAPome database and quantitative interactomics studies highlight tubulin as one of the most common background proteins in affinity-based workflows.

<p>Regarding the localization of Ypt3 and Syb1 in WT and spn1â in Figure 6C-D and Bgs1 in Figure 7A, it would help to add a contractile ring marker to be able to match the timing of cytokinesis between WT and mutants and ensure that cells of same stage are compared (and add some quantification for Ypt3). In fact, in Figure 7A, next to the cells being pointed at, there are very similar localizations of Bgs1 in WT and spn1â at the rim of the ingressing septum, which makes me wonder how the quantified cells were chosen.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>For localizations and quantifications of Eng1, Ypt3, Syb1, and Bgs1 shown in Figures 6 and 7, cells with a closed septum (at or after the end of contractile-ring constriction) were quantified or highlighted. To quantify their fluorescence intensity at the division site using line scan, the line width used was 3 pixels. For Syb1 (Figure 6D), we quantified cells at the end of ring constriction (when Rlc1-tdTomato constricted to a dot) in the middle focal plane. The exact same lines were drawn in both Rlc1 and Syb1 channels. The center of line scan was defined as the pixel with the brightest Rlc1 value. All data were aligned by the center and plotted. For Bgs1 (Figure 7A), we quantified the cells that Rlc1 signal had disappeared from the division site. The line was drawn in the Bgs1 channel in the middle focal plane. The center of line scan was defined as the pixel with the brightest Bgs1 value. All data were aligned by the center and plotted. These details were added to the Materials and Methods.</p>

<p>Because the binding interfaces are added, we keep the original Figures 3 and S3. The experiments in Figure 5 could not be performed before the interaction tests between septins and the exocyst. Thus, to aid the flow of the story, we keep Figures 2 and 5 separated.</p>

<p>We agree that the sentence in question may have overstated the functional implications of colocalization too early in the Results section, before presenting supporting evidence.

We have revised the sentence to more accurately reflect the observational nature of the data at this stage in the manuscript as below:</p>

<p>In addition to the issues noted in the public review, there were some confusing findings and references to previous literature that merit further consideration or discussion:</p>
<p>â¢ The current gold standard for validating Alphafold predictions involves making targeted mutants suggested by the structural predictions. The absence of any such validation weakens the conclusions significantly.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree that the targeted mutagenesis based on AlphaFold2-predicted interaction interfaces represents a powerful approach to experimentally validate the in silico models. While we did not pursue structure-guided mutagenesis in this study, our goal was to identify putative interactions between septin and exocyst subunits as a foundation for future functional work. Our current conclusions are intentionally limited to proposing putative interfaces, supported by co-immunoprecipitation and genetic interaction data.</p>
<p>We recognize that direct validation of specific contact residues would significantly strengthen the model. Accordingly, we have revised the Discussion to explicitly state this limitation and to note that structure-based mutagenesis will be an important next step to test the functional relevance of predicted interactions. We have added the following statement:</p>
<p>âFuture studies are needed to refine the residues involved in the interactions because the predicted interacting residues from AlphaFold are too numerous. However, it is encouraging that most of the predicted interacting residues are clustered in several surface patches.

<p>â¢ Much of the writing appears to imply that differences in mutant phenotypes indicate differences in septin (or exocyst) subunit behaviors/functions. However, my reading of the work in budding yeast is that such differences reflect the partial functionality that can be conferred by aberrant partial septin complexes that assemble and may polymerize in mutants lacking different subunits. In this view, which is supported by data showing that essentially all septins are in stoichiometric octameric complexes in cells, the wild-type functions are all mediated by the full complex. Similarly, the separate exocyst subunit localizations based on tagged Sec3 (Finger et al) were not supported by later work from the Brennwald lab with untagged Sec3, and the idea that different exocyst subunits may function separately from the full complex has very limited support in yeast. I would suggest that the text be edited to better reflect the literature, or that different views be better justified.</p>

<p>â¢ The different genetic interactions between septin and exocyst mutants when combined with TRAPP-II mutants merits further discussion: might the difference reflect relocation of exocyst from rim to center in septin mutants versus inactivation of exocyst in exocyst mutants?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate this insightful comment and agree that this distinction is likely meaningful. The reviewer correctly notes that septin mutants may not abolish exocyst function but rather cause its spatial mislocalization: from the rim to the center of the division site, whereas the exocyst mutants likely result in partial or complete loss of vesicle tethering activity at the plasma membrane.</p>
<p>To address this important nuance, we have expanded the Discussion as follows:</p>
<p>âThe genetic interactions between mutations in the exocyst and septins when combined with TRAPP-II mutants may reflect fundamentally different consequences for compromising the exocyst function (Tables 1 and 2). In septin mutants, the exocyst complex still localizes to the division site but is mispositioned from the rim to the center of the division plane. This mislocalization allows partial retention of exocyst function, leading to very mild synthetic or additive defects when combined with compromised TRAPP-II trafficking and tethering. In contrast, in exocyst subunit mutants, the exocyst becomes partial or non-functional, resulting in a more severe loss of exocyst activity. These differing consequences could explain the qualitative differences in genetic interactions observed with TRAPP-II mutants (Tables 1 and 2). Thus, septins and the exocyst also work in different genetic pathways for certain functions in fission yeast cytokinesis.â</p>

<p>We thank the reviewer for this important point. We agree that the modest vesicle accumulation observed in septin mutants suggests that a significant proportion of vesicles continue to successfully fuse at the division site, even in the absence of fully functional septin structures.</p>
<p>We now discuss this in greater detail in the revised manuscript:</p>
<p>âThe relatively modest vesicle accumulation in septin mutants suggests that septins are not absolutely required for vesicle tethering or fusion per se at the division site. Instead, septins primarily function to spatially organize the targeting sites of exocyst-directed vesicles by stabilizing the localization of the exocyst at the rim of the cleavage furrow. In septin mutants, mislocalization of the exocyst reduces the spatial precision of membrane insertion but still permits vesicle tethering and fusion, albeit in a less controlled manner. Thus, septins likely play a modulatory rather than essential role in exocytic vesicle delivery during cytokinesis. This interpretation aligns with our localization and genetic interaction data, which indicates that septins act as scaffolds to optimize secretion geometry, rather than as core components of the fusion machinery.â</p>

<p>â¢ It was unclear to this reader why relocation of some exocyst complexes from the rim to the center of the septal region would lead to dramatic thickening of the septum. Further discussion would be beneficial to understand what the authors think this means.</p>

<p>The modest accumulation of vesicles and vesicle cargos at the division site is one of the reasons for the increased thickness of the division septum in septin mutants. It is more likely that the misplaced exocyst can still tether vesicles along the division plane without septins. Because of the lack of glucanase Eng1 at the rim of the division plane in septin mutants, daughter-cell separation is delayed and then cells continue to thicken the septum. We have added these points to the Discussion.</p>
