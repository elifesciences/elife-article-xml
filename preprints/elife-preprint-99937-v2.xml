<title>Abstract</title><p>Cells prevent heat damage through the highly conserved canonical heat stress response (HSR), where heat shock factors (HSFs) bind heat shock elements (HSEs) to activate heat shock proteins (HSPs). Plants generate short HSFs (S-HSFs) derived from <italic>HSF</italic> splicing variants, yet their functions remain poorly understood. While an enhanced canonical HSR confers thermotolerance, its hyperactivation inhibits plant growth. How plants prevent this hyperactivation to ensure proper growth remains unknown. Here, we report that <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> S-HsfA2, S-HsfA4c, and S-HsfB1 confer sensitivity to extreme heat (45 °C) and constitute new HSF types featuring a unique truncated DNA-binding domain (tDBD). This tDBD binds a new heat-regulated element (HRE), which confers minimal promoter heat-responsiveness and exhibits heat stress sensing and transmission patterns. Using S-HsfA2, we investigated whether and how S-HSFs prevent canonical HSR hyperactivation. <italic>HSP17.6B</italic>, a common direct target of HsfA2 and S-HsfA2, confers thermotolerance; however, its overexpression partially causes HSR hyperactivation. Moreover, HRE-HRE-like and HSE elements mediate the <italic>HSP17.6B</italic> promoter’s heat response. We further show S-HsfA2 alleviates hyperactivation via two mechanisms: 1) S-HsfA2 negatively regulates <italic>HSP17.6B</italic> via the HRE-HRE-like element, establishing a noncanonical HSR (S-HsfA2-HRE-<italic>HSP17.6B</italic>) that antagonistically represses HsfA2-activated <italic>HSP17.6B</italic> expression. 2) S-HsfA2 binds the HsfA2 DBD, preventing HsfA2 from binding HSEs and thereby attenuating HsfA2-activated <italic>HSP17.6B</italic> promoter activity. Overall, our findings highlight the essential role of S-HsfA2 in preventing hyperactivation of plant heat tolerance to maintain proper growth.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Elevated temperatures, <italic>i.e.,</italic> heat shock or heat stress, have become a global problem that threatens crop yields (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bita and Gerats, 2013</xref>). Cells prevent heat damage through the canonical heat stress response (HSR). In this canonical HSR, a heat shock factor (HSF) trimer binds a DNA <italic>cis</italic>-acting element called a heat shock element (HSE) to induce the production of heat shock proteins (HSPs). This canonical HSR is highly conserved among different organisms but is highly complex in plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Morimoto, 1993</xref>). Accordingly, heat-tolerant plants are usually generated by overexpressing <italic>HSFs</italic> or <italic>HSPs</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Fragkostefanakis et al., 2015</xref>). Several studies have revealed that an enhanced canonical HSR is beneficial for plant heat tolerance but also results in growth inhibition under normal conditions. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Zhu et al. (2009)</xref> reported that the overexpression of <italic>Boea hygrometrica Hsf1</italic> in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and tobacco confers plant thermotolerance but also leads to seedling dwarfism under normal conditions. When <italic>Arabidopsis HsfA2</italic> and <italic>HsfA3</italic> are overexpressed, these <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> plants tolerate increased heat stress but exhibit seedling dwarfism under nonstress conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Ogawa et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Yoshida et al., 2008</xref>). These findings reflect the active growth inhibition of canonical HSR hyperactivation under nonstress conditions, which is undesirable for plant productivity. However, much less is known about how plants prevent canonical HSR hyperactivation to ensure a balance between heat resistance and growth. Considering that HSRs are highly complex in plants, we reasoned that new types of HSFs that inhibit canonical HSR hyperactivation in plants exist. However, these new types of HSFs and their underlying regulatory mechanisms have yet to be determined in plants.</p>
<p>A common way for introns to expand the diversity of host gene products is alternative splicing (AS). An increasing number of studies have shown that heat stress-induced AS events in heat response genes, including HSFs, are very important regulatory mechanisms for the fitness of plants under heat stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Ling et al., 2021</xref>). Thus, we focused on heat-induced AS events in HSFs as a starting point for revealing new kinds of HSFs and their functions and regulatory mechanisms in the plant response to heat stress.</p>
<p>HSFs share similar constructs across eukaryotes, in which the HSE DNA-binding domain (DBD) is the most conserved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Nover et al., 2001</xref>). The DBD is a “winged” helix-turn-helix protein that consists of three α-helices (H1, H2, H3) and four-stranded antiparallel β-sheets (β1, β2, β3, β4). H3 directly binds to the HSE, and its adjacent wing domain (β3-loop-β4) is needed for the formation of HSF-HSE trimers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Littlefield and Nelson, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Ahn et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Feng et al., 2021</xref>). Interestingly, for all HSFs, the position of an intron within the DBD is conserved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Nover et al., 2001</xref>), and the intron is inserted between H3 and the wing domain coding region. In plants, mostly under heat stress, this intron is fully or partially retained to generate splice variants, such as <italic>Arabidopsis HsfA2-II</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Sugio et al., 2009</xref>), <italic>Arabidopsis HsfA2-III</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Liu et al., 2013</xref>), rice (<italic>Oryza sativa</italic>) <italic>OsHSFA2dII</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Cheng et al., 2015</xref>), lily (<italic>Lilium</italic> spp.) <italic>LlHSFA3B-III</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Wu et al. 2019</xref>), wheat (<italic>Triticum aestivum</italic>) <italic>TaHsfA2-7-AS</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Ma et al., 2023</xref>), and maize (<italic>Zea mays</italic>) <italic>ZmHsf17-II</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Zhang et al., 2024</xref>). These variants contain in-frame stop codons within the retained intron that may translate into short HSF isoforms (S-HSFs).</p>
<p>Several S-HSFs have been proven to play regulatory roles in thermotolerance in plants. Previously, we reported that heat stress-induced S-HsfA2 was detected by immunoblotting and can regulate the expression of <italic>HsfA2</italic> by binding to HSEs within the <italic>HsfA2</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Liu et al., 2013</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Wu et al. (2019)</xref> reported that LlHSFA3B-III (S-LIHSFA3B) can be detected by immunoblotting and that overexpressing <italic>S-HSFA3B</italic> reduces tolerance to acute heat (45°C) in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> plants. TaHsfA2-7 generates the splice variant TaHsfA2-7-AS (S-TaHsfA2-7), which confers tolerance to heat (45°C) in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Ma et al., 2023</xref>).</p>
<p>S-LIHSFA3B interacts with lily HSFA3A to limit its transactivation function and temper the function of lily HSFA3A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Wu et al., 2019</xref>). S-ZmHsf17 can interact with the DBD of full-length ZmHsf17 to suppress the transactivation of ZmHsf17 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Zhang et al., 2024</xref>). These findings suggest that S-HSFs can regulate the activities of HSFs through S-HSF-HSF protein interactions. However, how S-HSFs, as transcription factors, regulate plant heat responses remains unclear. Unlike classical HSFs, S-HSFs contain a unique C-terminal truncated DBD (tDBD) and an extended motif or domain encoded by the retained intron sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Liu et al., 2013</xref>). Although S-HSFs lack nuclear localization signals, S-HSFs can also localize to the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Sugio et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Liu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Cheng et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Wu et al. 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Ma et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Zhang et al., 2024</xref>). The tDBD lacks a wing domain and thereby might enable S-HSFs to recognize new heat-responsive DNA elements related to the HSE, whereas extended motifs or domains are variable in length and sequence and subsequently might contribute to regulatory roles, such as transcriptional regulation. Thus, S-HSFs could represent new kinds of plant HSFs. Considering that unique S-HSFs are expressed mostly under extreme heat stress, they could be associated with plant responses to heat stress. Therefore, uncovering the mechanism through which canonical HSR hyperactivation is regulated by S-HSFs will shed light on the balance between growth and thermotolerance.</p>
<p>In this study, we reported that S-HSFs (<italic>i.e.</italic>, S-HsfA2, S-HsfA4c, and S-HsfB1) are new kinds of HSFs that bind new heat-regulated elements (HREs) and negatively regulate <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> tolerance to extreme heat stress. Using S-HsfA2, we further investigated the molecular mechanisms by which S-HsfA2 prevents canonical HSR hyperactivation. The results showed that S-HsfA2 alleviates <italic>HSP17.6B</italic> overexpression-mediated HSR hyperactivation in two different ways: antagonistically repressing <italic>HSP17.6B</italic> overexpression through a noncanonical HSR and acting as a negative binding regulator of HSFs to inhibit the binding of HsfA2 to the HSE of the HSP17.6B promoter. Our results reveal new kinds of HSFs originating from HSF splicing variants and provide deep mechanistic insights into proper growth control against thermotolerance hyperactivity in plants.</p>

<title>S-HsfA2 confers sensitivity to extreme heat (45°C) sensitivity and inhibits growth in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic></title>
<p>S-HsfA2 contains a 42-aa N-terminal domain (N-ter), a 61-aa tDBD, and a 26-aa extended leucine (L)-rich domain (LRD) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). According to the predicted AlphaFold 3D structure of S-HsfA2, the LRD forms an α-helix structure (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). Given that S-HsfA2 is expressed under extreme heat (42°C) but not under moderate heat (37°C) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Liu et al., 2013</xref>), we determined its role in the tolerance of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> to extreme heat. Compared with the wild-type (WT) control, overexpression of Flag-tagged S-HsfA2 under the control of the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S RNA promoter (35S) (<italic>35S:S-HsfA2-Flag</italic>, S-HsfA2-OE) significantly reduced the seedling survival rate at 45°C for 2 h (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>).</p>

<p>Our previous study revealed that LRD is responsible for the transcriptional repression of S-HsfA2 in yeast cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Liu et al., 2013</xref>). We noted that a conserved transcriptional repression motif, LxLxLx (x=any amino acid) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Tiwari and Guilfoyle, 2004</xref>), exists in the LRD (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). Mutations (L to alanine (A)) in the LxLxLx motif (S-HsfA2<sup>L-A</sup>) converted S-HsfA2 from a transcriptional repressor to a transcriptional activator in yeast cells (Supplemental Figure S1), indicating that S-HsfA2 is an LxLxLx-type transcriptional repressor. Unlike S-HsfA2-OE, the overexpression of this dominant activator of S-HsfA2-Flag (S-HsfA2<sup>L-A</sup>-OE) failed to reduce the seedling survival rate compared with that of the WT control. However, S-HsfA2<sup>L-A</sup>-OE was more heat tolerant than S-HsfA2-OE was (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). When the plants were grown in soil, the S-HsfA2 genetic plants also presented a similar extreme heat response phenotype (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>).</p>
<p>Next, we generated S-HsfA2-encoding mRNA (<italic>HsfA2-III</italic>)<italic>-</italic>knockdown transgenic lines (S-HsfA2-KD) through RNA interference (RNAi) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). In three S-HsfA2-KD lines, RT-PCR splicing analysis revealed that <italic>HsfA2-III</italic> is not easily detected. Further RT-qPCR analysis revealed that the abundance of <italic>HsfA2-III</italic> and <italic>HsfA2-II</italic> but not the full-length <italic>HsfA2</italic> mRNA (except L1#) significantly decreased under extreme heat (42°C). Considering that <italic>HsfA2-III,</italic> but not <italic>HsfA2-II,</italic> is a predominant splice variant under extreme heat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Liu et al., 2013</xref>), RNAi led to the knockdown of alternative <italic>HsfA2</italic> splicing transcripts, especially <italic>HsfA2-III</italic> in S-HsfA2-KD. S-HsfA2-KD plants presented a clear resistance phenotype to extreme heat in both medium and soil (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>).</p>
<p>We also noted that the overexpression of S-HsfA2 caused short root length (growth in medium) and seedling dwarfism (growth in soil) under normal conditions (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>). However, these growth defects were partially improved in the S-HsfA2<sup>L-A</sup>-OE seedlings (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>).</p>
<p>Overall, these genetic data strongly confirm that S-HsfA2 confers extreme heat (45°C) sensitivity and inhibits growth in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> seedlings. More importantly, the LxLxLx motif is needed for S-HsfA2 biological functions.</p>

<title>Comparative transcriptome analysis identifies putative heat stress-responsive genes modulated by S-HsfA2</title>
<p>S-HsfA2<sup>L-A</sup>-OE plants exhibit greater thermotolerance than S-HsfA2-OE controls do, indicating that converting the transcriptional repressor S-HsfA2 into an activated form potentially modulates the expression levels of some heat stress-responsive genes (HRGs). To investigate this hypothesis, we conducted heat (42°C for 1 h)-induced comparative transcriptome profiling of seedlings of S-HsfA2-OE and S-HsfA2<sup>L-A</sup>-OE (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). The mRNA sequencing data met the quality control requirements (Q20&gt;97%, Q30&gt;92%), confirming that the sequencing quality was sufficient.

<title>S-HsfA2 binds a <italic>cis</italic>-acting element termed the heat-regulated element (HRE)</title>
<p>As S-HsfA2 is a transcription factor with a unique tDBD, we identified new <italic>cis</italic>-acting elements other than HSEs recognized by S-HsfA2 through chromatin immunoprecipitation combined with high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-Seq). To address this, we generated overexpression lines of GFP-tagged S-HsfA2 under 35S (<italic>35S:S-HsfA2-GFP</italic>). In two independent transgenic lines (#4 and #6), S-HsfA2-GFP signals were hardly detected under normal conditions. However, S-HsfA2-GFP was easily found in the nucleus after heat stress (42°C) treatment (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). These results suggested that S-HsfA2-GFP accumulates upon heat stress. This result is consistent with the finding that S-HsfA2 is localized in the nucleus of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> mesophyll protoplasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Liu et al., 2013</xref>).

<p>ChIP-Seq for these two lines with a GFP antibody identified 2163 and 3365 ChIP-Seq peaks (within the ±3 kb region of the transcription start site (TSS)), representing 2103 and 3216 unique genes in #4 and #6, respectively. ChIP-Seq dataset analysis revealed a centrosymmetric 7-bp motif (5′-GAAGAAG-3′). This motif was most significantly enriched (E=10<sup>−19</sup>) in the ChIP-Seq dataset (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). Because it was demonstrated to be a heat-regulated element, we hereafter name it an HRE. Since 322 genes were shared between these two lines, we identified 322 putative target genes of S-HsfA2. Given that transcription factors regulate target genes by binding to <italic>cis</italic>-elements within their promoters, the genomic distribution of the peaks revealed 25% enrichment in the promoter-TSS region corresponding to 80 candidate targets of S-HsfA2 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>, Supplemental Table S5). Among the 80 candidate targets, 65 contained HREs in their promoters (Supplemental Table S5).</p>
<p>HSEs are composed of at least three alternating nGAAn/nTTCn blocks (n denotes any nucleotide) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Amin et al., 1988</xref>). Accordingly, an HRE is considered a partially overlapping element of two inverted nGAAn blocks sharing a G base (5′-nGAA-&gt;G&lt;-AAGn-3′), indicating that the HRE and HSE are partially related. We next confirmed the binding of S-HsfA2 or tDBD to the HRE. The bacterially expressed and purified glutathione S-transferase (GST)-tagged S-HsfA2 fusion protein (GST-S-HsfA2) (Supplemental Figure S2) was used in electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs). The results revealed that GST-S-HsfA2 bound to the biotin-labelled HRE probes but not to the biotin-labelled mutated HRE probes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>). Furthermore, the GST-S-HsfA2 complex was weakened by the unlabelled HRE competitor, confirming that S-HsfA2 specifically binds HREs <italic>in vitro</italic>. According to the yeast one-hybrid (Y1H) assay, S-HsfA2 also specifically recognized HREs (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>). Interestingly, His6-tDBD recognized the HRE, but His6-DBD bound to the HSE <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>). Consistent with this observation, His-tagged HsfA2 did not bind to HREs <italic>in vitro</italic> (Supplemental Figure S3).

<title>HRE serves as a heat response element</title>

<title>S-HsfA2, S-HsfA4c, and S-HsfB1 represent new kinds of plant HSFs</title>
<p>Given that S-HsfA2 is an HRE-binding transcriptional repressor and confers extreme heat sensitivity in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, we hypothesized that S-HsfA2 represents a new HSF. The new HSFs are not limited to S-HsfA2 because tDBD is responsible for HRE binding and is highly conserved among S-HSFs. To provide further supporting data, we characterized S-HsfA4c, S-HsfB1, and S-HsfB2a, which were previously identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Liu et al., 2013</xref>).</p>
<p><italic>HsfA4c</italic> (At5G45710) has two splice variants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Liu et al., 2013</xref>): an intron 2-containing predominant S-<italic>HsfA4c</italic> and a less abundant intron 1-containing full-length <italic>HsfA4c. S-HsfA4c</italic> encodes S-HsfA4c. S-HsfA4c shares similar structural features (LxLxLx motif-containing LRD, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>) with S-HsfA2. <italic>S-HsfA4c</italic> was constitutively expressed, but heat stress increased its expression (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). S-HsfA4c acts as a transcriptional repressor in yeast cells, and LRD is needed for its transcriptional repression (Supplemental Figure S4). S-HsfA4c bound to the HRE via both Y1H (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>) and EMSA (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>).

<p>Like <italic>S-HsfA4c, S-HsfB1</italic> was constitutively expressed, but heat stress strongly increased its expression (Supplemental Figure S5A). In contrast, <italic>S-HsfB2a</italic> expression was heat stress inducible (Supplemental Figure S5A). S-HsfB1 and S-HsfB2a were localized to the nucleus of plant cells (Supplemental Figure S5B). S-HsfB2a is a weak transcriptional activator in yeast cells, but S-HsfB1 has no transactivation activity (Supplemental Figure S6). According to the Y1H results, both S-HsfB1 and S-HsfB2a could bind to the HRE (Supplemental Figure 5C). However, S-HsfB1, but not S-HsfB2a, bound to the HRE <italic>in vitro</italic> (Supplemental Figure 5D). Thus, S-HsfB2a did not appear to be an HRE-binding protein. Therefore, we selected S-HsfB1 for further confirmation of its effects on <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> thermotolerance. We found that seedling survival rate, especially chlorophyll content, was markedly reduced by S-HsfB1 overexpression (<italic>35S:S-HsfAB1-RFP</italic>) in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> plants under heat stress (Supplemental Figure 5E). In contrast, the specific knockdown of <italic>S-HsfB1</italic> through antisense RNA (targeting the retained intron sequences) and both the <italic>HsfB1</italic> and <italic>S-HsfB1</italic> double knockout resulted in increased seedling survival, especially in terms of the chlorophyll content, under heat stress (Supplemental Figure 5F).</p>
<p>Collectively, these data indicate that HRE binding, nuclear localization, and negative regulatory effects on extreme heat stress tolerance are common for S-HsfA2, S-HsfA4c, and S-HsfB1. Therefore, we conclude that these three S-HSFs represent new kinds of plant HSFs.</p>

We obtained a T-DNA-inserted <italic>HSP17.6B</italic> mutant (<italic>hsp17.6b-1</italic>), <italic>35S:HSP17.6B-Flag</italic> transgenic <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> plants in the WT background (HSP17.6B-OE), and <italic>35S:HSP17.6B-Flag</italic> transgenic <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> plants in the <italic>hsp17.6b-1</italic> background (HSP17.6B-KI) (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D</xref>). Subsequent heat tolerance phenotype analyses revealed that the <italic>hsp17.6b-1</italic> mutant was heat sensitive, whereas the HSP17.6B-OE lines were heat tolerant (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6E</xref>). The heat tolerance of the HSP17.6B-KI lines was similar to that of the WT control (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6E</xref>), suggesting that expressing <italic>35S:HSP17.6B</italic> rescued the heat-sensitive phenotype of the <italic>hsp17.6b-1</italic> mutant.</p>
<p>Overall, <italic>HSP17.6B</italic> confers thermotolerance, but S-HsfA2 represses <italic>HSP17.6B via</italic> the HRE-HRE-like element, which is involved in heat induction by Hsp17.6Bp. Thus, <italic>HSP17.6B</italic> links S-HsfA2 to extreme heat sensitivity in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>. On the basis of these findings, we propose that a noncanonical HSR, <italic>i.e.</italic>, S-HsfA2-HRE-<italic>HSP17.6B</italic>, is involved in extreme heat sensitivity.</p>

<title><italic>HSP17.6B</italic> overexpression mediates heat tolerance hyperactivation</title>
<p>We noted that <italic>HSP17.6B</italic> overexpression also retarded seedling growth under normal conditions, as indicated by both decreased biomass (fresh weight) and low chlorophyll content (chlorosis) (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6F</xref>). Compared with the WT control seedlings, the HSP17.6B-OE seedlings appeared to have a dwarf phenotype when grown in soil (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6F</xref>). Heat stress resulted in browning of the WT leaves, but the leaves of the HSP17.6B-OE plants remained green (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6F</xref>), suggesting that the HSP17.6B-OE seedlings also presented a heat-tolerant phenotype in the soil. These results demonstrated that <italic>HSP17.6B</italic> overexpression mediated, to some extent, heat tolerance hyperactivation. Therefore, the noncanonical S-HsfA2-HRE-<italic>HSP17.6B</italic> HSR may attenuate heat tolerance hyperactivation.</p>

<title>Canonical HSR: HsfA2-HSE-<italic>HSP17.6B</italic></title>
<p>HSP17.6Bp also contains an HSE that is involved in heat induction by HSP17.6Bp (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>). These findings suggest that <italic>HSP17.6B</italic> is regulated by HSFs. The constitutive expression of <italic>HSP17.6B</italic> is activated by <italic>HsfA2</italic> overexpression, but the heat-induced expression of <italic>HSP17.6B</italic> is markedly reduced in the <italic>HsfA2</italic> knockout mutant, suggesting that <italic>HSP17.6B</italic> is a putative target of HsfA2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Nishizawa et al., 2006</xref>). ChIP-qPCR of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> transiently expressing <italic>35S:HsfA2-RFP</italic> with an anti-RFP antibody revealed the direct binding of HsfA2-RFP to the HSE-containing <italic>HSP17.6Bp</italic> region (Supplemental Figure S7A, B). According to the Y1H assay results, HsfA2 also bound to the HSE within HSP17.6Bp (Supplemental Figure S7C). Together with the findings of a previous report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Nishizawa et al., 2006</xref>), our data confirmed that <italic>HSP17.6B</italic> is a direct target of HsfA2. Thus, a canonical HSR (HsfA2-HSE-<italic>HSP17.6B</italic>) is suggested.</p>
<p>Taken together, the above data indicate that S-HsfA2 and HsfA2 have opposite effects on <italic>HSP17.6B</italic> expression: repression by S-HsfA2 but activation by HsfA2. These findings suggest that the balance between HsfA2 and S-HsfA2 activity serves to fine-tune the <italic>HSP17.6B</italic> expression level, possibly preventing the hyperactivation of heat tolerance mediated by HSP17.6B overexpression.</p>

<title>S-HsfA2 interacts with several HSFs, including HsfA2</title>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The AS events of HSFs have been extensively described in plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Sugio et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Liu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Cheng et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Wu et al. 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Ma et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Zhang et al., 2024</xref>), but the specific biological functions of these splice variants and their underlying regulatory mechanisms have largely not been determined. In this study, we demonstrated that <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> S-HsfA2, S-HsfA4c, and S-HsfB1, which are derived from HSF splicing variants, represent new kinds of HSFs. Several molecular and genetic studies support this conclusion: (<italic>i</italic>) S-HsfA2 and S-HsfA4c are localized in the nucleus, especially after heat stress, reflecting their cellular heat response features; (<italic>ii</italic>) S-HsfA2, S-HsfA4c, and S-HsfB1 have a unique conserved tDBD that binds to the HRE, a new heat response element; and (<italic>iii</italic>) the overexpression of S-HsfA2, S-HsfA4c, or S-HsfB1 confers extreme heat stress sensitivity. We further revealed the molecular mechanisms underlying the ability of S-HsfA2 to prevent canonical HSR hyperactivation caused by <italic>HSP17.6B</italic> overexpression. Therefore, our findings reveal a novel mechanism by which plants balance thermotolerance and growth and offer insight into the breeding of thermotolerant plants.</p>

<title>Splice variants of HSFs generate new plant HSFs</title>
<p>In this work, we showed that <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> S-HsfA2, S-HsfA4c, and S-HsfB1 are generated from partial or full retention of the conserved intron in the DBD. S-HSFs (such as S-HsfA2, S-HsfA4c, and S-HsfB1) lack all the C-terminal functional domains of HSFs but share a common unique structural feature, <italic>i.e.,</italic> tDBD. Another structural feature of S-HSFs is extended motifs or domains encoded by the retained introns. However, their lengths and sequences vary among different S-HSFs and are therefore less conserved than those of the tDBD. For example, lengths of 26 aa, 30 aa, and 13 aa were found for S-HsfA2, S-HsfA4c, and S-HsfB1, respectively. Owing to these differences, S-HsfA2, S-HsfA4c, and S-HsfB1 can be functionally different.</p>
<p>We found that the extended domain, <italic>i.e.</italic>, the LRD, allows S-HsfA2 to act as a transcriptional repressor. More importantly, LRD is needed for the functions of S-HsfA2 in heat tolerance regulation. Through comparative transcriptome analysis, we found that several heat tolerance-related genes, including nine <italic>HSPs,</italic> three <italic>HSFs</italic>, and <italic>DREB2A,</italic> are putative heat stress-responsive genes modulated by S-HsfA2. The heat-induced expression levels of these genes were greater in S-HsfA2<sup>L-A</sup>-OE than in S-HsfA2-OE. While HSPs and HSFs are established thermotolerance factors, DREB2A reportedly confers thermotolerance in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> through directly activating <italic>HsfA3</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Schramm et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Yoshida et al., 2008</xref>). These findings may further explain why L-to-A mutations in the LxLxLx motif can rescue the negative role of S-HsfA2 in the tolerance of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> to heat stress. Therefore, we concluded that the extended motifs or domains are essential for the functions of S-HSFs.</p>
<p>Although S-HsfA2, S-HsfA4c, and S-HsfB1 have the conserved tDBD sequences plus adjacent extended motifs or domains, these small HSF isoforms are of biological importance since they negatively regulate extreme heat tolerance in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>. Notably, two aspects related to heat stress are consistent with their biological relevance. First, <italic>S-HsfA2</italic>, <italic>S-HsfA4c</italic>, and <italic>S-HsfB1</italic> strongly respond to extreme heat stress, indicating that they function in extreme heat stress in <italic>Arabidopsis.</italic> We also found that the constitutive expression of S-HsfA2 inhibits <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> growth. Therefore, <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> plants do not produce S-HsfA2 under normal conditions to avoid growth inhibition. Similar to the constitutive expression of S-HsfA2-GFP, the constitutive expression of S-HsfA4c-GFP or S-HsfB1-RFP resulted in extreme heat stress sensitivity in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> but inhibits root growth (Supplemental Figure S8). It is of interest to explore whether S-HsfA4c and S-HsfB1 participate in the same biological process, such as heat tolerance and growth, through the coregulation of downstream genes.</p>
<p>In addition, S-HsfA2-GFP and S-HsfA4c-GFP were more easily detected under heat stress than under nonstress. These findings suggest that S-HsfA2 or S-HsfA4c is possibly regulated post-transcriptionally and/or post-translationally. Detailed analysis of the underlying mechanism involved in S-HsfA2 or S-HsfA4c stability is therefore still warranted, thus allowing us to characterize how S-HSFs respond to heat stress at the protein level. Overall, our data strongly support that S-HSFs act as new kinds of HSFs and thus increase the diversity of HSFs.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, AS events in the DBD of plant HSFs have not been detected in animal HSFs. Several reports have shown that animal HSFs utilize exon skipping to generate HSF splicing isoforms containing full-length DBDs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Tanabe et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Fujikake et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Zhang et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Neueder et al., 2014</xref>). These animal HSF isoforms have different transcriptional activities and work synergistically to regulate the transcription of <italic>HSPs</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Tanabe et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Neueder et al., 2014</xref>). Therefore, new kinds of HSFs seem to be plant specific, reflecting a unique feature of plant systems.</p>

<title>HRE is a heat response element</title>
<p>HSE is a known heat-responsive element and is essential for heat-inducible transcription of genes. In this study, we showed that the HRE is a heat response element, as determined by molecular, biochemical, and genetic analyses. HRE confers a minimal promoter response to heat and is responsible for heat-induced expression of the <italic>HSP17.6B</italic> promoter. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">He et al. (2022)</xref> reported a heat stress sensing and transmission pathway at the whole-plant level. Nitric oxide (NO) bursts in the shoot apex under heat stress, and NO, an S-nitrosoglutathione, can rapidly move from shoot to root through the vascular system in whole <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> plants. Interestingly, the GUS reporter driven by HREs was constitutively expressed in the shoot apical region, and heat stress increased and promoted GUS movement along the shoot vascular system to the leaves and hypocotyl. Therefore, the HRE exhibits heat stress sensing and transmission patterns, indicating a heat regulation function.</p>
<p>The HRE consists of two inverted HSE blocks (nGAAn) that share a G base. Although HRE is partially related to HSE, it does not bind to the DBD or to HsfA2 <italic>in vitro</italic>. In contrast, HRE is recognized by tDBD, S-HsfA2, S-HsfA4c, and S-HsfB1 <italic>in vitro.</italic> Loss of the wing domain within the DBD might partly explain why the DNA-binding characteristics of the tDBD change.</p>
<p>We also noted that HREs can drive the constitutive expression of the <italic>GUS</italic> reporter and bind nuclear extracts under normal conditions. These data suggest that some unknown constitutive transcription factors other than S-HSFs exist in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>. In the future, these HRE-binding transcription factors need to be screened by Y1H and DNA-protein pulldown assays. These studies can further characterize the working molecular mechanisms of HREs.</p>

<title>S-HSFs act as new negative binding regulators of HSFs</title>
<p>During the canonical HSR, cells often utilize negative binding regulators of HSFs, including HSP70 and HSF-binding proteins (HSBPs), to inactivate HSFs in different ways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Morimoto, 1998</xref>). HSP70 represses the transcriptional activity of HSFs by directly binding to the transcriptional activation domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Baler et al., 1996</xref>). HSBPs are conserved small nuclear proteins that dissociate trimeric HSFs and abate transcription activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Satyal et al., 1998</xref>). <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> HSBP (At4G15802) attenuates the canonical HSR by interacting with HSFs and decreasing HSF DNA-binding activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Hsu et al., 2010</xref>).

In the present study, S-HsfA2 was also identified as a negative binding regulator of HsfA2. Unlike HSP70 and HSBPs, S-HsfA2 binds to the DBD, thus decreasing the HSE-binding capacity of HSFs such as HsfA2 and eventually attenuating HsfA2-regulated <italic>HSP17.6B</italic> promoter activity.</p>

With input as a positive control, anti-GST and anti-His6 antibodies were subsequently used to detect His6-HsfA2 and GST-S-HsfA2 in the pull-down samples by immunoblotting.</p>

<title>DNA-protein pulldown assay</title>
<p>DNA pulldown experiments were performed via Pulldown Kits for Biotin-Probes (Viagene Biotech, Changzhou, China) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, equal amounts (50 μg) of GST-S-HsfA2 or His6-HsfA2 or His6-HsfA2 were incubated in binding buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.5], 100 mM NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100 [v/v]) in a 4°C rotator for 0 h (control), 4 h, or 12 h. The corresponding samples were incubated with biotin-labelled HSE (7 ng) and 5 ng of polydeoxyinosinic-deoxycytidylic acid (dI-dC) for 40 min at 25°C. Then, the DNA/protein binding mixture was bound to streptavidin-agarose beads by incubation for 40 min at 25°C with gentle shaking and then washed three times to remove the unbound DNA/proteins. The bead-bound proteins were dissociated by boiling for 5 min in dissociation solution and analysed by immunoblotting (IB) with an anti-His6 antibody.</p>

<title>Dual-luciferase reporter assay</title>
<p>Leaves of <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> were infiltrated with a mixed bacterial mixture of <italic>Agrobacterium tumefaciens</italic> (with each construct at OD<sub>600</sub>=0.5) for induction via <italic>sHSP17.6Bp:LUC</italic> together with the paired effectors GUS-cYFP/HsfA2-nYFP, S-HsfA2-cYFP/HsfA2-nYFP, S-HsfA2-cYFP/GUS-nYFP, and GUS-cYFP/GUS-nYFP (vector control). LUC bioluminescence was detected after 48 h using D-luciferin, sodium salt (GOLDBIO) and a CCD camera (Tanon, China). LUC and REN activities were measured on an automated microplate reader (Varioskan Flash, Thermo, USA) via the Dual Luciferase Reporter Gene Assay Kit (Yeasen Biotechnology, Shanghai, China). The LUC/REN ratio of the GUS control (GUS-cYFP/GUS-nYFP) transformed with <italic>sHSP17.6Bp:LUC</italic> was used as the calibrator (set as 1). Three independent experiments were performed.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors report that Arabidopsis short HSFs S-HsfA2, S-HsfA4c, and S-HsfB1 confer extreme heat. They have truncated DNA binding domains that bind to a new heat-regulated element. Considering Short HSFA2, the authors have highlighted the molecular mechanism by which S-HSFs prevent HSR hyperactivation via negative regulation of HSP17.6B. The S-HsfA2 protein binds to the DNA binding domain of HsfA2, thus preventing its binding to HSEs, eventually attenuating HsfA2-activated HSP17.6B promoter activity. This report adds insights to our understanding of heat tolerance and plant growth.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) The manuscript represents ample experiments to support the claim.</p>
<p>(2) The manuscript covers a robust number of experiments and provides specific figures and graphs to in support of their claim.</p>
<p>(3) The authors have chosen a topic to focus on stress tolerance in changing environment.</p>
<p>(4) The authors have summarized the probable mechanism using a figure.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Quite minimum</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>In the present work, Chen et al. investigate the role of short heat shock factors (S-HSF), generated through alternative splicing, in the regulation of the heat shock response (HSR). The authors focus on S-HsfA2, an HSFA2 splice variant containing a truncated DNA-binding domain (tDBD) and a known transcriptional-repressor leucin-rich domain (LRD). The authors found a two-fold effect of S-HsfA2 on gene expression. On the one hand, the specific binding of S-HsfA2 to the heat-regulated element (HRE), a novel type of heat shock element (HSE), represses gene expression. This mechanism was also shown for other S-HSFs, including HsfA4c and HsfB1. On the other hand, S-HsfA2 is shown to interact with the canonical HsfA2, as well as with a handful of other HSFs, and this interaction prevents HsfA2 from activating gene expression. The authors also identified potential S-HsfA2 targets and selected one, HSP17.6B, to investigate the role of the truncated HSF in the HSR. They conclude that S-HsfA2-mediated transcriptional repression of HSP17.6B helps avoid hyperactivation of the HSR by counteracting the action of the canonical HsfA2.</p>
<p>The manuscript is well written and the reported findings are, overall, solid. The described results are likely to open new avenues in the plant stress research field, as several new molecular players are identified. Chen et al. use a combination of appropriate approaches to address the scientific questions posed. However, in some cases, the data are inadequately presented or insufficient to fully support the claims made. As such, the manuscript would highly benefit from tackling the following issues:</p>
<p>(1) While the authors report the survival phenotypes of several independent lines, thereby strengthening the conclusions drawn, they do not specify whether the presented percentages are averages of multiple replicates or if they correspond to a single repetition. The number of times the experiment was repeated should be reported. In addition, Figure 7c lacks the quantification of the hsp17.6b-1 mutant phenotype, which is the background of the knock-in lines. This is an essential control for this experiment</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>For the seedling survival rates and gene expression levels, we added statistical analysis based on at least two independent experiments. Figure 6E of the revised manuscript shows the phenotypes of the WT, hsp17.6b-1, HSP17.6B-KI, and HSP17.6B-OE plants and the statistical analysis of their seedling survival rates after heat exposure.</p>

<p>(2) In Figure 1c, the transcript levels of HsfA2 splice variants are not evident, as the authors only show the quantification of the truncated variant. Moreover, similar to the phenotypes discussed above, it is unclear whether the reported values are averages and, if so, what is the error associated with the measurements. This information could explain the differences observed in the rosette phenotypes of the S-HsfA2-KD lines. Similarly, the gene expression quantification presented in Figures 4 and 5, as well as the GUS protein quantification of Figure 3F, also lacks this crucial information.</p>

<p>(4) Mutants with low levels of S-HsfA2 yield smaller plants than the corresponding wild type. This appears contradictory, given that the proposed role of this truncated HSF is to counteract the growth repression induced by the canonical HSF. What would be a plausible explanation for this observation? Was this phenomenon observed with any of the other tested S-HSFs?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We found that the constitutive expression of S-HsfA2 inhibits Arabidopsis growth. Considering this, Arabidopsis plants do not produce S-HsfA2 under normal conditions to avoid growth inhibition. However, under heat stress, Arabidopsis plants generate S-HsfA2, which contributes to heat tolerance and growth balance. In the revised manuscript, we provided supporting data indicating that S-HsfA4c-GFP or S-HsfB1-RFP constitutive expression confers Arabidopsis extreme heat stress sensitivity but inhibits root growth (Supplemental Figure S8). Therefore, this phenomenon is also observed in S-HsfA4c-GFP or S-HsfB1-RFP.</p>

<p>In three S-HsfA2-KD lines, RT‒PCR splicing analysis revealed that HsfA2-II but not HsfA2-III is easily detected. In the revised manuscript, we added RT‒qPCR analysis, and the results revealed that the abundance of HsfA2-III and HsfA2-II but not that of the full-length HsfA2 mRNA significantly decreased under extreme heat (Figure 1C). Considering that HsfA2-III but not HsfA2-II is a predominant splice variant under extreme heat (Liu et al., 2013), S-HsfA2-KD may lead to the knockdown of alternative HsfA2 splicing transcripts, especially HsfA2-III.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors report that Arabidopsis short HSFs S-HsfA2, S-HsfA4c, and S-HsfB1 confer extreme heat. They have truncated DNA binding domains that bind to a new heat-regulated element. Considering Short HSFA2, the authors have highlighted the molecular mechanism by which S-HSFs prevent HSR hyperactivation via negative regulation of HSP17.6B. The S-HsfA2 protein binds to the DNA binding domain of HsfA2, thus preventing its binding to HSEs, eventually attenuating HsfA2-activated HSP17.6B promoter activity. This report adds insights to our understanding of heat tolerance and plant growth.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) The manuscript represents ample experiments to support the claim.</p>
<p>(2) The manuscript covers a robust number of experiments and provides specific figures and graphs in support of their claim.</p>
<p>(3) The authors have chosen a topic to focus on stress tolerance in a changing environment.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) One s-HsfA2 represents all the other s-Hsfs; S-HsfA4c, and S-HsfB1. s-Hsfs can be functionally different. Regulation may be positive or negative. Maybe the other s-hsfs may positively regulate for height and be suppressed by the activity of other s-hsfs.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In this study, we used S-HsfA2, S-HsfA4c, and S-HsfB1 data to support the view that “splice variants of HSFs generate new plant HSFs”. We also noted that S-HsfA2 cannot represent a traditional S-HSF. S-HsfA4c and S-HsfB1 may have functions other than S-HsfA2 because of their different C-terminal motifs or domains. Different S-HSFs might participate in the same biological process, such as heat tolerance, through the coregulation of downstream genes. We added this information to the discussion section.</p>

<p>The EMSA shown in Figures 2, 3, 4, and 5, which are critical to support the manuscript's claims, are of poor quality, without any repeats to support.

<p><bold>Reviewer  #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p>
<p>(1) The paper is overall well-written, but it could greatly benefit from reorganizing the results subsections. Currently, there are entire subsections dedicated to supplementary figures (e.g., lines 177-191) and main figures split into different subsections (e.g., lines 237-246). It is recommended to organize all the information related to a main figure into a single subsection and to incorporate the description of the corresponding supplementary figures. This would imply a general reorganization of the figures, moving some information to the supplementary data (for instance, the data in Figure 4 could be supplementary to Figure 5) and vice versa (Supplementary Figure 4 should be incorporated into main Figure 2, as it presents very important results). Also, Figures 7 and 8 would be better presented if merged into a single figure/subsection.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your suggestion. We have merged some figures into a single figure according to the main information. In the current version, there are 8 main figures, which includes a new figure.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) Survival phenotypes vary widely, making reliable statistical analysis challenging. The chlorophyll and fresh weight quantifications presented in figures such as Figure 5 appear to effectively describe the phenomenon and allow for statistical comparisons. Figures 1 and 7 would benefit from including these measurements if the variability in survival percentages is too high to calculate statistical differences reliably. Also, in Figure 8, all chlorophyll measurements should be normalized to fresh weight rather than seedling number due to the dwarfism observed in the overexpressor lines.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for pointing out your concerns. We added statistical analysis based on at least two independent experiments, including Figures 1 and 7, to the original manuscript. In Figure 8 in the original manuscript, chlorophyll measurements were normalized to fresh weight.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with your suggestion. In this study, HSP17.6B was identified as a direct gene of S-HsfA2 and HsfA2, which can partly explain the role of S-HsfA2 in heat resistance and growth balance. However, the mechanical mechanism by which S-HsfA2 regulates heat tolerance and growth balance may not be limited to HSP17.6B. On the basis of the current data, we propose that the putative S-HsfA2-DERB2A-HsfA3 module might be associated with the roles of S-HsfA2 in heat tolerance and growth balance. Please refer to the discussion section for a detailed explanation.</p>

<p>(11) Line 251 on page 11 of the submitted manuscript says that the s-Hsfs were previously identified by Liu et al. (2013) yet in the abstract the authors claim that these s-HsFs are NEW kinds of HSF with a unique truncated DNA-binding domain (tDBD) that binds a NEW heat-regulated element (HRE).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In our previous report, several S-HSFs, including S-HsfA2, S-HsfA4, S-HsfB1, and S-HsfB2a, were identified primarily in Arabidopsis (Liu et al., 2013). In this study, we further characterized S-HsfA2, S-HsfA4, and S-HsfB1 and revealed several features of S-HSFs. Therefore, we claim that these S-HSFs are new kinds of HSFs.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(12) What are these NEW kinds of HRE? Which genes have these HRE? Was an in silico study conducted to study it or can any reports can be cited?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>HREs, i.e., heat-regulated elements, are newly identified heat-responsive elements in this study. The sequences of HREs are partially related to traditional heat shock elements (HSEs). Because we did not identify the essential nucleic acids required for t-DBD binding to the HRE, we did not perform an in silico study.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(13) S-HSFs may interact with existing HSFs. Have the authors thought in this direction? It can have a role in positively regulating other sHSFs or regulating multiple expressing genes related to plant growth and other functions. This needs to be explored.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for this point. Given that the overexpression of Arabidopsis HsfA2 or HsfA3 inhibits growth under nonstress conditions, we discussed this direction from the perspective of the interaction of S-HsfA2 with HsfA2 or HsfA3 in the revised manuscript.</p>
