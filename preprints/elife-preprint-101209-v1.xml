<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Many fungal pathogens develop specialized infection structures such as appressoria to penetrate plant cells. However, it is not clear whether special structures are formed after cell wall penetration before invading host cytoplasm membrane in hemibiotrophic pathogens. Here, we showed that a penetration ring consisting of Ppe1 secreted proteins is formed after appressorium-mediated cell wall penetration and remained at the base of penetration site after invading plant cytoplasm membrane in the rice blast fungus <italic>Magnaporthe oryzae</italic>. The same persistent Ppe1 ring is formed after the penetration of neighboring cells by transpressoria. <italic>PPE1</italic> is specifically expressed during plant infection and the Δ<italic>ppe1</italic> mutant is defective in penetration and invasive growth. Blockage of penetration peg formation impedes the development of the Ppe1 ring. Close examinations showed that the penetration ring is formed at the collar of penetration pegs between plant cell wall and cytoplasm membrane and it is persistent as a fixed ring even after invasive hyphae invaded neighboring cells. Furthermore, Ppe1 is a member of an expanded family of secreted proteins that are unique to fungal pathogens using extreme appressorium turgor for plant penetration. Other members of the Ppe1 family also localize to the penetration ring for anchoring on cytoplasm membrane during plant infection. Taken together, a penetration ring consisting of a family of secreted proteins is formed between plant cell wall and cytoplasm membrane, which may function as a novel physical structure at the interface between the tip of penetration pegs and plant cytoplasm membrane before the differentiation of invasive hyphae.</p>

<title>Significance Statement</title>
<p>Like many other plant pathogens, the rice blast fungus forms melanized appressoria (specialized infection structures) to penetrate plant cells. In this study, we showed that a penetration ring is formed by penetration pegs after appressorium- or transpressorium-mediated penetration of plant cell wall.

<title>Introduction</title>
<p><italic>Magnaporthe oryzae</italic>, a filamentous ascomycete, is the causal agent of the devastating rice blast disease, which poses a significant threat to global rice production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>). In addition to rice, <italic>M. oryzae</italic> is capable of infecting a wide range of grass species, including major cereal crops such as wheat, barley, oat, and millet, thus compromising global food security (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>). As one of the most important plant diseases, it is mainly controlled by planting resistant cultivars. Nevertheless, outbreaks of rice blast still occur throughout rice growing regions worldwide because of breakdown of resistance by new races of the pathogen. In addition, wheat blast caused by <italic>M. oryzae</italic> pathovar <italic>Triticum</italic> has recently spread from South America to Asia, threatening wheat production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>).</p>
<p>Like many other foliar fungal pathogens, penetration of the cuticle and cell wall of host plants is the most critical infection step (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>). The infection cycle of <italic>M. oryzae</italic> starts with attachment of dispersing conidia to plant surface by releasing sport tip mucilage. Germ tubes emerging from attached conidia can sense surface hydrophobicity and hardness and develop highly specialized infection structures known as appressoria at the tip (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>). Mature dome-shaped appressoria are anchored on rice surface with appressorium mucilage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>) and heavily melanized by depositing a melanin layer between the cell wall and membrane as an impermeable barrier for turgor generation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>). Subsequently, the appressorium uses the extremely high turgor pressure to physically penetrate the cuticle and cell wall with a narrow penetration peg (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>). As an hemibiotrophic pathogen, after the penetration of plant cell wall, the penetration peg does not penetrate plant cytoplasm membrane but differentiates into primary invasive hyphae and invasive hyphae that are enveloped by plant-derived extra-invasive hyphal membrane (EIHM) in penetrated cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>). To date, it is not clear whether there is any special structure at the contact point between the penetration peg and plant cytoplasm membrane before the differentiation of primary invasive hyphae. However, a biotrophic interfacial complex (BIC), a plant membrane-rich structure, is formed at the tip of the primary invasive hyphae for effector delivery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>). Following proliferation within the first colonized cell, the tips of invasive hyphae differentiate into transpressoria, which subsequently form narrow infection pegs to traverse the plasmodesmata (PD)-rich cell junctions, allowing entry into adjacent host cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>). The fungus continues this colonization strategy until disease symptoms manifest on infected rice plants.</p>
<p>To suppress plant defense responses and facilitate invasive growth, <italic>M. oryzae</italic> deploys effectors with various functions that can be delivered into host tissues or cells with two secretion systems during infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>). Apoplastic effectors, such as Bas4 and Slp1, accumulate in the extracellular space between the fungal invasive hyphal cell wall and EIHM, outlining the entire invasive hyphae, are secreted through the conventional endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-Golgi-dependent pathway which is sensitive to brefeldin A (BFA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>). Conversely, cytoplasmic effectors, including Pwl2, AvrPiz-t, and Bas1, accumulate in the BIC before being delivered into plant cells using a Golgi-independent pathway involving the exocyst complex and t-SNAREs, which is insensitive to BFA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>). To date, all the known proteinaceous effectors in <italic>M. oryzae</italic> belong to these two categories and localize to the extracellular space outlining invasive hyphae or the BICs and intracellular targets inside plant cells.</p>
<p>In a previous study, we identified a family of small secreted proteins that may function as effectors in <italic>M. oryzae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>). In this study, we found that one of them named as <italic>PPE1</italic> (for <underline>p</underline>eg <underline>p</underline>eriphery-localized <underline>e</underline>ffector <underline>1</underline>, MGG_16603) is specifically expressed during plant infection and is a crucial virulence factor. Surprisingly, Ppe1 preferentially localizes to the penetration site in a ring conformation that is described as the penetration ring below. The penetration ring consisting of Ppe1 proteins is formed after appressorium- and transpressorium-mediated plant cell wall penetration and remained at the point where penetration pegs transitioning into primary invasive hyphae. Ppe1 homologs are only present in fungal pathogens using extreme appressorium turgor for plant penetration. Other members of the Ppe1 family also localize to the penetration ring that is at the base of primary invasive hyphae outside plant cytoplasm membrane. Taken together, a penetration ring consisting of secreted Ppe1 family proteins is formed between plant cell wall and cytoplasm membrane, which may function as a novel physical structure at the interface between the tip of penetration pegs and plant cytoplasm membrane before the differentiation of invasive hyphae.</p>

<title>Ppe1 is important for full virulence of <italic>M. oryzae</italic></title>
<p>We previously identified 21 host-adapted effector genes in <italic>M. oryzae</italic> that may play critical roles during rice infection based on <italic>in silico</italic> analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>). To explore the functions of these effectors, we selected <italic>PPE1</italic> (MGG_16603) for further functional characterization because its high transcription level during early infection stages as reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>). We first assayed the expression profile of <italic>PPE1</italic> during infection by qRT-PCR. The result showed that its expression increased during the early stages of plant infection (24-36 hpi) and peaked at 36 hpi (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). Moreover, fluorescence signals of mCherry driven by the <italic>PPE1</italic> promoter indicated that its expression was only observed in matured appressoria and during infection (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>). These results were consistent with the transcriptome data, suggesting that Ppe1 is functional during appressorium penetration and plant infection. Ppe1 encodes a 116-aa protein with typical characteristics of fungal effectors, including an N-terminal signal peptide and eight cysteine residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Fig. S1A</xref>). The signal peptide of Ppe1 is functional in directing the secretion of yeast Suc2 invertase in a yeast signal trap system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Fig. S1B</xref>), suggesting that Ppe1 is a secreted protein.</p>

<p>To determine the biological functions of Ppe1 in <italic>M. oryzae,</italic> we generated a <italic>PPE1</italic> gene deletion mutant in the wild-type strain 70-15 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Fig. S1C</xref>). Deletion of <italic>PPE1</italic> had no obvious effect on the fungal growth, conidiation, and appressorium formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Fig. S1D-G</xref>). However, in spray infection assays with rice leaves, the Δ<italic>ppe1</italic> mutant was significantly reduced in the number of disease lesions compared to the wild type (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>). In wound infection assays, the Δ<italic>ppe1</italic> mutant also was significantly reduced in virulence and formed smaller lesions than the wild type (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>). To confirm the role of <italic>PPE1</italic> in virulence, we generated a complemented strain Δ<italic>ppe1-</italic>com that had a copy of the <italic>PPE1</italic> gene ectopically integrated into its genome. In spray or wound infection assays, Δ<italic>ppe1-</italic>com was similar with the wild type in virulence (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C-D</xref>), indicating a complete recovery in phenotypes. We then conducted rice leaf sheath penetration assays to observe the infection processes. At 32 hpi, over 91% of the appressoria formed by the wild type and the complemented strain had penetrated and developed invasive hyphae in rice cells. Invasive hyphae in most of the penetrated cells (approximately 60%) had more than two branches, and approximately 10% of them had spread into the neighboring cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>). In contrast, approximately 25% of the appressoria formed by the Δ<italic>ppe1</italic> mutant had no penetration peg. Although 53.5% of these mutant appressoria successfully penetrated into host cells, only 23% of Δ<italic>ppe1</italic> invasive hyphae had more than two branches and less than 4% had spread into adjacent cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>). These results indicate that the Δ<italic>ppe1</italic> mutant has defects in appressorium penetration, invasive hyphal growth and subsequent spread of invasive hyphae into neighboring plant cells.</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<title>Ppe1 forms a ring at the base of appressoria during host penetration</title>
<p>To determine the localization of Ppe1 during infection, we expressed a full-length Ppe1-mCherry fusion protein under the control of <italic>PPE1</italic> promoter in both the wild type (70–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>) and the Δ<italic>ppe1</italic> mutant. Rice leaf sheaths were then infected with these strains and the localization of Ppe1 was analyzed by confocal microscopy. In these transformants, Ppe1-mCherry signals were observed as a ring underneath the appressoria (likely at the site of the emergence of penetration pegs) at 22 hpi (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>, Video S1). The Ppe1-mCherry ring persisted after appressorial penetration and the ring-shaped fluorescence signal of the Ppe1-mCherry was still observed even after the formation of primary and secondary invasive hyphae (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>). We further measured the size of this ring and found that the average diameter of the inner cycle of the Ppe1-mCherry ring was 1.53 μm. The width of the Ppe1-mCherry ring varied from 1.79 to 4.78 μm, which is smaller than the width of appressoria (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>) and known septin ring (5.9 μm) at the appressorium pore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>). Furthermore, the Ppe1-mCherry fusion protein could be detected by western blot analysis with proteins isolated from infected rice leave (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Fig. S2</xref>). Because the Ppe1 ring always appears at the point of emergence of the penetration peg, we named this ring structure as penetration ring.</p>

</fig>
<p>To confirm the localization of Ppe1, we also generated Ppe1-GFP transformants. Like Ppe1-mCherry, Ppe1-GFP also formed a ring at the penetration site underneath the appressorium (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>). These results indicate that, irrespective of being fused with mCherry or GFP, Ppe1 localizes to the penetration ring. To avoid possible overexpression or unexpected effects due to ectopic integration of the fusion constructs, we generated a transformant from 70-15 strain in which mCherry was inserted right before the TAA stop codon of the endogenous <italic>PPE1</italic> gene. In the resulting transformant expressing the in situ <italic>PPE1</italic>-mCherry fusion construct, the penetration ring was also observed (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref>).

<title>Penetration ring is also formed during the penetration of neighboring cells by transpressoria</title>

<title>Penetration ring is formed on the periphery of the penetration peg</title>
<p>In <italic>M. oryzae</italic>, appressorium-mediated penetration is a septin-dependent process in which septins aggregate and generate a hetero-oligomeric 5.9 μm ring structure at the appressorial pore to re-organize the F-actin cytoskeleton network to promote the emergence of penetration pegs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>). Following the penetration peg formation, septin ring undergoes further constriction into a smaller ring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>). To clarify the precise site of the penetration ring, we expressed Ppe1-mCherry (under the control of the <italic>PPE1</italic> promoter) in a strain expressing Sep3-GFP (Guy11 background) and then observed their spatiotemporal dynamics during rice leaf sheath infection. At 11 hpi, Sep3-GFP big ring was formed at the appressorium pore but the Ppe1-mCherry ring was not observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">Fig. S3A</xref>, Video S2). The Ppe1-mCherry ring signal was observed at 16 hpi, after the constriction of Sep3-GFP ring and the former was completely surrounding the latter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">Fig. S3B</xref>). Subsequently (at 19 hpi), the Ppe1-mCherry ring (still surrounding the Sep3-GFP ring) became constricted (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">Fig. S3C</xref>, Video S3). However, on impenetrable hydrophobic coverslips, the Sep3-GFP ring was formed normally at the appressorium pore, but the Ppe1-mCherry ring and constriction of Sep3-GFP were not observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4">Fig. S4</xref>). These results suggest that Ppe1-mCherry ring is formed after the formation of penetration pegs, outside the constricted Sep3-GFP ring.</p>

<p>Penetration pegs are rich in microfilaments, filasomes and microtubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>), therefore, it can be labeled by Lifeact-GFP. Hence, we co-expressed Ppe1-mCherry with Lifeact-GFP in 70-15 and observed their positioning in penetration assays with rice leaf sheaths. The Ppe1-mCherry ring was also observed to surround the Lifeact-GFP signal (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>, Video S4), indicating that the penetration ring is localized at the periphery of penetration pegs during the initial infection stage. To confirm this observation, we co-expressed the Ppe1-mCherry with cytosolic GFP in 70-15. Using a three-dimensional (3D) volume rendering image constructed by confocal optical z-series images, we found that the Ppe1-mCherry ring was situated around the narrow site between the appressorium and invasive hyphae labeled with GFP (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>).</p>
<p>A previous study showed that callose deposition is dynamic during <italic>M. oryzae</italic> infection and has three different forms: callose-rich papillae underneath appressorium penetration sites, callose collars formed at cell wall crossing sites around the invasive hyphae and callose deposition at plasmodesmata pit fields (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>). To investigate whether the penetration ring locates outside the peg, we stained callose deposits with aniline blue to examine the possible positioning of the callose ring underneath the appressorial penetration site and Ppe1-mCherry. We discovered that the Ppe1-mCherry ring was surrounded by the callose ring, exhibiting partial colocalization and close attachment (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref>, Video S5). Taken together, we conclude that the penetration ring locates at the periphery of penetration peg during the initial appressorium-mediated host penetration.</p>

<title>Penetration ring formation requires the initiation of penetration peg formation</title>

In the Δ<italic>mst12</italic> mutant that is defective in both penetration initiation and peg formation, the Ppe1-mCherry fluorescence signal could not be detected.

To confirm this observation, the localization of Ppe1-mCherry fusion proteins was observed after inducing appressorium formation on hydrophobic coverslips and cellophane membranes. Although melanized appressoria were formed, we failed to observed the Ppe1-mCherry ring on the impenetrable coverslips (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>).

<title>Other Ppe proteins also localize to the penetration ring</title>
<p>To determine whether other secreted proteins homologous to Ppe1 also localize to the penetration ring, we used the amino acid sequence of Ppe1 to carry out BLASTp search at the NCBI database to uncover the homolog proteins of Ppe1 and further analyzed their phylogenetic relationships. The Ppe1 homologs only exist in <italic>Magnaporthe</italic> and <italic>Colletotrichum</italic> species, such as the most common cereal phytopathogens <italic>M. oryzae</italic> and <italic>C. graminicola</italic> (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>). Remarkably, these fungi are known to form melanized appressoria and deploy extremely high turgor pressure for plant penetration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>). To understand whether other members of the Ppe1 family (Ppe2, Ppe3, Ppe3, Ppe4, Ppe5, and Ppe6) from <italic>M. oryzae</italic> have similar localization as Ppe1, we tagged each of them with mCherry and expressed them individually in the 70-15 background under the control of their native promoters. Examination of their localizations during infection revealed that Ppe2-mCherry, Ppe3-mCherry and Ppe5-mCherry also exhibit a ring structure during appressorium-mediated host penetration, while the fluorescence signals of Ppe4-mCherry and Ppe6-mCherry were hardly observed, possibly due to their low expression (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref>). Moreover, when MoT-Ppe1 from <italic>M. oryzae</italic> pathovar <italic>Triticum</italic> was expressed in <italic>M. oryzae</italic> under the control of its native promoter, the characteristic penetration ring was also observed (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref>).

<p>As controls, we also examined the localizations of Bas4, Slp1, Pwl2, and AvrPiz-t. Under the same experimental conditions, Bas4-GFP and Slp1-GFP were observed to uniformly accumulate within the extra-invasive hyphal membrane (EIHM), outlining the entire invasive hyphae, while Pwl2-mCherry and AvrPiz-t-GFP accumulated in the biotrophic interfacial complex (BIC) (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C</xref>), which is consistent with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>). EIHM and BIC are specifically associated with invasive hyphae during biotrophic growth. In contrast, Ppe1 localized to the penetration ring at the periphery of penetration pegs (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C</xref>). Therefore, unlike subcellular localizations of other effectors to the extracellular space outlining invasive hyphae, BICs, or intracellular targets in plant cells, Ppe1 and its homologs localize to the penetration ring that may function as a novel physical structure at the interface between the tip of penetration pegs and plant cytoplasm membrane before the differentiation of invasive hyphae.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>As the model plant pathogenic fungus, appressorium formation and appressorium-mediated penetration have been well-characterized in <italic>M. oryzae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>). The fungus uses extremely high turgor pressure generated in appressoria cemented to the surface with appressorium mucilage to penetrate underlying plant cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>). As an hemibiotrophic pathogen, after piercing plant cell wall, the penetration peg does not penetrate the cytoplasm membrane but differentiates into invasive hyphae enveloped in a layer of EIHM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>). In this study, we showed that a penetration ring of Ppe1 proteins is formed by the penetration peg on the surface of the plant cytoplasm membrane before invading and differentiating into primary invasive hyphae (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> and <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>). Other Ppe proteins including Ppe2, Ppe3, and Ppe5 proteins also localize to the penetration ring (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref>). Because the penetration ring is persistent at the point penetration pegs transitioning into invasive hyphae outside the cytoplasm membrane even after the penetrated cells are filled with invasive hyphae, it may function as a novel physical structure for anchoring penetration pegs on the surface of plant cytoplasm membrane after cell wall penetration (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>). It is also possible that this penetration ring functions as a collar or landmark that is associated with the differentiation of penetration pegs (on the surface of cytoplasm membrane) into primary invasive hyphae enveloped in the EIHM cytoplasm membrane (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>). Although this transition is not well characterized, it likely involves changes in cell polarity and cytoskeleton as well as cell wall modifications. Ppe1 and its homologs may be able to assemble into a protein complex in the penetration ring, which likely involves other proteins or components as facilitating factors. In <italic>U. maydis</italic>, the Stp secreted effectors are known to form a protein complex during plant infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>The penetration ring is also formed after transpressoria-mediated penetration of neighboring plant cells (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>). Similarly, Ppe1 and its homologs form a ring after the penetration of cell wall but before differentiating into invasive hyphae enveloped with the EIHM. The penetration ring formed by transpressoria-mediated penetration is also persistent at the penetration site on the surface of plant cytoplasm membrane in penetrated cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs5">Fig. S5</xref>), suggesting that Ppe proteins are assembled into a complex that is not diffusible. In fact, similar penetration ring is observed after penetration of artificial membrane (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>), which has no barrier to restrict the diffusion of secreted proteins, further indicating that the penetration ring of Ppe1 and other Ppe proteins is likely a structural feature or component for signaling the transition of penetration pegs to invasive hyphae. Although appressoria and transpressoria are different, the processes after the penetration of cell wall are the same in appressorium- and transpressorium-mediated plant penetration. Therefore, formation of the penetration ring in both appressorium- and transpressorium-mediated penetration is another evidence for it to be a structural element.</p>
<p><italic>M. oryzae</italic> is known to secrete a repertoire of effectors that can be categorized into cytoplasmic and intracellular effectors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>). Ppe1 and its homologs are putative effectors that are described as HAG (host adaptation genes) effectors in an earlier study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>). Although it remains possible that Ppe1 and its homologs function as effectors during plant infection. However, in comparison with the localizations of known effectors in <italic>M. oryzae</italic>, we found that the localization of Ppe1 to the penetration ring is unique and Ppe1 homologs have the same localization pattern (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>). Because of the persistent localization of Ppe1 and its homologs to the penetration ring, we think the penetration ring is likely a physical structure as described above. If Ppe1 and its homologs are effector proteins being secreted at this specific location, fluorescent signals of Ppe1 and its homologs will diffuse and disappear or dimmish when effectors being translocated into plant cells. Furthermore, it is unlikely that secreted proteins localized to the penetration ring that has limited contact with the plant cytoplasm membrane will function as effector proteins to interact with plant targets. Nevertheless, although unlikely, it remains possible that the penetration ring discovered in this study is a secretion site for effectors involved in the transition of penetration pegs to invasive hyphae. After the penetration of plant cell wall, the penetration ring may not only function as a physical structure but also serve as an initial effector secretion site for the release of specific effectors to overcome plant immunity in early infection stages.</p>
<p>Taken together, in this study we observed the formation of the penetration ring that appears to be a structural element for signaling or triggering the differentiation of penetration pegs after the penetration of plant cell wall into invasive hyphae enveloped by the EIHM in <italic>M. oryzae</italic>. Based on the limited distribution of Ppe1 homologs, it is likely that only fungal pathogens using high appressorium turgor for plant penetration, such as <italic>M. oryzae</italic> and <italic>Colletotrichum</italic> species, developed the penetration ring. Therefore, it will be important to further characterize the functional relationship between the penetration ring and appressorium turgor as well as the transition of penetration pegs driven by turgor pressure into primary invasive hyphae (lower turgor pressure).</p>

C113-01, Vazyme, Nanjing, China). The constructed plasmid was introduced into <italic>Agrobacterium tumefaciens</italic> AGL1 using freeze-thaw method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>). <italic>Agrobacterium tumefaciens</italic>-mediated transformation (ATMT) of the construct into the wild-type spores was then carried out. The transformants were selected on hygromycin B plates and confirmed by PCR. The mutants were further confirmed by Southern blot assay using DIG-High Prime DNA labeling and detection starter kit I (Cat. no. 11745832910, Roche, Mannheim, Germany). For complementation, the constructed plasmid pKNT-Ppe1-mCherry was transformed into the Δ<italic>ppe1</italic> mutant protoplast and further verified by PCR screening and confocal microscopic examination for fluorescence signal detection.</p>

<title>Live cell imaging</title>
<p>To monitor the expression and subcellular localization of Ppe1 during plant infection, rice leaf sheath inoculation and live cell imaging of fluorescently labeled proteins were performed as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>) with slight modifications. In brief, 5-7 cm long leaf sheath segments were cut from 4-week-old CO-39 rice seedlings, and the whole hollow spaces of the sheaths were filled with conidia suspensions (5×10<sup>4</sup> conidia/mL) using a 200 μL pipette. The inoculated sheaths were placed horizontally (fixed with wet filter paper fragments) on an inverted 96-well PCR plate covered by one layer of wet filter paper and incubated in a sealed box whose inner bottom was lined with two layers of wet filter paper to keep the environment humid at 26 ℃. The epidermal parts of the inoculated sheaths were trimmed into thin and transparent samples and immediately imaged using an inverted Nikon A1 laser scanning confocal microscope (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan) at the indicated time points post inoculation. The 60×/1.42 numerical aperture (NA) oil immersion objective lens was used for the imaging. The fluorescence and differential interference contrast (DIC) images were collected by confocal optical z-series acquired at 0.28 µm intervals spanning the entire fluorescence signal depth between the top plane of the appressorium formed and the bottom plane of the rice leaf sheath cross sections. The fluorescence excitation/emission wavelengths were 488 nm/500-550 nm for GFP, 561 nm/570-620 nm for mCherry and 405 nm/425-475 nm for callose staining. The images were processed using NIS-Elements AR analysis software (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan). Unless otherwise stated in the figure legend, micrograph fluorescence represents maximum intensity projection of z-series (with a 0.28 µm intervals) after removing extraneous z-planes that do not contain relevant information for a particular fluorescence. Three-dimensional (3D) volume rendering images and videos were generated from z-series in maximum intensity projection.</p>
<p>To observe the subcellular localizations of Ppe1 in conidia incubated on artificial hydrophobic surfaces and barley leaves, conidia suspensions (5×10<sup>4</sup> conidia/mL) were dropped on the surfaces of hydrophobic coverslips or on the back sides of barley leaves (5-day old plants) and incubated under humid and dark conditions at a 26 ℃. For observation, the hydrophobic coverslips containing the appressoria were inverted, placed on 24mm×50 mm microscope glass slides and then observed under a scanning confocal microscope. Epidermal parts were removed from the infected barley leaves for observation. For penetration assay, cellophane was cut into round sheets of 4 cm in diameter and sterilized by autoclaving at 115 ℃ for 15 min. The sterile cellophane sheets were placed flat on CM plates and then the conidia suspensions (5×10<sup>4</sup> conidia/mL) were dropped on the surface of the cellophane and incubated at 26 ℃. Small pieces of the cellophane containing mycelia were cut for observation under a confocal microscope at 36-48 hpi.</p>

<title>Callose staining</title>
<p>For visualization of deposited callose, aniline blue (Cat. no. 28631-66-5, Sangon, Shanghai, China) staining was adopted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>). Rice leaf sheaths were inoculated with conidia suspensions (3×10<sup>4</sup> conidia/mL). The inoculated sheaths were trimmed to thin and transparent samples at the indicated time points and stained with aniline blue (0.1mg/mL) solution prepared in 150 mM KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> (pH 9.5) for up to 30 min. The stained samples were imaged by using a laser scanning confocal microscope (Nikon, Japan).</p>

<title>Phenotypic analysis</title>
<p>For vegetative growth and conidiation assays, small mycelial blocks from each strain were cut from the edges of 4-day-old cultures and placed at the center of freshly prepared CM plates (90 mm) and incubated for ten days at 26 ℃. The colony diameters of the cultures were measured using vernier calipers and then photographs of the cultures were taken. The cultures were then washed with 5 mL sterilized double-distilled water, filtered through three layers of lens paper and the conidia counted using a hemocytometer under a light microscope. For conidia germination and appressoria formation, spore suspensions (1×10<sup>5</sup> conidia/mL) were incubated on hydrophobic coverslips (Cat. no. 12-545-101P, Fisherbrand™ Cover Glasses, USA) under humid and dark conditions at 26 ℃ for 24 h. The conidia were then observed under a light microscope for germination and formation of appressoria.</p>
<p>To investigate the pathogenicity of each strain, conidia spray, punch and leaf sheath inoculations were performed. Conidia suspensions (5×10<sup>4</sup> conidia/mL containing 0.02% Tween-20) were used to spray the leaf surfaces of 3-week-old CO-39 rice seedlings. The inoculated seedlings were incubated in a growth chamber at 25 ℃ with 90% humidity. The seedlings were first kept in the dark for 24 h, and then subjected to 12 h light / 12 h dark photoperiod for 7 days, after which photographs were taken and the number of disease lesions on the leaf surfaces counted. Punch inoculation assay was carried out according to a method previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>). Briefly, 5-week-old CO-39 rice leaves were slightly wounded using mouse ear punch and 10 μL of conidia suspensions (5×10<sup>5</sup> conidia/mL containing 0.02% Tween-20) from the various strains were respectively dropped at the wounded regions. Then, both sides of each inoculated spot were sealed with scotch tape to sustain the spore suspension. The inoculated plants were kept in a growth chamber under the same conditions described above for 10 days. The disease lesions formed were scanned, and later analyzed using Adobe Photoshop software to measure the lesion areas. For leaf sheaths inoculation, conidia suspensions (1×10<sup>5</sup> conidia/mL) from the various strains were respectively injected into 4-5 weeks old CO-39 rice leaf sheaths. The epidermal parts of the infected leaves were trimmed to thin and transparent samples for observation under a light microscope at 32 hpi. At least 100 infected sites were observed using a Nikon A1 laser confocal microscope (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan).</p>

<title>qRT-PCR analysis</title>
<p>To analyze the expression level of <italic>PPE1</italic> during <italic>M. oryzae</italic> infection, rice leaf sheaths were cut from 4-to 5-week-old CO-39 rice seedings and inoculated with conidia suspensions (2×10<sup>5</sup> conidia/mL) from the wild type (70–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>). The epidermal parts of the inoculated sheaths were cut and collected at 12-, 36- and 48 hours post inoculation (hpi). At least 15 segments of the inoculated rice sheath samples were collected at each time point. Total RNAs were extracted from the leaf sheaths or rice seeding leaves using an Eastep Super Total RNA Extraction Kit (Cat. no. LS1040, Promega, Shanghai, China). Reverse transcription was used to generate cDNA using a reverse transcription kit (Cat. no. RR037B, Takara, Dalian, China). Quantitative PCR was finally conducted using a SYBR kit (Cat. no. RR067A, Takara, Dalian, China) using specific primers (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbls2">Table S2</xref>). Fugal <italic>β-TUBULIN</italic> gene used as endogenous reference genes, and the expression levels were calculated using 2<sup>−ΔΔCt</sup> method as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>). All qRT-PCR assays were repeated three times for each sample.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This study focuses on characterizing a previously identified gene, encoding the secreted protein Ppe1, that may play a role in rice infection by the blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae. Magnaporthe oryzae is a hemibiotrophic fungus that infects living host cells before causing disease. Infection begins with the development of a specialized infection cell, the appressorium, on the host leaf surface. The appressorium generates enormous internal turgor that acts on a thin penetration peg at the appressorial base, forcing it through the leaf cuticle. Once through this barrier, the peg elaborates into bulbous invasive hyphae that colonizes the first infected cell before moving to neighboring cells via plasmodesmata. During this initial biotrophic growth stage, invasive hyphae invaginate the host plasma membrane, which surrounds growing hyphae as the extra-invasive hyphae membrane (EIHM). To avoid detection, the fungus secretes apoplastic effectors into the EIHM matrix via the conventional ER-Golgi secretion pathway. The fungus also forms a plant-derived structure called the biotrophic interfacial complex (BIC) that receives cytoplasmic effectors through an unconventional secretion route before they are delivered into the host cell. Together, these secreted effector proteins act to evade or suppress host innate immune responses. Here the authors contribute to our understanding of M. oryzae infection biology by showing how Ppe1, which localizes to both the appressorial penetration peg and to the appressorial-like transpressoria associated with invasive hyphal movements into adjacent cells, maximizes host cell penetration and disease development and is thus a novel contributor to rice blast disease.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>A major goal of M. oryzae research is to understand how the fungus causes disease, either by determining the physiological underpinnings of the fungal infection cycle or by identifying effectors and their host targets. Such new knowledge may point the way to novel mitigation strategies. Here, the authors make an interesting discovery that bridges both fungal physiology and effector biology research by showing how a secreted protein Ppe1, initially considered an effector with potential host targets, associates with its own penetration peg (and transpressoria) to facilitate host invasion. In a previous study, the authors had identified a small family of small secreted proteins that may function as effectors. Here they suggest Ppe1 (and, later in the manuscript, Ppe2/3/5) localizes outside the penetration peg when appressoria develops on surfaces that permit penetration, but not on artificial hard surfaces that prevent peg penetration. Deleting the PPE1 gene reduced (although did not abolish) penetration, and a fraction of those that penetrated developed invasive hyphae that were reduced in growth compared to WT. Using fluorescent markers, the authors show that Ppe1 forms a ring underneath appressoria, likely where the peg emerges, which remained after invasive hyphae had developed. The ring structure is smaller than the width of the appressorium and also lies within the septin ring known to form during peg development. This so-called penetration ring also formed at the transpressorial penetration point as invasive hyphae moved to adjacent cells. This structure is novel, and required for optimum penetration during infection. Furthermore, Ppe1, which carries a functional signal peptide, may form on the periphery of the peg, together suggesting it is secreted and associated with the peg to facilitate penetration. Staining with aniline blue also suggests Ppe1 is outside the peg. Together, the strength of the work lies in identifying a novel appressorial penetration ring structure required for full virulence.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The main weakness of the paper is that, although Ppe1 is associated with the peg and optimizes penetration, the function of Ppe1 is not known. The work starts off considering Ppe1 a secreted effector, then a facilitator of penetration by associating with the peg, but what role it plays here is only often speculated about. For example, the authors consider at various times that it may have a structural role, a signaling role orchestrating invasive hyphae development, or a tethering role between the peg and the invaginated host plasma membrane (called throughout the host cytoplasmic membrane, a novel term that is not explained). However, more effort should be expended to determine which of these alternative roles is the most likely. Otherwise, as it stands, the paper describes an interesting phenomenon (the appressorial ring) but provides no understanding of its function.</p>
<p>The inability to nail down the function of Ppe1 likely stems from two underlying assumptions with weak support. Firstly, the authors assume that Ppe1 is secreted and associated with the peg to form a penetration ring between the plant cell wall and cytoplasm membrane. However, the authors do not demonstrate it is secreted (for instance by blocking Ppe1 secretion and its association with the peg using brefeldin A). Also, they do not sufficiently show that Ppe1 localizes on the periphery of the peg. This is because confocal microscopy is not powerful enough to see the peg. The association they are seeing (for example in Figure 4) shows localization to the bottom of the appressorium and around the primary hyphae, but the peg cannot be seen. Here, the authors will need to use SEM, perhaps in conjunction with gold labeling of Ppe1, to show it is associating with the peg and, indeed, is external to the peg (rather than internal, as a structural role in peg rigidity might predict). It would also be interesting to repeat the microscopy in Figure 4C but at much earlier time points, just as the peg is penetrating but before invasive hyphae have developed - Where is Ppe1 then? Finally, the authors speculate, but do not show, that Ppe1 anchors penetration pegs on the plant cytoplasm membrane. Doing so may require FM4-64 staining, as used in Figure 2 of Kankanala et al, 2007 (DOI: 10.1105/tpc.106.046300), to show connections between Ppe1 and host membranes. Note that the authors also do not show that the penetration ring is a platform for effector delivery, as speculated in the Discussion.</p>
<p>Secondly, the authors assume Ppe1 is required for host infection due to its association with the peg. However, its role in infection is minor. The majority of appressoria produced by the mutant strain penetrate host cells and elaborate invasive hyphae, and lesion sizes are only marginally reduced compared to WT (in fact, the lesion density of the 70-15 WT strain itself seems reduced compared to what would be expected from this strain). The authors did not analyze the lesions for spores to confirm that the mutant strains were non-pathogenic (non-pathogenic mutants sometimes form small pinprick-like lesions that do not sporulate). Thus, the pathogenicity phenotype of the knockout mutant is weak, which could contribute to the inability to accurately define the molecular and cellular function of Ppe1.</p>
<p>In summary, it is important that the role of Ppe1 in infection be determined.</p>

<p>The article focuses on the study of Magnaporthe oryzae, the fungal pathogen responsible for rice blast disease, which poses a significant threat to global food security. The research delves into the infection mechanisms of the pathogen, particularly the role of penetration pegs and the formation of a penetration ring in the invasion process. The study highlights the persistent localization of Ppe1 and its homologs to the penetration ring, suggesting its function as a structural feature that facilitates the transition of penetration pegs into invasive hyphae. The article provides a thorough examination of the infection process of M. oryzae, from the attachment of conidia to the development of appressoria and the formation of invasive hyphae. The discovery of the penetration ring as a structural element that aids in the invasion process is a significant contribution to the understanding of plant-pathogen interactions. The experimental methods are well-documented, allowing for reproducibility and validation of the results.</p>
