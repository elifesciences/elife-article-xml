<title>Abstract</title><p>Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic and relapsing immune-mediated disorder characterized by intestinal inflammation and epithelial injury. The underlying causes of IBD are not fully understood, but genetic factors have implicated in genome-wide association studies, including CTLA-4, an essential negative regulator of T cell activation. However, establishing a direct link between CTLA-4 and IBD has been challenging due to the early lethality of CTLA-4 knockout mice. In this study, we identified zebrafish Ctla-4 homolog and investigated its role in maintaining intestinal immune homeostasis by generating a Ctla-4-deficient (<italic>ctla-4<sup>−/−</sup></italic>) zebrafish line. These mutant zebrafish exhibited reduced weight, along with impaired epithelial barrier integrity and lymphocytic infiltration in their intestines. Transcriptomics analysis revealed upregulation of inflammation-related genes, disturbing immune system homeostasis. Moreover, single-cell RNA-sequencing analysis indicated increased Th2 cells and interleukin 13 expression, along with decreased innate lymphoid cells and upregulated proinflammatory cytokines. Additionally, Ctla-4-deficient zebrafish exhibited reduced diversity and an altered composition of the intestinal microbiota. All these phenotypes closely resemble those found in mammalian IBD. Lastly, supplementation with Ctla-4-Ig successfully alleviated intestinal inflammation in these mutants. Altogether, our findings demonstrate the pivotal role of Ctla-4 in maintaining intestinal homeostasis. Additionally, they offer substantial evidence linking CTLA-4 to IBD and establish a novel zebrafish model for investigating both the pathogenesis and potential treatments.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis, refers to a group of chronic relapsing inflammation disorders affecting the gastrointestinal tract, that have been increasing in prevalence worldwide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>]. The precise etiology of IBD has yet to be fully elucidated. Conventional epidemiological studies have indicated that IBD tends to run in families and is linked to genetic factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>]. However, research also suggested that susceptibility gene patterns differ significantly among various geographic populations. Current evidence points towards a complicated interaction involving host genetics, disrupted intestinal microbiota, environmental triggers, and abnormal immune responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>]. Advances in genomic sequencing techniques have allowed for the identification of genetic variants associated with an increased risk of developing IBD. Among these, mutations in immune-related genes have received particular attention. Research on humans with Crohn’s disease and mouse models of IBD has shown that genetically susceptible individuals exhibit defects in intracellular pattern-recognition receptors (PRRS), such as toll-like receptors (TLR) and nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptors (NLRs), which are responsible for initiating innate immune responses to eliminate harmful bacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>]. Genetic variations in the tumor necrosis factor ligand superfamily member 15 (TNFSF15) and interleukin 23 receptor (IL23R) genes, both involved in suppressing inflammation, have been associated with an increased risk of developing Crohn’s disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>].</p>
<p>Cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA-4), also known as CD152, is one of the most well-established immune checkpoint molecules expressed predominantly on T cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>]. It primarily regulates the early stages of T-cell activation by attenuating downstream signaling of the T cell receptor (TCR) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>]. Specifically, CTLA-4 has a much higher affinity for CD80 and CD86 ligands compared to the co-stimulatory receptor CD28 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>]. By outcompeting CD28 for ligand binding, CTLA-4 provides an inhibitory signal that impacts immunological synapse formation and inhibits T-cell proliferation and activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>]. The immunomodulatory role of CTLA-4 in maintaining immune homeostasis is highlighted through CTLA-4 knockout studies. Germline CTLA-4-deficient is lethal for mice within 3 to 4 weeks due to massive T lymphocyte proliferation and the release of inflammatory cytokines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>]. Compared to wild-type T lymphocytes, CTLA-4-deficient T lymphocytes exhibit accelerated development of Th2 cells, leading to significantly enhanced secretion of IL-4 and IL-5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>]. Additionally, conditional deletion of CTLA-4 in adult mice results in rapid immune activation, multiorgan lymphocyte infiltration, and autoantibody production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>]. Moreover, a selective deficiency of CTLA-4 in Treg cells is sufficient to induce lymphoproliferation and autoimmune diseases in mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>]. Similarly, associations between polymorphic alleles of CTLA-4 and IBD in humans have been reported in multiple studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>]. Moreover, CTLA-4 is an intriguing target for novel immune checkpoint blockade therapies in cancer treatment, while intestinal inflammation is a common side effect in these clinical trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>]. Establishing a direct causal relationship between CTLA-4 and IBD has been challenging due to difficulties in finding appropriate models. The early lethality observed in CTLA-4-deficient mice added another layer of complexity to this issue. Zebrafish is a powerful model system for immunological and biomedical research, due to its versatility and high degree of conservation in innate and adaptive immunities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>]. In our current study, we identified the Ctla-4 homology in zebrafish and successfully developed an adult vertebrate model with homozygous knockout of the <italic>ctla-4</italic> gene for the first time. These <italic>ctla-4</italic>-deficient (<italic>ctla-4<sup>−/−</sup></italic>) zebrafish survive but exhibit attenuated growth and weight loss. Notably, <italic>ctla-4</italic> deficiency leads to an IBD-like phenotype in zebrafish characterized by altered intestinal epithelial cells morphology, abnormal inflammatory response, defects in microbial stratification and composition. Mechanistically, Ctla-4 exerts its inhibitory function by competing with Cd28 for binding to Cd80/86. These findings establish the <italic>ctla-4</italic> knockout zebrafish as an innovative platform to elucidate CTLA-4 immunobiology, model human IBD, and develop novel therapeutic modalities.</p>

<title>Identification of zebrafish Ctla-4</title>
<p>Through a homology search in the NCBI database, we identified the <italic>ctla-4</italic> gene (XM_005167519.4) on zebrafish chromosome 9, which exhibits an exon organization comparable to that of the human CTLA-4 gene (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1A-C</xref>). Zebrafish Ctla-4 is predicted to be a type I transmembrane protein with a molecular weight of approximately 33 kDa, featuring structural characteristics of the immunoglobulin superfamily, which include an N-terminal signal peptide, a single IgV-like extracellular domain, a transmembrane region, and a cytoplasmic tail (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). Multiple amino acid sequence alignments revealed that Ctla-4 contains a <sup>113</sup>LFPPPY<sup>118</sup> motif within the ectodomain and a tyrosine-based <sup>206</sup>YVKF<sup>209</sup> motif in the distal C-terminal region (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). These motifs closely resemble the MYPPPY and YVKM motifs found in mammalian CTLA-4 homologs, which are essential for binding to CD80/CD86 ligands, as well as molecular internalization and signaling inhibition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>]. The IgV-like domain of Ctla-4 was characterized by two-layer β-sandwich and was conserved between zebrafish and humans (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>). In contrast, zebrafish Cd28 features a SYPPPF motif in its extracellular region and a FYIQ motif in its intracellular tail, distinguishing it from Ctla-4. Additionally, zebrafish Ctla-4, similar to its counterparts in other species, carries a conserved extracellular <sup>123</sup>GNGT<sup>126</sup> motif, which is absent in zebrafish Cd28 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>]. This structural distinction further differentiates Ctla-4 from Cd28 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.1A</xref>, <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1D</xref>). Consistent with this, phylogenetic analysis showed that Ctla-4 clusters with other known CTLA-4 homologs from different species with high bootstrap probability, whereas zebrafish Cd28 groups separately with other CD28s (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1C</xref>). Structurally, Ctla-4 exists as a dimer, and unlike the intracellular localization of CTLA-4 in mammals, Ctla-4 is found on the cell membrane (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C and D</xref>). By analyzing the splenic scRNA-seq dataset we recently established [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>], Ctla-4 was primarily expressed on the T cells, including the Cd4<sup>+</sup> T and Cd8<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>). This result was verified by immunofluorescence assays on the splenic leukocytes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F</xref>).</p>

<title>Ctla-4 deficiency induces inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)-like phenotype</title>
<p>To further investigate the function of Ctla-4, we generated a <italic>ctla-4</italic><sup>−/−</sup> zebrafish line with a 14-base deletion in the second exon of the <italic>ctla-4</italic> gene (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A-C</xref>). The zebrafish appeared grossly normal in appearance; however, the body weight and size were significantly reduced compared with those of wild-type zebrafish (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D and E</xref>). Anatomically, the <italic>ctla-4<sup>−/−</sup></italic> zebrafish were featured by intestine shortening and splenomegaly, suggesting the occurrence of chronic inflammation in the intestines (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2F and G</xref>). For clarification, we first performed histological analysis on the anterior, mid, and posterior intestine segments using H&amp;E staining. Compared to the wild-type zebrafish, the <italic>ctla-4</italic><sup>−/−</sup> fish exhibited significant epithelial hyperplasia in the anterior intestine segment, accompanied with a small amount of mucosal inflammatory cell infiltration (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2H</xref>). Moreover, a noteworthy goblet cell loss, reduction of normal mucins and the accumulation of acidic mucins were also observed in <italic>ctla-4</italic><sup>−/−</sup> anterior intestine, as detected through Alcian Blue and Periodic Acid-Schiff (AB-PAS) or PAS staining (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2I and J</xref>, <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3A</xref>). A small amount of lymphocytic infiltration and mild epithelial damage occurred in the mid intestine segment of <italic>ctla-4</italic><sup>−/−</sup> zebrafish (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2H</xref>). In posterior intestine of <italic>ctla-4</italic><sup>−/−</sup> fish, the intestinal villi were markedly shortened, the epithelial barrier showed severely disrupted, and the intestinal wall became thinner, wherein the mucosal and transmural inflammatory cells were significantly infiltrated (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2H</xref>). Notably, the intestinal lumens in all three intestinal segments were enlarged in the ctla-4<sup>−/−</sup> zebrafish, and the ratio between the length of the intestinal villi and the intestinal ring radius was higher in the ctla-4<sup>−/−</sup> zebrafish intestines compared to those in wild-type zebrafish (Figure S3B). In addition, the ultrastructure analysis revealed that the epithelial cells of posterior intestine in <italic>ctla-4</italic><sup>−/−</sup> zebrafish exhibited alteration in tight junction, the loss of adhesion junctions and desmosomes, and disruption of microvilli (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2K</xref>). All these results strongly indicate that Ctla-4 plays a crucial role in preserving intestinal homeostasis in zebrafish. The intestinal phenotype resulting from Ctla-4 deficiency was similar to IBD in mammals.</p>

<title>Molecular mechanisms of Ctla-4 deficiency-induced IBD-like phenotype</title>
<p>To explore the potential molecular mechanisms of Ctla-4 deficiency-induced IBD-like phenotype, we performed transcriptome profiling analysis of intestines from wild-type and <italic>ctla-4</italic><sup>−/−</sup> zebrafish. We identified a total of 1,140 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), among which 714 genes were up-regulated, and 426 genes were down-regulated in <italic>ctla-4</italic><sup>−/−</sup> zebrafish (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A and B</xref>). GO enrichment analysis showed that DEGs or up-regulated genes in the top 10 enriched biological processes were associated with the immune response and inflammatory response (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C and D</xref>). Moreover, the KEGG enrichment analyses indicated that the up-regulated DEGs are primarily involved in the process of cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction and cell adhesion molecules, which are also related to inflammation (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Fig. S4A</xref>); however, the down-regulated DEGs were significantly enriched in the process of metabolism (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Fig. S4B</xref>). The intestines of <italic>ctla-4</italic><sup>−/−</sup> zebrafish showed significant upregulation of <italic>il1b</italic>, <italic>tnfa</italic>, myeloid-specific peroxidase (<italic>mpx</italic>), matrix metallopeptidase 9 (<italic>mmp9</italic>), chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 8a (<italic>cxcl8a</italic>), and <italic>il13</italic>. In contrast, <italic>il10</italic>, a potent anti-inflammatory cytokine, was markedly down-regulated in Ctla-4-deficient intestines (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E</xref>). The transcriptional change of these genes was confirmed by RT-qPCR (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3F</xref>). By constructing the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network, we found that <italic>il1b</italic> was a major cytokine that played a hub role in promoting the bowel inflammation of <italic>ctla-4</italic><sup>−/−</sup> zebrafish (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3G</xref>). Moreover, Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) showed that genes involved in the lymphocyte chemotaxis, positive regulation of ERK1 and ERK2 cascade, Calcium and MAPK signaling pathways were positively enriched in <italic>ctla-4</italic><sup>−/−</sup> zebrafish intestines, implying a sensitized or activated state of lymphocytes due to the absence of Ctla-4 (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Fig. S4C</xref> and <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">D</xref>). Notably, biological processes related to neutrophil activation and chemotaxis were significantly enriched (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C and D</xref>). Studies have shown that neutrophils can induce histopathological effects through releasing matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), neutrophil elastase, and myeloperoxidase (MPO) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>]. To confirm the association between neutrophils and Ctla-4-deficient intestinal inflammation, the MPO level was examined. As a support, MPO activity was markedly increased in the intestines and peripheral blood of <italic>ctla-4</italic><sup>−/−</sup> zebrafish (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3H</xref>). Besides, a number of biological markers or susceptibility genes of IBD observed in mammals, including c-reactive protein 6 (<italic>crp6</italic>), <italic>crp7</italic>, MMPs, haptoglobin, <italic>il23r</italic>, insulin-like growth factor binding protein 1 a (<italic>igfbp1a</italic>), cAMP responsive element modulator b (<italic>cremb</italic>) and lymphocyte specific protein 1 b (<italic>lsp1b</italic>), were highly expressed in the <italic>ctla-4</italic><sup>−/−</sup> zebrafish (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3I and J</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>], suggesting the presence of a conserved molecular network underlying IBD pathogenesis between <italic>ctla-4</italic><sup>−/−</sup> zebrafish and mammalian models.</p>

<title>Cellular mechanisms of Ctla-4 deficiency-induced IBD-like phenotype</title>
<p>To investigate the cellular mechanisms underlying the IBD-like phenotype induced by Ctla-4 deficiency, we performed scRNA-seq analysis on intestines from wild-type and <italic>ctla-4</italic><sup>−/−</sup> zebrafish using the 10× Genomics Chromium platform. We obtained nine discrete clusters from 7,539 cells of wild-type and <italic>ctla-4</italic><sup>−/−</sup> zebrafish (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>). These clusters of cells were classified as enterocytes, enteroendocrine cells, smooth muscle cells, neutrophils, macrophages, B cells, and a group of T/NK/ILC-like cells based on their co-expression of lineage marker genes (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B and C</xref>, <xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Fig. S6A</xref> and <xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">B</xref>). Due to severe epithelial disruption and inflammatory cell infiltration in <italic>ctla-4</italic><sup>−/−</sup> zebrafish intestines, we focused on the pathological process and immune reactions in enterocytes and immune cell populations. KEGG analysis showed that apoptotic pathway was highly enriched in enterocytes of <italic>ctla4</italic><sup>−/−</sup> zebrafish, suggesting that aberrant apoptosis contributes to the epithelial injury (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Fig. S6C</xref>). Subsequently, we conducted a TUNEL assay to detect apoptosis in the posterior intestines from both wild-type and <italic>ctla4</italic><sup>−/−</sup> zebrafish. The results showed a higher number of apoptotic cells in the intestines of <italic>ctla4</italic><sup>−/−</sup> zebrafish (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Fig. S6D</xref>). Additionally, genes functionally involved in the formation of tight and adhesion junctions, such as <italic>oclna</italic>, <italic>cdh1</italic>, <italic>pcdh1b</italic> and <italic>cldn15a</italic>, were significantly down-regulated in enterocytes of <italic>ctla-4</italic><sup>−/−</sup> zebrafish (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref>), consistent with the pathological observation under electron microscope. Furthermore, inflammation-related genes and pathways were significantly up-regulated and enriched in neutrophils, B cells, and macrophages of <italic>ctla-4</italic><sup>−/−</sup> zebrafish, suggesting active inflammatory responses (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E-G</xref>, <xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Fig. S6E</xref>). By sub-clustering analysis, six subpopulations were classified from T/NK/ILC-like cell groups based on their expression with a set of marker genes. These subpopulations include Cd8<sup>+</sup> T cells, ILC3-like cells, maturing Ccr7<sup>high</sup> T cells, NKT-like cells, and two groups of Th2 cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A-C</xref>, <xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Fig. S7A</xref>). The abundances of NKT-like and two subsets of Th2 cells were significantly increased in the intestines of <italic>ctla-4</italic><sup>−/−</sup> zebrafish (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D-F</xref>). These findings were further validated by RT-qPCR detection of their corresponding marker genes (<xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Fig. S7B</xref> and <xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">C</xref>). These cells exhibited high expression levels of <italic>il13</italic> (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5G and H</xref>). Specifically, the second subset of Th2 cells was seldom observed in the intestine of wild-type zebrafish, indicating their unique role in the pathogenesis of IBD-like phenotype in <italic>ctla-4</italic><sup>−/−</sup> zebrafish (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D-F</xref>). KEGG analysis of up-regulated genes from <italic>ctla-4</italic><sup>−/−</sup> NKT-like and Th2 cells indicated that Ctla-4 deficiency is positively associated with the inflammatory cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, PPAR, calcium and MAPK signaling pathways, cellular adhesion and mucosal immune responses (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5I and J</xref>, <xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Fig. S7D</xref>). Although the abundance of Cd8<sup>+</sup> T cells was not significantly changed in Ctla-4-deficient intestines, the inflammatory genes and pathways were up-regulated and enriched in the subset of T cells (<xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Fig. S7E</xref> and <xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">F</xref>). Notably, the proportion of ILC3-like cells was decreased, and they highly expressed <italic>il17a/f1</italic> and <italic>il17a/f3</italic> in the Ctla-4-deficient intestines (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D-F</xref>, and K). Investigations have consistently reported a substantial decline in the population of ILC3s within the inflamed intestines and IL-17A-secreting ILC3s play a significant role in the development of intestinal inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>]. Thus, the reduced ILC3-like cells and increased expression of <italic>il17a/f1</italic> and <italic>il17a/f3</italic> may be responsible for intestinal inflammation induced by Ctla-4 deficiency.</p>

<title>Decreased microbiota diversity in <italic>ctla-4</italic><sup>−/−</sup> zebrafish intestines</title>
<p>The intestinal microbiota plays a crucial role in host functions such as nutrient acquisition, metabolism, epithelial cell development and immunity. Notably, lower microbiota diversity has consistently been observed in patients with IBD phenotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>], making it a valuable indicator of host health. Therefore, we further analyzed whether microbes are involved in the Ctla-4-deficiency induced intestinal inflammation. The results revealed a significantly higher number of amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) in wild-type zebrafish intestines, with 730 ASVs unique to the wild-type group and 276 ASVs exclusively found in <italic>ctla-4</italic><sup>−/−</sup> group (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>). Furthermore, the Shannon index and the Simpson index indicated a decreased microbial diversity in <italic>ctla-4</italic><sup>−/−</sup> zebrafish intestines (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref>) and the Principal Coordinate Analysis (PCoA) using Bray Curtis distance revealed a significant separation in the microbial composition between <italic>ctla-4</italic><sup>−/−</sup> group and the wild-type group (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C</xref>). To gain insights into the microbial community composition, we analyzed the identified microbial populations at the class and family level. Alphaproteobacteria and Gammaproteobacteria were found to be the most prevalent classes. Relative to wild-type group, Ctla-4 deficiency resulted in a significant reduction in Alphaproteobacteria abundance. However, the Gammaproteobacteria, one of the main classes of Gamma-negative pathogenic bacteria expanded under inflammation conditions, was increased, although the change did not reach statistical significance (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6D and E</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>]. In addition, we observed a decreased relative abundance of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs)-producing Bacilli and Verrucomicrobiae, the latter of which contributes to glucose homeostasis and intestinal health (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6F and G</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>]. Notably, the family-level analysis revealed a notable enrichment of Enterobacteriaceae, overgrowing under host inflammatory conditions, and the Shewanellaceae, serving as the most important secondary or opportunistic pathogens, in <italic>ctla-4</italic><sup>−/−</sup> zebrafish (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6H and I</xref>). To identify differentially abundant bacterial taxa between the wild-type and <italic>ctla-4<sup>−/−</sup></italic> zebrafish, we conducted Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) effect size (LEfSe). The results showed that several potentially opportunistic pathogens, including Gammaproteobacteria, Enterobacterales, and Aeromonadales were found to be overrepresented in <italic>ctla-4<sup>−/−</sup></italic> zebrafish (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6J</xref>). In contrast, Actinobacteriota, Cetobacterium, and Planctomycetota (Planctomycetes) were more abundant in the wild-type zebrafish. These findings strongly indicated an association between Ctla-4 deficiency-induced gut inflammation and dysbiosis, as characterized by decreased microbial diversity, loss of potentially beneficial bacteria, and expansion of pathobionts.</p>

<title>Inhibitory role of Ctla-4 in T cell activation</title>
<p>Given that Ctla-4 is primarily expressed on T cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E-F</xref>), its absence has been shown to induce intestinal immune dysregulation, indicating a crucial role of this molecule as a conserved immune checkpoint in T cell inhibition. Mechanistically, Ctla-4 may inhibit T cell activation by obstructing the Cd80/86-Cd28 costimulatory pathway, a mechanism conserved in mammalian species. To elucidate the regulatory role of Ctla-4 in costimulatory signal-dependent T cell activation, we conducted a series of blockade and activation assays using anti-Ctla-4 antibody, recombinant soluble Ctla-4-Ig (sCtla-4-Ig), sCd28-Ig, and sCd80/86 proteins in a PHA-stimulating and mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR) model. In this system, sCtla-4-Ig and sCd28-Ig served as antagonists to block membrane-bound Cd80/86, while sCd80/86 acted as an agonist for membrane-bound Cd28 (<xref rid="figs8" ref-type="fig">Fig. S8A-C</xref>). As expected, the proliferation of lymphocytes from <italic>ctla-4</italic><sup>−/−</sup> zebrafish was more pronounced compared to wild-type controls, and the addition of sCtla-4-Ig effectively suppressed this proliferation (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7A and B</xref>). These findings indicate that the absence of Ctla-4 leads to enhanced lymphocyte activation, which can be counteracted by sCtla-4 administration, underscoring the inhibitory function of Ctla-4 in T cell regulation. Consistent with these results, blockade of Ctla-4 using anti-Ctla-4 Ab significantly promoted the proliferation of lymphocytes from wild-type zebrafish (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7C</xref>). Furthermore, sCd28-Ig administration inhibited the proliferation of lymphocytes from <italic>ctla-4</italic><sup>−/−</sup> zebrafish (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7D</xref>), whereas sCd80/86 promoted the expansion of Ctla-4-deficient lymphocytes (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7E</xref>). Based on these results, we concluded that the presence of Ctla-4 obstructs the Cd80/86-Cd28 mediated costimulatory signaling, consequently impeding cell proliferation. To further investigate the molecular interactions between Cd28, Ctla-4, and Cd80/86, we employed AlphaFold2 to predict the structures of Cd80/86-Cd28 and Cd80/86-Ctla-4 complexes. A total of 25 models were generated for each complex and subsequently aligned with Cd80/86. The predictions indicated that both Cd28 and Ctla-4 form a well-defined interface with Cd80/86, utilizing the same binding site (<xref rid="figs8" ref-type="fig">Fig. S8D</xref> and <xref rid="figs8" ref-type="fig">E</xref>). This well-defined interface was corroborated by lower predicted aligned error (PAE) scores for each model, as marked by the red dashed square (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7F and G</xref>). Subsequently, co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) assays were conducted to provide compelling evidence for the molecular interactions between Cd80/86 and Cd28 or Ctla-4. Flow cytometry analysis further revealed dose-dependent associations between Cd80/86 and Cd28 or Ctla-4 in HEK293T cells (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7H</xref>, S8F). Additionally, microscale thermophoresis assays demonstrated that Ctla-4 exhibits a higher binding affinity for Cd80/86 than Cd28, as evidenced by a lower equilibrium association constant value (K<sub>D</sub> = 0.50 ± 0.25 μM vs. K<sub>D</sub> = 2.64 ± 0.45 μM) (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7I</xref>). These findings suggest that Ctla-4 exerts its inhibitory function by competing with Cd28 for binding Cd80/86.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>As an essential negative regulator of T cell activation, dysfunction of CTLA-4 was implicated in various diseases in both humans and murine models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>]. Numerous previous studies have established the connection between CTLA-4 and autoimmune thyroiditis, Graves’ disease, myocarditis, pancreatitis, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, and type I diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>]. However, the involvement of CTLA-4 in IBD has been understudied. Several investigations have reported that haploinsufficiency resulting from mutations in CTLA-4 in humans is associated with IBD, and genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have implicated CTLA-4 as a susceptibility gene for IBD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref>]. Nevertheless, the exact contributions and mechanisms of CTLA-4 deficiency in the occurrence and pathology of IBD remain incompletely understood, primarily due to the lack of animal models attributable to the lethality of CTLA-4 knockout in mice. In this study, we identified the Ctla-4 homolog in zebrafish, and discovered that defect in Ctla-4 did not have a severe lethal effect, but did show a clear IBD-like phenotype. This makes zebrafish an attractive animal model for investigating the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying Ctla-4 mediated IBD.</p>
<p>Multiple lines of histopathological evidence demonstrated the IBD-like phenotype in Ctla-4-deficienct zebrafish. Key features include epithelial hyperplasia, disruption of epithelial integrity, loss of goblet cells, increased acidic mucus production, intestinal lumen enlargement, inflammatory cell infiltration, and elevated expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the inflamed intestines. These characteristics, such as epithelial hyperplasia, goblet cell depletion, inflammatory cell infiltration, and upregulated pro-inflammatory cytokine expression, closely resemble those observed in the dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced IBD model in mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref>]. Similarly, mononuclear cell infiltration and significant upregulation of the il1β cytokine have been reported in the trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced IBD model in adult zebrafish [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref>]. In zebrafish larvae, the TNBS-induced IBD-like phenotype also exhibits an enlarged intestinal lumen, although goblet cell numbers were increased [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref>]. Additionally, neutrophilic inflammation and acidic mucin accumulation have been observed in the DSS-induced enterocolitis model in zebrafish larvae [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref>]. In contrast, the soybean meal-induced enteritis (SBMIE) phenotype in zebrafish larvae shows no significant structural changes in intestinal architecture, despite an increased number of neutrophils and lymphocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref>]. In summary, Ctla-4 deficiency induces IBD-like phenotypes analogous to those typically elicited by drugs in mice and zebrafish, making this model a valuable tool for comprehending the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying IBD.</p>
<p>A transcriptomics study was conducted to investigate the mechanisms of Ctla-4-deficiency induced IBD. RNA-seq analysis demonstrated a significant upregulation of important inflammatory cytokines, such as <italic>il1b</italic> and <italic>tnfa</italic> in the Ctla-4-deficient intestines. This is consistent with studies showing that IL-1β and TNF-α act as crucial mediators in mammalian IBD models by disrupting epithelial junctions and inducing apoptosis of epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref>]. Conversely, the key anti-inflammatory cytokines, such as <italic>il10</italic>, were downregulated. These findings highlight an imbalance between pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines in the intestines of Ctla-4-deficient fish. Consistently, the inflammatory signaling pathways associated with these upregulated cytokines, such as the ERK1/2 and MAPK pathways, were positively enriched in inflamed intestines. Single-cell RNA-seq analysis revealed the upregulation and enrichment of these inflammatory cytokines and pathways in neutrophils, macrophages, and B cells of inflamed intestines, indicating their active involvement in inflammatory responses and as major sources of inflammatory signals. Additionally, there was a marked increase in the abundance of Th2 subset cells in the inflamed intestines, these cells exhibited high expression of <italic>il13</italic> and were significantly enriched in inflammatory signaling pathways, indicating their activated state. These findings align with previous studies indicating that T cells in CTLA-4-deficient mice exhibit a bias toward Th2 differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>]. Furthermore, IL-13, a key effector Th2 cytokine, has been implicated in the pathogenesis of ulcerative colitis in mammals, where it directly contributes to epithelial cell damage by disrupting tight junctions, inducing apoptosis, and impairing cellular restitution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref>]. Therefore, upregulated Il13 from Th2 cells may be a significant contributor to the occurrence of intestine inflammation in Ctla-4-deficient zebrafish. Notably, the proportion of ILC3-like cells was downregulated in the inflamed intestines, consistent with recent studies reporting a substantial decline of ILC3 in IBD patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>]. ILC3 is the most abundant type of ILCs in the intestines and plays a protective role in IBD in mammals by promoting epithelial cell proliferation and survival, as well as enhancing intestinal barrier function through the production of IL-22 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>]. Thus, the marked decrease in ILC3-like cells may exacerbate intestinal inflammation and damage.</p>
<p>IBD is frequently associated with alterations in gut microbiota composition, characterized by reduced microbial diversity and an imbalance between beneficial and pathogenic bacteria. The common feature of these changes is the expansion of Proteobacteria, particularly members of the Enterobacteriaceae family [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref>]. Similarly, Ctla-4-deficient zebrafish exhibited significant enrichment of Enterobacteriaceae, alongside a decline in beneficial bacteria like Cetobacterium and an increase in opportunistic pathogens such as γ-Proteobacteria and Aeromonadales. These findings indicate shared patterns in microbial flora changes during intestinal inflammation. Previous studies suggest that reduced microbial diversity in IBD results from the loss of normal anaerobic bacteria, such as Bacteroides, Eubacterium, and Lactobacillus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">73</xref>]. Concurrently, inflammation-driven increases in intestinal lumen oxygenation and the availability of nitrate and host-derived electron acceptors facilitate anaerobic respiration and Enterobacteriaceae proliferation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">74</xref>]. These observations highlight the intricate interplay between IBD pathogenesis, gut microbial alterations, and host immune homeostasis. The zebrafish IBD-like model induced by Ctla-4 deficiency offers new insights into this research area. For instance, abnormal activation of Th2 cells may lead to dysfunction in downstream B cells and mucosa-associated immunity, which are crucial for maintaining symbiotic bacterial homeostasis in the intestines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>]. This suggests a potential link between Th2 cell changes and the observed alterations in the intestinal microbial community in Ctla-4-deficient zebrafish. Moreover, Ctla-4 deficiency alters the proportion and activation of ILC3 cells and damages the intestinal epithelium, potentially shaping the inflammatory milieu and further disrupting gut microbial homeostasis. Ctla-4 also regulates T cell activation by inhibiting the Cd80/86 co-stimulatory pathway. These findings suggest a regulatory interplay between Ctla-4, ILC3 cells, Cd80/86-primed T cells, and gut microbiota in Ctla-4 deficiency-induced IBD. Recently, gut microbiota exposure has been found to induce local IL-23 production, which upregulates CTLA-4 on ILC3s. This supports immune regulation by reducing CD80/86 co-stimulatory signaling and increasing PD-L1 bioavailability on myeloid cells. Impairment of this pathway manifests in a substantial imbalance of effector and regulatory T cell responses, exacerbating intestinal inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">75</xref>]. These findings bolster our hypothesis and provide valuable insights into the complex interactions between gut microbiota, ILC3-mediated immune responses, and Cd80/86 signaling in Ctla-4 deficiency-induced IBD.</p>
<p>In conclusion, our study demonstrates that Ctla-4 serves as a potential genetic determinant of the IBD-like phenotype in zebrafish, although further research is necessary to conclusively identify the causative variant responsible for this association. The development of this zebrafish model offers a valuable tool for elucidating the mechanisms underlying the disease’s pathophysiology. Nevertheless, a deeper understanding of the intricate interactions among immune cells, intestinal epithelial cells, and the microbiome in IBD remains an area warranting further investigation.</p>

<title>16S rRNA sequencing analysis</title>
<p>Intestinal contents were collected from both wild-type and <italic>ctla-4</italic><sup>−/−</sup> zebrafish by gently squeezing the intestines with fine-tipped tweezers, and the remaining intestines were used for single-cell RNA-sequencing analysis. Contents from six fish were pooled to form one replicate, with each experimental sample comprising four replicates. DNA was extracted from the samples using the CTAB method, a protocol known for its efficacy in isolating DNA from trace quantities. The quality of DNA was assessed through agarose gel electrophoresis. Total DNA was amplified to construct sequencing libraries using primers (341F: 5’-CCTACGGGNGGCWGCAG-3’; 805R: 5’-GACTACHVGGGTATCTAATCC-3’) targeting the V3-V4 regions of the 16S rRNA gene. The libraries were sequenced on an Illumina NovaSeq PE250 platform. Quality filtering was performed under specific conditions to obtain high-quality clean tags using fqtrim (v0.94). Chimeric sequences were removed using Vsearch software (v2.3.4). After dereplication using DADA2, a feature table and feature sequences were generated. Alpha diversity is applied in analyzing the complexity of species diversity for a sample through the Shannon and Simpson indices, with all calculations performed in QIIME2. Beta diversity analysis was also conducted in QIIME2, and the graphs were drawn by R package. Sequence alignment was performed using BLAST, and representative sequences were annotated using the SILVA database. Other diagrams were implemented using the R package (v3.5.2).</p>

<title>Prediction of protein interactions by AlphaFold2</title>
<p>AlphaFold2 (version 2.3.2; available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/google-deepmind/alphafold">https://github.com/google-deepmind/alphafold</ext-link>) was implemented on a high-performance computing cluster to predict the structures of the Cd80/86 complexes with Cd28 and Ctla-4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">85</xref>]. The resulting models were ranked based on their per-residue Local Distance Difference Test (pLDDT) scores, which quantify the confidence level of each residue on a scale from 0 to 100. Residues were color-coded according to their pLDDT scores, with higher values reflecting greater confidence in the prediction. Furthermore, the Predicted Aligned Error (PAE) scores were analyzed to identify well-defined interaction interfaces between Cd28 or Ctla-4 and Cd80/86.</p>

<title>Microscale thermophoresis assay</title>
<p>The binding affinity between Cd80/86 and Cd28/Ctla-4 were measured through microscale thermophoresis (MST) assays using a Monolith NT.115 instrument (Nano Temper Technologies) as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">86</xref>]. In each assay, the labeled proteins (Cd28/Ctla-4 with EGFP-tag) were incubated with varying concentrations of unlabeled ligand protein (Cd80/86) for 10 min at room temperature. The initial protein concentration of 3.2 µM was diluted into 16 different concentrations by doubling dilution. The samples were then loaded into capillaries and analyzed at 25℃ by using 40% light emitting diode (LED) and medium MST power. The binding affinities of Cd80/86 with Cd28 and Cd80/86 with Ctla-4 were examined using the same parameters. Each assay was repeated three to five times, and dissociation constants (K<sub>D</sub>) were calculated using MO.Affinity Analysis software.</p>

<p>This study focuses on the role of a T-cell-specific receptor, ctla-4, in a new zebrafish model of IBD-like phenotype. Although implicated in IBD diseases, the function of ctla-4 has been hard to study in mice as the KO is lethal. Ctla-4 mutant zebrafish exhibited significant intestinal inflammation and dysbiosis, mirroring the pathology of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in mammals, providing a new <bold>valuable</bold> model to the field of IBD research. This is an key study with <bold>convincing</bold> evidence, comprehensive transcriptomic analysis, histological examinations, and functional assays all supporting the findings.</p>

<p>&quot;Unraveling the Role of Ctla-4 in Intestinal Immune Homeostasis: Insights from a novel Zebrafish Model of Inflammatory Bowel Disease&quot; generates a 14bp deletion/early stop codon mutation that is viable in a zebrafish homolog of ctla-4. This mutant exhibits an IBD-like phenotype, including decreased intestinal length, abnormal intestinal folds, decreased goblet cells, abnormal cell junctions between epithelial cells, increased inflammation, and alterations in microbial diversity. Bulk and single-cell RNA-seq show upregulation of immune and inflammatory response genes in this mutant (especially in neutrophils, B cells, and macrophages) and downregulation of genes involved in adhesion and tight junctions in mutant enterocytes. The work suggests that the makeup of immune cells within the intestine is altered in these mutants, potentially due to changes in lymphocyte proliferation. Introduction of recombinant soluble Ctla-4-Ig to mutant zebrafish rescued body weight, histological phenotypes, and gene expression of several pro-inflammatory genes, suggesting a potential future therapeutic route.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>- Generation of a useful new mutant in zebrafish ctla-4</p>
<p>
- The demonstration of an IBD-like phenotype in this mutant is extremely comprehensive.</p>
<p>
- Demonstrated gene expression differences provide mechanistic insight into how this mutation leads to IBD-like symptoms.</p>
<p>
- Demonstration of rescue with a soluble protein suggests exciting future therapeutic potential</p>
<p>
- The manuscript is mostly well organized and well written.</p>
<p>Initial Weaknesses were addressed during review.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors aimed to elucidate the role of Ctla-4 in maintaining intestinal immune homeostasis by using a novel Ctla-4-deficient zebrafish model. This study addresses the challenge of linking CTLA-4 to inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) due to the early lethality of CTLA-4 knockout mice. Four lines of evidence were shown to show that Ctla-4-deficient zebrafish exhibited hallmarks of IBD in mammals: 1) impaired epithelial integrity and infiltration of inflammatory cells; 2) enrichment of inflammation-related pathways and the imbalance between pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines; 3) abnormal composition of immune cell populations; and 4) reduced diversity and altered microbiota composition. By employing various molecular and cellular analyses, the authors established ctla-4-deficient zebrafish as a convincing model of human IBD.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The characterization of the mutant phenotype is very thorough, from anatomical to histological and molecular levels. The finding effectively established ctla-4 mutants as a novel zebrafish model for investigating human IBD. Evidence from the histopathological and transcriptome analysis was very strong and supports a severe interruption of immune system homeostasis in the zebrafish intestine. Additional characterization using sCtla-4-Ig further probed the molecular mechanism of the inflammatory response, and provided a potential treatment plan for targeting Ctla-4 in IBD models.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>To probe the molecular mechanism of Ctla-4, the authors used a spectrum of antibodies that target Ctla-4 or its receptors. The phenotype assayed was lymphocyte proliferation, while it was the composition rather than number of immune cells that was observed to be different in the scRNASeq assay. Although sCtla-4 has an effect of alleviating the IBD-like phenotypes, I found this explanation a bit oversimplified.</p>
<p>Comments on revised version:</p>
<p>The authors have sufficiently addressed all my concerns and I don't have further suggestions.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Current study on the mutant zebrafish for IBD modeling is worth trying. The author provided lots of evidence, including histopathological observation, gut microflora, as well as intestinal tissue or mucosa cells' transcriptomic data. The multi-omic study has demonstrated the enteritis pathology at multi levels in zebrafish model.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The important immune checkpoint of Treg cells were knockout in zebrafish, and the enteritis were found then. It could be a substitution of mouse knockout model to investigate the molecular mechanism of gut disease.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) In Fig. 2I, as to the purple glycogen signals stained by PAS was ignored for the quantitative statistics. The purple stained area could be calculated by ImageJ.</p>
<p>
(2) Those characters in Fig. 3G are too small to recognize. It is suggested to adjusted this picture or just put it in the supplementation, with bigger size.</p>
<p>
(3) The tissue seems damaged for IgG ctrl in Fig. 8B. It is suggested to find another slice to present here.</p>
<p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer</bold> <bold>#1:</bold></p>
<p>The manuscript suggests the zebrafish homolog of ctla-4 and generates a new mutant in it. However, the locus that is mutated is confusingly annotated as both CD28 (current main annotation in ZFIN) and CTLA-4/CD152 (one publication from 2020), see: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://zfin.org/ZDB-GENE-070912-128">https://zfin.org/ZDB-GENE-070912-128</ext-link>. Both human CTLA-4 and CD28 align with relatively similar scores to this gene. There seem to be other orthologs of these receptors in the zebrafish genome, including CD28-like (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://zfin.org/ZDB-GENE-070912-309">https://zfin.org/ZDB-GENE-070912-309</ext-link>) which neighbors the gene annotated as CD28 (exhibiting similar synteny as human CD28 and CTLA-4). It would be helpful to provide more information to distinguish between this family of genes and to further strengthen the evidence that this mutant is in ctla-4, not cd28. Also, is one of these genes in the zebrafish genome (e.g. cd28l) potentially a second homolog of CTLA-4? Is this why this mutant is viable in zebrafish and not mammals? Some suggestions:</p>
<p>(a) A more extensive sequence alignment that considers both CTLA-4 and CD28, potentially identifying the best homolog of each human gene, especially taking into account any regions that are known to produce the functional differences between these receptors in mammals and effectively assigns identities to the two genes annotated as &quot;cd28&quot; and &quot;cd28l&quot; as well as the gene &quot;si:dkey-1H24.6&quot; that your CD28 ORF primers seem to bind to in zebrafish.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In response to the reviewer's insightful suggestions, we have conducted more extensive sequence alignment and phylogenetic analyses that consider both CTLA-4, CD28, and CD28-like molecules, taking into account key regions crucial for the functionalities and functional differences between these molecules across various species, including mammals and zebrafish.</p>
<p>Identification of zebrafish Ctla-4: We identified zebrafish Ctla-4 as a homolog of mammalian CTLA-4 based on key conserved structural and functional characteristics. Structurally, the Ctla-4 gene shares similar exon organization compared to mammalian CTLA-4. Ctla-4 is a type I transmembrane protein with typical immunoglobulin superfamily features. Multiple amino acid sequence alignments revealed that Ctla-4 contains a <sup>113</sup>LFPPPY<sup>118</sup> motif and a <sup>123</sup>GNGT<sup>126</sup> motif in the ectodomain, and a tyrosine-based <sup>206</sup>YVKF<sup>209</sup> motif in the distal C-terminal region. These motifs closely resemble MYPPPY, GNGT, and YVKM motifs in mammalian CTLA-4s, which are essential for binding to CD80/CD86 ligands and molecular internalization and signaling inhibition. Despite only 23.7% sequence identity to human CTLA-4, zebrafish Ctla-4 exhibits a similar tertiary structure with a two-layer β-sandwich architecture in its extracellular IgV-like domain. Four cysteine residues responsible for the formation of two pairs of disulfide bonds (Cys<sup>20</sup>-Cys<sup>91</sup>/Cys<sup>46</sup>-Cys<sup>65</sup> in zebrafish and Cys<sup>21</sup>-Cys<sup>92</sup>/Cys<sup>48</sup>-Cys<sup>66</sup> in humans) that connect the two-layer β-sandwich are conserved. Additionally, a separate cysteine residue (Cys<sup>120</sup> in zebrafish and Cys<sup>120</sup> in humans) involved in dimerization is also present, and Western blot analysis under reducing and non-reducing conditions confirmed Ctla-4’s dimerization. Phylogenetically, Ctla-4 clusters with other known CTLA-4 homologs from different species with high bootstrap probability, while zebrafish Cd28 groups separately with other CD28s. Functionally, Ctla-4 is predominantly expressed on CD4<sup>+</sup> T and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in zebrafish. It plays a pivotal inhibitory role in T cell activation by competing with CD28 for binding to CD80/86, as validated through a series of both <italic>in</italic> <italic>vitro</italic> and <italic>in</italic> <italic>vivo</italic> assays, including microscale thermophoresis assays which demonstrated that Ctla-4 exhibits a significantly higher affinity for Cd80/86 than Cd28 (KD = 0.50 ± 0.25 μM vs. KD = 2.64 ± 0.45 μM). These findings confirm Ctla-4 as an immune checkpoint molecule, reinforcing its identification within the CTLA-4 family.</p>
<p>Comparison between zebrafish Cd28 and &quot;Cd28l&quot;: Zebrafish Cd28 contains an extracellular SYPPPF motif and an intracellular FYIQ motif. The extracellular SYPPPF motif is essential for binding to Cd80/CD86, while the intracellular FYIQ motif likely mediates kinase recruitment and co-stimulatory signaling. In contrast, the &quot;Cd28l&quot; molecule lacks the SYPPPF motif, which is critical for Cd80/CD86 binding, and exhibits strong similarity in its C-terminal 79 amino acids to Ctla-4 rather than Cd28. Consequently, &quot;Cd28l&quot; resembles an atypical Ctla-4-like molecule but fails to exhibit Cd80/CD86 binding activity.</p>
<p>We have incorporated the relevant analysis results into the main text of the revised manuscript and updated Supplementary Figure 1. Additionally, we provide key supplementary analyses here for the reviewer's convenience.</p>

<p>(b) Clearer description in the main text of such an analysis to better establish that the mutated gene is a homolog of ctla-4, NOT cd28.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the reviewer's advice. Additional confirmation of zebrafish Ctla-4 is detailed in lines 119-126 of the revised manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(c) Are there mammalian anti-ctla-4 and/or anti-cd28 antibodies that are expected to bind to these zebrafish proteins? If so, looking to see whether staining is lost (or western blotting is lost) in your mutants could be additionally informative. (Our understanding is that your mouse anti-Ctla-4 antibody is raised against recombinant protein generated from this same locus, and so is an elegant demonstration that your mutant eliminates the production of the protein, but unfortunately does not contribute additional information to help establish its homology to mammalian proteins).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This suggestion holds significant value. However, a major challenge in fish immunology research is the limited availability of antibodies suitable for use in fish species; antibodies developed for mammals are generally not applicable. We attempted to use human and mouse anti-CTLA-4 and anti-CD28 antibodies to identify Ctla-4 and Cd28 in zebrafish, but the results were inconclusive, with no expected signals. This outcome likely arises from the low sequence identity between human/mouse CTLA-4 and CD28 and their zebrafish homologs (ranging from 21.3% to 23.7% for CTLA-4 and 21.2% to 24.0% for CD28). Therefore, developing specific antibodies against zebrafish Ctla-4 is essential for advancing this research.</p>

<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Figure 5 suggests that there are more Th2 cells 1, Th2 cells 2, and NKT cells in ctla-4 mutants through scRNA-seq. However, as the cell numbers for these are low in both genotypes, there is only a single replicate for each genotype scRNA-seq experiment, and dissociation stress can skew cell-type proportions, this finding would be much more convincing if another method that does not depend on dissociation was used to verify these results. Furthermore, while Th2 cells 2 are almost absent in WT scRNA-seq, KEGG analysis suggests that a major contributor to their clustering may be ribosomal genes (Fig. 5I). Since no batch correction was described in the methods, it would be beneficial to verify the presence of this cluster in ctla-4 mutants and WT animals through other means, such as in situ hybridization or transgenic lines.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We are grateful for the insightful comments provided by the reviewer. Given that research on T cell subpopulations in fish is still in its nascent stages, the availability of specific marker antibodies and relevant transgenic strains remains limited. Our single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis revealed that a distinct Th2 subset 2 was predominantly observed in Ctla-4 mutants but was rare in wild-type zebrafish, it suggests that this subset may primarily arise under pathological conditions associated with Ctla-4 mutation. Due to the near absence of Th2 subset 2 in wild-type samples, KEGG enrichment analysis was performed exclusively on this subset from Ctla-4-deficient intestines. The ribosome pathway was significantly enriched, suggesting that these cells may be activated to fulfill their effector functions. However, confirming the presence of Th2 subset 2 using in situ hybridization or transgenic zebrafish lines is currently challenging due to the lack of lineage-specific markers for detailed classification of Th2 cell subsets and the preliminary nature of scRNA-seq predictions.</p>
<p>To address the reviewers' suggestion to confirm compositional changes in Th2 and NKT cells using dissociation-independent methods, we quantified mRNA levels of Th2 (il4, il13, and gata3) and NKT (nkl.2, nkl.4, and prf1.1) cell marker genes via RT-qPCR in intestines from wild-type and mutant zebrafish. As shown in Figure S7B and S7C, these markers were significantly upregulated in Ctla-4-deficient intestines compared to wild-type controls. This indicates an overall increase in Th2 and NKT cell activity in mutant zebrafish, aligning with our scRNA-seq analysis and supports the validity of our initial findings.</p>
<p>Before analyzing the scRNA-seq data, we performed batch correction using the Harmony algorithm via cloud-based Cumulus v1.0 on the aggregated gene-count matrices. This methodological detail has been included in the “Materials and Methods” section of the revised manuscript. Moreover, the RT-qPCR results are presented in Supplementary Figures S7B and S7C.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Quality control (e.g., no. of UMIs, no. of genes, etc.) metrics of the scRNAseq experiments should be presented in the supplementary information for each sample to help support that observed differential expression is not merely an outcome of different sequencing depths of the two samples.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As illustrated in Fig. S5, the quality control data have been supplemented to include the effective cell number of the sample, along with pre- and post-filtering metrics such as nFeature_RNA, nCount_RNA and mitochondrial percentage (percent.mito). Furthermore, scatter plots comparing the basic information of the sample cells before and after filtering are provided.</p>

<p>Line 102: Is there evidence from other animals that LFPPPY can function as a binding site for CD80/CD86? Does CD28 also have this same motif?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The extracellular domains of CTLA-4 and CD28, which bind to CD80/CD86, are largely conserved across various species. This conservation is exemplified by a central PPP core motif, although the flanking amino acids exhibit slight variations. In mammals, both CTLA-4 and CD28 feature the conserved MYPPPY motif. By contrast, in teleost fish, such as rainbow trout, CTLA-4 contains an LYPPPY motif, while CD28 has an MYPPPI motif (Ref. 1). Grass carp CTLA-4 displays an LFPPPY motif, whereas its CD28 variant bears an IYPPPF motif. Yeast two-hybrid assays confirm that these motifs facilitate interactions between grass carp CTLA-4 and CD28 with CD80/CD86 (Ref. 2). Similarly, zebrafish Ctla-4 contains the LFPPPY motif observed in grass carp, while Cd28 exhibits a closely related SYPPPF motif.</p>

<p>Figure 3G displays a protein-protein interaction network constructed from differentially expressed genes. The densely connected nodes, representing physical interactions among proteins, provide valuable insights for basic scientific inquiry and biological or biomedical applications. As proteins are crucial to diverse biological functions, their interactions illuminate the molecular and cellular mechanisms that govern both healthy and diseased states in organisms. Consequently, these networks facilitate the understanding of pathogenic and physiological processes involved in disease onset and progression.</p>
<p>To construct this network, we first utilized the STRING database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://string-db.org">https://string-db.org</ext-link>) to generate an initial network diagram using the differentially expressed genes. This diagram was subsequently imported into Cytoscape (version 3.9.1) for visualization and further analysis. Node size and color intensity reflect the density of interactions, indicating the relative importance of each protein. Figure 3G illustrates that IL1β was a central cytokine hub in the disease process of intestinal inflammation in Ctla-4-deficient zebrafish.</p>

<p>Lines 248-251: This manuscript demonstrates gut inflammation and also changes in microbial diversity, but I don't think it demonstrates an association between them, which would require an experiment that for instance rescues one of these changes and shows that it ameliorates the other change, despite still being a ctla-4 mutant.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the valuable comments from the reviewer. Recently, the relationship between inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and gut microbial diversity has garnered considerable attention, with several key findings emerging from human IBD studies. For instance, patients with IBD (including ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease) exhibit reduced microbial diversity, which is correlated with disease severity. This decrease in microbial richness is thought to stem from the loss of normal anaerobic bacteria, such as <italic>Bacteroides</italic>, <italic>Eubacterium</italic>, and <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> (Refs. 1-6). Research using mouse models has shown that inflammation increases oxygen and nitrate levels within the intestinal lumen, along with elevated host-derived electron acceptors, thereby promoting anaerobic respiration and overgrowth of <italic>Enterobacteriaceae</italic> (Ref 7). Consistent with these findings, our study observed a significant enrichment of <italic>Enterobacteriaceae</italic> in the inflamed intestines of Ctla-4-deficient zebrafish, which supporting the observations in mice. Despite this progress, the zebrafish model for intestinal inflammation remains under development, with limitations in available techniques for manipulating intestinal inflammation and reconstructing gut microbiota. These challenges hinder investigations into the association between intestinal inflammation and changes in microbial diversity. We plan to address these issues through ongoing technological advancements and further research. We thank the reviewer for their understanding.</p>

<p>In this study, we utilized an integrated approach combining bioinformatics prediction, flow cytometry, and co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) to comprehensively investigate and validate the interactions between Cd28/Ctla-4 and Cd80/86. Flow cytometry analysis, as depicted in Supplementary Figure 6D (revised as Supplementary Figure 8F), demonstrated the surface expression of Cd80/86 on HEK293T cells and quantified their interactions with Cd28 and Ctla-4. These experiments not only validated the interactions between Cd80/86 and Cd28/Ctla-4 but also revealed a dose-dependent relationship, providing robust supplementary evidence for the molecular interactions under investigation. Furthermore, in Figure 7F-G, the axis font sizes were enlarged to improve readability. Additionally, in response to reviewers' feedback, we have emphasized Figure 7H, which presents the most compelling evidence for molecular interactions, by including a standalone sentence in the text to enhance its prominence.</p>

<p>The scRNASeq assay is missing some basic characterization: how many WT and mutant fish were assayed in the experiment? how many WT and mutant cells were subject to sequencing? Before going to the immune cell types, are intestinal cell types comparable between the two conditions? Are there specific regions in the tSNE plot in Figure 4A abundant of WT or ctla-4 mutant cells?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In the experiment, we analyzed 30 wild-type and 30 mutant zebrafish for scRNA-seq, with an initial dataset comprising 8,047 cells in the wild-type group and 8,321 cells in the mutant group. Sample preparation details are provided on lines 620-652. Due to the relatively high expression of mitochondrial genes in intestinal tissue, quality control filtering yielded 3,263 cells in the wild-type group and 4,276 cells in the mutant group. Given that the intestinal tissues were dissociated using identical protocols, the resulting cell types are comparable between the two conditions. Both the wild-type and Ctla-4-deficient groups contained enterocytes, enteroendocrine cells, smooth muscle cells, neutrophils, macrophages, B cells, and a cluster of T/NK/ILC-like cells. Notably, no distinct regions were enriched for either condition in the tSNE plot (Figure 4A).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The cell proliferation experiment using PHA stimulation assay demonstrated the role of Ctla-4 in cell proliferation, while the transcriptomic evidence points towards activation rather than an overall expansion of T-cell numbers. This should be discussed towards a more comprehensive model of how subtypes of cells can be differentially proliferating in the disease model.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In the PHA-stimulated T cell proliferation assay, we aimed to investigate the regulatory roles of Ctla-4, Cd28, and Cd80/86 in T cell activation, focusing on validating Ctla-4's inhibitory function as an immune checkpoint. While our study examined general regulatory mechanisms, it did not specifically address the distinct roles of Ctla-4 in different T cell subsets. We appreciate the reviewer's suggestion to develop a more comprehensive model that elucidates differential T cell activation across various subsets in disease models. However, due to the nascent stage of research on fish T cell subsets and limitations in lineage-specific antibodies and transgenic strains, such investigations are currently challenging. We plan to pursue these studies in the future. Despite these constraints, our single-cell RNA sequencing data revealed an increased proportion of Th2 subset cells in Ctla-4-deficient zebrafish, as evidenced by elevated expression levels of Th2 markers (Il4, Il13, and Gata3) via RT-qPCR (see Figures S7B). Notably, recent studies in mouse models have shown that naïve T cells from CTLA-4-deficient mice tend to differentiate into Th2 cells post-proliferation, with activated Th2 cells secreting higher levels of cytokines like IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13, thereby exerting their effector functions (Refs. 1-2). Consequently, our findings align with observations in mice, suggesting conserved CTLA-4 functions across species. We have expanded the &quot;Discussion&quot; section to clarify these points.</p>

These findings align with previous research indicating no significant difference in intestinal health between 3-month-old and 6-month-old wild-type zebrafish (Ref. 1). Consequently, we conclude that there is no notable aging-related change in the intestines of zebrafish aged 4 to 6 months. This reduces the risk associated with age-related variables in our study.

I don't think these indexes are good enough to specifically describe the pathological changes of intestinal villi and mucosa. It is suggested to improve with detailed parameters. As described in the paper entitled &quot;Pathology of Gastric Intestinal Metaplasia: Clinical Implications&quot; published in Am J Gastroenterol., histochemical, normal gastric mucins are pH neutral, and they stain magenta with periodic acid-Schiff (PAS). In an inflamed gut, acid mucins replace the original gastric mucins and are stained blue with Alcian blue (AB). So, to reveal the pathological changes of goblet cells and involved mucin components, AB staining should be added. Also, for the number of goblet cells in the inflammatory intestine, combining PAS and AB staining is the best way to reveal all the goblet cells. In Figure 2, there were very few goblet cells. The infiltration of lymphocytes and the empty intestinal lumen could be observed. Thus, the ratio between the length of intestinal villi and the intestinal ring radius should calculated.</p>
