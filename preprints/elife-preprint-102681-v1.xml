<title>Abstract</title>
<p>We recently discovered increased expression of a long noncoding RNA, lnc-FANCI-2, coinciding with cervical lesion progression from CIN1, CIN2-3 to cervical cancer. Viral E7 of high-risk HPVs and host transcription factor YY1 are two major factors promoting lnc-FANCI-2 expression. To explore possible roles of lnc-FANCI-2 in HPV-induced cervical carcinogenesis, we ablated the expression of <italic>lnc-FANCI-2</italic> in the HPV16-positive cervical cancer cell line, CaSki. Knock-out (KO) single cell clones expressed HPV16 oncogenes normally but displayed altered cell morphology when compared with the parental cells. Proteomic profiling of cytosolic and secreted proteins from the parental and KO cells showed that lnc-FANCI-2 regulates expression of a subset of cell surface and adhesion-related proteins, including inhibition of MCAM, PODXL2 and ECM1 and increased levels of ADAM8 and TIMP2. RNA-seq analyses revealed that, relative to the parental cells, KO cells exhibited significantly increased RAS signaling but decreased IFN pathways. In KO cells, phosphorylated Akt and Erk1/2, two important RAS pathway effectors, were increased more than 3-fold, accompanied by increase of IGFBP3, MCAM, VIM, and CCND2 (cyclin D2) and decrease of RAC3. Accordingly, high levels of lnc-FANCI-2 and lower levels of MCAM in cervical cancer patients are associated with improved survival. We found that lnc-FANCI-2 in CaSki cells interacts specifically with 32 host proteins, including H13, HNRH1, K1H1, MAP4K4, and RNPS1, and knockdown of MAP4K4 led to increase phosphorylation of Akt and Erk1/2. In summary, a key function of lnc-FANCI-2 is to intrinsically regulate RAS signaling, thereby affecting cervical cancer outcome.</p>

<title>Significance</title>
<p>Expression of lnc-FANCI-2 is related to cervical lesion progression. Knock-out (KO) or knock-down (KD) of lnc-FANCI-2 expression in HPV16-positive cervical cancer cells CaSki significantly increases RAS signaling, phosphorylation of Akt and Erk1/2, and increase of epithelial mesenchymal transition factors. lnc-FANCI-2 KO also regulates the expression of a subset of cell surface and adhesion-related proteins IGFBP3 and MCAM. A high level of lnc-FANCI-2 and lower level of MCAM in cervical cancer patients are associated with improved survival. lnc-FANCI-2 in CaSki cells interacts specifically with 32 host proteins, including MAP4K4. KD of MAP4K4 expression in CaSki cells led to increase phosphorylation of Akt and Erk1/2. Thus, one lnc-FANCI-2 function is to intrinsically regulate RAS signaling to impact cervical lesion progression.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Cervical cancer is a leading cause of mortality in women worldwide. It is the second most diagnosed cancer among women, with an estimated 530,000 new cases worldwide each year, and the third most frequent cause of cancer-related death, accounting for 270,000 deaths annually[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>]. Persistent infections in the cervical epithelium with the cancer-associated alpha human papillomaviruses (high-risk HPVs), in particular HPV16 and HPV18 with the sustained expression of viral oncoproteins, E6 and E7, contribute to squamous epithelial cell tumorigenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>]. Approximate 1.4% of high-grade neoplastic cervical lesions progress to invasive cervical cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>], while most lesions resolve spontaneously. The progression to cervical cancer typically takes 15 to 20 years after initial infection (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/cervical-cancer">https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/cervical-cancer</ext-link>). These observations suggest that active host defense systems play important roles in preventing malignant transformation of neoplastic cervical lesions, and additional factors besides E6 and E7 are necessary for cervical cancer development. Indeed, one tumor suppressor network, the Fanconi anemia (FA) pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>], can be activated by HPV-induced DNA damage. FA proteins including FANCA, FANCD2 and FANCI are elevated upon HPV infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>] and the activated FA pathway restricts HPV replication and guards host genome stability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>]. FANCD2 mutation stimulates HPV16 and HPV31 genome amplification and also promotes cervical and vaginal cancer development in HPV16 E7 transgenic mouse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>].</p>
<p>HPV-positive cervical cancer tissues in general exhibits wild-type p53, wild-type K-RAS, and no overexpression of RAS genes[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>]. Viral oncoprotein E7 plays a major role in the immortalization of primary epithelial cells mainly by inactivation of pRb family of proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>], whereas E6 mediates degradation of tumor suppressor p53 and activation of human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>]. However, high-risk E6 and E7 are necessary but not sufficient to transform fully the immortalized cells into malignant cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>] and additional oncogenic stress is needed. For example, the HRAS<sup>G12V</sup>, a constitutively activated RAS GTPase mutation, triggers malignant transformation of E6/E7-expressing keratinocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>]. Normal RAS regulates cell proliferation, cell differentiation and cell adhesion through cellular signal transduction from growth-factor receptors such as insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) and insulin-like growth factor binding proteins (IGFBP1-6) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>]. Thus, overactive RAS signaling might facilitate transformation of E6/E7-expressing keratinocytes. In transgenic mice, HPV16 E6 and E7 can promote the development of spontaneous epithelial skin tumors, but not spontaneous tumors of the reproductive tract [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>]. Prolonged estrogen treatment is required [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>]. Estrogen receptor (ER) activation stimulates the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK/Erk) and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (Pl3K/Akt) pathways, both of which are mediated by RAS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>]. However, the molecular mechanism underlying estrogen-induced cervical cancer in E6 and E7 transgene mice is not fully understood.</p>
<p>Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are RNAs over 200 nucleotides (nt) in length lacking a coding capacity for translation into functional proteins. Although several lncRNAs have been proposed to function in diverse biological processes, evidence is still lacking to support the functionality of the majority of lncRNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>]. Nevertheless, the identified lncRNA functions include regulating: (1) transcription of neighboring or distant genes by recruiting histone modifiers, as shown for Xist [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>] and ANRIL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>], or by causing chromosome looping, as proposed for PVT1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>] and CCAT1-L [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>]; (2) RNA splicing by acting as decoy of splicing factors, as demonstrated for MALAT1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>] and PNCTR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>]; (3) mRNA stability by directly base pairing as antisense transcripts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>], by acting as RNA binding protein (RBP) decoy to prevent mRNA-RBP interaction, such is the case for NORAD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>], or by functioning as miRNA sponges to prevent miRNA-induced degradation of mRNAs, as shown for PTEN [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>] and PNUTS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>]; and (4) protein stability by directly binding, such as MaIL1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>], or by acting as protein decoy to prevent ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation, such as FAST [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>]. Thus, lncRNA genomic position, subcellular localization and their interactions with DNA, RNA and proteins are crucial determinants to the functionality of individual lncRNAs.</p>
<p>We recently reported an increased level of lnc-FANCI-2 expression in high-risk HPV-positive cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) and invasive cervical cancer (ICC) tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>]. At least 14 RNA isoforms of lnc-FANCI-2, which is wrongly annotated by NCBI as a <italic>MIR9-3HG</italic> in the recently updated RefSeq database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/refseq/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/refseq/</ext-link>), are expressed by usage of two alternative promoters , which are ∼10 kb downstream of a non-expressible miR9-3 gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>], alternative RNA splicing, and alternative selection of RNA polyadenylation sites from the genomic locus adjacent to the FANCI on Chr5. Both lnc-FANCI-2 and FANCI are up-regulated simultaneously in neoplastic cervical lesions and cervical cancer by high-risk HPV infections. E6 and, in particular E7 are responsible for the enhanced expression of lnc-FANCI-2, the transcription of which is also regulated by YY1[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>]. HPV infection increases YY1 levels but decreases the expression of p53-dependent miR-29a which targets the YY1 3ʹ UTR. Viral E7 interacts with YY1 and facilitates YY1 transactivation of lnc-FANCI-2 promoter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>]. In situ hybridization has revealed that lnc-FANCI-2 is preferentially cytoplasmic, but its function in HPV infected cells has not been characterized. In this report, we demonstrate that knockout (KO) or knockdown (KD) of lnc-FANCI-2 promotes RAS signaling and phosphorylation of Akt and Erk.</p>

<title>Differential expression of lnc-FANCI-2 in cervical cancer tissues and its derived cell lines</title>
<p>As lnc-FANCI-2 expression is up-regulated along with cervical lesion progression by high-risk HPV infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>], we further verified the increased expression of lnc-FANCI-2 in cervical cancer tissues by RNAscope single molecule RNA in situ hybridization (RNA-ISH) using a lnc-FANCI-2 antisense probe spanning over the major isoform of lnc-FANCI-2 nt 359-1713 region (GenBank MT669800.1). We found both cytoplasmic and nuclear locations of the increased lnc-FANCI-2 ISH signals within the tumor nest in HPV16-infected cervical cancer tissues, but not much so in its adjacent normal tissue areas (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). The increased expression of lnc-FANCI-2 became obvious in human foreskin keratinocytes with HPV16 or HPV18 infection when compared to the HFK cells without HPV infection (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>).</p>

<p>However, we subsequently demonstrated the high expression of lnc-FANCI-2 in four HPV16-infected cervical cancer cell lines (SiHa, CaSki, W12 20861 and W12 20863 cells), but not in two HPV18-infected cervical cancer cell lines (HeLa and C4II cells), nor other HPV-negative cell lines of HCT116 (colorectal cancer cells), BCBL-1 (body cavity B lymphoma cells), HEK293 (Ad5 E1/E2-immortalized human kidney cells), and HaCaT (spontaneously immortalized human epidermal cells) (Fig. S1A). Interestingly, the high expression of lnc-FANCI-2 was observed in a HPV-negative cervical cancer cell line C33A cells with mutations of both p53 and RB genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>] (Fig. S1A). Northern blot confirmed the increased expression of lnc-FANCI-2 in C33A cells and no expression of lnc-FANCI-2 in HeLa cells (Fig. S1B).</p>
<p>Subcellular distribution of lnc-FANCI-2 was characterized by cell fractionation and Western blot assays using nuclear SRSF3 and cytoplasmic GAPDH protein as an indication of fractionation efficiency (Fig. S1C). By RT-qPCR analysis of the fractionated total RNA, we demonstrated that lnc-FANCI-2 RNA is mainly cytoplasmic in HPV16-positive CaSki cells, but nuclear in HPV16-positive SiHa cells (Fig. S1C). The differential subcellular distributions of lnc-FANCI-2 RNA from CaSki to SiHa cells were further confirmed by RNAscope RNA-ISH using the lnc-FANCI-2 antisense probe described above (Fig. S1D).</p>

<title>lnc-FANCI-2 regulates proliferation of HPV-transformed cervical cancer cells</title>
<p>lnc-FANCI-2 RNA is transcribed mainly from a proximal promoter TSS2, but also from an alternative minor, distal promoter TSS1. Two highly conserved YY1 binding motifs upstream of the TSS2 are essential for the TSS2 transcriptional activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>] (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). To elucidate the function of lnc-FANCI-2 in high-risk HPV-infected cervical cancer cells, we knocked out (KO) lnc-FANCI-2 expression in HPV16-positive CaSki cells using CRISPR/Cas9 deletion of either a 3-kb promoter region encompassing both TSS1 and TSS2 or an 86-bp region containing two YY1-binding motifs in the TSS2 promoter (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). Two tested gRNAs with high KO efficiency were selected and cloned into a modified CRISPR/Cas9 expression vector to express both 5ʹ-specific gRNA and 3’-specific gRNA simultaneously for efficient genome editing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>]. CaSki cells stably transfected with the dual gRNA expression vector were generated. Through a serial dilution, several single cell clones were isolated and verified for homozygous deletion by PCR screening. PCR genotyping indicated successful homozygous deletion of the promoter or YY1-binding motifs, respectively (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>).</p>

(D) Northern blot validation of lnc-FANCI-2 KO efficiency from the individual single cell clones or the parental (WT) CaSki cells on polyA<sup>+</sup> RNA (enriched from 100 μg of total cell RNA, lanes 1-4) or 10 μg of total cell RNA (lanes 5-9). Total cell RNA (2 μg) of HEK293T cells with ectopic expression of two isoforms (short, S or long, L) of lnc-FANCI-2 cDNA served as a control. Antisense oligo probe P5 (A) labeled with <sup>32</sup>P was used for hybridization. GAPDH RNA served as a loading control and hybridized with a GAPDH-specific oligo probe.

<p>Loss of lnc-FANCI-2 expression in the single-cell clones was examined by RT-qPCR (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>). When compared to all control clones transfected and selected from an empty vector containing no gRNA, all single cell clones with deletion of YY1-binding motifs (ΔYY1) showed 70-80% reduction of lnc-FANCI-2 expression, whereas the single cell clones with deletion of both TSS1 and TSS2 promoters (ΔPr) showed at least 90% reduction (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>). Northern blot analysis confirmed the decrease in levels of the two major lnc-FANCI-2 isoforms (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>), with an abundant 4-kb lnc-FANCI-2 RNA derived from a distal polyadenylation site pA2 and a less abundant 2-kb of lnc-FANCI-2 RNA derived from a proximal polyadenylation site pA1[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>] (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2D</xref>). Reduced lnc-FANCI-2 RNA expression was also confirmed by RNAscope RNA-ISH (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2F</xref>). The parental (WT) CaSki cells expressed ∼10 copies of lnc-FANCI-2 RNA per cell [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>], whereas the copy number of lnc-FANCI-2 RNA in the ΔYY1-D5 cells dropped to ∼5 copies and to ∼2 copies per cell in the ΔPr-A9 cells (each averaged from 200 cells).</p>
<p>Although the WT CaSki cells grow as cell islands, the lnc-FANCI-2 KO cells displayed a dispersed cell growth pattern and an irregular or spindle-like cell morphology which was more obvious in the ΔPr-A9 cells (Fig. S2A). The ΔPr-A9 cells were further examined for effects on HPV16 E6 and E7 expression. When compared with WT CaSki cells, the ΔPr-A9 cells showed little change in E6, E7, p53 (E6 downstream target) and E2F1 (E7 downstream target) protein levels (Fig. S2B).</p>

<title>lnc-FANCI-2 regulates the expression and secretion of cell soluble receptors</title>
<p>We considered that altered expression of cell membrane proteins and secreted factors in the lnc-FANCI-2 KO cells might contribute to the observed different cell morphology and growth properties.

<p>Using 30% cut-off (FC -/+0.3), we identified from the ΔPr-A9 cell lysate nine proteins with increased expression compared to the WT CaSki cells, including PODXL2, ECM1, NECTIN2, MCAM, ADAM9, ADAM10, CDH5, ITGA5 and NOTCH1, and six proteins with decreased expression including ITGB6, CDH13, LGALS3BP, TIMP2, ADMA8 and SCARF2 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3B</xref>).

<p>Hierarchical clustering analysis showed more global transcriptional similarity between ΔYY1-D5 and ΔPr-A9 cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>). By applying a threshold of fold change (FC) ≥ 1.8 or FC ≤ -1.8 with FDR ≤ 0.01, we found 1230 genes in ΔPr-A9 and 797 genes in ΔYY1-D5 cells with significantly differential expression relative to the WT CaSki cells expressing ∼15890 genes. The most significantly affected genes are shown in Volcano plots (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref> and Table S1). Among these, 211 were upregulated and 189 were downregulated in both ΔPr-A9 and Δ YY1-D5 cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref> and Table S2).

The results displayed in the heatmap of <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E</xref> included 52 upregulated, and 47 downregulated genes excluding lnc-FANCI-2.

<title>lnc-FANCI-2 regulates RAS GTPase activities to phosphorylate RAS signaling effectors Akt and Erk</title>
<p>RAS activation triggers two major downstream signal transduction pathways, Raf/Mek/Erk and PI3K/Akt (Fig. S4), to transduce signals from extracellular stimuli to the cell nucleus where specific effector genes are activated for their corresponding functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>]. To further confirm the GSEA data and verify that two major signaling pathways of RAS are activated, we first examined and compared the RAS GTPase activities in ΔPr-A9 cells and the WT CaSki cells. We found a significant increase in RAS GTPase activity in ΔPr-A9 cells (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>, top bar graphs), indicating that the endogenous lnc-FANCI-2 RNA in CaSki cells suppresses not only the expression of IGFBP3 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4F</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4G</xref>), the most abundant IGFBP, but also RAS activation (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>, top bar graphs). Since ΔPr-A9 cells had undergone long term selection and adaption during single cell screening, the increased RAS GTPase activity might result from selection pressure for cell survival. However, by transient siRNA knockdown (KD) of lnc-FANCI-2 expression in the WT CaSki cells, we obtained a similar, albeit weaker, increase of RAS GTPase activity (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>, lower bar graphs). This result suggests that the increased RAS GTPase activity in ΔPr-A9 cells was unrelated to the persistent selection pressure, but rather the deficiency of lnc-FANCI-2.</p>

We observed a 3-fold increase in phosphorylated Akt (p-Akt) and 2.5-fold increase of p-Erk1/2 (p44/p42 MAPK), after being normalized to total Akt and Erk levels, in ΔPr-A9 cells over the WT CaSki cells (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref>). These results were confirmed in ΔYY1-D5 cells (Fig. S5A). The increased p-Akt and p-Erk (mostly p-Erk2/p42) was accompanied by elevated expression of MCAM, VIM, and CCND2, and decreased expression of RAC3 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref>). These randomly chosen potential RAS effector proteins facilitate membrane receptor function, cell proliferation, and EMT. Moreover, transient siRNA knockdown of lnc-FANCI-2 in the WT CaSki cells also led to the increased levels of p-Akt and p-Erk (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C</xref>) and increased expression of MCAM and VIM at 48 h and 96 h post-transfection (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C</xref>). These observations indicate that a transient loss of lnc-FANCI-2 in CaSki cells is sufficient to trigger RAS signaling. The same siRNA transfection in HeLa cells, a lnc-FANCI-2 negative cell line (Fig. S1A and S1B), exhibited no effect on p-Akt or p-Erk1/2 levels (Fig. S5B), but in SiHa cells containing mainly nuclear lnc-FANCI-2 (Fig. S1C and S1D) enhanced the expression of p-Akt and p-Erk1/2 (Fig. S5B), verifying the specific effect of lnc-FANCI-2 depletion on RAS signaling pathways independently of cellular distribution of predominant lnc-FANCI-2. The lnc-FANCI-2 KO-mediated increase in p-Akt and p-Erk was sensitive to PI3K inhibitor LY294002 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>] (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6D</xref>, lanes 4-6) and MEK1/2 inhibitor U0126 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref>] (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6D</xref>, lanes 7-9), respectively.

<p>As shown in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E</xref> and Fig. S6A, the increased RNA expression of MCAM (CD146 or MUC18) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref>] appears to be transcriptional or posttranscriptional in both ΔPr-A9 and ΔYY1-D5 cells. We confirmed by RT-PCR the lnc-FANCI-2 KO-mediated increase of MCAM RNA expression in ΔPr-A9 cells (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7C</xref>). A rescue experiment was further performed by transient expression of one major isoform of lnc-FANCI-2 RNA (a-PA2, GenBank: MT669800.1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>] in ΔPr-A9 cells to determine both nuclear and cytoplasmic MCAM expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref>] in individual lnc-FANCI-2 expressing cells. ΔPr-A9 cells ectopically expressing diffused cytoplasmic lnc-FANCI-2 RNA, as detected by RNAscope RNA-ISH, exhibited a marked reduction in nuclear MCAM protein (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7D</xref>-<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7E</xref>). Quantitative analyses of the ΔPr-A9 cells with or without transient lnc-FANCI-2 RNA expression showed significant reduction of nuclear MCAM protein in the 35 cells with rescued lnc-FANCI-2 expression when compared to the 54 cells expressing no lnc-FANCI-2 (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7F</xref>). Due to RNAscope procedures, the membrane-bound and cytoplasmic MCAM protein was mostly removed by protease III treatment when RNA-ISH was performed and thus only the nuclear signal of MCAM protein remained was detectable by IF staining. Using cell fractionation, we detected a cleaved MCAM of ∼46 kDa mainly in the nuclear fraction by Western blot (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7G</xref>). The increased nuclear MCAM expression in ΔPr-A9 cells was proportional to the cytoplasmic and total MCAM levels when compared with the WT CaSki cells (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7G</xref>). The nuclear MCAM signal appeared as a proteolytic cleavage product presumably by the increased metalloprotease ADAM9 and ADAM10 proteins and decreased metalloprotease inhibitor TIMP2 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>), as observed in other studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref>].</p>
<p>The significance of the inverse correlation of lnc-FANCI-2 and MCAM in CaSki cells was further investigated by analyzing their expression in 304 cervical cancer samples from the TCGA dataset. There was a significant negative correlation in lnc-FANCI-2 (LINC00925 being wrongly assigned by NCBI)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>] and MCAM RNA levels (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7H</xref>). The opposite effects of lnc-FANCI-2 and MCAM on cervical cancer survival (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7I</xref> and Fig. S7) show that the cervical cancer patients with a higher level of lnc-FANCI-2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>] but a lower level of MCAM in the cervical tissue (Fig. S7 and <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7I</xref>) exhibited a better survival prognosis.</p>

<title>Regulatory roles of lnc-FANCI-2-mediated increase of MCAM and IGFBP3 on RAS signaling</title>
<p>To further dissect the lnc-FANCI-2-associated expression of MCAM and IGFBP3 on RAS signaling, we examined MCAM and IGFBP3 on phosphorylation of PI3K/Akt and Erk1/Erk2 in CaSki cells in the presence or absence of lnc-FANCI-2. As shown in <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7J</xref>, we found, although KD or KO of lnc-FANCI-2 promotes phosphorylation of Akt and Erk (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7J</xref>, lane 2), that KD of MCAM expression in WT parental CaSki cells in the absence of lnc-FANCI-2 (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7J</xref>, lane 3) or ΔPr-A9 cells (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>, lane 5) led to reduction of Akt and Erk phosphorylation. Data suggest that MCAM is a lnc-FANCI-2 effector, but also could be a trigger of signal transduction as reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref>].</p>
<p>IGFBP3 protein has been viewed as a RAS signaling regulator [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>], but recent studies show that IGFBP3 has a variety of intracellular ligands involved in many unexpected functions[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref>]. Thus, KD or KO of lnc-FANCI-2-mediated IGFBP3 expression on RAS signaling in WT parental CaSki cells or ΔPr-A9 cells was examined by Western blot after siRNA KD of IGFBP3 expression. As shown in <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7K</xref>, KD of IGFBP3 expression was found to increase phosphorylation of Erk1/2 by ∼70% (lane 4) to ∼60% (lane 6), but not much so for Akt phosphorylation (lanes 4 and 6). Instead, KD of IGFBP3 expression could prevent KD of lnc-FANCI-2 to enhance Akt phosphorylation in WT parental CaSki cells (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7K</xref>, compare lane 2 and lane 3).

<title>MAP4K4 association with lnc-FANCI-2 RNA in CaSki cells regulates RAS signaling and phosphorylation of Akt and Erk</title>
<p>We speculated lnc-FANCI-2 restriction on RAS signaling through interactions with cellular proteins. Subsequently, comprehensive identification of lnc-FANCI-2-binding proteins in the WT CaSki cells was performed by an IRPCRP protocol (modified from published ChIRP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref>]) in combination with mass spectrometry (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8A</xref>). In this protocol, the lnc-FANCI-2-binding proteins in the WT CaSki cells were covalently crosslinked to lnc-FANCI-2 RNA via UV irradiation and pulled down by pooled 30 antisense oligos crossing over the entire lnc-FANCI-2. The RNA extracted from the pulldowns were verified to be lnc-FANCI-2 specific by RT-PCR in the absence (-) or presence (+) of reverse transcriptase (RT) (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8B</xref>). The lnc-FANCI-2-binding proteins in the pulldowns were then subjected to LC-MS/MS analyses. We identified 32 specific lnc-FANCI-2-binding proteins, including H13, HNRH1, K1H1, MAP4K4, and RNPS1 (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8C</xref>, Table S4).</p>

(B) lnc-FANCI-2 RNA in the IRPCRP-1 and IRPCRP-2 pulldowns had the pooled antisense biotinylated oligos (pool 1 with oligos in even numbers and pool 2 with oligos in odd numbers) immobilized to avidin-beads first before mixed with cell lysates, while the IRPCRP-3 and IRPCRP-4 pulldowns had the oligos pool 1 and 2 separately mixed with cell lysates first before addition to the avidin-beads for the RNA pull-downs. RT-PCR in the absence (-) or presence (+) of reverse transcriptase (RT) was carried out using the RNA isolated from the individual IRPCRP experiments using a primer pair of oHBL5 and oHBL12 (Table S5) specific for lnc-FANCI-2 RNA detection. Beads only (no oligos) IRPCRP experiments served as a negative control. Total RNA from the WT CaSki cells after sonication was used as an input control. Arrow indicates the detected lnc-FANCI-2 RNA. (C) Proteins associated with lnc-FANCI-2 RNA identified from lnc-FANCI-2 IRPCRP pulldowns. A total of 32 proteins were specifically pulled down from lnc-FANCI-2 IRPCRP reactions 1-4 (PSM≥2 from two separate pulldowns, Table S4), with top 10 proteins binding lnc-FANCI-2 shown in the order by the number of identified PSM. (D) Expression of p-Akt and p-Erk from CaSki WT cells 48 h after siRNA-mediated KD of MAP4K4 or lnc-FANCI-2 was immunoblotted by the corresponding antibodies. GAPDH served as a sample loading control. Fold change of the indicated proteins in the cells with KD of MAP4K4 or lnc-FANCI-2 over the cells treated by a non-targeting siRNA (siNS) was calculated after normalizing to GAPDH. (E) A proposed model illustrates how lnc-FANCI-2-protein complexes inhibits the RAS signaling pathway to control Akt/ErK phosphorylation and expression of host genes. In the absence of lnc-FANCI-2 in CaSki cells, RAS signaling can be triggered by extracellular stimuli, such as IGFBP3, MCAM ligands, etc. As a result, phosphorylation of AKT and Erk leads to cascaded responses of transcription factors (TFs) to regulate the expression of RAS signaling responder genes, such as IGFBP3, MCAM, etc.</p></caption>

Thus, whether MAP4K4 in association with lnc-FANCI-2 could regulate PI3K/Akt signal transduction was investigated in the WT CaSki cells. We demonstrated that siRNA knockdown of MAP4K4 expression in the WT CaSki cells, as seen for KD of lnc-FANCI-2, led to ∼40% or more increase of phosphorylation of both Akt and Erk1/2 (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8D</xref>, compare lane 2 to lane 3). The data suggest that, through RNA-protein interactions, the increased lnc-FANCI-2 RNA in cells and their association with MAP4K4 and other cellular proteins could be one arm to control RAS signaling and gene expression of its effectors (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8E</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>HPV oncoproteins E6 and E7 are necessary but not sufficient for development of cervical cancer. Indeed, early studies indicated that other oncogenic stress, such as activated RAS mutant, is needed to trigger malignant transformation of E6 and E7 expressing cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">76</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">77</xref>] and tumorigenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">78</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">82</xref>]. Moreover, E7 has been also reported to repress phosphorylation of Akt and Akt mediated signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">83</xref>]. In this study, we show that lnc-FANCI-2, whose expression is highly dependent on E7 and YY1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>], intrinsically restricts RAS GTPase activities and Akt and Erk phosphorylation presumably by interacting with cellular factors, in HPV16-positive CaSki cells. Interestingly, early reports indicated that p-Akt attenuation by E7 could be abolished by introduction of H73E mutation in the E7 CR3 domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">83</xref>]. This E7 CR3 domain is also essential to interact with transcription factor YY1 to activate lnc-FANCI-2 transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>]. Thus, it would be presumable that the reported p-Akt attenuation by E7 might be mediated by the increased expression of lnc-FANCI-2. More importantly, these findings also suggest that additional oncogenic stress, such as activated RAS mutant, is required to overcome the lnc-FANCI-2 restriction on RAS signaling for the early observed malignant transformation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">76</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">77</xref>] and tumorigenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">78</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">82</xref>] of E6 and E7 expressing cells. In CaSki cells, loss of lnc-FANCI-2 in this report was found to promote RAS signaling but reduction of IFN responses.</p>
<p>Some lncRNAs function as RAS regulators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">84</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">85</xref>] by their ability to sequester RAS-targeting miRNAs, including MALAT1/ miR-217, RMRP/miR-206, and KRAS1P/miR-143/let-7 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">85</xref>]. Conceivably, lncRNAs may also regulate RAS signaling through other mechanisms beyond miRNAs. In this report, loss of lnc-FANCI-2 in HPV16-positive CaSki and SiHa cells promotes RAS signaling and expression of RAS signaling effectors (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8E</xref>). By profiling the proteins associated with lnc-FANCI-2 in CaSki cells, we identified MAP4K4, a serine/threonine protein kinase and a negative RAS signaling regulator in the context of the early embryo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">74</xref>] and lymphatic vascular development by interacting with RASA1[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">75</xref>] as one of major lnc-FANCI-2-binding proteins that may partially mediate the lnc-FANCI-2 restriction on RAS signaling. Indeed, silencing of MAP4K4 in CaSki cells led to increase of both p-Akt and p-Erk1/2 as reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">74</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">75</xref>]. Thus, our data suggest that MAP4K4 protein functions coordinately with lnc-FANCI-2 RNA in the CaSki cells to restrict RAS signaling.</p>
<p>Although all HPV16-positive cervical cancer and pre-cancer cell lines examined, such as CaSki, SiHa, W12 subclone cells 20861(HPV16<sup>+</sup>, integrated) and 20863 (HPV16<sup>+</sup>, episomal), produce predominantly cytoplasmic or nuclear lnc-FANCI-2, unexpectedly, we found not all cervical cancer cell lines, including HPV18-positive HeLa and C4II cells, express lnc-FANCI-2, nor colorectal cancer cell line HCT116, adenovirus 5 DNA-transformed human embryonic kidney cell line HEK293, spontaneously transformed aneuploid immortal keratinocyte cell line HaCaT, and KSHV-infected B cell lymphoma cell line BCBL-1 cells which are all HPV-negative cell lines. It remains to know what negatively regulates lnc-FANCI-2 expression in those cell lines and more HPV18-positive cell lines should be examined for lnc-FANCI-2 expression. However, we did find that a HPV-negative cervical cancer cell line, C33A cells expressing mutant p53 and mutant pRB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>], produce a high level of lnc-FANCI-2 (Fig. S1A and S1B). In the lnc-FANCI-2 producing cells, we noticed that cellular location of lnc-FANCI-2 also varies from cell types, with lnc-FANCI-2 predominantly in the nucleus in SiHa cells, but in the cytoplasm in CaSki cells, although both contribute to regulate RAS signaling. This suggests that a variety of nuclear and cytoplasmic functions of lnc-FANCI-2 remains to be explored.</p>
<p>IGFBP3 is a major IGF carrier and enhances both IGF-and EGF-RAS signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">86</xref>] to activate phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT and the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/ERK pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">87</xref>]. Surprisingly, we find a suppressive role of IGFBP3 on Erk phosphorylation, but not on Akt, in the presence or absence of lnc-FANCI-2 in HPV16-positive CaSki cells. Although ∼99% of circulating IGF-1 is bound to IGFBPs, predominantly to IGFBP-3, which is the most abundant IGFBP in human serum, case-control studies showed significantly lower IGF-1 and IGFBP-3 serum levels in patients with invasive cervical cancer over the control group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">88</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">89</xref>]. A reduced expression of IGFBP-3 mRNA level appears to be associated with progression to cervical cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref>]. Consistently with lnc-FANCI-2’s suppressive effect on IGFBP3 expression in our study, an increased level of lnc-FANCI-2 expression is associated step-wisely with high-risk HPV-positive cervical intraepithelial neoplasia and invasive cervical cancer tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>].</p>
<p>It is obvious from our RNA-seq and human soluble receptor array analysis that KO of lnc-FANCI-2 in CaSki cells affects the expression of a large set of genes responsible for RAS signaling, EMT pathway, and IFN responses. In addition to the notified activation of PI3K/Akt and Raf/Mek/Erk pathways, one of the major RAS signaling effectors in lnc-FANCI-2 KO or KD cells was MCAM. MCAM binds various cellular surface receptors or co-receptors to trigger signal transduction, cell proliferation and motility, tumor angiogenesis, and tumor cell metastasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref>]. It is an integral, highly glycosylated membrane protein with three common protein isoforms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">90</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">91</xref>]. Two membrane-anchored forms with a long (p113) or short (p76) cytoplasmic tail produced by alternative RNA splicing and a proteolytically cleaved soluble form without transmembrane and cytoplasmic regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">91</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c92">92</xref>]. In addition to its roles in cell signal transduction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">90</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">91</xref>], the short isoform produced by an intramembrane cleavage may be directed towards the nucleus to regulate gene transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref>]. We found that CaSki cells express mainly a cytoplasmic form of full-length MCAM (∼113 kDa) and a small nuclear form (∼46 kDa), but not the short ∼78 kDa isoform nor the soluble product. Moreover, lnc-FANCI-2 KO cells exhibit high MCAM levels, which was most likely a result of the increased RAS signaling. Consistently, lnc-FANCI-2 and MCAM levels are negatively correlated in cervical cancer patients, and low levels of MCAM and high levels of lnc-FANCI-2 indicate better prognosis. This suggests that increased MCAM might promote cervical tumorigenesis in vivo. Given that the cells with Inc-FANCI-2 KO exhibit increased levels of IGFBP3 and MCAM and the ΔPr-A9 cells with rescued lnc-FANCI-2 RNA expression displayed remarkable reduction of IGFBP3 and MCAM expression, our current model (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8E</xref>) highlights how the HPV16-enhanced expression of lnc-FANCI-2 in cervical cancer cells might function as a negative regulator by binding to various RNA-binding proteins to block RAS signaling and reduce the expression of RAS signaling effectors such as IGFBP3 and MCAM, etc.</p>
<p>In conclusion, this study provides the first evidence that one of lnc-FANCI-2 functions is to maintain epithelial functional integrity by repressing RAS signaling in preventing malignant transformation of neoplastic cervical lesions. In addition, more extensive studies are undergoing to elucidate the role of lnc-FANCI-2 in regulation of IFN responses, which are not covered in this report. Since transactivation of lnc-FANCI-2 expression is largely dependent on host transcription factor YY1 of which expression is regulated by HPV oncoproteins and host miR-29a, dissecting their transcription network on lnc-FANCI-2 and its effectors may further provide novel insights involved in host homeostasis against HPV infection-induced carcinogenesis. Our observations also highlight additional, unexpected players beyond viral E6 and E7 that drive cells toward malignant transformation.</p>

<p>Two gRNAs each under control by a U6 promoter in a pSpCas9(BB)-2A-Puro vector were used to create deletion in CaSki cells. Plasmid pHBL25 which contains gRNA 1 and 6 was used to delete the entire promoter region of lnc-FANCI-2 and plasmid pHBL27 which contains gRNA 3 and 4 was used to delete only two YY1-binding motifs spanning over an 87-bp region in the lnc-FANCI-2 promoter. CaSki cells transfected with the gRNA-expressing vectors were then under 2 weeks of puromycin selection (0.1 µg/ml). The puromycin-resistant CaSki cells were diluted to a final concentration of 0.5 cells per 100 μl, plated 100 μl of diluted cells into each well of a 96-well plate, and grew under continuous purymycin selection.

<p>A direct PCR was performed for number of single cell clones as described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>]. Briefly, several hundreds of cells expanded from a single cell clone were resuspended in 50 μl of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and then frozen-thawed on dry ice for three times. Cell lysates were treated with 4 μl of Qiagen protease (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany, #1017782,) at 56°C for 10 min, and the protease was inactivated at 95°C for 5 mins. The resulting product was directly used for PCR screening. P1 + P5 were used for verification of promoter deletion and P3 + P4 for YY1 motifs deletion. To ensure the selected single cell clones displaying homozygous knockout of lnc-FANCI-2, total cell DNA was isolated using a QIAamp DNA Blood Minikit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany, #51106) and then the homozygous deletion was screened and the cells with homozygous KO were selected and confirmed by PCR. The primers used for genotyping are listed in supplementary Table S5. At least two single cell clones either with lnc-FANCI-2 promoter deletion or with YY1 motif deletion were selected.

<title>Northern blot</title>
<p>To validate lnc-FANCI-2 KO in CaSki cells, Northern blot was performed using polyA<sup>+</sup> mRNA isolated from 100 µg of total CaSki RNA with PolyATtract mRNA Isolation Systems (Promega, #Z5310) or 10 µg of total CaSki total RNA as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>]. Briefly, RNA samples were denatured in NorthernMax Formaldehyde loading dye (Thermo Fisher Scientific, #AM8552) at 75°C for 15 min, then separated in an 1% formaldehyde-containing agarose gel and transferred onto a GeneScreen Plus hybridization transfer membrane (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA, #NEF987001PK). RNAs on the membrane were crosslinked by exposing to UV light, and then prehybridized with PerfectHyb Plus hybridization buffer (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, #H7003) for 2 h at 42°C. Specific oligos against lnc-FANCI-2 or GAPDH listed in Table S5 were labeled with [γ-<sup>32</sup>P]-ATP using T4 PNK (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, #18004–010) and added into hybridization buffer for overnight incubation at 42°C. The membrane was then washed with 2× SSPE/0.5% SDS solution for 5 mins, followed by twice washes with 0.5× SSPE/0.5% SDS each for 15 min at 42°C and then exposed to a PhosphorImager screen.</p>

<title>RNA-seq and data analysis</title>
<p>Total RNA was from WT CaSki cells, ΔYY1-D5 and ΔPr-A9 cells were extracted using TRIzol reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, #15596018). Total ribo-minus RNA-seq libraries, four samples in each group, were prepared with TruSeq Stranded Total RNA Library Kit and then subjected to pair-end sequencing using Illumina-HiSeq3000/4000 platform.</p>
<p>The obtained reads were processed using the CCBR Pipeliner utility (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/CCBR/Pipeliner">https://github.com/CCBR/Pipeliner</ext-link>). Briefly, reads were trimmed from adapters and low-quality bases using Cutadapt (version 1.18) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://bioweb.pasteur.fr/packages/pack@cutadapt@1.18">https://bioweb.pasteur.fr/packages/pack@cutadapt@1.18</ext-link>) before alignment to the custom reference genome described below. The transcripts were aligned using STAR v2.5.2b in two-pass mode [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c94">94</xref>]. Expression levels were quantified using RSEM (version 1.3.0) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c95">95</xref>] with a custom gene annotation described below.</p>
<p>The custom reference genome allowing quantification of both HPV16 and host expression used in this alignment consisted of the human reference genome (hg38/Dec. 2013/GRCh38) with a HPV16 FASTA (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pave.niaid.nih.gov/">https://pave.niaid.nih.gov/</ext-link>) sequence added as an additional pseudochromosome. The custom gene annotation used for gene expression quantification consisted of a concatenation of the hg38 GENCODE annotation version 30 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c96">96</xref>] and the HPV16 genome, with one other notable alteration. The hg38 v30 gene annotation is incorrect at the location of the lnc-FANCI-2 locus in the hg38 genome at chr15:89378104-89398487, which affects quantification of this gene. To correct this annotation and provide accurate quantification, therefore, we first performed BLAST against hg38 using the sequences of the 14 known isoform transcripts of lnc-FANCI-2 (MT669800 for lnc-FANCI-2a-PA2, MT669801 for lnc-FANCI-2a-PA1, MT669802 for lnc-FANCI-2b-PA2, MT669803 for lnc-FANCI-2b-PA1, MT669804 for lnc-FANCI-2c-PA2, MT669805 for lnc-FANCI-2c-PA1, MT669806 for lnc-FANCI-2d-PA2, MT669807 for lnc-FANCI-2d-PA1, MT669808 for lnc-FANCI-2e-PA2, MT669809 for lnc-FANCI-2e-PA1, MT669810 for lnc-FANCI-2f-PA2, MT669811 for lnc-FANCI-2f-PA1, MT669812 for lnc-FANCI-2g-PA2, and MT669813 for lnc-FANCI-2g-PA1). The results were used to determine the precise exon start and stop sites for each of the isoforms. These were then used to manually adjust the default hg38 v30 gene annotations at the locus indicated above to account for the correct structure of the lnc-FANCI-2 locus and its 14 isoforms.</p>
<p>Downstream analysis and visualization were performed within the NIH Integrated Analysis Portal (NIDAP) using R programs developed on the Foundry platform (Palantir Technologies). Briefly, raw counts data produced by RSEM were imported into the NIDAP platform, genes were filtered for low counts (&lt;1 cpm) and the voom algorithm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c97">97</xref>] from the Limma R package (version 3.40.6) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c98">98</xref>] was used for quantile normalization and calculation of differentially expressed genes. Pre-ranked GSEA was performed using the Molecular Signatures Database version 6.2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c99">99</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c100">100</xref>] and the fgsea package [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c101">101</xref>]. Raw data and the analyzed RNA-seq data supporting the findings in this study have been deposited in the NCBI GEO database (the accession#: GSE190904).</p>

<title>Human Soluble Receptor Array</title>
<p>To detect the changes of soluble receptors expressed and released from parental WT CaSki cells and lnc-FANCI-2 KO cells, Proteome Profiler Human sReceptor (Soluble Receptor) Array (R&amp;D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, # ARY012) was performed according to a manufacturer protocol. Briefly, 7 × 10<sup>6</sup> WT CaSki cells and ΔPr-A9 cells were cultured in 15 ml of DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS in a T75 flask for 24 h. Cell culture supernatants were then collected and centrifuged at 4,000 × g for 15 min to remove cell debris. Cells were rinsed by 10 ml of PBS and solubilized in Lysis Buffer 17 at 4°C for 30 min. The cell lysis was then centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 5 min to remove cell debris. Protein concentration of cell lysis was measured by Micro BCA Protein Assay (PIERCE, Waltham, MA, #23235). Next, two sets of N and C membranes were blocking by Buffer 8/1 in 4-Well Multi-dish for 1 h on a rocking platform. 500 μl of culture supernatant or 100 μg cell lysate generated from the WT CaSki cells or ΔPr-A9 cells were diluted in 3 ml of Buffer 8/1, and then applied to each membrane after three washes with 1× Wash Buffer. The membranes were incubated overnight at 4 °C on a rocking platform and washed three times to remove unbound materials followed by incubation with their specific cocktail of biotinylated detection antibodies for 2 h at room temperature on a rocking platform. 2 ml of diluted Streptavidin-HRP was then applied to each membrane for 30 min at room temperature on a rocking platform after three times of wash. 1 ml of the prepared Chemi Reagent Mix was added onto the membranes after three times of wash. The signal was then captured by ChemiDoc Touch Imaging System (Bio-Rad). Quantification of the relative protein expression in ΔPr-A9 cells compared to the WT cells was determined in Image Lab software (Bio-Rad). The average signal of duplicate spots subtracting background value from negative control spots represented the levels of each protein. The relative change in protein levels was then determined by comparing ΔPr-A9 cells to the WT cells.</p>

<title>RNA <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization (RNA-ISH)</title>
<p>Endogenous lnc-FANCI-2 in CaSki cells was examined by RNAScope Multiplex Fluorescent V2 Assay (Advanced Cell Diagnostics, Minneapolis, MN, #323100) as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>]. A custom-designed probe targeting to nt 359-1713 of GenBank Acc. No. MT669800.1 transcript for lnc-FANCI-2a-PA2 was utilized. Dual staining of lnc-FANCI-2 and IGFBP RNA was performed according to RNAscope Multplex Fluorescent v2 Manual part 2 (#323100), and the channel one probe for IGFBP3 (#310351) and channel three probe for lnc-FANCI-2 (#509061-C3) were applied.</p>
<p>For RNA-ISH combined IF staining of MCAM protein, 3 × 10<sup>5</sup> of CaSki cells were grown on a glass coverslip in a 6-well plate for 24 h before transfection. Plasmid pHBL05 containing a long isoform of lnc-FANCI-2a-PA2 (GenBank Acc. No. MT669800.1) were transfected into cells with LipoD 293 DNA in vitro transfection reagent. Cultured Adherent Cell Sample Preparation for the RNAscope Multplex Fluorescent v2 was performed according to a manufacturer protocol (Advanced Cell Diagnostics, Minneapolis, MN, MK-50-010). Briefly, the cells were washed with PBS and fixed by 10% neutral buffered formalin at room temperature for 30 min. The cells were washed with PBS three times and dehydrated by 50% ethanol for 5 min, 70% ethanol for 5 min, 100% ethanol for 5 min, and 100% ethanol for 10 min. The cells were then rehydrated by 70% ethanol for 2 min, 50% ethanol for 2 min, and PBS for 10 min. The cells were then applied to hydrogen peroxide at RT for 10 min and washed with distilled water for three times. The cells were then applied to Protease III (1:15 dilution with PBS) at RT for 10 min. The cells were ready for RNAscope Multplex Fluorescent v2 Manual part 2 (#323100). IF was performed after RNA-ISH but before counterstaining with DAPI. The cells were washed with PBS, and then were blocked with 2% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS for 1 h at 37°C or overnight at 4°C. The cells were incubated with the MCAM primary antibody (ProteinTech, Rosemont, IL, #17564-1-AP, diluted 1:200 in 2% BSA blocking buffer) for 2 h at 37°C. An Alexa Fluor-conjugated secondary antibody (1: 500, ThermoFisher Scientific) was diluted in a blocking solution and incubated for 1 h at 37°C. The slides were washed with PBS for three times. DAPI was used for nuclei counterstaining before mounting in a Prolong Gold Antifade mounting medium (Thermo Fisher Scientific, #P36934).</p>
<p>Confocal images were collected using a Zeiss LSM710 laser-scanning microscope equipped with a 63 × Plan-Apochromat (N.A. 1.4) objective lens. Three dimensional distributions of lnc-FANCI-2 were generated by Z stacks using ZEN 2.3 software (Zeiss).</p>

<p>To identify the lnc-FANCI-2 RNA-associated proteins, we pulled down lnc-FANCI-2 RNA from WT CaSki cells using IRPCRP, a modified ChIRP protocol from the published method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c102">102</xref>], followed by mass spectrometry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref>]. Briefly, a total of 30 lnc-FANCI-2 anti-sense oligo probes (oLLY496-oLLY525), each with biotinTEG at 3’ end, across entire lnc-FANCI-2 RNA (GenBank Acc. No MT669800.1) were designed using the online probe designer (singlemoleculefish.com). Two probe pools were used in IRPCRP assays: the probe pool 1 was the mixed oligos in even numbers (oLLY496/498/500/502/504/506/508/510/512/514/516/518/520/522/524) and the probe pool 2 mixed with the oligos in odd numbers (oLLY497/499/501/503/505/507/509/511/513/515/517/519/521/523/525) (Table S5). CaSki cells were seeded and harvested at 24 h and the cell lysates from 200 million cells were used for each IRPCRP reaction. Instead of formaldehyde crosslink in the standard protocol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c102">102</xref>], UV cross-linking (254 nm, energy at 480 mJ/cm<sup>2</sup>) was applied in our study to minimize non-specific binding. After UV cross-linking, the cells were lysed on ice in 1× radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer (Boston Bioproducts, Ashland, MA, #BP-115) (50 mM Tris base/Tris-HCl [pH 7.4], 150 mM NaCl, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate [SDS], 1% NP-40) supplemented with protease inhibitors (complete mini-EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail, Millipore Sigma, Burlington, MA, #469315900) and RNase inhibitor (Thermo Fisher Scientific, #AM2694) for 30 min, followed by a brief sonication. The obtained cell lysates were spin for 10 min of centrifugation at 20,000 × g at 4°C and the collected cell lysate supernatants were pre-absorbed with C-1 magnetic beads (Thermo Fisher Scientific, #65002) for 1 h at room temperature before proceeding to oligo probe hybridization.</p>
<p>Two different hybridization protocols were used to pull down lnc-FANCI-2 RNA. One had the pre-absorbed cell lysate incubated with two separate probe pools in hybridization buffer (750 mM NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 50 mM Tris-Cl pH 7.0, 1 mM EDTA, 15% formamide) at room temperature overnight and the pre-washed C-1 magnetic beads was then added and incubated for additional 4 h; the other had two separate oligo probe pools immobilized onto pre-washed C-1 magnetic beads first at room temperature for 1 h and then mixed with the pre-absorbed cell lysates in hybridization buffer overnight at room temperature, along with the negative control-beads only IRPCRP reaction without oligo probes serving as a control in the modified protocol. After hybridization, the beads were washed with 1× wash buffer (2× NaCl and sodium citrate, 0.1% SDS) for 5 times and resuspend in 1 ml lysis buffer. 100 µl beads from each IRPCRP were set aside for RNA isolation of lnc-FANCI-2 pulldown efficiency and the leftover beads were sent for mass spectrometry analysis. The input and IRPCRP RNA were isolated using a MIRNeasy mini kit (Qiagen, #217004) following the standard protocol after proteinase K (Millipore Sigma, #71049) digestion.</p>
<p>For mass spectrometry analysis, the IRPCRP beads were processed for trypsin/LysC digestion before submitted to Thermo Scientific Orbitrap Exploris 240 Mass Spectrometer and a Thermo Dionex UltiMate 3000 RSLCnano System for Proteinomics. Peptides from trypsin digestion were loaded onto a peptide trap cartridge at a flow rate of 5 µl/min. The trapped peptides were eluted onto a reversed-phase Easy-Spray Column PepMap RSLC, C18, 2 µM, 100A, 75 µm × 250 mm (Thermo Scientific) using a linear gradient of acetonitrile (3-36%) in 0.1% formic acid. The elution duration was 110 min at a flow rate of 0.3 µl/min. Eluted peptides from the Easy-Spray column were ionized and sprayed into the mass spectrometer, using a Nano Easy-Spray Ion Source (Thermo Fisher Scientific) under the following settings: spray voltage, 1.6 kV, Capillary temperature, 275 °C. Other settings were empirically determined. Raw data files were searched against human protein sequences database using the Proteome Discoverer 2.4 software (Thermo Fisher Scientific, San Jose, CA) based on the SEQUEST algorithm. All the protein peptides identified in the IRPCRP pulldowns were summarized in Table S4.</p>

<caption><p>Pathway map of RAS Initiative with highlighted differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in ΔPr-A9 cells vs parental wild type cells. DEGs are mainly distributed and clustered in two main branches of RAS pathway: MAPK signaling branch and PI3K/AKT branches. DEGs were derived from RNA-seq data at cutoff of adjusted p-value &lt;=0.01 and fold change&gt;1.5 for both up- and down-regulated genes (indicated by red and blue arrows respectively) between A9 cells vs WT CaSki cells using three common analysis methods (DESeq2, edgeR, and limma-voom) and in-house BRB analysis pipeline from NCI. Highlighted genes in the pathway map are derived as DEGs in at least three of the analysis methods, although in most cases, these DEGs behaved consistently across all 4 methods. MAPK signaling branch is highlighted in transparent green box and PI3K/AKT branch is highlighted in transparent yellow box within the pathway map of RAS signaling pathway, which was collectively collated from community inputs that were organized and stimulated by RAS Initiative, and maintained as a common knowledge basis at URL below: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.cancer.gov/research/key-initiatives/ras/ras-central/blog/2015/ras-pathway-v2">https://www.cancer.gov/research/key-initiatives/ras/ras-central/blog/2015/ras-pathway-v2</ext-link>, which was also described in recent review (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref> in Nissley and McCormick, 2022).</p>

<caption><p>Expression levels of lnc-FANCI-2 and MCAM are significantly associated with TCGA CESC cancer patients’ survival outcome. The expression of Inc-FANCI-2 (A) and of MCAM (B) along with survival of the same group of 304 cervical cancer patients were analyzed by our in-house GradientScanSurv pipeline as described (Yi et al 2018, PLoS One 13(12):e0207590). The <bold>open grey circles</bold> in each plot are ranked expression levels from high (left) to low (right) of Inc-FANCI-2 (A) and MCAM (B) from all patient samples as indicated by y-axis at the right side of the plot (in RSEM normalized value of RNAseq data). At each breaking point denoted by patient number (x-axis), the log rank test (y-axis at the left side of the plot) was performed between the higher expression group at the left side of the cut-point vs the lower expression group at the right side of the cut-point and the indicated log rank p-values (<bold>blue dots</bold>) are shown as at each cut-point at x-axis. The <bold>horizontal red line</bold> is the p=0.05 cutoff line for the log rank test p-values. If a log rank p-value (<bold>blue dot</bold>) at a cut-point is below the cutoff (p&lt;0.05), there will be a <bold>vertical green line</bold> shown at the corresponding cut-point, indicative of a significant log rank test p-value, and also a <bold>brown</bold> diamond plotted either at the bottom part of the <bold>vertical green line</bold> (A) if higher expression of lnc-FANCI-2 led to less severe outcome (dying slower than the lower expressors), or at the top part of the <bold>vertical green line</bold> (B) if higher expression of MCAM led to more severe outcome (dying faster than the lower expressors).</p>
<p>The original GoodCount was defined as the number of significant log rank tests (the default significance level was set as 0.05) across all possible cut-points for the original dataset. We employed the bootstrap approach to permutate the data for 1000 times in this case, and for each time, a similar procedure was performed like the original dataset, and a permutated GoodCount was obtained for each permutated dataset. The GoodCount p-value was derived as the proportion of the times that the GoodCounts of permutated datasets were no less than that of the original dataset (see Yi et al 2018, PLoS One 13(12):e0207590) and shown at the left top corner of each plot, 0.014 for Inc-FANCI-2 in panel A and 0.004 for MCAM in panel B. A significant GoodCount p-value (<bold>blue dots</bold> in both panels A and B) is indicative of significant association of the expression levels with the corresponding survival outcomes of the analyzed patient samples. Derived p-values from univariant expression-based cox regression models (coxph p-value: derived by original gene expression values; or coxph p-value By Rank: derived by corresponding ranks of gene expression values) were shown at the top left corner of each plot. The cut-point-specific FDR (<bold>green dots</bold>) and FDR2 (<bold>red dots</bold>) were shown at the top right corner of each plot. FDR for each cut-point was defined as the portion of cases of permutated datasets that have log rank test p-values no higher than that of original dataset. FDR2 for each cut-point was defined as the portion of cases of permutated datasets that have log rank test p-values no higher than default setting of significance as 0.05.</p></caption>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors attempted to dissect the function of a long non-coding RNA, lnc-FANCI-2, in cervical cancer. They profiled lnc-FANCI-2 in different cell lines and tissues, generated knockout cell lines, and characterized the gene using multiple assays.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>A large body of experimental data has been presented and can serve as a useful resource for the scientific community, including transcriptomics and proteomics datasets. The reported results also span different parts of the regulatory network and open up multiple avenues for future research.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The write-up is somewhat unfocused and lacks deep mechanistic insights in some places.</p>

<p>The study by Liu et al provides a functional analysis of lnc-FANCI-2 in cervical carcinogenesis, building on their previous discovery of FANCI-2 being upregulated in cervical cancer by HPV E7.</p>
<p>The authors conducted a comprehensive investigation by knocking out (KO) FANCI-2 in CaSki cells and assessing viral gene expression, cellular morphology, altered protein expression and secretion, altered RNA expression through RNA sequencing (verification of which by RT-PCR is well appreciated), protein binding, etc. Verification experiments by RT-PCR, Western blot, etc are notable strengths of the study.</p>
<p>The KO and KD were related to increased Ras signaling and EMT and reduced IFN-y/a responses.</p>
<p>Although the large amount of data is well acknowledged, it is a limitation that most data come from CaSki cells, in which FANCI-2 localization is different from SiHa cells and cancer tissues (Figure 1). The cytoplasmic versus nuclear localization is somewhat puzzling.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>A long noncoding RNA, lnc-FANCI-2, was reported to be regulated by HPV E7 oncoprotein and a cell transcription factor, YY1 by this group. The current study focuses on the function of lnc-FANCI-2 in HPV-16 positive cervical cancer is to intrinsically regulate RAS signaling, thereby facilitating our further understanding of additional cellular alterations during HPV oncogenesis. The authors used advanced technical approaches such as KO, transcriptome and (IRPCRP) and LC- MS/MS analyses in the current study and concluded that KO Inc-FANCI-2 significantly increases RAS signaling, especially phosphorylation of Akt and Erk1/2.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) HPV E6E7 are required for full immortalization and maintenance of the malignant phenotype of cervical cancer, but they are NOT sufficient for full transformation and tumorigenesis. This study helps further understanding of other cellular alterations in HPV oncogenesis.</p>
<p>(2) lnc-FANCI-2 is upregulated in cervical lesion progression from CIN1, CIN2-3 to cervical cancer, cancer cell lines, and HPV transduced cell lines.</p>
<p>(3) Viral E7 of high-risk HPVs and host transcription factor YY1 are two major factors promoting lnc-FANCI-2 expression.</p>
<p>(4) Proteomic profiling of cytosolic and secreted proteins showed inhibition of MCAM, PODXL2, and ECM1 and increased levels of ADAM8 and TIMP2 in KO cells.</p>
<p>(5) RNA-seq analyses revealed that KO cells exhibited significantly increased RAS signaling but decreased IFN pathways.</p>
<p>(6) Increased phosphorylated Akt and Erk1/2, IGFBP3, MCAM, VIM, and CCND2 (cyclin D2) and decreased RAC3 were observed in KO cells.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) The authors observed the increased Inc-FANCI-2 in HPV 16 and 18 transduced cells, and other cervical cancer tissues as well, HPV-18 positive HeLa cells exhibited different expressions of Inc-FANCI-2.</p>
<p>(2) Previous studies and data in the current showed a steadily increased Inc-FANCI-2 during cancer progression, however, the authors did not observe significant changes in cell behaviors (both morphology and proliferation) in KO Inc-FANCI-2.</p>
<p>(3) The authors observed the significant changes of RAS signaling (downstream) in KO cells, but they provided limited interpretations of how these results contributed to full transformation or tumorigenesis in HPV-positive cancer.</p>
