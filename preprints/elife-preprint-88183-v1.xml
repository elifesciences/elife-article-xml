<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Chronic cardiovascular and metabolic diseases have been linked with oral inflammation in the tooth-supporting gingiva. Therefore, elucidating the mechanisms underlying development of gingival inflammation may hold critical insight into the pathogenesis of these debilitating non-communicable diseases. Here, we report a unique fibroblast subpopulation <underline>a</underline>ctivated to <underline>g</underline>uide oral inflammation (AG fibroblasts), identified in a single-cell RNA sequencing-based gingival cell atlas constructed from the mouse ligature-induced periodontitis model. Collagen-XIV-positive AG fibroblasts localized beneath gingival epithelium express chemokine ligands and Toll-like receptor-related molecules upon ligature placement, which were linked to receptors expressed by neutrophils and lymphocytes, including innate lymphoid cells (ILCs). We further identify ILCs as the primary source of proinflammatory interleukin-17 cytokines and show that cervical alveolar bone resorption is absent in Rag2<sup>-/-</sup>γc<sup>-/-</sup>, but not Rag2<sup>-/-</sup>, mice suggesting ILC3s mediate the human periodontitis-like phenotype. We therefore propose AG fibroblasts function as a previously unrecognized surveillant to orchestrate chronic gingival inflammation in periodontitis.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The oral mucosa must constantly respond to a diverse array of oral microbes, as well as to dietary and airborne antigens, making it one of the most active barrier tissues in the human body<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. Consequently, oral barrier immunity acts as a crucial surveillance system, which must defend from pathogenic organisms, while ensuring sustained tolerance of commensal microbes and harmless antigens, without excessive inflammation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. Within this system, the junction between the gingiva and the tooth surface represents a weak link, wherein the initiation of localized inflammation often leads to chronic gingivitis and periodontitis. Once this gingival inflammation progresses, adjacent alveolar bone supporting the cervical area of the dentition is subjected to a localized, but often severe, osteoclastic bone resorption, resulting in tooth loss and disruption of the maxillofacial structure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>. Globally, periodontitis ranks among the most significant contributors to poor health and decreased quality of life, imposing substantial economic and healthcare burdens, particularly in low and middle-income countries<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. It is therefore acutely important to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying the initiation of gingival inflammation, in order to facilitate the development of effective preventive and therapeutic measures for this debilitating condition.</p>
<p>Critically, periodontitis is not only the most frequent cause of tooth loss in adults<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>, it is also associated with a number of severe non-communicable diseases, such as metabolic and cardiovascular diseases. A recent systematic review revealed that type 2 diabetes mellitus patients had significantly worse periodontal status with more tooth loss, and the presence of severe periodontitis increased the incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus by 53%<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>. Chronic inflammatory conditions are also known to increase the risk of cardiovascular diseases, including valvular heart disease. Recently, a possible association has been recognized between periodontal inflammation—distinct from transient bacteremia due to dental procedures—and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. Although a direct causal relationship between these non-communicative diseases and periodontitis has not been established, it is postulated that periodontitis triggers an inflammatory cascade that begins in oral barrier tissues and subsequently spreads throughout the body. Thus, elucidating the mechanisms underlying periodontitis development may further provide insight on the signaling pathways that induce and sustain systemic inflammation.</p>
<p>Clinical characterization of periodontitis patients and observations made during treatment have not yielded a comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms that promote periodontal disease. Rather, our current model for the pathological framework of periodontitis has been reconstructed from animal models, harvested immune cell analyses, and oral microbial associations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>. Of particular importance has been the development of a ligature-induced periodontitis model in mice, combined with targeted gene mutations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>. This model has shown that fully developed periodontal inflammation is closely associated with the abundant recruitment and excessive activation of neutrophils<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup> and pathological induction of interleukin (IL)-17–secreting proinflammatory effector CD4<sup>+</sup> T helper (Th)17 cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. Based on our current understanding of osteoimmunology, it was hypothesized that these pathological immune cells activate osteoclasts, leading to induction of periodontal alveolar bone resorption<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>. However, the precise cascade of events leading to this pathological outcome has not been fully deciphered.</p>
<p>Investigation of the molecular mechanisms underlying chronic inflammation in immunological disorders is an intense area of research. Prior studies have shown that chemokines are involved in the trafficking and activation of inflammatory cells during both homeostasis and disease-associated inflammation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. These small proteins, which typically contain disulfide cysteine–cysteine (CC) and cysteine–X–cysteine (CXC) molecular signatures, act as ligands for cellular receptors that modulate inflammatory signaling pathways<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. Such chemokine–receptor networks direct the migration of inflammatory cells, potentially amplifying the resulting tissue damage. However, in addition to immune cells, barrier tissues are also composed of epithelial cells and fibroblastic stromal cells, and increasing evidence suggests that stromal cells are involved in innate immune cell regulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. In particular, we and others have found that oral fibroblasts secrete cytokines and chemokines in response to microbial stimuli or a proinflammatory environment, suggesting a possible mechanism by which they may regulate immune cell function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>. Therefore, a comprehensive elucidation of chemokine–receptor signaling networks will likely need to include all types of gingival cells.</p>
<p>In the present study, to better understand the pathways contributing to chronic oral inflammation, we determined the gingival single-cell transcriptomic atlas of mice with ligature-induced periodontitis and identified a novel subpopulation of fibroblasts <underline>a</underline>ctivated to <underline>g</underline>uide chronic inflammation (AG fibroblasts). Our findings suggest that chemokines and ligands derived from AG fibroblasts bind to and activate receptors involved in neutrophil and lymphocyte activation. We further show that <italic>Cd4</italic><sup>-</sup> innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) produce proinflammatory IL-17 cytokines in the inflamed gingiva, and provide evidence that type 3 ILCs (ILC3s) are responsible for cervical alveolar bone resorption in mice—a pathological feature consistent with the human periodontitis phenotype. Thus, the results from this study identify the AG fibroblast– neutrophil–ILC3 axis as a previously unrecognized mechanism contributing to pathological inflammation in periodontitis.</p>

<title>Myeloid cell composition and activity during periodontitis development</title>
<p>The infiltration of proinflammatory neutrophils into the gingiva has been extensively characterized in this mouse model of periodontitis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>. Here, we found that macrophages expressing cluster of differentiation 86 (<italic>Cd86</italic>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup> and integrin subunit alpha X (<italic>Itgax)</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup> were predominant on Day 0 in the myeloid cell fraction from healthy gingiva (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 2A</bold></xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig"><bold>B</bold></xref>— <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig"><bold>figure supplement 3</bold></xref>). In contrast, the proportion of neutrophils expressing CXC motif chemokine receptor (<italic>Cxcr2</italic>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup> and G0/G1 switch gene 2 (<italic>G0s2</italic>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup> increased after ligature placement and during periodontitis development from Day 1 to 7 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 2A</bold></xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig"><bold>B</bold></xref>—<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig"><bold>figure supplement 3</bold></xref>), suggesting continuous neutrophil infiltration into the early and established gingival lesion. Moreover, after ligature placement, gingival neutrophils upregulated the expression of triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 1 (<italic>Trem1</italic>), indicating that these cells are activated and participating in the amplification of inflammatory signals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 2C</bold></xref>).

<p>Myeloid cells are also known to stimulate other immune cells through the expression of CC motif chemokine ligands (CCLs) and CXC motif chemokine ligands (CXCLs), many of which are associated with periodontitis development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup>.

<title>Fibroblasts activated to guide leukocyte migration in periodontitis development</title>
<p>We previously identified two distinct subpopulations of gingival fibroblasts, differentiated by expression of type XIV collagen (<italic>Col14a1</italic>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>, and these were also detected in our current scRNA-seq data from Day 0 to 7 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 3A</bold></xref>). Gene ontogeny (GO) enrichment analysis of the <italic>Col14a1</italic>-expressing fibroblast subpopulation revealed expression of major gene clusters related to immune regulation, including “Regulation of leukocyte migration” (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 3B</bold></xref>). This immune regulatory phenotype appears to be unique to <italic>Col14a1</italic>-expressing fibroblasts, which are therefore referred to as ‘fibroblasts activated to <underline>g</underline>uide leukocyte migration’ or AG fibroblasts. The other subpopulation of <italic>Col1a1</italic>-expressing fibroblasts appeared to keep typical fibroblastic features and is thus referred to as KT fibroblasts (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 3C</bold></xref>). An additional fibroblast subpopulation expressing smooth muscle aortic actin 2 (<italic>Acta2</italic>) was detected on Day 7, and these were identified as myofibroblasts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup> (MF) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 3A</bold></xref>). We found that the proportions of KT and AG fibroblasts were equal on Day 0 and on Days 1 and 4 after ligature placement (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 3E</bold></xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig"><bold>F</bold></xref>).

<title>AG fibroblasts and immune surveillance in periodontitis development</title>
<p>To further characterize AG fibroblasts and their “Regulation of leukocyte migration” phenotype, we analyzed expression of CCL and CXCL chemokines within fibroblast subpopulations in our scRNA-seq dataset<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>.

Chemokine expression levels then decreased on Day 7, suggesting that AG fibroblasts might initiate early leukocyte migration into gingival tissue. Given that activation of Toll-like receptors (TLR) is known to increase chemokine expression, we further assessed expression of TLRs in fibroblast subpopulations. We found that AG fibroblasts displayed temporal activation of <italic>Tlr2, Tlr3</italic>, and <italic>Tlr4</italic> expression on Days 1 and 4 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 4B</bold></xref>).

<title>Role of AG fibroblasts in myeloid cell activation</title>
<p>The interaction between chemokine ligands and their receptors has been extensively studied. Here, to evaluate the interaction between chemokine ligands strongly expressed by AG fibroblasts and chemokine receptors in innate immune cells, we matched AG fibroblast-expressed chemokines to expression of their putative receptors in myeloid cells.

<title>The role of AG fibroblasts and neutrophils in ILC3 development in periodontitis</title>
<p>Based on our present data, we hypothesize that ILC3s within the gingival tissue play a pathological role in alveolar bone resorption in our mouse model. We therefore aimed to identify the cells that promote ILC3 development in mice. Similar to Th17 cells, ILC3 development was shown to be triggered by IL-6 and IL-23a<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref></sup>.

<p>Lastly, we evaluated potential interactions between chemokine ligands expressed by AG fibroblasts and neutrophils and chemokine receptors in innate immune cells.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we used scRNA-seq to generate a gingival cell transcriptomic atlas across the time course of periodontal inflammation development, leading to pathological alveolar bone resorption, in a mouse ligature-induced model of disease. Our results suggest the presence of a unique and previously uncharacterized subpopulation of gingival fibroblasts, referred to as AG fibroblasts, which show upregulated expression of TLRs and chemokines immediately after ligature placement (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 3</bold></xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig"><bold>4</bold></xref>). Previous studies have proposed that TLR-expressing gingival fibroblasts regulate innate immune responses in the oral barrier tissue<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref></sup>; however, the precise mechanisms underlying this fibroblast-mediated regulation remained poorly understood. Here, we found that not all gingival fibroblasts acquired an immune-sensing capability, but rather, AG fibroblasts represent a distinct fibroblast subpopulation, capable of upregulating TLRs and potentially responding to microbial and tissue damage signals. Consistent with this possibility, the temporal expression of TLRs was found to be associated with increased expression of CC and CXC chemokine ligands.</p>
<p>The signature gene of AG fibroblasts is <italic>Col14a1</italic>, which encodes a member of the Fibril-Associated Collagen with Interrupted Triple-helices (FACIT) superfamily<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref></sup>. To our knowledge, our present findings represent the first observation of COL14A1 in the gingiva (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 4</bold></xref>). However, in a previous study, we detected COL14A1-positive AG fibroblasts immediately under the gingival epithelium and in the cervical region of PDL, making them ideally situated to mediate immune surveillance for oral stimuli and microbial signals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>. Given the strategic localization within the gingiva and the temporal expression of TLRs and chemokines after ligature placement, we hypothesize that AG fibroblasts play a previously unrecognized role in innate immune regulation during periodontitis development.</p>
<p>Neutrophils are well-established as crucial players in periodontitis progression. One study found that gingival neutrophils in chronic periodontitis patients are longer-lived than those from healthy patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref></sup>. Moreover, it was shown that dysregulated neutrophils can induce destruction of periodontal connective tissue through the production of toxic molecules, such as reactive oxygen species, leading to initiation of bone resorption<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref></sup>. Critically, neutrophil function in periodontitis is dependent on trafficking to the affected gingiva, and accordingly, we found that the proportion of neutrophils increased after ligature placement (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 2</bold></xref>). Neutrophils were previously reported to express a relatively limited number of chemokine receptors, including CXCR2, CXCR4, and CCR1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref></sup>. Consistent with prior studies, we detected expression of these chemokine receptors in gingival neutrophils and linked them to ligands expressed by AG fibroblasts—CXCL1, CXCL12, and CCL8, respectively (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 5</bold></xref><bold>).</bold> In addition to chemokines, neutrophils can respond to various chemoattractants that modulate and finetune various cellular behaviors, such as migration direction, adhesion strength, and functional heterogeneity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref></sup>. Here, we observed evidence for substantial intracellular communication between AG fibroblasts and neutrophils through ligand–target gene interactions (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 5</bold></xref>). Although validation of each putative ligand–receptor interaction is beyond the scope of this study, our data suggest that AG fibroblasts may play an important role in neutrophil trafficking in both early and established periodontitis lesions.</p>
<p>A primary pathological consequence of periodontitis is uncontrolled alveolar bone resorption, leading to tooth loss, which is thought to be mediated by osteoimmune pathways involving IL-17–expressing Th17 cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref></sup>. In contrast, analysis of our scRNA-seq revealed expression of <italic>Ror</italic>γ<italic>, Il17a</italic>, and <italic>Il17f</italic> not in CD4<sup>+</sup> Th cells, but rather, in lymphocytes with ILC characteristics (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 6</bold></xref>). ILCs share phenotypic and functional features with CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, although they lack antigen-specific T cell receptors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></sup>. In particular, the gingival ILCs detected in our study strongly expressed <italic>Ror</italic>γ, <italic>Il17a,</italic> and <italic>Il17f,</italic> but not <italic>Tbx21</italic> and <italic>Gata3,</italic> indicating they are ILC3s, which are functionally similar to Th17 cells. Notably, recent clinical studies have reported the presence of ILCs in gingiva from human periodontitis patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref></sup> and leptin receptor–deficient mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref></sup>. However, the specific role of these cells in alveolar bone loss had not been previously established.</p>
<p>In the present study, we explored the role of ILC3s in periodontitis-associated bone loss using Rag2<sup>-/-</sup> and Rag2<sup>-/-</sup>γc<sup>-/-</sup> mice and observed differential patterns of alveolar bone resorption following ligature placement in these animals. Rag2<sup>-/-</sup> mutation prevents V(D)J recombination required for generating immunoglobulin and T cell receptors, resulting in the production of functionally immature B and T cells, including Th17 cells. However, ILCs do not undergo genomic receptor rearrangements and, thus, are unaffected by Rag2<sup>-/-</sup> mutation. In contrast, Rag2<sup>-/-</sup>γc<sup>-/-</sup> mice have the Rag2<sup>-/-</sup> mutation in combination with the Il2rg<sup>-/-</sup> mutation, which disables common γ chain cytokines (γc). Therefore, in addition to non-functional B and T cells, these animals also have defective γc-dependent ILCs. Here, we found that Rag2<sup>-/-</sup> mice contained a reduced number of osteoclasts in the apical PDL area, indicative of reduced bone resorption in this region, whereas a significant loss of bone resorption was present in both the cervical and apical PDL areas of Rag2<sup>-/-</sup>γc<sup>-/-</sup> mice (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 7</bold></xref>). Human periodontitis induces alveolar bone at the cervical PDL zone relative to the gingival legion. In contrast, apical alveolar bone resorption is observed in clinical cases of root canal infection (apical periodontitis). Therefore, our findings suggest that ILCs, which are differentially impacted by Rag2<sup>-/-</sup>γc<sup>-/-</sup> <italic>vs</italic>. Rag2<sup>-/-</sup> mutation, may be involved in human periodontitis-like alveolar bone resorption near the site of gingival inflammation. It must be noted that Rag2<sup>-/-</sup> and Rag2<sup>-/-</sup>γc<sup>-/-</sup> mice developed gingival defects similar to WT mice. However, this observation may be explained by results from our previous study, which suggest that early gingival degradation in the mouse model is mediated by cathepsin K (CTSK) secreted from gingival fibroblasts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>, rather than by activated lymphocytes.</p>
<p>Differentiation of ILC3s and Th17 cells is mediated by similar environmental cues, with IL- 6 and IL-23a playing critical roles in both pathways<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref></sup>. Our present scRNA-seq data (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 8</bold></xref>) suggest that AG fibroblasts and neutrophils are the primary cellular sources of <italic>Il6</italic> during the early and later stages, respectively, of periodontitis development. In contrast, <italic>Il23a</italic> was found to be expressed by a variety of cell types, such as AG fibroblasts, myeloid cells, and multiple subsets of epithelial cells, including those with an EMT phenotype<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref></sup>. Further, CC and CXC chemokine–receptor associations between ILC3s and both AG fibroblasts and neutrophils appeared to be non-specific. Therefore, our data suggest that rather than a specific trigger, the collective gingival environment, which includes AG fibroblasts, might contribute to ILC3 differentiation.</p>
<p>In conclusion, based on our present findings, we propose that a previously unrecognized AG fibroblast subpopulation in the gingiva can facilitate immune surveillance and participate in the pathological regulation of innate immune cells, such as proinflammatory neutrophils, within oral barrier tissue (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 9</bold></xref>). Moreover, we hypothesize that ILC3s in the inflamed gingiva play a critical role in pathological alveolar bone resorption in the mouse model of periodontitis and, potentially, in human disease. Thus, the newly proposed AG fibroblast–neutrophil–ILC3 axis may hold valuable clues for unraveling the pathological mechanisms underlying periodontitis development. Moreover, these findings also provide a basis for investigation of new preventive and therapeutic strategies to contain oral barrier inflammation and potentially sever the link between periodontitis and debilitating non-communicative metabolic and cardiovascular diseases.</p>

<caption><p>Schematic overview of the newly proposed AG fibroblast–neutrophil–ILC3 axis. We propose that periodontal inflammation is initiated by the activation of AG fibroblasts, which secrete chemokines and cytokines that recruit neutrophils to sites of tissue damage. Activated neutrophils and AG fibroblasts, in turn, activate ILC3s, leading to production of proinflammatory IL-17 cytokines. Ultimately, cervical alveolar bone resorption is facilitated by a localized osteoclastogenic environment, induced by activated ILC3s, together with AG fibroblasts, neutrophils, myofibroblasts, and gingival epithelial cells, including those with an epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) phenotype.</p></caption>

<title>Animal care</title>
<p>All protocols for animal experiments were reviewed and approved by the University of California Los Angeles (UCLA) Animal Research Committee (ARC# 2003-009) and followed the Public Health Service Policy for the Humane Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and the UCLA Animal Care and Use Training Manual guidelines. C57BL/6J WT, Rag2<sup>-/-</sup>, and Rag2<sup>-/-</sup>γc<sup>-/-</sup> mice were purchased from the Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME, USA). Animals had free access to regular rodent diet and water and were maintained in standard housing conditions with 12-h light/dark cycles in the Division of Laboratory Animal Medicine at UCLA.</p>

<title>Evaluation of gingival defect and alveolar bone resorption in a ligature-induced mouse model of periodontitis</title>
<p>A silk thread was gently tied around the left maxillary second molar of 8- to 12-week-old female WT, Rag2<sup>-/-</sup>, and Rag2<sup>-/-</sup>γc<sup>-/-</sup> mice under general inhalation anesthesia with isoflurane (Henry Schein, Melville, NY, USA). On Days 1, 3, and 7 after ligature placement, WT mice were randomly chosen and euthanized by 100% CO<sub>2</sub> inhalation. WT mice without ligature placement were used as Day 0 pre-periodontitis control. Rag2<sup>-/-</sup> and Rag2<sup>-/-</sup>γc<sup>-/-</sup> mice were euthanized on Day 7. The palatal tissue was digitally photographed, and maxillae were harvested and fixed in 10% buffered formalin (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). The gingival defect area was measured from digital photographs, using the ImageJ Java-based image-processing program (NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA), and normalized to the circumferential area of the maxillary first molar. Fixed maxillae were subjected to microCT imaging at an energy level of 60 kV and 166 µA, and 3D images were reconstructed from microCT scans (Skyscan 1275: Bruker, Billerica, MA, USA). Alveolar bone loss was assessed at three sites (mesiobuccal cusp, distobuccal cusp, and distal cusp) of the first molar, two sites (mesiobuccal cusp and distobuccal cusp) of the second molar, and one site (buccal cusp) of the third molar by measuring the distance from the cementoenamel junction (CEJ) to the alveolar bone crest (ABC) on the buccal and palatal side of the alveolar bone. Total bone loss was calculated from the six-site total CEJ–ABC distance. The bone volume/total volume (BV/TV) ratio, bone surface, trabecular number (Tb.N), and trabecular thickness (Tb.Th) in the buccal side of alveolar bone of the second molar were determined using the proprietary analysis program (CTan: Bruker, Billerica, MA, USA). Statistical analysis to assess differences among multiple experimental groups was performed using two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Tukey’s multiple-comparison test; <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant.</p>

<title>Collagenase II treatment</title>
<p>The tissues were cut into 1-mm pieces and placed immediately into digestion buffer, containing 1-mg/ml collagenase II (Life Technologies, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA), 10-units/ml DNase I (Sigma–Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA), and 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA; Sigma–Aldrich) in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM; Life Technologies). The tissues were incubated in digestion buffer for 20 min at 37 °C on a shaker at 150 rpm and then passed through a 70-µm cell strainer. The collected cells were pelleted at 1,500 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; Life Technologies), supplemented with 0.04% BSA (Cell suspension A).</p>

<p>Immediately following collagenase II treatment, tissues were incubated in 0.25% trypsin (Life Technologies) and 10-units/ml DNase I for 30 min at 37 °C on a 150-rpm shaker. Trypsin was neutralized with fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies), and the tissues were passed through a 70-µm cell strainer and washed with DMEM. The collected cells were then pelleted at 1,500 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C and resuspended in PBS with 0.04% BSA (Cell suspension B). Cell suspension A and Cell suspension B were combined in one tube.

<title>Cell clustering and Identification</title>
<p>Cell Ranger was used to align reads, generate feature–barcode matrices, and perform clustering and gene expression analyses on the scRNA-seq data, and the output from this program was analyzed using the R-program Seurat (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://satijalab.org/seurat/">https://satijalab.org/seurat/</ext-link>). Cells with &lt;2,400 genes detected or &gt;1% mitochondrial gene expression were filtered out as low-quality cells. Individual gene counts for each cell were divided by the total gene counts for that cell and multiplied by a scale factor of 10,000; natural-log transformation was then applied to the counts. The FindVariableFeatures function was used to select 2,000 variable genes with default parameters, and the ScaleData function was used to scale and center the counts in the dataset. Principal component analysis and Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection dimensional reduction were performed on variably expressed genes. The cluster markers were found using the FindAllMarkers function, and cell types were manually annotated based on the cluster markers. Cell types were assigned based on expression of cell marker genes, and gene expression within different cell types was displayed using dot plots and violin plots.</p>

<title>Histological analysis</title>
<p>Fixed maxillae were decalcified in 10% EDTA (Sigma–Aldrich) for 3 weeks and then embedded in paraffin. Histological cross-sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (HE) and evaluated on a light microscope. Adjacent paraffin sections (4 µm) were subjected to a heat-induced epitope retrieval procedure and then immunohistochemically stained with polyclonal antibodies to COL14A1 (#PA5-49916, Thermo Fisher Scientific) and CXCL12 (#PA5-30603, Thermo Fisher Scientific) at a 1:100 dilution, followed by secondary antibody application, diaminobenzidine staining, and methylene blue counterstaining.</p>
<p>Using maxillary cross-sections of WT, Rag2<sup>-/-</sup>, and Rag2<sup>-/-</sup>γc<sup>-/-</sup> mice, osteoclasts were evaluated by TRAP staining using a commercially available kit (Acid Phosphatase TRAP kit, Sigma–Aldrich), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. TRAP-positive cells were counted in the 0.01-mm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup> area.

<caption><p>Alveolar bone loss in the ligature-induced mouse periodontitis model. Alveolar bone loss was assessed at the mesiobuccal cusp (M1-1), distobuccal cusp (M1-2), and distal cusp (M1-3) of the first molar, the mesiobuccal cusp (M2-1) and distobuccal cusp (M2-2) of the second molar, and the buccal cusp (M3) of the third molar by measuring the distance from the cementoenamel junction (CEJ) to the alveolar bone crest (ABC) on the buccal or palatal side of the alveolar bone (<italic>n</italic> = 6). Significance was determined by analysis of variance (ANOVA), with Tukey’s multiple-comparison test. Data are presented as mean values ± standard deviation (SD); <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05 was considered significant.</p></caption>

<p>Results:</p>
<p>1.

<p>This study proposed the AG fibroblast-neutrophil-ILC3 axis as a mechanism contributing to pathological inflammation in periodontitis. However, the immune response in the vivo is very complex. It is difficult to determine which is the cause and which is the result. This study explores the relevant issue from one dimension, which is of great significance for a deeper understanding of the pathogenesis of periodontitis. It should be fully discussed.</p>
<p>1. Many host cells participate in immune responses, such as gingival epithelial cells. AG fibroblast is not the only cell involved in the immune response, and the weight of its role needs to be clarified. So the expression in the conclusion should be appropriate.</p>

<p><bold>eLife assessment</bold></p>
<p>The findings of this article provide valuable information on the changes of cell clusters induced by chronic periodontitis. The observation of a new fibroblast subpopulation, which was named as AG fibroblasts, was quite interesting, but needs further evidence. The strength of evidence presented is incomplete.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>RESPONSE: We discovered a new subpopulation of gingival fibroblasts, named AG fibroblasts, using non-biased single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) of mouse gingival samples undergoing the development of ligature-induced periodontitis. AG fibroblasts exhibited a unique gene expression profile: [1] constitutive expression of type XIV collagen; and [2] ligature-induced upregulation of chemokines such as CXCL12. As a biomedical data science experiment, we validated the scRNA-seq observation using immunohistochemical experiment, which showed the presence of type XIV collagen-positive and CXCL12-positive gingival fibroblasts localized immediately under the gingival epithelium and the coronal region of periodontal ligament.</p>
<p>We agree that the functional/pathological role of AG fibroblasts must be further explored. We have hypothesized that AG fibroblasts initially sense the pathological stress including oral microbial stimuli and secrete inflammatory signals through chemokine expression. To address this hypothesis, in this revision, we plan to analyze a separate scRNA-seq data for AG fibroblast gene expression profile derived from mouse gingival tissues that have been stimulated by Toll-Like Receptor 9 (TLR9) ligand (unmethylated CpG oligonucleotide) and TLR2/4 ligand (LPS). This approach mimics the initial pathological stress applied to gingival tissue. The new insight of AG fibroblasts will be presented in the revision.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>RESPONSE: We appreciate this comment. As suggested, we further investigated the surveillant function of AG fibroblasts by reanalyzing the scRNA-seq data for stress sensing receptors such as Toll-Like Receptors (TLR). Therefore, we analyzed AG fibroblast gene expression profile when the putative ligands to TLR2/4 and TLR9 are applied to mouse gingival tissue instead of ligature placement. We believe that this first step analysis should warrant to dissect further the function of AG fibroblasts in the future.</p>

<p>Results:</p>
<p>1. It is recommended to add HE staining and immunohistochemistry staining to observe the inflammation, tissue damage, and repair status from 0 to 7 days, so that readers can understand cell phenotype changes corresponding to the periodontitis stage. The observation index can include inflammation and vascular related indicators.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>RESPONSE: As recommended, representative histological figures will be included. We will further perform new immunohistochemistry experiment of mouse gingival tissue (D0, D1, D4, D7). We plan to highlight the infiltration of CD45+ immune cells. We also plan to highlight the progressive degeneration of gingival collagen fiber by picrosirius red staining.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. Figure 1A-1D can be placed in the supplementary figure.</p>

<p>RESPONSE: Combining the new data above, Figure 1 will be revised as suggested.</p>

<p>RESPONSE: A separate statistical method section is created. As pointed out, we used one-way ANOVA with post-hoc Tukey test (when multiple groups were compared).</p>
