<title>Abstract</title><p>Kinesin-3 is a family of microtubule-dependent motor proteins that transport various cargos within the cell. However, the mechanism underlying kinesin-3 activations remains largely elusive. In this study, we compared the biochemical properties of two <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> kinesin-3 family proteins, KLP-6 and UNC-104. Both KLP-6 and UNC-104 are predominantly monomeric in solution. As previously shown for UNC-104, non-processive KLP-6 monomer is converted to a processive motor when artificially dimerized. We present evidence that releasing the autoinhibition is sufficient to trigger dimerization of monomeric UNC-104 at nanomolar concentrations, which results in processive movement of UNC-104 on microtubules, although it has long been thought that enrichment in the phospholipid microdomain on cargo vesicles is required for the dimerization and processive movement of UNC-104. In contrast, KLP-6 remains to be a non-processive monomer even when its autoinhibition is unlocked, suggesting a requirement of other factors for full activation. By examining the differences between KLP-6 and UNC-104, we identified a coiled-coil domain called CC2 that is required for the efficient dimerization and processive movement of UNC-104. Our results suggest a common activation mechanism for kinesin-3 family members, while also highlighting their diversification.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Cellular morphogenesis depends on intracellular transport. Kinesins, also known as kinesin superfamily proteins (KIFs), are microtubule-dependent molecular motors that are essential for intracellular transport and cell division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Hirokawa et al., 2009</xref>). Among kinesins, the kinesin-3 family is mainly involved in intracellular transport, including axonal transport of synaptic materials, lysosomal transport, mitochondrial transport and intraflagellar transport of mechanoreceptor complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Chiba et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Guardia et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Morsci and Barr, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Nangaku et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Okada et al., 1995</xref>).</p>
<p>The functions and regulation of the kinesin-3 family have been elucidated through genetic studies in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> (<italic>C. elegans</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Chiba et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Cong et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Hall and Hedgecock, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Kumar et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Niwa et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Niwa et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Otsuka et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Wu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Zheng et al., 2014</xref>). <italic>C. elegans</italic> has three members of the kinesin-3 family: UNC-104, KLP-4 and KLP-6. UNC-104 transports synaptic vesicle precursors, mature synaptic vesicles and pre-synaptic membrane proteins in the axon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Hall and Hedgecock, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Oliver et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Otsuka et al., 1991</xref>). Its mammalian orthologs, KIF1A and KIF1Bβ, also play a role in the axonal transport of synaptic materials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Niwa et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Okada et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Zhao et al., 2001</xref>). Because mutations in KIF1A and KIF1Bβ have been associated with congenital disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Boyle et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Budaitis et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Klebe et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Zhao et al., 2001</xref>), <italic>C. elegans</italic> has been used to study the molecular mechanisms of pathogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Anazawa et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Chiba et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Lam et al., 2021</xref>). KLP-4, on the other hand, is responsible for the transport of glutamate receptor called GLR-1 in the dendrite. The transport of GLR-1 is significantly reduced in <italic>klp-4</italic> mutant worms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Monteiro et al., 2012</xref>). KLP-6 is an invertebrate specific kinesin-3 and transports a mechanosensory receptor complex in male cilia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Morsci and Barr, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Peden and Barr, 2005</xref>). This mechanoreceptor complex consists of LOV-1 and PKD-2, orthologs of mammalian polycystin-1 and polycystin-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Barr et al., 2001</xref>). In human, mutations in <italic>PKD-1</italic> or <italic>PKD-2</italic> gene which encodes polycystin-1 or polycystin-2 cause autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Hughes et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Mochizuki et al., 1996</xref>). In worms, mutations in <italic>klp-6</italic> gene lead to the reduction of LOV-1 and PKD-2 from the cilia and the male infertility because the mechanoreceptor complex is essential for male worms to locate the hermaphrodite vulva during mating behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Peden and Barr, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Among these kinesin-3 family members, extensive biochemical and structural analyses have been conducted on UNC-104 and KLP-6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Al-Bassam et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Klopfenstein et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Tomishige et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Wang et al., 2022</xref>). It has been proposed that these motors are regulated by a monomer-to-dimer conversion mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Al-Bassam et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Tomishige et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Wang et al., 2022</xref>). UNC-104 dimers, which are stabilized by fusing with a coiled-coil domain of kinesin-1, exhibit plus-end directed movement on microtubules, whereas purified UNC-104 monomers show only one-dimensional diffusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Soppina et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Tomishige et al., 2002</xref>). UNC-104 requires a high concentration (at least the range of 1 to 7 µM) for dimerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Tomishige et al., 2002</xref>). Furthermore, UNC-104 mini-motors, generated by deleting most of the stalk domains, have been shown to be enriched in phosphatidylinositol 4, 5-bisphosphate (PIP2) microdomains on artificial liposomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Klopfenstein et al., 2002</xref>). As a result, the mini-motor can efficiently transport PIP2-carrying vesicles in vitro. These results collectively suggested that the non-processive UNC-104 monomer is accumulated to high concentration and converted into an active dimer at PIP2 microdomains on the cargo membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Klopfenstein et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Tomishige et al., 2002</xref>). Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) analysis of UNC-104 and the X-ray structure of full length KLP-6 have revealed the autoinhibited state of kinesin-3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Al-Bassam et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Ren et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Wang et al., 2022</xref>). These structures suggest that stalk domains, including coiled-coil 1(CC1), Forkhead-associated (FHA) and coiled-coil 2 (CC2) domains, bind to the motor domain (MD) and the neck coiled-coil (NC) domain and inhibit the microtubule-dependent motor activity of kinesin-3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Ren et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Wang et al., 2022</xref>).</p>
<p>Based on the genetic screening and the crystal structure, point mutations that disrupt the autoinhibition of UNC-104 and KLP-6 have been identified. These prior studies have indirectly detected the activation of UNC-104 and KLP-6 by observing the localization of cargo vesicles, measuring ATPase activity or observing tip accumulation in neuronal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Cong et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Niwa et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Wagner et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Wang et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Wu et al., 2013</xref>). However, we still lack insights into oligomeric states of UNC-104 and KLP-6 at submicromolar. Without direct visualization of purified UNC-104 and KLP-6 itself at low nanomolar concentration, it is difficult to determine whether UNC-104 and KLP-6 are capable of dimerization on their own upon autoinhibition release or whether other cellular factors are required for their dimerization. Furthermore, confirming that UNC-104 and KLP-6 motors form dimers at physiological concentration is necessary, since the concentration of most cellular proteins is at the range of nanomolar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Wuhr et al., 2014</xref>).</p>
<p>In this study, we conducted mass photometry assays and single-molecule motility assays to investigate the oligomeric state and motility of two purified <italic>C. elegans</italic> kinesin-3 motors, KLP-6 and UNC-104. Our results demonstrate that UNC-104, but not KLP-6, can form a dimer on its own in solution at nanomolar concentrations when autoinhibition is released. We also found that a previously unexplored coiled-coil domain, called the CC2 domain, is essential for the formation of UNC-104 dimers at nanomolar concentrations. The CC2 domain was essential for the processive movement of UNC-104. Unlocking of the autoinhibition alone was sufficient to induce the dimerization and activation of UNC-104 without the binding with cargo vesicles.</p>

<title>Full length KLP-6 is a monomeric motor</title>
<p>Although the full length structure of KLP-6 has been solved previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Wang et al., 2022</xref>), its biochemical properties have not been thoroughly examined. Here, we have characterized the motile properties of a recombinant KLP-6 construct consisting of full length KLP-6 (aa 1-928) with a C-terminal green fluorescent protein (KLP-6FL) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). In a size exclusion chromatography (SEC), KLP-6FL was eluted from a single peak (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>), corresponding to the size of monomeric KLP-6FL, as in the previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Wang et al., 2022</xref>). Mass photometry confirmed that KLP-6FL was monomeric in solution (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>). We found purified KLP-6FL was an active microtubule-dependent motor in a microtubule gliding assay (Fig S1). Firstly, KLP-6-FL was attached on the glass surface using an anti-GFP antibody. In this condition, the velocity of the movement in the gliding assay (52.4 ± 33.9 nm/sec, Mean ± Standard deviation (S.D.), n = 115 microtubules) was approximately 14 times lower than that of KLP-6::GFP in cilia (0.72 ± 0.18 µm/sec) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Morsci and Barr, 2011</xref>) (Fig. S1A and B). Secondly, KLP-6FL was attached on the glass surface directly. This led to an increased velocity in the gliding assay (154.9 ± 20.3 µm/sec, Mean ± S.D., n = 127 microtubules) (Fig. S1A and B), implying that such attachment activates the motor in the gliding assay. We next examined KLP-6FL processivity by imaging single GFP-labeled molecules using a total internal reflection fluorescent (TIRF) microscope. Our results showed that KLP-6FL bound to microtubules and exhibited one-dimensional diffusion, but rarely showed directional movement (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>).</p>

<title>KLP-6 has a second microtubule-binding domain in the tail</title>
<p>While we observed KLP-6FL bound to microtubules and showed diffusion on microtubules (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>), the structure of KLP-6 shows that the stalk domains of KLP-6 cover its motor domain (MD) and prevent the MD from binding to microtubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Wang et al., 2022</xref>). This raised a possibility that the tail domain of KLP-6 bind to microtubules in the autoinhibited state. To test this hypothesis, we purified deletion mutants of KLP-6 and examined their association with microtubules. We found that KLP-6(350-928), which lacks the MD, and KLP-6(580-928), which lacks the MD-NC-CC1-FHA domains, bound to microtubules (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). Inversely, KLP-6(1-587), lacking the MBS and MATH domains, rarely bound to microtubules. However, KLP-6(1-390), which lacks the CC1-FHA-CC2 domains, was able to bind to microtubules. Note that none of the KLP-6 proteins showed processive movement on microtubules (Fig. S2A-C). These suggests that KLP-6 has an second microtubule binding domain in the tail domains.</p>

<title>KLP-6 is converted to a processive motor by dimerization</title>
<p>KLP-6(1-390) but not KLP-6(1-587), bound to microtubules (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). This result is consistent with previous findings showing that the CC1-FHA-CC2 domains can inhibit the motor activity in kinesin-3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Hammond et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Niwa et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Wang et al., 2022</xref>). Although KLP-6(1-390) did not show any processive runs on microtubules in the TIRF assay (Fig. S2A), we found KLP-6(1-390) is an active microtubule-dependent motor in a microtubule gliding assay (Fig. S1C). The motor was attached on the glass surface using the anti-GFP antibody and the velocity of microtubule gliding was 120.8 ± 15.3 nm/sec (Mean ± S.D., n = 180 microtubules). For kinesin-3 motors, it has been proposed that dimerization is required to achieve processive runs on microtubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Soppina et al., 2014</xref>). Therefore, we dimerized KLP-6(1-390) using the LZ domain of GCN4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Soppina et al., 2014</xref>) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3, A</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">B</xref>). As a result, we found KLP-6(1-390)LZ moved on microtubules processively in the TIRF assay (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3, C-E</xref>). The velocity was 0.26 ± 0.12 µm/sec (Mean ± S.D., n = 642 molecules). These results suggest that KLP-6 is an inactive monomer and requires dimerization to perform directional movement on microtubules.</p>

<title>KLP-6 remains to be a non-processive monomer when the autoinhibition is relieved</title>
<p>In a previous study, UNC-104(1-653) was shown to be a monomeric and inactive protein, also known as U653 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Tomishige et al., 2002</xref>). KLP-6(1-587) has a similar domain architecture to UNC-104(1-653) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figs. 4A</xref> and S3) and was an inactive motor. To investigate the activation mechanisms of kinesin-3, we analyzed KLP-6(1-587) and UNC-104(1-653) more. Wang et al. identified mutations that disrupt the autoinhibition of KLP-6 based on its autoinhibited structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Wang et al., 2022</xref>). It was demonstrated that these mutations activate KLP-6 in cultured cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Wang et al., 2022</xref>). Among mutations analyzed in their study, KLP-6(D458A), a mutation that disrupts the intramolecular interaction between the FHA domain and MD, has the strongest effect on the activation of KLP-6 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref> and S4) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Wang et al., 2022</xref>). Therefore, we introduced the D458A mutation into KLP-6(1-587) to create a mutant protein, KLP-6(1-587)(D458A). KLP-6(1-587)(D458A) exhibited similar properties to wild-type KLP-6(1-587) in the SEC analysis (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>). Subsequent mass photometry confirmed that both KLP-6(1-587) and KLP-6(1-587)(D458A) were predominantly monomeric in solution (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>). Under the condition of the microtubule gliding assay with the anti-GFP antibody, KLP-6(1-587) (116.7 ± 17.9 nm/sec, Mean ± S.D., n = 107 microtubules) as well as KLP-6(1-587)(D458A) (114.3 ± 18.9 nm/sec, Mean ± S.D., n = 103 microtubules) exhibited comparable activity to KLP −6 (1-390) (120.8 ± 15.3 nm/sec, Mean ± S.D., n = 180 microtubules) even without attaching the motor to the surface directly (Fig. S1D). Despite these similar properties between KLP-6(1-587) and KLP-6(1-587)(D458A) in the gliding assay, KLP-6(1-587)(D458A), but not wild type KLP-6(1-587), frequently bound to microtubules in the TIRF assay (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4, D-F</xref>). However, KLP-6(1-587)(D458A) only exhibited one-dimensional diffusion and did not show any processive runs on microtubules (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref>). Considering that KLP-6(1-390)LZ dimers, but not KLP-6(1-390) monomers, are processive, these observations indicate that the autoinhibition of KLP-6(1-587)(D458A) is relieved but that KLP-6(1-587)(D458A) still cannot form processive dimers.</p>

<title>UNC-104 is converted to a processive dimer when the autoinhibition is relieved</title>
<p>Our previous work has identified mutations in the CC1 domain of UNC-104, such as UNC-104(E412K), that activate axonal transport of synaptic vesicle precursors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Niwa et al., 2016</xref>). Autoinhibited KLP-6 and KIF13B structures suggest that the E412K mutation in the UNC-104 disrupts the autoinhibition of UNC-104 (Fig S4) similarly to the KLP-6(D458A) mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Ren et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Wang et al., 2022</xref>). Therefore, we introduced the E412K mutation into UNC-104 and analyzed biochemical properties (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>). UNC-104(1-653) exhibited two peaks in the SEC analysis (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>), corresponding to the size of dimers and monomers, respectively. UNC-104(1-653) predominantly eluted in the monomer peak (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>, lower panel). This monomer peak fraction was subjected to a re-run in the SEC analysis. After incubating for sufficient time, we observed that the monomeric fraction re-equilibrated into two peaks, resembling the results from the initial SEC analysis of UNC-104(1-653) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref> and S5). Unlike KLP-6(1-587), UNC-104(1-653) exhibited a clear peak shift in the SEC analysis by introducing a mutation to relieve the autoinhibition (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>). UNC-104(1-653)(E412K) eluted in a single peak whose expected molecular weight was that of a dimer. To confirm that the peak shift was due to the conversion from monomer to dimer, we analyzed the main peak fractions from UNC-104(1-653) and UNC-104(1-653)(E412K) by mass photometry. Mass photometry revealed that wild-type UNC-104(1-653) was mostly monomeric (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>, blue), with less than 5% of dimers detected. In contrast, UNC-104(1-653)(E412K) was a mixture of monomers and dimers (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>, orange), with the ratio of monomers and dimers almost 1:1. It is likely that the difference between SEC and mass photometry can be attributed to the concentration disparity between the two techniques; SEC operates in the micromolar range, while mass photometry operates in the nanomolar range, as further discussed later. The prior study showed that UNC-104(1-653) do not show any processive runs on <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> axonemes, which were widely used in the single molecule assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Tomishige et al., 2002</xref>). However, we found wild-type UNC-104(1-653) exhibited a trace number of processive runs on purified brain microtubules but not on <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> axonemes (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D</xref> and S6). Furthermore, UNC-104(1-653)(E412K) very frequently exhibited processive movement on brain microtubules (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5, D-G</xref>). Although the velocity of moving particles did not differ significantly (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5F</xref>), the run length of UNC-104(1-653)(E412K) was much longer than that of wild type UNC-104(1-653) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5G</xref>). These results suggest that the equilibrium between monomers and dimers is shifted towards the dimer form when the autoinhibition of UNC-104 is released. Finally, we confirmed that the difference between UNC-104 and KLP-6 is not due to the effect of different mutations because KLP-6(E409K) did not convert to dimers (Fig. S4 and S7).</p>

<title>The CC2 domain of UNC-104 is essential for the dimerization and processive motility</title>
<p>The sequences of KLP-6(1-587) and UNC-104(1-653) are very similar, except that the CC2 domain of KLP-6 is much shorter than UNC-104 as depicted in Supplementary Figure S3. We analyzed KLP-6(1-587) and UNC-104(1-653) with a coiled-coil prediction algorism called Marcoil (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Delorenzi and Speed, 2002</xref>), which is one of the most reliable prediction algorisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Gruber et al., 2006</xref>). Although the X-ray structure of monomeric KLP-6 has suggested a short α-helix domain is the CC2 domain of KLP-6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Wang et al., 2022</xref>), the probability of coiled-coil formation expected from the Marcoil algorism is very low (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>). On the other hand, the CC2 domain of UNC-104 is expected to be a conventional coiled coil with a high probability (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>). This difference in the structure may contribute to the distinct biochemical properties observed between KLP-6 and UNC-104. To compare the properties of the CC2 domains of KLP-6 and UNC-104, we fused them with a fluorescent protein mScarlet (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref>). We analyzed the purified proteins by SEC (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C</xref>). While the peak of KLP-6CC2-mScarlet was indistinguishable from mScarlet alone, UNC-104CC2-mScarlet exhibited a clear peak shift (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C</xref>). The analysis indicates that UNC-104CC2, but not KLP-6CC2, is capable to induce dimerization.</p>

<p>To further explore the importance of the CC2 domain in the motility of UNC-104, we examined UNC-104(1-594) which consists of the MD, NC, CC1 and FHA domains, but not CC2 (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7A</xref>). In the SEC analysis, both UNC-104(1-594) and UNC-104(1-594)(E412K) showed almost identical profiles (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7B</xref>), which totally differed from the results that UNC-104(1-653)(E412K) shifted towards higher molecular weights compared to UNC-104(1-653) which presents two elution peaks (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>). Mass photometry showed that both UNC-104(1-594) and UNC-104(1-594) (E412K) were predominantly monomeric in solution (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7C</xref>). TIRF microscopy analysis demonstrated that, UNC-104(1-594) rarely showed processive runs on microtubules at the nanomolar range. While UNC-104(1-594) (E412K) displayed some processive runs on microtubules, the run length and landing rate were much lower than those of UNC-104(1-653)(E412K) (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7, D-G</xref>). These results suggest that the CC2 domain is required for the stable dimer formation, activation and processive runs of UNC-104. To confirm the importance of CC2-dependent dimerization in the axonal transport, we proceeded to biochemically analyze a mutation within the CC2 domain of UNC-104. The mutation, UNC-104(L640F), reduces the axonal transport of synaptic materials in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Cong et al., 2021</xref>). This mutation was introduced into UNC −104 (1-653) (E412K). SEC analysis showed that UNC −104 (1-653) (E412K, L640F) predominantly eluted in the monomer peak, even though E412K mitigated autoinhibition and promoted dimerization (Fig. S8). This in vitro result is consistent with abnormal accumulation of synaptic vesicles in <italic>unc-104(L640F)</italic> worms.</p>

<title>Equilibrium between monomers and dimers in UNC-104</title>
<p>Our SEC analysis showed that UNC-104(1-653) was a mixture of dimers and monomers, with monomers predominating (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>). A prior study has observed similar phenomena. UNC-104(1-653) is able to form active dimers at micromolar concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Tomishige et al., 2002</xref>). In contrast, UNC-104(1-653)(E412K) showed a different profile in the SEC analysis, with the majority of the protein recovered from dimer fractions (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>). However in the mass photometry, UNC-104(1-653)(E412K) was a 1:1 mixture of dimers and monomers (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>). This difference could be due to the different concentrations used in the two techniques, with the SEC analysis performed at micromolar concentrations and mass photometry at nanomolar concentrations. These results suggest that (1) UNC-104 exists in an equilibrium between monomers and dimers and (2) the release of the autoinhibition, such as by UNC-104(E412K) mutation, shifts the state of the equilibrium towards the formation of dimers. In contrast, we have not detected KLP-6 dimers in either SEC or mass photometry.</p>

We have previously shown that the E612K mutation in the CC2 domain of UNC-104 disrupt its autoinhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Niwa et al., 2016</xref>). Moreover, crystal structure analysis revealed that the short CC2 domain of KLP-6 is also involved in autoinhibition. In addition to the role in the autoinhibition, CC2 domain is required for the cargo binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Hummel and Hoogenraad, 2021</xref>). We suggest here that, in addition to these functions, CC2 is required for the full activation and processivity of kinesin-3. Because KLP-6 does not have a conserved CC2 domain, KLP-6 cannot form stable dimers (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4, B</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">C</xref>), although KLP-6 needs to be dimerized to obtain processivity (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3, B-E</xref>). A prior work has shown that a deletion mutant of KIF13B composed of MD, NC and CC1 can form a dimer when the autoinhibition is unlocked by mutations, but the major population remains monomeric in the ultracentrifugation analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Ren et al., 2018</xref>). This would be because CC2 is not included in their assays. Indeed, the monomer to dimer conversion was observed upon release of the autoinhibition in the case of the full-length of KIF13B which has the CC2 domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Fan, 2022</xref>). The CC2 domain is conserved in most of the kinesin-3 family proteins including KIF1Bα, KIF1C, KIF13A, KIF16A and KIF16B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Hirokawa et al., 2009</xref>). Taken together, we suggest that the CC2 domain is fundamental to the stable dimer formation in kinesin-3. Moreover, our data suggest that the CC2 domain is required for UNC-104 to move long distances on microtubules (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7, D-G</xref>). Without the CC2 domain, UNC-104 shows only very short runs even if they are activated for microtubule binding. Therefore, the CC2 domain would be essential for long-distance transport, such as axonal transport. Consistent with this idea, the CC2 mutation, unc-104(L640F), which inhibits efficient dimerization of UNC-104 in vitro (Fig S8), reduces the amount of axonal transport in vivo(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Cong et al., 2021</xref>).</p>

<title>Activation of UNC-104 and KLP-6</title>
<p>Neither Tomishige et al. nor we were able to observe any processive runs of wild-type UNC-104(1-653) on <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> axonemes (Fig. S6) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Tomishige et al., 2002</xref>). Moreover, the motility of KIF1A(1-393)LZ was less frequent on <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> axonemes compared with brain microtubules (Fig S6). These observation might be attributed to the extensive post-translational modifications and the presence of microtubule binding proteins on <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> axonemes, which potentially inhibits the motility of kinesins. In contrast, we show that processive movements of UNC-104 can be observed even at nanomolar concentrations when employing purified porcine microtubules as the tracks. Moreover, our study provides compelling evidence that the release of autoinhibition is sufficient for monomeric UNC-104 to dimerize and move processively on microtubules at low nanomolar concentrations. These results revisit previous notion that UNC-104 needs to be enriched to PIP2 microdomains on cargo vesicles to dimerize and move processively (Fig. S9A) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Klopfenstein et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Tomishige et al., 2002</xref>). A recent study has shown that KIF1A, a mammalian ortholog of UNC-104, needs to form a homodimer to bind to cargo vesicles, indicating that KIF1A dimerizes before interacting with cargo vesicles, rather than on cargo vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Hummel and Hoogenraad, 2021</xref>). Based on these findings, we propose that UNC-104 forms dimers in cytosol upon release of autoinhibition, rather than on cargo vesicles, as a prerequisite for motor activation and cargo binding (Fig. S9B). Indeed, the amount of synaptic vesicles transported by UNC-104 is increased by the UNC-104(E412K) mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Niwa et al., 2016</xref>). It is possible that PIP2 microdomains may play a role in stabilizing UNC-104 dimers to ensure long-distance axonal transport because UNC-104 dimers are more stable at higher concentration even when the autoinhibition is unlocked (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5, B</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">C</xref>).</p>
<p>Unlike UNC-104, autoinhibition release is insufficient to induce dimerization of KLP-6. KLP-6 is monomeric in solution even when autoinhibition is unlocked (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). LOV-1 and PKD-2, which form the mechanoreceptor complex transported by KLP-6, stand as potential candidates for an additional regulatory role in KLP-6 dimerization. However, KLP-6 can be activated in Neuro 2a cells when autoinhibition is unlocked (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Wang et al., 2022</xref>), implying that other unidentified factors, including post-translational modifications and binding proteins, may be required for KLP-6 dimerization (Fig. S9C). Our findings imply that mutations disrupting autoinhibition of KLP-6, such as D458A mutation, enhance the intraflagellar transport of LOV-1 and PKD-2 complex in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. Further investigations are needed to fully unravel the molecular mechanisms underlying the dimerization and activation of these motors by identifying factors that can unlock the autoinhibition of UNC-104 and KLP-6 in vitro, as well as factors that induce the dimerization of KLP-6.</p>

<p>The regulation of motor autoinhibition and activation is essential for efficient intracellular transport. This manuscript used biochemical approaches to explore two members in the kinesin-3 family. They found that releasing UNC-104 autoinhibition triggered its dimerization whereas unlocking KLP-6 autoinhibition is insufficient to activate its processive movement, which suggests that KLP-6 requires additional factors for activation, highlighting the common and diverse mechanisms underlying motor activation. They also identified a coiled-coil domain crucial for the dimerization and processive movement of UNC-104. Overall, these biochemical and single-molecule assays were well performed, and their data support their statements. The manuscript is also clearly written, and these results will be valuable to the field.</p>

<p>The Kinesin superfamily motors mediate the transport of a wide variety of cargos which are crucial for cells to develop into unique shapes and polarities. Kinesin-3 subfamily motors are among the most conserved and critical classes of kinesin motors which were shown to be self-inhibited in a monomeric state and dimerize to activate motility along microtubules. Recent studies have shown that different members of this family are uniquely activated by to undergo transition from monomers to dimers.</p>
<p>Niwa and colleagues study two well-described members of the kinesin-3 superfamily, unc104 and KLP6, to uncover the mechanism of monomer to dimer transition upon activation. Their studies reveal that although both Unc104 and KLP6 are both self-inhibited monomers, their propensities for forming dimers are quite different. The authors relate this difference to a region in the molecules called CC2 which has a higher propensity for forming homodimers. Unc104 readily forms homodimers if its self-inhibited state is disabled while KLP6 does not.</p>
<p>The work suggests that although mechanisms for self-inhibited monomeric states are similar, variations in the kinesin-3 dimerization may present a unique forms of kinesin-3 motor regulation with implications on the forms of motility functions carried out by these unique kinesin-3 motors.</p>

<p>In this work, Kita et al., aim to understand the activation mechanisms of the kinesin-3 motors KLP-6 and UNC-104 from C. elegans. As many other motor proteins involved in intracellular transport processes, KLP-6 and UNC-104 motors suppress their ATPase activities in the absence of cargo molecules. Relieving the autoinhibition is thus a crucial step that initiates directional transport of intracellular cargo. To investigate the activation mechanisms, the authors make use of mass photometry to determine the oligomeric states of the full length KLP-6 and the truncated UNC-104(1-653) motors at sub-micromolar concentrations. While full length KLP-6 remains monomeric, the truncated UNC-104(1-653) displays a sub-population of dimeric motors that is much more pronounced at high concentrations, suggesting a monomer-to-dimer conversion. The authors push this equilibrium towards dimeric UNC-104(1-653) motors solely by introducing a point mutation into the coiled-coil domain and ultimately unleash a robust processivity of the UNC-104 dimer. The authors find that the same mechanistic concept does not apply to the KLP-6 kinesin-3 motor, suggesting an alternative activation mechanism of the KLP-6 that remains to be resolved. The present study encourages further dissection of the kinesin-3 motors with the goal of uncovering the main factors needed to overcome the 'self-inflicted' deactivation.</p>

<p>Thank you very much!</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Ideally, the authors can add some in vivo studies to test the physiological relevance of their in vitro findings, given that the lab is very good at worm genetic manipulations. Otherwise, the authors should speculate the in vivo phenotypes in their Discussion, including E412K mutation in UNC-104, CC2 deletion of UNC-104, D458A in KLP-6.</p>
<p>1. We have shown the phenotypes unc-104(E412K) mutation in C. elegans (Niwa et al., Cell Rep, 2016) and described about it in discussion (p.14 line 3-4). The mutant worm showed overactivation of the UNC-104-dependent axonal transport, which is consistent with our biochemical data showing that UNC-104(1-653)(E412K) is prone to form a dimer and more active than wild type.</p>
<p>1. It has been shown that L640F mutation induces a loss of function phenotype in C. elegans (Cong et al., 2021). The amount of axonal transport is reduced in unc-104(L640F) mutant worms. L640 is located within the CC2 domain. To show the importance of CC2-dependent dimerization in the axonal transport in vivo, we biochemically investigated the impact of L640F mutation.</p>
<p>By introducing L640F into UNC-104(1-653)(E412K), we performed SEC analysis. The result shows that UNC-104(1-653)(E412K,L640F) failed to form stable dimers despite the release of their autoinhibition (new Figure S8). This result strongly suggests the importance of the CC2 domain in the axonal transport in vivo. Based on the result, we discussed it in the revised manuscript (p.13 line 6-8).</p>
<p>1. Regarding KLP-6(D458A), we need a genetic analysis using genome editing and we would like to reserve it for a future study. We speculate that the D458A mutation could lead to an increase in transport activity in vivo similar to unc-104(E412K). This is because the previous study have shown that wild-type KLP-6 was largely localized in the cell body, while KLP-6(D458A) was enriched at the cell periphery in the N2A cells (Wang et al., 2022). We described it in discussion (p.14 line 13-14).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>While beyond the scope of this study, can the author speculate on the candidate for an additional regulator to activate KLP-6 in C. elegans?</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The heterodimeric mechanoreceptor complex, comprising LOV-1 and PKD-2, stands as potential candidates for regulating KLP-6 dimerization. We speculate the heterodimerization property is suitable for the enhancement of KLP-6 dimerization. On the other hand, it's noteworthy that KLP-6 can undergo activation in Neuro 2a cells upon the release of autoinhibition (Wang et al., 2022). This observation implies the involvement of additional factors which are not present in sf9 cells may be able to induce dimerization. Post-translational modifications would be one of the candidates. We discussed it in p14 line 7-14.</p>
<p>The authors discussed the differences between their porcine brain MTs and chlamydonomas axonemes in UNC-104 assays. However, the authors did not really retest UNC-104 on axonemes after more than two decades, thereby not excluding other possibilities.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thought that comparing different conditions used in different studies is essential for the advancement of the field of molecular motors. Therefore, we newly performed single-molecule assay using Chlamydomonas axonemes and compared the results with brain MTs (Fig. S6). Just as observed in the study by Tomoshige et al., we were also unable to observe the processive runs of UNC-104(1-653) on Chlamydomonas axonemes (Fig. S6A). Furthermore, we found that the landing rate of UNC-104(1-653) on Chlamydomonas axonemes was markedly lower in comparison to that on purified porcine microtubules (Fig. S6B).</p>

<p>The work suggests that although mechanisms for self-inhibited monomeric states are similar, variations in the kinesin-3 dimerization may present a unique form of kinesin-3 motor regulation with implications on the forms of motility functions carried out by these unique kinesin-3 motors.</p>

<p>The work is interesting but the process of making constructs and following the transition from monomers to dimers seems to be less than logical and haphazard. Recent crystallographic studies for kinesin-3 have shown the fold and interactions for all domains of the motor leading to the self-inhibited state. The mutations described in the manuscript leading to disabling of the monomeric self-inhibited state are referenced but not logically explained in relation to the structures. Many of the deletion constructs could also present other defects that are not presented in the mutations. The above issues prevent wide audience access to understanding the studies carried out by the authors.</p>

<p>We appreciate this comment. We improved it as described bellow.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Suggestions: Authors should present schematic, or structural models for the self-inhibited and dimerized states. The conclusions of the papers should be related to those models. The mutations should be explained with regard to these models and that would allow the readers easier access. Improving access to the readers in and outside the motor field would truly improve the impact of the manuscript on the field.</p>

<p>The structural models illustrating the autoinhibited state have been included in new Figure S4, accompanied by an explanation of the correlation between the mutations and these structures in the figure legend. Additionally, schematic models outlining the dimerization process of both UNC-104 and KLP-6 have been provided in Figure S9 to enhance reader comprehension of the process.</p>

<p>In this work, Kita et al., aim to understand the activation mechanisms of the kinesin-3 motors KLP-6 and UNC-104 from C. elegans. As with many other motor proteins involved in intracellular transport processes, KLP-6 and UNC-104 motors suppress their ATPase activities in the absence of cargo molecules. Relieving the autoinhibition is thus a crucial step that initiates the directional transport of intracellular cargo. To investigate the activation mechanisms, the authors make use of mass photometry to determine the oligomeric states of the full-length KLP-6 and the truncated UNC-104(1-653) motors at sub-micromolar concentrations. While full-length KLP-6 remains monomeric, the truncated UNC-104(1-653) displays a sub-population of dimeric motors that is much more pronounced at high concentrations, suggesting a monomer-to-dimer conversion. The authors push this equilibrium towards dimeric UNC-104(1-653) motors solely by introducing a point mutation into the coiled-coil domain and ultimately unleashing a robust processivity of the UNC-104 dimer. The authors find that the same mechanistic concept does not apply to the KLP-6 kinesin-3 motor, suggesting an alternative activation mechanism of the KLP-6 that remains to be resolved. The present study encourages further dissection of the kinesin-3 motors with the goal of uncovering the main factors needed to overcome the 'self-inflicted' deactivation.</p>

<p>126-128: It is surprising that surface-attachment does not really activate the full-length KLP6 motor (v=48 {plus minus} 42 nm/s). Can the authors provide an example movie of the gliding assay for the FL KLP6 construct? Gliding assays are done by attaching motors via their sfGFP to the surface using anti-GFP antibodies. Did the authors try to attach the full-length KLP-6 motor directly to the surface? If the KLP-6 motor sticks to the surface via its (inhibitory) C-terminus, this attachment would be expected to activate the motor in the gliding assay, ideally approaching the in vivo velocities of the activated motor.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have included an example kymograph showing the gliding assay of KLP-6FL (Fig. S1A). When we directly attached KLP-6FL to the surface, the velocity was 0.15 ± 0.02 µm/sec (Fig. S1B), which is similar to the velocity of KLP-6(1-390). While the velocity observed in the direct-attachment condition is much better than those observed in GFP-mediated condition, the observed velocity remains considerably slower than in vivo velocities. Firstly, we think this is because dimerization of KLP-6 is not induced by the surface attachment. Previous studies have shown that monomeric proteins are generally slower than dimeric proteins in the gliding assay (Tomishige et al., 2002). These are consistent with our observation that KLP-6 remains to be monomeric even when autoinhibition is released. Secondly, in vitro velocity of motors is generally slower than in vivo velocity.</p>

<p>156-157: It seems that the GCN4-mediated dimerization induces aggregation of the KLP6 motor domains as seen in the fractions under the void volume in Figure 3B (not seen with the Sf9 expressed full-length constructs, see Figure 1B). Also, the artificially dimerized motor construct does not fully recapitulate the in vivo velocity of UNC-104. Did the authors analyze the KLP-6(1-390)LZ with mass photometry and is it the only construct that is expressed in E. coli?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>KLP-6::LZ protein is not aggregating. We have noticed that DNA and RNA from E. coli exists in the void fraction and they occasionally trap recombinant kinesin-3 proteins in the void fraction. To effectively remove these nucleic acids from our protein samples, we employed streptomycin sulfate as a purification method (Liang et al., Electrophoresis, 2009). Please see Purification of recombinant proteins in Methods. In the size exclusion chromatography analysis, we observed that KLP-6(1-393)LZ predominantly eluted in the dimer fraction (New Figure 3). Subsequently, we reanalyzed the motor's motility using a total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) assay, as shown in the revised Figure 3. Even after these efforts, the velocity was not changed significantly.
The velocity of KLP-6LZ is about 0.3 µm/sec while that of cellular KLP-6::GFP is 0.7 µm/sec (Morsci and Barr, 2011). Similar phenomena, &quot;slower velocity in vitro&quot;, has been observed in other motor proteins.</p>

<p>169: In Wang et al., (2022) the microtubule-activated ATPase activities of the mutants were measured in vitro as well, with the relative activities of the motor domain and the D458A mutant being very similar. The D458A mutation is introduced into the full-length motor in Wang et al., while in the present work, the mutation is introduced into the truncated KLP-6(1-587) construct. Can the authors explain their reasoning for the latter?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>(1) Kinesins are microtubule-stimulated ATPases. i.e. The ATPase activity is induced by the binding with a microtubule.</p>
<p>(2) Previous studies have shown that the one-dimensional movement of the monomeric motor domain of kinesin-3 depends on the ATPase activity even when the movement does not show clear plus-end directionality (Okada et al., Science, 1998).</p>
<p>(3) While KLP-6(1-587) does not bind to microtubules, both KLP-6(1-390) (= the monomeric motor domain) and KLP-6(1-587)(D458A) similarly bind to microtubules and show one dimensional diffusion on microtubules (Fig. 4E and S2B).</p>
<p>Therefore, the similar ATPase activities of the motor domain(= KLP-6(1-390)) and KLP-6(D458A) observed by Wang et al. is because both proteins similarly associate with and hydrolyze ATP on microtubules, which is consistent with our observation. On the other hand, because KLP-6(wild type) cannot efficiently bind to microtubules, the ATPase activity is low.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Can the authors compare the gliding velocities of the KLP-6(1-390)LZ vs KLP-6(1-587) vs KLP-6(1-587)(D458A) constructs to make sure that the motors are similarly active?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We conducted a comparative analysis of gliding velocities involving KLP-6(1-390), KLP-6(1-587), and KLP-6(1-587)(D458A) (Fig. S1C). We used KLP-6(1-390) instead of KLP-6(1-390)LZ, aligning with the protein used by Wang et al.. We demonstrated that both KLP-6(1-587) and KLP-6(1-587) (D458A) exhibited activity levels comparable to that of KLP-6(1-390). The data suggests that the motor of all recombinant proteins are similarly active.</p>
<p>Please note that, unlike full length condition (Fig. 1D and S1A and S1B), the attachment to the surface using the anti-GFP antibody can activates KLP-6(1-587). The data suggests that, due to the absence of coverage by the MBS and MATH domain (Wang et al., Nat. Commun., 2022), the motor domain of KLP-6(1-587) to some extent permits direct binding to microtubules under gliding assay conditions.</p>

<p>Are the monomeric and dimeric UNC-104(1-653) fractions in Figure 5B in equilibrium? Did the authors do a re-run of the second peak of UNC-104(1-653) (i.e. the monomeric fraction with ~100 kDa) to assess if the monomeric fraction re-equilibrates into a dimer-monomer distribution?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We conducted a re-run of the second peak of UNC-104(1-653) and verified its re-equilibration into a distribution of dimers and monomers after being incubated for 72 hours at 4°C (Fig. S5).</p>

<p>UNC-104 appears to have another predicted coiled-coiled region around ~800 aa (e.g. by NCoils) that would correspond to the CC3 in the mammalian homolog KIF1A. This raises the question if the elongated UNC-104(1-800) would dimerize more efficiently than UNC-104(1-653) (authors highlight the sub-population of dimerized UNC-104(1-653) at low concentrations in Figure 5C) and if this dimerization alone would suffice to 'match' the UNC-104(1-653)E412K mutant (Figure 5D). Did the authors explore this possibility? This would mean that dimerization does not necessarily require the release of autoinhibition.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have tried to purify UNC-104(1-800) and full-length UNC-104 using the baculovirus system. However, unfortunately, the expression level of UNC-104(1-800) and full length UNC-104 was too low to perform in vitro assays even though codon optimized vectors were used. Instead, we have analyzed full-length human KIF1A. We found that full-length KIF1A is mostly monomeric, not dimeric (Please look at the Author response image 1). The property is similar to UNC-104(1-653) (Figure 5A-C). Therefore, we think CC3 does not strongly affect dimerization of KIF1A, and probably its ortholog UNC-104. Moreover, a recent study has shown that CC2 domain, but not other CC domains, form a stable dimer in the case of KIF1A (Hummel and Hoogenraad, JCB, 2021). Given the similarity in the sequence of KIF1A and UNC-104, we anticipate that the CC2 domain of UNC-104 significantly contributes to dimerization, potentially more than other CC domains. We explicitly describe it in the Discussion in the revised manuscript.</p>
