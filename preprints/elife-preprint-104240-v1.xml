<title>Abstract</title><p>The obligate intracellular bacterium <italic>Chlamydia</italic> alternates between two functional forms during its developmental cycle: elementary body (EB) and reticulate body (RB). However, the molecular mechanisms governing the transitions between these forms are unknown. Here, we present evidence cyclic di-AMP (c-di-AMP) is a key factor in triggering the transition from RB to EB (i.e., secondary differentiation) in the chlamydial developmental cycle. By overexpressing or knocking down expression of c-di-AMP synthase genes, we made strains producing different levels of c-di-AMP, which we linked to changes in secondary differentiation status. Increases in c-di-AMP resulted in an earlier increase in transcription of EB-associated genes, and this was further manifested in earlier production of EBs. In contrast, when c-di-AMP levels were decreased, secondary differentiation was delayed. Based on these data, we conclude there is a threshold level of c-di-AMP needed to trigger secondary differentiation in <italic>Chlamydia</italic>. This is the first study to identify a mechanism by which secondary differentiation is initiated in <italic>Chlamydia</italic> and reveals a critical role for the second messenger signaling molecule c-di-AMP in this process.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p><italic>Chlamydia</italic> species are major pathogens of humans and animals. These obligate intracellular bacteria share one key feature: their unique developmental cycle (See ref.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>)). During this cycle, <italic>Chlamydia</italic> transitions between two different functional and morphological forms: the elementary body (EB), an infectious but non-dividing cell, and the reticulate body (RB), a dividing but non-infectious cell (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). A third form, the intermediate body (IB) is a transitional form from the RB to EB. Besides these characteristics, EBs and RBs differ in other ways. For example, EBs are small (∼0.3 μm), have a highly disulfide-crosslinked outer membrane(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>) and have DNA condensed by histone-like proteins(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>). In contrast, RBs are larger (∼1 μm), have a Gram-negative cell envelope that lacks peptidoglycan(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>), and have a dispersed chromosome. RBs divide by an asymmetric polarized division mechanism dependent on MreB-directed peptidoglycan synthesis specifically at the septum(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>). Not surprisingly, <italic>Chlamydia</italic> expresses genes in a temporally defined manner that correspond broadly with its developmental cycle(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>). “Early” genes (e.g., <italic>euo</italic>) are expressed immediately upon entry into a target host cell and are likely involved in establishing the intracellular niche of <italic>Chlamydia</italic>, the inclusion, and mediating primary differentiation from EB to RB. “Mid” cycle genes (e.g., <italic>mreB, clpPX</italic>) facilitate RB replication and division and inclusion growth. “Late” genes (e.g., <italic>omcB</italic>) are expressed when secondary differentiation is initiated to trigger EB formation. Although developmental gene expression has been characterized for decades, the signals or events that initiate differentiation from one form to the other are not known.</p>

<p>In a 2013 study, another defining characteristic of EBs and RBs was identified: their relative levels of the second messenger signaling molecule cyclic di-AMP (c-di-AMP) (See ref. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>)). Barker et al. studied how IFNβ production is activated in cells infected with <italic>C. trachomatis</italic>. The authors identified a role for the innate immune response protein, STING, which recognizes c-di-AMP. <italic>Chlamydia</italic> encodes a diadenylate cyclase enzyme, DacA, associated with c-di-AMP production, that had not been characterized. As part of their study, the authors determined that c-di-AMP accumulates over the course of the chlamydial developmental cycle, that EBs have high levels of this molecule whereas RBs have low levels, and that DacA is a diadenylate cyclase. It is unlikely that <italic>Chlamydia</italic> produces c-di-AMP only to signal host immune responses. Rather, the parsimonious interpretation is that <italic>Chlamydia</italic> uses this signaling molecule to regulate some aspect of its physiology and that activation of host signaling is “accidental” – similar to activation of NOD2 by chlamydial peptidoglycan(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>). However, no direct function of c-di-AMP in chlamydial biology has been defined.</p>
<p>Diverse functions of c-di-AMP have been reported in Gram-positive bacteria. For example, c-di-AMP is implicated in the response to changes in osmotic pressure. When the extracellular solute level is high, bacteria prevent dehydration by importing both extracellular solute molecules and cations(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>). In these mechanisms, c-di-AMP binds to proteins associated with K<sup>+</sup> uptake systems such as Ktr/Trk, KimA, Kup, and Kdp and inhibits their activities in <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic>, <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, and <italic>Lactococcus lactis</italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>). Similarly, K<sup>+</sup> export mechanisms are also regulated by c-di-AMP. In <italic>S. aureus</italic>, the cation/proton antiporter A (CpaA) is activated by binding c-di-AMP(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>). Moreover, c-di-AMP binds to the riboswitch upstream of the genes encoding the K<sup>+</sup> transporters and controls their transcriptional levels(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>). With these mechanisms, osmotic stress is controlled by c-di-AMP. Of note, <italic>Chlamydia</italic> lacks annotated orthologs of K<sup>+</sup> transporters. In addition to osmotic homeostasis, c-di-AMP has been reported to affect DNA replication and sporulation(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>). When DNA damage is detected, DisA, a diadenylate cyclase, forms a DNA repair complex with RecA and RadA, resulting in inhibition of diadenylate cyclase activity in <italic>B. subtilis</italic>. Subsequently, c-di-AMP levels decrease, and DNA replication and sporulation are arrested(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>).</p>
<p>Given the differences in c-di-AMP levels between EBs and RBs and its function as a diffusible second messenger signaling molecule, we hypothesized that the accumulation of c-di-AMP during the developmental cycle might be a trigger for secondary differentiation in <italic>Chlamydia</italic> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>). Once a threshold concentration of c-di-AMP has been reached in a given RB, it will begin the differentiation process to an EB. We predicted that, if our hypothesis were correct, then we should be able to alter the levels of c-di-AMP in the organism and affect its differentiation status accordingly. For example, if we increase c-di-AMP production, then we anticipate prematurely triggering EB production. Conversely, if we prevent c-di-AMP production, then we anticipate delaying EB production.</p>
<p>There are three principal mechanisms to regulate c-di-AMP levels: through synthesis by diadenylate cyclase, through degradation by a phosphodiesterase (PDE), and through secretion by a transporter(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>). Interestingly, <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> only encodes the synthesis mechanism as it possesses the genes for diadenylate cyclase (<italic>dacA</italic>) and its regulator (<italic>ybbR</italic>) within a bicistronic operon, but no annotated PDEs or c-di-AMP transporters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>). Therefore, to test our hypothesis, we genetically manipulated the levels of DacA and/or YbbR using recently developed strategies in the field. In the present study, we characterized the growth and developmental cycle state of chlamydial strains producing high or low levels of c-di-AMP. Our data show that higher levels of c-di-AMP are directly linked to increased transcript levels of late genes associated with secondary differentiation as well as the concomitant production of EBs at an earlier stage in the developmental cycle. In contrast, in cells with reduced c-di-AMP levels, the developmental cycle was significantly delayed. Based on these data, we conclude that there is a threshold level of c-di-AMP necessary to trigger secondary differentiation in <italic>C. trachomatis</italic>. This is the first study to identify a physiological function for c-di-AMP in <italic>Chlamydia</italic> as well as a mechanism by which secondary differentiation is initiated in these unique bacteria.</p>

<title>Both DacA and YbbR are crucial for cyclic di-AMP synthesis in <italic>C. trachomatis</italic></title>
<p>To test the link between c-di-AMP levels and chlamydial developmental cycle progression, we made a collection of <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> strains carrying anhydrotetracycline (aTc)-inducible constructs (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>). These included strains to overexpress DacA_6xH, YbbR_6xH, both DacA and YbbR_6xH (<italic>dacA</italic>op), or both the catalytically dead DacA(D164N) and YbbR_6xH (<italic>dacA</italic>opMut). As a control for overexpression, we used a strain carrying the same plasmid backbone with aTc-inducible mCherry. For all of these overexpression strains, we emphasize that the chromosomal expression of wild-type <italic>dacA</italic> and <italic>ybbR</italic> is maintained. In addition to the overexpression constructs, we also made a conditional knockdown construct for <italic>dacA</italic> (<italic>dacA</italic>-KD), targeting its promoter region, to decrease the expression of <italic>dacA-ybbR</italic> using a dCas12/crRNA-based system that our group developed for <italic>Chlamydia</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>). Finally, we made a complementation construct for <italic>dacA</italic>-KD by introducing <italic>dacA-ybbR</italic>_6xH (<italic>dacA</italic>-KDcom) 3’ to dCas12 such that induction of dCas12 results in the coexpression of DacA and YbbR_6xH as well during knockdown of endogenous <italic>dacA-ybbR</italic>.</p>
<p>Each of the transformant strains were used to infect HeLa cells at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1 and subsequently induced or not with 5 nM aTc at 10 hours post-infection (hpi). We collected cell lysates at 16 and 24 hpi and measured c-di-AMP levels by ELISA (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>). The former timepoint is characterized by predominantly an RB population whereas the latter timepoint is characterized by ongoing secondary differentiation and a mixture of RBs, IBs, and EBs. We initially assessed the “empty vector” mCherry expressing control strain for its c-di-AMP levels and observed that c-di-AMP levels were significantly higher at 24hpi compared to 16hpi (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>), in agreement with the Barker et al. study indicating higher levels of c-di-AMP in EBs(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>). As expected, only basal amounts of c-di-AMP were detected in uninfected HeLa cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>).</p>
<p>Interestingly, c-di-AMP levels were comparable between the vector control strain and the DacA_6xH or YbbR_6xH overexpression strains, implying that expression of either alone does not alter endogenous c-di-AMP levels. However, when DacA and YbbR_6xH were co-overexpressed, c-di-AMP levels increased by approximately 30-fold at 16 hpi and 120-fold at 24 hpi compared to that of the control strain (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>). These data suggest that, in <italic>Chlamydia</italic>, DacA activity requires YbbR for efficient c-di-AMP production. Of note, the levels of c-di-AMP at 16hpi in the <italic>dacA</italic>op strain were higher even than the control strain at 24hpi. To confirm whether DacA enzyme activity is critical for the high levels of c-di-AMP in the <italic>dacA</italic>op strain, we substituted the catalytic residue of DacA with a mutation to render it inactive (D164N)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>). When DacA(D164N) and YbbR_6xH were co-overexpressed (<italic>dacA</italic>opMut), c-di-AMP levels were reduced compared to the control and did not increase between 16 and 24hpi, suggesting that c-di-AMP synthase activity was blocked in this strain. For the <italic>dacA</italic>-KD strain, the c-di-AMP level decreased about 1.2 fold at 16 hpi and ∼10 fold at 24 hpi. The loss of c-di-AMP production in this strain was restored in the complemented <italic>dacA</italic>-KD_<italic>dacA</italic>op strain, which showed a phenotype similar to the <italic>dacA</italic>op overexpression strain. Based on these data, we conclude that both DacA and YbbR are crucial for c-di-AMP synthesis in <italic>Chlamydia</italic>. Importantly, our collection of strains that are high or low producers of c-di-AMP give us an opportunity to test our overarching hypothesis (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>).</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<title>Overexpression of DacA isoforms, but not YbbR, is detrimental to the chlamydial developmental cycle</title>
<p>DacA and YbbR are both predicted to contain transmembrane domains (3 for DacA and 1 for YbbR)(Fig. S1, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>)). To observe the localization of DacA and YbbR, we infected HeLa cells with transformants encoding <italic>dacA</italic>_6xH or <italic>ybbR</italic>_6xH alone and induced expression of the constructs at 10 hpi with 5 nM aTc. At 24 hpi, infected cells were fixed, and we performed an indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA) by labeling the major outer membrane protein (MOMP) and 6xH. We observed that both DacA and YbbR localize at the membrane as expected (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">E</xref>). Interestingly, when DacA_6xH was overexpressed, the inclusion size appeared qualitatively reduced in size with apparently larger individual organisms than those in the uninduced control. This suggests that overexpressing DacA_6xH alone may negatively impact chlamydial replication.</p>

</fig>
<p>To investigate this in more detail, we measured EB progeny production using an inclusion forming unit (IFU) assay and genomic DNA levels (a proxy for total bacteria, i.e., EB+RB) by qPCR. To quantify IFUs, a lysate from a primary infection is prepared and used to infect a fresh monolayer of cells. Any inclusions in the secondary infection are derived from an EB present in the primary infection.</p>
<p>The vector control strain showed no differences in IFUs when overexpressing mCherry (Fig. S2). At 24 hpi, both IFUs and genomic DNA levels were significantly decreased in the DacA_6xH overexpression strain compared to that of the uninduced control (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">C</xref>), indicating DacA_6xH overexpression disrupts developmental cycle progression. Based on these data, we conclude overexpressed DacA_6xH is detrimental to the chlamydial developmental cycle progression even though it does not impact overall c-di-AMP production (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>). To further investigate this, we quantified transcripts by RT-qPCR for a canonical early-cycle gene, <italic>euo</italic>, and two late-cycle genes, <italic>hctA</italic> (an “early” late gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>)) and <italic>omcB</italic> (a canonical late gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>)). Consistent with the gDNA and IFU data, overexpression of DacA_6xH resulted in elevated <italic>euo</italic> transcripts and a reduction in the amounts of the late gene transcripts at 24hpi (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>). We obtained similar results when overexpressing wild-type DacA without a 6xHis tag, indicating these effects are not linked to the tag (Fig. S3). We also performed similar experiments with the inactive isoform of DacA, DacA(D164N)_6xH. Like overexpression of the wild-type DacA_6xH, overexpression of DacA(D164N)_6xH also negatively affected IFU production while reducing c-di-AMP levels (Fig. S4), similar to the dacAopMut strain (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>).</p>
<p>We next measured the effect of YbbR_6xH overexpression on the developmental cycle using the same parameters. Unlike DacA_6xH, we measured no difference between uninduced and induced samples for genomic DNA level, indicating no impact of YbbR_6xH overexpression on RB replication or total bacterial numbers (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2G</xref>). YbbR_6xH overexpression did result in a statistically significant, ∼2-fold decrease in EB production (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2F</xref>). This reflects one division cycle difference from the uninduced control and, in the absence of any other phenotypic discrepancy, is not considered biologically relevant. This was further supported by the absence of any effect of YbbR_6xH overexpression on transcript levels for <italic>euo</italic>, <italic>hctA</italic>, or <italic>omcB</italic> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2H</xref>). Therefore, we conclude YbbR_6xH overexpression alone does not affect the chlamydial developmental cycle.</p>

<title>A low level of c-di-AMP decreases the transcript levels of late genes</title>
<p>As mentioned above, the <italic>dacA</italic>-KD strain displayed a lower c-di-AMP level compared to that of the control strain at 24 hpi (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>). To observe effects of knockdown on the developmental cycle, we examined if there were qualitative defects in inclusion or bacterial morphology by IFA. When the knockdown system was induced, bacterial cell size appeared somewhat enlarged, and we observed the inclusion size appeared smaller compared to that of the uninduced control (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). In addition, we also measured the amount of EB progeny (IFUs) and genomic DNA. Although genomic DNA levels were the same, IFUs decreased by approximately 80% compared to that of the uninduced sample at 24 hpi (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">C</xref>). Based on these data, we conclude that low levels of c-di-AMP are detrimental for secondary differentiation. To further explore this, we performed RT-qPCR to quantify transcripts of relevant gene targets. When dCas12 was induced, both <italic>dacA</italic> and <italic>ybbR</italic> transcript levels decreased (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>). Since <italic>dacA</italic> and <italic>ybbR</italic> are transcribed in an operon, this result is not surprising. Consistent with reduced EB yields, transcripts of the late genes <italic>omcB</italic> and <italic>hctA</italic> were decreased at 24 hpi. In contrast, transcripts of the early gene <italic>euo</italic> were slightly elevated at 24 hpi. We have previously observed no effects on gDNA levels or transcription of these genes when overexpressing the dCas12 gene alone(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>), indicating these effects are specific to <italic>dacA</italic>-KD. These data support the conclusion that reducing the levels of c-di-AMP delays developmental cycle progression.</p>

<p>We next tested whether the <italic>dacA</italic>-KD strain’s phenotype is complemented by ectopic expression of <italic>dacA-ybbR_6xH</italic> (<italic>dacA-</italic>KDcom) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>). This construct encodes not only the <italic>dacA</italic>-knockdown system but also the <italic>dacA-ybbR_6xH</italic> operon as a transcriptional fusion with dCas12. Induction of dCas12 and YbbR_6xH was confirmed by IFA under inducing conditions (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E</xref>). We expected that co-expressing DacA and YbbR_6xH would complement the phenotype of <italic>dacA</italic>-KD. However, the inclusion and bacterial size phenotypes were not fully restored to the uninduced control. We then measured gDNA levels and IFUs and observed that the complemented strain showed an approximate 2-fold reduction in both gDNA and EBs at 24 hpi (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3F</xref>&amp;<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">G</xref>). We next measured transcript levels as described previously. Both <italic>dacA</italic> and <italic>ybbR</italic> transcripts were increased compared to the <italic>dacA</italic>-KD strain (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3H</xref>), and transcript levels for these genes were increased beyond the “wild-type” uninduced control levels, suggesting that the complemented strain is more similar to the <italic>dacA</italic>op strain (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>). Nonetheless, transcripts for the early gene <italic>euo</italic> were identical to those in the uninduced strain (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3H</xref>).

Based on these unusual findings of elevated late gene transcripts earlier in the developmental cycle, we conclude that overexpressed DacA and YbbR_6xH may alter the timing of secondary differentiation.</p>

<title>High levels of c-di-AMP induce late gene expression</title>
<p>To clarify the effect of DacA and YbbR_6xH overexpression on secondary differentiation, we next evaluated the phenotype of the <italic>dacA</italic>op strain. When we induced expression of this construct, we confirmed the induction of DacA and YbbR_6xH and their colocalization at the membrane (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>; Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.713 ± 0.109 from 20 inclusions measured by JACoP Plugin of ImageJ; values near 1 indicate colocalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>)). This is not surprising as both proteins are critical for c-di-AMP synthesis based on our c-di-AMP measurements (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>). Organism and inclusion morphology was similar to the <italic>dacA</italic>-KDcom complemented strain. We next assessed whether the overexpressed DacA and YbbR_6xH affected replication by measuring gDNA levels. Again, the gDNA data closely phenocopied the complemented knockdown strain, showing a decrease at 24 hpi (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>). We then quantified transcripts for the developmentally regulated genes <italic>euo</italic>, <italic>hctA</italic>, and <italic>omcB</italic> as well as for <italic>dacA</italic> and <italic>ybbR</italic> (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>). Not surprisingly, <italic>dacA</italic> and <italic>ybbR</italic> transcripts were elevated at the timepoints assessed. Transcripts for <italic>euo</italic> were not statistically changed but trended higher at the 24 hpi timepoint whereas <italic>omcB</italic> transcripts were slightly, but not significantly, increased at 14 and 24 hpi. Once again, we observed that <italic>hctA</italic> transcripts were increased over 10-fold at 14hpi in the developmental cycle (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>), similar to what we measured for the complemented knockdown strain (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3H</xref>). These data reinforce that elevated c-di-AMP levels (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>) in these strains lead to increased expression of the “early” late gene <italic>hctA</italic> at an earlier timepoint (14 hpi) in the developmental cycle.</p>

<p>To confirm whether these phenotypes are caused by a higher level of c-di-AMP, we compared our results for the <italic>dacA</italic>op strain to the <italic>dacA</italic>opMut strain, in which the active site residue of DacA has been mutated. The c-di-AMP levels in this strain remain low (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>). The bacterial morphology indicated slightly larger organisms without an effect on overall inclusion size (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref>). Genomic DNA levels showed a significant drop at 24 hpi (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E</xref>).

The transcriptional results of the developmentally regulated genes in the <italic>dacA</italic>opMut strain were very similar to the <italic>dacA</italic>-KD strain (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>).

<title>Elevated c-di-AMP increases transcript levels of genes necessary for secondary differentiation</title>
<p>Given the surprising finding that, in strains overproducing c-di-AMP, <italic>hctA</italic> transcripts were 10-fold higher at a timepoint not associated with secondary differentiation, we asked the question whether <italic>all</italic> genes related to secondary differentiation were increased after inducing production of c-di-AMP. Conversely, we wanted to explore whether reducing c-di-AMP levels would delay expression of genes related to secondary differentiation. Thus, to further investigate how c-di-AMP affects transcription of such genes, we performed RNA sequencing on both the <italic>dacA</italic>op overexpression and <italic>dacA</italic>-KD strains and compared the transcriptome between uninduced and induced samples within the given strain at the given timepoint. HeLa cells were infected with these transformants, and overexpression or knockdown was induced or not at 10 hpi with 5 nM aTc. For the <italic>dacA</italic>op strain, RNA was collected at 16 hpi, a time at which late genes are beginning to be expressed (as opposed to 14hpi) but remain near a basal level of transcription(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>). The rationale for this was to determine whether high c-di-AMP levels result in increased late gene transcripts at this timepoint <italic>above and beyond</italic> the levels of the control, uninduced condition. For the <italic>dacA</italic>-KD strain, RNA was collected at 24 hpi, a time at which late genes are peaking in their expression. The rationale for this was to determine whether late gene transcription was decreased, which could not otherwise be assessed at the 16 hpi timepoint.</p>
<p>RNA sequencing results were statistically analyzed by the UNMC Bioinformatics Core (Table S2&amp;3). <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref> shows a volcano plot of the results for the <italic>dacA</italic>op overexpression and <italic>dacA</italic>-KD strains. Of note, many late genes were evident in the upregulated quadrant for the <italic>dacAop</italic> strain whereas the opposite was true for the <italic>dacA</italic>-KD strain. We further characterized the upregulated or downregulated gene sets for the <italic>dacA</italic>op overexpression and <italic>dacA</italic>-KD strains, respectively, based on significant difference (p&lt;0.05) and fold-change (&gt;1.5). A summary of these results is presented in <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> (all data are presented in Table S3). We grouped the differentially expressed genes into five categories: 1) canonical late genes for which the literature has associated them with EB function, 2) outer membrane associated, 3) gene regulation associated, 4) glycogen synthesis associated, and 5) type III secretion system associated. Recent work from our group and the Hefty group to define the regulons of the alternative sigma factors in <italic>Chlamydia</italic> demonstrated that these sigma factors regulate some late gene expression associated with outer membrane remodeling, type III secretion, and other processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>). Consistent with our RT-qPCR data, we observed that all canonical late genes as well as all the other genes listed in these categories showed an increase in expression after c-di-AMP production was induced. In contrast, all the genes, and particularly the canonical late genes, showed a decrease in expression under conditions where c-di-AMP production was impaired. Overall, these RNA sequencing data confirm the direct influence of c-di-AMP on expression of genes related to secondary differentiation.</p>

<title>Increased c-di-AMP production activates late gene transcription during penicillin treatment</title>
<p>We next asked whether late gene transcripts could be increased by elevated c-di-AMP levels even under conditions when developmental progression is blocked. Penicillin treatment of <italic>Chlamydia</italic> blocks cell division and results in aberrantly enlarged RBs that fail to activate late gene transcription with a concomitant reduction in EB progeny production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>). As our previously described <italic>dacA</italic>op overexpression strain was constructed in a beta-lactamase producing background, we first generated a spectinomycin-resistant <italic>dacA</italic>op overexpression strain and validated that induction of the <italic>dacA</italic> operon resulted in earlier accumulation of <italic>hctA</italic> transcripts (Fig. S5). We next used this strain to infect cells and induced overexpression or not with 5 nM aTc at 10 hpi. We also treated cells with 1 U/mL penicillin at this timepoint. Penicillin treatment resulted in aberrantly enlarged RBs, as expected (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>). However, we did observe that overexpressing <italic>dacA</italic>op in the presence of penicillin negatively impacted overall inclusion size as compared to the uninduced but penicillin-treated condition. Genomic DNA levels similarly were decreased at 24hpi as compared to the uninduced control (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref>). Transcripts for <italic>dacA</italic> and <italic>ybbR</italic> were increased after inducing their expression, and <italic>euo</italic> transcripts remained elevated at 24hpi under these conditions. Interestingly, <italic>hctA</italic> transcripts in the uninduced but penicillin-treated cultures were low at 14 hpi but increased ∼5-fold by 24 hpi whereas <italic>omcB</italic> transcripts remained at a basal level at all timepoints under these conditions (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C</xref>).

<title>Alterations in c-di-AMP levels impact the timing of EB production</title>
<p>The phenotypic effect of increased late gene transcription should be an increase in EB production. However, if EB production is initiated at an earlier time in the developmental cycle when there are fewer non-infectious RBs to convert, then overall EB production should be decreased with a concomitant decrease in gDNA levels since only the RB replicates DNA. Conversely, delayed expression of late genes should be associated with a delay in EB production. Therefore, to test these predictions, we quantified EB production at 2h intervals from 18 to 24hpi to assess EB production during earlier phases of the developmental cycle, as well as at 32 and 48hpi to assess overall EB yields (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>). We did not detect any EBs at 16hpi or earlier (not shown). Cells were infected with the <italic>dacA</italic>op, <italic>dacA</italic>opMut, and <italic>dacA</italic>-KD strains and induced or not at 10 hpi with 5 nM aTc as previously noted. Consistent with the transcriptional data, we measured higher EB yields at 18 and 20 hpi during <italic>dacA</italic>op overexpression that quickly plateaued by 24 hpi (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7A</xref>). Conversely, when c-di-AMP accumulation was blocked by reducing the expression of DacA and YbbR (<italic>dacA</italic>-KD), we observed delayed EB production (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7B</xref>). We also measured lower EB yields when c-di-AMP levels were decreased by overexpression of the DacA(D164N) isoform and YbbR (<italic>dacA</italic>opMut; <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7C</xref>). The uninduced control conditions for each strain showed a steady accumulation of EBs throughout the course of the experiment, as expected. The vector control strain expressing mCherry showed no differences (Fig. S2). From these data, we conclude that earlier production of c-di-AMP levels results in earlier production of EBs.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Secondary differentiation is essential for the propagation and survival of <italic>Chlamydia</italic> species. However, the mechanisms governing this essential process are largely unknown. It is possible that both internal and external environmental changes might serve as signals to trigger the shift from the non-infectious RB to the infectious EB. It is also possible, and even likely, that <italic>Chlamydia</italic> integrates multiple signal inputs during the differentiation process. However, as secondary differentiation is asynchronous, any mechanism must account for the stochasticity within the population of RBs “considering” differentiating to EBs. Here, we provide the first evidence of a signal that can directly activate EB-associated gene expression with a concomitant early production of EBs.</p>
<p>Several reports have proposed mechanisms by which <italic>Chlamydia</italic> triggers secondary differentiation. For example, Thompson et al. investigated the non-canonical regulation of the major sigma factor, σ<sup>66</sup>, by the Rsb phosphoregulatory system(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>). The authors provided evidence that altering the levels of RsbW or RsbV1 impacted the expression of σ<sup>66</sup>-controlled genes. This led them to propose a model whereby sensing of ATP by the Rsb system controls the availability of σ<sup>66</sup>, implying that low levels of ATP lead to initiation of secondary differentiation. Further support from this came from work by Kuwabara et al. who showed effects of ATP, GTP, and glucose on the activity of different Rsb components(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>). Finally, work from Soules et al. identified TCA intermediates as ligands for RsbU, linking the TCA cycle and ATP synthesis to the Rsb system(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>). However, no effect was noted on premature late gene expression in these experimental systems.</p>
<p>Sequestration/inactivation of the major sigma factor under low ATP conditions would presumably render RNA polymerase free to interact with the alternative sigma factors, σ<sup>54</sup> and σ<sup>28</sup>. These alternative sigma factors have been linked to late gene expression with studies from Soules et al. and Hatch and Ouellette indicating that σ<sup>54</sup> is associated with increased transcription of outer membrane components, type III secretion (T3S) system components, and other genes typically expressed late in development(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>). However, some of these changes are likely indirect and downstream to the σ<sup>54</sup> regulon itself since some affected genes have been shown to have σ<sup>66</sup> promoter sequence elements(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>). Significant remodeling of the outer membrane occurs as the RB transitions to the EB(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>), and, similarly, the EB is prepackaged with T3S effectors, like TarP(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>), that facilitate EB invasion into a target host cell. σ<sup>28</sup> was shown to control expression of two canonical late genes: <italic>hctB</italic> and <italic>tsp</italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>). Each of the encoded proteins is highly toxic if overexpressed(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>), suggesting that the additional layer of regulation by σ<sup>28</sup> is necessary to ensure EBs are formed at the correct time. Hatch and Ouellette proposed that these genes may be the last to be activated precisely because of this(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>). Overall, these data clearly link transcriptional regulation, via the sigma factors, to developmental cycle progression and secondary differentiation.</p>
<p>Despite the clear changes in transcription that occur during the chlamydial developmental cycle, activation of late gene expression alone does not guarantee secondary differentiation. We recently explored the function of the Clp protease systems in chlamydial growth and development(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>). Interestingly, we observed that the inability to degrade SsrA-tagged products prevented functional secondary differentiation with a severe defect in EB production. This was demonstrated in strains unable to degrade SsrA products either by preventing their recognition by ClpX or by altering the SsrA tag to a version that is not degraded efficiently. Nonetheless, late gene transcription was activated in these strains. Therefore, post-translational regulation of secondary differentiation is also critical to the process.</p>
<p>Assuming a post-translational gene regulation model for secondary differentiation, we were interested in exploring known differences between EBs and RBs as a clue to what factors could be serving as a signal for this process. EBs and RBs differ in a number of characteristics, from their function to their morphology to their gene expression. In 2013, a study from Barker et al. added another difference – their relative levels of c-di-AMP with RBs having lower levels than EBs. Although the study from Barker et al. was focused on understanding how IFNβ is activated in <italic>Chlamydia</italic>-infected cells, we were intrigued by this relative difference in c-di-AMP levels. We hypothesized that c-di-AMP production might be a signal for secondary differentiation. We compared chlamydial growth in normal HeLa or STING-KO HeLa cells but could not detect any differences in growth in these cell types (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> and S2 vs Fig. S6), indicating that c-di-AMP production by <italic>Chlamydia</italic> is unlikely used as means of activating the host cell. Rather, STING activation is “accidental”. Using recently developed genetic tools for <italic>Chlamydia</italic>, we demonstrated that we could manipulate the levels of c-di-AMP in the bacterium to either block or stimulate its production. Excitingly, we observed that elevated c-di-AMP was linked to earlier secondary differentiation whereas blocking c-di-AMP production prevented EB production (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>). Importantly, c-di-AMP production resulted in an increase in late gene transcripts as noted above for the function of the alternative sigma factors. Therefore, c-di-AMP may act as a post-translational mechanism to trigger secondary differentiation. However, we cannot exclude a function for c-di-AMP in directly manipulating gene expression by riboswitches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>), and further work is necessary to understand how c-di-AMP directly controls chlamydial development. To our knowledge, this is the first study to identify and provide experimental evidence for a signaling factor involved in differentiation of an obligate intracellular bacterium.</p>
<p>How might c-di-AMP function in <italic>Chlamydia</italic>? This is not readily apparent because <italic>Chlamydia</italic> lacks orthologs of proteins that have been characterized in other bacterial systems to bind c-di-AMP. For example, <italic>Chlamydia</italic> lacks annotated K<sup>+</sup> transporters, and it is unknown how these bacteria maintain their osmolarity. However, a recent study suggested that changes in K<sup>+</sup> levels affect the chlamydial developmental cycle(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>). Therefore, c-di-AMP may function as a K<sup>+</sup> homeostasis coordinator in <italic>Chlamydia</italic> through as-yet unknown pathways. We did observe altered chlamydial morphology in some of our strains in which we altered c-di-AMP levels, and this may indicate changes in osmostability or effects on cell division. In regard to the latter possibility, in <italic>S. aureus</italic>, DacA activity is inhibited by interacting with GlmM (phosphoglucosamine mutase)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>). GlmM produces UDP-GlcNAc that is a precursor in both peptidoglycan and LPS synthesis. Given that <italic>Chlamydia</italic> uses peptidoglycan for cell division, we tested whether DacA and YbbR were localized to the division septum. However, their localization was not associated with the division septum (Fig. S7). In addition, we did not detect an interaction between DacA and GlmM using the Bacterial Adenylate Cyclase-based Two Hybrid (BACTH) system (data not shown), and the chlamydial GlmM lacks the residues required for DacA interaction. Therefore, we conclude that DacA and YbbR are unlikely to directly impact cell division. However, based on the cell morphological changes in DacA overexpression, we cannot exclude a function for c-di-AMP on cell wall metabolism. Future studies will focus on identifying c-di-AMP binding proteins and characterizing their function in <italic>Chlamydia</italic>.</p>
<p>The use of c-di-AMP as a signal for secondary differentiation presents a “chicken-or-egg” quandary. How is the activity and expression of DacA, the diadenylate cyclase, regulated? Our transcript analyses indicate that <italic>dacA-ybbR</italic> transcripts peak during the RB phase of growth, similar to most genes in <italic>Chlamydia</italic>. One possibility not easily tested due to the obligate intracellular nature of <italic>Chlamydia</italic>, is that c-di-AMP production depletes ATP levels, which then reduce σ<sup>66</sup> activity as described above. Our data indicate YbbR is necessary to activate DacA function since expressing DacA alone had no significant impact on overall c-di-AMP levels (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>). However, overexpressing DacA alone did negatively impact chlamydial growth, suggesting that the balance between DacA and YbbR levels is important, with YbbR being the limiting factor for c-di-AMP production. For example, too much DacA insertion into the membrane without binding to YbbR may disrupt the membrane biology of the RB. Therefore, YbbR itself may be a target for regulation. As a monotopic transmembrane protein, YbbR may be degraded by proteases such as the inner membrane-associated FtsH or the periplasmic proteases HtrA or Tsp. This would presumably shut down c-di-AMP synthesis. Alternatively, DacA may interact with other membrane proteins, and overexpressing it alone may impair the function of this binding partner(s), resulting in the observed phenotypes. However, this possibility contradicts the effects of overexpressing the D164N isoform, which blocked c-di-AMP production. These experiments were conducted in the presence of the chromosomally expressed copy of DacA, and we suggest that the mutant isoform acts as a dominant negative by interfering with the wild-type function or by titrating away YbbR from the wild-type DacA. In contrast, knocking down <italic>dacA-ybbR</italic> transcripts will reduce, but not completely eliminate, DacA-YbbR protein, which may result in residual c-di-AMP levels as compared to the DacA mutant as well as the slight phenotypic differences between these strains. Further work is needed to test these possibilities. However, our data are clear in linking c-di-AMP levels to chlamydial developmental progression.</p>
<p>Even though diverse functions of c-di-AMP in other bacteria have been reported previously, this is the first time c-di-AMP has been described as a checkpoint in chlamydial development. It is possible that the levels of c-di-AMP act as a de facto means for monitoring the bacterial population within the inclusion or for their overall developmental status. Canonical bacteria can use quorum sensing to detect bacteria at the population level and to communicate with other species(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>). However, <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> lacks homologues of genes related to quorum sensing(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>). In addition, secondary differentiation occurs asynchronously, and this feature is different from a quorum sensing mechanism. Our model accounts for the asynchronicity of secondary differentiation. As RBs accumulate c-di-AMP and divide, it is likely the c-di-AMP will be distributed unevenly between the mother and daughter cell since <italic>Chlamydia</italic> divides through an asymmetric budding mechanism(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>) (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>). This will lead to two cells with different levels of c-di-AMP, one of which may then accumulate enough c-di-AMP to trigger secondary differentiation while the other continues to divide (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>). This is consistent with a recent model proposing that a population of division-competent RBs is maintained throughout the developmental cycle(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>).</p>

<p>Other ongoing studies in the lab have revealed additional post-translational mechanisms that drive secondary differentiation (Jensen et al. <italic>in revision</italic>; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>)), thus it seems likely that <italic>Chlamydia</italic> integrates multiple signal inputs to ensure that all conditions are met before undergoing this essential step in their biology.</p>

During this step, McCoy cells were washed with 2 mL Hank’s Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS) media containing Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Mg<sup>2+</sup> (Gibco). After that, McCoy cells were infected with the transformants in 2 mL HBSS per well. The plate was centrifuged at 400 x g for 15 min at room temperature and incubated at 37°C for 15 min. The inoculum was aspirated, and 2 mL 1X DMEM containing 10% FBS and 10 μg/mL gentamicin was added per well. At 8 hours post infection (hpi), 1 μg/mL cycloheximide and either 1 or 2 U/mL penicillin G or 500 μg/mL spectinomycin were added, and the plate was incubated at 37°C until 48 hpi.

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The paper by Lee and Ouellette explores the role of cyclic-d-AMP in chlamydial developmental progression. The manuscript uses a collection of different recombinant plasmids to up- and down-regulate cdAMP production, and then uses classical molecular and microbiological approaches to examine the effects of expression induction in each of the transformed strains.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This laboratory is a leader in the use of molecular genetic manipulation in Chlamydia trachomatis and their efforts to make such efforts mainstream is commendable. Overall, the model described and defended by these investigators is thorough and significant.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The biggest weakness in the document is their reliance on quantitative data that is statistically not significant, in the interpretation of results. These challenges can be addressed in a revision by the authors.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This manuscript describes the role of the production of c-di-AMP on the chlamydial developmental cycle. Chlamydia are obligate intracellular bacterial pathogens that rely on eukaryotic host cells for growth. The chlamydial life cycle depends on a cell form developmental cycle that produces phenotypically distinct cell forms with specific roles during the infectious cycle. The RB cell form replicates amplifying chlamydia numbers while the EB cell form mediates entry into new host cells disseminating the infection to new hosts. Regulation of cell form development is a critical question in chlamydia biology and pathogenesis. Chlamydia must balance amplification (RB numbers) and dissemination (EB numbers) to maximize survival in its infection niche. The main findings In this manuscript show that overexpression of the dacA-ybbR operon results in increased production of c-di-AMP and early expression of the transitionary gene hctA and late gene omcB. The authors also knocked down the expression of the dacA-ybbR operon and reported a reduction in the expression of both hctA and omcB. The authors conclude with a model suggesting the amount of c-di-AMP determines the fate of the RB, continued replication, or EB conversion. Overall, this is a very intriguing study with important implications however the data is very preliminary and the model is very rudimentary and is not well supported by the data.</p>
<p>Describing the significance of the findings:</p>
<p>The findings are important and point to very exciting new avenues to explore the important questions in chlamydial cell form development. The authors present a model that is not quantified and does not match the data well.</p>
<p>Describing the strength of evidence:</p>
<p>The evidence presented is incomplete. The authors do a nice job of showing that overexpression of the dacA-ybbR operon increases c-di-AMP and that knockdown or overexpression of the catalytically dead DacA protein decreases the c-di-AMP levels. However, the effects on the developmental cycle and how they fit the proposed model are less well supported.</p>
<p>dacA-ybbR ectopic expression:</p>
<p>For the dacA-ybbR ectopic expression experiments they show that hctA is induced early but there is no significant change in OmcB gene expression. This is problematic as when RBs are treated with Pen (this paper) and (DOI 10.1128/MSYSTEMS.00689-20) hctA is expressed in the aberrant cell forms but these forms do not go on to express the late genes suggesting stress events can result in changes in the developmental expression kinetic profile. The RNA-seq data are a little reassuring as many of the EB/Late genes were shown to be upregulated by dacA-ybbR ectopic expression in this assay.</p>
<p>The authors also demonstrate that this ectopic expression reduces the overall growth rate but produces EBs earlier in the cycle but overall fewer EBs late in the cycle. This observation matches their model well as when RBs convert early there is less amplification of cell numbers.</p>
<p>dacA knockdown and dacA(mut)</p>
<p>The authors showed that dacA knockdown and ectopic expression of the dacA mutant both reduced the amount of c-di-AMP. The authors show that for both of these conditions, hctA and omcB expression is reduced at 24 hpi. This was also partially supported by the RNA-seq data for the dacA knockdown as many of the late genes were downregulated. However, a shift to an increase in RB-only genes was not readily evident. This is maybe not surprising as the chlamydial inclusion would just have an increase in RB forms and changes in cell form ratios would need more time points.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the overall growth rate appears to differ in these two conditions, growth is unaffected by dacA knockdown but is significantly affected by the expression of the mutant. In both cases, EB production is repressed. The overall model they present does not support this data well as if RBs were blocked from converting into EBs then the growth rate should increase as the RB cell form replicates while the EB cell form does not. This should shift the population to replicating cells.</p>
<p>Overall this is a very intriguing finding that will require more gene expression data, phenotypic characterization of cell forms, and better quantitative models to fully interpret these findings.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The paper by Lee and Ouellette explores the role of cyclic-d-AMP in chlamydial developmental progression. The manuscript uses a collection of different recombinant plasmids to up- and down-regulate cdAMP production, and then uses classical molecular and microbiological approaches to examine the effects of expression induction in each of the transformed strains.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This laboratory is a leader in the use of molecular genetic manipulation in Chlamydia trachomatis and their efforts to make such efforts mainstream is commendable. Overall, the model described and defended by these investigators is thorough and significant.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The biggest weakness in the document is their reliance on quantitative data that is statistically not significant, in the interpretation of results. These challenges can be addressed in a revision by the authors.</p>

<p>Thank you for these comments. We have generated new data, which we hope the reviewer will find more compelling. These will be included in a revised manuscript.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This manuscript describes the role of the production of c-di-AMP on the chlamydial developmental cycle. Chlamydia are obligate intracellular bacterial pathogens that rely on eukaryotic host cells for growth. The chlamydial life cycle depends on a cell form developmental cycle that produces phenotypically distinct cell forms with specific roles during the infectious cycle. The RB cell form replicates amplifying chlamydia numbers while the EB cell form mediates entry into new host cells disseminating the infection to new hosts. Regulation of cell form development is a critical question in chlamydia biology and pathogenesis. Chlamydia must balance amplification (RB numbers) and dissemination (EB numbers) to maximize survival in its infection niche. The main findings In this manuscript show that overexpression of the dacA-ybbR operon results in increased production of c-di-AMP and early expression of the transitionary gene hctA and late gene omcB. The authors also knocked down the expression of the dacA-ybbR operon and reported a reduction in the expression of both hctA and omcB. The authors conclude with a model suggesting the amount of c-di-AMP determines the fate of the RB, continued replication, or EB conversion. Overall, this is a very intriguing study with important implications however the data is very preliminary and the model is very rudimentary and is not well supported by the data.</p>

<p>Describing the significance of the findings:</p>
<p>The findings are important and point to very exciting new avenues to explore the important questions in chlamydial cell form development. The authors present a model that is not quantified and does not match the data well.</p>
<p>Describing the strength of evidence:</p>

<p>As the reviewer notes, we also generated RNAseq data, which validates that late gene transcripts (including sigma28 and sigma54 regulated genes) are statistically significantly increased earlier in the developmental cycle in parallel to increased c-di-AMP levels. The lack of statistical significance in the RT-qPCR data for omcB, which shows a trend of higher transcripts, is less concerning given the statistically significantly RNAseq dataset. We have reported the data from three replicates for the RT-qPCR and do not think it would be worthwhile to attempt more replicates in an attempt to “achieve” statistical significance.</p>

<p>Thank you for this comment. We agree that it is not surprising given the shift in cell forms. The reduction in hctA transcripts argues against a stress state as noted above by the reviewer, and the RNAseq data from dacA-KD conditions indicates at least that secondary differentiation has been delayed. We will try to clarify this in a revision.</p>

<p>We agree that it seems that perturbing c-di-AMP production, whether by knockdown or overexpressing the mutant DacA(D164N), has an overall negative impact on chlamydial growth. We have generated new data, which we think will address this. These new data will be included in a revised manuscript.</p>
