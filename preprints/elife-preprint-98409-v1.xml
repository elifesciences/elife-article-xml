<title>Abstract</title>
<p><italic>Chlamydia trachomatis</italic> is an obligate intracellular bacterial pathogen with a unique developmental cycle. It differentiates between two functional and morphological forms: elementary body (EB) and reticulate body (RB). The signals that trigger differentiation from one form to the other are unknown. EBs and RBs have distinctive characteristics that distinguish them, including their size, infectivity, proteome, and transcriptome. Intriguingly, they also differ in their overall redox status as EBs are oxidized and RBs are reduced. We hypothesize that alterations in redox may serve as a trigger for secondary differentiation. To test this, we examined the function of the primary antioxidant enzyme alkyl hydroperoxide reductase subunit C (AhpC), a well-known member of the peroxiredoxins family, in chlamydial growth and development. Based on our hypothesis, we predicted that altering the expression of <italic>ahpC</italic> will modulate chlamydial redox status and trigger earlier or delayed secondary differentiation. To test this, we created <italic>ahpC</italic> overexpression and knockdown strains. During <italic>ahpC</italic> knockdown, ROS levels were elevated, and the bacteria were sensitive to a broad set of peroxide stresses. Interestingly, we observed increased expression of EB-associated genes and concurrent higher production of EBs at an earlier time in the developmental cycle, indicating earlier secondary differentiation occurs under elevated oxidation conditions. In contrast, overexpression of AhpC created a resistant phenotype against oxidizing agents and delayed secondary differentiation. Together, these results indicate that redox potential is a critical factor in developmental cycle progression. For the first time, our study provides a mechanism of chlamydial secondary differentiation dependent on redox status.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>All organisms that are exposed to oxygen are necessarily subjected to oxidative stress. Specifically, the process of metabolizing substrates in the presence of oxygen can generate reactive oxygen species (ROS), which are toxic at high enough concentrations. Thus, from bacteria to humans, systems have evolved to mitigate the accumulation of ROS. At the same time, host defense mechanisms have evolved to leverage ROS production as a means of limiting pathogen growth and survival. Not surprisingly, pathogens have co-evolved to resist these defense mechanisms. For example, many pathogens possess a variety of antioxidant enzymes, such as catalases, glutathione peroxidases, and peroxiredoxins, that help them both subvert ROS-mediated immune system assaults and mitigate metabolic ROS byproducts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Staerck et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Wan et al., 2021</xref>).</p>
<p><italic>Chlamydia</italic> is an obligate intracellular bacterium that has significantly reduced its genome size and content in adapting to obligate host dependence. <italic>Chlamydia trachomatis</italic>, the leading cause of bacterial sexually transmitted diseases and preventable infectious blindness, lacks homologs to catalases or glutathione peroxidases but does possess a homolog of Alkyl hydroperoxide reductase subunit C (AhpC). AhpC is a well-known member of the peroxiredoxins family and is widely conserved in prokaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">de Oliveira et al., 2021</xref>). Peroxiredoxins can scavenge hydrogen peroxide, peroxynitrite, and organic hydroperoxides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Parsonage et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Poole &amp; Ellis, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Seaver &amp; Imlay, 2001</xref>) and act as the primary scavenger in pathogens that lack both catalase and glutathione peroxidases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Mastronicola et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Richard et al., 2011</xref>). Several studies from other bacterial systems have shown that AhpC has a significant role in ROS and RNI scavenging, virulence, and persistence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Cosgrove et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Kimura et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Oh &amp; Jeon, 2014</xref>), and deletion of AhpC creates highly oxidized conditions within the bacterium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>). However, the function of AhpC in chlamydial biology has not been characterized.</p>
<p><italic>Chlamydia</italic> is unique among pathogens in undergoing a complex developmental cycle that comprises two distinct morphological forms, the elementary body (EB) and reticulate body (RB) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Abdelrahman &amp; Belland, 2005</xref>). The EB is the smaller (∼0.3 μm), infectious, and non-dividing form capable of infecting susceptible host cells. Once internalized into a host-derived vacuole termed an inclusion, the EB differentiates into the non-infectious, larger (∼1 μm), and replicating RB - this process is known as primary differentiation and represents the early phase of the developmental cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Clifton et al., 2005</xref>). RBs replicate within the inclusion in the mid-cycle phase using an asymmetric, MreB-dependent polarized division process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Abdelrahman et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Lee et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Ouellette et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Ouellette et al., 2020</xref>). In the late phase of the developmental cycle, RBs asynchronously condense into EBs, and this process is termed secondary differentiation. Despite these well-defined differences between chlamydial morphological forms, how <italic>Chlamydia</italic> mechanistically differentiates between functional forms remains unclear.</p>
<p>Intriguingly, a recent study evaluated the redox potential of <italic>Chlamydia</italic> and demonstrated that RBs are reduced, whereas EBs are oxidized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Wang et al., 2014</xref>). This is consistent with earlier studies that revealed differences in the crosslinking of outer membrane proteins and type III secretion-related proteins in chlamydial developmental forms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Betts-Hampikian &amp; Fields, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Caldwell et al., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Everett &amp; Hatch, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Wang et al., 2014</xref>). Taken together, these observations indicate that, during the developmental cycle, the redox potential of the bacteria is changing. However, whether redox changes in the bacteria directly affect developmental cycle progression is not characterized. Based on the different redox status of the chlamydial developmental forms, we hypothesized that increasing the oxidation of the RB drives secondary differentiation to the EB. We used chlamydial transformants designed to overexpress or reduce AhpC levels to explore the effects of altered redox potential in chlamydial growth and development to test this hypothesis. This study establishes the role of AhpC as an antioxidant in <italic>Chlamydia,</italic> as demonstrated by its ability to counteract different peroxide stresses when overexpressed. Overexpression of AhpC had no negative effect on bacterial replication but delayed the differentiation of RBs to EBs. In contrast, under conditions of <italic>ahpC</italic> knockdown, the organism was highly sensitive to oxidizing conditions. Interestingly, this change in redox potential caused earlier expression of EB-associated (late) genes and production of EBs, leading to a shift in developmental cycle progression. This earlier activation of gene expression related to secondary differentiation in <italic>ahpC</italic> knockdown was also observed when developmental cycle progression was blocked by penicillin treatment. Taken together these data provide mechanistic insight into chlamydial secondary differentiation and are the first to demonstrate redox-regulated differentiation in <italic>Chlamydia</italic>.</p>

<title>The redox threshold hypothesis and chlamydial secondary differentiation</title>
<p>The chlamydial EB and RB developmental forms differ in size, infectivity, and division capacity. In addition to these characteristics, both forms also differ in their redox status: EBs are oxidized and RBs are reduced (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). Based on this information, we hypothesized that changing redox potential is a critical factor in the process of differentiation from one form to the other. We named this the “redox threshold hypothesis”. In this scenario, as soon as a given RB has crossed an oxidative threshold, the activity of critical proteins is modified to trigger differentiation to the EB (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>). AhpC is an antioxidant enzyme, and several reports have indicated that ablation of <italic>ahpC</italic> creates highly oxidized conditions in bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Feng et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>). Therefore, we hypothesize that AhpC, which maintains redox homeostasis in other bacteria, is a critical factor in mediating developmental cycle progression and that altering its activity will impact developmental cycle progression consistent with the redox threshold hypothesis (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>).</p>

<title>Overexpression of <italic>ahpC</italic> has minimal impact on chlamydial growth</title>
<p>To study the effect of AhpC on chlamydial developmental cycle progression, we first generated an <italic>ahpC</italic> overexpression (OE) strain using a plasmid encoding an anhydrotetracycline (aTc)-inducible <italic>ahpC</italic> (untagged) and transformed it into a <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> L2 strain lacking its endogenous plasmid (-pL2). The same plasmid vector backbone (i.e., encoding mCherry in place of <italic>ahpC</italic>) was used as an empty vector control (EV). HeLa cells were infected with these transformants, and, at 10 hpi, expression of the construct was induced or not. Lacking an antibody against AhpC, overexpression of <italic>ahpC</italic> was validated by reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). Here, an approximate 1-log increase in transcripts of <italic>ahpC</italic> was detected at 14 and 24 hpi in the induced strain in comparison to the uninduced strain (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>).</p>

<title>Overexpression of <italic>ahpC</italic> confers resistance to peroxides in <italic>Chlamydia</italic></title>
<p>AhpC is an important peroxiredoxin involved in oxidative damage defense. Before determining whether increased <italic>ahpC</italic> expression impacts chlamydial sensitivity to oxidizing agents, we first sought to determine the response of <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> to inorganic or organic hydroperoxides such as hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>), cumene hydroperoxide (CHP), and tert-butyl hydroperoxide (TBHP) as well as peroxynitrite (PN). To do this, we evaluated the sensitivity of HeLa cells, infected or not with the empty vector (EV) control strain, to different concentrations of oxidizing agents using a viability assay. Both uninfected and EV-infected HeLa cells tolerated up to 1 mM oxidizing agents for 30 min (Fig. S1). Next, different concentrations (lower than 1 mM) of these oxidants were tested on wild-type (WT) <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> L2/434/Bu (<italic>Ctr</italic> L2). HeLa cells were infected with <italic>Ctr</italic> L2 and, at 16 hpi, were exposed to different concentrations of exogenous oxidizing agents for 30 min only, before washing out the oxidizing agents and replacing the media. Samples for IFU and IFA assays were then collected at 24 hpi to assess effects of the oxidizing agents on growth of <italic>Ctr</italic> L2. 62.5 μM concentration of all three inorganic and organic peroxides had no appreciable effect on IFUs, and inclusion size and morphology also remained unaffected at this sublethal concentration. The concentrations of inorganic and organic peroxides that resulted in a decrease in IFUs to ∼50% of the untreated culture were 500 μM (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) and 250 μM (CHP and TBHP), respectively, with a concurrent decrease in inclusion size. 1 mM H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, CHP, and TBHP caused &gt;90% reduction in IFUs and small inclusions. PN at 1 mM concentration was less effective than other oxidizing agents and showed only a ∼30% decline in IFUs compared to the untreated culture (Fig. S2).</p>
<p>To further examine the antioxidant functions of AhpC, we next exploited our <italic>ahpC</italic> overexpression strain to explore its capability to protect chlamydiae from oxidizing agents. Both <italic>ahpC</italic> OE and EV strains were used to infect HeLa cells and, at 10 hpi, expression of the constructs was induced or not with 1 nM aTc. At 16 hpi, infected cells were exposed to various concentrations of exogenous oxidizing agents for 30 min. At 24 hpi, IFU and IFA samples were collected to measure chlamydial growth and assess chlamydial morphology, respectively. As shown in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>, 3B, and S3, the <italic>ahpC</italic> overexpression strain showed increased resistance to all oxidants tested as the mean IFUs and the size of inclusions were greater than that of the uninduced but treated control. There was no change in bacterial growth and morphology in the case of 62.5 μM concentrations of oxidizing agents, which was anticipated since we determined this was a sublethal concentration. The resistant phenotype was more evident at the higher concentrations of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, CHP, and TBHP. Overexpression of <italic>ahpC</italic> also contributed to higher resistance against PN. Conversely, the empty vector control strain behaved as expected (i.e., like WT) in the presence of oxidizing agents, with similar results observed in the presence or absence of aTc (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3D</xref>, and S3). Collectively, these data demonstrate that the chlamydial AhpC possesses antioxidant activity, as expected, and that increased <italic>ahpC</italic> expression is protective for <italic>Chlamydia</italic> in the presence of increased oxidative stress.</p>

<title>Knockdown of <italic>ahpC</italic> negatively impacts chlamydial growth</title>
<p>To further define the function(s) of AhpC in the chlamydial developmental cycle, we used a novel dCas12-based CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) strategy adapted for <italic>Chlamydia</italic> by our lab (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Ouellette, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Ouellette et al., 2021</xref>). We generated an <italic>ahpC</italic> knockdown strain harboring the pBOMBL12CRia with a crRNA targeting the <italic>ahpC</italic> 5’ intergenic region (plasmid designated as pL12CRia(<italic>ahpC</italic>)). We used a strain carrying a pL12CRia plasmid with a crRNA with no homology to any chlamydial sequence (i.e., non-targeting [NT]) to serve as a negative control. To confirm the knockdown of <italic>ahpC</italic>, RT-qPCR was employed. Here, we infected HeLa cells with the <italic>ahpC</italic> knockdown (<italic>ahpC</italic> KD) or NT strains and induced dCas12 expression or not at 10 hpi using 1 nM aTc. Nucleic acid samples were harvested at 14 hpi and 24 hpi. RT-qPCR analysis of the <italic>ahpC</italic> KD revealed approximately 90% reduction of <italic>ahpC</italic> transcripts compared to the uninduced control, thus confirming the knockdown of <italic>ahpC</italic> (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>). In the case of the NT control, there was no effect on <italic>ahpC</italic> transcripts. IFA of these strains revealed noticeably smaller inclusions after blocking expression of <italic>ahpC</italic> as compared to the uninduced sample or the NT conditions (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>). We next measured total bacterial counts using genomic DNA. Surprisingly, even though inclusions were smaller during <italic>ahpC</italic> knockdown, we observed slightly higher gDNA levels at 14 hpi compared to the uninduced control, followed by only a small increase from 14 to 24 hpi (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>). In contrast, the uninduced strain showed a logarithmic increase in gDNA levels during this timeframe. These effects were not detected for the NT strain (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>). To further explore the effect of reduced <italic>ahpC</italic> transcripts in <italic>Chlamydia</italic>, IFU assays were performed. IFU analysis exhibited severely reduced progeny (&gt;90%) in <italic>ahpC</italic> knockdown compared to its respective uninduced control at both time points assessed (24 and 48 hpi) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref>). In contrast, the NT strain showed less than a 50% reduction after inducing dCas12 expression at these timepoints consistent with prior observations that dCas12 expression slightly delays developmental cycle progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Hatch &amp; Ouellette, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Reuter et al., 2023</xref>). Taken together, these analyses indicate that reducing <italic>ahpC</italic> levels and/or activity severely disrupted chlamydial growth and development.</p>

<p>To investigate whether <italic>ahpC</italic> knockdown resulted in increased ROS levels in the bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>), the intracellular ROS levels were measured in infected cells in <italic>ahpC</italic> knockdown conditions and compared to the uninduced control condition and uninfected cells. We used the cell-permeable, fluorogenic dye CellROX Deep Red to measure ROS levels. This dye remains non-fluorescent in a reduced state and exhibits bright fluorescence once oxidized by ROS.

<title>Knockdown of <italic>ahpC</italic> sensitizes <italic>Chlamydia</italic> to oxidizing agents</title>
<p>As overexpression of <italic>ahpC</italic> resulted in increased resistance to oxidizing agents, we next explored whether knockdown of <italic>ahpC</italic> resulted in increased sensitivity to such agents. As described above, <italic>ahpC</italic> KD and NT strains were used to infect HeLa cells and, at 10 hpi, expression of dCas12 was induced or not with 1 nM aTc. Considering that the <italic>ahpC</italic> KD already demonstrated reduced IFUs and inclusion sizes at 24 hpi, only sublethal concentrations (62.5 μM) of exogenous oxidizing agents were applied. At 24 hpi, IFA and IFU analyses were performed to quantify the effect of the oxidants on chlamydial growth in the absence of <italic>ahpC</italic> activity. Under conditions of <italic>ahpC</italic> knockdown, even sublethal concentrations (62.5 μM) of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, CHP, or TBHP further reduced the inclusion size, and the IFU data revealed a decrease from &gt;90% to &lt;30% in comparison to the untreated control (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5B</xref>, and S4).

<title>Complementation restores the growth and resistance to low levels of peroxide stress of the <italic>ahpC</italic> knockdown strain</title>
<p>To validate that the impaired growth, altered inclusion morphology, and enhanced sensitivity to peroxides were due to the decreased level/activity of AhpC, we generated a complemented strain of <italic>ahpC</italic> knockdown. For the construction of the <italic>ahpC</italic> complementing plasmid, the <italic>ahpC</italic> gene was cloned and transcriptionally fused 3’ to the dCas12 in the pL12CRia(<italic>ahpC</italic>) knockdown plasmid. Here, the complementing <italic>ahpC</italic> allele is also under the control of the aTc-induced P<italic>tet</italic> promoter and is co-expressed with the aTc-inducible dCas12. Consequently, the <italic>ahpC</italic> knockdown effect is ablated, and the observed phenotypes should be restored. After inducing <italic>dCas12-ahpC</italic> expression with aTc, the resultant strain was verified by RT-qPCR. Increased transcripts for <italic>ahpC</italic> were quantified under these conditions, indicating successful complementation of the knockdown effect (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>). Of note, the <italic>ahpC</italic> transcript levels remained elevated in comparison to the uninduced control at the 24hpi time point. After confirming this strain, we measured genomic DNA to quantify total bacteria and performed IFA and IFU assays to examine if complementation restored the phenotypes observed during <italic>ahpC</italic> knockdown. These assays revealed normal inclusion morphology, gDNA levels, and EB progeny production in the complemented strain, indicating successful complementation of the knockdown phenotype (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B, C</xref>, and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">D</xref>).

<p>We next assessed whether complementation of the knockdown phenotype could also restore the resistance to low levels of peroxide stress. As in previous experiments, a sublethal concentration of oxidizing agents was added for 30’ at 16 hpi after having induced <italic>dCas12-ahpC</italic> expression at 10 hpi. Consistent with the growth parameters (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B-D</xref>), the complemented strain showed wild-type responses in these conditions (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6E</xref>, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6F</xref>, and S4). These data indicate that the enhanced susceptibility of the <italic>ahpC</italic> knockdown strain to oxidizing agents was due to the reduced levels of <italic>ahpC</italic> and not an indirect effect of knockdown.</p>
<p>We predicted that the growth defects resulting from higher production of ROS during <italic>ahpC</italic> knockdown could be rescued by treating the <italic>ahpC</italic> KD with ROS scavengers. To test this prediction, we utilized two characterized ROS scavengers, DMTU (<italic>N,N’-dimethylthiourea</italic>) and α-tocopherol, which scavenge H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and peroxyl radical, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Hollander-Czytko et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Kiffin et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Walch et al., 2015</xref>). First, the effect of ROS scavengers on uninfected and infected HeLa cells was investigated using a viability assay. This assay revealed that 10 mM DMTU and 100 µM α-tocopherol had no adverse effects on uninfected or EV-infected HeLa cells (data not shown). These same concentrations were tested on WT <italic>Ctr</italic> L2 infected HeLa cells in untreated and 500 µM H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> treated conditions to test the potency of these scavengers to rescue growth defects associated with this concentration of oxidizing agent. Scavengers were added at 9.5 hpi and washed away at 16 hpi - the time of addition of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in the respective samples. At 16.5 hpi, after 3 wash steps, scavengers were added again with fresh media, and, at 24 hpi, bacterial growth and morphology were assessed using IFU and IFA assays. Neither scavenger had a significant impact on chlamydial morphology or infectious progeny. In the case of peroxide (500 µM H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) treated samples, scavengers restored IFUs from ∼50% to ∼100%, and inclusion size was also recovered (Fig. S5A and B).</p>
<p>Next, the effect of the ROS scavengers under <italic>ahpC</italic> knockdown conditions was assessed. In this experiment, scavengers were added at 9.5 hpi to provide the protective effect of scavengers before reducing the activity of <italic>ahpC</italic>. At 10 hpi, knockdown was induced or not with 1 nM aTc, and, at 14 hpi, scavengers were added again. At 24 hpi, IFU and IFA samples were collected to examine bacterial growth and morphology to assess the effect of ROS scavenging on the <italic>ahpC</italic> knockdown phenotype. As shown in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6G</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6H</xref>, both ROS scavengers had a positive impact on restoring growth of the <italic>ahpC</italic> knockdown strain; inclusions were larger, and IFUs were increased from &lt;10% to &gt;90% in the presence of scavengers in the induced samples. These data provide compelling evidence that the adverse effects of <italic>ahpC</italic> knockdown are due to increased ROS accumulation in this strain.</p>

<title>Chlamydial developmental cycle progression is altered by <italic>ahpC</italic> knockdown/ overexpression</title>
<p>Whereas the overexpression of AhpC delayed overall developmental progression and was consistent with our hypothesis, the results with the <italic>ahpC</italic> knockdown strain appeared to refute our hypothesis given the apparent decrease in IFUs and smaller inclusion sizes after knockdown. To investigate the effects of changes in redox potential on chlamydial developmental cycle progression, we performed a transcriptional analysis of well-characterized late-cycle genes associated with secondary differentiation (<italic>hctA</italic>, <italic>hctB</italic>, <italic>glgA</italic>, <italic>tsp,</italic> and <italic>omcB</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Belland et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Gehre et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Newhall, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Ouellette et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Swoboda et al., 2023</xref>).

At 24 hpi, expression of these genes was comparable between the uninduced and induced conditions in the <italic>ahpC</italic> knockdown strain. In contrast, the complementation strain showed no increase in the expression of these tested late genes at 14 hpi, and <italic>tsp</italic> and <italic>glgA</italic> transcripts were reduced (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7C</xref>). Consistent with our model, the overexpression of <italic>ahpC</italic> resulted in significantly lower expression of <italic>hctA</italic>, <italic>hctB</italic>, <italic>omcB, tsp</italic>, and <italic>glgA</italic> at 14 and 24 hpi (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7D</xref>), suggesting a delayed transition to EBs.</p>

</fig>
<p>Given the increase in late gene expression during <italic>ahpC</italic> knockdown at an earlier time point in the developmental cycle than normal, we reasoned that the increase in oxidizing conditions might prematurely trigger secondary differentiation and EB production. However, complicating such an analysis is that fewer RBs are present to convert to EBs, which would result in overall lower IFU yields as we had measured at 24 and 48 hpi (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref>). Nonetheless, to assess EB production more rigorously at earlier time points in the developmental cycle, we performed a growth curve analysis to precisely measure IFUs at two-hour intervals from 16 to 24 hpi. HeLa cells were infected, and knockdown was induced or not at 10 hpi with 1 nM aTc. At the indicated time points, IFU samples were collected and quantified. Consistent with our prediction, this experiment revealed higher IFUs (i.e., EBs) at 16 and 18 hpi during <italic>ahpC</italic> knockdown compared to the uninduced samples (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7B</xref>). This difference was statistically significant at 18 hpi. However, further EB production was stalled, with the uninduced strain continuing to produce EBs such that, by 24 hpi, there were significantly higher EB yields under these conditions (as noted in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref>). These data show that the phenotypic consequence of higher expression at 14 hpi of genes functionally related to EBs is the concomitant earlier production of EBs. These data underscore that reduced activity of <italic>ahpC</italic> causes earlier secondary differentiation in <italic>C. trachomatis</italic>.</p>

<title><italic>ahpC</italic> knockdown activates transcription of late-cycle genes when bacterial replication is blocked</title>
<p>We detected earlier expression of EB-related genes during <italic>ahpC</italic> knockdown and were curious if the <italic>ahpC</italic> knockdown condition could activate these genes under conditions when the chlamydial developmental cycle is blocked. Pathogenic <italic>Chlamydia</italic> species undergo a polarized cell division process, in which peptidoglycan is transiently synthesized only at the division septum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Abdelrahman et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Cox et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Ouellette et al., 2020</xref>). As a result, during penicillin treatment, division of RBs is blocked (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Moulder, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Moulder et al., 1956</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Ouellette et al., 2020</xref>). However, the bacteria continue to grow in size resulting in aberrantly enlarged RBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Barbour et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Matsumoto &amp; Manire, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Ouellette et al., 2012</xref>), in which EB-related genes are not transcribed and production of EBs is inhibited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Ouellette et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Panzetta et al., 2018</xref>).</p>
<p>To examine this, we generated an <italic>ahpC</italic> KD strain with spectinomycin resistance (<italic>ahpC</italic> KD-spec) and validated its phenotype as being the same as the penicillin-resistant <italic>ahpC</italic> KD strain. This new strain, <italic>ahpC</italic> KD-spec, was used to infect HeLa cells, and knockdown was induced or not at 10 hpi with 1 nM aTc. At the same time, samples were treated or not with 1 unit per mL of penicillin (Pen). RNA samples were harvested at 16 and 24 hpi and processed for RT-qPCR (Fig. S6B-D). IFA controls from these different conditions demonstrated the expected phenotypes (Fig. S6A). For example, Pen treatment caused aberrantly enlarged RBs, irrespective of <italic>ahpC</italic> KD, whereas <italic>ahpC</italic> KD itself caused smaller inclusions. Similarly, <italic>ahpC</italic> KD resulted in reduced <italic>ahpC</italic> transcripts in the induced conditions irrespective of the presence of Pen (Fig. S6B). We next quantified transcript levels for the late genes <italic>hctA</italic> and <italic>hctB</italic> in these different conditions (Fig. S6C and D). As expected, in the uninduced and untreated condition, both transcripts had higher expression at 24 hpi, indicating their regular developmental expression during the late stage of the developmental cycle. Consistent with prior observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Ouellette et al., 2006</xref>), transcript levels of these genes in uninduced+Pen conditions was low. As we previously noted (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7A</xref>), the transcripts of <italic>hctA</italic> and <italic>hctB</italic> are higher in the induced than uninduced samples at 16 hpi in the absence of Pen. Interestingly, in the induced+ Pen condition, these genes had higher expression at 24 hpi than the uninduced+Pen control. At 16 hpi, their expression was either higher or similar between both samples (i.e., induced+Pen and uninduced+Pen). Collectively, these data support our observation that <italic>ahpC</italic> knockdown activates the transcription of late-cycle genes – even under conditions where developmental cycle progression is blocked.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Secondary differentiation (differentiation from RBs to EBs) is an essential step for chlamydial growth and survival, but there is a dearth of information regarding the mechanisms of its regulation. EBs and RBs have significantly different proteomic repertoires, and our group has identified critical functions for the cytoplasmic ClpXP and ClpCP and periplasmic Tsp proteases during secondary differentiation (Pan, Jensen et al., 2023; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Swoboda et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Wood et al., 2022</xref>). The <italic>tsp</italic> gene, in addition to another late-cycle gene, <italic>hctB</italic>, is transcriptionally regulated by sigma factor 28 (σ<sup>28</sup>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Hatch &amp; Ouellette, 2023</xref>). Another sigma factor, σ<sup>54</sup> has been linked to regulation of outer membrane components, type III secretion system components, and other genes typically expressed late in development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Hatch &amp; Ouellette, 2023</xref>; Soules, LaBrie, et al., 2020) . In addition to the two minor sigma factors, σ<sup>28</sup> and σ<sup>54</sup>, <italic>Chlamydia</italic> encodes one major sigma factor, σ<sup>66</sup>, which is transcriptionally regulated by the relative levels of RsbV1 (antagonist) and RsbW (anti-sigma factor) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Thompson et al., 2015</xref>). This Rsb system senses ATP availability and has been proposed to regulate σ<sup>66</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Thompson et al., 2015</xref>). A related study from Soules et al. (Soules, Dmitriev, et al., 2020) showed that TCA intermediates act as ligands for RsbU, thereby linking the Rsb system to the TCA cycle and ATP synthesis. Collectively, these data show that post-translational mechanisms drive secondary differentiation in <italic>Chlamydia</italic>. However, no definitive “switch” that triggers this step has been identified.</p>
<p>Aside from the clear morphological and functional differences between the EB and RB, they also differ in their redox status: EBs are more oxidized whereas RBs are more reduced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Wang et al., 2014</xref>). This same study noted that the overall redox status of the host cell was relatively unchanged throughout the developmental cycle, suggesting that changes in the bacteria were driven by endogenous processes (i.e., metabolism). Though <italic>Chlamydia</italic> is dependent on its host for most of its energy requirements, it has some metabolic activities, such as a partial TCA cycle and oxidative phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Gerard et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Iliffe-Lee &amp; McClarty, 1999</xref>) that can be possible sources of intracellular ROS. We hypothesize that accumulating redox stress from its metabolic activities serves as a signal to trigger secondary differentiation from RBs to EBs. There is a paucity of knowledge on how <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> modulates oxidative stress during disease pathogenesis. However, some studies explored the effects of redox changes on <italic>Chlamydia</italic> growth. Boncompain et al. reported that infection of <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> induced the transient production of ROS by the host cell at a moderate level for the initial few hours of infection only (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Boncompain et al., 2010</xref>). Another study also found a similar observation about ROS during infection, reporting that <italic>Chlamydia</italic> requires host-derived ROS for its growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Abdul-Sater et al., 2010</xref>). Given that no studies have examined the role of chlamydial proteins related to redox and how these proteins impact the growth of the pathogen, we initiated experiments to investigate the function of a key antioxidant enzyme, AhpC, as a means of testing our hypothesis.</p>
<p>Reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation is an inevitable condition for pathogens growing in aerobic conditions, and resistance against oxidative stress (imbalanced level of ROS) is a key survival mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Fang, 2011</xref>). Hence, pathogens have evolved detoxifying proteins, such as peroxiredoxins, to eliminate ROS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Dip et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Wang et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Yang et al., 2002</xref>). AhpC is a 2-cys peroxiredoxin and has been reported to have a crucial role in bacterial physiology, survival, and virulence by scavenging ROS and RNI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Cosgrove et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Kimura et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Loprasert et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Oh &amp; Jeon, 2014</xref>). In the process of detoxification of peroxides and peroxynitrite, AhpC is converted into an oxidized dimer, requiring alkyl hydroperoxide reductase AhpF or AhpD to regenerate its activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Koshkin et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Poole &amp; Ellis, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Wong et al., 2017</xref>). <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> encodes AhpC (Ct603) but lacks any annotated homologs of AhpF or AhpD. Therefore, it remains an open question how AhpC activity is regulated. Some studies have mentioned <italic>ahpC</italic> as an iron-responsive gene in <italic>Chlamydia</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Brinkworth et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Pokorzynski et al., 2019</xref>), but there is no detailed investigation to date about the role of this crucial antioxidant in the growth and development of <italic>Chlamydia</italic>.</p>
<p>Using a broad set of methodologies, we created and characterized overexpression and knockdown conditions of <italic>ahpC</italic>. Higher expression of <italic>ahpC</italic> resulted in lower EB production at 24 hpi coupled with a higher number of RBs and larger inclusion size (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>), suggesting differentiation from RBs to EBs is delayed. The number of EBs is further decreased at 48 hpi, but the difference is not statistically significant. This may be due to the highly oxidized conditions in <italic>Chlamydia</italic> at 48 hpi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Wang et al., 2014</xref>) or the inability of <italic>ahpC</italic> overexpression to generate sufficient reducing conditions to neutralize it completely. In our studies, <italic>ahpC</italic> expression was induced at 10hpi, and adequate enzyme levels may not have been sustained later during the developmental cycle. Consistent with studies in other bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Sherman et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Zuo et al., 2014</xref>), overexpression of <italic>ahpC</italic> created resistance to different oxidants (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> and S3), indicating that AhpC is the principal defense mechanism against oxidative stress in <italic>Chlamydia</italic>. During <italic>ahpC</italic> knockdown, the attenuated activity of AhpC severely affected the growth of bacteria (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). Notably, the morphology of inclusions during <italic>ahpC</italic> knockdown is strikingly similar to <italic>Chlamydia</italic> treated with a high concentration (1 mM) of oxidizing agents (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> and Fig S2), indicating similar scenarios in both conditions. This was further supported by the increased sensitivity of <italic>ahpC</italic> knockdown to sublethal concentrations of oxidants (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> and S4). Again, this observation is consistent with previous data from other bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Cosgrove et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Seaver &amp; Imlay, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Storz et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>).</p>
<p>An essential aspect of the scavenging activity of AhpC for many bacterial pathogens in which it has been studied is that it works best with endogenous (i.e., low) levels of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. These bacteria, such as <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> and <italic>Yersinia pseudotuberculosis</italic>, encode catalases, which have high Km for hydrogen peroxide and serve a predominant role in scavenging exogenous H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Cosgrove et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Wan et al., 2021</xref>). Catalases can detoxify H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> at high levels (millimolar levels) and are crucial in responding to external H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Mishra &amp; Imlay, 2012</xref>). The <italic>ahpC</italic> mutants in these bacteria became sensitive to organic peroxides but resistant to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> due to higher catalase activity as a compensatory response to the lack of AhpC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Antelmann et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Mongkolsuk et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Ochsner et al., 2000</xref>). Further, simultaneous mutations in both catalase and <italic>ahpC</italic> displayed drastically enhanced sensitivity to all oxidizing agents tested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Cosgrove et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Ezraty et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Seaver &amp; Imlay, 2001</xref>). <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> does not encode a catalase gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Boncompain et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Rusconi &amp; Greub, 2013</xref>), and hypersensitivity of <italic>ahpC</italic> knockdown to both inorganic and organic peroxides indicates the absence of catalase and establishes that AhpC is the primary scavenger of ROS in <italic>C. trachomatis</italic>. We did not observe significant effects of PN with AhpC expression. One possible explanation may be our study’s concentration (1 mM) of PN. Higher concentrations of PN could not be used due to toxic effects on the host cell. The other possibility may be the presence of some other unknown mechanism(s) to detoxify PN. For example, <italic>Chlamydia</italic> also encodes a superoxide dismutase (SOD) that may prevent the accumulation of the necessary precursors that are needed for PN production. We are currently investigating the function of the chlamydial SOD enzyme.</p>
<p>Previous studies in other bacterial systems indicated that ROS production significantly increased after the deletion of <italic>ahpC</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>). Similarly, in <italic>Chlamydia</italic> during <italic>ahpC</italic> knockdown, the ROS level was dramatically higher. Its ability to dissipate ROS produced by exogenous oxidative stress was severely compromised (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E</xref>). Further, the addition of ROS scavengers to the culture medium rescued the negative phenotypes associated with <italic>ahpC</italic> knockdown (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6G and H</xref>). This strongly suggests that, in the absence of AhpC, higher amounts of reactive oxygen species accumulate in <italic>Chlamydia</italic> and that the negative impact on growth during <italic>ahpC</italic> knockdown is due to highly oxidized conditions in the organism. Moreover, for the complete restoration of inclusion size, multiple doses of scavengers were required throughout the experiment, further emphasizing that the internal chlamydial environment is oxidized and/or susceptible to oxidation in the absence of AhpC. These findings suggest that AhpC in <italic>Chlamydia</italic> is indispensable, having a functional role even more extensive than previously reported in other bacteria.</p>
<p>Interestingly, in our RT-qPCR study, late-cycle genes such as <italic>hctA</italic>, <italic>hctB</italic>, <italic>glgA, omcB</italic>, and <italic>tsp</italic> are expressed at a higher level at an earlier time (14 hpi) in the chlamydial developmental cycle as a result of reduced AhpC activity (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>). Notably, in the developmental cycle of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>trachomatis</italic>, only RBs are present at 14 hpi, and secondary differentiation starts after 16 hpi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Abdelrahman &amp; Belland, 2005</xref>). Expression of most of the late-cycle genes occurs after this time in the developmental cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Belland et al., 2003</xref>). Among the tested late-cycle genes, <italic>hctA</italic> and <italic>hctB</italic> encode histone-like proteins responsible for chromosomal condensation during the differentiation of RBs into EBs. The <italic>hctA</italic> gene is among the first to be transcribed in the late-stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Chiarelli et al., 2020</xref>). The other three late genes, <italic>tsp</italic>, <italic>omcB</italic>, and <italic>glgA</italic>, are all well-characterized late genes associated with secondary differentiation. Tsp is a periplasmic protease thought to be crucial in the degradation of RB-specific periplasmic proteins during secondary differentiation in <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Swoboda et al., 2023</xref>). OmcB is responsible for the rigid cell wall and osmotic stability of the EBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Mygind et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Newhall, 1987</xref>). GlgA is a non-essential secretory protein involved in glycogen metabolism and is responsible for glycogen accumulation in the inclusion lumen at late stages of the developmental cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Gehre et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Sun et al., 2020</xref>). One crucial point to consider is the redox status of <italic>Chlamydia</italic>. 14 hpi is when reduced RBs predominate with virtually no oxidized EBs detectable. However, we established that <italic>ahpC</italic> knockdown shifts the redox status of the bacteria towards oxidation. Hence, the earlier and significantly higher detection of transcripts for these late-cycle genes indicate earlier secondary differentiation in the <italic>ahpC</italic> knockdown. Importantly, <italic>ahpC</italic> complementation during knockdown restored the regular developmental expression of these late-cycle genes, further supporting this phenotype was due to the highly oxidized conditions created by reduced AhpC activity.</p>
<p>The higher expression of genes functionally related to EBs and EB production at an early stage of the chlamydial developmental cycle indicates earlier secondary differentiation as an outcome of diminished activity of <italic>ahpC</italic> in <italic>C. trachomatis</italic>. Consequently, increased late gene transcription should have the phenotypic effect of causing earlier production of EBs. Indeed, we quantified more IFUs (proxy for EBs) in the <italic>ahpC</italic> knockdown at 16 and 18 hpi compared to the uninduced control condition. In contrast, for the AhpC overexpression strain, the expression of these late-cycle genes in the induced conditions compared to the uninduced control at 24 hpi is significantly lower, indicating reduced production of EBs. These data support our hypothesis that the developmental cycle is delayed in the reduced environment. We propose a simple model to explain these scenarios (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>). During <italic>ahpC</italic> KD, higher amounts of ROS accumulation in the bacterium create highly oxidized conditions. As secondary differentiation is asynchronous and RBs divide through an asymmetric budding mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Ouellette et al., 2020</xref>), ROS levels are unevenly distributed between mother and daughter cell. This difference will lead some RBs to breach an oxidative threshold sooner, allowing activation of late genes and secondary differentiation earlier than other RBs. In contrast, <italic>ahpC</italic> overexpression scavenges ROS at a greater level leading to a more reducing environment. This results in a delay in achieving the oxidative threshold, thus allowing RBs to continue to divide before committing to secondary differentiation. Taken together, our data directly link oxidation state and secondary differentiation in <italic>Chlamydia</italic>. Ongoing studies are focused on characterizing redox-sensitive chlamydial proteins to understand which specific factors drive the shift from RBs to EBs (or EBs to RBs) in <italic>C. trachomatis</italic>.</p>

<p>For chlamydial transformation, McCoy mouse fibroblast cells (kind gift of Dr. Harlan Caldwell (NIH/NIAID)) were used. Human cervix adenocarcinoma epithelial HeLa cells (kind gift of Dr. Harlan Caldwell (NIH/NIAID)) were used for RT-qPCR, immunofluorescence assays (IFA), inclusion forming unit assays (IFU), viability assays, oxidative stress, ROS measurements, and ROS scavenger assays. Both cell types were routinely grown and passaged in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM; Gibco, Waltham, MA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Sigma, St. Louis, MO) and 10 µg/mL gentamicin (Gibco, Waltham, MA) at 37<sup>0</sup>C and 5% CO2. All strains were verified to be Mycoplasma-negative using LookOut mycoplasma PCR detection kit (Sigma).

<title>Plasmid construction</title>
<p>The primers, gBlock gene fragments, plasmids, and bacterial strains used for molecular cloning are listed in Table S1 in the supplemental material. Constructs for chlamydial transformation were cloned using high-fidelity (HiFi) cloning system from New England BioLabs (NEB). Primers were designed using the NEBuilder online primer generation tool (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://nebuilderv1.neb.com">https://nebuilderv1.neb.com</ext-link>). For the overexpression strain, the <italic>ahpC</italic> gene was amplified by PCR with Phusion DNA polymerase (NEB) using <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> serovar L2 434/Bu genomic DNA as a template. The PCR product was purified using a PCR purification kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). The HiFi assembly reaction was performed as per the manufacturer’s instructions in conjunction with the pBOMBDC plasmid digested with Fast Digest EagI and KpnI enzymes and dephosphorylated with FastAP (Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA). The HiFi reaction mix was transformed into <italic>E. coli</italic> 10β (NEB). Plasmids were first confirmed by restriction enzyme digestion, and final verification of insert was performed using Sanger sequencing. A dCas12-based CRISPRi approach was used for <italic>ahpC</italic> knockdown generation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Ouellette et al., 2021</xref>). The pBOMBL12CRia plasmid having anhydrotetracycline (aTc) inducible catalytically dead dCas12 protein was used as vector. A crRNA targeting the 5’ intergenic region of <italic>ahpC</italic> was designed and ordered as a presynthesized DNA fragment. For <italic>ahpC</italic> knockdown construct, 2 ng of the gBlock (Integrated DNA Technologies [IDT], Coralville, IA) listed in Table S1 was combined with 25 ng of BamHI-digested, alkaline phosphatase-treated pBOMBL12CRia(e.v.)::L2 in a HiFi reaction according to the manufacturer’s instructions (NEB). The plasmid was transformed into NEB 10β cells and verified by Sanger sequencing prior to transformation into <italic>Chlamydia trachomatis</italic>. To generate the complementation strain, the <italic>ahpC</italic> gene was amplified using primers listed in Table S1 and fused with the <italic>ahpC</italic> knockdown construct (i.e., pBOMBL12CRia (<italic>ahpC</italic>)) digested with the Fast Digest restriction enzyme SalI (Thermo Fisher) and alkaline phosphatase-treated, using the HiFi reaction as mentioned above.</p>

<title>Chlamydial transformation</title>
<p>Chlamydial transformations were performed using a protocol described previously, with some modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Mueller et al., 2017</xref>). One day before transformation, 1 x 10<sup>6</sup> McCoy cells were seeded in one 6-well plate, and two wells were used per plasmid transformation. Briefly, for each well of the 6-well plate, 2 µg of sequenced verified plasmids were incubated with 2.5 x 10<sup>6</sup> <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> serovar L2 without plasmid (-pL2) EBs in 50 µL Tris-CaCl<sub>2</sub> (10 mM Tris, 50 mM CaCl2, pH 7.4) at room temperature for 30 min. McCoy cells were washed with 2 mL Hank’s Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS; Gibco), and 1 mL HBSS was added back into each well. 1 mL of HBSS was added to each transformant mixture, and one well of a 6-well plate was infected using this transformation solution. Cells were centrifuged at 400 × g for 15 min at room temperature followed by 15 min incubation at 37°C. HBSS was aspirated and replaced with antibiotic-free DMEM. At 8 hpi, 1 µg/mL of cycloheximide and 1 or 2 U/mL of penicillin G or 500 μg/mL spectinomycin were added to the culture media. The infection was passaged every 48 h until a population of penicillin or spectinomycin resistant, green fluorescent protein (GFP) positive <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> was established. The chlamydial transformants were then serially diluted to isolate clonal populations. These isolated populations were further expanded and frozen at - 80<sup>0</sup>C in a sucrose phosphate solution (2SP). To verify plasmid sequences, DNA was harvested from infected cultures using the DNeasy kit (Qiagen) and transformed into NEB 10β for plasmid propagation. Isolated plasmids were then verified by restriction digest and Sanger sequencing.</p>

At 24 and 48 hpi, samples were harvested by scraping three wells of a 24-well plate in 2 sucrose-phosphate (2SP) solution and lysed via a single freeze-thaw cycle, serially diluted, and used to infect a fresh HeLa cell monolayer and allowed to grow for 24 h. Samples were fixed with methanol, stained with a goat antibody specific to <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> major outer membrane protein (MOMP; Meridian Biosciences, Memphis TN) followed by staining with donkey antigoat Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated secondary antibody (Invitrogen) and titers were enumerated using a 20x lens objective.

<p>HeLa cells were seeded in 6-well tissue culture plates, infected with the <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> transformants, and induced or not at 10 hpi with 1 nM aTc. For each condition, triplicate wells were used for simultaneous harvest of RNA (for transcript analysis by RT-qPCR), gDNA (to normalize RT-qPCR data and quantification of gDNA), and IFA (to verify the morphological changes in samples in the tested conditions). For RNA extraction, cells were rinsed with DPBS twice and lysed with 1 mL TRIzol (Invitrogen/Thermo Fisher) per well as per manufacturer’s instructions. 200 μL of chloroform was added to extract the aqueous layer containing total RNA, which was precipitated with isopropanol. A total of 10 µg of purified RNA was treated with TURBO DNase (Invitrogen/Thermo Fisher) according to the manufacturer’s instructions to remove DNA contamination. DNA-free RNA was used for cDNA synthesis using random nonamers (N9; NEB) and SuperScript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen/Thermo Fisher) following the manufacturer’s instructions. cDNA samples were diluted 10-fold with molecular biology-grade water and stored at -80°C. A total of 2.5 µL of each diluted cDNA sample was used per well of a 96-well qPCR plate. For each of three biological replicates, each sample was analyzed in triplicate on a QuantStudio 3 system (Applied Biosystems/Thermo Fisher) using the standard amplification cycle with melting curve analysis. For gDNA, one well of a 6-well plate per condition was scraped in 500 μL DPBS, split in half (i.e., 250 μL), and frozen at -80°C. Each sample was then thawed and frozen twice more for a total of three freeze/thaw cycles, and gDNA was extracted using the DNeasy DNA extraction kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s guidelines. The isolated gDNA was quantified and diluted down to 5 ng/mL prior to use in quantitative PCR (qPCR). A total of 2.5 µL of each diluted gDNA sample was mixed with 10 µL of PowerUp SYBR green master mix in a 96-well qPCR plate and was analyzed on a QuantStudio 3 system (Applied Biosystems). Each sample from each biological replicate was tested in triplicate. For each primer set used, a standard curve of gDNA was generated against purified <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> L2 genomic DNA, and the cDNA levels were normalized to gDNA levels or 16S rRNA for analysis.

<body>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Chlamydia spp. has a biphasic developmental cycle consisting of an extracellular, infectious form called an elementary body (EB) and an intracellular, replicative form known as a reticular body (RB). The structural stability of EBs is maintained by extensive cross-linking of outer membrane proteins while the outer membrane proteins of RBs are in a reduced state. The overall redox state of EBs is more oxidized than RBs. The authors propose that the redox state may be a controlling factor in the developmental cycle. To test this, alkyl hydroperoxide reductase subunit C (ahpC) was overexpressed or knocked down to examine effects on developmental gene expression. KD of ahpC induced increased expression of EB-specific genes and accelerated EB production. Conversely, overexpression of phpC delayed differentiation to EBs. The results suggest that chlamydial redox state may play a role in differentiation.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Uses modern genetic tools to explore the difficult area of temporal gene expression throughout the chlamydial developmental cycle.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The environmental signals triggering ahpC expression/activity are not determined.</p>

<p>The factors that influence the differentiation of EBs and RBs during Chlamydial development are not clearly understood. A previous study had shown a redox oscillation during the Chlamydial developmental cycle. Based on this observation, the authors hypothesize that the bacterial redox state may play a role in regulating the differentiation in Chlamydia. To test their hypothesis, they make knock-down and overexpression strains of the major ROS regulator, ahpC. They show that the knock-down of ahpC leads to a significant increase in ROS levels leading to an increase in the production of elementary bodies and overexpression leads to a decrease in EB production likely caused by a decrease in oxidation. From their observations, they present an interesting model wherein an increase in oxidation favors the production of EBs.</p>
<p>Major concern:</p>
<p>In the absence of proper redox potential measurements, it is not clear if what they observe is a general oxidative stress response, especially when the knock-down of ahpC leads to a significant increase in ROS levels. Direct redox potential measurement in the ahpC overexpression and knock-down cells is required to support the model. This can be done using the roGFP-based measurements mentioned in the Wang et al. 2014 study cited by the authors.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The study reports clearly on the role of the AhpC protein as an antioxidant factor in Chlamydia trachomatis and speculates on the role of AhpC as an indirect regulator of developmental transcription induced by redox stress in this differentiating obligate intracellular bacterium.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The question posed and the concluding model about redox-dependent differentiation in chlamydia is interesting and highly relevant. This work fits with other propositions in which redox changes have been reported during bacterial developmental cycles, potentially as triggers, but have not been cited (examples PMID: 2865432, PMID: 32090198, PMID: 26063575). Here, AhpC over-expression is shown to protect Chlamydia towards redox stress imposed by H2O2, CHP, TBHP, and PN, while CRISPRi-mediated depletion of AhpC curbed intracellular replication and resulted in increased ROS levels and sensitivity to oxidizing agents. Importantly, the addition of ROS scavengers mitigated the growth defect caused by AhpC depletion. These results clearly establish the role of AhpC affects the redox state and growth in Ct (with the complicated KO genetics and complementation that are very nicely done).</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>However, with respect to the most important implication and claims of this work, the role of redox in controlling the chlamydial developmental cycle rather than simply being a correlation/passenger effect, I am less convinced about the impact of this work. First, the study is largely observational and does not resolve how this redox control of the cell cycle could be achieved, whereas in the case of Caulobacter, a clear molecular link between DNA replication and redox has been proposed. How would progressive oxidation in RBs eventually trigger the secondary developmental genes to induce EB differentiation? Is there an OxyR homolog that could elicit this change and why would the oxidation stress in RBs gradually accumulate during growth despite the presence of AhpC? In other words, the role of AhpC is simply to delay or dampen the redox stress response until the trigger kicks in, again, what is the trigger? Is this caused by increasing oxidative respiration of RBs in the inclusion? But what determines the redox threshold?</p>
<p>I also find the experiment with Pen treatment to have little predictive power. The fact that transcription just proceeds when division is blocked is not unprecedented. This also happens during the Caulobacter cell cycle when FtsZ is depleted for most developmental genes, except for those that are activated upon completion of the asymmetric cell division and that is dependent on the completion of compartmentalization. This is a smaller subset of developmental genes in caulobacter, but if there is a similar subset that depends on division on chlamydia and if these are affected by redox as well, then the argument about the interplay between developmental transcription and redox becomes much stronger and the link more intriguing. Another possibility to strengthen the study is to show that redox-regulated genes are under the direct control of chlamydial developmental regulators such as Euo, HctA, or others and at least show dual regulation by these inputs -perhaps the feed occurs through the same path.</p>
<p>This redox-transcription shortcoming is also reflected in the discussion where most are about the effects and molecular mitigation of redox stress in various systems, but there is little discussion on its link with developmental transcription in bacteria in general and chlamydia.</p>
