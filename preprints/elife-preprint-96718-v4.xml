<title>Abstract</title><p>Synchronous neuronal ensembles play a pivotal role in the consolidation of long-term memory in the hippocampus. However, their organization during the acquisition of spatial memory remains less clear. In this study, we used neuronal population voltage imaging to investigate the synchronization patterns of CA1 pyramidal neuronal ensembles during the exploration of a new environment, a critical phase for spatial memory acquisition. We found synchronous ensembles comprising approximately 40% of CA1 pyramidal neurons, firing simultaneously in brief windows (∼25ms) during immobility and locomotion in novel exploration. Notably, these synchronous ensembles were not associated with contralateral ripple oscillations but were instead phase-locked to theta waves recorded in the contralateral CA1 region. Moreover, the subthreshold membrane potentials of neurons exhibited coherent intracellular theta oscillations with a depolarizing peak at the moment of synchrony. Among newly formed place cells, pairs with more robust synchronization during locomotion displayed more distinct place-specific activities. These findings underscore the role of synchronous ensembles in coordinating place cells of different place fields.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The establishment of long-term memory involves the initial acquisition and subsequent consolidation of memory traces, processes intricately connected to the modification of synaptic transmission<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. Synchronous ensembles, characterized by the simultaneous firing of multiple neurons over tens of milliseconds (referred to as population synchrony), play a pivotal role in influencing synaptic plasticity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. The hippocampus, a crucial region for long-term memory formation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>, has been a focal point of synchronous ensemble studies. Within the hippocampus, synchronous ensembles are hypothesized to play roles in reactivating and consolidating labile memory traces<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. However, their organization during memory acquisition remains less understood.</p>
<p>In the hippocampus, synchronous ensembles among CA1 pyramidal cells (CA1PCs) are predominantly observed during sharp-wave ripples, the brain waves associated with memory consolidation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. During these events, 10-18% of CA1PCs generate spikes, particularly during offline consummatory behavioral states or sleep<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. These synchronous ensembles are biased toward experience-dependent reactivation, consolidating labile memory traces<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. Furthermore, synchronous ensembles firing action potentials in short windows of 10-30 milliseconds enhance information processing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup> and discriminate distinct behavioral contingencies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. Although synchronous ensembles of CA1PCs during offline memory consolidation are well-characterized, their organization during online acquisition of spatial memory, such as when animals enter a new environment and new place cells form, remains unclear.</p>
<p>Previous studies have identified correlated activities among place cells during theta oscillation, where 1-3% of place cells’ spikes co-activate in a forward order matching animals’ trajectory in the theta cycles when animals’ locations overlap in the place fields of these cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. Because these place cells fire at distinct theta phases in the same cycle, this coordinated firing operates on the timescale of theta periods (∼125ms)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>. Population synchrony on shorter timescales (10-30 ms) is speculated to be reduced by the presence of theta oscillations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>The subthreshold membrane voltage (subVm), influenced by synaptic inputs and intrinsic conductances, directly triggers spiking activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>. Additionally, properties of subVm support the organization of neuronal representation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>. Although correlated membrane potentials have been proposed to underlie the synchrony of neuronal ensembles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>, multicellular recordings of subVms have not yet provided direct experimental evidence. Given the intricate interaction among subVm, spiking, and place cell formation, it is crucial to investigate the temporal relationships of sub- and suprathreshold neuronal activities among CA1PCs during novel exploration.</p>
<p>In this study, we used voltage imaging to investigate the temporal dynamics of sub- and suprathreshold neuronal activities in CA1PCs during novel exploration. Additionally, we implanted electrodes in the contralateral CA1 region to monitor theta and ripple oscillations, which are known to co-occur across hemispheres<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>. We found synchronous ensembles involving approximately 40% of CA1PCs exhibited transient population synchrony and correlated subthreshold membrane potentials when mice ran and stopped in a new maze. Surprisingly, these synchronous ensembles occurred outside of contralateral ripples and were phase-locked to intracellular theta oscillations as well as extracellular theta oscillations recorded from the contralateral CA1 region. Notably, cell pairs with stronger synchronous activities established more distinct place fields that overlapped less. In essence, synchronous ensembles facilitated temporal association among place cells representing diverse features of spatial memory. This plastic network, driven by synchronous ensembles, may contribute to the stabilization of place cells, establishing place fields that effectively tile the environment.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>To investigate the temporal relationships between neuronal activities during novel exploration, we simultaneously recorded many neurons as animals explored a new environment for the first time. To achieve this, we employed voltage imaging in conjunction with an air-lifted plastic track that allowed mice to explore an environment while remaining head-fixed under a microscope (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). To ensure a genuinely novel experience, all pre-training and habituation were performed in a separate room distinct from the one where the imaging experiments were conducted. On the day of imaging, the mice were introduced to the recording room for the first time and initially confined to a specific corner of the track (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref> top view). Subsequently, as the imaging session commenced, the confinement was lifted, granting mice the freedom to explore the track while imaging was conducted.</p>

<p>In novel exploration, mice moved at a speed of 8.3±0.9 cm/s during locomotion (speed&gt;3 cm/s) and spent 53±7% and 36±6% of their time in locomotion and immobility (speed&lt;1 cm/s), respectively (n=5 mice). Meanwhile, they completed 10±2.5 laps during the 180-s imaging periods (n=5 mice).</p>
<p>For voltage imaging, we expressed the voltage indicator Voltron2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup> in CA1 pyramidal cells (CA1PCs) that were born on embryonic day (E) 14.5, allowing us to measure both suprathreshold and subthreshold membrane potentials from multiple CA1PCs (14±4 cells imaged per field of view (mean±s.d.) and, in total, 71 cells imaged from 5 fields of view in 5 mice; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 1A</xref>, <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">1B</xref>). Simultaneously, we monitored the animals’ positions and speed within the track while recording the local field potential (LFP) from the contralateral side of the hippocampus (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref rid="figs1-1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1-figure supplement 1</xref>). Consistent with previous studies, neurons labeled on E14.5 located more on the deep side of the pyramidal layer than those labeled on E17.5 (<italic>t</italic><sub>(601)</sub>=22.8, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.0001, Student’s <italic>t</italic>-test; <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 1C, D</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>The mean firing rates of cells ranged from 2.3 to 4.3 Hz (25<sup>th</sup>-75<sup>th</sup> percentiles) with a median of 3.2 Hz (n=71 cells, <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 2A</xref>). Additionally, most CA1PCs exhibited elevated mean firing rates during immobility relative to locomotion, and their firing rates showed a negative correlation with the animals’ speed (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 2B</xref>, <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">2C</xref>), consistent with previous research<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>.</p>

<title>Synchronous ensembles among many CA1 pyramidal neurons</title>
<p><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref> shows the fluorescence traces of all neurons in a session as an example. Instances of synchronous activity, where many neurons emitted spikes within a narrow time window, were frequently observed (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). To investigate synchronous activity within the neuronal population, we selected a reference cell and counted the number of spikes across all other cells that were aligned with the spikes of the reference cell. This approach yielded a grand average cross-correlogram (CCG) capable of elucidating the timing of spikes from the reference cell relative to the combined spikes of the rest of the population. Notably, the grand average CCG exhibited heightened spike counts around zero lags, unlike flattened counts calculated from randomly selected cells of different sessions (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1E</xref>). The full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the peak in the grand average CCG measured 23±14 ms (mean±s.d., n=71 cells from 5 sessions; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>), indicating the timescale of the population synchrony. Furthermore, pairwise CCGs of many cell pairs showed significant peaks compared to jittered data (percentage of significant pairs: 63% (median) n=497 pairs, <xref rid="figs1-2" ref-type="fig">Figure 1-figure supplement 2A</xref> and <xref rid="figs1-2" ref-type="fig">2B</xref>). Among pairs with significant peaks, the absolute values of the peak lags ranged from 0.8 to 4.3 ms (25<sup>th</sup>-75<sup>th</sup> percentiles) with a median of 2.1 ms, and the FWHM of the peaks ranged from 20 to 46 ms (25<sup>th</sup>-75<sup>th</sup> percentiles) with a median of 30 ms (n=315 pairs, <xref rid="figs1-2" ref-type="fig">Figure 1-figure supplement 2C</xref> and <xref rid="figs1-2" ref-type="fig">2D</xref>). These results highlight the synchronous spiking between neurons on the millisecond timescale.</p>
<p>To systematically reveal individual synchronous events, we counted the number of spikes from all simultaneously recorded neurons within sliding windows of 25 ms. To compare the summed spikes with controls, we randomly jittered the spike trains to perturb spike timings while maintaining spike rates. We identified moments of population synchrony when spike sums exceeded the average of the jittered spike sums plus four standard deviations (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). Using the same criterion for event detection, we observed over a 7.8-fold increase in synchronous events in the original data compared to jittered controls (mean event rate: 0.94±0.17 Hz for the original data, 0.12±0.01 Hz for the jittered data, <italic>n</italic>=10 segments, <italic>p</italic>=0.002, <italic>W</italic>=55, Wilcoxon signed-rank test; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G</xref>). The observed population synchrony was not attributable to spikes in complex bursts, as synchronous event rates did not differ significantly with or without the inclusion of later spikes in bursts (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 3</xref>). Furthermore, we calculated the percentage of neurons participating in these synchronous events to examine the synchronous ensemble sizes. The ensemble sizes ranged from 32% to 53% (25<sup>th</sup>-75<sup>th</sup> percentiles) with a median of 42%, which were larger than the synchronous ensemble sizes associated with ripples<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1H</xref>). These results demonstrate synchronous ensembles of CA1PCs engaging many neurons.</p>

<title>Synchronous ensembles during locomotion and immobility of novel exploration</title>
<p>The hippocampus exhibits state-dependent activities when rodents are engaged in locomotion and immobility<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>. In novel exploration, CA1PCs showed synchronous spiking during locomotion and immobility (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). To investigate whether these synchronous activities differed between these behavioral states, we compared grant average CCGs and synchronous ensembles under these conditions. During both immobility and locomotion, grant average CCGs showed prominent peaks compared to jittered data (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). Moreover, synchronous ensembles were rich in both immobility and locomotion periods (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2B</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2D</xref>).

Synchronous events occurred more frequently during immobility compared to locomotion (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>). Additionally, ensemble sizes were significantly larger in the immobility group compared to the locomotion group (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>). Taken together, with differences in sizes and kinetics, there were synchronous ensembles during both immobility and locomotion periods of novel exploration.</p>

<title>Synchronous ensembles occur outside ripple episodes</title>
<p>CA1PCs exhibit synchronous activities when the hippocampal network emits ripple waves<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>. To test whether there is a co-occurrence of synchronous ensembles and contralateral ripples, we first detected ripples from LFP recordings. Ripples were detected in three of the five recording sessions, and all occurred during immobility (mean ripple rate: 0.04±0.02 Hz during immobility, 0 Hz during locomotion). In the two recording sessions where we did not detect any ripples, we verified the recording quality of the LFP signal by running multiple tests after the recording sessions. Ripples were identified in the same animals during quality tests, indicating that the absence of ripples during novel immobility in the recording session was not due to the deterioration of LFP recordings (<xref rid="figs3-1" ref-type="fig">Figure 3-figure supplement 1</xref>).</p>

<p>To visualize both ripples and synchronous ensembles, we plotted voltage traces of neurons alongside simultaneously recorded ripple oscillations. It was typical for synchronous ensembles to occur far away from ripple episodes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). To delve into the relationship between neuronal activities and ripples, we aligned traces of ripple power with population synchrony and ripples. In a recording session where 64 synchronous ensembles and 12 ripples were detected during immobility, the LFP power at ripple frequency (120-240 Hz) exhibited no discernable peaks within any of the synchronous events (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>, left upper and middle panels). Nevertheless, the same LFP power displayed substantial peaks during every ripple event (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>, right upper and middle panels). A striking contrast between synchronous events and ripples was also evident when spiking probabilities during these events were examined. During population synchrony, the mean spiking probability averaged across all cells was high, while the spiking probability was almost zero during ripple events (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref> lower panel). In the three sessions where ripples were identified, we calculated the percentages of ripple events coinciding with synchronous ensembles and vice versa. Remarkably, there was no co-occurrence of ripples and synchronous ensembles (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>). Furthermore, we quantified ripple-modulated spiking by calculating the ratio of the difference in mean firing rates during in-ripple and out-ripple periods to the sum of the mean firing rates during both periods. Indexes of most cells were negative, and a striking 85% of cells displayed ripple modulation indexes of -1, indicating complete suppression of their spiking activities during ripples (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>). Taken together, during novel exploration, synchronous ensembles involved many neurons with millisecond-synchronized spikes and occurred outside the time frames of ripples.</p>
<p>It was puzzling that these CA1PCs exhibited robust spiking activities outside of ripples yet generated few spikes during ripples. To further investigate neuronal activities during ripples, we established a recording condition that allowed us to capture more ripple episodes. Specifically, we immobilized mice in a tube to promote behaviors favoring ripple generation. The mice were habituated to head fixation in a tube in a room distinct from the one where imaging experiments were conducted. On the imaging day, the mice were introduced to the recording room and head-fixed under the microscope for the first time.</p>
<p>CA1PCs were labeled <italic>in utero</italic> on embryonic day (E) 14.5 (<italic>n</italic>=56 cells from 3 sessions in 3 mice) and E17.5 (<italic>n</italic>=55 cells from 3 sessions in 3 mice) and imaged in adult brains. Both neuronal populations exhibited prominent peaks in their grand average CCGs and significantly higher synchronous event rates compared to jittered data (<xref rid="figs3-2" ref-type="fig">Figure 3-figure supplement 2A, B</xref>). Approximately 40% of the recorded neurons participated in synchronous ensembles, indicating robust synchronous activity involving a substantial proportion of the recorded cells (<xref rid="figs3-2" ref-type="fig">Figure 3-figure supplement 2C</xref>).</p>
<p>In total, 1052 synchronous ensembles and 174 ripple episodes were detected across these imaging sessions. Consistent with findings from walking animals, few synchronous ensembles occurred during ripples when animals were immobilized in a tube (<xref rid="figs3-3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3-figure supplement 3A, B</xref>). Moreover, no distinguishable ripple oscillations were observed in synchronous events, and the average firing rates during ripple episodes were near zero (<xref rid="figs3-3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3-figure supplement 3C, D</xref>). At the single-cell level, 90% of neurons showed significant negative spiking modulation during ripples, with ripple modulation indexes close to -1, indicating strong suppression of spiking (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4Ai</xref>). This suppression extended to subthreshold membrane potentials, as nearly all cells exhibited decreased fluorescence during ripples compared to baseline (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4Bi, Ci</xref>). These results demonstrate that spiking activity and subthreshold membrane potentials are robustly suppressed during ripples.</p>

<p>Contextual novelty plays a critical role in shaping hippocampal neuronal activities<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup>. To assess its influence, we trained mice to become familiar with the imaging procedure and the recording environment over five days and recorded CA1PC activities on the final day. Mean firing rates were significantly reduced in the familiar group compared to the novel group (Familiar group: 1.1 to 5.2 Hz (25<sup>th</sup>-75<sup>th</sup> percentiles), median=2.3 Hz, <italic>n</italic>=66 cells, 6 sessions, 4 mice; Novel group: 1.7 to 6.0 Hz (25<sup>th</sup>-75<sup>th</sup> percentiles), median=4.2 Hz, <italic>n</italic>=111 cells, 6 sessions, 6 mice, <italic>p</italic>=0.0083, Wilcoxon signed-rank test). Additionally, 15% of the neurons in the familiar group exhibited significantly positive spiking modulation by ripples, while fewer cells showed negative modulation compared to the novel group (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). During ripples, neurons in the novel group predominantly displayed hyperpolarizing membrane voltage responses, whereas a subset of neurons in the familiar group exhibited prominent depolarizing responses (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>). The mean fluorescence changes in the familiar group shifted toward depolarization compared to the novel group (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>). Finally, synchronous event frequencies were significantly lower in the familiar context, indicating weaker synchronous activities under familiar conditions (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>). These results demonstrate that hippocampal neuronal activities, particularly synchronous ensembles, are strongly influenced by contextual novelty.</p>

<title>Synchronous ensembles are associated with theta oscillations</title>
<p>To compare the network dynamics associated with synchronous ensembles during immobility and locomotion, we aligned LFP traces triggered to the timings of synchronous ensembles. The average LFP traces of a representative session showed prominent theta oscillations around the timings of both immobility and locomotion population synchrony (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). Spectral analysis of the mean synchrony-triggered LFP traces during immobility and locomotion revealed theta frequency components of 4-12 Hz, with a slightly higher peak frequency in locomotion LFP compared to immobility LFP (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>). Furthermore, we computed LFP theta modulation and identified preferred phases of synchronous ensembles. In line with the previous result, synchronous ensembles displayed a high level of modulation by LFP theta oscillation (modulation strength: 0.61± 0.05 during immobility and 0.74±0.04 during locomotion, n=5 sessions). Although the preferred phases varied from session to session due to differences in recording sites along the proximal-distal axis of the hippocampus, the timings of individual ensembles were consistently locked to the preferred phase of each session (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>). These results establish a strong link between synchronous ensembles and LFP theta oscillation.</p>

<p>Subthreshold membrane voltage (subVm) is one of the critical parameters supporting the generation of action potentials. To investigate the subthreshold signals underlying population synchrony, we aligned subVm traces with the timings of synchronous ensembles and observed that both immobility and locomotion synchrony rode on a subVm waveform oscillating at theta frequency (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>). To elucidate further the relationship between subVm theta oscillation and spikes involved in population synchrony, we calculated the subVm theta modulation and preferred phases of spikes. Spikes participating in both immobility and locomotion synchrony were strongly coupled to the subVm theta oscillation of neurons, with the mean preferred phase being in the latter half of the rising phase closer to subVm theta peaks (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref>). Conversely, spikes not participating in synchronous ensembles had weaker modulation strength compared to spikes involved in synchrony (<xref rid="figs5-1" ref-type="fig">Figure 5-figure supplement 1A, B</xref>). Furthermore, the membrane voltages triggered by these two categories of spikes showed a significant difference in the hyperpolarization phase of the theta oscillation. Synchronous spikes were situated within cycles of theta oscillations featuring more hyperpolarized troughs than spikes outside synchronous ensembles (<xref rid="figs5-1" ref-type="fig">Figure 5-figure supplement 1C, D</xref>). Thus, compared to spikes not participating in synchronous ensembles, synchronous spikes showed a more robust modulation by theta oscillation of membrane voltage during immobility and locomotion in the context of novel exploration.</p>
<p>Notably, phase locking of spikes to their subVm theta oscillation and the synchronous spikes among many neurons suggest that subVms of different neurons would be correlated at the theta frequency. To explore the possibility, we divided the 180-second subVm traces into 1-second segments with 50% overlap and calculated the cross-correlation and magnitude-squared coherence function for each pair of cell segments. Segments were sorted into the immobility or locomotion group based on the animals’ speed during each segment (kept below 1 cm/s for immobility and above 3 cm/s for locomotion for more than 90% of the time). In total, we analyzed 511 cell pairs from 5 sessions.</p>
<p>Indeed, the cross-correlation of subVm between cell pairs revealed a high correlation at zero lag and periodic modulation of the correlation at theta frequency (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5F</xref>). Furthermore, the subVm theta coherences were increased in both groups (immobility: 0.50, locomotion: 0.40, median, <italic>n</italic>=511 pairs) and were negatively correlated with soma distances (immobility: -0.46, locomotion: -0.48, <italic>n</italic>=511 pairs, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5G</xref>). Taken together, during novel exploration, CA1PCs generate synchronous activity associated with theta oscillation and exhibit correlated and theta-coherent subVms.</p>
<p>Correlated intracellular theta and theta-phase locking of the synchronous ensembles raise the question of whether population synchrony among CA1PCs extends beyond synchrony derived from these effects. To address this, we analyzed population synchrony after randomizing the theta cycles during which neurons spiked, while keeping their theta phases unchanged. <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 4</xref> illustrates a significant reduction in synchronous event rates following theta cycle randomization. The finding indicates spiking at specific theta cycles plays a major role in driving population synchrony.</p>
<p>To further investigate synchronous ensembles across different datasets, we analyzed publicly available hippocampal recordings ‘hc-11’ from the CRCNS repository<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup>, where rats navigated novel mazes for water rewards (see Method). Using our algorithm, we identified a significant number of synchronous ensembles during the first three minutes of novel navigation. On average, the rates of synchronous events were 6.4-fold higher than those detected in jittered controls (mean event rate: 2.0 ± 0.3 Hz for the original data vs. 0.32 ± 0.03 Hz for jittered data, <italic>n</italic> = 8 sessions, <italic>p</italic> = 0.0078, <italic>W</italic> = 36, Wilcoxon signed-rank test; <xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 5A</xref>). To assess whether ripple oscillations were associated with these synchronous ensembles, we analyzed ripple event rates and their relationship to population synchrony. During this period, ripple events were infrequent (mean ripple rate: 0.02 ± 0.01, <italic>n</italic> = 8 sessions), and ripple power peaked during ripple episodes but remained low at the timings of population synchrony (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 5B</xref>). Nevertheless, LFP traces aligned to population synchrony revealed prominent theta oscillations (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 5C</xref>).</p>
<p>Synchronous ensembles were modulated by LFP theta oscillation (modulation strength: 0.30 ± 0.04, <italic>n</italic> = 8 sessions, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001), and the timings of individual ensembles were consistently locked to the preferred phase of each session, suggesting a functional coupling of synchronous ensembles to theta oscillations important for information processing (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 5D</xref>).</p>

<title>Synchrony between place cells with distinct place tunings</title>
<p>When animals explore a novel maze, spatially tuned spiking activity can form within a few minutes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup>. However, how synchronous ensembles organize their spatially tuned activities during novel exploration remains to be determined. Synchronous ensembles, generating spikes coincidently in short intervals, might display correlated spiking at longer time windows that match behavioral timescales of exploration, potentially leading to shared place responses. On the other hand, CA1PCs are interconnected through inhibitory interneurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref></sup>.

<p>We further explored the relationship between the similarity of spatial tunings and synchronization strength among pairs of place cells.

We segregated spikes based on these behavioral states to accommodate differences between locomotion and immobility and calculated the corresponding CCG and synchronization strength.</p>
<p>During locomotion, we observed a robust negative correlation between synchronization strength and the similarity of spatial tunings among cell pairs. In other words, cell pairs with more precisely co-active spikes during locomotion exhibited more distinct place-tuning profiles (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C, D</xref>). This anti-correlation between synchronization strength and place tunings indicates coordination between place cells’ temporal and spatial coding. On the other hand, synchronization strength during immobility showed little correlation with the similarity of spatial tunings among place cell pairs, suggesting that correlated activities at the millisecond timescale do not extend to slow, behavioral-relevant timescales (Figure 6-figure supplement 1). Thus, place cells with distinct place fields are linked by synchronous activity during novel locomotion.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our findings reveal the presence of synchronous ensembles comprising a substantial number of CA1PCs during both locomotion and immobility in a novel environment. These ensembles concurrently engage neurons representing diverse aspects of the environment and are rarely observed during ripple events. Instead, they closely align with LFP and intracellular theta oscillations. Our data demonstrate theta-associated synchronous ensembles during spatial memory acquisition, coordinating numerous CA1 place cells that transmit information about different segments of the environment.</p>
<p>The correlation between observed population synchrony and theta oscillations is intriguing. Theta oscillations are typically associated with the sequential activation of neurons over time, resulting in reduced neuronal synchrony<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>. However, theta oscillations come in different types, each characterized by distinct pharmacological properties and behavioral correlates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref></sup>. For example, type 1 theta, or translational theta, occurs during voluntary movements and is sensitive to N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) blockers. On the other hand, type 2 theta, or attentional theta, is slightly slower and is blocked by muscarinic receptor antagonists, emerging during states of arousal or attention, such as when entering a new environment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref></sup>. Consistent with these distinctions, the peak of the power spectrum density shows a distinctively slower theta frequency during immobility compared to locomotion (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>).</p>
<p>During theta oscillations, cholinergic neurons in the medial septum excite downstream CA1PCs, leading to increased firing rates and membrane potentials<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref></sup>. Given the widespread influence of cholinergic inputs on numerous CA1PCs, theta-coupled cholinergic inputs may drive depolarization and firing across many CA1PCs. Additionally, they could enhance the likelihood of synchronicity.</p>
<p>Furthermore, GABAergic neurons in the medial septum, activated during theta oscillations, could activate interneurons in the CA1 region<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref></sup>. These CA1 interneurons, in turn, have the capability to entrain the activities of pyramidal neurons at both sub- and suprathreshold levels, thereby promoting synchronization among pyramidal neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref></sup>. In summary, cholinergic and GABAergic neuron activation during theta waves may contribute to the excitation of CA1PCs and the consequent increase in their synchronicity.</p>
<p>Theta oscillations have long been implicated in memory acquisition. Specifically, theta power correlates positively with learning performance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref></sup>. Perturbing generation of theta waves leads to impairment in memory acquisition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">76</xref></sup>, while electrical stimulation restoring theta rhythms rescues learning performance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">77</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">78</xref></sup>. Furthermore, increased spike-theta coherence correlates with better memory, and stimulations that boost theta phase-locking of spikes enhance memory<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">79</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">81</xref></sup>. Despite abundant evidence supporting a link between theta oscillations and memory, the precise network mechanism by which theta oscillations support memory acquisition remains unclear. Theta oscillations are hypothesized to link spatially distributed neurons into functional ensembles to support memory acquisition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. The identified synchronous ensembles support the hypothesis, providing a network substrate that links theta rhythms to the initial stage of memory acquisition.</p>
<p>Recent studies have demonstrated elevated coactivity of hippocampal principal cells during theta-associated dentate spikes, events that are temporally coupled to theta oscillations and distinct from sharp-wave ripples<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">82</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">84</xref></sup>. These findings highlight a network state characterized by rich synchronous ensembles associated with theta, but not ripple, oscillations-a pattern consistent with our results. Our analyses of publicly available data further support these observations, revealing theta-associated population synchrony in a different dataset (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 5</xref>). These results suggest that hippocampal neurons achieve synchrony through network mechanisms distinct from ripple-related events, reinforcing the hypothesis that this phenomenon is generalizable across experimental conditions and behavioral contexts.</p>
<p>Previous studies have reported that a small percentage of CA1PCs generate spikes during ripple episodes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. These measurements are typically conducted in familiar environments. In contrast, when animals are introduced to a novel environment, ripple-associated spiking activities are strongly suppressed, and CA1PCs exhibit prominent hyperpolarizing responses in their membrane potentials (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4Ai-Ci</xref>, and <xref rid="figs3-3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3-figure supplement 3</xref>). Interestingly, after familiarization training, a larger proportion of CA1PCs display positive ripple modulation of spiking activities and depolarizing responses associated with ripples (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4Aii-Cii</xref>). Consistent with the observation of ripple-associated spiking activity in familiar environments, our study underscores the influence of contextual novelty on hippocampal dynamics. Specifically, brain states associated with novelty may modulate the activity of neurons upstream of CA1PCs, driving their membrane potentials toward hyperpolarization during ripples. While the reduced correlation between ripples and spikes in novel environments may initially appear counterintuitive, this unique neuronal activity pattern likely reflects adaptive changes in hippocampal circuits related to the animals’ behavioral states, such as heightened vigilance in novel environments.</p>
<p>While contralateral LFP recordings reliably capture large-scale hippocampal theta and ripple oscillations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>, they may not fully account for ipsilateral-specific dynamics, such as variations in theta phase alignment or locally generated ripple events. Although contralateral recordings serve as a well-established proxy for large-scale hippocampal oscillatory states<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">85</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">87</xref></sup>, incorporating simultaneous ipsilateral field potential recordings in future studies could refine our understanding of local-global network interactions. Despite these considerations, our findings provide robust evidence for the existence of synchronous neuronal ensembles and their role in coordinating newly formed place cells. These results advance our understanding of how synchronous neuronal ensembles contribute to spatial memory acquisition and hippocampal network coordination.</p>
<p>Although CA1PCs are known to exhibit weaker recurrent connectivity than that of CA3 pyramidal neurons, CA1PCs did communicate through monosynaptic connections<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">88</xref></sup>. These connections can be dynamically adjusted by the spike-timing-dependent plasticity mechanism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">89</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">91</xref></sup>, and therefore could be affected by the transient population synchrony. In addition, CA1PCs are known to communicate through inhibitory interneurons. Multiple pyramidal neurons converge onto a single interneuron, and individual connections are often weak and unreliable<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c92">92</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93">93</xref></sup>. This connectivity scheme requires multiple pyramidal neurons spiking synchronously within the time window of synaptic integration to effectively activate postsynaptic neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></sup>. Furthermore, population synchrony among CA1PCs may propagate to downstream areas, synchronizing neurons outside the hippocampus. With their large ensemble sizes, these synchronous ensembles may synergistically convey relevant information or reorganize the connectivity of the neuronal networks.</p>
<p>Prior studies in sensory systems have commonly revealed that neurons with synchronous activities typically share similar sensory responses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c94">94</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c95">95</xref></sup>. However, the synchronous ensembles we have identified often encompass neurons with distinct preferences for place fields. Pairwise synchrony demonstrates a negative correlation with place field overlap (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>). These findings indicate that synchrony does not necessarily imply similar tunings between neurons. Furthermore, these synchronous ensembles involve place cells encoding different spatial information. Recognizing the crucial role of neuronal synchrony in binding distributed neurons in the brain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>, population synchrony may serve as a mechanism to integrate diverse features of the same environment into a cohesive mental map.</p>

<p>Time-pregnant wild-type C57BL/6J female mice underwent in utero virus injection of CamkII-cre virus (105558-AAV1, Addgene) into the left side of the lateral ventricles. The resulting offspring were raised in a breeding room under controlled temperature and humidity conditions and a 12-hour light/dark cycle (lights on from 7:00 to 19:00). The mice used in the experiments were between 12 and 18 weeks old at the time of the recordings. All surgical procedures, behavioral training, and recording protocols were approved by the NYCU Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.</p>

<title>In-utero virus injection</title>
<p>Time-pregnant mice on embryonic day 14.5 or 17.5 were anesthetized with isoflurane (induction:4-5%; maintenance:1-3%) before surgery. The animals were placed on a heating pad in a supine position to maintain body temperature. Aseptic procedures were implemented to maintain sterile conditions during the surgery. Uterine horns were exposed one at a time using spoons and fingers. Warm and sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) was used to rinse the uterus to prevent it from drying out. Micropipettes loaded with CamkII-cre virus solution were used to inject 0.2 <italic>μ</italic> L of virus suspension into the left side of the lateral ventricle of each embryo. The injection resulted in Cre expression among neurons born on the day of injection, with earlier injection labeling neurons located on the deeper side of the cell layer. The uterine horn was then gently returned to the abdominal cavity. The exact process was repeated to the other uterine horn. After the surgery, ketorolac (6mg/kg) and cefazolin (1g/kg) were administered for two days to minimize pain and inflammation.</p>

<title>Cranial window and cannula implantation</title>
<p>The offspring of the mice that had undergone in-utero injection were subjected to chronic hippocampal window surgery when they were between 2 and 4 months old. The animals were initially anesthetized using isoflurane (induction:4-5%; maintenance:1-3%). Topical anesthesia was applied by administering 0.5% lidocaine to the wound margins. After achieving deep anesthesia, an incision was made in the skin, and a circular section of the skull was removed, centered 2 mm caudal and 1.8 mm left to the bregma. Using 30-gauge needles and forceps, the dura was removed from the exposed area, and cortical tissue within the craniotomy was aspirated. A serial dilution experiment was conducted to determine an optimal titer of the virus carrying Voltron2 genes, minimizing cell toxicity, for use in this and in previous imaging experiments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>. A fine injection pipette (tip diameter 10-60 um) was used to inject AAV2/1-CAG-flex-Voltron2-ST (2.7×10<sup>12</sup> GC/ml, a generous gift from Dr. Eric Schreiter and the GENIE team at HHMI Janelia Research Campus) into the exposed regions at a depth of 200 <italic>μ</italic> m (up to six injection sites and 100-200 nL of viral suspension). An optical chamber was constructed by placing a cannula with a cover slip attached at the bottom over the craniotomy and sealing it with dental acrylic or C&amp;B Metabond (Sun Medical). A custom-built titanium frame was then cemented to the animal’s head using dental acrylic or C&amp;B Metabond. Mice received ketorolac (6mg/kg) and cefazolin (1g/kg) for two days following surgery to minimize pain and inflammation.</p>

<title>Behavioral training</title>
<p>After at least two weeks of recovery from the window surgery, the mice underwent behavioral training to ensure they were calm and attentive in the test environment. For mice subjected to imaging experiments where they explored an air-lifted plastic track, the initial training phase involved acclimating the mice to head fixation and treadmill running, which took place over 3-5 days in a separate room distinct from the recording setup. Following this training, the imaging experiments were conducted. On the day designated for imaging, the mice were introduced to the recording room for the first time just before the imaging session. During the imaging experiments, the mice were securely held in a head-fixed position beneath the microscope and on an air-lifted plastic track that rested on an air table (AirLift, Neurotar; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). The track was adorned with various shapes of signs to help the mice navigate the track. Subdued blue lighting was provided to illuminate the track. Before the initiation of imaging, the mice were confined in a corner of the track using gates. Subsequently, the gates were opened upon the start of imaging, allowing the mice to explore the new environment during their initial laps (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref> Top view). The Mobile HomeCage tracking system (Neurotar) was used to track the mice’s position and speed. During the acquisition of image frames, TTL pulses were sent by the high-speed camera to the Mobile HomeCage tracking system to facilitate data alignment. Mice subjected to imaging experiments with head fixation in a tube were first trained in a separate room, distinct from the recording setup, for 1-2 days to habituate them to the head fixation procedure. Following this training, the mice were introduced to the recording room for the first time immediately before the imaging session. During imaging, the mice were securely positioned in a head-fixation setup within an acrylic tube and remained stationary. To further familiarize the mice with the recording context, the imaging procedure was repeated for 4 days without injecting the JF-HaloTag ligand. On the fifth day, the JF-HaloTag ligand was injected prior to imaging, and voltage imaging was performed following the same procedure as in the previous sessions.</p>

<title>Voltage imaging</title>
<p>JF<sub>552</sub>-HaloTag ligand<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c96">96</xref></sup> (a generous gift from Dr. Luke Lavis) was first dissolved in DMSO (20 <italic>μ</italic> l, Sigma) and then diluted in Pluronic<sup>TM</sup> F-127 (20 <italic>μ</italic> l, P3000MP, Invitrogen) and PBS to achieve a final concentration of 0.83 mM of JF<sub>552</sub>-HaloTag ligand. The solution was then injected intravenously through the retro-orbital sinus. Imaging sessions were initiated 3 hours after the injection of the JF<sub>552</sub>-HaloTag ligand. Fluorescence sensors were excited using a 532-nm laser (Opus 532, Laser Quantum) with an excitation filter (FF02-520-28, Semrock), and the emitted light was separated from the excitation light using a dichroic mirror (540lpxr Chroma) and passed through an emission filter (FF01-596183 Semrock). A 16X, 0.8 NA objective (Nikon) was used to collect the emission light which was then imaged on a CMOS camera (DaVinci-1K, RedShirt) with a 50-mm camera lens (Nikkor 50mm f1.2, Nikon) as the tube lens. Images were acquired using Turbo-SM64 (Sci-Measure) at 2kHz with a resolution of 190 x 160 pixels, corresponding to a field of view of 1.4 x 1.2 mm. The number of frames in an image session was set at 360,000, corresponding to a duration of 180 seconds per session. Imaging depths ranged between 70 and 170 <italic>μ</italic> m from the window surface, where the CA1 pyramidal neurons were located. Time-lapse images were collected, and image stacks of the same field of view along the z-axis were acquired.

<title>LFP recording</title>
<p>The LFP signal from the contralateral CA1 region of the hippocampus was simultaneously recorded during voltage imaging. To implant the LFP electrode, a small craniotomy was performed at the dorsal CA1 coordinate (2mm caudal and 1.8 mm right to the bregma). A tungsten electrode (#100211, 38 <italic>μ</italic> m in diameter, polyimide insulated, California Fine Wire) was inserted into the dorsal CA1 region, and the wire and pins were cemented in place with dental acrylic. In order to target the CA1 pyramidal layer, the depth of the electrode was controlled and tracked by a micromanipulator (Sutter Instrument, MP-285). Pyramidal layer-specific signatures of the LFP signals, such as complex bursts and high-frequency ripple oscillations, were used to guide the targeting. The electrode location was verified by using tungsten electrodes coated with DiI (Invitrogen<sup>TM</sup>, D282), followed by brain slicing after the recordings. The electrical signal was amplified and filtered (1-1kHz) using a DAM80 amplifier (Word Precision Instruments). The amplified signal was acquired by an I/O device (National Instruments USB-6341) and recorded using WaveSurfer (Adam Taylor, HHMI Janelia Research Campus) at 10 kHz during implantation and TurboSM64 (RedShirt) at 8 kHz during imaging.</p>

<title>Voltage imaging preprocessing and spike detection</title>
<p>Fluorescence intensities were corrected for brain movement using rigid registration. Regions of interest (ROIs) were manually selected by grouping pixels that cover individual somata. Previous studies have described and validated the procedure for imaging preprocessing and spike detection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c98">98</xref></sup>. In short, the fluorescence intensities of individual neurons were calculated by averaging the fluorescence intensities of pixels from the same ROIs. Bleaching was corrected by calculating the baseline fluorescence (F<sub>0</sub>) at each time point as an average of the fluorescence intensities within ±0.5 seconds around the time point. The dF/F was calculated as the F<sub>0</sub> minus the fluorescence intensity of the same time point divided by F<sub>0</sub>. Positive fluorescence transients were detected to identify spikes from the high-passed dF/F traces created by subtracting the dF/F traces from the median-filtered version with a 5-ms window. To simulate the noise of recordings, high-passed dF/F traces were inverted, and the amplitudes of the transients detected from the inverted traces were used to construct a noise distribution of the spike amplitudes. A threshold was set by comparing the amplitudes of the detected transients with the noise distribution of the spike amplitudes to minimize the sum of type I and type II errors. Spikes were first detected when transients were larger than the threshold. Then, spike amplitudes smaller than half of the top 5% spike amplitudes were excluded. The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) was calculated for each neuron as a ratio of the averaged spike amplitudes over the standard deviation of the high-passed dF/F traces, excluding points 2 ms before and 4 ms after each detected spike to estimate the quality of the recordings. The crosstalk between ROIs was routinely checked by examining the refractory periods of neurons in auto-correlograms. Only neurons meeting the following criteria were included: (1) SNR larger than 5, (2) full width at half maximum of the spike waveform longer than 0.8 ms, (3) mean spike rates higher than 0.1 Hz, (4) distances between soma pairs at least 70 <italic>μ</italic> m. Sessions with at least nine neurons meeting the selection criteria were used for further analysis.</p>

An equal number of cells from different sessions were randomly selected to form the shuffled target cell population to assess the statistical significance of the CCG peaks. Subsequently, grand average CCGs were computed using shuffled spike trains for comparison.

<title>Detection of the population synchrony</title>
<p>To assess population synchrony, we counted the number of spikes from all neurons within a sliding window of 25 ms. To test the significance of the synchrony, we generated surrogate data by jittering spike timings within a ±75-ms window 500 times. The means and standard deviations of each sample point were calculated over the jitter population. Population synchrony was detected as peaks when the spike count in the original data exceeded the mean plus four standard deviations of the spike counts in the jittered data. Synchrony was also evaluated in modified spike trains, including those where later spikes in bursts were removed and those where spike times were shuffled across theta cycles while preserving phases. To estimate synchronous event rates, we divided the entire 180-second recordings into halves and calculated the event rate in each of the 90-s segments. Additionally, ensemble sizes were quantified by counting the percentage of neurons participating in each synchronous event.</p>

Spikes recorded during the first three minutes of the novel-maze running epochs were used to identify synchronous ensembles and generate jittered control data.

To assess the significance of cross-correlations, we generated surrogate data by jittering the spike times of the target neuron within a ±75 ms window. We computed the CCG peak for a thousand iterations and calculated p-values by comparing the percentile of the peak in the null distribution of the jittered peak values. The synchronization strength was estimated as the ratio between the original CCG peak and the mean spike count of the same bin as the original CCG peak averaged across the jittered histograms. For display purposes, the CCGs were smoothed using a 5-point moving average.

<title>LFP ripple analysis</title>
<p>To detect ripples, we performed band-pass filtering of the LFP signal between 120 and 240 Hz, followed by computing the envelope using the absolute values of the Hilbert transform, which was then low-pass filtered at 20 Hz. The start and end times of ripples were identified by setting the upper and lower thresholds at the mean plus 7 and 3.5 times the standard deviation of the envelope, respectively. For a ripple event to be included, three conditions had to be met: (1) values within the event were higher than the lower threshold, (2) at least one value exceeded the upper threshold, and (3) the minimum duration of the event was 30 ms. The start and end times of a ripple event were defined as the positive and negative crossings of the lower threshold, respectively. We defined in-ripple periods as the time between the start and end of detected LFP ripple events, while out-ripple periods were periods outside the in-ripple periods. The envelope peak values of the detected ripple events were used as the time of ripple occurrence. These timings were utilized as trigger timings to calculate averages triggered by ripples. Two co-occurrences were quantified: the percentages of LFP ripple oscillations that occurred with synchronous ensembles and the percentages of synchronous ensembles that occurred with LFP ripple oscillations. The same ripple detection algorithm was applied to the hc-11 dataset. To account for artifacts in the recordings, raw traces and power spectra of the detected events were plotted and inspected for false positives.</p>

Specifically, we first calculated the mean firing rate during in-ripple periods and the mean firing rate during out-ripple periods. Next, we subtracted the mean firing rate during out-ripple periods from the mean firing rate during in-ripple periods and divided the result by the sum of the mean firing rates during both periods. The resulting ripple modulation index indicates the magnitude and direction of the firing rate modulation during ripple compared to periods outside ripples. To assess the significance of the modulation index, we shuffled the spike timings and repeated the calculation a thousand times to generate a distribution of modulation indices from the shuffled data.

<title>Cross-correlation and coherence analysis to the subVm traces</title>
<p>To calculate cross-correlation and theta coherence of subVm between pairs of neurons during locomotion and immobility, we initially divided the 180-second subVm traces into 1-second segments with a 50% overlap. These segments were then categorized into the locomotion group if the animal’s speed remained above three cm/s for more than 90% of the time within that segment. Similarly, segments were sorted into the immobility group if the animal’s speed remained below one cm/s for more than 90% of the time within that segment. Subsequently, we computed the cross-correlation and magnitude-squared coherence function of frequency for pairs of co-occurred segments belonging to a specific cell pair. Mean cross-correlations of individual cell pairs were averaged across segments that occurred in the same behavioral states (i.e., locomotion or immobility states). To estimate theta coherence, we averaged the values of the coherence function within the theta frequency range (4-12 Hz). Theta coherences from the same cell pair during the same behavioral state were pooled together, and the average was used as an estimate for the theta coherence of that cell pair during a particular behavioral state. Finally, Spearman correlation coefficients were calculated between the mean theta coherences of cell pairs and their soma distances.</p>

<title>Spatial analysis</title>
<p>We partitioned a 90-cm-long track into 36 spatial bins to analyze spatial tuning properties. For each cell, the spatial tuning curve was computed by determining the mean firing rate, defined as the number of spikes within the bin when the animal’s speed exceeded three cm/s, divided by the total dwell times using the same speed threshold. The peak firing rates were identified as the maximal rate on the spatial tuning curve. Spatial selectivity was calculated as one minus the circular variance of the spatial tuning curve. Neurons were classified as place cells when their spatial selectivity exceeded 0.25, and peak firing rates exceeded 1 Hz. To assess the similarity of spatial tuning between pairs of neurons, Spearman correlation coefficients were calculated for the spatial tuning curves. To explore the relationship between levels of synchronization and spatial tuning similarity among pairs of place cells, Spearman correlation coefficients were computed between synchronization strengths of cell pairs and correlation coefficients of their spatial tuning curves.</p>

<title>Data analysis and statistics</title>
<p>Data analysis was performed using MATLAB (Mathworks, R2019b), and results were presented as standard error of the mean unless otherwise specified. Boxplots were used to depict the median, first quartile, and third quartile, with the middle line, the upper edge, and the lower edge of the box, respectively. The whiskers of the boxplots represented the 5th and 95<sup>th</sup> percentiles of the distribution.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>For many years, there has been extensive electrophysiological research investigating the relationship between local field potential patterns and individual cell spike patterns in the hippocampus. In this study, using innovative imaging techniques, they examined spike synchrony of hippocampal cells during locomotion and immobility states. The authors demonstrated that hippocampal place cells exhibit prominent synchronous spikes locked to theta oscillations.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The single cell voltage imaging used in this study is a highly novel method that may allow recordings that were not previously possible using existing methods.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The strength of evidence remains incomplete because of the main claim that synchronous events are not associated with ripples. As was mentioned in previous rounds of review, ripples emerge locally and independently in the two hemispheres. Thus, obtaining ripple recordings from the contralateral hemisphere does not provide solid evidence for this claim. The papers the authors are citing to make the claim that &quot;Additionally, we implanted electrodes in the contralateral CA1 region to monitor theta and ripple oscillations, which are known to co-occur across hemispheres (29-31)&quot; do not support this claim. For example, reference 29 contains the following statement: &quot;These findings suggest that ripples emerge locally and independently in the two hemispheres&quot;.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the current reviews.</p>
<p>We thank the editor and reviewers for their thoughtful evaluations. We would like to clarify that the revised manuscript does not make a general claim about the absence of ripple-associated synchronous population activity. Rather, we report only that the synchronous ensembles observed in our data were not associated with contralateral ripple oscillations. This distinction is clearly reflected in the revised Title, Abstract, Introduction, Results, and Discussion. We also explicitly acknowledged the methodological limitation of recording LFP from the contralateral side of the hippocampus.</p>
<p>To further improve clarity and prevent potential misinterpretation, we are submitting a revised version (R4) in which we:</p>
<p>(1) Replace the word &quot;surprisingly&quot; with the more neutral &quot;Moreover&quot;;</p>
<p>(2) Refer to ripple events consistently as &quot;contralateral ripples (c-ripples)&quot;;</p>
<p>(3)Expand the discussion of limitations inherent to contralateral LFP recordings.</p>
<p>Additionally, while Buzsaki et al. (2003) wrote that &quot;These findings suggest ripples emerge locally and independently in the two hemispheres&quot;, the same study also presents data and reports that &quot;Ripple episodes occurred simultaneously in the left and right CA1 regions&quot; (p. 206). Our original citation was intended to reflect this nuance. Nevertheless, to avoid any potential misinterpretation, we have removed the co-occurrence statement with its associated citations in the revised (R4) manuscript.</p>
<p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>For many years, there has been extensive electrophysiological research investigating the relationship between local field potential patterns and individual cell spike patterns in the hippocampus. In this study, using state-ofthe-art imaging techniques, they examined spike synchrony of hippocampal cells during locomotion and immobility states. In contrast to conventional understanding of the hippocampus, the authors demonstrated that hippocampal place cells exhibit prominent synchronous spikes locked to theta oscillations.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The voltage imaging used in this study is a highly novel method that allows recording not only suprathreshold-level spikes but also subthreshold-level activity. With its high frame rate, it offers time resolution comparable to electrophysiological recordings.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This study employed voltage imaging in the CA1 region of the mouse hippocampus during the exploration of a novel environment. The authors report synchronous activity, involving almost half of the imaged neurons, occurred during periods of immobility. These events did not correlate with SWRs, but instead, occurred during theta oscillations and were phased locked to the trough of theta. Moreover, pairs of neurons with high synchronization tended to display non-overlapping place fields, leading the authors to suggest these events may play a role in binding a distributed representation of the context.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Technically this is an impressive study, using an emerging approach that allows single cell resolution voltage imaging in animals, that while head-fixed, can move through a real environment. The paper is written clearly and suggests novel observations about population level activity in CA1.</p>
<p>Comments on revisions:</p>
<p>I have no further major requests and thank the authors for the additional data and analyses.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In the present manuscript, the authors use a few minutes of voltage imaging of CA1 pyramidal cells in head fixed mice running on a track while local field potential (LFPs) are recorded. The authors suggest that synchronous ensembles of neurons are differentially associated with different types of LFP patterns, theta and ripples. The experiments are flawed in that the LFP is not &quot;local&quot; but rather collected the other side of the brain.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors use a cutting-edge technique.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Although the authors have toned down their claims, the statement in the title (&quot;Synchronous Ensembles of Hippocampal CA1 Pyramidal Neurons Associated with Theta but not Ripple Oscillations During Novel Exploration&quot;) is still unsupported.</p>
<p>One could write the same title while voltage imaging one mouse and recording LFP from another mouse.</p>
<p>To properly convey the results, the title should be modified to read</p>
<p>&quot;Synchronous Ensembles of Hippocampal CA1 Pyramidal Neurons Associated with Contralateral Theta but not with Contralateral Ripple Oscillations During Novel Exploration&quot;</p>
<p>Without making this change, the title - and therefore the entire work - is misleading at best.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for the thoughtful and constructive suggestion regarding the title. We fully understand the concern that our original title may have overstated the specificity of the contralateral LFP recordings, potentially allowing for misinterpretation.</p>
<p>In our results, synchronous ensembles are associated with intracellular theta oscillations recorded from the ipsilateral hippocampus and with extracellular theta but not ripples oscillations recorded from the contralateral hippocampus. To clarify this distinction and minimize the potential for misinterpretation, we have revised the abstract accordingly.</p>
<p>Abstract (line18):</p>
<p>“… Notably, these synchronous ensembles were not associated with contralateral ripple oscillations but were instead phase-locked to theta waves recorded in the contralateral CA1 region. Moreover, the subthreshold membrane potentials of neurons exhibited coherent intracellular theta oscillations with a depolarizing peak at the moment of synchrony.”</p>
<p>Based on this, we propose the following revised title, which we believe more effectively communicates the central finding of our study:</p>
<p>“Synchronous Ensembles of Hippocampal CA1 Pyramidal Neurons During Novel Exploration”.</p>
<p>Compared to the reviewer’s suggested title, this version offers a clearer and more concise summary of our findings while allowing important methodological details to be fully conveyed in the abstract and main text. While the suggested title accurately reflects the source of the LFP signals, it does not mention the intracellular theta oscillations recorded from the ipsilateral hippocampus, which are a critical part of our results. Including both the intracellular and extracellular recording contexts in the title would make it overly long and potentially less accessible to readers. In contrast, the revised title succinctly captures the core phenomenon, and the updated abstract now explicitly clarifies the relationship between the synchronous ensembles and both types of oscillatory signals.</p>
<p>We sincerely appreciate the reviewer’s input, which helped us refine both the language and the presentation of our findings. We hope these changes address the concern and clarify the scope of our work.</p>

<p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p>
<p>(1) Change the title. Although the authors have toned down their claims, the statement in the title (&quot;Synchronous Ensembles of Hippocampal CA1 Pyramidal Neurons Associated with Theta but not Ripple Oscillations During Novel Exploration&quot;) is still unsupported. One could write the same title while voltage imaging one mouse and recording LFP from another mouse. To properly convey the results, the title should be modified to read</p>
<p>&quot;Synchronous Ensembles of Hippocampal CA1 Pyramidal Neurons Associated with Contralateral Theta but not with Contralateral Ripple Oscillations During Novel Exploration&quot;</p>
<p>Without making this change, the title - and therefore the entire work - is misleading at best. But if you can manage that (and attend to comment #2 below), then the manuscript would not be making any false statements.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Please see our reply in the public review above.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) Report the exact locations of the contralateral recording electrodes. In their rebuttal, the authors supplies a figure (&quot;Author response image 1&quot;) in which they show damage to the neocortex and fluorescence signal in the CA1 pyramidal cell layer. This is useful, but it is unclear from which animal this histology was generated.</p>
<p>Please include this (or another similar) photograph in Figure 1B, right next to the voltage imaging photograph. Indicate from which animal each photograph was obtained - ideally, provide the two photographs from the same animal. Second, please include such paired photographs - along with paired signals - for every animal that you are able to.</p>
<p>If you can manage that, it will add credibility to the statement that the recordings are indeed from the contralateral CA1 pyramidal cell layer (as opposed to from the contralateral hemisphere).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for this important point. We have followed the suggestion and now provide paired photographs showing LFP electrode tracks and voltage images from the same animal (see revised Figure 1B)</p>
<p>In addition, we have included similar paired photographs for additional animals used in this study (see Figure 1-figure supplement 1).</p>
<p>These updates directly support the claim that LFP recordings were obtained from the contralateral CA1 pyramidal layer, rather than from the contralateral hemisphere. We sincerely thank the reviewer for the valuable suggestion, which has substantially strengthened our manuscript.</p>
