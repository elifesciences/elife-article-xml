<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Saliva is essential for oral health. The molecular mechanisms leading to physiological fluid secretion are established, but factors that underlie secretory hypofunction, specifically related to the autoimmune disease Sjögren’s syndrome (SS) are not fully understood. SS-like disease was induced by the treatment with 5,6-Dimethyl-9-oxo-9H-xanthene-4-acetic acid (DMXAA), an activator of the stimulator of the interferon gene (STING) pathway. This mouse model mimics exposure to foreign cytoplasmic ribonucleotides occurring following viral and bacterial infection and thought to be an initiating event in SS. Neurotransmitter-stimulated increases in cytoplasmic [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] are central to stimulating fluid secretion, primarily by increasing the activity of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated Cl<sup>-</sup> channel, TMEM16a. Paradoxically, in DMXAA-treated mice <italic>in vivo</italic> imaging demonstrated that neural-stimulation resulted in greatly enhanced Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels when a significant reduction in fluid secretion was observed. Notably, in the disease model, the spatiotemporal characteristics of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals were altered to result in global rather than largely apically confined Ca<sup>2+</sup> rises observed physiologically. Notwithstanding the augmented Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals, muscarinic stimulation resulted in reduced activation of TMEM16a, although there were no changes in channel abundance or absolute sensitivity to Ca<sup>2+</sup>. However, super-resolution microscopy revealed a disruption in the localization of Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor Ca<sup>2+</sup> release channels in relation to TMEM16a. Appropriate Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling is also pivotal for mitochondrial morphology and bioenergetics and secretion is an energetically expensive process. Disrupted mitochondrial morphology, a depolarized mitochondrial membrane potential, and reduced oxygen consumption rate were observed in DMXAA-treated animals compared to control animals. We report that early in SS disease, dysregulated Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals lead to decreased fluid secretion and disrupted mitochondrial function contributing to salivary gland hypofunction and likely the progression of SS disease.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Saliva plays crucial roles in oral health, including lubricating the mouth, maintaining pH balance, defense against microorganisms, aiding taste, and initiating digestion of macronutrients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Carpenter, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Pedersen et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Williamson, 2001</xref>). Saliva is produced primarily by three major salivary glands; the submandibular gland (SMG), parotid gland (PG), sublingual gland (SLG), and some minor glands in the lower lip, tongue, and cheeks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Kessler &amp; Bhatt, 2018</xref>). Saliva is generated in secretory acinar cells, with its content adjusted by ducts before reaching the mouth. The acinar cells are fundamental to the production of the primary salivary secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">de Paula et al., 2017</xref>). The fluid secretion process is driven by the trans-epithelial movement of Cl<sup>-</sup> across acinar cells. To accomplish vectorial movement of Cl<sup>-</sup>, acinar cells are polarized such that the basolateral plasma membrane (PM) faces the interstitium and is adjacent to blood vessels, while the apical PM forms a lumen with the distinct PM regions physically segregated by tight-junctional complexes. At the basolateral PM, Cl<sup>-</sup> are transported into the acinar cell cytoplasm against their electrochemical gradient <italic>via</italic> the Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>/2Cl<sup>-</sup> cotransporter, (NKCC1). Following mastication or the experience of the taste and the smell of food, the neurotransmitter, acetylcholine (ACh) is released from parasympathetic nerves and acts on muscarinic receptors on the basolateral PM. Activated muscarinic receptors promote the production of inositol 1,4,5 trisphosphate (IP<sub>3</sub>), and subsequently Ca<sup>2+</sup> release from endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stores <italic>via</italic> IP<sub>3</sub> receptors (IP<sub>3</sub>Rs) situated in the ER in the extreme luminal aspects of the cell. Elevated [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> activates a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated Cl<sup>-</sup> channel named TMEM16a that allows Cl<sup>-</sup> to move through the apical PM to the ductal lumen which is continuous with the salivary intercalated duct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Melvin et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Pedersen et al., 2018</xref>). In turn, Na<sup>+</sup> moves through the paracellular space to balance the Cl<sup>-</sup> and water follows osmotically both paracellularly and through the water channel aquaporin5 (AQP5) to generate the primary saliva (Soren Nielsen &amp; Birgitte Monster Christensen, 1997; V. Gresz, 2001).</p>
<p>The importance of saliva is underappreciated in the absence of hypofunction. Reduced salivary secretion is termed xerostomia and can result from the iatrogenic effects of drugs, as collateral damage to salivary glands following radiotherapy for malignancy in the head and neck area, and commonly in Sjögren’s syndrome (SS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Saleh et al., 2015</xref>). SS is a chronic autoimmune disorder, that is predominantly manifested as profound dry eye and dry mouth as ultimately the immune system targets and destroys lacrimal and salivary gland cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Brito-Zeron et al., 2016</xref>; Clio P. Mavragani MD, 2014; Khalid F. Tabbara, 2000; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Ramos-Casals et al., 2012</xref>). SS can occur independently (primary SS, pSS) or concurrently with diseases such as arthritis or lupus (secondary SS, sSS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Felten, Meyer, &amp; Gottenberg, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Negrini et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Sebastian, Szachowicz, &amp; Wiland, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Weerasinghe &amp; Jayasinghe, 2022</xref>). SS affects millions of people, predominantly women in their fourth and fifth decades of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Paul Kruszka, 2009</xref>). While treatments can alleviate symptoms, there is no cure or intervention to halt its progression. The etiology of SS remains largely unresolved, but it’s believed to result from a combination of genetic, environmental, hormonal, and possibly viral factors, causing an aberrant immune response directed against the exocrine glands. The identification of SS usually is scored by the extent of salivary hypofunction, the degree of immune infiltration, evidence of damage to minor salivary glands observed following biopsy, and the presence of autoantibodies, such as anti-SSA (Ro) and Anti-SSB (La) and anti-nuclear antibody (ANA) which are classically found in SS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Jonsson et al., 2018</xref>). Notably, however, in the early phases of SS, there is minor immune infiltration and little overt damage to exocrine tissue despite profound hypofunction. Provocatively, these data indicate that loss of secretory tissue <italic>per se</italic> is not the causative event resulting in dryness early in the disease, and further indicates that a defect in the stimulus-secretion coupling mechanism precedes glandular destruction and possibly contributes to the progression of disease.</p>
<p>Over the years, numerous mouse models both genetic and “induced” have been developed to study the pathogenesis of SS, with each exhibiting specific aspects of the human condition, including glandular dysfunction, autoantibody production, and lymphocytic infiltration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Gao et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Lee et al., 2012</xref>). To investigate the early events in SS, in this study, we concentrated on an SS model induced by activation of the stimulator of the interferon gene (STING) pathway. This is thought to mirror the molecular response to bacterial/viral infection. STING is primarily located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and plays a crucial role in the innate immune response, especially against DNA viruses and intracellular bacteria. Activation of STING occurs upon sensing cytosolic DNA as a result of cell damage or from microbial origin following infection. When cytosolic DNA is detected, it is first recognized by a sensor molecule called cGAS (cyclic GMP-AMP synthase). Binding to DNA prompts cGAS to generate cGAMP (cyclic GMP-AMP), which, in turn, binds to and activates STING (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Decout et al., 2021</xref>). Once STING is activated, it undergoes a series of transformations that ultimately result in the transcription of type I interferon genes, especially interferon-β (IFN-β) (J. Papinska, 2018). The production of type I interferons, especially IFN-β, is a primary antiviral response, and a significant characteristic of SS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Huijser et al., 2022</xref>; J. Papinska, 2018). STING can be activated pharmacologically by exposure to 5,6-Dimethyl-9-oxo-9<italic>H</italic>-xanthene-4-acetic acid (DMXAA), which faithfully reproduces the immune response observed following STING activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Ceron et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Gao et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Weiss et al., 2017</xref>).</p>
<p>In this study, we investigated the early events in the initiation of SS-like disease that lead to salivary gland hypo-function using the DMXAA SS model. We first utilized <italic>in vivo</italic> intravital imaging to investigate any potential dysregulation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling in the DMXAA-induced SS mouse model. Paradoxically, the Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels achieved following neural stimulation in mice treated with DMXAA were enhanced despite significantly reduced fluid secretion. Notably, however, the stereotypical spatial characteristics of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal were disrupted. Downstream of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal, the activity of the TMEM16a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated Cl channel stimulated by muscarinic secretagogues was reduced, despite no changes in the abundance or localization of the protein or absolute sensitivity to activation by Ca<sup>2+</sup>. The intimate localization of IP<sub>3</sub>R and TMEM16a was however disrupted, which may contribute to the reduced activity of TMEM16a upon agonist stimulation. Moreover, we observed disrupted mitochondrial morphology, abundance, and function in the disease model. These data suggest that early in SS, reduced fluid secretion occurs because of a defect in the secretagogue activation of Cl<sup>-</sup> secretion. Further significant mitochondrial dysfunction is evident, likely as a result of the aberrant Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals which may contribute to the progression of SS disease.</p>

<title>Saliva secretion is attenuated in both SMG and PG in the SS mouse model</title>
<p>Activation of the STING pathway in mice has been established as a model for the initiation of SS. This pathway is normally activated following exposure to foreign nucleic acids and is thought to mimic exposure of cells to DNA/RNA from viruses and bacteria. Activation of this pathway in salivary glands is characterized by initiation of a type-1 interferon response, mild immune cell infiltration, and a marked loss of saliva secretion without obvious morphological damage and therefore mimics the early clinical manifestations of SS disease. Thus, to investigate the early cellular events in acinar cells during the initiation of SS in mice, we chose to pharmacologically activate this pathway using DMXAA, a STING pathway agonist. As described in Methods, DMXAA (or control solution) was administered on day 0 and day 21 of the experimental timeline (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). Immunofluorescent staining in sliced SMG tissue indicated that STING protein was highly expressed in SMG in the DMXAA-treated mouse on day 28, seven days after the final DMXAA administration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Supplement 1</xref>) confirming the activation of the STING pathway. Whole saliva production as a function of stimulation of the major salivary glands was evaluated on day 28 following stimulation by the muscarinic receptor agonist, pilocarpine. To avoid potential weight-related variations in saliva secretion, the total saliva output was normalized to the individual mouse’s body weight. Notably, the average saliva production was reduced from 130.1± 48.96 mg in vehicle-treated mice to 63.71± 30.41 mg in DMXAA-treated mice, a reduction in saliva production of 48.97% (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). Consequently, DMXAA treatment resulted in 51.99% saliva production compared to vehicle-treated mice (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). Moreover, the H&amp;E staining indicated that mild immune infiltration was observed in the DMXAA-treated mice (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>). Collectively, these results suggest that DMXAA-treated mice exhibit characteristics of early-stage SS and could be a useful model for investigating the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying secretory dysfunction and advancing our understanding of the disease’s progression.</p>

</fig>
<p>To further investigate the individual relative contribution of the SMG and PG to the decrease in total saliva secretion using a more physiological stimulation paradigm, we performed experiments where the nerve bundle innervating a particular gland was electrically stimulated and saliva secretion quantitated. Previous research in our lab has established the range and parameters for physiological stimulation of secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Takano et al., 2021</xref>). The production of saliva was significantly diminished at stimulation frequencies of 7 and 10 Hz in SMG (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>) and at 5, 7, and 10 Hz in the PG (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>) in DMXAA-treated animals compared with vehicle controls. These findings confirm that activation of the STING pathway reduces the function of both SMG and PG, consistent with the reduction in the production of whole saliva. Notably, the reduction in function of PG, the gland responsible for the majority of stimulated saliva secretion, was relatively greater than in SMG.</p>

<title>Altered spatiotemporal characteristics of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals in the SS mouse model</title>
<p>An increase in intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> plays a central role in regulating the intricate cellular machinery underlying secretion processes. In particular, as noted, an increase in Ca<sup>2+</sup> is important for the activation of ion channels localized in particular domains of the polarized acinar cell which play a central role in the fluid secretion mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Takano et al., 2021</xref>). Given that the precise spatiotemporal characteristics of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal in salivary acinar cells are thought to be fundamental to the appropriate activation of the fluid secretion machinery, we evaluated whether the disruption of fluid secretion following DMXAA treatment resulted from dysregulation of the stimulated Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal. Previous research in our lab developed a platform to study Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling <italic>in vivo</italic> using Multiphoton (MP) imaging in transgenic mice engineered to express a genetic-encoded Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator, GCaMP6f, specifically in acinar cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Takano et al., 2021</xref>). The protocol for STING pathway induction was applied to the Mist1<sup>CreERT+/-</sup> GCamp6F<sup>+/-</sup> genetic mouse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Supplement 2A</xref>). The salivary gland function was assessed by the amount of pilocarpine-induced saliva. The secretion deficiency observed in wild-type mice was recapitulated in these mice with a different genetic background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Supplement 2B</xref>). We reasoned that decreased fluid secretion in DMXAA-treated mice could result from reduced or dysregulated Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling. Therefore, next, we compared the Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal evoked by direct nerve stimulation in DMXAA-treated versus vehicle control animals <italic>in vivo</italic> in SMG. SMG were stimulated at frequencies optimum for fluid secretion (1-10 Hz) for 10 seconds and the Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals were recorded. <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref> is the standard deviation (SD)-projecting images displayed the Ca<sup>2+</sup> distribution and amplitude change in the Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling following stimulation. In vehicle-treated mice, the Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals were initiated in a limited number of acinar cells. These signals predominantly propagated below the apical PM. As the stimulation frequency increased, Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals became more pronounced, and more acinar cells responded. Strikingly, the acinar cells in DMXAA-treated mice demonstrated enhanced sensitivity to stimulation. Even at lower frequency stimulations, a larger number of acinar cells responded, and the Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals in these cells were notably larger when compared to those in the control group. <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref> shows a time series of images following 7 Hz stimulation. Surprisingly, nerve stimulation resulted in a significantly enhanced maximal response when compared to vehicle-treated animals at physiological stimulus frequencies (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>/B). This augmented response was manifested as an elevated maximum peak [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>), shorter latency (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>), and larger area under the curve (AUC) during stimulation in DMXAA-treated animals (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>In addition to the absolute magnitude of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal, the subcellular spatial characteristics of the stimulated Ca<sup>2+</sup> rise are also important for appropriate stimulation of fluid secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Takano et al., 2021</xref>). Physiological Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals stimulated following nervous stimulation in SMG are invariably initiated in the extreme apical pole of acinar cells and subsequently establish a standing gradient that dissipates rapidly to result in apically confined signals that do not substantially propagate to the basal aspects of the cell following physiological stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Takano et al., 2021</xref>). We therefore investigated if the spatial characteristics of stimulated Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals were altered in DMXAA-treated animals. SD image projections generated during the period of stimulation demonstrated that the [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> increase was tightly localized below the apical PM within the acinar cells in the vehicle-treated animals (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). However, in the DMXAA-treated animals, the [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> exhibited a more global distribution through the cytoplasm (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). The [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> was visualized <italic>via</italic> line-scan plots revealing the temporal alterations along a line extending from the apical PM to the basolateral PM, traversing the nucleus over time within an acinar cell. A significant [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> elevation was evident at the basolateral aspects of the acinar cell in the DMXAA-treated animals (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>) when compared to the vehicle-treated control (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>). The comparison of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal ratios at the apical versus basolateral PM indicated the most significant global Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal at 10 Hz stimulation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>) which corresponds to the stimulation strength that results in maximal fluid secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Takano et al., 2021</xref>). In summary, these data demonstrate that the absolute magnitude of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal following stimulation is augmented in DMXAA-treated animals and thus cannot in itself account for the reduced fluid secretion. Nevertheless, the spatiotemporal characteristics of the signals are disrupted and could contribute to inappropriate activation of the machinery necessary for ion and fluid secretion.</p>

<title>Secretagogue stimulated TMEM16a activity is suppressed in the SS mouse model</title>
<p>The rate-limiting step for the secretion of fluid is the activation of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated Cl<sup>-</sup> channel, TMEM16a. We considered that a reduction in fluid secretion could conceptually occur by a reduction or mislocalization of TMEM16a protein, or by compromised muscarinic receptor-stimulated activation of the channel. Western blotting indicated the TMEM16a protein expression was comparable between the vehicle and SS mouse models (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4B</xref>). In addition, immunolocalization using confocal microscopy demonstrated that TMEM16a localization remained largely unchanged in the SS mouse model (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>). Thus, a decrease in protein expression or mislocalization of the protein does not result in a reduction in stimulated saliva secretion. We next investigated whether the activation of this ion channel was compromised in DMXAA-treated animals using whole-cell patch clamp electrophysiology. In the absence of stimulation, no Cl<sup>-</sup> currents were observed in either vehicle or DMXAA animals following either depolarizing or hyperpolarizing voltage steps from a holding potential of -50 mV (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>). In the presence of 1 μM of muscarinic agonist Carbachol (CCh), robust Cl<sup>-</sup> currents were measured in acini prepared from vehicle-treated animals (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>), which were greatly reduced in DMXAA-treated animals (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4F</xref>). Reduced CCh-stimulated Cl<sup>-</sup> currents could potentially occur because of altered Ca<sup>2+</sup> regulation of TMEM16a following disruption of the spatial characteristics of the stimulated Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal. Theoretically, it is also possible that the [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> in the immediate vicinity of TMEM16a was disrupted, despite the augmented global peak response. We therefore next tested whether TMEM16a activity stimulated directly by either 1 or 5 μM Ca<sup>2+</sup> in the pipette solution (and thus globally in the cytoplasm) was altered in DMXAA- treated animals. Surprisingly, TMEM16a was activated to a similar extent by Ca<sup>2+</sup> in the SS mouse model (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5C</xref>). In total, our data suggest that TMEM16a abundance, localization, or activity <italic>per se</italic> are not altered; however, there was a significant reduction in saliva in the DMXAA-treated model. An alternative mechanism would be that the microdomain between the apical ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> release sites and the apical PM TMEM16a is disrupted in the disease model, resulting in compromised ion channel activation. Therefore, we employed STED super-resolution microscopy to closely examine the spatial relationship between apical PM TMEM16a and IP<sub>3</sub>R3 on the apical ER (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>). Despite the cell-cell contact distance remaining consistent in the disease model, as indicated by the distance between TMEM16a on the PM of adjacent acinar cells (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6F</xref>), a notable increase in distance between the apical TMEM16a and IP<sub>3</sub>R3 expressed on apical ER compared to the control group was observed. In the control mice, the distance between TMEM16a and IP<sub>3</sub>R3 was on average 84 ± 17 nm, versus 155 ± 20 nm in the SS disease mice. Similarly, the distance between IP<sub>3</sub>R3 in adjacent cells was increased from 505 ± 34 nm to 689 ± 68 nm (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6D</xref>). This observation supports the conclusion that the reduced activity of the TMEM16a channel, may be attributable to the disruption of the microdomain between TMEM16a and IP<sub>3</sub>R3, such that the Ca<sup>2+</sup> flux through the IP<sub>3</sub>R is not communicated appropriately to its effector, TMEM16a.</p>

<title>Compromised mitochondrial morphology and metabolism in the SS mouse model</title>
<p>Ca<sup>2+</sup> modulates cellular metabolism by the intricate bidirectional interaction between the ER and mitochondria. Ca<sup>2+</sup> transfer between ER and mitochondria is essential for optimal bioenergetics, and dysregulated [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> can be deleterious to mitochondrial function and alter morphology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Csordas et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Duchen, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Katona et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Ye et al., 2021</xref>). The transfer of Ca<sup>2+</sup> between ER and mitochondria is dependent on the intimate physical localization of the organelles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Katona et al., 2022</xref>). Notably, aberrant mitochondrial morphology has been reported in the salivary glands of SS patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Barrera et al., 2021</xref>). We first investigated mitochondrial abundance and morphology by immunofluorescence staining with antibodies directed against ATP5A, a component of the ATP synthesis machinery to visualize mitochondria, and Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> ATPase to localize the plasma membrane (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A</xref>). Using previously published methodologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Harwig et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Valente et al., 2017</xref>), quantification revealed a 22.16% ± 4.95 reduction in mitochondrial numbers in the SS mouse model relative to the vehicle-treated control (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7B</xref>). Consistent with reduced mitochondrial numbers, less area was occupied by mitochondria in DMXAA-treated acinar cells (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7C</xref>). Mitochondria morphology is intricately linked to their bioenergetic status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Duvezin-Caubet et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Galloway, Lee, &amp; Yoon, 2012</xref>). We next evaluated mitochondrial morphology by their “so-called” aspect ratio (AR) and form factor (FF) in DMXAA and vehicle-treated animals. The AR, the length of the major over minor axes of mitochondria documents the degree of fragmentation or elongation of individual mitochondria. Mitochondria exhibited an 18.35% ± 4.62 decrease in mitochondrial elongation (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7D</xref>) and a 20.7% ± 7.78 decrease in mitochondrial branching (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7E</xref>) in the disease model compared to the vehicle-treated control condition. Importantly, these changes in mitochondrial number and morphology were not exclusive to the SMG as similar patterns were observed in the PG mitochondria, again marked by reduced mitochondrial count, increased fragmentation, and decreased branching (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">Supplement 3A-3E</xref>).</p>

<p>Next, we utilized electron microscopy (EM) to investigate mitochondrial ultrastructure. At low magnification, acinar cells from control mice contained defined mitochondria and well-formed ER stacks (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8A</xref>. blue arrow). In contrast, the ER structure was disrupted in the SS disease model (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8A</xref>’). At higher magnification, the coordinated ER structure was largely absent in diseased mice (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8B</xref> and <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">8B</xref>’), and the close proximity between ER and mitochondria was disrupted (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8H</xref> and <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">8I</xref>). Moreover, we also observed scattered mitochondrial cristae at the highest magnification (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8C</xref>’ and 8G).

<p>Mitochondrial morphology is a dynamic process that is intimately associated with mitochondrial bioenergetics and alterations in both occur in response to changes in cellular status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Benard et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Galloway, Lee, &amp; Yoon, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Ishihara et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Navaratnarajah et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Parone et al., 2008</xref>). Next, we investigated if changes in morphology might be associated with the disrupted function of mitochondria in the disease model. We, therefore, measured mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨ<sub>m</sub>), the driving force of ATP production, in isolated SMG acinar cells. Isolated SMG acinar cells were loaded with TMRE, a ΔΨ<sub>m</sub>-specific dye, and MitoTracker Green, to confirm mitochondrial localization and to facilitate the normalization of indicator loading. The maximal z-stacks projection images taken by confocal microscopy revealed colocalization of TMRE with MitoTracker Green (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9A</xref>). To measure the ΔΨ<sub>m</sub>, we quantified the relative maximum dissipation of ΔΨ<sub>m</sub> in DMXAA and vehicle-treated acinar cells by the mitochondrial uncoupler, FCCP (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9B</xref>).

<p>An appropriate ΔΨ<sub>m</sub> mitochondrial membrane potential is vital for maintaining bioenergetics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Zorova et al., 2018</xref>). Given that mitochondrial ΔΨ<sub>m</sub> was significantly depolarized in DMXAA-treated animals, we next evaluated the OCR, a key metric of mitochondrial bioenergetic function in isolated SMG acinar cells. We employed sequential exposure to agents that target the function of the mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC) using Seahorse technology (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9D</xref>). Our results revealed a 25% reduction in basal OCR in the SS model compared to the control animals (at -25.25 ± 7.89 pmol/min; <xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9E</xref>). While ATP-linked respiration showed no significant difference in post-oligomycin-induced ETC Complex V blockade in both conditions (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9F</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>SS is a complex inflammatory disease resulting from the intersection of genetics and environmental factors. This autoimmune disorder affects exocrine glands including salivary and lacrimal glands, leading to dry mouth and dry eyes, among other symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Brito-Zeron et al., 2016</xref>; Clio P. Mavragani MD, 2014; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Ramos-Casals et al., 2012</xref>). SS animal models are crucial for understanding the pathogenesis, progression, and potential treatments for the disease, though like many animal models of disease, none can recapitulate all the aspects of SS. Currently, SS animal models are categorized as either those derived from genetically modified mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Kiripolsky et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Shen et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Shen et al., 2006</xref>; Yanfei Hu, 1992) or those where disease is induced by specific agents or environmental factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Gao et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Lee et al., 2012</xref>). In the context of SS, DMXAA-induced SS can be used to mimic the early stages of the disease which might be triggered in response to bacterial or viral infection. This model is particularly effective in simulating type-1 interferon immune responses seen in early SS, which is thought to contribute to the initial glandular inflammation (J. Papinska, 2018; Khalid F. Tabbara, 2000; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Papinska et al., 2020</xref>). The rapid symptom manifestation of disease in the DMXAA-induced model offers an advantage for investigating the early development of SS disease since DMXAA induction is a temporally controlled process, allowing the precise staging of disease onset, thus facilitating studies on the initiating events and ultimately potential early intervention and prevention strategies.</p>
<p>Our studies investigated stimulus-secretion coupling when fluid secretion from SMG and PG in response to physiological stimulation was confirmed to be significantly reduced. Previous work has established a crucial link between an increase in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> and stimulation of fluid secretion in the salivary glands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Ambudkar, 2011</xref>; Ha-Van Nguyen, 2003; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Kiselyov et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Lee et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Li, Luo, &amp; Muallem, 2004</xref>). Efficient secretion is reliant on the specific spatiotemporal regulation of secretagogue-stimulated [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> signals. Given this idea, our initial hypothesis was that a deficiency in secretion after DMXAA administration could be due to reduced or disrupted secretagogue-stimulated [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> signals. Indeed, previous work has revealed that in human SS patient acinar cells and the IL14α knock-in transgenic SS mouse model, that CCh-induced [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] signals were diminished. This reduction was attributed to lower expression levels of the IP<sub>3</sub>R2 and IP<sub>3</sub>R3 proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Teos et al., 2015</xref>). To probe this hypothesis, we employed transgenic Mist1<sup>CreERT2+/–</sup> x GCaMP6f<sup>+/–</sup> that expresses Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator-GCamp6F specifically in the acinar cells. Firstly, we validated that the activation of the STING pathway leads to similar salivary gland hypofunction in this genetic background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Supplement 2</xref>). Surprisingly, however, DMXAA treatment led to a striking increase in the magnitude of neurally-induced [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> signals. This observation is not consistent with the loss of IP<sub>3</sub>R proteins being responsible for reduced fluid secretion previously reported in other SS models. Indeed, the expression of IP<sub>3</sub>R proteins was unchanged following DMXAA treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs5">Supplement 5</xref>). The discrepancy could be attributed to the stage of SS disease represented by the early studies, with our data presenting an earlier initiating phase of SS disease prior to progression, at a time point before any notable decrease in IP<sub>3</sub>R proteins has occured. The molecular mechanism responsible for augmented Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals following DMXAA treatment requires further study, nevertheless, we suggest that this might represent a compensatory mechanism in an effort to drive fluid secretion in the face of compromised physiological stimulus-secretion coupling. Although the Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals were not reduced, the spatiotemporal characteristics of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal were markedly disrupted. Specifically, during neural stimulation, while in control animals there is a pronounced standing gradient of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] such that the [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] is much greater in the apical <italic>vs.</italic> basal aspects of the cell, in DMXAA-treated animals this gradient is largely absent as large changes in Ca<sup>2+</sup> are propagated to the basal regions of the cells. It is conceivable that the alteration in magnitude coupled with changes in the spatial characteristics of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal contributes to both the defect in fluid secretion and downstream cellular changes to ultimately result in the progression of disease.</p>
<p>We investigated whether changes in the secretory machinery <italic>per se</italic> were altered in DMXAA-treated animals to result in hyposecretion. Salivary gland fluid secretion is dependent on TMEM16a facilitating CI<sup>-</sup> flux across the apical PM as the driving force for water transport paracellularly and through AQP5 (Antonella Caputo, 2008; Soren Nielsen &amp; Birgitte Monster Christensen, 1997; V. Gresz, 2001). The loss of either TMEM16a or AQP5 results in markedly attenuated fluid secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Catalan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Romanenko et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Tsubota et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Zeng et al., 2017</xref>). These findings indicate that alteration in expression level, localization, or regulation of these channels could potentially impact fluid secretion. Notably, in DMXAA-treated mice, the AQP5 expression and localization remain unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4">Supplement 4</xref>), consistent with a study in human labial minor salivary glands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Gresz et al., 2015</xref>). We next examined if TMEM16a channel function was compromised in the model. Our electrophysiological analysis revealed a significant decrease in TMEM16a activity following CCh-induced stimulation. Again, this reduced activity was not the result of overt mislocalization or lower expression levels of the protein (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4C</xref>). Interestingly, although the secretagogue-stimulated TMEM16a was reduced in acinar cells from DMXAA-treated animals, the sensitivity of the channel to direct activation by Ca<sup>2+</sup> in the patch pipette appeared to be unaffected. IP<sub>3</sub>R3 Ca<sup>2+</sup> release channels on the ER are located approximately 50-100 nm from TMEM16a on the PM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Pages et al., 2019</xref>). In this microdomain, confocal microscopy cannot easily distinguish the distinct localization of TMEM16a/IP<sub>3</sub>R, despite their localization on different membranes. However, STED super-resolution microscopy provides a much higher spatial resolution, achieving 20-80 nm to enable the differentiation of proteins within 20-80 nm of each other. Data using STED microscopy, suggest that the microdomain between apical ER IP<sub>3</sub>R3 and apical PM TMEM16a is disrupted in the disease model. The severe fragmentation of ER observed in EM images from DMXAA treated animals also is consistent with an alteration in the relationship between ER and other intracellular domains. TMEM16a activation is sensitive to the local Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal surrounding the channel rather than the global cytoplasmic Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Jin et al., 2016</xref>; Shihab Shah, 2020; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Wang et al., 2020</xref>) and thus it is possible that disruption of this apical microdomain leads to an alteration in the local Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal that the TMEM16a experiences leading to reduced activation and fluid secretion.</p>
<p>While changes in cytosolic [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] are vitally important for stimulating ion flux and hence fluid secretion, Ca<sup>2+</sup> is also critical for numerous other physiological processes in salivary gland acinar cells. We focused on the potential effects of the dysregulated Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal on mitochondrial morphology and function. Secretion is an energy-demanding process, necessitating a constant supply of ATP for numerous functions, including vesicle transport, protein modification, membrane fusion, and maintaining ion gradients. For example, the Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> ATPase pump generates the Na<sup>+</sup> gradient, driving Cl<sup>-</sup> transport into the cytosol of acinar cells through NKCC1, and SERCA pumps replenish ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels. In this context, mitochondria are essential as they provide ATP, regulate Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis, supply metabolic intermediates, and coordinate with the ER to orchestrate cellular functions (Jearmine V’tlmart-Seuwen, 1986; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Martinez et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Messenger, Falkowski, &amp; Groblewski, 2014</xref>). Notably, recent studies have highlighted that mitochondria are abundant and display varied positioning and dynamics in salivary gland cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Porat-Shliom et al., 2019</xref>). In SS patients, there are notable alterations in mitochondrial structure, including swelling and disrupted cristae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Barrera et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Li et al., 2022</xref>). Correspondingly, mitochondrial-related genes, particularly those involved in metabolism, dynamics, and the electron transport complex, are significantly affected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Li et al., 2022</xref>). Our data, employing fluorescent immunostaining and EM, mirrors these findings in DMXAA-treated animals. We observed that mitochondrial morphology is altered such that mitochondria are more swollen and rounded, with dispersed cristae, similar to that reported in human SS patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Barrera et al., 2021</xref>). Since optimal mitochondrial bioenergetics are also dependent on Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals, we assessed mitochondrial function by measuring the mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) using a membrane potential sensitive probe and the OCR using Seahorse technology. Our results show that in the SS mouse model, ΔΨm, which is critical for ATP synthesis, is diminished. While the ATP-linked OCR remained unchanged, both the basal and maximal OCR were reduced. This suggests that mitochondrial functionality is compromised in the disease model, indicating a decreased capacity to respond to additional cellular stress. An intriguing question arises from these findings: are defects in the function of mitochondria a primary cause of fluid secretion loss in SS, or alternatively is this a consequence of disrupted [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> regulation? Moreover, DNA from damaged mitochondria can activate the cGAS/STING pathway, leading to inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Kim, Kim, &amp; Chung, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Yu et al., 2020</xref>). This implies that compromised mitochondria in early SS stages could trigger prolonged inflammation through the STING pathway, potentially contributing to SS progression. Understanding these mechanisms is crucial for developing effective treatments to halt or slow the progression of SS.</p>

<p>The murine model of Sjögren’s syndrome was established through the induction of the STING pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bagavant &amp; Deshmukh, 2020</xref>). Briefly, 8-10 weeks old female C57BL/6J wild type (WT) mice (Jackson Laboratory; Jax 000664) received subcutaneous injections of DMXAA (Vadimezan; GC16280) at a concentration of 25 mg/kg of body weight on both day 0 and day 21 of the experimental timeline (see <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">figure 1</xref>).

<title>Evaluation of saliva production</title>
<p>The mice were fasted for two hours prior to the evaluation of saliva production. The mice were anesthetized with a solution containing Ketamine (10 mg/mL) and Xylazine (1 mg/ml) by intraperitoneal injection (IP) at a dose of 7 μl/gm body weight over 2 minutes. The mouse was placed on a heating pad at 37℃ during experimentation. A Salimetrics Childen’s swab (Salimetrics; Cat. no. 5001.05) was placed within the oral cavity of each mouse. The mice were administered the muscarinic agonist pilocarpine (0.375 mg/kg body weight; Millipore Sigma; P6503) by IP injection. Two minutes after the pilocarpine injection, saliva was collected for the following 15 minutes. The saliva absorbed was subsequently separated from the moist swab through centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 1 minute. The measurement of saliva weight served as a quantitative evaluation of the efficacy of whole saliva secretion. To measure neurotransmitter-stimulated saliva secretion more directly, the mouse was anesthetized as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Takano et al., 2021</xref>) and a surgical incision was made in the skin to expose the submandibular gland (SMG). The surrounding connective tissue was excised to facilitate positioning within a custom-made 3D-printed gland holder. A pair of stimulation electrodes were attached to the duct bundle and the SMG. The pre-weighed filter paper was positioned within the oral cavity of the mouse to capture saliva secretion. Secretion was initiated by electrical stimulation sequences generated by a stimulus isolator (Iso-flex, A.M.P.I.) set at 5 mA, 200 ms, at frequencies of 1, 3, 5, 7, and 10 Hz with train frequency and duration (typically 1 minute) controlled by a train generator (DG2A, Warner Instruments). The interval between each stimulus was 3 minutes. After stimulation, the filter paper was removed and weighed. The difference between the weight of filter paper before and after the electrode stimulation represented the saliva produced by the respective salivary gland during the given stimulation period.</p>

<title>Immunofluorescent staining for sliced tissue</title>
<p>Following verification of decreased saliva secretion in mice, glands were processed for immunocytochemistry. Briefly, the isolated salivary glands were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde at 4℃ overnight. The fixed gland was processed, embedded in paraffin, and subsequently sliced into 5 μm thick sections. Two temperature-induced antigen retrieval protocols were used either based on HIER buffer (10 mM Tris-base, 1 mM EDTA-dehydrate, pH 9.2) or sodium citrate buffer (10 mM sodium citrate, 0.05% Tween 20, pH 6.0). Gland sections were blocked with the 10% donkey serum in 0.2% PBSA (PBS+ BSA) at room temperature (RT) for 1 hour. Sections were incubated with the primary antibody at 4℃ overnight (TMEM16a (Millipore Sigma; P6593; 1:250), Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> ATPase (Abcam; ab2872; 1:250), ATP5A (Abcam; ab14748; 1:500), AQP5 (Abcam; ab239904; 1:500), STING (Cell signaling Technology, Cat. 13647; 1:500)).

<p>3D STED microscopy was performed using an Abberior Instruments Expert Line STED microscope equipped with an Olympus UPLSAPO ×100/1.4NA oil immersion objective. Briefly, lobules &lt;1 mm were isolated following injection of saline beneath the capsule with a 29-gauge needle. The connecting tissue was digested in 0.1 mg/ml collagenase containing image buffer at 37℃ for 5 minutes. Then isolated lobules were fixed in 100% methanone at -20℃ for 5 minutes, and subsequently were blocked with 10% BSA in 0.1% PBST (PBS+ 0.1% Tween20) at RT for 1 hour with a gentle shake. TMEM16a was labeled with anti-TMEM16a primary antibody (Millipore Sigma; P6593; 1:300) and STAR RED, goat anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody (Abberior, Cat#STRED-1001-500UG; 1:1000). IP<sub>3</sub>R3 were labeled with anti-IP<sub>3</sub>R3 primary antibody (BD Transduction Laboratory; Cat. 610313; 1:200) and Alexa Fluor 594 anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody (Molecular Probes Cat#A-11037; 1:1000). The tissue was mounted on the slides with Prolong<sup>TM</sup> Gold antifade reagent (Invitrogen; Cat. P36930. Sequential confocal and STED images were obtained following excitation of Alexa Fluor 594 and STAR RED by 594 and 640 nm lasers, respectively. Both fluorophores were depleted in three dimensions with a 775 nm pulsed STED laser. Z-stacks were obtained by collecting images at 50 nm intervals using the 3D STED mode.

<title>Seahorse XF cell mito stress assay</title>
<p>Isolated SMGs were finely minced and subsequently resuspended in a solution composed of 0.5% Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) in Hank’s Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS). To isolate acinar cells, the minced tissue was incubated in 0.5% BSA/HBSS containing 0.2 mg/ml of collagenase type II (Worthington; LS004204) for 30 minutes. Following this incubation, the suspension of cells was centrifuged at 500 rpm for 1 minute and the cellular pellet was then resuspended in 40 μg/ml of Trypsin inhibitor (Millipore; Cat. 65035) to terminate further digestion. The function of mitochondria was assessed in isolated acinar cells by measurement of oxygen consumption rate (OCR) employing a Seahorse XF Cell Mito Stress Test system (Agilent, USA). Briefly, 10 μl of acinar cells were seeded into individual wells of Seahorse cell culture microplates and the OCR was determined utilizing the Seahorse XFe96 extracellular flux analyzer following sequential exposure to 4μg/ml oligomycin (Millipore Sigma; O4876), 4µM carbonyl cyanide-4 (trifluoromethoxy)phenylhydrazone (FCCP; Millipore Sigma; C2920), and 0.5 µM rotenone/antimycin (Millipore Sigma; R8875; A8674) to measure the quantification of basal respiration, ATP-linked respiration, and maximum respiration rate, respectively.

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors address cellular mechanisms underlying the early stages of Sjogren's syndrome, using a mouse model in which 5,6-Dimethyl-9-oxo-9H-xanthene-4-acetic acid (DMXAA) is applied to stimulate the interferon gene (STING) pathway. They show that, in this model, salivary secretion in response to neural stimulation is greatly reduced, even though individual secretory cell calcium responses were enhanced. They attribute the secretion defect to reduced activation of Ca2+ -activated Cl- channels (TMEM16a), due to an increased distance between Ca2+ release channels (IP3 receptors) and TMEM16a which is expected to reduce the [Ca2+] sensed by TMEM16a. A variety of disruptions in mitochondria were also observed after DMXAA treatment, including reduced abundance, altered morphology, depolarization, and reduced oxygen consumption rate. The results of this study shed new light on some of the early events leading to the loss of secretory function in Sjogren's syndrome, at a time before inflammatory responses cause the death of secretory cells.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Two-photon microscopy enabled Ca2+ measurements in the salivary glands of intact animals in response to physiological stimuli (nerve stimulation). This approach has been shown previously by the authors as necessary to preserve the normal spatiotemporal organization of calcium signals that lead to secretion under physiological conditions.</p>
<p>Superresolution (STED) microscopy allowed precise measurements of the spacing of IP3R and TMEM16a and the cell membranes that would otherwise be prevented by the diffraction limit. The measured increase of distance (from 84 to 155 nm) would be expected to reduce [Ca2+] at the TMEM16a channel.</p>
<p>The authors effectively ruled out a variety of alternative explanations for reduced secretion, including changes in AQP5 expression, TMEM16a expression, localization, and Ca2+ sensitivity as indicated by Cl- current in response to defined levels of Ca2+.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>While the Ca2+ distribution in the cells was less restricted to the apical region in DMXAA-treated cells, it is not clear that this is relevant to the reduced activation of TMEM16a. The way in which the change in Ca2+ distribution is quantified (apical/basal ratio) is not informative, as this is not what activates TMEM16a, but rather the local [Ca2+] at the channel.</p>
<p>Despite the decreased level of secretion, Ca2+ signal amplitudes were higher in the treated cells, raising the question of how much this might compensate for the increased distance between IP3R and TMEM16a. The authors assume that the increased separation of IP3R and TMEM16a (and the resulting decrease in local [Ca2+]) outweighed the effect of higher global [Ca2+], but this important point was not addressed.</p>
<p>The description of mitochondrial changes in abundance, morphology, membrane potential, and oxygen consumption rate were not well integrated into the rest of the paper. While they may be a facet of the multiple effects of STING activation and may occur during Sjogren's syndrome, their possible role in reducing secretion was not examined. As it stands, the mitochondrial results are largely descriptive and there is no evidence here that they contribute to the secretory phenotype.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This manuscript describes a very eloquent study of disrupted stimulus-secretion coupling in salivary acinar cells in the early stages of an animal model (DMXAA) of Sjogren's syndrome (SS). The study utilizes a range of technically innovative in vivo imaging of Ca signaling, in vivo salivary secretion, patch clamp electrophysiology to assess TMEM16a activity, immunofluorescence and electron microscopy, and a range of morphological and functional assays of mitochondrial function. Results show that in mice with DMXAA-induced Sjogren's syndrome, there was a reduced nerve-stimulation-induced salivary secretion, yet surprisingly the nerve-stimulation-induced Ca signaling was enhanced. There was also a reduced carbachol (CCh)-induced activation of TMEM16a currents in acinar cells from DMXAA-induced SS mice, whereas the intrinsic Ca-activated TMEM16a currents were unaltered, further supporting that stimulus-secretion coupling was impaired. Consistent with this, high-resolution STED microscopy revealed that there was a loss of close physical spatial coupling between IP3Rs and TMEM16a, which may contribute to the impaired stimulus-secretion coupling. Furthermore, the authors show that the mitochondria were both morphologically and functionally impaired, suggesting that bioenergetics may be impaired in salivary acinar cells of DMXAA-induced SS mice.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Overall, this is an outstanding manuscript, that will have a huge impact on the field. The manuscript is beautifully well-written with a very clear narrative. The experiments are technically innovative, very well executed, and with a logical design The data are very well presented and appropriately analyzed and interpreted.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The pathomechanism underlying Sjögren's syndrome (SS) remains elusive. The authors have studied if altered calcium signaling might be a factor in SS development in a commonly used mouse model. They provide a thorough and straightforward characterization of the salivary gland fluid secretion, cytoplasmic calcium signaling, mitochondrial morphology, and respiration. A special strength of the study is the spectacular in vivo imaging, very few if any groups could have succeeded with the studies. The authors show that the cytoplasmic calcium signaling is upregulated in the SS model and the Ca2+ regulated Cl- channels are normally localized and function, but still fluid secretion is suppressed. They also find altered localization of the IP3R and speculate about lesser exposure of Cl- channels to high local [Ca2+]. In addition, they describe changes in mitochondrial morphology and function that might also contribute to the attenuated secretory response. Although the exact contribution of calcium and mitochondria to secretory dysfunction remains to be determined, the results seem to be useful for a range of scientists.</p>
<p>Specific points to consider:</p>
<p>(1) Are all the effects of DMXAA mediated through STING? DMXAA has been reported to inhibit NAD(P)H quinone oxidoreductase (NQO1) PMID: 10423172, which might be relevant both for the calcium and mitochondrial phenotypes. I would recommend that the authors either test the dependency of the DMXAA effects on STING or avoid attributing all effects of DMXAA to STING.</p>
<p>(2) &quot;mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm), the driving force of ATP production&quot; the driving force is the electrochemical H+ gradient.</p>
<p>(3) ΔΨm is assessed as decreased in the DMXAA model without a change in TMRE steady state. Higher post-uncoupler fluorescence caused a lesser uncoupler-sensitive pool. This is not a very common observation. Was the autofluorescence of the DMXAA-treated cells higher in the red channel?</p>
<p>(4) The EM study indicated ER structure disruption. Are there any clues to the contribution of this to the augmented agonist/electrical stimulation-induced calcium signaling and decreased fluid secretion?</p>
