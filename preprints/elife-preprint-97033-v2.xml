<title>Abstract</title><p>Classical G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling takes place in response to extracellular stimuli and involves receptors and heterotrimeric G proteins located at the plasma membrane. It has recently been established that GPCR signaling can also take place from intracellular membrane compartments, including endosomes that contain internalized receptors and ligands. While the mechanisms of GPCR endocytosis are well understood, it is not clear how well internalized receptors are supplied with G proteins. To address this gap we use gene editing, confocal microscopy, and bioluminescence resonance energy transfer to study the distribution and trafficking of endogenous G proteins. We show here that constitutive endocytosis is sufficient to supply newly internalized endocytic vesicles with 20-30% of the G protein density found at the plasma membrane. We find that G proteins are present on early, late, and recycling endosomes, are abundant on lysosomes, but are virtually undetectable on the endoplasmic reticulum, mitochondria, and the medial Golgi apparatus. Receptor activation does not change heterotrimer abundance on endosomes. Our findings provide a subcellular map of endogenous G protein distribution, suggest that G proteins may be partially excluded from nascent endocytic vesicles, and are likely to have implications for GPCR signaling from endosomes and other intracellular compartments.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Heterotrimeric G proteins transduce a vast number of important physiological signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Gilman, 1987</xref>), most often in response to activation by G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Pierce et al., 2002</xref>). Canonical G protein signaling occurs when a cell surface GPCR is activated by an extracellular ligand, which in turn promotes activation of plasma membrane G protein heterotrimers and downstream effectors. Recently, it has become clear that GPCRs can also signal from intracellular compartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Calebiro et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Eichel &amp; von Zastrow, 2018</xref>), most notably endosomes and the Golgi apparatus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Calebiro et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Ferrandon et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Irannejad et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Irannejad et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Mullershausen et al., 2009</xref>). Signaling from endosomes is often a continuation of signaling that starts at the plasma membrane and persists as (or resumes after) active receptors are endocytosed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Tsvetanova et al., 2015</xref>). Much is known about the machinery responsible for GPCR internalization, and also about the trafficking itineraries of specific receptors after endocytosis. Some receptors are efficiently sorted for recycling and are returned to the plasma membrane, whereas other receptors are rapidly degraded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Hanyaloglu &amp; von Zastrow, 2008</xref>). It is also known that at least one isoform of the G protein effector adenylyl cyclase is actively internalized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Lazar et al., 2020</xref>).</p>
<p>In contrast, much less is known about how G protein heterotrimers traffic from the plasma membrane through intracellular compartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Wedegaertner, 2012</xref>). It is not known how efficiently heterotrimers are loaded onto endocytic vesicles at the plasma membrane, how receptor activation might change this process, or what the fate of G proteins might be after endocytosis. Activation at the plasma membrane promotes heterotrimer dissociation, and the resulting loss of membrane avidity allows Gβγ dimers and some Gα subunits (most notably Gα<sub>s</sub>) to translocate through the cytosol to sample intracellular membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Akgoz et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Hynes et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Ransnäs et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Slepak &amp; Hurley, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Wedegaertner et al., 1996</xref>). However, these processes reverse quickly when activation ceases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Akgoz et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Martin &amp; Lambert, 2016</xref>), meaning that activation-dependent translocation of free Gα subunits and Gβγ dimers would be an inefficient mechanism to deliver inactive heterotrimers to intracellular membranes. G proteins have been detected on the surface of endosomes and other intracellular compartments using a variety of approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Hewavitharana &amp; Wedegaertner, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Irannejad et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Scarselli &amp; Donaldson, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Wedegaertner, 2012</xref>). However, there has been no quantitative comparison of G protein distribution across identified subcellular compartments. Studies of endogenous G proteins are limited by the availability of well-validated antibodies suitable for immunostaining, and overexpression of tagged G protein subunits may lead to aberrant localization.</p>
<p>Here we study the subcellular distribution of endogenous heterotrimeric G proteins in cultured cells using CRISPR-mediated gene editing, confocal imaging, and bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET). We find that G proteins are abundant on membrane compartments that are functionally continuous with the plasma membrane, including early, late, and recycling endosomes. However, heterotrimer density on endocytic membranes is lower than on the plasma membrane, suggesting that G protein endocytosis is inefficient. Endocytic trafficking of G proteins is not regulated by GPCRs. Our findings are likely to have implications for GPCR signaling from endosomes, as internalized receptors are concentrated in G protein-deficient compartments.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>To study the localization of endogenous G proteins we used gene editing to attach small peptide tags to the amino terminus of Gβ<sub>1</sub> subunits (<italic>GNB1</italic>) in HEK 293 cells. We chose this subunit because it is the most abundant Gβ subunit in this cell type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Cho et al., 2022</xref>), it can associate with any type of Gα or Gγ subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Hillenbrand et al., 2015</xref>), and it can be labeled at this position without disrupting heterotrimer formation or function. For bioluminescence experiments we added the HiBit tag (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Schwinn et al., 2018</xref>) and isolated clonal “HiBit-β<sub>1</sub>“ cell lines. An advantage of this approach over adding a full-length Nanoluc luciferase is that it requires coexpression of LgBit to produce a complemented luciferase. This limits luminescence to cotransfected cells and thus eliminates background from untransfected cells. For imaging experiments we added a tandem tag that included the 11<sup>th</sup> beta strand of mNeonGreen2 (mNG2(11)) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Feng et al., 2017</xref>) and HiBit in cells constitutively expressing mNG2(1-10) and isolated “mNG-β<sub>1</sub>“ cell lines (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). Amplicon sequencing verified that cell lines had correctly edited <italic>GNB1</italic> genes and SDS-PAGE revealed single proteins with apparent molecular weights consistent with edited Gβ<sub>1</sub> subunits (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). BRET assays demonstrated that tagged subunits in HiBit-β<sub>1</sub> and mNG-β<sub>1</sub> cell lines formed functional heterotrimers with endogenous Gα and Gγ subunits. For example, we observed agonist-induced BRET between the D2 dopamine receptor and mNG-β<sub>1</sub>, an interaction that requires association with endogenous Gα subunits (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). Similarly, we observed BRET between HiBit-β<sub>1</sub> and the free Gβγ sensor memGRKct-Venus after activation of receptors that couple G<sub>i/o</sub>, G<sub>s</sub>, and G<sub>q</sub> heterotrimers, indicating that HiBit-β<sub>1</sub> associated with endogenous Gα subunits from these three families (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>). We also found that cyclic AMP accumulation in response to stimulation of endogenous β adrenergic receptors was similar in edited cell lines and their unedited parent lines (Figure 1 – figure supplement 1). Endogenous Gα and Gβ subunits are expressed at approximately a 1:1 ratio, and Gβ subunits are tightly associated with Gγ and inactive Gα subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Cho et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Gilman, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Krumins &amp; Gilman, 2006</xref>). Moreover, proteins that bind to free Gβγ dimers are found in the cytosol of unstimulated HEK 293 cells, suggesting at most only a small population of free Gβγ in these cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Barak et al., 1999</xref>). Therefore, we assume that almost all mNG-β<sub>1</sub> and HiBit-β<sub>1</sub> subunits in unstimulated cells are part of heterotrimers.</p>

<title>Endogenous G proteins primarily associate with the plasma membrane and endolysosomes</title>
<p>Confocal imaging of mNG-β<sub>1</sub> cells revealed the expected bright fluorescence at the plasma membrane. Most cells also contained pleiomorphic intracellular structures and dim cytosolic fluorescence that was sufficient to suggest relative exclusion of mNG-β<sub>1</sub> from the nucleus. Especially notable were clusters of large vesicular structures located at the cell periphery which were later identified as lysosomes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>; see below). Large intracellular organelles such as the endoplasmic reticulum, mitochondria, and Golgi apparatus were not evident. Unsurprisingly, our images are quite similar to those made as part of previous study that labeled Gβ<sub>1</sub> subunits with mNG2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Cho et al., 2022</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>To identify the intracellular membrane compartments with mNG-β<sub>1</sub> fluorescence we coexpressed a series of organelle markers tagged with red fluorescent proteins. Markers of the endoplasmic reticulum, mitochondria and medial Golgi apparatus indicated that these large compartments were virtually devoid of mNG-β<sub>1</sub> fluorescence (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B-D</xref>, Figure 2 – figure supplements 1-3). In some cells an indistinct region of mNG-β<sub>1</sub> fluorescence was interleaved with leaflets of the Golgi apparatus, but line profiles suggested that this was a distinct structure (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>, Figure 2 – figure supplement 3), most likely the perinuclear recycling compartment (see below).</p>
<p>In contrast, mNG-β<sub>1</sub> clearly colocalized with the marker FYVE, which binds to phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate (PI3P) on the surface of endosomes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>, B, Figure 3 – figure supplement 1). However, mNG-β<sub>1</sub> fluorescence was not detected on every FYVE-positive vesicle and when present was much less intense than fluorescence of adjacent segments of the plasma membrane (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). The median signal-to-background ratio for FYVE-positive structures was less than one-fourth that of the plasma membrane (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>). FYVE domains primarily localize to early endosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Hammond &amp; Balla, 2015</xref>), so it was not surprising that similar colocalization of mNG-β<sub>1</sub> was observed with the early endosome marker rab5a. As was the case with FYVE, mNG-β<sub>1</sub> was detectable in some rab5a-positive vesicles but not others and was not as intense as the nearby plasma membrane (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>, C, Figure 3 – figure supplement 2). In order to determine the fate of G proteins after endocytosis we then examined mNG-β<sub>1</sub> colocalization with markers of recycling and late endosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Stenmark, 2009</xref>). Dim mNG-β<sub>1</sub> fluorescence was detected on indistinct rab11a-positive structures clustered diffusely in the vicinity of the nucleus (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>, Figure 3 – figure supplement 3), which we presumptively identified as the perinuclear recycling compartment (PNRC). Similarly, mNG-β<sub>1</sub> colocalized extensively with vesicles labeled with rab7a, a marker of late endosomes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>, Figure 3 – figure supplement 4). Notably, mNG-β<sub>1</sub> fluorescence was more intense on rab7a-positive late endosomes than on FYVE-or rab5a-positive early endosomes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>). The presence of mNG-β<sub>1</sub> on late endosomes suggested that some G proteins may be degraded by lysosomes. Accordingly, mNG-β<sub>1</sub> strongly colocalized with lysosomes marked with LysoView 633 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>, Figure 3 – figure supplement 5), long-term incubation with fluorescent dextran (Figure 3 – figure supplement 5), or the lysosome marker LAMP1 (Figure 3 – figure supplement 6). While some mNG fluorescence was detected in the lumen of lysosomes, much of the signal remained on the cytosolic surface of these structures, and in many instances the intensity of mNG-β<sub>1</sub> fluorescence on lysosomes was similar to that of the nearby plasma membrane (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). We also detected robust mNG-β<sub>1</sub> signals on structures labeled with TGNP (Figure 3 – figure supplement 7), a marker of the trans-Golgi network. These imaging results suggest that G proteins are likely to undergo endocytosis and enter both recycling and degradative pathways and may become more concentrated as late endosomes mature.</p>

<p>As an alternative approach we performed bystander BRET experiments to map the subcellular localization of endogenous HiBit-β<sub>1</sub>. This approach provides an unbiased index of membrane protein colocalization from large populations of cells and has the additional advantage of very high sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Lan et al., 2012</xref>). We expressed LgBit and a series of inert Venus-tagged membrane markers in HiBit-β<sub>1</sub> cells and observed large bystander signals at the plasma membrane, smaller bystander signals at endosomes, and very small bystander signals at the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>). Although bystander BRET signals cannot be directly compared between different compartments, these results are generally consistent with what we observed using confocal imaging and confirm the presence of G proteins on multiple endosomal compartments.</p>

<sec id="s4">
<title>Constitutive G protein endocytosis is inefficient</title>
<p>That mNG-β<sub>1</sub> fluorescence was less intense on endosomes than the plasma membrane suggested that G protein density may be lower on the surface of endosomes than on the plasma membrane. However, differences in fluorescence intensity could also be due to differences in the amount of membrane surface area sampled in the imaging volume. Likewise, differences in bystander BRET between compartments could be due to differences in several factors, including expression and efficiency of compartment-specific BRET acceptors. Therefore, we devised a co-labeling protocol that allowed us to compare mNG-β<sub>1</sub> fluorescence to the amount of newly internalized membrane imaged at endocytic vesicles, and to simultaneously make the same measurements at the plasma membrane. To stain both the plasma membrane as well as newly formed endocytic vesicle membrane we exposed live cells to the styryl dye FM4-64, which rapidly and reversibly partitions into (but does not cross) membranes and is only fluorescent in a hydrophobic environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Betz et al., 1996</xref>). When cells are exposed to FM4-64 at physiological temperatures the plasma membrane is stained immediately, and this is followed over the course of several minutes by the appearance of intracellular vesicles that have trapped the dye (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>, Figure 4 – figure supplement 1). As an orthogonal approach we stained cells with CellMask Deep Red, a lipophilic dye that permanently stains the plasma membrane and therefore is incorporated into endocytic vesicles. Both dyes are expected to produce fluorescence signals proportional to the surface area of the membrane sampled by the imaging method, allowing us to normalize the fluorescence of individual vesicles to the nearby plasma membrane. We reasoned that if G proteins are passively incorporated into endocytic vesicles without any enrichment or exclusion, then mNG-β<sub>1</sub> fluorescence in each vesicle should have the same intensity relative to the plasma membrane as lipophilic dyes. After staining cells and allowing 15 minutes for constitutive endocytosis we found that FM4-64 and CellMask dyes reported similar amounts of membrane surface area in endocytic vesicles (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>, B); in both cases peak vesicle intensity was on average similar to the intensity of the plasma membrane (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>). In contrast, peak mNG-β<sub>1</sub> fluorescence on the same endocytic vesicles was much less intense than the plasma membrane (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A-C</xref>). There was considerable variability between individual vesicles, such that some vesicles contained no detectable mNG-β<sub>1</sub> fluorescence (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>, Figure 4 – figure supplement 1). Using FM4-64 fluorescence as a standard for membrane surface area we calculated that mNG-β<sub>1</sub> density on FM4-64-positive vesicles was 20 ± 8% (mean ± 95% CI; <italic>n</italic>=45) of the nearby plasma membrane. This result confirms that heterotrimeric G proteins are present on newly internalized membrane but also suggests that G proteins are partially excluded from endocytic vesicles. To test if other peripheral membrane proteins are similarly depleted from endocytic vesicles, we performed analogous experiments by overexpressing mNG bearing the C-terminal membrane anchor of HRas (mNG-HRas ct). We found that mNG-HRas ct was also less abundant on FM4-64-positive endocytic vesicles than on the plasma membrane, although not to the same extent as mNG-β1 (Figure 4 – figure supplement 2); mNG-HRas ct density on FM4-64-positive vesicles was 64 ± 17% (mean ± 95% CI; <italic>n</italic>=78) of the nearby plasma membrane.</p>

<title>Receptor activation does not change G protein endocytosis</title>
<p>The above results suggested that constitutive endocytosis of heterotrimeric G proteins is inefficient. However, it is possible that GPCR and G protein activation could change how G proteins are loaded onto endocytic vesicles. To test this possibility, we performed similar imaging experiments with mNG-β<sub>1</sub> cells transfected with SNAP-tagged β<sub>2</sub> adrenergic receptors (SNAPf-β<sub>2</sub>AR). This receptor is often used as a model of activity-dependent GPCR internalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Benovic et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">von Zastrow &amp; Kobilka, 1992</xref>) and has been shown to activate G proteins on endosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bowman et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Irannejad et al., 2013</xref>). We labeled SNAPf-β<sub>2</sub>AR with a membrane-impermeant SNAP ligand (AF 647) at room temperature to prevent constitutive endocytosis, then incubated cells with FM4-64 and the agonist isoproterenol for 15 minutes at physiological temperature to promote receptor endocytosis. Confocal imaging after agonist washout revealed numerous intracellular vesicles with intense AF 647 fluorescence, consistent with robust receptor internalization (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). Normalization and comparison to FM4-64 fluorescence indicated that SNAPf-β<sub>2</sub>AR was enriched approximately three-fold on endocytic vesicles compared to the nearby plasma membrane (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>, C), consistent with active recruitment of active receptors to clathrin-coated pits and endocytic vesicles. In contrast, mNG-β<sub>1</sub> fluorescence in the same vesicles was again lower than expected given the amount of membrane imaged in each vesicle (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>, C). Once again there was considerable variability between individual endocytic vesicles (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>, D). Using FM4-64 fluorescence as a standard for membrane surface area we calculated that mNG-β<sub>1</sub> density on receptor-containing vesicles was 28 ± 8% (mean ± 95% CI; <italic>n</italic>=91) of the nearby plasma membrane. Although this density was higher than that calculated for vesicles formed by constitutive endocytosis, the difference did not reach significance (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>). These results demonstrate that activation-dependent internalization of β<sub>2</sub> adrenergic receptors does not significantly promote or prevent loading of G proteins onto endocytic vesicles.</p>

<p>These findings suggested that β<sub>2</sub> adrenergic receptor activation should have no impact on the abundance of heterotrimeric G proteins on endosomes. To test this idea for this and other receptors, we performed bystander BRET experiments with HiBit-β<sub>1</sub> cells transiently expressing β<sub>2</sub> adrenergic, D2 dopamine or M3 muscarinic receptors to activate G<sub>s</sub>, G<sub>i/o</sub> and G<sub>q/11</sub> heterotrimers, respectively. With overexpressed G proteins free Gβγ dimers translocate from the plasma membrane and sample intracellular membrane compartments when dissociated from Gα subunits. Consistent with this, we observed small decreases in bystander BRET at the plasma membrane and small increases in bystander BRET at intracellular compartments during activation of GPCRs, suggesting that endogenous Gβγ subunits undergo similar translocation (Figure 5 – figure supplement 1). Notably, these changes occurred at room temperature, suggesting that endocytosis was not involved, and developed over the course of minutes. The latter observation and the small magnitude of agonist-induced changes are both consistent with expression of primarily slowly-translocating endogenous Gγ subtypes in HEK 293 cells. Moreover, as shown previously for overexpressed Gβγ, the changes we observed with endogenous Gβγ were readily reversible (Figure 5 – figure supplement 1), suggesting that most heterotrimers reassemble at the plasma membrane after activation ceases. In order to assess changes in heterotrimer trafficking to endosomes without interference from Gβγ translocation we incubated cells with agonist under conditions permissive for vesicular trafficking, then washed with antagonist to inactivate receptors and allow heterotrimers to reassemble prior to measuring BRET. Under these conditions no significant changes in bystander BRET were observed at any endosome compartment after 30 minutes of receptor stimulation (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref>). Similar results were obtained when stimulation was maintained for 15 minutes or 5 minutes (Figure 5 – figure supplement 2), although small increases were apparent in a few instances. Taken together these results indicate that activation of receptors and G proteins does not substantially change heterotrimer abundance on the surface of endosomes.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>While the mechanisms involved in the biosynthesis, chaperoning and trafficking of nascent G protein heterotrimers are fairly well understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Gabay et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Marrari et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Wedegaertner, 2012</xref>), the mechanisms that regulate the subcellular distribution of heterotrimers after delivery to the plasma membrane have not been studied as extensively. Here we show that constitutive and activity-dependent endocytosis of G proteins is inefficient. Avoidance of endocytosis is likely to be important for maintaining a high density of heterotrimers at the plasma membrane, where much important signaling takes place. On the other hand, this limits the abundance of G proteins on the surface of endosomes. At present we can only speculate regarding the mechanism that limits G protein density on endocytic vesicles. Many endocytosis mechanisms, including clathrin-mediated endocytosis, rely on bulky coat proteins and adapters to induce membrane curvature and recruit cargo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Doherty &amp; McMahon, 2009</xref>). One possibility is that heterotrimeric G proteins are simply excluded from nascent endocytic vesicles by steric occlusion. While large extracellular domains are known to impede endocytosis of membrane proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">DeGroot et al., 2018</xref>), a similar relationship has not been demonstrated for intracellular domains. Our finding that the small mNG-HRas ct probe is loaded onto endocytic vesicles more efficiently than mNG-β<sub>1</sub>-containing heterotrimers is consistent with this idea. It is noteworthy that the monomeric G proteins HRas and NRas are also less abundant on endosomes than the plasma membrane, and therefore are separated from internalized growth factor receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Pinilla-Macua et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Surve et al., 2021</xref>).</p>
<p>Some studies using overexpressed G protein subunits have suggested that a large pool of G proteins is located on intracellular membranes, including the Golgi apparatus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Chisari et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Saini et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Tsutsumi et al., 2009</xref>), whereas others have indicated a distribution that is dominated by the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Crouthamel et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Evanko et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Marrari et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Takida &amp; Wedegaertner, 2003</xref>). A likely factor contributing to these discrepant results is the stoichiometry of overexpressed subunits, as neither Gα nor Gβγ traffic appropriately to the plasma membrane as free subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Wedegaertner, 2012</xref>). Our gene-editing approach presumably maintains the native subunit stoichiometry, providing a more accurate representation of native G protein distribution. Our results show that endogenous G proteins are primarily located on the plasma membrane and are present on internal membranes at substantially lower levels. We identify the specific intracellular compartments where G proteins are found and show the relative abundance of G proteins on each compartment. Nascent heterotrimers are likely formed and lipid modified on the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Wedegaertner, 2012</xref>), yet few heterotrimers can be found on these compartments at any given moment, consistent with a relatively slow rate of turnover compared to forward trafficking during biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Gabay et al., 2011</xref>). Notably, when Gβγ dimers are expressed alone they accumulate on the endoplasmic reticulum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Michaelson et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Takida &amp; Wedegaertner, 2003</xref>). That we detect almost no endogenous Gβγ on the endoplasmic reticulum supports our conclusion that the large majority of Gβγ in unstimulated HEK 293 cells is associated with Gα. Likewise, we found that few heterotrimers are associated with mitochondria, despite the fact that previous studies have demonstrated functional roles for G proteins on these organelles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Hewavitharana &amp; Wedegaertner, 2012</xref>). Our results suggest that GPCR signaling from intracellular compartments will generally have to be transduced by a lower density of G proteins. Consistent with these findings, a recent large-scale study assessing protein abundance on organelles in HEK 293 cells found that Gβ<sub>1</sub> is enriched on the plasma membrane and lysosomes but is not significantly enriched on endosomes, the Golgi apparatus, endoplasmic reticulum or mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Hein et al., 2023</xref>).</p>
<p>Fully lipid-modified heterotrimers in their inactive state are unlikely to detach from membranes at a significant rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Shahinian &amp; Silvius, 1995</xref>). Therefore, we infer from the presence of Gβ<sub>1</sub> on early, late, and recycling endosomes that heterotrimers undergo vesicle-mediated endocytosis in unstimulated cells and are not efficiently sorted to either the slow recycling pathway or the degradative pathway. Our imaging results also show that G proteins are apparently more abundant on late endosomes and lysosomes than on early endosomes, suggesting that they become concentrated as late endosomes mature. We do not know the fate of G proteins located on the surface of lysosomes. Since lysosomes may fuse with the plasma membrane under certain circumstances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Xu &amp; Ren, 2015</xref>), it is possible that this represents a route of G protein recycling to the plasma membrane. Our results are largely consistent with the hypothesis that G proteins passively follow bulk endocytic flow of membrane and suggest that at least some G proteins are recycled to the plasma membrane. We also cannot exclude the possibility that heterotrimers traffic between membrane compartments by mechanisms other than vesicular trafficking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Saini et al., 2009</xref>). However, even if this is the case our conclusions that G proteins are internalized inefficiently and are present at lower density on most intracellular membranes are still valid.</p>
<p>Tagging endogenous proteins with HiBit and other luciferase fragments has proven to be useful for studying several aspects of GPCR signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">White et al., 2020</xref>). The cell lines we developed should prove useful for answering additional questions related to G protein regulation, such as possible non-vesicular translocation due to palmitate turnover (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Saini et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Wedegaertner &amp; Bourne, 1994</xref>), the role of ubiquitination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Dohlman &amp; Campbell, 2019</xref>), and localization in subcompartments not studied here. In addition, it may also be possible to use these cells in combination with targeted sensors to study endogenous G protein activation in different subcellular compartments. More broadly, our results show that subcellular localization of endogenous membrane proteins can be studied in living cells by adding a HiBit tag and performing bystander BRET mapping. Applied at large scale this approach would have some advantages over fluorescent protein complementation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Cho et al., 2022</xref>), most notably the ability to localize endogenous membrane proteins that are expressed at levels that are too low to permit fluorescence microscopy.</p>
<p>Our study is not without limitations. Our labeling strategy was designed to interfere as little as possible with heterotrimer function, but we cannot rule out the possibility that the tags we used to visualize and track G proteins had some influence on their trafficking. By labeling Gβ<sub>1</sub> subunits we cannot directly distinguish heterotrimers from free Gβγ dimers, complicating interpretation. This strategy also does not allow us to resolve heterotrimers containing different Gα subunits. It is quite possible that heterotrimers containing different Gα subunits could be subject to different trafficking mechanisms. Our conclusion that GPCR activation has no lasting effect on the subcellular distribution of G proteins rests on three representative receptors, chosen because they activate three of the four major G protein families. It is possible that other receptors will influence G protein distribution using mechanisms not shared by the receptors we studied. For example, a few receptors are thought to form relatively stable complexes with Gβγ, which could provide a mechanism of trafficking to endosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Thomsen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Wehbi et al., 2013</xref>). Finally, our study was limited to a single non-differentiated cell type. It would not be surprising to find that differentiated cells have mechanisms to regulate G protein trafficking and distribution that are not shared by the model cells we used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Calebiro et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Kotowski et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Lin et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Puri et al., 2022</xref>).</p>
<p>In summary, here we show that heterotrimeric G proteins are more abundant on the plasma membrane than on any intracellular compartment where they are thought to be important for signaling. Our results are likely to have functional implications for signaling from intracellular compartments. Receptor-G protein coupling is thought to be rate-limited by collision and G protein abundance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Hein et al., 2005</xref>), and decreasing G protein expression is known to impair downstream signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Gabay et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Schwindinger et al., 1997</xref>). Signaling from endosomes and other compartments may thus be disadvantaged by a low density of G proteins. Further studies are warranted to examine the stoichiometry of receptors, G proteins, regulators, and effectors in different subcellular compartments and how this affects signaling.</p>

For measurements cells were resuspended in Dulbecco’s phosphate buffered saline (DPBS). For long-term agonist stimulation (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref>) HiBit-β<sub>1</sub> cells expressing CMV-LgBit (0.1 μg per well) and either SNAPf-β2AR, SNAPf-D2R or SNAPf-M3R (0.5 μg per well) were incubated with agonist for 30 minutes in the incubator, then washed and resuspended in DPBS containing antagonist prior to reading BRET. Agonists were isoproterenol (10 μM), dopamine (100 μM) and acetylcholine (100 μM); antagonists were ICI 118551 (10 μM), haloperidol (10 μM) and atropine (10 μM); all small molecule ligands were obtained from Millipore Sigma or Cayman Chemical. For functional validation of mNG-β<sub>1</sub> cells, D2R-Nluc (50 ng per well) was transfected, and cells were resuspended in permeabilization buffer (KPS) containing 140 mM KCl, 10 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.1 mM Potassium EGTA, 20 mM NaHEPES (pH 7.2), 10 mg ml<sup>−1</sup> high-purity digitonin and 2U ml<sup>−1</sup> apyrase. Kinetic BRET measurements were made from permeabilized cells during sequential injection of dopamine (100 mM) and GDP (100 mM). For functional validation of HiBit-ý<sub>1</sub> cells, SNAPf-β2AR, SNAPf-D2R or SNAPf-M3R (0.5 μg per well), CMV-LgBit (0.1 μg per well) and memGRK3ct-Venus (0.5 μg per well) were transfected, and cells were resuspended in DPBS. Kinetic BRET measurements were made from intact cells during sequential injection of agonists and antagonists at the concentrations listed above. All BRET measurements were made in buffer solutions containing the substrate furimazine (Promega or ChemShuttle; 1:1,000 from a 5 mM stock dissolved in 90% ethanol/10% glycerol). Steady-state BRET and luminescence measurements were made using a Mithras LB940 photon-counting plate reader (Berthold Technologies GmbH) running MicroWin2000 software. Kinetic BRET measurements were made using a Polarstar Optima plate reader (BMG Labtech) running BMG Optima version 2.20R2 software. Raw BRET signals were calculated as the emission intensity at 520–545 nm divided by the emission intensity at 475–495 nm. Net BRET signals were calculated as the raw BRET signal minus the raw BRET signal measured from cells expressing only the donor.</p>

<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>All statistical testing was carried out using GraphPad Prism version 10.1.1. Comparison of mNG signals in vesicles with and without receptors (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>) was made using an unpaired t-test. Comparison of endosome bystander signals with and without agonist treatment (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref>) was made using paired t-tests with a false discovery rate (FDR) of 1% (method of Benjamini, Krieger and Yekutieli).</p>

<p>This <bold>important</bold> study investigates the intracellular localization patterns of G proteins involved in GPCR signaling, presenting <bold>compelling</bold> evidence for their preference for plasma and lysosomal membranes over endosomal, endoplasmic reticulum, and Golgi membranes. This discovery has significant implications for understanding GPCR action and signaling from intracellular locations. This research will interest cell biologists studying protein trafficking and pharmacologists exploring localized signaling phenomena.</p>

<p>The manuscript by Jang et al. describes the application of new methods to measure the localization GTP-binding signaling proteins (G proteins) on different membrane structures in a model mammalian cell line (HEK293). G proteins mediate signaling by receptors found at the cell surface (GPCRs), with evidence from the last 15 years suggesting that GPCRs can induce G-protein mediated signaling from different membrane structures within the cell, with variation in signal localization leading to different cellular outcomes. While it has been clearly shown that different GPCRs efficiently traffic to various intracellular compartments, it is less clear whether G proteins traffic in the same manor, and whether GPCR trafficking facilitates &quot;passenger&quot; G protein trafficking. This question was a blind spot in the burgeoning field of GPCR localized signaling in need of careful study, and the results obtained will serve as an important guide post for further work in this field.</p>
<p>
The extent to which G proteins localize to different membranes within the cell is the main experimental question tested in this manuscript. This question is pursued by through two distinct methods, both relying on genetic modification of the G-beta subunit with a tag. In one method, G-beta is modified with a small fragment of the fluorescent protein mNG, which combines with the larger mNG fragment to form a fully functional fluorescent protein to facilitate protein trafficking by fluorescent microscopy. This approach was combined with expression of fluorescent proteins directed to various intracellular compartments (different types of endosomes, lysosome, endoplasmic reticulum, golgi, mitochondria) to look for colocalization of G-beta with these markers. These experiments showed compelling evidence that G-beta co-localizes with markers at the plasma membrane and the lysosome, with weak or absent co-localization for other markers. A second method for measuring localization relied on fusing G-beta with a small fragment from a miniature luciferase (HiBit) that combines with a larger luciferase fragment (LgBit) to form an active luciferase enzyme. Localization of G-beta (and luciferase signal) was measured using a method known as bystander BRET, which relies on expression of a fluorescent protein BRET acceptor in different cellular compartments. Results using bystander BRET supported findings from fluorescence microscopy experiments. These methods for tracking G protein localization were also used to probe other questions. The activation of GPCRs from different classes had virtually no impact on the localization of G-beta, suggesting that GPCR activation does not result in shuttling of G proteins through the endosomal pathway with activated receptors.</p>
<p>In the revised version of this manuscript the authors have performed informative and important new experiments in addition to adding new text to address conceptual questions. These new data and discussions are commendable and address most or all of the weaknesses listed in the initial review.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The question probed in this study is quite important and, in my opinion, understudied by the pharmacology community. The results presented here are an important call to be cognizant of the localization of GPCR coupling partners in different cellular compartments. Abundant reports of endosomal GPCR signaling need to consider how the impact of lower G protein abundance on endosomal membranes will affect the signaling responses under study.</p>
<p>*The work presented is carefully executed, with seemingly high levels of technical rigor. These studies benefit from probing the experimental questions at hand using two different methods of measurement (fluorescent microscopy and bystander BRET). The observation that both methods arrive at the same (or a very similar) answer inspires confidence about the validity of these findings.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>*As noted by the authors, they do not demonstrate that the tagged G-beta is predominantly found within heterotrimeric G protein complexes. In the revised manuscript the authors have added new discussion text on why it is likely that G-beta is mostly found in complexes. This line of reasoning is convincing, although more robust experimental methods for assessing the assembly status of G-beta could be a valuable target for future experimental developments.</p>

<p>This study assess the subcellular distribution of a major G protein subunit (Gβ1) when expressed at an endogenous level in a well-studied model cell system (293 cells). The approach elegantly extends a gene editing strategy described by Leonetti's group and combines it with a FRET-based proximity assay to detect the presence of endogenously tagged Gβ1 on membrane compartments of 293 cells. The authors achieve their goal, and the data are convincing and interesting. The authors do a nice job of integrating their results with previous work in the field. The methods are now sufficiently well-described to enable other investigators to apply or adapt them in future studies.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This article addresses an important and interesting question concerning intracellular localization and dynamics of endogenous G proteins. The fate and trafficking of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) have been extensively studied but so far little is known about the trafficking routes of their partner G proteins that are known to dissociate from their respective receptors upon activation of the signaling pathway. Authors utilize modern cell biology tools including genome editing and bystander bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) to probe intracellular localization of G proteins in various membrane compartments in steady state and also upon receptor activation. Data presented in this manuscript shows that while G proteins are mostly present on the plasma membrane, they can be also detected in endosomal compartments, especially in late endosomes and lysosomes. This distribution, according to data presented in this study, seems not to be affected by receptor activation. These findings will have implications in further studies addressing GPCR signaling mechanisms from intracellular compartments.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The methods used in this study are adequate for the question asked. Especially use of genome-edited cells (for addition of the tag on one of the G proteins) is a great choice to prevent effects of overexpression. Moreover, use of bystander BRET allowed authors to probe intracellular localization of G proteins in a very high-throughput fashion. By combining imaging and BRET authors convincingly show that G proteins are very low abundant on early endosomes (also ER, mitochondria, and medial Golgi), however seem to accumulate on membranes of late endosomal compartments. Moreover, authors also looked at the dynamics of G protein trafficking by tracking them over multiple time points in different compartments.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>While authors provide a novel dataset, many questions regarding G protein trafficking remain open. For example, it is not entirely clear which pathway is utilized to traffic G proteins from the plasma membrane to intracellular compartments. Additionally, future studies should also include more quantitative details considering G-protein distribution in different compartments as well as more detailed dynamic data on G protein internalization as well as intracellular trafficking kinetics.</p>

The observation that both methods arrive at the same (or a very similar) answer inspires confidence about the validity of these findings.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The rationale for fusing G-beta with either mNG2(11) or SmBit could benefit from some expansion. I understand the speculation that using the smallest tag possible may have the smallest impact on protein performance and localization, but plenty of researchers have fused proteins with whole fluorescent proteins to provide conclusions that have been confirmed by other methods. Many studies even use G proteins fused with fluorescent proteins or luciferases. Is there an important advantage to tagging G-beta with small tags? Is there evidence that G proteins with full-size protein tags behave aberrantly? If the studies presented here would not have been possible without these CRISPR-based tagging approaches, it would be helpful to provide more context to make this clearer. Perhaps one factor would be interference from newly synthesized G proteins-fluorescent protein fusions en route to the plasma membrane (in the ER and Golgi).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>There are several advantages to using small peptide tags that we did not fully explain. From a practical standpoint the most important advantage of using the HiBit tag instead of full-length Nanoluc is that it allows us to restrict luminescence output to cells transiently transfected with LgBit. In this way untransfected cells contribute no background signal. Although we did not take advantage of it here, this also applies to fluorescent protein complementation, and will be useful for visualizing proteins in individual cells within tissues. The HiBit tag also allows PAGE analysis by probing membranes with LgBit (as in Fig. 1). We are not aware of evidence that tagging Gb or Gg subunits on the N terminus results in aberrant behavior, while there is some evidence that Ga subunits tagged with full-size protein tags (in some positions) have altered functional properties (PMID: 16371464). We do think that editing endogenous genes is critical, as studies using transient overexpression (usually driven by strong promoters) have sometimes reported accumulation of tagged G proteins in the biosynthetic pathway (e.g., PMID: 17576765), as the reviewer suggests. Ga and Gbg appear to be mutually dependent on each other for appropriate trafficking to the plasma membrane (reviewed in PMID: 23161140), therefore the native (presumably matched) stoichiometry is likely to be critical.</p>
<p>To clarify this context the revised manuscript includes the following:</p>
<p>“For bioluminescence experiments we added the HiBit tag (Schwinn et al., 2018) and isolated clonal “HiBit-b1“ cell lines. An advantage of this approach over adding a full-length Nanoluc luciferase is that it requires coexpression of LgBit to produce a complemented luciferase. This limits luminescence to cotransfected cells and thus eliminates background from untransfected cells.”</p>
<p>“Some studies using overexpressed G protein subunits have suggested that a large pool of G proteins is located on intracellular membranes, including the Golgi apparatus (Chisari et al., 2007; Saini et al., 2007; Tsutsumi et al., 2009), whereas others have indicated a distribution that is dominated by the plasma membrane (Crouthamel et al., 2008; Evanko, Thiyagarajan, &amp; Wedegaertner, 2000; Marrari et al., 2007; Takida &amp; Wedegaertner, 2003). A likely factor contributing to these discrepant results is the stoichiometry of overexpressed subunits, as neither Ga nor Gbg traffic appropriately to the plasma membrane as free subunits (Wedegaertner, 2012). Our gene-editing approach presumably maintains the native subunit stoichiometry, providing a more accurate representation of native G protein distribution.”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>As noted by the authors, they do not demonstrate that the tagged G-beta is predominantly found within heterotrimeric G protein complexes. If there is substantial free G-beta, then many of the conclusions need to be reconsidered. Perhaps a comparison of immunoprecipitated tagged G beta vs immunoprecipitated supernatant, with blotting for other G protein subunits would be informative.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We do think that HiBit-b1 exists predominantly within heterotrimeric complexes, for several reasons. First, overexpression studies have shown that Gbg requires association with Ga to traffic to the plasma membrane, and that by itself Gbg is retained on the endoplasmic reticulum</p>
<p>(PMID: 12609996; PMID: 12221133). We find almost no endogenous Gb1 on the endoplasmic reticulum, and a high density on the plasma membrane. Second, we are able to detect large increases in free HiBit-Gbg after G protein activation using free Gbg sensors (e.g. Fig. 1). Third, many proteins that bind to free Gbg are found entirely in the cytosol of HEK 293 cells (e.g. PMID: 10066824), suggesting there is not a large population of free Gbg. We have added discussion of these points to the revised manuscript as follows:</p>
<p>“Endogenous Ga and Gb subunits are expressed at approximately a 1:1 ratio, and Gb subunits are tightly associated with Gg and inactive Ga subunits (Cho et al., 2022; Gilman, 1987; Krumins &amp; Gilman, 2006). Moreover, proteins that bind to free Gbg dimers are found in the cytosol of unstimulated HEK 293 cells, suggesting at most only a small population of free Gbg in these cells. Therefore, we assume that the large majority of mNG-b1 and HiBit-b1 subunits in unstimulated cells are part of heterotrimers.”</p>
<p>“Notably, when Gbg dimers are expressed alone they accumulate on the endoplasmic reticulum</p>
<p>(Michaelson et al., 2002; Takida &amp; Wedegaertner, 2003). That we detect almost no endogenous Gbg on the endoplasmic reticulum supports our conclusion that the large majority of Gbg in unstimulated HEK 293 cells is associated with Ga, although we cannot rule out a small population of free Gbg.”</p>
<p>We do not entirely understand the suggested experiment, as free Gbg will still be largely associated with the membrane fraction. Notably, we find almost no HiBit-b1 in the supernatant after lysis in hypotonic buffer and preparation of membrane fractions, and the small amount that we do find does not change if Ga is overexpressed.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Additional context and questions:</p>
<p>(1) There exists some evidence that certain GPCRs can form enduring complexes with G-betagamma (PubMed: 23297229, 27499021). That would seem to offer a mechanism that would enable receptor-mediated transport of G protein subunits. It would be helpful for the authors to place the findings of this manuscript in the context of these previous findings since they seem somewhat contradictory.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree. In our original submission we noted “It is possible that other receptors will influence G protein distribution using mechanisms not shared by the receptors we studied.” In the revised manuscript we have added:</p>
<p>“For example, a few receptors are thought to form relatively stable complexes with Gbg, which could provide a mechanism of trafficking to endosomes (Thomsen et al., 2016; Wehbi et al., 2013).”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) There is some evidence that GaS undergoes measurable dissociation from the plasma membrane upon activation (see the mechanism of the assay in PubMed: 35302493). It seems possible that G-alpha (and in particular GaS) might behave differently than the G-beta subunit studied here. This is not entirely clear from the discussion as it now stands.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Indeed, there is abundant evidence that some Gas translocates away from the plasma membrane upon activation. We referred to translocation of “some Ga subunits” in the introduction, although we did not specify that Gas is by far the most studied example. In a previous study (PMID: 27528603) we found that overexpressed Gas samples many intracellular membranes upon activation and returns to the plasma membrane when activation ceases. This is similar to activation-dependent translocation of free Gbg dimers. Because these translocation mechanisms depend on activation and are reversible they are unlikely to be a major source of inactive heterotrimers for intracellular membranes.</p>
<p>We did a poor job of making it clear that we intentionally avoided translocation mechanisms that operate only <italic>during</italic> receptor and G protein stimulation. In the revised manuscript we have added new data showing reversible activation-dependent translocation of endogenous HiBitGb1.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) The authors say &quot;The presence of mNG-b1 on late endosomes suggested that some G proteins may be degraded by lysosomes&quot;. The mechanism of lysosomal degradation by proteins on the outside of the lysosome is not clear. It would be helpful for the authors to clarify.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree we didn’t connect the dots here. Our initial idea was that G proteins on the surface of late endosomes might reach the interior of late endosomes and then lysosomes by involution into multivesicular bodies. However, the reviewer correctly points out that much of the G protein associated with lysosomes still appears to be on the cytosolic surface, where it would not be subject to degradation. In fact, since lysosomes can fuse with the plasma membrane under certain circumstances, this could even represent a pathway for recycling G proteins to the plasma membrane.</p>
<p>We have revised the text to avoid giving the impression that lysosomes degrade G proteins, since we have scant evidence that this occurs. In the revised discussion we point out that we do not know the fate of G proteins located on the surface of lysosomes and speculate that these could be returned to the plasma membrane:</p>
<p>“We do not know the fate of G proteins located on the surface of lysosomes. Since lysosomes may fuse with the plasma membrane under certain circumstances (Xu &amp; Ren, 2015), it is possible that this represents a route of G protein recycling to the plasma membrane.”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) Although the authors do a good job of assessing G protein dilution in endosomal membranes, it is unclear how this behavior compares to the measurement of other lipidanchored proteins using the same approach. Is the dilution of G proteins what we would expect for any lipid-anchored protein at the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This is a great question. To begin to address it we have studied a model lipid-anchored protein consisting of mNeongreen2 anchored to the plasma membrane by the C terminus of HRas, which is palmitoylated and prenylated. We find that this protein is also diluted on endocytic vesicles, although to a lesser degree than heterotrimeric G proteins. We have added a section to the results and a new figure supplement describing these results:</p>
<p>“To test if other peripheral membrane proteins are similarly depleted from endocytic vesicles, we performed analogous experiments by overexpressing mNG bearing the C-terminal membrane anchor of HRas (mNG-HRas ct). We found that mNG-HRas ct was also less abundant on FM464-positive endocytic vesicles than expected based on plasma membrane abundance, although not to the same extent as mNG-b1 (Figure 4 - figure supplement 2); mNG-HRas ct density on FM4-64-positive vesicles was 64 ± 17% (mean ± 95% CI; n=78) of the nearby plasma membrane.”</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>This is an interesting method that addresses the important problem of assessing G protein localization at endogenous levels. The data are generally convincing.</p>
<p>Specific comments</p>
<p>Methods:</p>
<p>The description of the gene editing method is unclear. There are two different CRISPR cell lines made in two different cell backgrounds. The methods should clearly state which CRISPR guides were used on which cell line. It is also not clear why HiBit is included in the mNG-β1 construct. Presumably, this is not critical but it would be helpful to explicitly note. In general, the Methods could be more complete.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have added the following to the methods to clarify that the same gRNA was used to produce both cell lines:</p>
<p>“The human GNB1 gene was targeted at a site corresponding to the N-terminus of the Gb1 protein; the sequence 5’-TGAGTGAGCTTGACCAGTTA-3’ was incorporated into the crRNA, and the same gRNA was used to produce both HiBit-b1 and mNG-b1 cell lines.”</p>
<p>We have added the following to the methods to clarify why HiBit is included in the mNG-b1 construct:</p>
<p>“HiBit was included in the repair template for producing mNG-b1 cells to enable screening for edited clones using luminescence.”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Results:</p>
<p>The explanation of validation experiments in Figures 1 C and D is incomplete and difficult to follow. The rationale and explanation of the experiments could be expanded. In addition, because this is an interesting method, it would be helpful to know if the endogenous editing affects normal GPCR signaling. For example, the authors could include data showing an Isoinduced cAMP response. This is not critical to the present interpretation but is relevant as a general point regarding the method. Also, it may be relevant to the interpretation of receptor effects on G protein localization.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have expanded the rationale and explanation of experiments in Figures 1C and D by adding:</p>
<p>“For example, we observed agonist-induced BRET between the D2 dopamine receptor and mNG-b1, an interaction that requires association with endogenous Ga subunits (Figure 1C). Similarly, we observed BRET between HiBit-b1 and the free Gbg sensor memGRKct-Venus after activation of receptors that couple Gi/o, Gs, and Gq heterotrimers, indicating that HiBit-b1 associated with endogenous Ga subunits from these three families (Figure 1D).”</p>
<p>We have done the suggested cAMP experiment and provide the data in a new figure supplement:</p>
<p>“We also found that cyclic AMP accumulation in response to stimulation of endogenous b adrenergic receptors was similar in edited cell lines and their unedited parent lines (Figure 1 - figure supplement 1).”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Discussion:</p>
<p>The conclusion that beta-gamma subunits do not redistribute after GPCR activation seems new and different from previous reports. Is this correct? Can the authors elaborate on how the results compare to previous literature?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Many previous studies have indeed shown that <italic>free</italic> Gbg dimers can redistribute after GPCR activation and sample intracellular membranes. Our initial focus was on possible changes in heterotrimer distribution after GPCR activation, but in retrospect we should have directly addressed free Gbg translocation and made the distinction clear.</p>
<p>In the revised manuscript we show that <italic>during</italic> stimulation we observe changes consistent with modest translocation of endogenous Gbg from the plasma membrane and sampling of intracellular compartments. To our knowledge this is the first demonstration of endogenous Gbg translocation.</p>
<p>We have added:</p>
<p>“With overexpressed G proteins free Gbg dimers translocate from the plasma membrane and sample intracellular membrane compartments after activation-induced dissociation from Ga subunits. Consistent with this, we observed small decreases in bystander BRET at the plasma membrane and small increases in bystander BRET at intracellular compartments during activation of GPCRs, suggesting that endogenous Gbg subunits undergo similar translocation (Figure 5- figure supplement 1). Notably, these changes occurred at room temperature, suggesting that endocytosis was not involved, and developed over the course of minutes. The latter observation and the small magnitude of agonist-induced changes are both consistent with expression of primarily slowly-translocating endogenous Gg subtypes in HEK 293 cells. Moreover, as shown previously for overexpressed Gbg, the changes we observed with endogenous Gbg were readily reversible (Figure 5- figure supplement 1), suggesting that most heterotrimers reassemble at the plasma membrane after activation ceases.”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Can the authors note that OpenCell has endogenously tagged Gβ1 and reports more obvious internal localization? Can the authors comment on this point?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>OpenCell has tagged GNB1 and the Leonetti group kindly provided a parent cell line we used to add a slightly different tag. Although their study did not identify any specific intracellular compartments, our impression is that most of the internal structures visible in their images are likely to be lysosomes, as they are large, round and often have a clear lumen. Overall their images and ours are comfortingly similar. We have added:</p>
<p>“Unsurprisingly, our images are quite similar to those made as part of previous study that labeled Gb1 subunits with mNG2 (Cho et al., 2022).”</p>
<p>Notably, the Leonetti group has recently reported the subcellular distribution of many untagged proteins using a proteomic approach. They find that Gb1 is enriched on the plasma membrane and lysosomes but is not enriched on endosomes, the Golgi apparatus, endoplasmic reticulum or mitochondria <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.12.18.572249v1">(</ext-link><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.12.18.572249v1">https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.12.18.572249v1</ext-link><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.12.18.572249v1">)</ext-link>.

<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Is this the first use of CRISPR / HiBit for BRET assay? It would be helpful to know this or cite previous work if not. Also, as this is submitted as a tools piece, the authors might say a little more about the potential application to other questions.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The only previous study we are aware of utilizing a similar combination of methods is a 2020 report from the group of Dr. Stephen Hill, in which the authors studied binding of fluorescent ligands to HiBit-tagged GPCRs. This work is now cited.</p>
<p>We have also added the following to our previous brief statement about potential applications:</p>
<p>“In addition, it may also be possible to use these cells in combination with targeted sensors to study endogenous G protein activation in different subcellular compartments. More broadly, our results show that subcellular localization of endogenous membrane proteins can be studied in living cells by adding a HiBit tag and performing bystander BRET mapping. Applied at large scale this approach would have some advantages over fluorescent protein complementation, most notably the ability to localize endogenous membrane proteins that are expressed at levels that are too low to permit fluorescence microscopy.”</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This article addresses an important and interesting question concerning intracellular localization and dynamics of endogenous G proteins.

Data presented in this manuscript shows that while G proteins are mostly present on the plasma membrane, they can be also detected in endosomal compartments, especially in late endosomes and lysosomes. This distribution, according to data presented in this study, seems not to be affected by receptor activation. These findings will have implications in further studies addressing GPCR signaling mechanisms from intracellular compartments.</p>

<p>The methods used in this study are adequate for the question asked. Especially, the use of genome-edited cells (for the addition of the tag on one of the G proteins) is a great choice to prevent the effects of overexpression. Moreover, the use of bystander BRET allowed authors to probe the intracellular localization of G proteins in a very high-throughput fashion. By combining imaging and BRET authors convincingly show that G proteins are very low abundant on early endosomes (also ER, mitochondria, and medial Golgi), however seem to accumulate on membranes of late endosomal compartments.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>While the authors provide a novel dataset, many questions regarding G protein trafficking remain open. For example, it is not entirely clear which pathway is utilized to traffic G proteins from the plasma membrane to intracellular compartments. Additionally, future studies should also address the dynamics of G protein trafficking, for example by tracking them over multiple time points.</p>

<p>We agree, there is much more to do.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>This article addresses an important and interesting question concerning intracellular localization and dynamics of endogenous G proteins. While the posed question is indeed a grand one and the methods used by the authors are novel, I believe that the data presented in this manuscript are still insufficient to support all claims posed by the authors. Below I list my major concerns:</p>
<p>(1) The authors claim that they provide a &quot;detailed subcellular map of endogenous G protein distribution&quot;, however, the map is in my opinion not sufficiently detailed (e.g. trans-Golgi network is not included) and not quantitative enough (e.g. % of proteins present on one compartment vs. the other as authors claim that BRET signals &quot;cannot be directly compared between different compartments&quot;). To strengthen this statement, except for providing more extensive and quantitative data, it would be beneficial to provide such a &quot;map&quot; as an illustration based on the findings presented in this article.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>“Detailed” is certainly a subjective term. While we maintain that our description of endogenous G protein distribution is far more detailed than any previous study, we now simply claim to provide a “subcellular map”. We have added images of TGNP (TGN46; TGOLN2), showing that endogenous G proteins are readily detectable on the structures labeled by this marker. These data are now provided in Figure 3 – figure supplement 7.</p>
<p>We did not claim that our study was quantitative- we did not try to count G proteins. However, if we use published estimates of total G proteins and surface area for HEK 293 cells we estimate that there are roughly 2,500 G proteins µm-2 on the plasma membrane and 500 G proteins µm-2 on endocytic vesicles. For other intracellular compartments relative density can be approximated by inspecting images, but a truly quantitative estimate would require a surface area standard analogous to FM4-64 for each compartment. The percentage of the total G protein pool on a given compartment is, in our opinion, less important than the density of G proteins on that compartment, as the latter is more likely to affect the efficiency of local signal transduction. Since we do not claim to have accurate G protein density estimates for many intracellular compartments, we prefer to provide several raw images for each compartment rather than a schematized map.</p>
<p>Bystander BRET values cannot be compared directly across compartments due to differences in expression and energy transfer efficiency of different markers and compartment surface area. This method is well suited for following changes in distribution as a function of time or after perturbations and for sensitive detection of weak colocalization but can only provide approximate “maps” of absolute distribution.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) Probing of the intracellular distribution of these proteins, especially after GPCR activation, includes a single chosen timepoint. I believe that the manuscript would greatly benefit from including some dynamic data on internalization and intracellular trafficking kinetics. What is the turnover of tested G proteins? What is the fraction that is going to recycling compartments and/or lysosomes? Authors could perhaps turn to other methods to be able to dynamically track proteins over time e.g. via photoconversion techniques.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Because G protein trafficking appears to be largely constitutive there is no easy way for us to assess how long it takes G proteins to transit various intracellular compartments, although we agree this would be interesting. As the reviewer suggests, dynamic data on constitutive trafficking would require methods (such as photoconversion) not currently available to us for endogenous G proteins. Accordingly, we have made no claims regarding the kinetics of G protein trafficking. As for possible redistribution after GPCR activation, in the revised manuscript we have added 5- and 15-minute timepoints after agonist stimulation for our bystander BRET mapping (Figure 5- figure supplement 2). These timepoints were chosen to correspond to persistent signaling mediated by internalized receptors.</p>

<p>(3) Exemplary images with cells showing significant colocalization with lysosomal compartments seem to contain more intracellular vesicles visible in the mNG channel than in the case of the other compartment. Is it an effect of the treatment to stain lysosomes? It would be beneficial to compare it with some endogenous marker e.g. LAMP1 without additional treatments.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The visibility of intracellular vesicles in our lysosome images likely reflects our selection of cells and regions with visible and abundant lysosomes, specifically peripheral regions directly adhered to the coverslip, rather than treatment with lysosomal stains (LV 633 and dextran). As suggested, we now include images of cells expressing LAMP1 as an alternative lysosome marker (Figure 3 - figure supplement 6).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) The authors probe an abundance of G proteins along the constitutive endocytic pathway. However, to prove that G proteins are not de-palmitoylated rather than endocytosed authors should perform control experiments where endocytosis is blocked e.g. pharmacologically or via a knockdown approach. Additionally, various endocytic pathways can be probed.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We did not claim that depalmitoylation plays no role in delivery of G proteins to internal compartments. In fact, we pointed out that we cannot at present rule out other pathways and delivery mechanisms. Importantly, if some of the G proteins that we detect along the endocytic pathway do arrive there by trafficking through the cytosol this would only strengthen our major conclusion that endocytosis is inefficient.</p>
<p>Having said this, we have now conducted extensive experiments investigating the role of palmitate cycling in the trafficking of heterotrimeric G proteins and the small G protein H-Ras. Our results suggest that a depalmitoylation-repalmitoylation cycle is not important for the distribution of heterotrimers, but these findings will be the subject of a separate publication focused on this specific question for both large and small G proteins.</p>
<p>We agree that it will be interesting to probe different endocytic pathways, as suggested using a genetic approach. Our main interest here was in endocytic membranes that were defined functionally (with FM4-64 or internalized receptors) rather than biochemically.</p>
