<title>Abstract</title>
<p>We have previously shown that after few seconds of adaptation by finger-tapping, the perceived numerosity of spatial arrays and temporal sequences of visual objects displayed near the tapping region is increased or decreased, implying the existence of a <italic>sensorimotor numerosity system</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Anobile et al., 2016</xref>). To date, this mechanism has been evidenced only by adaptation. Here we extend our finding by leveraging on a well-established covariance technique, used to unveil and characterize “channels” for basic visual features such as colour, motion, contrast, and spatial frequency. Participants were required to press rapidly a key a specific number of times, without counting. We then correlated the precision of reproduction for various target number presses between participants. The results showed high positive correlations for nearby target numbers, scaling down with numerical distance, implying tuning selectivity. Factor analysis identified two factors, one for low and the other for higher numbers. Principal component analysis revealed two bell-shaped covariance channels, peaking at different numerical values. Two control experiments ruled out the role of non-numerical strategies based on tapping frequency and response duration. These results reinforce our previous reports based on adaptation, and further suggest the existence of at least two sensorimotor number channels responsible for translating symbolic numbers into action sequences.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Humans share with many animals a primitive non-verbal number system encoding the number of objects in space and events in time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Dehaene, 2011</xref>). The capacity to estimate number rapidly but imperfectly is thought to be a primary perceptual attribute, often termed the <italic>number sense</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Burr &amp; Ross, 2008</xref>). The past few decades have accumulated much evidence for the existence of the number sense. Many studies show that the sense of number is truly general, transcending space and time, as well as modality and format (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Arrighi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Burr et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Togoli et al., 2021</xref>). More recently, numerosity has been shown to interact strongly with action, leading to the idea of a <italic>sensorimotor number system</italic>, incorporating action, and its interaction with sensory systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Anobile et al., 2016</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">2021</xref>).</p>
<p>Both physiological and psychophysical studies support the existence of a sensorimotor number system. Adaptation studies provide strong evidence: participants first tap continuously with their index finger for a few seconds, either rapidly or slowly, then estimate the numerosity of a dot array presented near the adapted region: adaptation to fast tapping causes underestimation and slow tapping overestimation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Anobile et al., 2016</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Maldonado Moscoso et al., 2020</xref>). Motor adaptation induces similar effects on sequential visual and auditory stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Anobile et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Togoli et al., 2020</xref>), consistent with the existence of a generalized system linking motor and sensory signals to encode numerosity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Anobile et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Burr et al., 2021</xref>).</p>
<p>Electrophysiological studies in primates also point to the existence of a specific neural substrate for counting a small set of actions. In a seminal paper Sawamura at al. (2002) trained monkeys to repetitively make five identical movements, then switch to a different movement, in a cyclical fashion: neurons in the posterior parietal cortex showed selectivity to the number of self-generated actions, whatever the action. Kirshhock and Nieder (2022) trained crows to peck a specific number of times (1 to 5). Neurons in the telencephalon were shown to be tuned to the impending number of self-generated actions, during the phase between the disappearance of the target to the onset of motor reproduction. The activity of these neurons predicted the behavioural performance and was independent of both stimulus format (dots or digits) and of the temporal characteristics of the motor responses. Each tuning function peaked at a given preferred numerosity, with activity scaling down with numerical distance. Overall, these cells in the crow brain could constitute the neural substrate subserving the transformation of sensory inputs into a given quantity of numerical actions, possibly a similar mechanism to that driving the motor number adaptation effects in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Anobile et al., 2016</xref>).</p>
<p>Although motor adaptation has revealed a clear link between action and numerosity perception, this is the only technique used so far to investigate the interaction in humans. The aim of the current study is therefore to expand and generalize our previous findings, using a different psychophysical technique that exploits individual differences in reproduction precision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Peterzell &amp; Kennedy, 2016</xref>). This technique has been widely used to reveal visual channels for motion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Morrone et al., 1999</xref>), spatial frequency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Reynaud &amp; Hess, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Simpson &amp; McFadden, 2005</xref>), contrast sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Peterzell et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Peterzell &amp; Teller, 1996</xref>), color (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Peterzell et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Peterzell &amp; Teller, 2000</xref>) and duration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Rammsayer &amp; Troche, 2014</xref>).</p>
<p>The rationale behind this technique is that performance measures of stimuli detected by the same mechanism should correlate more between individuals than stimuli detected by different mechanisms. <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref> illustrates the technique by simulation of results in a numerosity reproduction task if the task were mediated for 1, 2 or 4 numerosity-selective channels. It assumes intrinsic variability in reproduction precision across participants, perturbed by additive random noise. The top row simulates results if reproduction of all numerosities were governed by a single mechanism, rather than a range of numerosity-tuned mechanisms. The correlation matrix for all pairs of stimuli (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>) shows no systematic pattern, only random variations in correlations due to the general noisiness of the channel. <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref> plots the average correlation plotted as a function of numerosity ratio, showing no dependence on number ratio. Increasing or decreasing the added noise will change the average correlation, but not create any dependency on numerosity ratio. However, if there exist mechanisms selective for numerosity, the results are quite different. Assuming just two mechanisms tuned to low and high numbers (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>) yields a correlation matrix with higher correlations between similar numbers (near the diagonal) than dissimilar numbers. This leads to the clear dependency on numerosity ratio shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>. Similarly, for a range of numerosity-selective mechanisms like the four shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G</xref>, there will be a strong dependency on numerical distance (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1I</xref>). The cases of two and four channels are difficult to distinguish if the amount of added noise is free to vary. Techniques such as cluster analysis and principal component analysis (PCA) can be also applied to study further the tuning of the channels.</p>

<p>Here we applied the interindividual covariance technique to study sensorimotor tuning in humans, using a number matching task similar to that used by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Kirschhock &amp; Nieder (2022)</xref>. We measured the precision with which 30 participants could press a key a given number of times (8-32) without counting, and then correlated performance across all pairs of numbers (like the simulation of <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). The results clearly demonstrate the existence of sensorimotor mechanisms converting symbolic numbers into actions, with correlations decreasing with numerical distance, like <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1F &amp; I</xref>.</p>

<sec id="s2a">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>An a priori power analysis for a correlation test (r) with a medium effect size of r<sup>2</sup> = 0.5, and α=0.05 (one tailed, as positive correlations are expected) and power of 0.9 indicated a required sample size of 28 participants. 30 participants took part in the fast-tapping condition (age: average= 25.75, SD=4.5, min=18, max=39) and 29 in the slow tapping condition (age: average= 25.43, SD=4.04, min=18, max=39). Of these, 18 completed both conditions. The experimental procedures were approved by the local ethics committee (<italic>Commissione per l’Etica della Ricerca</italic>, University of Florence, July 7, 2020, n. 111). The research was in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and informed consent were obtained from all participants prior to the experiment.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2b">
<title>Stimuli and procedures</title>
<p>Stimuli were generated and presented with PsychToolbox routines for Matlab (ver. R2021a). Stimuli were white visual digit numbers (8, 10, 11, 13, 14, 16, 19, 21, 24, 28, 32) presented in the centre of a grey screen (iMac Retina display 27–inch) for 1 s and subtending 5° of visual angle. Soon after the disappearance of the target digit, participants were asked to repeatedly press a key as many times the target. In separate sessions, participants were asked to tap as fast as they could or at a comfortable rate. Participants were all right-handed and performed the tapping’s with their right hand on a spacebar positioned about 30 cm to the right of the monitor, to guarantee a comfortable arm position. Following previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Cordes et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Whalen et al., 1999</xref>), serial counting was prevented by vocal suppression, repeating aloud the syllable ‘ba’ (as fast as possible). For each participant, each target number was presented from 25 to 30 times (for a total of 17183 trials: 8259 and 8924 trials in the fast and slow tapping conditions), in separate blocks (usually 5) interspaced by pauses of a few minutes. For those participants who completed both the fast and slow tapping condition, the two were measured on different days (on average within 3-4 days). Each condition took about 1.5 hours of testing (3 hours for those who completed both). Before the experiment, participants were familiarized with the task performing one single block of trials with feedback (a digit displaying the number of tappings performed). In this phase 11 trials were presented, one for each tested number (randomly selected trial by trial). No feedback was provided during the rest of the experiment.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2c">
<title>Control duration task</title>
<p>A randomly selected sub-sample of 9 participants from the slow tapping condition was engaged in a duration control task. On each trial, a tone (500 Hz, ramped on and off with 20 ms raised-cosine ramps) was played though headphones, and participants asked to reproduce its duration by repeatedly tapping on a key while pronouncing the syllable ‘ba’ as fast as possible (to suppress counting). The between average tapping frequency rate in the number task was 3.1 Hz (SD 1.1 Hz) and 3.5 Hz (SD 1.3 Hz) in the duration task (t<sub>(8)</sub>=1.03, p= 0.33). Target durations were customised for each participant to perfectly match those previously produced in the number task: for each target number tested in the number matching task, we extracted the average response duration (across trials) and these eleven durations were re-presented as duration targets (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Before the experiment, participants were familiarized with the task by performing one single block of trials with feedback (2 numbers, one displaying the target duration and the second displaying the reproduced duration, in seconds). In this phase 11 trials were presented, one for each tested duration (randomly selected trial by trial). No feedbacks were provided during the rest of the experiment. As for the number task, for each participant, each duration was presented from 25 to 30 times (for a total of 2455 trials), in separate blocks.</p>

<title>Data analyses</title>
<p>All the analyses were performed with Matlab software (ver. R2021a) with the exception of the repeated measures ANOVA comparing Weber fractions for the number and duration task and the t-test comparing frequency rates for the number and duration task (performed with JASP software, ver. 0.16.3).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2e">
<title>Data processing</title>
<p>As a first step we detected and eliminated outlier responses. For each experimental condition, and separately for each participant and stimulus intensity, responses were converted into z-scores and eliminated from the analyses if falling above or below 3 STD. In the number matching task, this procedure resulted in the elimination of 0.5% of the trials in the fast-tapping condition and 0.6% in the slow tapping condition. In the control duration task, the same procedure led to the elimination of 0.4% trials in the duration matching condition and 0.6% in the number matching condition.</p>
<p>As a second step we measured responses accuracy and precision, on non-standardized data. For each task, and separately for each participant and stimulus intensity (numbers or durations), accuracy was indexed as the mean reproduction value across trials and precision as Weber fraction, computed as responses standard deviation divided by the average reproduction.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2f">
<title>Correlation matrices and numerical distance</title>
<p>As a third step we computed correlation matrices between (non-standardized) Weber fractions using Pearson correlation coefficients and analyses the correlation strength as a function of numerical distance. This last analysis (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>, panels B&amp;D) was performed on binned data. Bins were created to have an approximately equal number of observations for each bin (13, 13, 14, 15). For each target, the numerical distance was calculated as the base ten logarithm ratio between itself and the remaining target numbers. The correlation coefficients between Weber fractions were then averaged within the following numerical distance bins (log10 ratios): &lt;0.08; 0.08-0.14; 0.14-0.21; 0.21-0.29, 0.29-0.39, &gt;0.39).</p>

</fig>
<p>As a sanity check, this analysis was also performed on randomized correlation matrices. For this analysis we applied a bootstrap approach. On each of 10000 iterations, separately for each subject, the Weber fractions were randomized between numerosities and a new correlation matrix computed. Then (as before) the correlation coefficients were averaged within the reported bins. The results of this analysis are reported in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref> (panels B&amp;D) as the “random” curve.</p>

<title>Hierarchical clustering and Principal component analysis</title>
<p>The hierarchical clustering was performed on normalised (z-scores) Weber fractions using the linkage method. The distances were calculated with the Euclidean metric and the “ward” algorithm was used to compute the distance between clusters. The number of clusters was determined by the inconsistency index (computed by the build in <italic>inconsistent</italic> function in Matlab 2021a) and results reported as a dendrogram. As for the PCA, to check the validity of this analysis, we tested it with randomized correlation matrices, with a bootstrap approach. On each of 10,000 iterations, separately for each participant, the Weber fractions were randomized between numerosities, and a new clustering was computed. Then at each iteration we looked at the structure of the clusters, counting the time on which the clusters (separately for the fast and slow tapping conditions) contained contiguous numbers (as in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4 A&amp;B</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>The principal component analysis was performed on normalised (z-scores) and centred Weber fractions and factors rotated with the non-orthogonal promax method (but orthogonal varimax provides similar results). The number of components was determined as those exceeding an eigenvalue of 1 and from visual inspection of the scree plots.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2h">
<title>Modelling</title>
<p>As a preliminary analysis, we modelled the behaviour of a system with 1, 2 or 4 channels, assuming that each channel would process stimuli with a gaussian tuning (like the illustration of <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). The 1-channel model had infinitely broad tuning, and the tuning of the 2- and 4-channel models was allowed to vary between 0.5 and 2 octaves. The peak of the tuning was equally spaced in log coordinates to be 8 and 32 for the 2-channel model and 8, 12.7, 20.1 and 32 for the 4-channel model. The behaviour for numerosities handled by more than one channel was determined by a weighted average of the various channels. The average WF of the channels taken from the actual dataset (i.e. 0.176 for the slow and fast tapping) however the specific values for each observers could vary following a gaussian distribution whose standard deviation was varied to achieve best fit. We then calculated predicted correlations simulating 25 repetitions for each numerosity and observer. Without any noise correlations between the same channel would approximate 1. Hence to achieve reasonable levels of correlation we assumed that the actual measured WF was corrupted by some noise which we manipulated to mimic the average correlation between observed in the actual experiment. Correlation matrices were obtained by simulating 1000 experiments with cohorts of 29-30 observers to yield the best fit (R<sup>2</sup>).</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Participants pressed a key a specific number of times (visually displayed as a digit) while repeatedly pronouncing the syllable ‘ba’ as fast as possible, to prevent counting. To gauge the generalizability across different motor actions, in separate sessions, participants were required to tap concurrently as fast as they could (fast tapping) or at a comfortable rate (slow tapping).</p>
<p>As expected, the rate of tapping was higher in the fast tapping (average= 6.8 Hz, SD = 1) compared with the slow tapping condition (average = 3.3 Hz, SD = 1.6). In both conditions participants were able to correctly perform the numerical matching task, with average number of reproduced actions scaling linearly with visual targets (both r = 0.99, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2 B</xref> shows precision (Weber fractions, Wfs) in matching target and reproduced numerosity as a function of target number. Average Wfs (across target number) in the fast and slow conditions were virtually identical (average= 0.17, SD= 0.01 and average= 0.17, SD= 0.007 for fast and slow tapping respectively) and within each condition, Wfs were roughly constant across targets, following Weber’s Law.</p>
<p>We then computed the correlations between Wfs between participants, for all targets values. <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3 A&amp;C</xref> show correlation matrices across all participants (like the simulations of <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>), with each cell representing the Pearson correlation coefficient between the two target numbers. The correlations were all positive, ranging from 0.1 to 0.75 in the fast condition and 0.3 to 0.88 in the slow condition. Importantly, the correlations were clearly not randomly distributed, but most of the higher correlations (reddish) lie near the diagonal, indicating that the motor matching performance was more similar for neighbouring numbers, compared to higher numerical distance.</p>
<p><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3 B&amp;D</xref> show average correlation coefficients between participants, averaged into six bins as a function of numerical distance. There is a systematic decreasing trend in both fast and slow tapping conditions (linear fit on unbinned data shown by dashed lines in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3 B&amp;D</xref>: slopes= –0.58 ±0.11, –0.57 ±0.07 for fast and slow respectively, both p&lt;0.001), clearly different to that predicted by a random pattern of matching precision levels (curves with filled symbols in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3 B&amp;D</xref>, see methods). Overall, these analyses confirm that the degree of performance similarity was systematically modulated by the numerical difference between targets, in line with the existence of underlying tuning functions.</p>
<p>As a preliminary analysis we modelled the data with simulations like that of <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>, assuming one, two or four numerosity-selective channels. The average WFs for the participants was taken from the data, and channel width, variability, and measurement noise free parameters. The fits with a single channel were very poor, with R<sup>2</sup> = 0.003 and 0.002 (essentially no better than the mean) for the fast and slow tapping respectively. However, the two-channel model gave much better fits, with R<sup>2</sup> = 0.54 and 0.29. The four-channel model had similarly good fits, with R<sup>2</sup> = 0.52 and 0.28. The parameters to yield best fits seemed reasonable, with channel width of 1.2 and 1.8 octaves, and channel variability between 0.051 and 0.106.</p>
<p>We then investigated the structure underlying the number sensorimotor translation system with a hierarchical clustering analysis (see methods for details). <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4 (A&amp;C)</xref> shows the resulting dendrograms. In both the fast and slow tapping conditions, the analyses returned a two-cluster solution with one cluster aggregating low numbers (N8-13 and N8-14 in the fast and slow conditions) and the other aggregating high numbers (N&gt;13 and N&gt;14 respectively). This analysis corroborates the results obtained from the correlation analysis and add on this suggests the existence (at least) of two channels dealing with relatively different numerical targets. A control analysis on randomised data (see methods) yielded clusters containing contiguous numbers only in 0.005% of cases (for both the fast and slow tapping conditions), suggesting that the results with the original dataset likely represent a structure genuinely organised as a function of the highest similarity between neighbouring numbers.</p>
<p>To study the tuning of these two hypothetical channels, we then performed a factor analysis on Wfs. In both fast and slow tapping conditions, two factors emerged (see methods), explaining a total of 68% and 81% of the total variance (for the fast and slow tapping conditions respectively). <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref> shows the rotated component strength as a function of target number. The results revealed two bell-shaped tuning functions for both fast (panel B) and slow (panel D) tapping conditions, with factor strength distributions reasonably described by logGaussian functions (fast tapping: R<sup>2</sup> = 0.6 and R<sup>2</sup> = 0.65; slow tapping: R<sup>2</sup> = 0.97, R<sup>2</sup> = 0.94 for 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> components). In the fast-tapping condition, the first component peaked at lower target numbers (N 11) and the second component at higher numbers (N 29). In the slow motor condition, the first component packed at higher target numbers (N 26) and the second component at lower numbers (N 8).</p>
<p>That fast and slow tapping conditions provided similar results despite the very different tapping rates suggests that temporal frequency of the tapping did not play a major role. However, as total response duration was positively correlated with target numbers (r = 0.95, r = 0.36, for fast and slow tapping, both p&lt;0.001), participants might have used response duration instead of number of taps as a stop criterion. To test this possibility, a sub-sample of 9 participants were given a control task to match the duration of a tone (see methods). If the number task was performed through duration, this latter must have an equal or lower precision level compared to that measured in the number task. <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5 A&amp;B</xref> shows that this was not the case with the precision level (Wfs) in the number task being clearly lower (higher precision) than the duration task, making the use of duration strategies during the number task unlikely (number: average=0.16, SD= 0.03; duration: average= 0.24, SD= 0.04). A RM ANOVA with task (duration, number) and stimuli intensity (11 levels) confirmed the difference (F(1, 80)= 19.97, p= 0.002).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Using a motor reproduction task, we measured the precision with which number digits were translated into sequences of actions. Replicating previous evidence from both human and animal studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Cordes et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Kirschhock &amp; Nieder, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Whalen et al., 1999</xref>), precision followed Weber’s law, a well-established signature of the Approximate Number System (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Anobile et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Dehaene, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Feigenson et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Ross, 2003</xref>). More importantly, by looking at the covariance structure of the precision index (Weber fraction) between participants, we found evidence for sensorimotor channels tuned to number. Precision for reproducing numerically similar targets was positively correlated (r∼0.8) but for larger numerical distances, correlations decreased (r∼0.1), suggesting the action of sensori-motor channels sharing the encoding of neighbouring numbers. In line with this, cluster analyses identified two main clusters, one aggregating low numbers (from 8 to ∼13) and the other higher numbers (from ∼13 to 32), pointing to (at least) two mechanisms encoding low and higher numbers. Finally, Principal Component Analyses on Weber fractions confirmed this and went to describe two bell-shaped components, one peaking at relatively low numbers (∼10) and the second at higher numbers (∼27).</p>
<p>The covariance technique used here has been widely employed to reveal visual channels in several basic perceptual dimensions such as colour, motion, contrast and spatial frequency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Morrone et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Peterzell et al., 1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Peterzell &amp; Kennedy, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Peterzell &amp; Teller, 1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Rammsayer &amp; Troche, 2014</xref>). The technique is based on the idea that interindividual variability conveys information that can reveal common sensory processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Peterzell &amp; Kennedy, 2016</xref>), as illustrated in Figure 0. In practice, this approach requires multiple and densely sampled measurements of different stimuli intensity, in the same sample. Regions of high intercorrelation between neighbouring stimuli intensity can be interpreted to imply that sets of stimuli are processed by the same (shared) underlying channel. This channel, while responding relatively more to its preferred stimulus, will also be activated by neighbouring stimuli that although slightly different from the preferred intensity, are nevertheless included in the same response distribution. Following this rationale, relatively lower correlations among more distant stimuli would indicate that these are processed by different, or at least partially independent, channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Peterzell &amp; Teller, 1996</xref>). The results obtained in this study are in line with those predicted by this technique, implying the existence of sensorimotor channels tuned to different numerical targets, with a rather wide response distribution.</p>
<p>The results reinforce adaptation studies showing number-selective adaptation between actions and perceived numerosity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Anobile et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Maldonado Moscoso et al., 2020</xref>). Those studies provided strong evidence for the existence of at least two (but possibly more) sensorimotor mechanisms, tuned to high and low numbers. The results are also broadly in line with recent evidence from animal physiology showing number selective sensorimotor neurons in the crow brain, translating visual inputs (digits and dot arrays) into number of pecks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Kirschhock &amp; Nieder, 2022</xref>). While the crow study found as many channels as the number tested (N1–5), we found evidence for only two channels (clusters and factors) over the range of 8–32. However, it is important to note that PCA aims to summarize the dataset with the minimal number of components (channels). We can therefore not exclude the possible existence of more than two (perhaps not fully independent) channels. The results should be not interpreted as evidence for only two sensorimotor channels, but rather as evidence that tuned mechanisms exist in the human brain, with at least two different tunings.</p>
<p>This is also apparent from the simulations of <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>, showing that the predictions of two or multiple channels are very similar, difficult to distinguish with the current technique. Indeed, the fits to the data using two or four channels were very similar, but both almost infinitely better than the one-channel fit.</p>
<p>The results reported here are unlikely to be contaminated by strategies capitalizing on duration of motor responses and/or temporal frequency. Despite the very different tapping rates in the slow (∼3 Hz) and fast motor conditions (∼7 Hz), the overall pattern of results remained almost unchanged. The only difference was an inversion of the order of the principal components and factors, with the first component peaking at lower numbers for the fast-tapping condition and higher numbers for the slow tapping condition (and vice versa for the second component). This result suggests that for fast actions lower number targets show more variance than higher numbers, and vice versa for slower actions. Although we have no definitive explanation for this pattern of results, it could arise from different effects of the matching motor noise associated with different tapping rates across the number ranges. In any event, the results showed two covariance channels for both conditions, similarly distributed along the numerical targets, supporting the existence of at least two mechanisms, one tuned to the lower numbers and one to the higher (at least within this numerical range).</p>
<p>Even if total duration of responses were positively correlated with target number, and although participants were free to use duration as a viable stopping criterion, the exploitation of this non-numerical strategy seems unlikely. In the control task, where participants reproduced duration rather than number, clearly showed lower precision levels, making it unlikely to account for the precision measured on motor numerosity reproduction. Once again, these results are in line with previous studies showing lower sensitivities for motor matching duration tasks compared with motor number matching tasks. The electrophysiological study on crows also found similar neural response curves across very different motor response timing conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Kirschhock &amp; Nieder, 2022</xref>). In summary, the results seem to suggest that the channels found here, like those in crows, reflect a genuine number selective sensorimotor transformation processes.</p>
<p>What may be the adaptive value of this mechanism? The spontaneous use of the number of actions in the animal kingdom is now well-established. For example, desert ants rely on the number of steps to return to the nest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Wittlinger et al., 2006</xref>), some species of male frogs match or exceed the chucks of competitors to attract female partner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Rose, 2017</xref>), and some songbirds modulate the numbers of syllables in their calls to signal dangerousness of predators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Suzuki, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Templeton et al., 2005</xref>). In all cases, the use of number-related motor strategies by animals has a clear ecological value for survival and species preservation.</p>
<p>This system may have been preserved in humans and repurposed for our species-specific needs. Some hints come from the literature on the role of visual numerosity perception (dot arrays). Although most animal species are capable of some form of numerosity estimation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Butterworth, 2022</xref>), it appears that in humans numerosity estimation may act as a non-symbolic precursor for the development of symbolic mathematical skills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Chen &amp; Li, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Decarli et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Halberda et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Mazzocco et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Piazza, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Piazza et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Schneider et al., 2017</xref>). The sensorimotor system could act as an early tool to constantly update and calibrate motor and sensory systems for the encoding and active manipulation of quantities and objects, with a potential impact on the quality of formal mathematical skills in later development. In line with this idea, there are reports of a possible co-occurrence of motor impairments in children with mathematical learning disorders such as dyscalculia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Westendorp et al., 2011</xref>), and children with developmental coordination disorders (which impair gross and fine motor function) perform poorly on math and numerosity tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Gomez et al., 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">2017</xref>). This is in line with the suggestive idea proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Walsh (2003)</xref> of a sensory magnitude system, encoding abstract quantities such as space, time and number, to guide planning and execution of actions. It is also in line with more recent proposal suggesting that the acquisition of number meaning is deeply grounded in sensorimotor experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Ranzini et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Sixtus et al., 2023</xref>).</p>

<p>The paper addresses the <bold>important</bold> question of how numerical information is represented in the human brain. Experimental findings are interpreted as providing evidence for a sensorimotor mechanism that involves channels, each tuned to a particular numerical range. However, the logic of the channel concept as employed here, as well as the claims regarding a sensorimotor basis for these channels, is <bold>incomplete</bold> and thus requires clarification and/or modification.</p>

<p>Anobile and colleagues present a manuscript detailing an account of numerosity processing with an appeal to a two-channel model. Specifically, the authors propose that the perception of numerosity relies on (at least) two distinct channels for small and large numerosities, which should be evident in subject reports of perceived numerosity. To do this, the authors had subjects reproduce visual dot arrays of numerosities ranging from 8 to 32 dots, by having subjects repetitively press a response key at a pre-instructed rate (fast or slow) until the number of presses equaled the number of perceived dots. The subjects performed the task remarkably well, yet with a general bias to overestimate the number of presented dots. Further, no difference was observed in the precision of responses across numerosities, providing evidence for a scalar system. No differences between fast and slow tapping were observed. For behavioral analysis, the authors examined correlations between the Weber fractions for all presented numerosities. Here, it was found that the precision at each numerosity was similar to that at neighboring numerosities, but less similar to more distant ones. The authors then went on to conduct PCA and clustering analyses on the weber fractions, finding that the first two components exhibited an interaction with the presented numerosity, such that each was dominant at distinct lower and upper ranges and further well-fit by a log-Gaussian model consistent with the channel explanation proposed at the beginning.</p>
<p>Overall, the authors provide compelling evidence for a two-channel system supporting numerosity processing that is instantiated in sensorimotor processes. A strength of the presented work is the principled approach the authors took to identify mechanisms, as well as the controls put in place to ensure adequate data for analysis. Some questions do remain in the data, and there are aspects of the presentation that could be adjusted.</p>
<p>-The use of a binary colormap for the correlation matrix seems unnecessary. Binary colormaps between two opposing colors (with white in the middle) are best for results spanning positive and negative values (say, correlation values between -1 and +1), but the correlations here are all positive, so a uniform colormap should be applied. I can appreciate that the authors were trying to emphasize that a 2+ channel system would lead to lower correlations at larger ratios, but that's emphasized better in the numerical ratio line plots.</p>
<p>-In Figure 1, the correlation matrices in Figure 1 appear blurred out. I am not sure if this was intentional but suspect it was not, and so they should appear like those presented in Figure 3.</p>
<p>-It's notable that the authors also collected data on a timing task to rule out a duration-based strategy in the numerosity task. If possible, it would be great to have the author also conduct the rest of the analyses on the duration task as well; that is, to look at WF correlation matrices/ratios as well as PCA. There is evidence that duration processing is also distinctly sensorimotor, and may also rely on similar channels. Evidence either for or against this would likely be of great interest.</p>
<p>-For the duration task, there was no fast tapping condition. Why not? Was this to keep the overall task length short?</p>
<p>-The number of subjects/trials seems a bit odd. Why did some subjects perform both and not others? The targets say they were presented &quot;between 25 and 30 times&quot;, but why was this variable at all?</p>
<p>-For the PCA analysis, my read of the methods and results is that this was done on all the data, across subjects. If the data were run on individual subjects and the resulting PCA components averaged, would the same results be found?</p>
<p>-For the data presented in Figure 2, it would be helpful to also see individual subject data underlaid on the plots to get a sense of individual differences. For the reproduced number, these will likely be clustered together given how small the error bars are, but for the WF data it may show how consistently &quot;flat&quot; the data are. Indeed, in other magnitude reproduction tasks, it is not uncommon to see the WF decrease as a function of target magnitude (or even increase). It may be possible that the reason for the observed findings is that some subjects get more variable (higher WFs) with larger target numbers and others get less variable (lower WFs).</p>
<p>-Regarding the two-channel model, I wonder how much the results would translate to different ranges of numerosities? For example, are the two channels supported here specific to these ranges of low and high numbers, or would there be a re-mapping to a higher range (say, 32 to 64 dots) or to a narrower range (say 16 to 32 dots). It would be helpful to know if there is any evidence for this kind of remapping.</p>

<p>The authors wish to apply established psychophysical methods to the study of number. Specifically, they wish to test the hypothesis - supported by their previous work - that human sensorimotor processes are tuned to specific number ranges. In a novel set of tasks, they ask participants to tap a button N times (either fast or slow), where N varies between 8 and 32 across trials. As I understood it, they then computed the Weber fraction (WF) for each participant for each number and correlated those values across participants and numbers. They find stronger correlations for nearby numbers than for distant numbers and interpret this as evidence of sensorimotor tuning functions. Two other analyses - cluster analyses and principal component analyses (PCA) - suggest that participants' performance relied on at least 2 mechanisms, one for encoding low numbers of taps (around 10) and another for encoding larger numbers (around 27).</p>
<p>Strengths</p>
<p>Individual differences can be a rich source of scientific insight and I applaud the authors for taking them seriously, and for exploring new avenues in the study of numerical cognition.</p>
<p>Weaknesses</p>
<p>Inter-subject-correlation</p>
<p>
The experiment &quot;is based on the idea that interindividual variability conveys information that can reveal common sensory processes (Peterzell &amp; Kennedy, 2016)&quot; but I struggled to understand the logic of this technique. The authors explain it most clearly when they write &quot;Regions of high intercorrelation between neighbouring stimuli intensity can be interpreted to imply that sets of stimuli are processed by the same (shared) underlying channel. This channel, while responding relatively more to its preferred stimulus, will also be activated by neighbouring stimuli that although slightly different from the preferred intensity, are nevertheless included in the same response distribution.&quot; As I understood it, the correlations are performed &quot;between participants, for all targets values&quot; - meaning that they are measuring the extent to which different participants' WFs vary together. But why is this a good measure of channels? This analysis seems to assume that if people have channels for numerical estimation, they will have the same channels, tuned to the same numerical ranges. But this is an empirical question - individual participants could have wildly different channels, and perhaps different numbers of channels (even in the tested range). If they do, then this between-subject analysis would mask these individual differences (despite the subtitle).</p>
<p>Different channels</p>
<p>
I had trouble understanding much of the analyses, and this may account for at least some of my confusion. That said, as I understand it, the results are meant to provide &quot;evidence that tuned mechanisms exist in the human brain, with at least two different tunings&quot; because of the results of the clustering analysis and PCA. However, as the authors acknowledge, &quot;PCA aims to summarize the dataset with the minimal number of components (channels). We can therefore not exclude the possible existence of more than two (perhaps not fully independent) channels.&quot; So I believe this technique does not provide more evidence for the existence of 2 channels as for the existence of 4 or 8 or 11 channels, the upper bound for a task testing 11 different numbers. If we can conclude that people may have one channel per number, what does &quot;channel&quot; mean?</p>
<p>Several other questions arose for me when thinking through this technique. If people did have two channels (at least in this range), why would they be so broad? Why would they be centered so near the ends of the tested range? Can such effects be explained by binning on the part of the participants, who might have categorized each number (knowingly or not) as either &quot;small&quot; or &quot;large&quot;? Whereas the experiment tested numbers 8-32, numbers are infinite - How could a small number of channels cover an infinite set? Or even the set 8-10,000? More broadly, I was unsure what advantages channels would have - that is - how in principle would having distinct channels for processing similar stimuli improve (rather than impede) discrimination abilities?</p>
<p>No number perception</p>
<p>
I was uncertain about the analogy to studies of other continuous dimensions like spatial frequency, motion, and color. In those studies, participants view images with different spatial frequency, motion, or color - the analogy would be to see dot arrays containing different numbers of dots. Instead, here participants read written numerals (like &quot;19&quot;), symbols which themselves do not have any numerical properties to perceive. How does that difference change the interpretation of the effects? One disadvantage of using numerals is that they introduce a clear discontinuity: Our base-10 numerical system artificially chunks integers into decades, potentially causing category-boundary effects in people's reproductions.</p>
<p>Sensorimotor</p>
<p>
The authors wished to test for &quot;sensorimotor mechanisms selective to numerosity&quot; but it's not clear what makes their effects sensorimotor (or selective to numerosity, see below). It's true they found effects using a tapping task (which like all behavior is sensorimotor), but it's not clear that this effect is specific to sensorimotor number reproduction. They might find similar effects for numerical comparison or estimation tasks. Such findings would suggest the effect may be a general feature of numerical cognition across modalities.</p>
<p>Specific to numbers</p>
<p>
The authors argue that their effects are &quot;number selective&quot; but they do not provide compelling evidence for this selectivity. In principle, their main findings could be explained by the duration of tapping rather than the number of taps. They argue this is unlikely for two reasons. The first reason is that the overall pattern of results was unchanged across the fast and slow tapping conditions, but differences in duration were confounded with numerosity in both conditions, so the comparison is uninformative. (Given this, I am not sure what we stand to learn by comparing the two tapping speeds.) The second reason is that temporal reproduction was less precise in their control condition than numerical reproduction, but this logic is unclear: Participants could still use duration (or some combination of speed and duration) as a helpful cue to numerosity, even if their duration reproductions were imperfect.</p>
<p>If the authors wish to test the role of duration, they might consider applying the same analytical techniques they use for numbers to their duration data. Perhaps participants show similar evidence for duration-selective channels, in the absence of number, as they do for other non-numerical domains (like spatial frequency).</p>
<p>Theories of numerical cognition. An expansive literature on numerical cognition suggests that many animals, human children, and adults across cultures have two systems for representing numerosity without counting - one that can represent the exact cardinality of sets smaller than about 4 and another that represents the approximate number of larger sets (but see Cheyette &amp; Piantadosi, 2020). The current paper would benefit from better relating its findings to this long lineage of theories and findings in numerical approximation across cultures, ages, and species.</p>
