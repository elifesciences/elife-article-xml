<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Dynamics is a crucial link between sequence and function for intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs). NMR spin relaxation is a powerful technique for characterizing the sequence-dependent backbone dynamics of IDPs. Of particular interest is the <sup>15</sup>N transverse relaxation rate (<italic>R</italic><sub>2</sub>), which reports on slower dynamics (10s of ns up to 1 μs and beyond). NMR and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations have shown that local interactions and secondary structure formation slow down backbone dynamics and raise <italic>R</italic><sub>2</sub>. Elevated <italic>R</italic><sub>2</sub> has been suggested to be indicators of propensities of membrane association, liquid-liquid phase separation, and other functional processes. Here we present a sequence-based method, SeqDYN, for predicting <italic>R</italic><sub>2</sub> of IDPs. The <italic>R</italic><sub>2</sub> value of a residue is expressed as the product of contributing factors from all residues, which attenuate with increasing sequence distance from the central residue. The mathematical model has 21 parameters, representing the correlation length (where the attenuation is at 50%) and the amplitudes of the contributing factors of the 20 types of amino acids. Training on a set of 45 IDPs reveals a correlation length of 5.6 residues, aromatic and long branched aliphatic amino acids and Arg as <italic>R</italic><sub>2</sub> promotors whereas Gly and short polar amino acids as <italic>R</italic><sub>2</sub> suppressors. The prediction accuracy of SeqDYN is competitive against that of recent MD simulations using IDP-specific force fields.

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) or regions (IDRs) do not have the luxury of a three-dimensional structure to help decipher the relationship between sequence and function. Instead, dynamics has emerged as a crucial link between sequence and function for IDPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>). NMR spin relaxation is a uniquely powerful technique for characterizing IDP dynamics, capable of yielding residue-specific information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>). Backbone <sup>15</sup>N relaxation experiments typically yield three parameters per residue: transverse relaxation rate (<italic>R</italic><sub>2</sub>), longitudinal relaxation rate (<italic>R</italic><sub>1</sub>), and steady-state heteronuclear Overhauser enhancement (NOE). While all the three parameters depend on ps-ns dynamics, <italic>R</italic><sub>2</sub> is the one most affected by slower dynamics (10s of ns to 1 μs and beyond). An increase in either the timescale or the amplitude of slower dynamics results in higher <italic>R</italic><sub>2</sub>. For IDPs, <italic>R</italic><sub>2</sub> is also the parameter that exhibits the strongest dependence on sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>).</p>
<p><italic>R</italic><sub>2</sub> was noted early on as an important indicator of residual structure in the unfolded state of the structured protein lysozyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>). This property has since been measured for many IDPs to provide insight into various biophysical processes. Just as the residual structure in the unfolded state biases the folding pathway of lysozyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>), a nascent α-helix in the free state of Sendai virus nucleoprotein C-terminal domain (Sev-NT), as indicated by highly elevated <italic>R</italic><sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>), biases the coupled binding and folding pathway in the presence of its target phosphoprotein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>). Local secondary structure preformation also facilitates the binding of yes-associated protein (YAP) with its target transcription factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>). Likewise a correlation has been found between <italic>R</italic><sub>2</sub> in the free state and the membrane binding propensity of synaptobrevin-2: residues with elevated <italic>R</italic><sub>2</sub> have increased propensity for membrane binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>). <italic>R</italic><sub>2</sub> in the free state has also been used to uncover factors that promote liquid-liquid phase separation of IDPs. For example, a nascent α-helix (shown by elevated <italic>R</italic><sub>2</sub>) is important for the phase separation of TDP-43 low-complexity domain, as both the deletion of the helical region and a helix-breaking mutation (Ala to Pro) abrogates phase separation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>). Similarly, nascent α-helices in the free state of cytosolic abundant heat-soluble 8 (CAHS-8), upon raising concentration and lowering temperature stabilize to form the core of fibrous gels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>). For hnRNPA1 low-complexity domain (A1-LCD), aromatic residues giving rise to local peaks in <italic>R</italic><sub>2</sub> also mediate phase separation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>).</p>
<p>Both NMR relaxation data and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations have revealed determinants of <italic>R</italic><sub>2</sub> for IDPs. It has been noted that the flexible Gly has a tendency to lower <italic>R</italic><sub>2</sub> whereas secondary structure and contact formation tend to raise <italic>R</italic><sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>). This conclusion agrees well with recent MD simulations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>). These MD studies, using IDP-specific force fields, are able to predict <italic>R</italic><sub>2</sub> in quantitative agreement with NMR measurements, without ad hoc reweighting as done in earlier studies. According to MD, most contact clusters are formed by local sequences, within blocks of up to a dozen or so residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>). Tertiary contacts can also form but are relatively rare; as such their accurate capture requires extremely extensive sampling and still poses a challenge for MD simulations. Opposite to Gly, aromatic residues have been noted as mediators of contact clusters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>).</p>
<p>Schwalbe et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>) introduced a mathematical model to describe the <italic>R</italic><sub>2</sub> profile along the sequence for lysozyme in the unfolded state. The <italic>R</italic><sub>2</sub> value of a given residue was expressed as the sum of contributions from this residues and its neighbors. This model yields a mostly flat profile across the sequence, except for falloff at the termini, resulting an overall bell shape. Klein-Seetharaman et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>) then fit peaks above this flat profile as a sum of Gaussians. Cho et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>) proposed bulkiness as a qualitative indicator of backbone dynamics. Recently Sekiyama et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>) calculated <italic>R</italic><sub>2</sub> as the geometric mean of “indices of local dynamics”; the latter were parameterized by fitting to the measured <italic>R</italic><sub>2</sub> for a single IDP. All these models merely describe the <italic>R</italic><sub>2</sub> profile of a given IDP, and none of them is predictive.</p>
<p>Here we present a method, SeqDYN, for predicting <italic>R</italic><sub>2</sub> of IDPs. Using a mathematical model introduced by Li et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>) to predict propensities for binding nanoparticles and also adapted for predicting propensities for binding membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>), we express the <italic>R</italic><sub>2</sub> value of a residue as the product of contributing factors from all residues. The contributing factor attenuates as the neighboring residue becomes more distant from the central residue. The model, after training on a set of 45 IDPs, has prediction accuracy that is competitive against that of the recent MD simulations using IDP-specific force fields (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>). For lysozyme, the SeqDYN prediction agrees remarkably well with <italic>R</italic><sub>2</sub> measured in the unfolded state.</p>

<title>The data set of IDPs with <italic>R<sub>2</sub></italic> rates</title>
<p>We collected <italic>R</italic><sub>2</sub> data for a total of 54 nonhomologous IDPs or IDRs (Table S1; Fig. S1). According to indicators from NMR properties, including low or negative NOEs, narrow dispersion in backbone amide proton chemical shifts, and small secondary chemical shifts (SCSs), most of the proteins are disordered with at most transient α-helices. A few are partially folded, including Sev-NT with a well-populated (~80%) long helix (residues 478-491) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>), CREB-binding protein fourth intrinsically disordered linker (CBP-ID4) with &gt; 50% propensities for two long helices (residues 2-25 and 101-128) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>), HOX transcription factor DFD (HOX-DFD) with a well-folded domain comprising three helices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>), and Hahellin (apo form) as a molten globule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>). In <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>, we display representative conformations of five IDPs, ranging from fully disordered MAPK kinase 4 (MKK4) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>) and α-synuclein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>) to Measles virus phosphoprotein N-terminal domain (Mev-P<sub>NTD</sub>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>) with transient short helices to Sev-NT and CBP-ID4 with stable long helices. The sequences of all the IDPs are listed in Table S2.</p>

<p>We used 45 of the 54 IDPs to train and validate SeqDYN and reserved the remaining 9 for testing. The sequence lengths of the training set range from 39 to 406 residues, with an average of 125.3 residues. Altogether <italic>R</italic><sub>2</sub> data are available for 3966 residues. A large majority (35 out of 45) of the 45 IDPs have mean <italic>R</italic><sub>2</sub> values (<inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="526886v1_inline1.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula>, calculated among all the residues in a protein) between 2.5 and 5.5 s<sup>−1</sup> (Table S1 and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). This <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="526886v1_inline2.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> range is much lower than that of structured proteins with similar sequence lengths. The low <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="526886v1_inline3.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> values and lack of dependence on sequence length (Fig. S2A) suggest that <italic>R</italic><sub>2</sub> of the IDPs is mostly dictated by local sequence as opposed to tertiary interaction.</p>

<p>The most often used temperature for acquiring the <italic>R</italic><sub>2</sub> data was 298 K, but low temperatures (277 to 280 K) were used in a few cases (Table S1 and Fig. S2B). Of the seven IDPs with <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="526886v1_inline6.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula>, four can be attributed to low temperatures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>), one is due to a relatively low temperature (283 K) as well as the presence of glycerol (20% v/v) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>), and two can be explained by tertiary structure formation [a folded domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>) or molten globule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>)]. A simple reason for higher <italic>R</italic><sub>2</sub> values at lower temperatures is the higher water viscosity, resulting in slowdown in molecular tumbling; a similar effect is achieved by adding glycerol. In some cases, <italic>R</italic><sub>2</sub> was measured at both low and room temperatures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>). To a good approximation, the effect of lowering temperature is a uniform scaling of <italic>R</italic><sub>2</sub> across the IDP sequence. For Sev-NT, downscaling of the <italic>R</italic><sub>2</sub> values at 278 K by a factor of 2.0 brings them into close agreement with those at 298 K (Fig. S2C), with a root-mean-square-deviation (RMSD) of 0.5 s<sup>−1</sup> among all the residues. Likewise, for A1-LCD, downscaling by a factor of 2.4 brings the <italic>R</italic><sub>2</sub> values at 288 K into good match with those at 298 K (Fig. S2D), with an RMSD of 0.4 s<sup>−1</sup>. Because SeqDYN is concerned with the sequence dependence of <italic>R</italic><sub>2</sub>, a uniform scaling has no effect on model parameter or prediction; therefore mixing the data from different temperatures is justified. The same can be said about the different magnetic fields in acquiring the <italic>R</italic><sub>2</sub> data (Table S1 and Fig. S2E). Increasing the magnetic field raises <italic>R</italic><sub>2</sub> values, and the effect is also approximated well by a uniform scaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>).</p>
<p>One measure on the level of sequence dependence of <italic>R</italic><sub>2</sub> is the standard deviation, <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="526886v1_inline7.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula>, calculated among the residues of an IDP. Among the training set, the <italic>R</italic><sub>2</sub> values of 30 IDPs have moderate sequence variations, with <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="526886v1_inline8.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> ranging from 0.5 to 1.5 s<sup>−1</sup> (Table S1); the histogram of <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="526886v1_inline9.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> calculated for the entire training set peaks around 0.75 s<sup>−1</sup> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). There is a moderate correlation between <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="526886v1_inline10.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="526886v1_inline11.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>, inset), reflecting in part the fact that <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="526886v1_inline12.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> can be raised simply by a uniform upscaling, e.g., as a result of lowering temperature. Still, only two of the five IDPs with high <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="526886v1_inline13.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> attributable to lower temperature or presence of glycerol are among the seven IDPs with high sequence variations <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="526886v1_inline14.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula>. Therefore the sequence variation of <italic>R</italic><sub>2</sub> as captured by <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="526886v1_inline15.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> manifests mostly the intrinsic effect of the IDP sequence, not the influence of external factors such as temperature or magnetic field strength. The mean <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="526886v1_inline16.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> value among the training set is 1.24 s<sup>−1</sup>.</p>
<p>One way to eliminate the influence of external factors is to scale the <italic>R</italic><sub>2</sub> values of each IDP by its <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="526886v1_inline17.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> we refer to the results as scaled <italic>R</italic><sub>2</sub>, or s<italic>R</italic><sub>2</sub>. We then pooled the s<italic>R</italic><sub>2</sub> values for all residues in the training set, and separated them according to amino-acid types. The amino acid type-specific mean s<italic>R</italic><sub>2</sub> values, or ms<italic>R</italic><sub>2</sub>, are displayed in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>. The seven amino acids with the highest ms<italic>R</italic><sub>2</sub> are, in descending order, Trp, Arg, Tyr, Phe, Ile, His, and Leu. The presence of all the four aromatic amino acids in this “high-end” group immediately suggests <italic>π</italic>-<italic>π</italic> stacking as important for raising <italic>R</italic><sub>2</sub>; the presence of Arg further implicates cation-<italic>π</italic> interactions. In the other extreme, the seven amino acids with the lowest ms<italic>R</italic><sub>2</sub> are, in ascending order, are Gly, Cys, Val, Asp, Ser, Thr, and Asn. Gly is well-known as a flexible residue; it is also interesting that all the four amino acids with short polar sidechains are found in this “low-end” group. Pro has an excessively low ms<italic>R</italic><sub>2</sub> [with data from only two IDPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>)], but that is due to the absence of an amide proton.</p>

The mean RMSE, <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="526886v1_inline19.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula>, of the null model, equal to 1.24 s<sup>−1</sup> for the training set, serves as the upper bound for evaluating the errors of <italic>R</italic><sub>2</sub> predictors. The next improvement is a one-residue predictor, where first each residue (with index <italic>n</italic>) assumes its amino acid-specific mean s<italic>R</italic><sub>2</sub> (ms<italic>R</italic><sub>2</sub>) and then a uniform scaling factor ϒ is applied:

<p>This one-residue model does only minutely better than the null model, with a <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="526886v1_inline20.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> of 1.22 s<sup>−1</sup>.</p>
<p>In SeqDYN, we account for the influence of neighboring residues. Specifically, each residue <italic>i</italic> contributes a factor <italic>f</italic>(<italic>i</italic>; <italic>n</italic>) to the <italic>R</italic><sub>2</sub> value of residue <italic>n</italic>. Therefore
<disp-formula id="eqn2a">
<alternatives><graphic xlink:href="526886v1_eqn2a.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives>
</disp-formula>
where <italic>N</italic> is the total number of residues in the IDP. The contributing factor depends on the sequence distance <italic>s</italic> = |<italic>i</italic> − <italic>n</italic>| and the amino-acid type of residue <italic>i</italic>:

<p>There are 21 global parameters. The first 20 are the <italic>q</italic> values, one for each of the 20 types of amino acids; the last parameter is <italic>b</italic>, appearing in the Lorentzian form of the sequence-distance dependence. We define the correlation length, <italic>L</italic><sub>corr</sub>, as the sequence distance at which the contributing factor is midway between the values at <italic>s</italic> = 0 and ∞. It is easy to verify that <italic>L</italic><sub>corr</sub> = <italic>b</italic><sup>−1/2</sup>. Note that the single-residue model can be seen as a special case of SeqDYN, with <italic>L</italic><sub>corr</sub> set to 0 and <italic>q</italic> set to ms<italic>R</italic><sub>2</sub>.</p>
<p>The functional forms of <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn2a">Eqs (2a</xref>,<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn2b">b</xref>) were adapted from Li et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>); we also used them for predicting residue-specific membrane association propensities of IDPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>). In these previous applications, a linear term was also present in the denominator of <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn2b">Eq (2b)</xref>. In our initial training of SeqDYN, the coefficient of the linear term always converged to near zero. We thus eliminated the linear term. In addition to the Lorentzian form, we also tested a Gaussian form for the sequence-distance dependence and found somewhat worse performance. The more gradual attenuation of the Lorentzian form with increasing sequence distance evidently provides an overall better model for the <italic>R</italic><sub>2</sub> data in the entire training set. Others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>) have modeled <italic>R</italic><sub>2</sub> as the average of some parameters over a window; a window has an extremely abrupt sequence-distance dependence (1 for <italic>s</italic> &lt; <italic>L</italic><sub>corr</sub> and 0 for 4 &gt; <italic>L</italic><sub>corr</sub>).</p>
<p>We parametrized the SeqDYN model represented by <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn2a">Eqs (2a</xref>,<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn2b">b</xref>) on the training set of 45 IDPs. In addition to the 21 global parameters noted above, there are also 45 local parameters, namely one uniform scaling factor (ϒ) per IDP. The parameter values were selected to minimize the sum of the mean-square-errors for the IDPs in the training set, calculated on <italic>R</italic><sub>2</sub> data for a total of 3924 residues. We excluded the 42 Pro residues in the training set because, as already noted, their <italic>R</italic><sub>2</sub> values are lower for chemical reasons. We will present validation and test results below, but first let us look at the parameter values.</p>
<p>The <italic>q</italic> values are displayed in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref> alongside ms<italic>R</italic><sub>2</sub>. The seven amino acids with the highest <italic>q</italic> values, in descending order, are Trp, Ile, Tyr, Arg, His, Phe, and Leu. These are exactly the same amino acids in the high-end group for ms<italic>R</italic><sub>2</sub>, though their order there is somewhat different. The seven amino acids (excluding Pro) with the lowest <italic>q</italic> values, in ascending order, are Gly, Asn, Ser, Asp, Val, Thr, and Cys. The composition of the low-end group is also identical to that for ms<italic>R</italic><sub>2</sub>. The <italic>q</italic> values thus also suggest that <italic>π</italic>-<italic>π</italic> and cation-<italic>π</italic> interactions in local sequences may raise <italic>R</italic><sub>2</sub>, whereas Gly and short-polar residues may lower <italic>R</italic><sub>2</sub>.</p>
<p>Given the common amino acids at both the high and low ends for ms<italic>R</italic><sub>2</sub> and <italic>q</italic>, it is not surprising that these two properties exhibit a strong correlation, with a coefficient of determination (<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup>; excluding Pro) at 0.92 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). Also, because the high-end group contains the largest amino acids (e.g., Trp and Tyr) whereas the low-end group contains the smallest amino acids (e.g., Gly and Ser), we anticipated some correlation of ms<italic>R</italic><sub>2</sub> and <italic>q</italic> with amino-acid size. We measure the latter property by the molecular mass (<italic>m</italic>). As shown in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>, both ms<italic>R</italic><sub>2</sub> and <italic>q</italic> indeed show medium correlation with <italic>m</italic>, with <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.67 (excluding Pro) and 0.61, respectively. A bulkiness parameter was proposed as an indicator of sequence-dependent backbone dynamics of IDPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>). Bulkiness was defined as the sidechain volume to length ratio, and identifies amino acids with aromatic or branched aliphatic sidechains as bulky (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>). We found only modest correlations between either ms<italic>R</italic><sub>2</sub> or <italic>q</italic> and bulkiness, with <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> just below 0.4 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>).</p>

<p>The optimized value of <italic>b</italic> is 3.164 × 10<sup>−2</sup>, corresponding to an <italic>L</italic><sub>corr</sub> of 5.6 residues. The resulting optimized <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="526886v1_inline21.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> is 0.95 s<sup>−1</sup>, a clear improvement over the value 1.24 s<sup>−1</sup> of the null model. To check the sensitivity of prediction accuracy to <italic>b</italic>, we set <italic>b</italic> to values corresponding to <italic>L</italic><sub>corr</sub> = 0, 1, 2, .., and retrained SeqDYN for <italic>b</italic> fixed at each value. Note that the null-model <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="526886v1_inline22.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula>, 1.24 s<sup>−1</sup>, sets an upper bound. This upper bound is gradually reached when <italic>L</italic><sub>corr</sub> is increased from the optimal value. In the opposite direction, when <italic>L</italic><sub>corr</sub> is decreased from the optimal value, <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="526886v1_inline23.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> rises quickly, reaching 1.22 s<sup>−1</sup> at <italic>L</italic><sub>corr</sub> = 0. The latter <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="526886v1_inline24.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> is the same as that of the single-residue model. Lastly we note that there is strong correlation between the uniform scaling factors and <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="526886v1_inline25.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> values among the 45 IDPs (<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.77), as to be expected. For 39 of the 45 IDPs, ϒ values fall in the range of 0.8 to 2.0 s<sup>−1</sup>.</p>
<p>As presented next, we evaluate the performance of SeqDYN by leave-one-out cross validation, where each IDP in turn was left out of the training set and the model was trained on the remaining 44 IDPs to predict <italic>R</italic><sub>2</sub> for the IDP that was left out. The parameters from the leave-one-out (also known as jackknife) training sessions allow us to assess potential bias of the training set. For this purpose, we compare the values of the 21 global parameters, either from the full training set or from taking the averages of the jackknife training sessions. For each of the <italic>q</italic> parameters, the values from these two methods differ only in the fourth digit; e.g., for Leu, they are both 1.1447 from full training and from jackknife training. The values for <italic>b</italic> are 3.164 × 10<sup>−2</sup> from full training as stated above and 3.163 × 10<sup>−2</sup> from jackknife training. The close agreement in parameter values between full training and jackknife training suggests no significant bias in the training set.</p>
<p>Another question of interest is whether the difference between the <italic>q</italic> parameters of two amino acids is statistically significant. To answer this question, we carried out five-fold cross-validation training, resulting in five independent estimates for each parameter. For example, the mean ± standard deviation of the <italic>q</italic> parameter is 1.1405 ± 0.0066 for Leu and 1.2174 ± 0.0211 for Ile. A t-test shows that their difference is statistically significant (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.0001). In contrast, the difference between Leu and Phe (<italic>q</italic> = 1.1552 ± 0.0304) is not significant.</p>

<title>Validation of SeqDYN predictions</title>
<p>We now present leave-one-out cross-validation results. We denote the RMSE of the <italic>R</italic><sub>2</sub> prediction for the left-out IDP as RMSE(−1). As expected, RMSE(−1) is higher than the RMSE obtained with the IDP kept in the training set, but the increases are generally slight. Specifically, all but eight of the IDPs have increases &lt; 0.1 s<sup>−1</sup>; the largest increase is 0.35 s<sup>−1</sup>, for CBP-ID4. The mean RMSE(−1), or <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="526886v1_inline26.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula>, for the 45 IDPs is increased by 0.05 s<sup>−1</sup> over <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="526886v1_inline27.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula>, to 1.00 s<sup>−1</sup>. The latter value is still a distinct improvement over the mean RMSE 1.24 s<sup>−1</sup> of the null model. The histogram of RMSE(−1) for the 45 IDPs is shown in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>. It peaks at 0.5 s<sup>−1</sup>, which is a substantial downshift from the corresponding peak at 0.75 s<sup>−1</sup> for <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="526886v1_inline28.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>).

<p>To further illustrate the performance of SeqDYN, we present comparison of predicted and measured <italic>R</italic><sub>2</sub> values for five IDPs: MKK4, α-synuclein, Mev-P<sub>NTD</sub>, Sev-NT, and CBP-ID4 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B-F</xref>). A simple common feature is the falloff of <italic>R</italic><sub>2</sub> at the N- and C-termini, resulting from missing upstream or downstream residues that otherwise would be coupled to the terminal residues, as first recognized by Schwalbe et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>). Representative conformations of the five IDPs are displayed in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>, with residues colored according to the predicted <italic>R</italic><sub>2</sub> values. For four of these IDPs, the RMSE(−1) values range from 0.44 to 0.76 s<sup>−1</sup> and are scattered around the peak of the histogram, while the RMSE(−1) for the fifth IDP, namely CBP-ID4, the RMSE(−1) value is 2.01 s<sup>−1</sup> and falls on the tail of the histogram (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>). <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref> displays the measured and predicted <italic>R</italic><sub>2</sub> for MKK4. SeqDYN correctly predicts higher <italic>R</italic><sub>2</sub> values in the second half of the sequence than in the first half. It even correctly predicts the peak around residue Arg75. The sequence in this region is H<sub>72</sub>IERLRTH<sub>79</sub>; six of these eight residues belong to the high-end group. In contrast, the lowest <italic>R</italic><sub>2</sub> values occur in the sequence S<sub>7</sub>GGGGSGGGSGSG<sub>19</sub>, comprising entirely of two amino acids in the low-end group.</p>
<p><italic>R</italic><sub>2</sub> values for α-synuclein are shown in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>. Here SeqDYN correctly predicts higher <italic>R</italic><sub>2</sub> near the C-terminus and a dip around Gly68. However, it misses the <italic>R</italic><sub>2</sub> peaks around Tyr39 and Asp121. MD simulations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>) have found that these <italic>R</italic><sub>2</sub> peaks can be explained by a combination of secondary structure formation (β-sheet around Tyr39 and polyproline II helix around Asp121) and local (between Tyr39 and Ser42) or long-range (between Asp121 and Lys96) interactions. SeqDYN cannot account for long-range interactions (e.g., between β-strands and between Asp121 and Lys96). <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref> shows that SeqDYN gives excellent <italic>R</italic><sub>2</sub> predictions for Mev-P<sub>NTD</sub>. It correctly predicts the high peaks around Arg17, Glu31, Leu193, and lower peaks around Arg235 and Trp285, but does underpredict the narrow peak around Tyr113.</p>
<p>The overall <italic>R</italic><sub>2</sub> profile of Sev-NT is predicted well by SeqDYN, but the peak in the long helical region (residues 478-491) is severely underestimated (green curve in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E</xref>). A similar situation occurs for CBP-ID4, where the peak in the second long helical region (around Glu113) is underpredicted (green curve in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4F</xref>). While the measured <italic>R</italic><sub>2</sub> exhibits a higher peak in the second helical region than in the first helical region (around Arg16), the opposite is predicted by SeqDYN. When the <italic>R</italic><sub>2</sub> data were included in the training set (i.e., full training), the second peak is higher than the first one, but that is not a real prediction because the <italic>R</italic><sub>2</sub> data themselves were used for training the model. It merely means that the SeqDYN functions can be parameterized to produce any prescribed <italic>R</italic><sub>2</sub> profile along the sequence. Indeed, when the <italic>R</italic><sub>2</sub> data of CBP-ID4 alone were used to parameterize SeqDYN, the measured <italic>R</italic><sub>2</sub> profile is closely reproduced (Fig. S3). The reversal in <italic>R</italic><sub>2</sub> peak heights between the two helical regions is the reason for the aforementioned unusual increase in RMSE when CBP-ID4 was left out of the training set.</p>

<sec id="s2d">
<title>R2 boost in long helical regions</title>
<p>It is apparent that SeqDYN underestimates the <italic>R</italic><sub>2</sub> of stable long helices. Transient short helices does not seem to be a problem, since these are present, e.g., in Mev-P<sub>NTD</sub>, where transient helix formation in the first 37 residues and between residues 189-198 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>) coincides with <italic>R</italic><sub>2</sub> peaks that are correctly predicted by SeqDYN. SeqDYN can treat coupling between residues within the correlation length of 5.6 residues, but a much longer helix would tumble more slowly than implied by an <italic>L</italic><sub>corr</sub> of 5.6, and thus it makes sense that SeqDYN would underestimate <italic>R</italic><sub>2</sub> in that case.</p>
<p>Our solution then is to apply a boost factor to the long helical region. To do so, we have to know whether an IDP does form long helices and if so what the constituent residues are. Secondary structure predictors tend to overpredict α-helices and β-strands for IDPs, as they are trained on structured proteins. One way to counter that tendency is to make the criteria for α-helices and β-strands stricter. We found that, by filtering PsiPred (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://bioinf.cs.ucl.ac.uk/psipred">http://bioinf.cs.ucl.ac.uk/psipred</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>) helix propensity scores (<italic>p</italic><sub>Hlx</sub>) with a very high cutoff of 0.99, the surviving helix predictions usually correspond well with residues identified by NMR as having high helix propensities. For example, for Mev-P<sub>NTD</sub>, PsiPred plus filtering predicts residues 14-17, 28-33, and 191-193 as helical; all of them are in regions that form transient helices according to chemical shifts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>). Likewise long helices are also correctly predicted for Sev-NT (residues 477-489) and CBP-ID4 (residues 6-17 and 105-116).</p>
<p>We apply a boost factor, <italic>B</italic><sub>Hlx</sub>, to helices with a threshold length of 12:
<disp-formula id="eqn3">
<alternatives><graphic xlink:href="526886v1_eqn3.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives>
</disp-formula>
</p>
<p>The Θ function is 1 if the helix propensity score is above the filtering cutoff and the helix length (<italic>L</italic><sub>Hlx</sub>) is above the threshold, and 0 otherwise. With a boost amplitude α at 0.5, the boosted SeqDYN prediction for Sev-NT reaches excellent agreement with the measured <italic>R</italic><sub>2</sub> (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E</xref>, red curve). The RMSE(−1) is reduced from 0.76 s<sup>−1</sup> to 0.38 s<sup>−1</sup> upon boosting. Applying the same helix boost to CBP-ID4 also results in a modest reduction in RMSE(−1), from 2.01 to 1.90 s<sup>−1</sup> (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4F</xref>, red curve). The only other IDP for which PsiPred plus filtering predicts a long helix is the N-terminal region of lysyl-tRNA synthetase (KRS-NT). The authors who studied this protein did not report on secondary structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>), but feeding their reported chemical shifts to the TALOS+ server (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://spin.niddk.nih.gov/bax/nmrserver/talos/">https://spin.niddk.nih.gov/bax/nmrserver/talos/</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>) found only short stretches of residues that fall into the helical region of the Ramachandran map. The SeqDYN prediction for KRS-NT is already good [RMSE(−1) = 0.83 s<sup>−1</sup>]; applying a helix boost would deteriorate the RMSE(−1) to 1.16 s<sup>−1</sup>.</p>

<title>Further test on a set of nine IDPs</title>
<p>We have reserved nine IDPs for testing SeqDYN (parameterized on the training set of 45 IDPs). The level of disorder in these test proteins also spans the full range, from absence of secondary structures [ChiZ N-terminal region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>), Pdx1 C-terminal region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>), and TIA-1 prion-like domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>)] to presence of transient short helices [synaptobrevin-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>), α-endosulfine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>), YAP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>), angiomotin-like 1 (AMOTL1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>)] to formation of stable long helices [FtsQ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>) and CAHS-8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>)]. For eight of the nine test IDPs, the RMSEs of SeqDYN predictions are lower than the experimental <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="526886v1_inline30.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> values, by an average of 0.62 s<sup>−1</sup>. For the nineth IDP (Pdx1), the SeqDYN RMSE is slightly higher, by 0.06 s<sup>−1</sup>, than the experimental <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="526886v1_inline31.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula>.</p>
<p>The comparison of predicted and measured <italic>R</italic><sub>2</sub> profiles along the sequence is presented in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A-I</xref>. For ChiZ, SeqDYN correctly predicts the major peak around Arg25 and the minor peak around Arg46 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>). The <italic>R</italic><sub>2</sub> profile of Pdx1 is largely featureless, except for a dip around Gly216, which is correctly predicted by SeqDYN (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>). Correct prediction is also obtained for the higher <italic>R</italic><sub>2</sub> in the first half of TIA-1 prion-like domain than in the second half (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>). SeqDYN gives an excellent prediction for synaptobrevin-2, including a linear increase up to Arg56 and the major peak around Trp89 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D</xref>).</p>

<p>The prediction is also very good for α-endosulfine, including elevated <italic>R</italic><sub>2</sub> around Glu34, which coincides with the presence of a transient helix, and depressed <italic>R</italic><sub>2</sub> in the last 40 residues (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5E</xref>). The only miss is an underprediction for the peak around Lys74. SeqDYN also predicts well the overall shape of the <italic>R</italic><sub>2</sub> profile for YAP, including peaks around Asn70, Leu91, Arg124, and Arg161, but severely underestimates the peak height around Asn70 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5F</xref>).NOE signals indicate contacts between Met86, Leu91, Fhe95, and Fhe96 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>); evidently this type of local contacts is captured well by SeqDYN. The <italic>R</italic><sub>2</sub> elevation around Asn70 is mostly due to helix formation: residues 61-74 have helix propensities up to 40% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>). PsiPred predicts helix for residues 62-73, but only residues 65-68 survive the filtering that we impose, resulting a helix that is too short to apply a helix boost. The prediction for AMOTL1 is mostly satisfactory, including peaks around Phe200 and Arg264 and a significant dip around Gly292 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5G</xref>). However, whereas the two peaks have approximately equal heights in the measured <italic>R</italic><sub>2</sub> profile, the predicted peak height around Phe200 is too low. SCSs indicate helix propensity around both <italic>R</italic><sub>2</sub> peaks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>). PsiPred also predicts helix in both regions, but only five and two residues, respectively, survive after filtering, which are too short for applying a helix boost.</p>
<p>For FtsQ, SeqDYN correctly predicts elevated <italic>R</italic><sub>2</sub> for the long helix [residues 46-74 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>)] but underestimates the magnitude (RMSE = 2.32 s<sup>−1</sup>; green curve in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5H</xref>). PsiPred plus filtering predicts a long helix formed by residues 47-73. Applying the helix boost substantially improves the agreement with the measured <italic>R</italic><sub>2</sub>, with RMSE reducing to 1.71 s<sup>−1</sup> (red curve in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5H</xref>). SeqDYN also gives a qualitatively correct <italic>R</italic><sub>2</sub> profile for CAHS-8, with higher <italic>R</italic><sub>2</sub> for the middle section (residues 95-190) (RMSE = 2.36 s<sup>−1</sup>; green curve in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5I</xref>). However, it misses the extra elevation in <italic>R</italic><sub>2</sub> for the first half of the middle section (residues 95-145). According to SCS, the first and second halves have helix propensities of 60% and 30%, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>). PsiPred plus filtering predicts helices for residues 96-121, 124-141, 169-173, and 179-189. Only the first two helices, both in the first half of the middle section, are considered long according to our threshold. Once again, applying the helix boost leads to marked improvement in the predicted in <italic>R</italic><sub>2</sub>, with RMSE reducing to 1.92 s<sup>−1</sup> (red curve in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5I</xref>).</p>

<title>Inputting the sequence of a structured protein predicts <italic>R</italic><sub>2</sub> in the unfolded state</title>
<p>SeqDYN is trained on IDPs, what if we feed it with the sequence of a structured protein? The prediction using the sequence of hen egg white lysozyme, a well-studied single-domain protein, is displayed in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>. It shows remarkable agreement with the <italic>R</italic><sub>2</sub> profile measured by Klein-Seetharaman et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>) in the unfolded state (denatured by 8 M urea and reduced to break disulfide bridges), including a major peak around Trp62, a second peak around Trp111, and a third peak around Trp123. Klein-Seetharaman et al. mutated Trp62 to Gly and the major peak all but disappeared. This result is also precisely predicted by SeqDYN with the mutant sequence (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We have developed a powerful method, SeqDYN, that predicts the backbone amide transverse relaxation rates (<italic>R</italic><sub>2</sub>) of IDPs. The method is based on IDP sequences, is extremely fast, and available as a web server at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://zhougroup-uic.github.io/SeqDYNidp/">https://zhougroup-uic.github.io/SeqDYNidp/</ext-link>. The excellent performance supports the notion that the ns-dynamics reported by <italic>R</italic><sub>2</sub> is coded by the local sequence, comprising up to 6 residues on either side of a given residue. The amino-acid types that contribute the most to coupling within a local sequence are aromatic (Trp, Tyr, Phe, and His), Arg, and long branched aliphatic (Ile and Leu), suggesting the importance of <italic>π</italic>-<italic>π</italic>, cation-<italic>π</italic>, and hydrophobic interactions in raising <italic>R</italic><sub>2</sub>. These interactions are interrupted by Gly and amino acids with short polar sidechains (Ser, Thr, Asn, and Asp), leading to reduced <italic>R</italic><sub>2</sub>. Transient short helices produce moderate elevation in <italic>R</italic><sub>2</sub>, whereas stable long helices result in a big boost in <italic>R</italic><sub>2</sub>. Tertiary contacts can also raise <italic>R</italic><sub>2</sub>, but appears to be infrequent in most IDPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>).</p>
<p>Our method incorporates ideas from a number of previous efforts at describing <italic>R</italic><sub>2</sub>. The first serious effort was by Schwalbe et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>), who accounted for contributions from neighboring residues as additive terms, instead of multiplicative factors as in SeqDYN. Cho et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>) and Delaforge et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>) used the running average of the bulkiness parameter over a window of five to nine residues as a qualitative indicator of <italic>R</italic><sub>2</sub>. Here again the calculation was based on an additive model. Sekiyama et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>) employed a multiplicative model, with <italic>R</italic><sub>2</sub> calculated as a geometric mean of “indices of local dynamics” over a five-residue window. These indices, akin to our <italic>q</italic> parameters, were trained on a single IDR (TIA-1 prion-like domain) and used to reproduce the measured <italic>R</italic><sub>2</sub> for the same IDR. As we have illustrated on CBP-ID4 (Fig. S3), training on a single protein merely biases the parameters to that model and has little value in predicting <italic>R</italic><sub>2</sub> for other proteins. In comparison, SeqDYN is trained on 45 IDPs and its predictions are robust and achieve quantitative agreement with measured <italic>R</italic><sub>2</sub>.</p>
<p>Ten of the IDPs tested here have been studied recently by MD simulations using IDP-specific force fields (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>). In <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> we compare the RMSEs of SeqDYN predictions with those for <italic>R</italic><sub>2</sub> calculations from MD simulations. For five of these IDPs: A1-LCD, Aβ40, α-synuclein, tau K18, and FtsQ, RMSEs of SeqDYN and MD are remarkably similar. Four of these IDPs lack significant population of α-helices or β-sheets, but FtsQ forms a stable long helix. For one other IDP, namely HOX-DFD, MD, by explicitly modeling its folded domain, does a much better job in predicting <italic>R</italic><sub>2</sub> than SeqDYN (RMSEs of 1.40 s<sup>−1</sup> vs 1.99 s<sup>−1</sup>). However, for the four remaining IDPs: p53TAD, Pup, Sev-NT, and ChiZ, SeqDYN significantly outperforms MD, with RMSEs averaging only 0.47 s<sup>−1</sup>, compared to the MD counterpart of 1.14 s<sup>−1</sup>. Overall, SeqDYN is very competitive against MD in predicting <italic>R</italic><sub>2</sub>, but without the significant computational cost. While MD simulations can reveal details of local interactions, as noted for α-synuclein, and capture tertiary interactions if they occur, they still suffer from perennial problems of force-field imperfection and inadequate sampling. SeqDYN provides an accurate description of IDP dynamics at a “mean-field” level, but could miss idiosyncratic behaviors of specific local sequences.</p>

<p>Deep-learning models have become very powerful, but they usually have millions of parameters and require millions of protein sequences for training (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>). In contrast, SeqDYN employs a mathematical model with dozens of parameters and requires only dozens of proteins for training. Reduced models (by collapsing amino acids into a small number of distinct types) have even been trained on &lt; 10 IDPs to predict propensities for binding nanoparticles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>) or membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>). The mathematical model-based approach may be useful in other applications where data, similar to <italic>R</italic><sub>2</sub>, are limited, including predictions of IDP secondary chemical shifts or residues that bind drug molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>) or protein targets, or even in protein design, e.g., for recognizing an antigenic site or a specific DNA site.</p>

<title>Collection of IDPs with measured <italic>R</italic><sub>2</sub></title>
<p>Starting from six nonhomologous IDPs in our previous MD study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>), we obtained <italic>R</italic><sub>2</sub> data for eight IDPs from the Bimolecular Magnetic Resonance Data Bank (BMRB; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://bmrb.io">https://bmrb.io</ext-link>); data for two other IDPs were from our collaborators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>). Most of the 54 IDPs studied here were from searching the literature. Disorder was judged by dispersion in backbone amide proton chemical shifts, NOE, and SCS. <italic>R</italic><sub>2</sub> data that were not available from the authors or BMRB were obtained by digitizing <italic>R</italic><sub>2</sub> plots presented in figures of published papers, using WebPlotDigitizer (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://automeris.io/WebPlotDigitizer">https://automeris.io/WebPlotDigitizer</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>) and further inspected visually.</p>
<p>Homology of IDPs was checked by sequence alignment using Clustal W (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.clustal.org/clustal2">http://www.clustal.org/clustal2</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>), and presented as a clock-like tree using the “ape” package (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ape-package.ird.fr">http://ape-package.ird.fr</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>). IDPs that had discernible homology with the selected training set were removed. Removed IDPs included HOX-SCR and β-synuclein from our previous MD study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>), due to homology with HOX-DFD and α-synuclein, respectively.</p>

<title>Coding for SeqDYN</title>
<p>The training of SeqDYN was coded in python, similar to our previous work for predicting residue-specific membrane association propensities (ReSMAP; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://zhougroup-uic.github.io/ReSMAPidp/">https://zhougroup-uic.github.io/ReSMAPidp/</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>). The cost function was the sum of mean-squared-errors for the IDPs in the training set. We used the least_squares function in scipy.optimize, with Trust Region Reflective as the minimization algorithm and all parameters restricted to the positive range. For the web server (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://zhougroup-uic.github.io/SeqDYNidp/">https://zhougroup-uic.github.io/SeqDYNidp/</ext-link>), we rewrote the prediction code javascript.</p>

<p>In this <bold>useful</bold> study, a <bold>solid</bold> machine learning approach based on a broad set of systems to predict the R2 relaxation rates of residues in intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) is described. The ability to predict the patterns of R2 will be helpful to guide experimental studies of IDPs. A potential weakness is that the predicted R2 values may include both fast and slow motions, thus the predictions provide only limited new physical insights into the nature of the relevant protein dynamics.</p>

<p>Solution state 15N backbone NMR relaxation from proteins reports on the reorientational properties of the N-H bonds distributed throughout the peptide chain. This information is crucial to understanding the motions of intrinsically disordered proteins and as such has focussed the attention of many researchers over the last 20-30 years, both experimentally, analytically and using numerical simulation.</p>
<p>This manuscript proposes an empirical approach to the prediction of transverse 15N relaxation rates, using a simple formula that is parameterised against a set of 45 proteins. Relaxation rates measured under a wide range of experimental conditions are combined to optimize residue-specific parameters such that they reproduce the overall shape of the relaxation profile. The purely empirical study essentially ignores NMR relaxation theory, which is unfortunate, because it is likely that more insight could have been derived if theoretical aspects had been considered at any level of detail.</p>
<p>Despite some novel aspects, in particular the diversity of the relaxation data sets, the residue-specific parameters do not provide much new insight beyond earlier work that has also noted that sidechain bulkiness correlated with the profile of R2 in disordered proteins.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the manuscript provides an interesting statistical analysis of a diverse set of deposited transverse relaxation rates that could be useful to the community.</p>
<p>
Crucially, and somewhat in contradiction to the authors stated aims in the introduction, I do not feel that the article delivers real insight into the nature of IDP dynamics. Related to this, I have difficulty understanding how an approximate prediction of the overall trend of expected transverse relaxation rates will be of further use to scientists working on IDPs. We already know where the secondary structural elements are (from 13C chemical shifts which are essential for backbone assignment) and the necessary 'scaling' of the profile to match experimental data actually contains a lot of the information that researchers seek.</p>
<p>1. The introduction is confusing, mixing different contributions to R2 as if they emanated from the same physics, which is not necessarily true. 15N transverse relaxation is said to report on 'slower' dynamics from 10s of nanoseconds up to 1 microsecond. Semi-classical Redfield theory shows that transverse relaxation is sensitive to both adiabatic and non-adiabatic terms, due to spin state transitions induced by stochastic motions, and dephasing of coherence due to local field changes, again induced by stochastic motions. These are faster than the relaxation limit dictated by the angular correlation function. Beyond this, exchange effects can also contribute to measured R2. The extent and timescale limit of this contribution depends on the particular pulse sequence used to measure the relaxation. The differences in the pulse sequences used could be presented, and the implications of these differences for the accuracy of the predictive algorithm discussed.</p>
<p>2. Previous authors have noted the correlation between observed transverse relaxation rates and amino acid sidechain bulkiness. Apart from repeating this observation and optimizing an apparently bulkiness-related parameter on the basis of R2 profiles, I am not clear what more we learn, or what can be derived from such an analysis. If one can possibly identify a motif of secondary structure because raised R2 values in a helix, for example, are missed from the prediction, surely the authors would know about the helix anyway, because they will have assigned the 13C backbone resonances, from which helical propensity can be readily calculated.</p>
<p>3. Transverse relaxation rates in IDPs are often measured to a precision of 0.1s-1 or less. This level of precision is achieved because the line-shapes of the resonances are very narrow and high resolution and sensitivity are commonly measurable. The predictions of relaxation rates, even when applying uniform scaling to optimize best-agreement, is often different to experimental measurement by 10 or 20 times the measured accuracy. There are no experimental errors in the figures. These are essential and should be shown for ease of comparison between experiment and prediction.</p>
<p>4. The impact of structured elements on the dynamic properties of IDPs tethered to them is very well studied in the literature. Slower motions are also increased when, for example the unfolded domain binds a partner, because of the increased slow correlation time. The ad hoc 'helical boosting' proposed by the authors seems to have the opposite effect. When the helical rates are higher, the other rates are significantly reduced. I guess that this is simply a scaling problem. This highlights the limitation of scaling the rates in the secondary structural element by the same value as the rest of the protein, because the timescales of the motion are very different in these regions. In fact the scaling applied by the authors contains very important information. It is also not correct to compare the RMSD of the proposed method with MD, when MD has not applied a 'scaling'. This scaling contains all the information about relative importance of different components to the motion and their timescales, and here it is simply applied and not further analysed.</p>
<p>5. Generally, the uniform scaling of all values by the same number is serious oversimplification. Motions are happening on all timescales they are giving rise to different transverse relaxation. It is not possible to describe IDP relaxation in terms of one single motion. Detailed studies over more than 30 years, have demonstrated that more than one component to the autocorrelation function is essential in order to account for motions on different timescales in denatured, partially disordered or intrinsically unfolded states. If one could 'scale' everything by the same number, this would imply that only one timescale of motion were important and that all others could be neglected, and this at every site in the protein. This is not expected to be the case, and in fact in the examples shown by the authors it is also never the case. There are always regions where the predicted rates are very different from experiment (with respect to experimental error), presumably because local dynamics are occurring on different timescales to the majority of the molecule. These observations contain useful information, and the observation that a single scaling works quite well probably tells us that one component of the motion is dominant, but not universally. This could be discussed.</p>
<p>6. With respect to the accuracy of the prediction, discussion about molecular detail such as pi-pi interactions and phase separation propensity is possibly a little speculative.</p>
<p>7. The authors often declare that the prediction reproduces the experimental data. The comparisons with experimental data need to be presented in terms of the chi2 per residue, using the experimentally measured precision which as mentioned, is often very high.</p>

<p>Qin, Sanbo and Zhou, Huan-Xiang created a model, SeqDYN, to predict nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spin relaxation spectra of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs), based primarily on amino acid sequence. To fit NMR data, SeqDYN uses 21 parameters, 20 that correspond to each amino acid, and a sequence correlation length for interactions. The model demonstrates that local sequence features impact the dynamics of the IDP, as SeqDYN performs better than a one residue predictor, despite having similar numbers of parameters. SeqDYN is trained using 45 IDP sequences and is retrained using both leave-one-out cross validation and five-fold cross validation, ensuring the model's robustness. While SeqDYN can provide reasonably accurate predictions in many cases, the authors note that improvements can be made by incorporating secondary structure predictions, especially for alpha-helices that exceed the correlation length of the model. The authors apply SeqDYN to study nine IDPs and a denatured ordered protein, demonstrating its predictive power. The model can be easily accessed via the website mentioned in the text.</p>
<p>While the conclusions of the paper are primarily supported by the data, there are some points that could be extended or clarified.</p>
<p>1. The authors state that the model includes 21 parameters. However, they exclude a free parameter that acts as a scaling factor and is necessary to fit the experimental data (lambda). As a result, SeqDYN does not predict the spectrum from the sequence de-novo, but requires a one parameter fitting. The authors mention that this factor is necessary due to non-sequence dependent factors such as the temperature and magnetic field strength used in the experiment. Given these considerations, would it be possible to predict what this scaling factor should be based on such factors?</p>
<p>2. The authors mention that the Lorentzian functional form fits the data better than a Gaussian functional form, but do not present these results.</p>
<p>3. The authors mention that they conducted five-fold cross validation to determine if differences between amino acid parameters are statistically significant. While two pairs are mentioned in the text, there are 190 possible pairs, and it would be informative to more rigorously examine the differences between all such pairs.</p>

<p>The manuscript by Qin and Zhou presents an approach to predict dynamical properties of an intrinsically disordered protein (IDP) from sequence alone. In particular, the authors train a simple (but useful) machine learning model to predict (rescaled) NMR R2 values from sequence. Although these R2 rates only probe some aspects of IDR dynamics and the method does not provide insight into the molecular aspects of processes that lead to perturbed dynamics, the method can be useful to guide experiments.</p>
<p>A strength of the work is that the authors train their model on an observable that directly relates to protein dynamics. They also analyse a relatively broad set of proteins which means that one can see actual variation in accuracy across the proteins.</p>
<p>A weakness of the work is that it is not always clear what the measured R2 rates mean. In some cases, these may include both fast and slow motions (intrinsic R2 rates and exchange contributions). This in turn means that it is actually not clear what the authors are predicting. The work would also be strengthened by making the code available (in addition to the webservice), and by making it easier to compare the accuracy on the training and testing data.</p>
