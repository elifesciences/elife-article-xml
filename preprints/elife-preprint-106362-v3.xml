<abstract>
<title>Abstract</title><p>Impairments of locus coeruleus (LC) are implicated in anxiety/depression and Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Increases in cytosolic noradrenaline (NA) concentration and MAO-A activity initiate the LC impairment through production of NA metabolite, 3,4-dihydroxyphenyl- glycolaldehyde (DOPEGAL), by MAO-A. However, how NA accumulates in soma/dendritic cytosol of LC neurons has never been addressed despite the fact that NA is virtually absent in cytosol while NA is produced exclusively in cytoplasmic vesicles from dopamine by dopamine-β-hydroxylase. Since re-uptake of autocrine-released NA following spike activity is the major source of NA accumulation, we investigated whether and how chronic stress can increase the spike activity accompanied by NA-autocrine. Overexcitation of LC neurons is normally prevented by the autoinhibition mediated by activation of α2A-adrenergic receptor (AR)-coupled inwardly rectifying potassium-current (GIRK-I) with autocrine-released NA. Patch-clamp study revealed that NA-induced GIRK-I in LC neurons was decreased in chronic restraint stress (RS) mice while a similar decrease was gradually caused by repeated excitation. Chronic RS caused internalization of α2A-ARs expressed in cell membrane in LC neurons and decreased protein/mRNA levels of α2A-ARs/GIRKs in membrane fraction. Subsequently, chronic RS increased the protein levels of MAO-A, DOPEGAL-induced asparagine endopeptidase (AEP) and tau N368. These results suggest that chronic RS-induced overexcitation due to the internalization of α2A-ARs/GIRK is accompanied by [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]i increases, subsequently increasing Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent MAO-A activity and NA-autocrine. Thus, it is likely that internalization of α2A-AR increased cytosolic NA, as reflected in AEP increases, by facilitating re-uptake of autocrine-released NA. The suppression of α2A-AR internalization may have a translational potential for anxiety/AD treatment.</p>

<title>Background</title>
<p>Locus coeruleus (LC) is implicated in anxiety and depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Itoi and Sugimoto, 2010</xref>), and is often the first place where Alzheimer’s disease (AD)-related pathology appears (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Mather and Harley, 2016</xref>). Noradrenaline (NA) is known to inhibit amyloid-induced oxidative stress, and caspase activation in cortex/hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Counts and Mufson, 2010</xref>). Thus, the impairment of LC-noradrenergic system is potentially involved in the AD pathogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Ross et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Chen et al., 2022</xref>).</p>
<p>It was reported that cytosolic NA in the soma/dendrites of LC neurons is degraded by monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A) into 3,4-dihydroxyphenyl-glycolaldehyde (DOPEGAL) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Burke et al., 1999</xref>), which generates apoptotic free radicals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Burke et al., 1998</xref>) and activates asparagine endopeptidase (AEP) to produce Aβ and hypephosphorylated tau, consequently leading to AD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Burke et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Kang et al., 2020</xref>). However, there appears normally no NA except dopamine in the cytosol of LC neurons because NA is produced exclusively in cytoplasmic vesicles by dopamine-β-hydroxylase (DBH) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Potter and Axelrod, 1963</xref>) from dopamine which is taken up into cytoplasmic vesicles by vesicular monoamine transporter type 2 (VMAT2).</p>
<p>LC neurons release NA following action potential not only from the axon terminals but also from their cell bodies as autocrine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Huang et al., 2007</xref>), and autocrine-released NA activates α2A adrenergic receptor (α2A-AR) expressed on the soma/dendrites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Aoki et al., 1994</xref>), resulting in activation of α2-AR-coupled inwardly rectifying K<sup>+</sup> (GIRK) channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Arima et al., 1998</xref>) to cause autoinhibition (spike-afterhyperpolarization) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Williams et al., 1985</xref>). Thus, overexcitation of LC neurons is normally prevented by the autoinhibition.</p>
<p>As autocrine-released NA is taken up by NA-transporter (NAT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Torres et al., 2003</xref>), uptaken-NA may be the only source of free NA to be metabolized by MAO-A in the cytosol of LC neurons. However, the amount of free NA to be metabolized by MAO-A in the cytosol is thought to be very small due to a much lower affinity of NA to MAO-A compared to VMAT2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Costa, 2012</xref>). Therefore, it is not clear how free NA to be metabolized by MAO-A is increased in the soma/dendites of LC neurons in AD pathogenesis. Because the passive NA-leakage occurs from cytoplasmic vesicles in a manner that achieves a dynamic equilibrium with active NA-storage into cytoplasmic vesicles by VMAT2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Eisenhofer et al., 2004</xref>), increased NA- uptake by NAT in response to increased NA-autocrine following [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]i increases or overexcitation may increase free NA by facilitating the passive NA-leakage from cytoplasmic vesicles. Furthermore, the affinity of MAO-A for NA may be modifiable as MAO-A activity is Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Cao et al., 2007</xref>). Then, a question arises whether or not impairment of autoinhibition that causes overexcitation and [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]i increases can consequently increase AEP activity through the production of DOPEGAL.</p>
<p>Neuronal activity in LC neurons is transiently increased by stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Valentino and Foote, 1988</xref>) through activation of corticotropin releasing factor (CRF) receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Valentino et al., 19838</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">McCall et al., 2015</xref>) together with glutamate receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Valentino et al., 2001</xref>). However, even if firing activity is increased by synaptic activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Barcomb et al., 2022</xref>), autoinhibition would occur to suppress overexcitation in LC neurons. Nevertheless, it is known that long- term overexcitation due to chronic stress ultimately causes degeneration of LC neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Kitayama et al., 2004</xref>). Then, this raises an important question whether and how stress impairs autoinhibition to cause sustained overexcitation. The whole mechanisms for the impairment of LC would be revealed by solving these questions. Here we examined whether the autoinhibition mediated by α2A-AR-coupled GIRK-I is impaired by overexcitation in LC neurons or chronic stress, to clarify the mechanisms for NA accumulation and/or MAO-A activity increase.</p>

<title>Spike frequency adaptation in LC neurons is mediated by α2-AR-coupled GIRK channel</title>
<p>LC neurons invariably display spike-frequency adaptation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A, B</xref>). We have hypothesized that the autoinhibition would occur following respective spike firing and contribute to the generation of the spike-frequency adaptation and the afterhyperpolarization seen at the offset of current pulses.</p>

<p>When the cumulative number of spikes was plotted against the elapsed time from the onset of the current pulse every 50 ms, the cumulative spike number increased non-linearly in a saturation manner (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). This non-linear relationship was fitted with a saturation curve defined by Monod equation (see Extended Methods and Materials) in order to quantify the spike-frequency adaptation. Because there was no significant difference in <bold><italic>b</italic></bold> between the two groups of spike trains, the profile of the normalized cumulative spike number vs the elapsed time remains the same regardless of firing frequency, suggesting that spike-frequency adaptation occurs in the same way.</p>
<p>The spike-frequency adaptation observed was almost completely abolished by a blocker of α2-AR, atipamezole (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D, E</xref>), which subsequently largely decreased pulse- afterhyperpolarization (pulse-AHP) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D, E</xref>, blue and red stars). The cumulative spike number increased non-linearly in a saturation manner in the control condition while it increased almost in a linear manner after atipamezole application (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>). In the relationship between <bold><italic>a</italic></bold> and <bold><italic>b</italic></bold> examined in LC neurons, atipamezole invariably and significantly shifted both <bold><italic>a</italic></bold> and <bold><italic>b</italic></bold> in a larger direction, and there was a significant difference in the relationship between <bold><italic>a</italic></bold> and <bold><italic>b</italic></bold> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G</xref>).</p>
<p>Bath application of NA induced a GIRK-I in response to the ramp pulse (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1H</xref>, red trace) whereas addition of atipamezole to NA almost completely abolished the NA-induced GIRK-I (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1H</xref>, blue trace), showing that GIRK-I reversed at –97 mV. The amplitudes of the inward component of NA-induced GIRK-I were invariably larger than those of the outward component, consistent with the inwardly rectifying property of GIRK-I. Atipamezole significantly decreased the amplitudes of the inward and outward components (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1I</xref>). Taken together, NA-autocrine is likely to be caused following respective spikes in the LC neuron and NA is accumulated around the LC neuron to activate α2-AR-coupled GIRK channels, to cause spike-frequency adaptation by enhancing AHP.</p>

<title>Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent rundown of NA-induced GIRK-I in LC neurons</title>
<p>In PC12 cells, heterologously expressed α2A-ARs undergo internalization following agonist application (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Taraviras et al., 2002</xref>). Such internalization of α2A-ARs would result in an abolishment of GIRK-I or desensitization given the functional coupling between α2A-AR and GIRK as in LC noradrenergic neurons. However, in LC neurons, NA-induced GIRK-I showed almost no rundown/desensitization after repeating the ramp pulse 20 times in the persistent presence of NA (Figure supplement 1A-D). Then, we next examined whether GIRK-I shows rundown under the condition of “increased excitability” or increased [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]i, because acute/chronic stress increases the excitability of LC neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Borodovitsyna et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Campos-Lira et al., 2018</xref>) and various channels/receptors are known to be internalized in a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Beattie et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Aziz et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Zaccor et al., 2020</xref>).</p>
<p>To examine the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependency of the rundown of GIRK-I, the respective ramp pulses to evoke GIRK-I were preceded by various pulse trains which can induce Ca<sup>2+</sup> currents differentially (compare Figure supplement 1F and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). After examining various pulse protocols (Figures supplement 1 and 2), the best protocol to induce a prominent rundown of GIRK-I was as follows (shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). First, bath application of NA induced GIRK-I (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>, red trace; 2) that showed the inwardly rectifying profile as revealed by subtraction of the control response from that obtained after NA application (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>, red trace; 2 ̶ 1).</p>

<p>Subsequently, the combined command pulse (a set of 5 trains of 20 pulses followed by a ramp pulse; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>, upper trace) was applied every minute. The positive pulse trains evoked large inward Ca<sup>2+</sup> currents in the presence of extracellular 30 mM TEA (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>, lower traces) whereas similar trains of the same positive pulse hardly induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> currents when applied in the absence of TEA (Figure supplement 1F, lower trace). With repetition of the combined command pulse 20 times, the NA-induced GIRK-I (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>, red trace; 2) was decreased to almost the same current as the control response (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>, blue trace; 3). Indeed, no GIRK-I remained after 20 times repetition of the combined command pulse as revealed by the subtraction between trace 1 and trace 3 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>, blue trace; 3 ̶ 1). Both the amplitudes of the inward and outward components of the NA-induced GIRK-I promptly decreased to zero along with repetition of the combined command pulse (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>, blue and red circles; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>). Thus, it is likely that NA-induced GIRK-I displays a marked rundown in a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent manner. Furthermore, we confirmed that these rundowns were completely dependent on the number and application timing of the command pulse in the presence or absence of TEA (compare <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref> with Figures supplement 1 and 2). Depending on the absence or presence TEA, the single application of a set of 10 trains of 20 pulses differentially (slightly or moderately, respectively) induced the rundown of NA-induced GIRK-I (compare Figure supplement 1E-J and Figure supplement 2A-E). By contrast, the repetitive application of a single train of 20 positive pulses in the presence of TEA markedly facilitated the rundown of NA-induced GIRK-I (Figure supplement 2F-K). The relationship between the number of spikes (i.e., positive pulse) and [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]i was obtained by measuring Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients using fura-2 (Figure supplement 3).</p>
<p>To investigate the effects of the rundown of GIRK-I on the spike-frequency adaptation, spike trains were examined before and after the voltage-clamp experiment (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A-F</xref>). After the rundown of GIRK-I was observed in the voltage-clamp experiment, the spike- frequency adaptation was absent in the current clamp experiment, and the pulse-ADP was largely reduced (Figure supplement 4A-D). The cumulative spike number that increased non- linearly in a saturation manner before rundown of GIRK-I increased almost in a linear manner after rundown of GIRK-I (Figure supplement 4E, F). Thus, the rundown of GIRK-I invariably resulted in an abolishment of spike-frequency adaptation, similar to the effects of atipamezole on spike-frequency adaptation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). Therefore, it is likely that Ca<sup>2+</sup> increases can cause the rundown of NA-induced GIRK-I and almost abolished the spike- frequency adaptation, leading to an increase in the excitability of LC neurons. These observations suggest that [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]i increases cause rundown of NA-induced GIRK-I to suppress autoinhibition, leading to excitability increases that cause further increases in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]i to further cause a rundown of the GIRK-I.</p>
<p>It was also examined whether the rundown of NA-induced GIRK-I can be caused solely by [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]i increases without activation of α2-AR. We found that NA-induced GIRK-I subjected to the combined command pulse 20 times in the presence of atipamezole was significantly restored after washout of atipamezole in the presence of NA (Figure supplement 5A-D). This observation indicates that GIRK-I were not downregulated solely by [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]i increases without activation of α2-AR, clearly revealing that both the activation of α2-AR and [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]i increases are necessary to cause the downregulation of GIRK-I. In agreement with this result, the spike-frequency adaptation reflecting the autoinhibition was also preserved in spite of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]i increases as long as activation of α2-AR is prevented (Figures supplement 5E-J). We further examined whether the rundown of NA-induced GIRK-I can be prevented by the presence of a GIRK channel blocker, tertiapin-Q. GIRK channel blockade did not prevent the rundown of NA-induced GIRK currents following [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]i increases (Figure supplement 6A- H). In agreement with this result, the spike-frequency adaptation was not preserved by with the blockade of GIRK channels during [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]i increases (Figure supplement 6I-N). These findings showed that α2-AR blockade but not GIRK blockade prevented the rundown of NA- induced GIRK-I following [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]i increases. Taken together, it is suggested that the rundown of NA-induced GIRK-I may be brought about by the internalization of α2-AR in a Ca<sup>2+</sup>- dependent manner, regardless of opening or closing of GIRK channels.</p>

<title>β-Arrestin is involved in the rundown of NA-induced GIRK-I</title>
<p>We further examined whether the internalization of α2-AR is involved in the rundown of NA- induced GIRK-I or not. As β-arrestin/AP2 complex is known to be involved in the agonist- dependent internalization of GPCR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">DeGraff et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Cottingham et al., 2011</xref>), we examined the effects of barbadin, which prevents AP2 from binding with β-arrestin by forming barbadin/AP2 complex, on the rundown of NA-induced GIRK-I. With the patch pipettes filled with barbadin-including internal solution, it was examined whether NA-induced GIRK-I displays rundown in response to the same combined command pulse (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2H</xref>, upper trace) as that in the control experiment (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>, upper trace). The NA-induced GIRK-I (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2G-I</xref>, red traces) was hardly decreased (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2H, I</xref>, blue traces) after repeating the combined pulse 20 times, in contrast to the control rundown (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C, D</xref>). Barbadin largely suppressed the rundown of the both components of GIRK-I (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2J, K</xref>). These results suggest that the rundown of NA-induced GIRK-I is caused by the internalization of α2-AR-coupled GIRK channels.</p>

<title>Restraint stress alters α2A-AR expression in LC neurons</title>
<p>We next investigated whether the expression of α2A-AR is altered in LC neurons by applying restraint stress (RS) to mice. After mice were subjected to daily 12-h RS for 3 days followed by non-stress condition for 2 days, the immunoreactivity for α2A-ARs (see Figure supplement 7) seen along the membrane of TH-positive LC neurons was apparently lower compared to the control (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A, B</xref>). Consistent with this observation, Western blot analysis revealed significantly lower protein levels of α2A-ARs in LC neurons obtained after 3-day RS compared to the control (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>). Especially when α2A-ARs expression was examined in the membrane fraction identified using Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase, the immunoreactivity for α2A-ARs expression was apparently lower in LC neurons of RS mice than in those of the control mice (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D, E</xref>; *, compare the rightmost lower panels). Consistent with this observation, Western blot analysis revealed a significantly lower protein level of α2A-ARs in the membrane fraction of LC neurons of RS mice compared to the control whereas there was no significant difference in the cytosol between the control and RS mice (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F, G</xref>). Thus, the internalization of α2A-ARs is not necessarily accompanied by increases in cytosolic levels of α2A-ARs because the internalized receptors are either recycled or degraded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Koenig and Ikeda, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Takei et al., 1996</xref>).</p>

<title>Histological and biochemical changes in LC neurons after 5-day RS</title>
<p>Next, immunohistochemical experiments demonstrated that 5-day RS appeared to slightly increase the expressions of TH and MAO-A in LC neurons (Figure supplement 8A). Furthermore, AEP expression also appeared to increase in cytosol after 5-day RS compared to the control (Figure supplement 8B). Because TH catalyzes the rate limiting step in the synthesis of catecholamines, if the RS enhances TH activity, free NA concentration in LC neurons would be directly and greatly increased. Therefore, we first carefully examined whether TH is really upregulated in RS mice or not by performing Western blot analysis. No significant increase in the protein level of TH was observed in 5-day RS mice compared to the control (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>, upper panel; <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>). This result clearly indicates that TH activity was not significantly upregulated in 5-day RS mice, in spite of the TH immunohistochemical experiment. We further examined whether protein levels of MAO-A and AEP are increased or not by 5-day RS. Western blot analysis revealed significant increases in the protein levels of MAO-A (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>, lower panel; <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>) and of pro-AEP and active AEP (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D- F</xref>) in LC neurons after 5-day RS compared to the control. Western blot analysis also revealed a significant increase in the expression of tau and tau N368 fragment after 5-day RS (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5G-I</xref>). Thus, an increased activity of active AEP caused a production of tau N368 fragments as observed at 37 and 35 kDa (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5G</xref>), which is consistent with a previous report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>). Relative protein levels of the tau N368 fragments (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5I</xref>) were the mean values obtained from the two band intensities, which may reflect the two N-terminal fragments (upper and lower bands) generated by AEP cleavage at Asn-368 of the 4 and 3 repeat-tau isoforms, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Goedert et al., 1989</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We have found that LC neurons display spike-frequency adaptation which is caused by the autoinhibition mediated by α2A-AR-coupled GIRK-I following respective spikes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>) and that α2A-AR-coupled GIRK-I showed Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent rundown due to the internalization of α2A-AR (Figure 2, Figure supplement 5A-D and Figure supplement 6E-H), leading to the abolishment of spike-frequency adaptation and the excitability increase (Figure supplement 4). Immunohistochemical examination and Western blot analysis revealed that α2A-AR expression in cell membrane was decreased following RS (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4J</xref>). Consistently, NA-induced GIRK-I was decreased in LC neurons with an increase in the period of RS (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A-G</xref>). Following chronic RS, protein levels of MAO-A, pro-/active-AEP, and tau and tau N368 fragment were significantly increased (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A, C-I</xref>).</p>
<p>Based on these results, we propose a novel mechanism for how chronic RS impairs autoinhibition and increases cytosolic free NA to be metabolized by enhanced Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent MAO-A activity, to consequently increase AEP activity and produce tau N368 protein (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>). In non-stress mice, autocrine released NA is slowly taken up by NAT after binding to α2A- ARs to cause autoinhibition (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>), while in chronic RS mice, autocrine-released NA may be directly and rapidly taken up by NAT due to the absence (internalization) of α2A-ARs (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>). Such increased rate of re-uptake of NA by NAT would increase free NA concentration by facilitating the leakage of NA from cytoplasmic vesicles in the cell body, which would be metabolized by upregulated MAO-A activity to DOPEGAL, as revealed by the increased activity of AEP in chronic RS mice (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>). It may be further necessary to perform enzymatic assay to better demonstrate the AEP and MAO-A activities.</p>

    <caption><title>Presumed cellular mechanisms for the degeneration of LC by stress.</title>
    <p>(<bold>A, B</bold>) Differential free concentrations of NA to be metabolized by MAO-A into DOPEGAL between control and stress conditions: Under the control condition (<bold>A</bold>), NA in the cytosol is mostly taken up into the cytoplasmic vesicles by VMAT2 (thick arrow 3), rather than being directly metabolized by MAO-A into DOPEGAL (thin interrupted arrow). Vesicular NA is released from cell bodies as autocrine following [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]i increases caused by action potentials, and the released NA activates α2A-AR-coupled GIRK channels, causing autoinhibition. Subsequently, the autocrine released NA is slowly taken up into the cytosol of LC neurons by NAT after dissociation from α2A-ARs. Under the stress condition (<bold>B</bold>), an activation of CRF receptors in LC neurons by stress inhibits leak K<sup>+</sup> channels and increases firing activities in LC neurons, subsequently causing a larger [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]i increase together with Ca<sup>2+</sup>-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> release (CICR). Impairment of autoinhibiton due to Ca<sup>2+</sup> dependent internalization of α2A-ARs-coupled GIRK channels leads to the persistent excitation in LC neurons, which enhances autocrine release of NA (thick arrow 1). Subsequently, the excessively autocrine released NA is taken up directly and rapidly by NAT into the cytosol without binding to α2A-ARs (thick arrow 2). Such a facilitation of re-uptake of NA by NAT would increase active NA storage into cytoplasmic vesicles by VMAT2 (thick arrow 3), while the rate of NA leakage from cytoplasmic vesicles would also increase (arrow 4) due to a dynamic equilibrium in cytoplasmic vesicles between active NA storage into cytoplasmic vesicles and passive NA leakage from cytoplasmic vesicles. Subsequently, such an increase in the rate of NA leakage would result in an increase in a MAO-A metabolite, DOPEGAL and AEP, leading to a production of cleaved tau N368 fragment and an impairment of learning/memory.</p></caption>

<title>Spike frequency adaptation</title>
<p>LC neurons display spike-frequency adaptation. The mechanism for the spike-frequency adaptation may be different among neurons while M currents are usually responsible for the adaptation in hippocampal pyramidal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Aiken et al., 1995</xref>). In LC neurons, the spike- frequency adaptation was mediated by α2A-AR-coupled GIRK-I as the spike-frequency adaptation was abolished by atipamezole (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D-G</xref>) and by causing the rundown of GIRK- I (Figure supplement 4). These results suggest that autocrine NA release following respective spikes activated α2A-ARs expressed in the soma/dendrites of LC neurons, and subsequently activated α2A-AR-coupled GIRK-I to cause autoinhibition as spike-frequency adaptation. Thus, spike-frequency adaptation clearly reflects NA-autocrine.</p>

<title>Rundown of α2A-AR-coupled GIRK-I</title>
<p>α2A-AR-coupled GIRK-I displayed Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent rundown in the presence of agonist. The degree and time course of rundown of α2A-AR-coupled GIRK-I were dependent on the number and timing of positive pulses applied under voltage-clamp condition to cause Ca<sup>2+</sup> currents (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A-F</xref> and Figures supplement 1E-J, 2, 3). Given the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependency of the rundown of autoinhibition, the excitability of LC neurons would increase as LC neurons were excited more such as under RS condition, resulting in a vicious cycle between excitability increase accompanied by [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]i increase and rundown of autoinhibition/Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent internalization of α2A-ARs.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s3c">
<title>Internalization of α2A-ARs</title>
<p>Activation of GPCR by agonist binding usually causes the formation of GPCR/β-arrestin complexes. Subsequently, the GPCR/β-arrestin complex is assembled through the interaction between β-arrestin and AP2 in clathrin-coated pits (CCPs), which is formed by the association of AP2 with phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) at the plasma membrane, leading to endocytosis of GPCRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Pierce and Lefkowitz, 2001</xref>). PIP2 is locally produced from the membrane phosphatidylinositol (PI) by PI4/PIP5 kinases in a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Sarmento et al., 2014</xref>). Barbadin prevented the stable formation of sufficient GPCR/β- arrestin/AP2 complexes in CCPs as barbadin prevents AP2 from binding with β-arrestin by forming barbadin/AP2 complex, thereby hampering GPCR internalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Beautrait et al., 2017</xref>). In the present study, intracellular barbadin effectively suppressed the rundown of GIRK-I (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2G-K</xref>), indicating that the rundown of GIRK-I was caused by the internalization of α2A-ARs in LC neurons.</p>

<title>Chronic RS increases the activities of MAO-A and pro-/active-AEP in the cell body</title>
<p>Chronic cold stress reduced α2-AR mediated inhibition of LC neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Jedema et al., 2008</xref>), and chronic social stress downregulated α2-ARs in the LC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Flugge, 1996</xref>). Our present results were consistent with those previous findings: Following RS, α2A-ARs expression was decreased due to the internalization of α2A-ARs (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>), together with the decreases in NA- induced GIRK-I (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A-G</xref>) which mediates the autoinhibition. As long as RS persists, the impairment of autoinhibition leads to the persistent overexcitation in LC neurons. This would further increase NA-autocrine, because respective spikes were accompanied by NA-autocrine as reflected in spike-frequency adaptation or autoinhibition.</p>
<p>As extracellular NA is mostly taken up into cytosol by NAT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Torres et al., 2003</xref>), it is likely that under chronic RS the increased autocrine-released NA is directly and more rapidly taken up by NAT due to the absence of α2A-ARs (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>). Such an increase in the rate of NA uptake by NAT is similar to the effects of uptake inhibitor of transmitter ligand on the activity of receptors. After re-uptake of NA by NAT, a large portion of NA in the cytosol is restored in cytoplasmic vesicles by VMAT2 while only a small portion of NA can escape from VMAT2 to be metabolized by MAO-A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Eisenhofer et al., 1992</xref>), because VMAT2 has a much higher affinity for NA than MAO-A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Bloom, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Costa, 2012</xref>). However, there is an additional component of NA to be metabolized by MAO-A, as NA can leak from cytoplasmic vesicles into cytosol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Eisenhofer et al., 2004</xref>). When re-uptake of NA by NAT is facilitated due to the internalization of α2A-ARs in response to NA-autocrine, active NA storage into cytoplasmic vesicles by VMAT2 would increase. Then, the rate of NA leakage from cytoplasmic vesicles would also increase because passive NA leakage from cytoplasmic vesicles and active NA storage into cytoplasmic vesicles by VMAT2 are in a dynamic equilibrium in cytoplasmic vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Eisenhofer et al., 2004</xref>). Subsequently, such increases in the rate of NA leakage would result in increases in a MAO-A metabolite, DOPEGAL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Goldstein, 2021</xref>) (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>). Indeed, it has previously been demonstrated that a partial inhibition of NAT in human subjects reduced the original level of a derivative of DOPEGAL (3,4-dihydroxyphenylglycol; DHPG) in CSF by more than 50% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Kielbasa et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, free NA to be metabolized by MAO-A would be increased when autocrine-released NA is taken up by NAT. On the other hand, it is also known that the decreased VMAT2 levels, generated in VMAT2 heterozygote mice, increased the vulnerability of nigral dopamine neurons to MPTP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Takahashi et al., 1997</xref>). Thus, it is conceivable that NA leakage for free NA accumulation is influenced by both NAT or VMAT2.</p>
<p>Therefore, under the chronic RS condition, more NA leaked from cytoplasmic vesicles is likely to be metabolized by MAO-A, which activity is enhanced Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependently and by chronic RS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Cao et al., 2007</xref>) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5A</xref><bold>, C and 6B</bold>), to DOPEGAL compared to the control condition, as revealed by the increased protein levels of pro-AEP and active-AEP (Figure supplement 8B and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D-F</xref>). Thus, re-uptaken NA by NAT may largely be degraded to DOPEGAL by the increased activity of MAO-A. Subsequently, DOPEGAL converts pro-AEP into active-AEP to produce tau N368 protein (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5G-I</xref>).</p>
<p>It has never been addressed how DOPEGAL production was caused in the cell body of LC neurons while the DOPEGAL production in the cell bodies of LC neurons is well established in AD patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Burke et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Kang et al., 2020</xref>) and in transgenic AD model mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Kang et al., 2020</xref>). We demonstrated for the first time that 5-day RS can impair the autoinhibition by causing the internalization of α2A-AR and consequently induces active-AEP to produce tau N368 fragment. Indeed, 5-day RS induced spatial memory impairment-like responses in mice when assessed using Y-maze test (Figure supplement 9) while anxiety-like behavior was also induced in mice after 3-day RS when assessed using an elevated plus maze test (figure not shown), both suggesting an impairment of LC neurons. It is likely that, in addition to NAT inhibitor, the suppression of the internalization of α2A-AR has a strong translational potential for developing drugs that prevent the degeneration of LC.</p>

<title>Limitations of this study</title>
<p>One may argue against the usage of 3-week-old juvenile mice to study the neurodegenerative disorder which is normally found in aged ones. However, a stringent autoinhibition together with potent NAT activity were previously demonstrated in adult rats using intracellular recordings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Williams et al., 1985</xref>). Thus, regardless of the age of mice, LC neurons showed the autoinhibition that is mediated by the activity of α2A-AR-coupled GIRK channels. We also confirmed that spike-frequency adaptation reflecting autoinhibition can be induced in adult mice as prominently as in juvenile mice regardless of sexes (Figure supplement 10), although we did not investigate the sex differences in RS effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Leistner and Menke, 2020</xref>). The downregulation of autoinhibition by the internalization of α2A-AR is agonist- and Ca<sup>2+</sup>- dependent regardless of the age of mice. However, it is not known if there is any difference in the susceptibility of α2A-AR internalization to RS between juvenile and aged mice. Thus, a further study may be necessary to examine if autoinhibition in LC neurons is more easily downregulated in aged mice compared to juvenile ones.</p>
<p>It has also been reported that re-uptake of NA by NAT in LC neurons may decrease with age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Sanders et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Mitchell et al., 2017</xref>). However, NAT expression in LC in 3- week-old juvenile mice was only slightly larger (by 4%) than in adult mice although the difference was significant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Mitchell et al., 2017</xref>). Potent NAT activity stringently affecting autoinhibition was reported in adult rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Williams et al., 1985</xref>). Furthermore, partial inhibition of NAT in human subjects largely reduced the original level of a derivative of DOPEGAL in CSF as described above. Thus, based on the present study, it is likely that increased re-uptake of NA by NAT following excessive NA-autocrine in the absence of α2A-AR, induced in response to chronic RS, resulted in the increase in active-AEP and subsequent production of tau N368. However, a further experiment to directly assess NAT activity would be necessary to firmly justify our hypothesis.</p>
<p>To further validate the mechanisms which we have proposed in the present study (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>), direct quantification of the relationship between α2A-AR internalization and increased cytosolic NA levels may be desirable. However, at present, the quantification of such connection may not be possible because there appears to be no fluorescence probe to label cytosolic NA. None of NA fluorescence probes, such as NS521, BPS3 or GRAB-NE, is applicable to detect cytosolic free NA because NS521 and BPS3 anchor on plasma membrane and GRAB-NE is dependent on GPCR activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Hettie and Glass, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Feng et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Mao et al., 2023</xref>).</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Our study unveiled the cellular mechanism for the degeneration of LC neurons under chronic RS as follows: Chronic RS impaired the autoinhibition in LC neurons by inducing Ca<sup>2+</sup>- and agonist-dependent internalization of soma/dendritic α2A-AR coupled with GIRK channels. This subsequently caused overexcitation/[Ca<sup>2+</sup>]i increases and increased Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent MAO-A activity and active AEP activity, leading to a production of tau N368 fragment together with an impairment of spatial memory. These results clearly indicate that chronic RS increases cytosolic free NA to be metabolized by MAO-A, presumably by facilitating the re- uptake of autocrine-released NA due to the absence/internalization of α2A-AR. Thus, in addition to NAT inhibitor, the suppression of α2A-AR internalization may have a strong translational potential for developing drugs that prevent the degeneration of LC. However, the present mechanism must be proven to be valid in adult or old mice, to validate its involvement in the pathogenesis of anxiety/AD.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="s6a">
<title>Restraint stress</title>
<p>Three-weeks-old male C57BL/6 mice (JAPAN HAMAMATSU SLC, Hamamatsu, Japan) were used and housed at 24 ± 2°C. Food and water were available ad libitum. The mice in the stressed groups were restrained in a modified 50 ml clear polystyrene conical centrifuge with multiple air holes for ventilation. The mice were subjected to 12-h restraint stress (RS; 20:00 p.m. to 8:00 a.m. of the next day) for 1, 2, 3 and 5 days. In the previous study, the duration of RS widely ranged from 0.5-h (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Gray et al., 2010</xref>) to 24-h (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Chu et al., 2016</xref>) while the RS with the duration less than 12-h has been applied daily for a period (6-h for 2 weeks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Sakaguchi and Nakamura, 1990</xref>]; 8-h for up to 16 weeks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Sugama et al., 2016</xref>]; 12-h for 2 days [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Zhang et al., 2008</xref>]). As the prolonged stress is known to be a potential risk factor for AD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Bisht et al., 2018</xref>), the protocol of daily 12-h RS is relevant for the study of functional and cytological disorders of LC neurons. Once the restraint ended, the mice were returned to their home cages with access to food and water ad libitum. The control group remained in their home cages without the restraint procedure.</p>

<title>Slice preparation and electrophysiological recordings</title>
<p>Slices were prepared from 3-weeks-old male C57BL/6 mice to investigate the effects of RS for varying periods on GIRK-I, and from C57BL/6 mice of either sex at 16–23 postnatal days (PD) to investigate the effects of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]i increases on GIRK-I, similar to our previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Toyoda et al., 2022</xref>). Using an Axopatch 200B (MDS Analytical Technologies, Sunnyvale, CA), whole-cell recordings were made from LC neurons that were viewed under Nomarski optics (BX51WI; Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). LC neurons were identified immunohistochemically and electrophysiologically as we previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Toyoda et al., 2022</xref>). The internal solution of the patch pipettes had the following ionic composition (in mM): 123 K-gluconate, 18 KCl, 10 NaCl, 2 MgCl2, 2 ATP-Na2, 0.3 GTP-Na3, 10 HEPES, and 0.2 EGTA; pH 7.3. The membrane potential values given in the text were corrected for the junction potential (10 mV) between the internal solution for the whole-cell recording (negative) and the standard extracellular solution. The pipette resistances were 4–6 MΩ. The series resistance was &lt; 10 MΩ. All recordings were made at room temperature (RT). Records of currents and voltages were low-pass filtered at 5 kHz (3-pole Bessel filter), digitized at a sampling rate of 10 kHz (Digidata 1322A, MDS Analytical Technologies) and stored on a computer hard disk. Spike- frequency adaptation was quantitatively estimated by fitting with a saturation curve defined by Monod equation (y = (<bold><italic>a</italic></bold> * x) / (<bold><italic>b</italic></bold> + x)) with a saturation level (<bold><italic>a</italic></bold>) and a half saturation constant (<bold><italic>b</italic></bold>).

<title>Procedure for immunohistochemical examination</title>
<p>C57BL6/J male mice (4-5 weeks) were perfused transcardially with 5 ml of PBS, followed by 10 ml of a freshly prepared 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS. The whole brain including LC (–9 to –10 mm from bregma) was dissected out and immersed in 4% paraformaldehyde solution for 4 h at 4°C fallowed by cryoprotection with 30% (w/w) sucrose in PBS.</p>
<p>Brainstem including LC regions was cut into 8-20 μm-thickness coronal sections on a freezing microtome (Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany). To examine the distribution of α2A-AR in LC neurons, mouse anti-TH (1:500; sc-25269, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA), rabbit anti-sodium potassium ATPase (1:1000; ab76020, Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA) and goat anti-α2A-AR (1:200; ab45871, Abcam) or rabbit anti-α2A-AR (1:500; RA14110, Neuromics, Northfield, MN, USA) were used as primary antibodies, while cy5 donkey anti-mouse IgG (1:500; cy-2500, Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA), FITC donkey anti-rabbit IgG (1:500; 711-095-152, Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA, USA) and Cy3 donkey anti-goat IgG (1:500; 706-165-147, Jackson ImmunoResearch) were used as secondary antibodies. We used the affinity purified IgG antibody for α2A-AR immunohistochemistry, in which antibody specificity was ensured as examined previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Stone et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Tan et al., 2009</xref>).

To examine the distribution of legumain in LC neurons, mouse anti-legumain (1:200; sc-133234, Santa Cruz) and rabbit anti-DBH (1:500; 22806, ImmunoStar, Hudson, WI, USA) were used as primary antibodies, while FITC donkey anti-mouse IgG (1:500; 715-545-150, Jackson ImmunoResearch) and Cy3 donkey anti- rabbit IgG (1:500; 711-165-152, Jackson ImmunoResearch) were used as secondary antibodies.

<title>Western blot study</title>
<p>Brain slices from the control and 5-day RS-treated mice were sectioned with vibratome (VT1000P, (Leica Microsystems) to obtain 500 μm-thickness coronal sections containing LC region (bregma –5.34 mm to –5.80 mm). We performed Western blot study only in 5-day RS mice without examining in 3-day RS mice, under the assumption that for the degeneration- related biochemical changes to reach sufficiently detectable levels, a high [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]i condition due to the rundown of GIRK-I have to be sustained for some period of time after the rundown of GIRK-I reached a plateau level in 3-day RS mice (see <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>, G). LC dissection was done via micro punch using 1.5 mm biopsy punch (BP-15F, Kai medical, Gifu, Japan) bilaterally under light microscope. Dissected LC were quickly frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°C until processed. Because LC region was too small to collect sufficient tissue from one mouse for the analysis, the punched LC tissues were collected from two to three mice to obtain a protein lysate sample for each Western blotting analysis. LC tissues were homogenized by bead homogenizer in T-PER™ Tissue Protein Extraction Reagent (78510, Thermo Fisher) containing protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktails (MilliporeSigma, St. Louis, MO, USA). The membrane and cytosol proteins from LC lysate were isolated using Mem-PER Plus Kit (78840, Thermo Fisher) in accordance with the manufacture’s protocol. The protein concentration of the lysate was determined using a Lowry protein assay (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). Protein samples (20 µg) were heated to 95°C for 5 min, separated by 12% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and transferred to a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane using a Transblot SD apparatus (Bio-Rad). After the blots had been washed with tris-buffered saline containing Tween-20 (TBST, 10 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 0.05% Tween-20), the membranes were blocked with 2% BSA and 4% skim milk/TBST at RT for 1 h and incubated at 4°C overnight with primary antibodies, followed by an anti-rabbit IgG horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary antibody (1:5,000, 7074; Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, USA) at RT for 1 h. The Western blot membrane was stripped the primary and secondary antibodies and reprobed with the anti-β-actin antibody followed by the anti-rabbit IgG HRP-conjugated secondary antibody. The following primary antibodies were used for the blots: rabbit anti-α2A-AR (1:500; AAR020, alomone), rabbit anti-GAPDH (1:1000; LF-PA0018, Abfrontier, Seoul, Korea), mouse anti-beta actin (1:2000, A5441, MilliporeSigma) and rabbit anti-sodium potassium ATPase (1:1000; ab76020, Abchem) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref><bold>, F and G</bold>); rabbit anti-TH (1:1600; GTX113016, GeneTex, Irvine, CA, USA), rabbit anti-MAO-A (1:6400; ab126751, Abcam), mouse anti-legumain (AEP) (1:400; sc- 133234, Santa Cruz), mouse anti-TAU-5 (1:1500, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, SC-58860) and mouse anti-beta actin (1:12800, 66009-1-Ig, Proteintec, Rosemont, IL, USA) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref><bold>, D and G</bold>); rabbit anti-tau AEP-cleaved (N368) (1:5000, ABN1703, MilliporeSigma) and mouse anti-beta actin (1:1000, A5441, MilliporeSigma) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5G, I</xref>).

<title>Quantitative real-time PCR</title>
<p>cDNA was synthesized with Super Script II Reverse Transcriptase (18064, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) with 1 mg of LC neuron RNA. Using a 7300 Gene Amp PCR system (Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad), quantitative real-time PCR was run in Power SYBR Green PCR master mix (4367656; Life Technologies, Carlsbad) under the following thermal cycling conditions; an initial step of 94°C/5 min, followed by 40 cycles of a series of steps of 94°C/45 s, 61°C/45 s, 72°C/45 s and ended with a series of steps of 95°C/60 s, 60°C/1 min, 95°C/15 s, 60°C/15 s. The following primers were used: α2A (forward GGAATCATGGCTGTGGAGAT, reverse CAGAAATCCCTTCCCTGTCA); α2C (forward TCATCGTTTTCACCGTGGTA, reverse GCTCATTGGCCAGAGAAAAG); GIRK1 (forward ACCCTGGTGGATCTCAAGTG, reverse GGCCACACAGGGAGTGTAGT); GRIK2 (forward CAACCTCAACGGGTTTGTCT, reverse ATCCTACCATGAAGGCGTTG); GIRK3 (forward CGTCTCACCTCTCGTCATCA, reverse CATCCACCAGGTACGAGCTT); GAPDH (forward CCAGAACATCATCCCTGCAT, reverse GCATCGAAGGTGGAAGAGTG).</p>

<title>Behavioral test</title>
<p>The control mice as non-stress group and mice exposed to RS for 1 day, 3 days and 5 days as 1-day, 3-day and 5-day RS groups were tested on the Y maze apparatus, consisted of three identical arms in a “Y” shape made of white acryl (35 cm in length, 5 cm in width, and 20 cm in height) to assess working spatial memory. All tests were performed between 9 AM and noon. Investigators were blinded to the group when performing experiments. Each mouse was placed at the extremity of the “start arm” and left for a training session of 15 minutes, with one of the 2 other arms closed with a white acrylic board (the closed arm was randomly chosen for each mouse). Then, the mouse was brought back to its cage for 5 minutes, the maze was cleaned, the closed arm was opened, and the mouse placed at the extremity of the start arm for a 5-minute test session, under video tracking. The time spent and distance traveled in each arm (start, familiar, and novel arms) were measured and analyzed with Smart 3.0 video tracking software (Panlab, Harvard Apparatus, Holliston, MA, USA). Given their natural curiosity, mice are expected to spend more time exploring the new arm.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This manuscript investigates the mechanism by which chronic stress induces degeneration of locus coeruleus (LC) neurons. The authors demonstrate that chronic stress leads to the internalization of α2A-adrenergic receptors (α2A-ARs) on LC neurons, causing increased cytosolic noradrenaline (NA) accumulation and subsequent production of the neurotoxic metabolite DOPEGAL via monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A). The study suggests a mechanistic link between stress-induced α2A-AR internalization, disrupted autoinhibition, elevated NA metabolism, activation of asparagine endopeptidase (AEP), and Tau pathology relevant to Alzheimer's disease (AD). The conclusions of this paper are well-supported mainly by the data, but some aspects of image acquisition require further examination.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This study clearly demonstrates the effects of chronic stimulation on the excitability of LC neurons using electrophysiological techniques. It also elucidates the role of α2-adrenergic receptor (α2-AR) internalization and the associated upstream and downstream signaling pathways of GIRK-1, using a range of pharmacological agents, highlighting the innovative nature of the work. Additionally, the study identifies the involvement of the MAO-A-DOPEGAL-AEP pathway in this process. The topic is timely, the proposed mechanistic pathway is compelling, and the findings have translational relevance, particularly in relation to therapeutic strategies targeting α2A-AR internalization in neurodegenerative diseases.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) The manuscript reports that chronic stress for 5 days increases MAO-A levels in LC neurons, leading to the production of DOPEGAL, activation of AEP, and subsequent tau cleavage into the tau N368 fragment, ultimately contributing to neuronal damage. However, the authors used wild-type C57BL/6 mice, and previous literature has indicated that AEP-mediated tau cleavage in wild-type mice is minimal and generally insufficient to cause significant behavioral alterations. Please clarify and discuss this apparent discrepancy.</p>
<p>(2) It is recommended that the authors include additional experiments to examine the effects of different durations and intensities of stress on MAO-A expression and AEP activity. This would strengthen the understanding of stress-induced biochemical changes and their thresholds.</p>
<p>(3) Please clarify the rationale for the inconsistent stress durations used across Figures 3, 4, and 5. In some cases, a 3-day stress protocol is used, while in others, a 5-day protocol is applied. This discrepancy should be addressed to ensure clarity and experimental consistency.</p>
<p>(4) The abbreviation &quot;vMAT2&quot; is incorrectly formatted. It should be &quot;VMAT2,&quot; and the full name (vesicular monoamine transporter 2) should be provided at first mention.</p>
<p>Comments on revisions:</p>
<p>The authors have addressed all of the reviewers' comments.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors present a technically impressive dataset showing that repeated excitation or restraint stress internalises somatodendritic α2A adrenergic autoreceptors (α2A ARs) in locus coeruleus (LC) neurons. Loss of these receptors weakens GIRK-dependent autoinhibition, raises neuronal excitability, and is accompanied by higher MAO A, DOPEGAL, AEP, and tau N368 levels. The work combines rigorous whole-cell electrophysiology with barbadin-based trafficking assays, qPCR, Western blotting, and immunohistochemistry. The final schematic is appealing and, in principle, could explain early LC hyperactivity followed by degeneration in ageing and Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>- Multi-level approach - The study integrates electrophysiology, pharmacology, mRNA quantification, and protein-level analysis.</p>
<p>-Use of barbadin to block β-arrestin/AP-2-dependent internalisation is both technically precise and mechanistically informative</p>
<p>-Well-executed electrophysiology</p>
<p>-translation relevance</p>
<p>-converges to a model that peers discussed (scientists can only discuss models - not data!)</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the manuscript currently reads as a sequence of discrete experiments rather than a single causal chain.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the previous reviews</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer # 1 (Public review)</bold></p>
<p>This study aims to elucidate the mechanisms by which stress-induced α2A-adrenergic receptor (α2A-AR) internalization leads to cytosolic noradrenaline (NA) accumulation and subsequent neuronal dysfunction in the locus coeruleus (LC). While the manuscript presents an interesting but ambitious model involving calcium dynamics, GIRK channel rundown, and autocrine NA signaling, several key limitations undermine the strength of the conclusions.</p>
<p>(1) First, the revision does not include new experiments requested by reviewers to validate core aspects of the mechanism. Specifically, there is no direct measurement of cytosolic NA levels or MAO-A enzymatic activity to support the link between receptor internalization and neurochemical changes. The authors argue that such measurements are either not feasible or beyond the scope of the study, leaving a significant gap in the mechanistic chain of evidence.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Although the reviewer #1 commented that “The authors argue that such measurements are either not feasible or beyond the scope of the study, leaving a significant gap in the mechanistic chain of evidence”, we believe that this comment may be unfair.</p>
<p>It may be unfair for the reviewer #1 to neglect our responses to the original reviewer comments regarding the direct measurement of cytosolic NA levels. It is true that none of the recommended methods to directly measure cytosolic NA levels are not feasible as described in the original authors’ response (see the original authors’ response to the comment raised by the Reviewer #1 as Recommendations for the authors (2)). To measure extracellular NA with GRAB-NE photometry, α2A-ARs must be expressed in the cell membrane. GRAB-NE photometry is not applicable unless α2A-ARs are expressed, whereas increases in cytosolic NA levels are caused by internalization of α2A-ARs in our study.</p>
<p>In our study, we elaborated to detect the change in MAO-A protein with Western blot method, instead of examining MAO-A enzymatic activity. Because the relative quantification of active AEP and Tau N368 proteins by Western blot analysis should accurately reflect the change in the MAO-A enzymatic activity, enzymatic assay may not be necessarily required while we admit the necessity of enzymatic assay to better demonstrate the MAO-A activities as discussed in the previously revised manuscript (R1, page 10, lines 314-315).</p>
<p>We used the phrase “beyond the scope of the current study” for “the mechanism how Ca<sup>2+</sup> activates MAO-A” as described in the original authors’ responses (see the original authors’ response to the comment raised by the Reviewer #1 as Weakness (3)). We do not think that this mechanism must be investigated in the present study because the Ca<sup>2+</sup> dependent nature of MAO-A activity is already known (Cao et al., 2007).</p>
<p>On the other hand, because it is not possible to measure cytosolic NA levels with currently available methods, the quantification of the connection between α2A-AR internalization and increased cytosolic NA levels must be considered outside the scope of the study. However, our study demonstrated the qualitative relationship between α2A-AR internalization and active-AEP/TauN-368 reflecting increased cytosolic NA levels, leaving “a small gap in the mechanistic chain of evidence.” Therefore, it may be unreasonable to criticize our study as “leaving a significant gap in the mechanistic chain of evidence” with the phrase “beyond the scope of the current study.”</p>

<p>(2) Second, the behavioral analysis remains insufficient to support claims of cognitive impairment. The use of a single working memory test following an anxiety test is inadequate to verify memory dysfunction behaviors. Additional cognitive assays, such as the Morris Water Maze or Novel Object Recognition, are recommended but not performed.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As described in the original authors’ response (see the original authors’ response to the comment raised by the Reviewer #1 as Weakness (4)), we had already done another behavioral test using elevated plus maze (EPM) test. By combining the two tests, it may be possible to more accurately evaluate the results of Y-maze test by differentiating the memory impairment from anxiety. However, the results obtained by these behavioral tests showed that chronic RS mice displayed both anxiety-like and memory impairment-like behaviors. Accordingly, we have softened the implication of anxiety and memory impairment (page 13, lines 396-399) and revised the abstract (page 2, line 59) in the revised manuscript (R2).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) Third, concerns regarding the lack of rigor in differential MAO-A expression in fluorescence imaging were not addressed experimentally. Instead of clarifying the issue, the authors moved the figure to supplementary data without providing further evidence (e.g., an enzymatic assay or quantitative reanalysis of Western blot, or re-staining of IF for MAO-A) to support their interpretation.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Because the quantification of MAO-A expression can be performed with greater accuracy by means of Western blot than by immunohistochemistry, we have moved the immunohistochemical results (shown in Figure 5) to the supplemental data (Figure S8) following the suggestion made by the Reviewer #3. As the relative quantification of active AEP and Tau N368 proteins by Western blot analysis may accurately reflect changes in the MAO-A enzymatic activity which is consistent with the result of Western blot analysis of MAO-A, enzymatic assay or re-staining of immunofluorescence for MAO-A may not be necessarily required. We do not think that a new experiment of Western blot analysis is necessary to re-evaluate MAO-A just because of the lack of the less-reliable quantification of immunohistochemical staining.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) Fourth, concerns regarding TH staining remain unresolved. In Figure S7, the α2A-AR signal appears to resemble TH staining, and vice versa, raising the possibility of labeling errors. It is recommended that the authors re-examine this issue by either double-checking the raw data or repeating the immunostaining to validate the staining.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The reviewer #3 is misunderstanding Figure S7. In Figure S7, there are two types of α2A-AR expressing neurons; one is TH-positive LC neuron and the other is TH-negative neuron in mesencephalic trigeminal nucleus (MTN). This clearly indicates that TH staining is specific. Furthermore, α2A-AR staining was much more extensive in MTN neurons than in LC neurons. Thus, α2A-AR signal is not similar to TH signal and there are no labeling errors, which is also evident in the merged image (Figure S7C).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) Overall, the manuscript offers a potentially interesting framework but falls short in providing the experimental rigor necessary to establish causality. The reliance on indirect reasoning and reorganizing of existing data, rather than generating new evidence, limits the overall impact and interpretability of the study.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Overall, the reviewer #1 was not satisfied with our revision regardless of the authors’ responses. As detailed above in our responses to the replies (1)~(4), we believe that in the original authors’ responses and in the above-described responses we effectively responded to the criticisms by the reviewer #1.</p>

<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the manuscript currently reads as a sequence of discrete experiments rather than a single causal chain. Below, I outline the key points that should be addressed to make the model convincing.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p>
<p>(1) Causality across the pathway</p>
<p>Each step (α2A internalisation, GIRK rundown, Ca<sup>2+</sup> rise, MAO-A/AEP upregulation) is demonstrated separately, but no experiment links them in a single preparation. Consider in vivo Ca<sup>2+</sup> or GRAB NE photometry during restraint stress while probing α2A levels with i.p. clonidine injection or optogenetic over excitation coupled to biochemical readouts. Such integrated evidence would help to overcome the correlational nature of the manuscript to a more mechanistic study.</p>
<p>Authors response: It is not possible to measure free cytosolic NA levels with GRAB NE photometry when α2A AR is internalized as described above (see the response to the comment made by reviewer #1 as the recommendation for the authors).</p>
<p>The core idea behind my comment, as well as that of Reviewer 1, was to encourage integrating your individual findings into a more cohesive in vivo experiment. Using GRAB-NE to measure extracellular NA could serve as an indirect readout of NA uptake via NAT, and ultimately, cytosolic NA levels. Connecting these experiments would significantly strengthen the manuscript and enhance its overall impact.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>It may be true that the measurement of extracellular NA could serve as an indirect readout of NA uptake via NAT, and ultimately cytosolic NA levels. However, the reviewer #3 is still misunderstanding the applicability of GRAB-NE method to detect NE in our study. As described in the original authors’ response, there appeared to be no fluorescence probe to label cytosolic NA at present. Especially, the GRAB-NE method recommended by the reviewers #1 and #3 is limited to detect NA only when α2A-AR is expressed in the cell membrane.Therefore, when increases in cytosolic NA levels are caused by internalization of α2A-ARs, NA measurement with GRAB-NE photometry is not applicable.</p>

<p>(2) Pharmacology and NE concentration</p>
<p>The use of 100 µM noradrenaline saturates α and β adrenergic receptors alike. Please provide ramp measurements of GIRK current in dose-response at 1-10 µM NE (blocked by atipamezole) to confirm that the rundown really reflects α2A activity rather than mixed receptor effects.</p>
<p>Authors response: It is true that 100 µM noradrenaline activates both α and β adrenergic receptors alike. However, it was clearly showed that enhancement of GIRK-I by 100 µM noradrenaline was completely antagonized by 10 µM atipamezole and the Ca<sup>2+</sup> dependent rundown of NA-induced GIRK-I was prevented by 10 µM atipamezole. Considering the Ki values of atipamezole for α2A AR (=1~3 nM) (Vacher et al., 2010, J Med Chem) and β AR (&gt;10 µM) (Virtanen et al., 1989, Arch Int Pharmacodyn Ther), these results really reflect α2A AR activity but not β AR activity (Figure S5). Furthermore, because it is already well established that NA-induced GIRK-I was mediated by α2A AR activity in LC neurons (Arima et al., 1998, J Physiol; Williams et al., 1985, Neuroscience), it is not necessarily need to re-examine 1-10 µM NA on GIRK-I.</p>
<p>While the milestone papers by Williams remain highly influential, they should be re-evaluated in light of more recent findings, given that they date back over 40 years. Advances in our understanding now allow for a more nuanced interpretation of some of their results. For example, see McKinney et al. (eLife, 2023). This study demonstrates that presynaptic β-adrenergic receptors-particularly β2-can enhance neuronal excitability via autocrine mechanisms. This suggests that your post-activation experiments using atipamezole may not fully exclude a contribution of β-adrenergic signaling. Such a role might become apparent when conducting more detailed titration experiments.</p>

<p>The reviewer #3 may be misunderstanding the report by McKinney et al. (eLife, 2013). This paper did not demonstrate that presynaptic β-adrenergic receptors-particularly β2- can enhance neuronal excitability via autocrine mechanisms. It is impossible for LC neurons to increase their excitability by activating β-adrenergic receptors, as we have clearly shown that enhancement of GIRK-I by 100 µM noradrenaline was completely antagonized by 10 µM atipamezole. Considering the difference in Ki values of atipamezole for α2-AR (= 2~4 nM) (Vacher et al., 2010, J Med Chem) and β-AR (&gt;10 µM) (Virtanen et al., 1989, Arch Int Pharmacodyn Ther), such a complete antagonization (of 100 µM NA-induced GIRK-I) by 10 µM atipamezole really reflect α2A-AR activity but not β-AR activity (Figure S5). Furthermore, it is already well established that NA-induced GIRK-I was mediated by α2-AR activity in LC neurons (Arima et al., 1998, J Physiol). McKinney et al. (eLife, 2023) have just found the absence of lateral inhibition on adjacent LC neurons by NA autocrine caused respective spike activity. This has nothing to do with autoinhibition.</p>

<p>(4) Age mismatch and disease claims</p>
<p>All electrophysiology and biochemical data come from juvenile (&lt; P30) mice, yet the conclusions stress Alzheimer-related degeneration. Key endpoints need to be replicated in adult or aged mice, or the manuscript should soften its neurodegenerative scope.</p>
<p>Authors response: As described in the section of Conclusion, we never stress Alzheimer-related degeneration, but might give such an impression. To avoid such a misunderstanding, we have added a description “However, the present mechanism must be proven to be valid in adult or old mice, to validate its involvement in the pathogenesis of AD.” (R1, page 14, lines 448-450).</p>
<p>It would be great to see this experiment performed in aged mice-you are the one who has everything in place to do it right now!</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In our future separate studies, we would like to prove that the present mechanism is valid in aged mice, to validate its involvement in the pathogenesis of AD. This is partly because the patch-clamp study in aged mice is extremely difficult and takes much time.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Authors response: In the abstract, you suggest that internalization of α2A-adrenergic receptors could represent a therapeutic target for Alzheimer's disease. &quot;...Thus, it is likely that internalization of α2A-AR increased cytosolic NA, as reflected in AEP increases, by facilitating reuptake of autocrine-released NA. The suppression of α2A-AR internalization may have a translational potential for AD treatment.&quot;</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>α2A-AR internalization was involved in the degeneration of LC neurons. Because we confirmed that spike-frequency adaptation reflecting α2A-AR-mediated autoinhibition can be induced in adult mice as prominently as in juvenile mice (Figure S10), it is not inadequate to suggest that the suppression of α2A-AR internalization may have a translational potential for anxiety/AD treatment (see Discussion; R2, page 14, lines 445-449).</p>

<p>(6) Quantitative histology</p>
<p>Figure 5 presents attractive images, but no numerical analysis is provided. Please provide ROI-based fluorescence quantification (with n values) or move the images to the supplement and rely on the Western blots.</p>
<p>Author response: We have moved the immunohistochemical results in Fig. 5 to the supplement, as we believe the quantification of immunohistochemical staining is not necessarily correct.</p>
<p>What do you mean by that &quot; ...immunohistochemical staining is not necessarily correct.&quot;</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>It is evident that in terms of quantification, Western blot analysis is a more accurate method than immunohistochemical staining. In this sense, it is the contention of our study that the ROI-based fluorescence quantification of immunohistochemical staining is not necessarily an accurate or correct procedure, compared to the quantification by Western blot analysis.</p>
