<abstract>
<p>Light reaction of photosynthesis is one of the most important reactions for sustaining our environment. Photosystem II (PSII) is the initial site of photosynthetic electron transfer by water oxidation. Light in excess, however, causes the simultaneous production of singlet oxygen, a potent reactive oxygen species (ROS), leading to photo-oxidative damage in PSII. To maintain photosynthetic activity, the PSII reaction center protein D1, which is the primary target of unavoidable photo-oxidative damage, is efficiently degraded by FtsH protease. In PSII subunits, photo-oxidative modifications of several amino acids such as Trp have been indeed documented, whereas the linkage between such modifications and D1 degradation remains elusive. Here, we show that an oxidative post-translational modification of Trp residue at the N-terminal tail of D1 is correlated with D1 degradation by FtsH during high-light stress. We revealed that <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> mutant lacking FtsH2 had increased levels of oxidative Trp residues in D1, among which an N-terminal Trp-14 was distinctively localized in the stromal side. Further characterization of Trp-14 using chloroplast transformation in <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> indicated that substitution of D1 Trp-14 to Phe, mimicking Trp oxidation enhanced FtsH-mediated D1 degradation under high light, although the substitution did not affect protein stability and PSII activity. Molecular dynamics simulation of PSII implies that both Trp-14 oxidation and Phe substitution cause fluctuation of D1 N-terminal tail. Furthermore, Trp-14 to Phe modification appeared to have an additive effect in the interaction between FtsH and PSII core in vivo. Together, our results suggest that the Trp oxidation at its N-terminus of D1 may be one of the key oxidations in the PSII repair, leading to processive degradation by FtsH.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Light energy is essential for photosynthesis, which sustains our environment on Earth by generating oxygen and chemical energy for carbon fixation. The first step of photosynthetic electron transfer in the thylakoid membrane occurs at Photosystem II (PSII), where light energy absorbed by P<sub>680</sub> chlorophyll molecules drives water oxidation, and electron is transferred to plastoquinone. PSII core complex is formed by two reaction center proteins D1 (PsbA) and D2 (PsbD), along with intrinsic antenna CP43 (PsbC) and CP47 (PsbB). Despite its orchestrated coordination, however, light energy is known to cause photooxidative damage in PSII, especially reaction center protein D1, with singlet oxygen. Photo-damaged D1 needs to be degraded to replace it with a newly synthesized one, known as the PSII repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Lindahl, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bailey et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Silva et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Kato et al., 2009</xref>). When photooxidative damage in PSII exceeds the capacity of PSII repair, it ultimately leads to the status called ‘photoinhibition’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Aro et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Murata et al., 2007</xref>). PSII repair proceeds with the following steps, i) oxidative damage to D1 protein in the PSII complex, ii) migration of photo-damaged PSII laterally from grana stacks to non-appressed regions of thylakoid membranes, iii) detachment of CP43 from photo-damaged PSII allows for access of protease degrading damaged D1, and iv) concomitant D1 synthesis and reassembly of PSII into grana thylakoid. Substantial efforts to understand the mechanisms of PSII repair suggest that reversible phosphorylation of PSII core subunits is involved in fine-tuning the photo-damaged D1 turnover (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Baena-González et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Fristedt et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Kato and Sakamoto, 2014</xref>). On the other hand, other critical steps, CP43 disassembly and the recognition of photooxidative damage in PSII for selective D1 degradation, remain to be elucidated.</p>
<p>Our previous studies along with those from other groups have shown that the fundamental D1 degradation in PSII repair is performed by FtsH, a membrane-bound ATP-dependent zinc metalloprotease that degrades membrane proteins in a processive manner, although several Deg proteases seem to facilitate the effective degradation by creating additional recognition sites for FtsH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Lindahl, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bailey et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Sakamoto, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Silva et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Kato et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Kato and Sakamoto, 2014</xref>). Their family proteins are universally conserved in prokaryotes and eukaryotic organelles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Hanna Janska, Malgorzata Kwasniaka, 2013</xref>). Photosynthetic organisms have hetero-hexameric FtsH complex in the thylakoid membrane, which is composed of type A and type B subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Kato and Sakamoto, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Yi et al., 2022</xref>). In the thylakoid membrane of <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>, for example, FtsH1 or FtsH5 (type A) and FtsH2 or FtsH8 (type B) form functional FtsH complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Yu et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Yu et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Zaltsman et al., 2005</xref>). <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> mutants lacking FtsH5 or FtsH2 are, though viable, highly vulnerable to PSII photodamage under high light and are named <italic>yellow variegated1</italic> (<italic>var1</italic>) and <italic>var2</italic> from the characteristic variegated phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Chen et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Takechi et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Sakamoto et al., 2002</xref>). This variegated phenotype implies that FtsH is required for proper protein quality control during proplastid-to-chloroplast differentiation in seed plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Miura et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Sakamoto et al., 2009</xref>). Similarly, the FtsH complex in the thylakoid membranes of <italic>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</italic> consists of FtsH1 (type A) and FtsH2 (type B) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Malnoe et al., 2014</xref>). <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> studies revealed that FtsH is also involved in the degradation of cytochrome <italic>b<sub>6</sub>f</italic> complex and light-harvesting antenna of photosystem I (PSI) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Malnoe et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Bujaldon et al., 2017</xref>). Furthermore, recent studies suggest that increased turnover of FtsH by itself, which is compensated by upregulated gene expression, is crucial for their function under high-light stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Wang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Kato et al., 2018</xref>).</p>
<p>In <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, FtsH was shown to recognize either N- or C-terminal tail of membrane protein substrates to dislocate their substrates into the protease chamber (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Ito and Akiyama, 2005</xref>). Similarly, the fact that both D1’s N-terminal end and the catalytic site of FtsH are exposed to the stromal side implies D1 to be recognized by FtsH from its N-terminus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Umena et al., 2011</xref>). Supporting this, processive degradation of D1 by FtsH was shown to be attenuated by the loss of N-terminal tail of D1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Komenda et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Michoux et al., 2016</xref>). While these observations suggest involvement of the N-terminal region in D1, whether D1 undergoes oxidative modification at its N-terminal region has not been investigated.</p>
<p>What is the consequence of photoinhibition leading to photo-oxidative damage in PSII? Light energy frequently leads to the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as singlet oxygen at around PSII (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Ohnishi et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Tyystjärvi, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Yamamoto et al., 2008</xref>), which may cause oxidative post-translational modification (OPTM) of subunit proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Li and Kim, 2022</xref>). It is noteworthy that light-dependent oxidation of amino acids, either in free forms or as peptide residues, has been reported, including thiol-containing (Cys and Met) and aromatic (Tyr, Phe, Trp) amino acids. For example, Cys and Met are prone to oxidation, whereas the oxidized Cys and Met can be reduced enzymatically. In contrast to these reversible OPTMs, OPTM of Trp is irreversible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Rinalducci et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Ehrenshaft et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, the only way to remove irreversible oxidized residues is proteolytic degradation, implying that Trp oxidation might trigger D1 degradation, either directly or indirectly in the PSII repair. As summarized in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>, oxidation of Trp side chain results in the formation of oxindolylalanine (OIA), N-formylkyrnurenine (NFK), and kynurenine (KYN). ROS, such as singlet oxygen, attacks and opens the pyrrole ring of Trp, and forms a di-oxidized Trp derivative, NFK. Indeed, Trp residues in photosynthetic protein components were shown to be oxidized both in vitro and in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Anderson et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Dreaden et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Dreaden Kasson et al., 2012</xref>). However, although oxidative modification of D1 and other subunits has been documented previously, how these molecules are recognized and undergo degradation remains elusive. In this study, we investigated whether Trp oxidation in PSII core proteins influences D1 degradation mediated by FtsH. Our integrative approaches to address this question, by mass-spectrometry, site-directed mutagenesis, D1 degradation assay, and simulation model suggest that an N-terminal Trp oxidation is likely to be a key OPTM to trigger D1 degradation in the PSII repair.</p>

<title>Increased OPTM of Trp residues in <italic>Arabidopsis var2</italic> mutant</title>
<p>Previous studies using isolated spinach thylakoid membranes and <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> seedlings revealed several Trp residues oxidized in PSII core proteins, as summarized (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.1b</xref> and Supplementary Table S1)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Rinalducci et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Dreaden et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Dreaden Kasson et al., 2012</xref>). Trp-oxidized derivatives, OIA, NFK, and KYN, give the shifts of peptide mass to + 16, + 32, and + 4 Da, respectively (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.1a</xref>, <xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1</xref> and <xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">S2</xref>). In this study, we attempted to assess if the oxidation of certain Trp residues is associated with D1 degradation in the PSII repair cycle. To investigate this, comprehensive detection of Trp oxidation within protein extracts in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> has been established using label-free quantitative mass-spectrometry, as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Dogra et al., 2019</xref>). First, we characterized Trp oxidation from total proteins of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> wild-type seedlings grown in continuous light (100 µmol photons m<sup>−2</sup>s<sup>−1</sup>). Consistent with previous results, two Trp residues in D1, namely Trp-14 and Trp-317, were shown to be oxidized (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1</xref> and <xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">S2</xref>). The total sequence coverage obtained by our mass spectrometry for D1 was 26%. Further mass spectrometry in extracts <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> mutants <italic>var2</italic> lacking FtsH2, which is shown to impair D1 degradation and exhibit substantial accumulation of ROS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Kato et al., 2009</xref>), revealed the accumulation of oxidized Trp in the PSII complex. The oxidation levels in Trp-14 and Trp-314 increased 1.8-fold and 1.4-fold in <italic>var2</italic> compared to the wild type, respectively (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>). These results prompted us to characterize the role of these Trp oxidations in the PSII repair further.</p>

<p>To validate whether Trp oxidation detected in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>seedings is also detectable in other model organisms, we investigated extracts from <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> thylakoid membranes (Table1 and Supplementary Table S2). Mass spectrometry following trypsin digestion demonstrated that several Trp residues in PSII were oxidized; among the core subunits, D1 had oxidation of four residues, D2 had three, CP43 had five, and CP47 had three (Table1 and Supplementary Table S2). The position of oxidized Trp residues in their amino acid sequence was shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref> and <xref rid="figS3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3</xref>. Together with previous studies, Trp-14 and Trp-317 in D1, Trp-21 and Trp-328 in D2, Trp-353 and Trp-375 in CP43, and Trp-275 and Trp-302 in CP47 were commonly identified among at least two organisms. Spatial arrangement of these Trp residues that were commonly oxidized in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> was compared within the structure of PSII complex, as shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.1d</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">e</xref> (oxidized Trp residues were assigned in the PSII dimer, and its 3D image is shown in Supplementary Movie 1 online). Also, oxidized Trp residues were assigned in the PSII structure from <italic>Thermosynecoccocus vulcanus</italic> and were shown in <xref rid="figS4" ref-type="fig">Fig. S4</xref>. Intriguingly, most of these oxidized Trp residues are positioned at the luminal side of the PSII core complex, which appeared to surround the Mn<sub>4</sub>O<sub>5</sub>Ca cluster in the PSII structure model. In contrast, two oxidized Trp residues, Trp-14 in D1 and Trp-21 in D2 close to the N-terminus of the polypeptides, are located on the stromal side. The fact that the oxidized Trp residues are predominantly observed around the Mn<sub>4</sub>O<sub>5</sub>Ca cluster may reflect photoinhibition of PSII electron donor side and concomitant ROS generation. In contrast, stromal Trp oxidation is novel and localized at the N-terminal alpha-helix, which might suggest its effects in processive D1 degradation.</p>

<title>Site-directed mutagenesis of Trp residues undergoing OPTM in D1</title>
<p>To test whether any change in the oxidized Trp residues is associated with D1 degradation, we performed site-directed mutagenesis using chloroplast transformation in <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic>, to substitute the corresponding Trp for other amino acids in D1. Based on the mass-spectrometric results, we focused on Trp-14 and Trp-317, each of which was replaced by Ala (non-polar and hydrophobic) or Phe (aromatic and hydrophobic), respectively. The vectors harboring spectinomycin/streptomycin-resistant <italic>aadA</italic> cassette and the mutated <italic>psbA</italic> gene were transformed into λ1<italic>psbA</italic> mutant Fud7 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>). Transformants were selected on mixotrophic Tris-acetate-phosphate (TAP) plates containing spectinomycin, and their homoplasmicity was subsequently confirmed by PCR using specific primers and sequencing. All transformants grew like the control strain on mixotrophic TAP plates (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref>). However, the transformants in which Trp-14 or Trp-317 was substituted to Ala, (W14A, W317A, and W14A/W317A) showed significantly impaired growth on photoautotrophic high salt minimal (HSM) plates. Ala substitution at both Trp-14 and Trp-317 led to decreased photosynthetic activities due to reduced accumulation of D1 and other PSII core proteins (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b -d</xref>), indicating its defect in stability and/or the translation of D1 protein.</p>

<p>In contrast, Phe substitution at the same sites had little effect on their growth under growth light (30 µmol photons m<sup>-2</sup>s<sup>-1</sup>). These transformants (W14F, W317F, and W14F/W317F) accumulated PSII core proteins whose amounts were comparable to the control levels. They showed normal photosynthetic activities as evidenced by comparable electron transport rates through the PSII complex and oxygen-evolving activity (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c and e</xref>). We next examined their photoautotrophic growth under high light (320 µmol photons m<sup>-2</sup>s<sup>-1</sup>). Under this condition, however, W14F exhibited significantly impaired growth, and W317F grew slightly slower than control cells. Double mutant W14F/W317F synergistically increased high-light sensitivity but the growth defect appeared to be similar to W14F, suggesting that Phe substitution at Trp-14, but not at Trp-317 had profound effects in the PSII repair cycle (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref> and <xref rid="figS5" ref-type="fig">Fig. S5</xref>).</p>

<title>Site-directed mutagenesis of Trp residues in CP43</title>
<p>We next examined if Trp modification in CP43 influences in high-light sensitivity. As an important step in the PSII repair, PSII complex is partially disassembled by CP43 detachment, and this process likely allows FtsH to access photo-damaged D1. Therefore, Trp oxidation in CP43 may play a role in PSII disassembly and D1 degradation concomitantly. To test this, we substituted Trp-353 and Trp-375 for either Ala or Phe as carried out in D1. Transformants were generated by cotransformation of Fud7, using the vector harboring wild-type <italic>psbA</italic> gene and the vector harboring the mutated <italic>psbC</italic> gene. Consequently, we obtained four single mutants (W353A, W353F, W375A, and W375F) and two double mutants (W353A/W375A and W353A/W375F) (<xref rid="figS6" ref-type="fig">Fig. S6</xref>). Mixotrophic growth on TAP plates was comparable among all transformants and control cells (<xref rid="figS6" ref-type="fig">Fig. S6</xref>). All the transformants except for W353A/W375A grew normally on the phototrophic condition under growth light condition. Supporting normal growth, immunoblot analysis showed normal accumulation of PSII core proteins, D1 and CP43, in all lines except for the double mutant W353A/W375A. On the other hand, D1 and CP43 were severely reduced in W353A/W375A, indicating that Ala substitution in these residues resulted in highly unstable or impaired PSII complex formation (<xref rid="figS6" ref-type="fig">Fig. S6</xref>). Further analysis of these mutants under high light showed that the transformants did not increase high-light sensitivity on their growth unlike D1 W14F mutant. At least in our site-directed mutagenesis, Trp oxidation in CP43 appeared to have little impact on the PSII repair.</p>

<title>Substitution of Trp-14 with Phe accelerates D1 degradation</title>
<p>To evaluate whether Trp substitution in D1 affects PSII damage or repair, we next measured the maximum quantum yield of PSII (Fv/Fm) and subsequently monitored D1 levels under growth or high-light conditions. Trp-substituted lines grown in TAP medium under growth light were pre-incubated in the presence or absence of chloramphenicol (CAM), an inhibitor of chloroplast protein synthesis. CAM blocks the PSII repair at the step of D1 synthesis and allows us to evaluate photodamage and D1 degradation. Cells incubated under growth light or high light were subjected to chlorophyll fluorescence measurement and immunoblot analysis. Under growth light condition and in the absence of CAM, both PSII activity (Fv/Fm values) and D1 levels were comparable among all Trp-substituted lines and the control (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>). This result was consistent with their photoautotrophic growth under growth light. When CAM was added, D1 levels decreased only slightly during incubation (90 min) in the control. D1 degradation rate was comparable in all Trp-substituted lines and control (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3c</xref>), indicating that all Trp-substituted D1 proteins formed stable and functional PSII complex under growth light.</p>

</fig>
<p>Under high-light condition, however, Fv/Fm values in Trp-substituted lines significantly decreased, compared to that observed in the control even in the absence of CAM (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref>). These vulnerabilities to high light were consistent with their impaired growth under high light (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). To our surprise, D1 levels in W14F and W14F/W317F concomitantly decreased during highlight incubation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref>). In contrast, D1 levels in W317F were similar to those in control cells. When the PSII repair engages properly, high-light irradiation does not alter D1 levels because turnover of photo-damaged D1 encounters rapid D1 synthesis. Given decreased D1 under high light, W14F was likely to cause faster D1 degradation. To confirm this possibility, D1 degradation in the presence of CAM was measured. PSII activity in all Trp-substituted lines fell at similar rates compared with control cells in the presence of the CAM (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3d</xref>), indicating the light-induced damage was at the similar level among all Trp-substituted lines and the control. In contrast, our time course experiment indicated that W14F and W14F/W317F decreased D1 faster than the control and W317F (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3d</xref>); the D1 level in W14F and W14F/W317F decreased approximately 60% and 50% of the initial level, respectively, whereas those in control cells and W317F remained 80% (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3d</xref>).</p>
<p>Based on these D1 degradation assays, we assumed that D1 degradation by proteolysis was enhanced by W14F substitution, despite the fact that PSII suffered from photodamage equally among other lines and the control during high-light irradiation. To exclude the possibility that W14F decelerates D1 synthesis rather than accelerating degradation, we analyzed protein synthesis in Trp-substituted lines by in vivo pulse labeling in the presence of cycloheximide, which prevents the synthesis of the nuclear-encoded proteins. As shown in <xref rid="figS7" ref-type="fig">Fig. S7</xref>, D1 synthesis was shown to proceed comparably in all lines. Collectively, our findings demonstrated that Trp-14 substitution to Phe enhanced D1 degradation, whereas it affected neither the light-induced damage in PSII, D1 synthesis, nor PSII stability.</p>

<title>Enhanced D1 degradation due to the substitution of Trp-14 is mitigated in the <italic>ftsH</italic> mutant</title>
<p>To address whether the increased D1 degradation in W14F (and W14F/W317F) involved proteolysis by FtsH, these Trp substitutions were introduced into an <italic>ftsH</italic> mutant deficient in thylakoid FtsH activity.

<title>Molecular dynamics simulation suggests W14F mimicking Trp-14 oxidation</title>
<p>Although our site-directed mutagenesis in Trp-14 showed its effect in D1 degradation, how Trp oxidation can be structurally correlated with Trp to Phe mutagenesis should be taken into consideration. To investigate this, we employed molecular dynamics (MD) simulation, a powerful tool to simulate movements of amino acids in a protein complex, using the crystal structure of PSII complex from <italic>Thermosynechococcus vulcanus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Sakashita et al., 2017b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Sakashita et al., 2017a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Kawashima et al., 2018</xref>). D1 Trp-14 is located in the first α-helix at the N-terminus and hydrogen-bonded with PsbI Ser-25 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5a</xref>). It is deduced that this hydrogen bond restricts the conformational change around D1 Trp-14 and limit the fluctuation of D1 N-terminus. The simulation indicated that the hydrogen bond disappeared (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5b</xref>, c) and the structural fluctuation of D1 Trp-14 was increased as compared with WT (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5d</xref>) when Trp-14 is oxidized to NFK or is replaced with Phe residue. The increased fluctuation of the side chain also influences the Cβ-Cβ distance between D1 Trp-14 and PsbI Ser-25; the two Cβ atoms became farther away from each other when D1 Trp-14 is oxidized to NFK (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5e</xref>). Of note, the amino acid substitution on Trp-14 to Phe showed similar trends as those observed when D1-Trp-14 is oxidized to NFK. These results suggest that the structural change of Trp-14 affect the local movement. The increased fluctuation of the first α-helix of D1 would give a chance to recognize the photo-damaged D1 by FtsH protease.</p>

<title>Augmented interaction between D1 and FtsH by substituting Trp-14/317</title>
<p>Presented experimental results collectively raise the possibility that oxidation of Trp-14 is one of the key OPTMs for D1 degradation by FtsH. We raised a possibility that W14F mimics Trp-14 oxidation and shows increased FtsH association with D1. Since quantitative interaction of the protein and the protease remains to be elucidated, we performed differential pull-down assay. To emphasize the effect of the substituted amino acid residues and minimize potential oxidation of other amino acid residues, we decreased light intensity during cell culture and removed oxygen molecule from the buffer solution during the assay. <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> cells were grown under dim light with gently shaking and were harvested at the mid-log phase. Subsequently, we isolated thylakoid membrane from the gently disrupted cells and performed co-immunoprecipitation in anoxic aqueous solution.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Recent progress in mass-spectrometry has advanced our understanding of holistic OPTM in photosynthetic protein complexes. Along this line, we investigated Trp oxidation in PSII in this study, and attempted to address whether any modification in amino acid residues was correlated with the PSII repair. PSII is one of the major sites for ROS generation due to photoinhibition, and oxidized amino acid residues in PSII core proteins have been reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Kale et al., 2017</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Frankel et al., 2012</xref>). In general, Met and Cys are sensitive amino acid residues for ROS-mediated oxidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Rinalducci et al., 2008</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Ehrenshaft et al., 2015</xref>). However, those OPTM can be converted back in reduced forms by methionine sulfoxide reductase and disulfide reductase, respectively. In contrast, Trp oxidation is irreversible, and its replacement requires whole protein degradation and de novo synthesis, implicating Trp suitable for flagging photo-oxidative damaged proteins that undergo degradation in the PSII repair.</p>
<p>Previous studies have reported OPTM of several Trp residues in PSII core proteins in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Dreaden Kasson et al., 2012</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Dreaden et al., 2011</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Anderson et al., 2002</xref>). In addition, Dogra et al. confirmed several oxidized Trp residues in PSII core proteins of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Dogra et al., 2019</xref>). Our mass-spectrometry in <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic>further indicated that oxidation in some of the Trp residues was detected among algae and land plants. It is noteworthy that a majority of Trp residues are located on the luminal side (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) in the vicinity of the Mn<sub>4</sub>O<sub>5</sub>Ca cluster, consistent with the previous observations that amino acid residues around the Mn<sub>4</sub>O<sub>5</sub>Ca cluster are oxidized at the early stage of photoinhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Kale et al., 2017</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Frankel et al., 2012</xref>). However, OPTM is not limited to the luminal side but also found in the stromal side, which accounts for photoinhibition at the electron acceptor side (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Vass, 2012</xref>). Our data indicated the presence of commonly oxidized Trp residues as represented by Trp-14 and Trp-317 in D1 protein. These are in fact Trp residues highly conserved among photosynthetic organisms (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.1</xref>). Technically, detection of light-dependent OPTM was considered to be difficult; an extensive OPTM leads to fully inactive PSII, whereas D1 degradation in the PSII repair may diminish OPTM under optimal light conditions. We therefore assumed that OPTM associated with PSII repair might accumulate significantly in the mutant that is defective in FtsH. Supporting this, our quantitative mass spectrometry indicated that <italic>var2</italic> lacking FtsH2 in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> had increased levels of oxidation in Trp residues, particularly in Trp-14 and Trp-317. Although indirect, these results strongly suggested an interconnection between Trp oxidation and D1 degradation.</p>

<p>OPTM of Trp residues causes irreversible modification in D1 protein and is likely to mark a substrate of D1 degradation. In the PSII repair, a series of events including migration of photo-damaged PSII to non-appressed regions of thylakoid membranes, release of CP43 from the PSII, and recognition of photo-damaged D1 for selective D1 degradation, are essential. In this scenario, FtsH interacts with a partially disassembled PSII complex lacking CP43 protein, called RC47 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Kato and Sakamoto, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Järvi et al., 2015</xref>). Close access to the photo-damaged D1, followed by the recognition of its N-terminal region, is concomitantly necessary for FtsH to proceed with processive D1 degradation. Therefore, the OPTM would be involved in the CP43 disassembly or the recognition of damaged D1 protein. Krynická et al. indicate that the accessibility to PSII core proteins drives selective protein degradation by FtsH in the cyanobacterium <italic>Synechocystis</italic> PCC 6803 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Krynická et al., 2015</xref>). This observation suggests that D1 protein in the RC47 complex is promptly degraded even if D1 did not suffer from photodamage. However, all site-directed mutants mimicking Try oxidation by Trp to Phe substitution have stable and functional PSII complexes under growth light, suggesting that the OPTM would not induce the disassembly of CP43. We also tested whether Trp oxidation in CP43 affects PSII repair by site-directed mutagenesis. Similarly to the case in D1, none of Trp substitutions at the site of OPTM in CP43 (Trp-353 and Trp-375) affected the D1 degradation. Additionally, the CP43 transformants did not show the increased photosensitivity (<xref rid="figS6" ref-type="fig">Fig. S6</xref>). Our results somewhat appear to contradict the previous report in cyanobacterium that the mutants in which Trp-353 (Trp-352 in <italic>Synechocystis</italic> 6803) was substituted to Leu, Cyc, or Ala increased photo-sensitivity under high-light conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Anderson et al., 2002</xref>). This might be due to the use of extremely high-light irradiation (5,000 µmol photons m<sup>­2</sup> s<sup>­1</sup>), under which severe photo-damage in PSII complex was rendered. We consider that irreversible Trp oxidation in CP43, if to be repaired, may require a rapid turnover rate comparable to D1 degradation, which is not the case. Although further study is necessary to elucidate the disassembly mechanisms of CP43 during the PSII repair cycle, Trp oxidation in D1, rather than CP43 disassembly, might be important for the recognition of FtsH.</p>
<p>To examine its effect on D1 degradation, we performed site-directed mutagenesis of the corresponding Trp residues using <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> chloroplast transformation. While Trp to Ala substitution in these sites (W14A or W317A) appeared to compromise PSII complex formation, Trp to Phe substitution (W14F and W317) gave us a hint in the critical role of OPTM. We showed that W14F, but not W317F, caused higher photo-sensitivity with the rapid decrease of D1 under high-light irradiation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). Given that W14F affected neither D1 synthesis (<xref rid="figS7" ref-type="fig">Fig. S7</xref>), stability of PSII complex formation, nor PSII activity under non-photoinhibitory conditions, it was concluded that the mutation results in enhanced D1 degradation. In our D1 degradation assay of wild type, generally, D1 turnover is too fast to detect unless inhibitor of chloroplast protein synthesis (CAM) is added. In sharp contrast, W14F proceeds with rapid D1 degradation even without CAM. Reportedly, numerous amino acid substitutions have been introduced in D1, which may or may not compromise PSII activity. To our knowledge, however, mutations that accelerate D1 degradation have not been found except for W14F in this study. We thus consider that Trp-14 is particularly important, at least for FtsH to recognize photodamaged D1 as described below.</p>
<p>Because FtsH-mediated D1 degradation is crucial for the PSII repair cycle, recognition of photodamaged D1 by FtsH protease is a critical step. Following observations suggest that Trp-14 oxidation is one of the key OPTMs for degrading photodamaged D1. First, enhanced D1 degradation in W14F well fits the notion that PTM in the N-terminus of D1 is important to execute processive degradation by FtsH, as proposed previously. For example, the lack of an N-terminal helix attenuates proper D1 degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Komenda et al., 2007</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Michoux et al., 2016</xref>). The excision of N-terminal Met by organellar Met aminopeptidase and prokaryotic-like peptide deformylase was shown to be required for FtsH-mediated D1 degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Adam et al., 2011</xref>). Phosphorylation of the D1 N-terminus was also shown to affect proteolysis and contribute to the fine-tuned D1 degradation pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Koivuniemi et al., 1995</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Rintamäki et al., 1996</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Kato and Sakamoto, 2014</xref>). Together with these, it is possible that Trp-14 oxidation is likely to play a role in ‘photodamage-dependent’ degradation, although we cannot rule out the possibility that other OPTMs may have additive effects. Second, our MD simulation strongly suggests that W14F is similar to Trp-14 oxidation W14* (modified as NFK) in terms of allowing a regional conformational change around the N-terminal helix, thereby increasing fluctuation of the side chain. This fluctuation appears to be manifested by losing hydrogen bonding with Ser-25 of PsbI, a short peptide localized close to D1 and CP43 in the PSII core complex. Although further studies are needed, our simulation is consistent with our notion that Trp-14 is a target of OPTM that alters subtle but critical structural change at the N-terminus of D1.</p>
<p>Based on these observations, we propose a working model of ‘photodamaged D1 recognition’ in which Trp oxidation plays a role in processive degradation by FtsH (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6c</xref>). As a consequence of photoinhibition, ROS is produced around PSII and leads to OPTM of numerous residues. Among these, Trp-14 and Trp-317 are prone to oxidation likely due to their relative positions in PSII. While oxidation takes place in both, Trp-14 causes a conformational change at the N-terminus, which triggers enhanced access of FtsH for subsequent processive degradation. Supporting this, we observed augmented association between D1 and FtsH in W14F/W317F (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>). It is unlikely, however, that Trp-14 oxidation alone is sufficient to drive degradation of photodamaged D1, because a stepwise dissociation of PSII core complexes is prerequisite.</p>
<p>OPTM of Trp residues has been observed in various proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Kasson and Barry, 2012</xref>). For example, Trp oxidation has been identified in ATP synthase alpha subunit in mitochondria, one of the target proteins for oxidative stress in the mitochondrial inner membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Rexroth et al., 2012</xref>). In this case, the oxidation is not random but selectively targets specific Trp. The oxidized ATP synthase might be degraded by mitochondrial FtsH homologs, m-AAA and i-AAA proteases, which have an essential role in the quality control of aberrant proteins in mitochondrial membranes. Furthermore, a previous study in chloroplasts suggests the Trp oxidation in the stress responses related to singlet oxygen; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Dogra et al. (2019)</xref> report specific oxidation of Trp in EXECUTER1 (EX1), a sensor protein of singlet oxygen in plastid signaling. The oxidation of specific Trp residue is required for ROS signaling mediated by light-dependent EX1 degradation by FtsH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Dogra et al., 2019</xref>). Together with our results, these reports imply a general mechanism between oxidized modification of target protein and substrate recognition by FtsH. Future proteomic approaches for investigating OPTM will reveal the general substrate recognition mechanisms by FtsH in the thylakoid membranes.</p>

<p>This study adds a <bold>valuable</bold> new perspective to a long-standing question: What controls the repair of photosystem II (PSII), a key process in maintaining and optimizing photosynthesis? The work supports a role for chemical modification in the recognition and subsequent degradation of a key protein subunit of PSII by a bacterial-type protease, suggesting that tryptophan oxidation of components of the photosynthetic apparatus after high light stress plays a critical role in initiating the PSII repair system. The evidence supporting the authors' conclusions is <bold>solid</bold>, although their arguments would be strengthened by additional experiments.</p>

<p>This manuscript tried to answer a long-standing question in an important research topic. I read it with great interest. The quality of the science is high, and the text is clearly written. The conclusion is exciting. However, I feel that the phenotype of the transgenic line may be explained by an alternative idea. At least, the results should be more carefully discussed.</p>
<p>Specific comments:</p>
<p>1. Stability or activity (Fv/Fm) was not affected in PSII with the W14F mutation in D1. If W14F really represents the status of PSII with oxidized D1, what is the reason for the degradation of almost normal D1?</p>
<p>2. To focus on the PSII in which W14 is oxidized, this research depends on the W14F mutant lines. It is critical how exactly the W-to-F substitution mimics the oxidized W. The authors tried to show it in Figure 5. Because of the technical difficulty, it may be unfair to request more evidence. But the paper would be more convincing with the results directly monitoring the oxidized D1 to be recognized by FtsH.</p>
<p>3. Figure 3. If the F14 mimics the oxidized W14 and is sensed by FtsH, I would expect the degradation of D1 even under the growth light. The actual result suggests that W14F mutation partially modifies the structure of D1 under high light and this structural modification of D1 is sensed by FtsH. Namely, high light may induce another event which is recognized by FtsH. The W14F is just an enhancer.</p>

<p>In their manuscript, Kato et al investigate a key aspect of membrane protein quality control in plant photosynthesis. They study the turnover of plant photosystem II (PSII), a hetero-oligomeric membrane protein complex that undertakes the crucial light-driven water oxidation reaction in photosynthesis. The formidable water oxidation reaction makes PSII prone to photooxidative damage. PSII repair cycle is a protein repair pathway that replaces the photodamaged reaction center protein D1 with a new copy. The manuscript addresses an important question in PSII repair cycle - how is the damaged D1 protein recognized and selectively degraded by the membrane-bound ATP-dependent zinc metalloprotease FtsH in a processive manner? The authors show that oxidative post-translational modification (OPTM) of the D1 N-terminus is likely critical for the proper recognition and degradation of the damaged D1 by FtsH. Authors use a wide range of approaches and techniques to test their hypothesis that the singlet oxygen (1O2)-mediated oxidation of tryptophan 14 (W14) residue of D1 to N-formylkynurenine (NFK) facilitates the selective degradation of damaged D1. Overall, the authors propose an interesting new hypothesis for D1 degradation and their hypothesis is supported by most of the experimental data provided. The study certainly addresses an elusive aspect of PSII turnover and the data provided go some way in explaining the light-induced D1 turnover. However, some of the data are correlative and do not provide mechanistic insight. A rigorous demonstration of OPTM as a marker for D1 degradation is yet to be made in my opinion. Some strengths and weaknesses of the study are summarized below:</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>1. In support of their hypothesis, the authors find that FtsH mutants of Arabidopsis have increased OPTM, especially the formation of NFK at multiple Trp residues of D1 including the W14; a site-directed mutation of W14 to phenylalanine (W14F), mimicking NFK, results in accelerated D1 degradation in Chlamydomonas; accelerated D1 degradation of W14F mutant is mitigated in an ftsH1 mutant background of Chlamydomonas; and that the W14F mutation augmented the interaction between FtsH and the D1 substrate.</p>
<p>2. Authors raise an intriguing possibility that the OPTM disrupts the hydrogen bonding between W14 residue of D1 and the serine 25 (S25) of PsbI. According to the authors, this leads to an increased fluctuation of the D1 N-terminal tail, and as a consequence, recognition and binding of the photodamaged D1 by the protease. This is an interesting hypothesis and the authors provide some molecular dynamics simulation data in support of this. If this hypothesis is further supported, it represents a significant advancement.</p>
<p>3. The interdisciplinary experimental approach is certainly a strength of the study. The authors have successfully combined mass spectrometric analysis with several biochemical assays and molecular dynamics simulation. These, together with the generation of transplastomic algal cell lines, have enabled a clear test of the role of Trp oxidation in selective D1 degradation.</p>
<p>4. Trp oxidative modification as a degradation signal has precedent in chloroplasts. The authors cite the case of 1O2 sensor protein EXECUTER 1 (EX1), whose degradation by FtsH2, the same protease that degrades D1, requires prior oxidation of a Trp residue. The earlier observation of an attenuated degradation of a truncated D1 protein lacking the N-terminal tail is also consistent with authors' suggestion of the importance of the D1 N-terminus recognition by FtsH. It is also noteworthy that in light of the current study, D1 phosphorylation is unlikely to be a marker for degradation as posited by earlier studies.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>1. The study lacks some data that would have made the conclusions more rigorous and convincing. It is unclear why the level of Trp oxidation was not analyzed in the Chlamydomonas ftsH 1-1 mutant as done for the var 2 mutant. Increased oxidation of W14 OPTM in Chlamydomonas ftsH 1-1 is a key prediction of the hypothesis. It is also unclear to me what is the rationale for showing D1-FtsH interaction data only for the double mutant but not for the single mutant (W14F). Why is the FtsH pulldown of D2 not statistically significant (p value = {less than or equal to}0.1). Wouldn't one expect FtsH pulls down the RC47 complex containing D1, D2, and RC47. Probing the RC47 level would have been useful in settling this. A key proposition of the authors' is that the hydrogen bonding between D1 W14 and S25 of PsbI is disrupted by the oxidative modification of W14. Can this hypothesis be further tested by replacing the S25 of PsbI with Ala, for example?</p>
<p>2. Although most of the work described is in vivo analysis, which is desirable, some in vitro degradation assays would have strengthened the conclusions. An in vitro degradation assay using the recombinant FtsH and a synthetic peptide encompassing D1 N-terminus with and without OPTM will test the enhanced D1 degradation that the authors predict. This will also help to discern the possibility that whether CP43 detachment alone is sufficient for D1 degradation as suggested for cyanobacteria.</p>
<p>3. The rationale for analyzing a single oxidative modification (W14) as a D1 degradation signal is unclear. D1 N-terminus is modified at multiple sites. Please see Mckenzie and Puthiyaveetil, bioRxiv May 04 2023. Also, why is modification by only 1O2 considered while superoxide and hydroxide radicals can equally damage D1?</p>
<p>4. The D1 degradation assay seems not repeatable for the W14F mutant. High light minus CAM results in Fig. 3 shows a statistically significant decrease in D1 levels for W14F at multiple time points but the same assay in Fig. 4a does not produce a statistically significant decrease at 90 min of incubation. Why is this? Accelerated D1 degradation in the Phe mutant under high light is key evidence that the authors cite in support of their hypothesis.</p>
<p>5. The description of results at times is not nuanced enough, for e.g. lines 116-117 state &quot;The oxidation levels in Trp-14 and Trp-314 increased 1.8-fold and 1.4-fold in var2 compared to the wild type, respectively (Fig. 1c)&quot; while an inspection of the figure reveals that modification at W314 is significant only for NFK and not for KYN and OIA. Likewise, the authors write that CP43 mutant W353F has no growth phenotype under high light but Figure S6 reveals otherwise. The slow growth of this mutant is in line with the earlier observation made by Anderson et al., 2002. In lines 162-163, the authors talk about unchanged electron transport in some site-directed mutants and cite Fig. 2c but this figure only shows chl fluorescence trace and nothing else.</p>
<p>6. The authors rightly discuss an alternate hypothesis that the simple disassembly of the monomeric core into RC47 and CP43 alone may be sufficient for selective D1 degradation as in cyanobacteria. This hypothesis cannot yet be ruled out completely given the lack of some in vitro degradation data as mentioned in point 2. Oxidative protein modification indeed drives the disassembly of the monomeric core (Mckenzie and Puthiyaveetil, bioRxiv May 04 2023).</p>

<p>Light energy drives photosynthesis. However, excessive light can damage (i.e., photo-damage) and thus inactivate the photosynthetic process. A major target site of photo-damage is photosystem II (PSII). In particular, one component of PSII, the reaction center protein, D1, is very suspectable to photo-damage, however, this protein is maintained efficiently by an elaborate multi-step PSII-D1 turnover/repair cycle. Two proteases, FtsH and Deg, are known to contribute to this process, respectively, by efficient degradation of photo-damaged D1 protein processively and endoproteolytically. In this manuscript, Kato et al., propose an additional step (an early step) in the D1 degradation/repair pathway. They propose that &quot;Tryptophan oxidation&quot; at the N-terminus of D1 may be one of the key oxidations in the PSII repair, leading to processive degradation of D1 by FtsH. Both, their data and arguments are very compelling.</p>
<p>The D1 protein repair/degradation pathway in its simplest form can be defined essentially by five steps: (1) migration of damaged PSII core complex to the stroma thylakoid, (2) partial PSII disassembly of the PSII core monomer, (3) access of protease degrading damaged D1, (4) concomitant D1 synthesis, and (5) reassembly of PSII into grana thylakoid. An enormous amount of work has already been done to define and characterize these various steps. Kato et al., in this manuscript, are proposing a very early yet novel critical step in D1 protein turnover in which Tryptophan(Trp) oxidation in PSII core proteins influences D1 degradation mediated by FtsH.</p>
<p>Using a variety of approaches, such as mass-spectrometry (Table 1), site-directed mutagenesis (Figures 2-4), D1 degradation assays (Figures 3, and 4), and simulation modeling (Figure 5), Kato et al., provide both strong evidence and reasonable arguments that an N-terminal Trp oxidation may be likely to be a 'key' oxidative post-translational modification (OPTM) that is involved in triggering D1 degradation and thus activating the PSII repair pathway. Consequently, from their accumulated data, the authors propose a scenario in which the unraveling of the N-terminal of the D1 protein facilitated by Trp oxidation plays a critical 'recognition' role in alerting the plant that the D1 protein is photo-damaged and thus to kick start the processive degradation pathway initiated possibly by FtsH. Coincidently, Forsman and Eaton-Rye (Biochemistry 2021, 60, 1, 53-63), while working with the thermophilic cyanobacterium, Thermosynechococcus vulcanus, showed that when the N-terminal DE-loop of the D1 protein is photo-damaged a disruption of the interaction between the PsbT subunit and D1 occurs which may serve as a signal for PSII to undergo repair following photodamage. While the activation of the processive degradation pathways in Chlamydomonas versus Thermosynechococcus vulcanus have significant mechanistic differences, it's interesting to note and speculate that the stability of the N-terminal of their respective D1 proteins seems to play a critical role in 'signaling' the PSII repair system to be activated and initiate repair. But it's complicated. For instance, significant Trp oxidation also occurs on the lumen side of other PSII subunits which may also play a significant role in activating the repair processes as well. Indeed, Kato et al.,( Photosynthesis Research volume 126, pages 409-416 (2015)) proposed a two-step model whereby the primary event is disruption of a Mn-cluster in PSII on the lumen side. A secondary event is damage to D1 caused by energy that is absorbed by chlorophyll. But models adapt, change, and get updated. And the data provided by Kato et al., in this manuscript, gives us a unique glimpse/snapshot into the importance of the stability of the N-terminal during photo-damage and its role in D1-turnover. For instance, the author's use site-directed mutagenesis of Trp residues undergoing OPTM in the D1 protein coupled with their D1 degradation assays (Figure 3 and 4), provides evidence that Trp oxidation (in particular the oxidation of Trp14) in coordination with FtsH results in the degradation of D1 protein. Indeed, their D1 degradation assays coupled with the use of a ftsh mutant provide further significant support that Trp14 oxidation and FtsH activity are strongly linked. But for FstH to degrade D1 protein it needs to gain access to photo-damaged D1. FtsH access to D1 is achieved by having CP43 partially dissociate from the PSII complex. Hence, the authors also addressed the possibility that Trp oxidation may also play a role in CP43 disassembly from the PSII complex thereby giving FtsH access to D1. Using a site-directed mutagenesis approach, they showed that Trp oxidation in CP43 appeared to have little impact on the PSII repair (Supplemental Figure S6). This result shows that D1-Trp14 oxidation appears to be playing a role in D1 turnover that occurs after CP43 disassembly from the PSII complex. Alternatively, the authors cannot exclude the possibility that D1-Trp14 oxidation in some way facilitates CP43 dissociation. Further investigation is needed on this point. However, D1-Trp14 oxidation is causing an internal disruption of the D1 protein possibly at the N-terminus of the protein. Consequently, the role of Trp14 oxidation in disrupting the stability of the N-terminal domain of the D1 protein was analyzed computationally. Using a molecular dynamics approach (Figure 5), the authors attempted to create a mechanistic model to explain why when D1 protein Trp14 undergoes oxidation the N-terminal domain of D1protein becomes unraveled. Specifically, the authors propose that the interaction between D1 protein Trp14 with PsbI Ser25 becomes disrupted upon oxidation of Trp14. Consequently, the authors concluded from their molecular dynamics simulation analysis that &quot; the increased fluctuation of the first α-helix of D1 would give a chance to recognize the photo-damaged D1 by FtsH protease&quot;. Hence, the author's experimental and computational approaches employed here develop a compelling early-stage repair model that integrates 1) Trp14 oxidation, 2) FtsH activation and 3) D1- turnover being initiated at its N-terminal domain. However, a word of caution should be emphasized here. This model is just a snapshot of the very early stages of the D1 protein turnover process. The data presented here gives us just a small glimpse into the unique relationship between Trp oxidation of the D1 protein which may trigger significant N-terminal structural changes of the D1 protein that both signals and provides an opportunity for FstH to begin protease digestion of the D1 protein. However, the authors go to great lengths in their discussion section to not overstate solely the role of Trp14 oxidation in the complicated process of D1 turnover. The authors certainly recognize that there are a lot of moving parts involved in D1 turnover. And while Trp14 oxidation is the major focus of this paper, the authors show in Supplemental Fig S4 the structural positions of various additional oxidized Trp residues in the Thermosynecoccocus vulcans PSII core proteins. Indeed, this figure shows that the majority of oxidized Trps are located on the luminal side of PSII complex clustered around the oxygen-evolving complex. So, while oxidized Trp14 may be involved in the early stages of D1 turnover certainly oxidized Trps on the lumen side are also more than likely playing a role in D1 turnover as well. To untangle this complex process will require additional research.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, identifying and characterizing the role of oxidative modification of tryptophan (Trp) residues, in particular, Trp14, in the PSII core provides another critical step in an already intricate multi-step process of D1 protein turnover during photo-damage.</p>
