<title>Abstract</title>
<p>The IncRNA Malat1 was initially believed to be dispensable for physiology due to the lack of observable phenotypes in Malat1 knockout (KO) mice. However, our study challenges this conclusion. We found that both Malat1 KO and conditional KO mice in the osteoblast lineage exhibit significant osteoporosis. Mechanistically, Malat1 acts as an intrinsic regulator in osteoblasts to promote osteogenesis. Interestingly, Malat1 does not directly affect osteoclastogenesis but inhibits osteoclastogenesis in a non-autonomous manner <italic>in vivo</italic> via integrating crosstalk between multiple cell types, including osteoblasts, osteoclasts and chondrocytes. Our findings substantiate the existence of a novel remodeling network in which Malat1 serves as a central regulator by binding to β-catenin and functioning through the β-catenin-OPG/Jagged1 pathway in osteoblasts and chondrocytes. In pathological conditions, Malat1 significantly promotes bone regeneration in fracture healing. Bone homeostasis and regeneration are crucial to well-being. Our discoveries establish a previous unrecognized paradigm model of Malat1 function in the skeletal system, providing novel mechanistic insights into how a lncRNA integrates cellular crosstalk and molecular networks to fine tune tissue homeostasis, remodeling and repair.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Recent genome-wide transcriptome analyses revealed that over 75% of the human genome is transcribed, among which about 95% are transcripts without coding capacity. Long noncoding RNAs (IncRNAs) emerge as a relatively new category of non-coding RNAs (≥ 500 nucleotides <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>). It is now widely accepted that lncRNAs can perform diverse regulatory roles in regulation of gene expression. lncRNAs are enriched in the nucleus and/or cytoplasm and possess the ability to interact with versatile biomolecules, including various proteins, chromosomal DNAs and RNAs. Therefore, in contrast to miRNAs, lncRNAs regulate gene expression and function by diverse mechanisms, such as functioning as scaffolds for transcriptional and chromatin-modifying complex assemblies, as enhancers or decoys regulating gene transcription, and as cis-acting or trans-acting regulators involved in gene expression and epigenetic regulation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. Importantly, lncRNAs are druggable targets, and identification of the functional importance of lncRNAs has unveiled new diagnostic and therapeutic opportunities for human diseases, such as cancer, cardiovascular diseases and genetic disorders <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. Understanding the biological importance and clinical relevance of lncRNAs is at the forefront of RNA biology research. Nonetheless, only a small fraction of lncRNAs have well-established identifications. Most lncRNAs lack functional annotations, particularly with genetic evidence in vivo and convincing mechanistic studies.</p>
<p>Malat1 (metastasis associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1) is a highly evolutionarily conserved and abundant nuclear lncRNA. It is a 6.8 kilo-nucleotide RNA Polymerase II transcript from mouse chromosome 19 (8.9 kilo-nucleotide from human chromosome 11). As one of the first discovered lncRNAs, Malat1 was initially recognized as a gene showing specific upregulation in metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>. Subsequent studies found a variety of associations between Malat1 and the growth and metastasis of different cancers, such as lung cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, and breast cancer <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. In physiological settings, although Malat1 was reported to be a key component of nuclear speckle and a regulator of alternative pre-mRNA splicing in <italic>in vitro</italic> studies, Malat1 knockout (KO) mice surprisingly appeared to have no defects in nuclear speckle assembly or pre-mRNA splicing <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>, raising questions about the extent to which Malat1 contributes to these processes <italic>in vivo</italic>. These unexpected discrepancies of <italic>in vitro</italic> and in vivo studies also draw increasing attention on the importance and necessity of <italic>in vivo</italic> studies to reveal lncRNA function. The homeostatic/physiological function of Malat1 <italic>in vivo</italic> has continued to be an enigma, because the absence of this abundant lncRNA in mice does not seem to exhibit abnormalities <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. However, to the best of our knowledge, there are no studies that have comprehensively characterized bone phenotype of Malat1 KO mice.</p>
<p>Bone is a vital organ, which plays a fundamental role in providing structural support to the body, enabling movement, and protecting many other organs. Bone homeostasis is crucial to the quality of life and overall well-being. Bone homeostasis in adulthood is mainly maintained by an active bone remodeling process, which requires a delicate balance between osteoclast-mediated bone resorption and osteoblast-mediated bone formation. Bone tissues undergo constant remodeling, during which bone resorption and formation are usually coupled to ensure that osteoclast-generated resorption lacunae are filled with new bone produced by osteoblasts. This coordination helps maintain bone homeostasis and also provides a mechanism for adapting the skeleton to environmental changes and repairing bone damage. There exists a variety of crosstalk between two major bone cell types, bone-resorbing osteoclasts and boneforming osteoblasts, as well as other cells. The intricate cellular crosstalk coordinately couples the activities of different cells to maintain bone homeostasis during remodeling <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>. In pathological conditions, bone remodeling is often deregulated, which results in unbalanced bone resorption and formation. For example, excessive osteoclast formation accompanied by extensive bone resorption but with limited bone formation/repair often occurs in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), periodontitis and osteoporosis. On the other hand, excessive bone formation and/or defective bone resorption result in osteopetrosis or osteosclerosis. Notably, unbalanced activities between osteoclasts and osteoblasts in pathological bone remodeling synergize to aggravate the rate and extent of bone damage <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>. Although the importance of bone remodeling is evident to bone homeostasis and health, the coupling and crosstalk mechanisms are complex and far from well understood.</p>
<p>Given the vital importance of bone remodeling to skeletal health and overall well-being, we took advantage of rigorous genetic approaches using global and conditional Malat1 KO mice in this study. Contrary to previously held beliefs that Malat1 had no appreciable phenotype, we uncovered that Malat1 KO mice exhibit a significant osteoporotic bone phenotype characterized by reduced osteoblastic bone formation and enhanced osteoclastic bone resorption <italic>in vivo</italic>. Thus, Malat1 deletion uncoupled the normal bone remodeling process between osteoblasts and osteoclasts. Our data further demonstrate that Malat1 emerges as a novel regulator impacting multiple cell types, including osteoblasts, osteoclasts, and chondrocytes, through the β-catenin-OPG/Jagged1 pathway. This study discovered an important homeostatic function of Malat1, and identified this lncRNA as a previously unrecognized key bone remodeling regulator that controls both bone formation and resorption to maintain bone homeostasis, regeneration and health.</p>

<sec id="s2-1">
<title>Malat1 is a novel lncRNA regulator of bone homeostasis and remodeling</title>
<p>We first performed a series of experiments to comprehensively examine bone mass, bone resorption, bone formation, bone cell changes and bone remodeling by microCT (μCT), bone histology and dynamic histomorphometric analysis. Adult mice with Malat1 deficiency (<italic>Malat1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> on C57BL/6 background) do not show growth retardation or macroscopic differences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Suppl. Fig. 1a</xref>), but exhibit significantly reduced bone mass compared with wild type littermate controls (WT) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig.1a</xref>). μCT analysis showed markedly decreased trabecular bone volume (BV/TV), number (Tb.N.), bone mineral density (BMD) and connectivity density (Conn-Dens.), and increased trabecular spacing (Tb. Sp) in both male and female <italic>Malat1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig.1b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Suppl. Fig. 1b</xref>). Cortical bone appears normal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Suppl. Fig. 1c</xref>). Osteoclastic bone resorption was significantly enhanced in <italic>Malat1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice indicated by the elevated numbers and surfaces of osteoclasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1c, d</xref>). However, osteoblastic bone formation was not accordingly enhanced but instead was dramatically suppressed by Malat1 deficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1e-h</xref>). Bone dynamic histomorphometric analysis by calcein double labeling showed that Malat1 absence notably inhibited both mineral apposition rate (MAR) and bone formation rate (BFR/BS) in <italic>Malat1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1e, f</xref>). Furthermore, osteoblast parameters, such as osteoblast surfaces and numbers, as well as osteoid formed beneath osteoblasts were significantly reduced in <italic>Malat1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig.1g, h</xref>). These results indicate that the lack of Malat1 suppresses osteogenesis and bone formation in mice. Moreover, Malat1 deficiency uncouples osteoclastic bone resorption and osteoblastic bone formation, leading to markedly reduced bone mass. Our data thus identify Malat1 as a novel bone remodeling regulator in bone homeostasis.</p>

<title>Malat1 acts as a cell-intrinsic regulator in osteoblasts to promote bone formation</title>
<p>Next, we examined the role of Malat1 in osteoblastic bone formation.

Malat1 deficiency in osteoblasts significantly decreased trabecular bone volume (BV/TV), number (Tb.N.), thickness (Tb.

There are no obvious changes in cortical bone phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Suppl. Fig. 2</xref>). Furthermore, mineral apposition rate (MAR) and bone formation rate (BFR/BS) were both lower in <italic>Malat1<sup>ΔOcn</sup></italic> mice than the controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2c</xref>). In parallel, Malat1 deficiency in osteoblasts led to decreased osteoblast numbers and surfaces in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2d</xref>). These results indicate that <italic>Malat1<sup>ΔOcn</sup></italic> mice exhibit osteoporotic phenotype with reduced bone formation, which is consistent with <italic>Malat1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice. Therefore, Malat1 is a cell-intrinsic osteogenic regulator that promotes osteoblastic bone formation.</p>

<title>Malatl binds to β-catenin and suppresses its transcriptional activity in osteoblasts</title>
<p>Given these findings, we sought to investigate the mechanisms underlying the regulation of osteoblastic bone formation by Malat1. β-catenin is a central transcriptional factor in canonical Wnt signaling pathway, and plays an important role in positively regulating osteoblast differentiation and function <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>. Upon stimulation, most notably from canonical Wnt ligands, β-catenin is stabilized and translocates into the nucleus, where it interacts with coactivators to activate target gene transcription. Previous reports observed a link between Malat1 and β-catenin signaling pathway in cancers <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>, but the underlying molecular mechanisms in terms of how Malat1 interacts with β-catenin and regulates its nuclear retention and transcriptional activity are unclear. In this study, we performed both Chromatin isolation by RNA purification (ChIRP) assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3a, b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>) and RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3c</xref>) to determine the interaction between Malat1 and β-catenin. The results obtained by these two approaches clearly show that Malat1 binds to β-catenin in osteoblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3a-c</xref>). Next, we asked whether Malat1 regulates β-catenin nuclear translocation in response to Wnt3a. We did not find that Malat1 deficiency significantly affects nuclear localization of β-catenin stimulated by Wnt3a (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3d</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref>). We then performed Luciferase assay to examine whether Malat1 modulates the transcriptional activity of β-catenin. The results showed that Malat1 deficiency significantly reduced the transcriptional activity of β-catenin in response to Wnt3a stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3e</xref>). In line with this, the expression levels of β-catenin target genes, such as <italic>Axin2, Ccnd1, Lef1 and Myc</italic>, were substantially lower in <italic>Malat1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> cells than WT controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3f</xref>). Our findings indicate that Malat1 is a key regulator of Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway that is important for osteoblasts. Since Malat1 is a nuclear lncRNA, these data also suggest that Malat1 acts as a scaffold to tether β-catenin in nuclei to implement its positive regulation of β-catenin activity.</p>

<title>Malat1 inhibits osteoclastogenesis in a non-autonomous manner</title>
<p>As osteoclast formation is significantly increased in <italic>Malat1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice, we examined whether this osteoclast change is due to an intrinsic role of Malat1 in these cells. We first investigated <italic>in vitro</italic> osteoclast differentiation using bone marrow derived macrophages (BMMs) as osteoclast precursors. Surprisingly, there is no significant difference in osteoclast differentiation and mineral resorption between WT and <italic>Malat1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> BMM cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4a, b</xref>), which is inconsistent with the <italic>in vivo</italic> data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1c</xref>).

<title>Malat1 couples osteoblast-osteoclast crosstalk via β-catenin-OPG axis</title>
<p>It is intriguing how Malat1 regulates osteoclastogenesis. We first looked at osteoclast phenotype in <italic>Malat1<sup>ΔOcn</sup></italic> mice, and found that Malat1 deletion in osteoblasts significantly enhanced osteoclast numbers and surfaces <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5a</xref>). This finding indicates that Malat1 affects osteoclast formation through crosstalk between osteoblasts and osteoclasts. To further explore the underlying mechanisms of this crosstalk, we took advantage of a well-established co-culture system <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup> with primary osteoblasts in a transwell and bone marrow cells on the bottom of the dish. RANKL and M-CSF secreted by osteoblasts induced osteoclast differentiation on the bottom (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5b</xref>). Interestingly, we found that more osteoclasts formed in the co-cultures with <italic>Malat1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> osteoblasts than WT osteoblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5b</xref>). The results of this co-culture system recapitulate the <italic>in vivo</italic> enhanced osteoclast phenotype, and indicates that certain soluble factors secreted from osteoblasts are highly likely involved in the Malat1 regulation of osteoclastogenesis. Since we found that Malat1 binds to β-catenin to regulate its target genes, we primarily searched β-catenin target genes that function as secreted factors. Osteoprotegerin (OPG), encoded by <italic>Tnfrsf11b</italic>, is a β-catenin target <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>. OPG is a secreted factor that acts as a RANKL decoy receptor to block RANKL activity, thereby suppressing osteoclast formation and bone resorption <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>. We found that OPG expression was markedly lower in the <italic>Malat1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> osteoblasts than the WT control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5c</xref>). RANKL-OPG axis is a typical bone remodeling mediator through impacting osteoclastogenesis, and RANKL/OPG ratio is usually an indicator for osteoclastogenic/bone resorption potential and status <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>. Our results showed that OPG but not RANKL was down-regulated in <italic>Malat1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> osteoblasts, leading to a higher RANKL/OPG ratio in <italic>Malat1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> osteoblasts than WT controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5d, e</xref>). The elevated RANKL/OPG ratio in <italic>Malat1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> osteoblasts favors enhanced osteoclastogenesis, which is aligned with the enhanced osteoclast formation and decreased bone mass in <italic>Malat1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice. We next examined the OPG expression <italic>in vivo</italic>. Recent literature demonstrates that locally produced OPG in bone, but not the serum OPG, is a critical inhibitor of osteoclast formation and bone resorption <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>. Indeed, the OPG level in serum in <italic>Malat1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice is similar to that in WT controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5f</xref>). However, OPG level in bone marrow was drastically decreased in <italic>Malat1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice compared to WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5g</xref>). We further tested the importance of the decreased OPG level in the Malat1 regulation of osteoclasts. We applied two well-established <italic>ex vivo</italic> culture systems to closely recapitulate in vivo conditions. In the whole bone marrow cultures with M-CSF and RANKL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5h</xref>), Malat1 deletion in <italic>Malat1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> bone marrow enabled more osteoclastogenesis than WT bone marrow, which is consistent with the <italic>in vivo</italic> findings. When recombinant OPG was added to the bone marrow cultures, the osteoclast formation in both WT and <italic>Malat1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> cultures was inhibited as expected, but the osteoclast formation in <italic>Malat1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> bone marrow with additional OPG became similar to that in the WT control cultures without additional OPG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5h</xref> column 1 vs 4). In another co-culture system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5i</xref>), WT or <italic>Malat1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> osteoblasts were co-cultured with WT bone marrow in the presence of 1,25(OH)2-vitD3 and PGE2. The RANKL secreted from osteoblasts induces osteoclast formation in this co-culture system. Furthermore, because these cultures included the same WT bone marrow cells but different osteoblasts from WT or <italic>Malat1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice, the results directly reflected osteoblastic Malat1 effects on osteoclast formation. In this co-culture system, we observed a similar phenotype as that in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5h</xref>. Extra OPG can lead to osteoclast formation in <italic>Malat1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> osteoblasts and WT bone marrow cocultures comparable to that in WT osteoblasts and WT bone marrow cocultures without extra OPG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5i</xref> column 1 vs 4). These results collectively support that the decreased OPG level in <italic>Malat1</italic> deficient osteoblasts plays a significant role in the excessive osteoclast formation in <italic>Malat1<sup>-/-</sup>’</italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1c, d</xref>) and <italic>Malat1<sup>ΔOcn</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5a</xref>), as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7</xref>.</p>

<title>Malat1 positively regulates the production of β-catenin targets, OPG and Jagged1, from chondrocytes</title>
<p>As OPG is a key osteoclastic inhibitor, we asked whether other cells, in addition to osteoblasts, in bone marrow could also produce OPG, which we have established is regulated by Malat1. We analyzed a bone scRNAseq dataset (GSE128423) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>.

Moreover, OPG expression level in <italic>Malat1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> chondrocytes was approximately 50% less compared to that in WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6f, g</xref>). RANKL (encoded by <italic>Tnfsf11</italic>) is nearly undetectable in chondrocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6f</xref>).

<p>We next examined whether Malat1 also modulates β-catenin activity in chondrocytes. In addition to OPG, we observed that the expression of other β-catenin target genes, such as <italic>Tcf7</italic>, <italic>Lef1</italic> and <italic>Jag1</italic>, was approximately 50% lower in <italic>Malat1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> chondrocytes than that in WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6h</xref>). This suggests that, similar to osteoblasts, Malat1 positively regulates β-catenin activity in chondrocytes. The decreased expression of Jagged1 in <italic>Malat1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> chondrocytes drew our attention, as Jagged1 is not only a Notch ligand <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup> but also an inhibitor of osteoclastogenesis <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup>. Following this observation, we evaluated the protein expression levels of Jagged1, and found that Malat1 deficiency drastically decreased Jagged1 protein expression in chondrocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6i</xref>). These results collectively indicate that the decreased OPG and Jagged1 production in <italic>Malat1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> chondrocytes also contributes to the enhanced osteoclast formation and low bone mass in <italic>Malat1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Malat1 stands out as one of the most abundant and evolutionarily conserved long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs). Initially, the lack of evident defects in Malat1 knockout (KO) mice led to the assumption that Malat1 might not be essential for development and physiological processes. However, previous phenotyping studies did not encompass the examination of bone, a vital yet often overlooked organ. Despite its appearance as a hard tissue, bone undergoes continuous remodeling involving various cell types to maintain its mass and function. In this study, we investigated the function of Malat1 in bone. Our results revealed that Malat1 acts as a crucial player through the concerted actions of multiple bone cells via a new molecular network in the intricate regulation of bone homeostasis and remodeling under physiological conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7</xref>). In pathological conditions, such as fracture healing, Malat1 is an important regulator that promotes bone regeneration. These findings exemplify the unprecedented key role of lncRNAs, like Malat1, in tissue homeostasis and remodeling, shedding light on their broader significance in orchestrating cellular and molecular networks for maintaining and adapting tissue homeostasis and regeneration.</p>
<p>During the submission of our manuscript, another group <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup> reported that Malat1 KO mice show reduced bone mass, which is the only similar phenotype as observed in our study. However, there are many novel findings that are distinct in our study. In addition to global Malat1 KO mice, we generated both osteoblast and osteoclast specific Malat1 conditional KO mouse lines. Using the osteoblast-specific conditional KO mice (<italic>Malat1<sup>ΔOcn</sup></italic>), we demonstrate that Malat1 promotes bone formation in osteoblasts. Using the myeloid osteoclast-specific mice (<italic>Malat1<sup>ΔM/ΔM</sup></italic>), we demonstrate that Malat1 does not directly affect osteoclastogenesis, but suppresses osteoclastogenesis in a non-autonomous manner in vivo by integrating crosstalk between multiple cell types, including osteoblasts, osteoclasts and chondrocytes. We further found that Malat1 binds to β-catenin and functions through the β-catenin-OPG/Jagged1 pathway in osteoblasts and chondrocytes to enhance bone formation and suppress bone resorption (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7</xref>). Moreover, Malat1 significantly promotes bone regeneration in fracture healing. Taken together, these findings, including the cellular and molecular mechanisms as well as the healing model, are novel and not reported before.</p>
<p>Fine-tuning in biology is essential for maintaining homeostasis <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup>. Bone must adapt to various environmental changes, ensure optimal function, and respond effectively and precisely to internal and external signals. In this study, we found that Malat1 is a central player in finetuning bone homeostasis and remodeling. Malat1 promotes osteoblastic bone formation. It also orchestrates the β-catenin pathway to activate the downstream target genes, OPG and Jagged1, which are potent osteoclastogenic inhibitors. Interestingly, Malat1 does not directly affect osteoclastogenesis in osteoclast cell lineage. The regulation of OPG and Jagged1 by Malat1 occurs in osteoblasts and chondrocytes. Malat1 alters the expression of OPG and Jagged1 in these cells, thereby impacting osteoclastogenesis in a non-autonomous manner. Therefore, Malat1 impacts not only one cell type but fine-tunes a complex cellular and molecular network in the skeletal system. In this network, OPG and Jagged1 are newly identified targets regulated by Malat1. Although previous reports observed a link between Malat1 and β-catenin signaling pathway in cancers <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>, the underlying molecular mechanisms were unclear. Specifically, it is poorly understood how Malat1 interacts with β-catenin and regulates its nuclear retention and transcriptional activity. Our studies elucidated these questions and uncovered the molecular basis of the Malat1- β-catenin pathway. With consideration that lncRNAs can utilize diverse molecular mechanisms, Malat1 may also bind to additional regulators. Future studies may involve ChIRP assays followed by mass spectrometric analysis to identify additional potential Malat1-bound targets.</p>
<p>While studies on lncRNAs using <italic>in vivo</italic> genetic approaches are increasing, many lncRNA investigations still rely heavily on <italic>in vitro</italic> methods, such as RNAi techniques for a knockdown in cell cultures. While a knockdown model has the advantage of facilitating high-throughput screens, emerging evidence has revealed significant non-specific or off-target effects <italic>in vitro</italic>. This has caused subsequent mischaracterizations of lncRNA functions and their respective mechanisms. This is particularly concerning for abundant nuclear lncRNAs, such as Malat1. Additional concerns include the transient knockdown effects <italic>in vitro</italic> versus the stable knockout effects <italic>in vivo</italic>. The definitive evidence of functionality comes from genetic knockouts, enabling the examination of <italic>in vivo</italic> function and minimizing the risk of off-target effects. Controversial reports exist between <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> studies regarding Malat1’s function in nuclear speckles and cancers <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref></sup>. Recently, some <italic>in vitro</italic> studies suggested that Malat1 acts as a miRNA sponge <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref></sup>. However, miRNAs are primarily located in the cytoplasm and lncRNA-miRNA interaction occurs almost exclusively in this cellular compartment. Given Malat1’s nuclear localization, it is unlikely to function as an ‘miRNA sponge’. At least, the location of the potential interaction between Malat1 and miRNAs, as well as the Malat1 copies in extra-nuclear compartments, need to be definitively verified using robust approaches. Current reports on Malat1’s functions in bone cells have similar concerns with their in vitro approaches <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref></sup>. Overall, the distinct results obtained from <italic>in vitro</italic> knockdown systems and <italic>in vivo</italic> Malat1 knockout mouse models provide a clear example of the limitations of <italic>in vitro</italic> knockdown systems for annotating lncRNA function <italic>in vivo</italic>. Therefore, discussions in the lncRNA field have emphasized the robustness of approaches, and highlighted the critical need to apply genetic methods aptly to confidently characterize lncRNA functions <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup>. This is especially relevant in <italic>in vivo</italic> contexts such as development, metabolism, homeostasis, and tissue remodeling. The <italic>Malat1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup> used in this study were generated by inserting beta-galactosidase gene followed by a polyadenylation signal immediately downstream from the transcriptional start site of <italic>Malat1</italic>. This strategy preserves DNA regulatory elements at the <italic>Malat1</italic> locus, thereby avoiding confusion in result interpretation arising from the loss of these elements.</p>
<p>A challenge in lncRNA field is the unclear structures of most lncRNAs. The size of lncRNAs typically spans from 1kb to over 100kb. These molecules exhibit intricate secondary and tertiary structures that become increasingly dynamic and complex based on their interactions with various proteins. The structural flexibility of lncRNAs in diverse cellular contexts poses a more significant challenge in deciphering the relationship between their structure and function <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. For instance, in a model of estimating lncRNA structures, approximately half of Malat1 nucleotides were found to adopt various structures, including nearly 200 helices, many pseudoknots, structured tetraloops, internal loops, and intricate intramolecular long-range interactions featuring multiway junctions <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref></sup>. To unravel these complexities, breakthrough techniques are required to understand the functions of each and all of the dynamic structures of lncRNAs.</p>
<p>Many skeletal diseases involve defects in bone remodeling, a process that includes multiple cell types, cellular crosstalk, and complex molecular pathways. Treatment efficacy is usually insufficient by targeting only one bone cell type. This is clearly evident in diseases such as RA and periodontitis, in which standard antiresorptive therapies, such as bisphosphonates that inhibit osteoclast activity, are not able to effectively restore bone formation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>. Therefore, there is a clinical need for new or complementary therapies that can target multiple bone cell types, such as osteoblasts and osteoclasts. These innovative therapeutic strategies go beyond targeting a single cell type, aiming instead to restore healthy bone remodeling and significantly enhance treatment efficacy. Malat1, identified in this study, emerges as a crucial fine-tuner that integrates multiple bone cells and a molecular network to maintain bone homeostasis. Thus, Malat1 and its mediated cellular and molecular mechanisms not only hold significant implications for our understanding of conditions related to bone health but also offer a potential avenue for developing more efficient treatments for bone diseases.</p>

<title>Bone fracture model</title>
<p>Bone fracture was performed as described previously with slight modifications <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup>. 13-week-old mice were anesthetized with 2.5% isoflurane via inhalation. The mice received meloxicam (subcutaneous injection, 2 mg/kg) and buprenorphine (subcutaneous injection, 0.5mg/kg) as analgesia prior to surgery. The surgical site was shaved and sterilized using iodine and 70% ethanol. An incision was made over the anterolateral femur. 0.1 ml bupivacaine (5mg/ml) was injected into the tissue adjacent to the incision line. A 25-gauge needle was inserted into the femoral canal through the patellar groove. The mid-diaphysis of the femur was transected using dental drill with a burr (19007-05, Fine science tools). The needle was then trimmed from the distal end to prevent it from projecting into the femoral joint space. The left part of the needle remained in femur to stabilize the fracture. The muscle was repositioned over the injury site and stitched using absorbable sutures. The skin was closed with wound clips, which were removed 2 weeks post-surgery. Animals were administered 0.5mg/kg buprenorphine every 12 hours and 2.0 mg/kg meloxicam every 24 hours subcutaneously for analgesia up to 3 days after the surgery.

We followed ATCC handling information to maintain and culture the cells. Briefly, the cells were maintained in DMEM medium supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% Penicillin—Streptomycin and 0.4 mg/ml G-418. To produce the Wnt3a conditioned medium (Wnt3a CM) and control medium (L CM), the cultured cells (80–90% confluence) from one 10cm dish were split at a 1:10 ratio and seeded into 10 cm tissue culture dishes. After an initial 4-day culture (approximately to confluency) in DMEM medium containing 10% FBS and 1% Penicillin—Streptomycin, the first batch of medium was harvested. Subsequently, 10 ml of fresh medium was added, and the cells were cultured for another 3 days to collect the second batch of conditioned medium. The two batches of conditioned media were combined at a 1:1 ratio, filtered using a 0.22 μm filter, and stored at -80°C. Wnt3a activity was confirmed by nuclear translocation of β-catenin.</p>

The bound proteins were eluted by boiling the beads in 30ul of 3x blue juice buffer (150 mM Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 6% SDS, 30% glycerol, and 0.03% Bromophenol Blue, with fresh 10% 2-Mercaptoethanol) and subjected to immunoblot analysis.</p>

<title>Luciferase reporter assay</title>
<p>3.5x10<sup>4</sup> of primary calvarial osteoblasts were plated in 48-well plates. Next day, 480 ng of the M50 Super 8x TOPFlash plasmid (12456, Addgene) and 20ng of pRL-Tk control plasmid (E2241, Promega) were transfected per well using Lipofectamine 3000 (L3000001, Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. After 24h transfection, the culture medium was replaced with fresh αMEM medium supplemented with 10%FBS. 48h post transfection, the cells were serum starved for 1h and then treated with 20% L- or 20% Wnt3a CM for 16h. Firefly and Renilla luciferase activities were measured using a Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay system (E1910, Promega) on a Gen5 Microplate Reader (BioTek) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Firefly luciferase activity was normalized to Renilla luciferase activity.</p>

<title>Single cell RNAseq (scRNAseq) Analysis</title>
<p>Single cell RNAseq datasets for bone (GSM3674239, GSM3674240, GSM3674241, GSM3674242) and bone marrow (GSM3674243, GSM3674244, GSM3674246) were downloaded from GSE128423 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>. Seurat package <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref></sup> was applied for downstream analysis. Briefly, genes expressed in fewer than 3 cells and cells with less than 500 genes were filtered out. Cells with over 10% mitochondrial reads and exceeding 6,000 nFeature_RNA were excluded. After NormalizeData, the top 5000 variable genes were selected based on dispersion method using FindVariableGenes function of Seurat package. Subsequently, data scaling was performed using the ScaleData function. All datasets were integrated based on the identified anchors. The first 30 principal components for both UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection) and the subsequent application of a graph-based clustering approach were used, with resolution at 0.1. The Clustree function was executed to understand how the structure of clusters changes across different resolutions. The FindAllMarkers function was utilized with parameters set to prioritizing positive markers expressed in at least 10% of cells within a cluster and exhibiting a log-fold change threshold of 0.25. The following gene markers were also included for cluster annotation: <italic>Acan, Col2a1 and Sox9</italic> for chondrocytes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>; <italic>Acta2, Myh11</italic> and <italic>Mcam</italic> for pericytes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>; <italic>Adipoq, Lepr, Cxcl12, Cebpa, Kitl</italic> and <italic>Lpl</italic> for Adipoq-lineage progenitors <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref></sup>; <italic>Prrx1, Col1a1, Ibsp</italic> and <italic>Bglap</italic> for osteoblast lineage <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref></sup>; <italic>Pecam1</italic> and <italic>Cdh5</italic> for endothelial cells <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref></sup>; <italic>Cd19</italic> for B cells <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref></sup>; <italic>S100a8</italic> for neutrophils <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref></sup>; <italic>Mpz, Mbp</italic> and <italic>Plp1</italic> for Schwann cells <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref></sup>; <italic>Gypa, Alas2, Snca, Hbb-bs, Hbb-bt, Car1, Car2, Klf1, Gata1</italic> and <italic>Gata2</italic> for Erythroid cells <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref></sup>; <italic>Pf4, Itga2b</italic> and <italic>Fli1</italic> for Megakaryocytes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref></sup>; <italic>Cd68, Lyz2, Ly6c2</italic> and <italic>Sell</italic> for Monocyte-Macrophage lineage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref></sup>. We utilized Seurat’s FeaturePlot to visualize gene expression in individual cells. DotPlot was employed to illustrate the percentage of cells in a cluster expressing a specific gene and to visualize the average scaled expression level of each gene. The distribution of normalized gene expression levels across all cells in each cluster was visualized using VlnPlot function in Seurat. R version 4.3.2 and Seurat 5.0.1 were used in the study.</p>

<p>The work is <bold>important</bold> and of potential value to areas other than the bone field because it supports a role and mechanism for beta-catenin that is novel and unusual. The findings are significant in that they support the presence of another anabolic pathway in bone that can be productively targeted for therapeutic goals. The data for the most part are <bold>convincing</bold>. The work could be strengthened by better characterizing the osteoclast KO of Malat1 related to the Lys cre model and by including biochemical markers of bone turnover from the mice.</p>

<p>Summary</p>
<p>The authors were trying to discover a novel bone remodeling network system. They found that an IncRNA Malat1 plays a central role in the remodeling by binding to β-catenin and functioning through the β-catenin-OPG/Jagged1 pathway in osteoblasts and chondrocytes. In addition, Malat1 significantly promotes bone regeneration in fracture healing in vivo. Their findings suggest a new concept of Malat1 function in the skeletal system. One significantly different finding between this manuscript and the competing paper pertains to the role of Malat1 in osteoclast lineage, specifically, whether Malat1 functions intrinsically in osteoclast lineage or not.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This study provides strong genetic evidence demonstrating that Malat1 acts intrinsically in osteoblasts while suppressing osteoclastogenesis in a non-autonomous manner, whereas the other group did not utilize relevant conditional knockout mice. As shown in the results, Malat1 knockout mouse exhibited abnormal bone remodeling and turnover. Furthermore, they elucidated molecular function of Malat1, which is sufficient to understand the phenotype in vivo.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Discussing differences between previous paper and their status would be highly informative and beneficial for the field, as it would elucidate the solid underlying mechanisms.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors investigated the roles of IncRNA Malat1 in bone homeostasis which was initially believed to be non-functional for physiology. They found that both Malat1 KO and conditional KO in osteoblast lineage exhibit significant osteoporosis due to decreased osteoblast bone formation and increased osteoclast resorption. More interestingly they found that deletion of Malat1 in osteoclast lineage cells does not affect osteoclast differentiation and function. Mechanistically, they found that Malat1 acts as a co-activator of b-Catenin directly regulating osteoblast activity and indirectly regulating osteoclast activity via mediating OPG, but not RANKL expression in osteoblast and chondrocyte. Their discoveries establish a previously unrecognized paradigm model of Malat1 function in the skeletal system, providing novel mechanistic insights into how a lncRNA integrates cellular crosstalk and molecular networks to fine-tune tissue homeostasis, and remodeling.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors generated global and conditional KO mice in osteoblast and osteoclast lineage cells and carefully analyzed the role of Matat1 with both in vivo and in vitro systems. The conclusion of this paper is mostly well supported by data.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>More objective biological and biochemical analyses are required.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this manuscript, Qin and colleagues study the role of Malat1 in bone biology. This topic is interesting given the role of lncRNAs in multiple physiologic processes. A previous study (PMID 38493144) suggested a role for Malat1 in osteoclast maturation. However, the role of this lncRNA in osteoblast biology was previously not explored. Here, the authors note osteopenia with increased bone resorption in mice lacking Malat1 globally and in osteoblast lineage cells. At the mechanistic level, the authors suggest that Malat1 controls beta-catenin activity. These results advance the field regarding the role of this lncRNA in bone biology.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The manuscript is well-written and data are presented in a clear and easily understandable manner. The bone phenotype of osteoblast-specific Malat1 knockout mice is of high interest. The role of Malat1 in controlling beta-catenin activity and OPG expression is interesting and novel.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The lack of a bone phenotype when Malat1 is deleted with LysM-Cre is of interest given the previous report suggesting a role for this lncRNA in osteoclasts. However, to interpret the findings here, the authors should investigate the deletion efficiency of Malat1 in osteoclast lineage cells in their model. The data in the fracture model in Figure 8 seems incomplete in the absence of a more complete characterization of callus histology and a thorough time course. The role of Malat1 and OPG in chondrocytes is unclear since the osteocalcin-Cre mice (which should retain normal Malat1 levels in chondrocytes) have similar bone loss as the global mutants.</p>
