<title>Abstract</title>
<p>The unfolded protein response (UPR) is a crucial signaling network that preserves endoplasmic reticulum (ER) homeostasis, impacting both health and disease. When ER stress occurs, often due to an accumulation of unfolded proteins in the ER lumen, the UPR initiates a broad cellular program to counteract cytotoxic effects. Inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1), a conserved ER-bound protein, is a key sensor of ER stress and activator of the UPR. While biochemical studies confirm IRE1’s role in recognizing unfolded polypeptides, high-resolution structures showing direct interactions remain elusive. Consequently, the precise structural mechanism by which IRE1 senses unfolded proteins is debated. In this study, we employed advanced molecular modeling and extensive atomistic molecular dynamics simulations to clarify how IRE1 detects unfolded proteins. Our results demonstrate that IRE1’s luminal domain directly interacts with unfolded peptides and reveal how these interactions can stabilize higher-order oligomers. We provide a detailed molecular characterization of unfolded peptide binding, identifying two distinct binding pockets at the dimer’s center, separate from its central groove. Furthermore, we present high-resolution structures illustrating how BiP associates with IRE1’s oligomeric interface, thus preventing the formation of larger complexes. Our structural model reconciles seemingly contradictory experimental findings, offering a unified perspective on the diverse sensing models proposed. Ultimately, we elucidate the structural dynamics of unfolded protein sensing by IRE1, providing key insights into the initial activation of the UPR.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is central for protein folding, maturation, and delivery of membrane and secreted proteins in eukaryotic cells. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup> The lumen of the ER presents unique features, such as high calcium ion concentration, <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup> oxidizing redox potential,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup> and a high number of chaperones.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup> These unique features must be preserved to ensure correct protein production. Loss of ER homeostasis can lead to the accumulation of unfolded and misfolded proteins, a phenomenon known as ER stress.</p>
<p>The Unfolded Protein Response (UPR) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup> is a collection of signaling pathways that allows eukaryotic cells to counteract ER stress. The membrane protein inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1) is UPR’s central transducer in all eukaryotes and the most evolutionarily conserved branch of the UPR.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup> It activates its signaling pathway by forming oligomers and large supra-molecular assemblies. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup> IRE1 is a single-pass transmembrane protein and can sense the unfolded protein load of the ER lumen through its core luminal domain (cLD).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup> Accumulation of unfolded proteins in the ER promotes the formation of multimeric assemblies, allowing the cytosolic kinase domains to trans-phosphorylate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup> and activate the RNAse domains. This, in turn, initiates splicing of <italic>XBP1</italic> mRNA, which encodes for a transcription factor, <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup> leading to the transcription of UPR target genes. In addition, the active RNase initiates mRNA decay.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup> The UPR aims at restoring ER homeostasis and when stress is not mitigated in a timely manner, the UPR triggers cell death via apoptosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup> Chronic ER stress has been implicated in various diseases, from diabetes to cancer.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup> Thus, maintaining the folding equilibrium in the ER is crucial for the proper functioning and viability of eukaryotic cells.</p>
<p>The cLD initiates IRE1’s activation, yet the mechanism by which it detects the accumulation of misfolded proteins remains debated. Two main models have been proposed, which differ in whether the cLD senses unfolded proteins directly or indirectly.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup> In the direct binding model, IRE1’s cLD interacts directly with unfolded proteins, triggering assembly and activation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup> Observations that the crystal structure of the cLD dimer <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup> of <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> (yIre1) presents a groove in the central area that resembles the major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) peptide-binding cleft <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup> have led to the hypothesis that IRE1 uses a mechanism for unfolded peptide binding similar to the antigen-presenting protein. Subsequently, the binding of unfolded peptides to the yIre1 cLD was demonstrated in vitro and in cells. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup> According to this hypothesis, the peptides bind to the groove delimited by the two monomers’ helices at the center of the dimer, spanning the dimeric interface. However, the structure of human IRE1 ubiquitous isoform <italic>α</italic> (hIRE1<italic>α</italic>) cLD dimer features a narrower cleft than the yeast Ire1 cLD. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup> These observations inspired the hypothesis that the conformation observed in yeast represents an ‘open’ state of the dimer, whereas the crystal structure of human cLD represents a ‘closed’ dimer state that requires opening to accommodate peptides. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup> Recently, evidence of direct binding of unfolded polypeptides to the human IRE1<italic>α</italic> cLD central groove accumulated,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup> indicating that this domain preferably binds peptides enriched in aromatics, hydrophobics, and arginine residues. Moreover, new experiments showed that the human IRE1 already forms dimers in non-stress conditions,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup> suggesting that peptides might bind preexisting dimers and induce oligomerization required for the subsequent activation of the sensor. Despite this evidence, we still lack a clear structural understanding of the direct sensing model and how the binding of unfolded peptides promotes the formation of higher-order assemblies.</p>
<p>In the indirect activation model, BiP, a chaperone of the Hsp70 family in the ER lumen, mediates interactions with unfolded proteins.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup> In this scenario, BiP binds to IRE1, preventing it from forming dimers and oligomers in the absence of stress. At the onset of ER stress, BiP binds to accumulating unfolded proteins, leaving IRE1 free to self-associate and start the UPR signaling cascade. BiP could bind to IRE1 either via its ATPase domain or substrate-binding domain (SBD). <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup> Interaction through the substrate domain would hint at a direct competition between IRE1 and unfolded proteins while binding through the nuclease domain supports an allosteric mechanism.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup> Moreover, BiP binds to regions of IRE1, which are disordered and part of the oligomerization interface.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup></p>
<p>In recent years, the field has been converging towards integrating the direct and indirect binding models, where unfolded proteins and BiP interaction with cLD both regulate IRE1.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup> We aimed to integrate evidence about the human IRE1<italic>α</italic> cLD early activation phase to develop a structural understanding of this protein domain’s sensing mechanism.</p>
<p>Here, we performed multi-microsecond equilibrium atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to investigate the stability of the human IRE1<italic>α</italic> cLD dimer, its structural features, and its interaction with unfolded polypeptides and BiP. By integrating the crystal structure with Alphafold Multimer <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup> prediction, we identified the <italic>β</italic>-sheet interface as well as hydrophobic side chains orientation as the key elements of a stable dimer. Comparison of the dynamics of yeast and human cLD dimer highlighted differences suggesting alternative stress sensing strategies. Our simulations provided structural evidence that unfolded polypeptides bind directly to the center of the human IRE1<italic>α</italic> cLD dimer, reinforcing their crucial role in cluster formation during the initial phases of ER stress. Additionally, we provide structural evidence supporting a model in which hIRE1<italic>α</italic> cLD is bound to BiP at the oligomeric interface, inhibiting cluster formation while allowing dimer formation.</p>

<title>The hIRE1<italic>α</italic> cLD forms a stable dimer</title>
<p>An accurate determination of proteins’ structural dynamics is crucial to understanding their function. MD simulations use the laws of physics to simulate the movements of atoms in a protein, generating a trajectory, a “movie” showing how its structure changes in time. The trajectory can reveal conformational changes, alternative structural organizations, and their relative stability. MD simulations of multiple molecules can reveal how they interact and whether they form stable assemblies. MD simulations require an initial structural model to start generating a trajectory. The human IRE1<italic>α</italic> core luminal domain (cLD) structure has been resolved by X-ray crystallography and deposited in the Protein Data Bank as a symmetric homodimer (PDB ID 2HZ6<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>). This structure lacks residues in two disordered regions: DR1 (residues L131-S152) and DR2 (residues P308-N357). We used protein sequence information and modeled these gaps as unstructured loops, obtaining the “PDB model” (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>, modeled regions are DR1 in cyan and DR2 in orange). Despite its relatively high resolution of 3.10 Å, the PDB structure shows low percentile scores in the wwPDB (Worldwide Protein Data Bank) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup> validation report for global metrics, including torsion angle outliers (Ramachandran and sidechain) and quality of fit (RSRZ outliers). Notably, the PDB dimeric assembly was derived from the crystal packing of the asymmetric unit of the crystal, which includes only one monomer.</p>

<p>We generated an alternative cLD dimer structure using AlphaFold 2 Multimer, <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup> termed the “AF model” (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>). The PDB and AF models were similar, with an RMSD of 3.34 Å (aligned on the <italic>β</italic>-sheet floor, excluding DR1 and DR2) (Supplementary Fig. 7A). Notable structural features (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A-B</xref>) include the dimer interface (green), where the two monomers establish contacts through an antiparallel <italic>β</italic>-sheet interaction that determines the cyclic C2 symmetry of the dimer; the MHC-like groove delimited by <italic>α</italic>A-helices (blue), and the eight-stranded <italic>β</italic>-sheet floor. AlphaFold captured these features while revealing slight structural differences: DR1 was partly predicted as a <italic>β</italic>-hairpin rather than disordered (cyan), and DR2 (orange) featured an <italic>α</italic>-helix (K349-L361). Additionally, the <italic>α</italic>B-helices (violet) were shorter in the AF model than in the PDB model. The discrepancies in these regions were intriguing as the disordered regions are difficult to study experimentally and might contain transient secondary structures. At the same time, the <italic>α</italic>B-helices are involved in the formation of a dimer-dimer interface.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup> A comparison between the AlphaFold 2 and AlphaFold 3 predictions provided a very similar hIRE1<italic>α</italic> cLD dimer model (Supplementary Fig. 7B).</p>
<p>Current all-atom force fields used in MD simulations, like CHARMM,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup> are mainly designed to reproduce the dynamics of folded and globular proteins.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup> They struggle to accurately simulate the structural ensemble of disordered proteins and regions, usually describing structural ensembles that are excessively compact. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup> One culprit is the commonly used water model called TIP3P,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup> which tends to underestimate London dispersion interactions significantly. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup> We, therefore, chose to perform our MD simulations of the two cLD dimer models using TIP3P and TIP4P-D water models in the CHARMM36m force field. The TIP4P-D water model has been developed to alleviate the pitfalls of currently available force fields in reproducing the correct structural ensemble of disordered proteins and regions and is characterized by increased dispersion interactions and slightly stronger electrostatic interaction to achieve a better balance between water dispersion and electrostatic interactions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup> Using TIP4P-D, we aimed to better sample the disordered regions DR1 and DR2 compared to TIP3P.</p>
<p>During our 2 µs-long simulations, the AF and PDB models of the dimer always remained stable, even if the PDB model presented some instabilities in one of the central hydrogen bonds (Supplementary Fig 7C-F). An early PDB model with incorrect side chain orientations in residues L116 and Y166 caused the dimer to dissociate in one-third of the replicas (Supplementary Fig. 7G-H). The proximity of these residues to W125 and P108, essential for dimer formation, <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup> highlights the importance of hydrophobic residues in stabilizing the dimer interface. The final PDB model was stable in simulations in both TIP3P and TIP4P-D water. While modeling missing regions carries inherent risks, it highlighted the critical roles of L116 and Y166 and the value of testing alternative models. The AF model showed high stability of the dimer interface, and the DR1 fold might contribute to this stabilization. Consequently, we modified the AF model by substituting DR1 with an unfolded loop (Supplementary Fig. 7I). We observed no differences in the stability of the dimer interface, concluding that the DR1 <italic>β</italic>-hairpin fold does not contribute to dimer stability. In summary, we modeled the human IRE1<italic>α</italic> cLD dimer by complementing the crystal structure with disordered regions and utilizing structure prediction for an alternative model. Our simulations showed that the dimers remained consistently stable, agreeing with recent experimental results suggesting the IRE1<italic>α</italic> might constitutively be in a dimer organization even in the absence of stress.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup></p>

<title>Hydrogen-deuterium exchange experimental data validate the cLD dimer structure</title>
<p>The two models of human IRE1<italic>α</italic> cLD dimer exhibited structural differences in certain regions, showing variations in secondary structures and flexibilities. Furthermore, the two distinct water models used, TIP3P and TIP4PD, led to differences in flexibility observed for the same structural model. Therefore, we aimed to validate our models by comparing them with experimental data. In the study by Amin-Wetzel et al., <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup> the authors published the results of HDX-MS (hydrogen(<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>H)-deuterium(<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>H) exchange mass spectrometry) experiments on the human IRE1<italic>α</italic> luminal domain. In HDX-MS experiments, a protein is incubated in a deuterated buffer, permitting the amide <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>H from the protein backbone to exchange with <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>H from the solution. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup> The exchange rate is influenced by the exposure of the backbone hydrogen to the aqueous environment, determined by the amino acid sequence’s chemical nature, the protein’s folded state, and its dynamic rearrangements and flexibility. A hydrogen atom in a folded region of the protein will be less likely to exchange than one in an unstructured region. After incubating the protein in solution for a designated period, it is enzymatically digested, and the deuterium uptake of each fragment is assessed through mass spectrometry. These experiments provide insights into the flexibility and solvent accessibility of the protein regions. Specifically, the measured deuterated fraction of a peptide correlates with the flexibility of the corresponding protein region and is inversely related to its folded structure. From our simulations, we calculated the theoretical deuterated fraction using the method by Bradshaw et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup> and compared it to the experimental data (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C-D</xref> and Supplementary Fig. 8A-D). By juxtaposing the experimental data with the results from our PDB and AF models, we can confirm the accuracy of each model.</p>
<p>Both structural dimer models agree well with the HDX-MS data (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>), even though only a mixture of the two models could recapitulate the experimental data entirely (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref> and Supplementary Fig. 8A). The prediction of the deuterated fraction for DR1 based on the PDB model aligns most closely with experimental data. This suggests that DR1 is disordered, contrary to the folding predictions made by the AF model. The dimeric interface was most accurately represented by the AF model, suggesting that the stable dimeric conformation could be constitutive under experimental conditions. The dimeric interface of the PDB model had a predicted deuterated fraction higher than the experimental one, indicating a region that is more water-accessible and flexible than expected. This corresponds to the instability of one H-bond observed in simulations and mentioned earlier (Supplementary Fig. 7E-F), likely due to a suboptimal interface in the dimer of Zhou et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup> On the other hand, the AF model has a better-formed interface due to optimization by AlphaFold, and the hydrogen bonds were stable throughout all simulations.

This result indicates that the region is slightly more structured and less flexible during simulations than expected.

<p>Overall, different protein regions are best represented by different protein models (Supplementary Fig. 8B-D). However, the AF model has the most stable dimeric interface, and in TIP4P-D water, it produces the highest number of deuterated fractions closer to the experimental ones (Supplementary Fig. 8B-C).

<title>The putative groove of human IRE<italic>α</italic> cLD is dynamic but unable to contain peptides</title>
<p>The fact that the Ire1 cLD dimer closely resembles the peptide-binding groove in the MHC-I, in which peptides nestle into a central cleft, suggested a model for interactions of unfolded proteins and Ire1 in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>. However, Zhou et al. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup> argued that the human conformation of the dimer has a groove that is too narrow to accommodate peptides. Indeed, the groove width varies significantly between the two structures in the Protein Data Bank: the groove width is 6.8 Å in hIRE1<italic>α</italic> and 10.7 Å in yIre1 (yIre1 cLD: PDB ID 2BE1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>). (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A-C</xref> and Supplementary Fig. 9A). In our equilibrium simulations, the PDB model of the hIRE1<italic>α</italic> cLD dimer exhibited a less stable dimeric interface. Consequently, we compared the yeast dimer with the AF model of the human dimer, which features a groove width similar to that of the PDB model, measuring 7.4 Å. During simulations of the dimeric structures, the average groove width was 7.3 ± 0.1 Å for the human cLD and 8.9 ± 0.1 Å for the yeast cLD (average accounting for TIP3P and TIP4P-D replicas). In both humans and yeast, we noted a fluctuating groove width, which was somewhat wider in yeast. Nonetheless, we were unable to differentiate between the open and closed conformations in either structure. These data suggest, in contrast to what has been proposed before, that human IRE1<italic>α</italic> cLD in isolation does not adopt an open conformation. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup></p>

<p>Despite the structural similarities in the central regions of human and yeast cLD (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>), a closer examination reveals differences in the side chains of the <italic>α</italic>A-helices. In yeast, these are serines (S200), while in humans, they are glutamines (Q105) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>). The glutamines in human cLD possess a longer side chain than serines. The configurations they adopt during simulations enable them to occupy the space between the <italic>α</italic>A-helices (Supplementary Fig. 9B). These side chain arrangements result in spatial occupancy of the groove, particularly in instances of narrow groove width observed here.</p>
<p>In conclusion, our simulations revealed that in contrast to the yeast cLD that features a wider groove, the putative central groove of human IRE1<italic>α</italic> cLD is predominantly narrow and occluded by the steric obstruction from neighboring side chains. As our MD simulations did not show large conformational changes leading to the opening of the groove, our data suggest that it is unlikely that peptides bind into the central part of the MHC-like groove in the human IRE1<italic>α</italic> cLD.</p>

<title>Unfolded polypeptides can stably bind to hIRE1<italic>α</italic> cLD dimer</title>

Our goal was to elucidate a potential binding pose and identify the relevant features of unfolded proteins and the cLD that influence binding affinity. The simulated complexes were initialized by positioning the peptides in a fully stretched conformation above the central region of the dimer (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A-C</xref><bold>, at t = 0 µs</bold>). This enabled the peptides to equilibrate near the surface of hIRE1<italic>α</italic> within a few nanoseconds. In early simulations, we positioned the polypeptides over the cLD, aligning them parallel to the principal axis of the central groove in accordance with the proposed binding mode. We observed that the peptides could rearrange into an ori-entation perpendicular to the central groove axis (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref> and Supplementary Fig.10A, valine8 TIP4P-D). Conversely, peptides that were initially oriented perpendicularly did not transition to a parallel conformation. This finding suggests that the perpendicular binding mode is preferred.

<p>These peptides were primarily derived from Myelin Protein Zero (MPZ) and displayed a range of binding affinities (<italic>K</italic><sub><italic>1/2</italic></sub>; Supplementary Fig. 10C). The most potent binders, MPZ1-N, MPZ1N-2X, and 8ab1, remained bound to the dimer throughout all the 1 µs-long simulation replicas in TIP3P and TIP4P-D water. In contrast, we observed partial dissociation of MPZ1-C, which is a weaker binder. All PERK-targeted peptides, namely OR-1, V1rb2-1, and V1rb2-2, demonstrated strong binding to the cLD dimer. The apolar peptide valine8 dissociated in one-third of the simulations. By mutating all the arginines in MPZ1N-2X to aspartic acid, we obtained the MPZ1N-2X-RD. The MPZ1N-2X-RD has six negative charges instead of the six positive charges present on MPZ1N-2X. These mutations led to the dissociation of MPZ1N-2X-RD in half of the simulations, recovering the impaired binding observed in experiments. We also predicted the cLD dimer with MPZ1N-2X using AlphaFold3. The resulting conformations were similar to those obtained in our MD simulation (Supplementary Fig. 10D), thereby validating our model further. Notably, none of the peptides caused meaningful structural changes in the dimer, and we did not observe a groove opening induced by the peptides (Supplementary Fig. 10E). However, the unfolded peptides, particularly those rich in positively charged residues, remained bound to the hIRE1<italic>α</italic> cLD dimer surface and were preferentially oriented perpendicular to the groove’s main axis.

<title>Point mutation Y161R destabilizes unfolded peptide binding to cLD</title>
<p>The results from polypeptides-cLD simulations indicated that the cLD of hIRE1<italic>α</italic> formed selective interactions with the peptides. To investigate the characteristics of this association, we analyzed the contacts established during the simulations. The peptides interacted with various regions on the surface of the cLD dimer, particularly around the central groove (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref> and Supplementary Fig. 11A). Notably, the region above the <italic>α</italic>A-helices played a prominent role in these interactions, primarily due to the presence of a negatively charged residue E102, which might influence selectivity for positively charged peptides. However, the contact analysis primarily reflects the spatial proximity of residues and does not provide information regarding chemical specificity or established bonds. Consequently, these findings offer preliminary insights that necessitate further validation through individual trajectory examinations. Detailed observations of the simulation movies indicated that peptides with longer side chains, like arginine, penetrated more into the central region of the dimer. These residues engaged in particular with Y161, D181, and D79, thus forming what we refer to as a polar-charged pocket (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>, highlighted in yellow). In contrast, a hydrophobic-aromatic pocket defined by Y117, L103, and F98 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>, highlighted in red) showed affinity for residues like tryptophan, tyrosine, and leucine.

<p>In our analysis, we observe that Y161 interacts with arginines, which are key characteristic residues of peptides with a high affinity for cLD. Arginines and tyrosines can form hydrogen bonds.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup> Moreover, the mutation of corresponding residue F285 to alanine impairs the activity of yIre1.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup> Therefore, we considered Y161 an interesting binding hotspot and we performed a point mutation to arginine to disrupt as much as possible the biochemical characteristics of this binding site.</p>
<p>We investigated how the point mutation Y161R would affect peptide binding by simulating the cLD mutant in complex with MPZ1N-2X (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C-F</xref>).

In the case of the wild-type (WT) cLD dimer, the peptide generally maintained proximity to the center (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E</xref>). Conversely, MPZ1N-2X exhibited reduced stability in binding to the Y161R dimer’s surface, with one partial dissociation observed over six replicas, each lasting 1 µs (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4F</xref>). A comparative analysis of the contact sites of MPZ1N-2X on the cLD dimer in both WT and Y161R (Supplementary Fig. 11B-C) demonstrated that, in the presence of the mutation, the peptide interacts with a broader region of the dimer’s surface rather than remaining stably localized at the center.</p>

<p>We used AlphaFold 2 Multimer to investigate the interaction between cLD and a BiP cLD monomer (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>). The predicted interface included DR2, specifically residues 314-PLLEG-318, which formed a small parallel <italic>β</italic>-sheet interaction via two hydrogen bonds to the substrate-binding domain (SBD) of BiP. The interface predicted by AlphaFold showed stability across MD simulation replicas lasting 200 ns. Furthermore, we leveraged the re-lease of AlphaFold 3 to integrate the natural ligands of BiP: ATP and ADP. The predicted structures for the nucleotide-bound forms (Supplementary Fig. 12A-B) were similar to those obtained with AlphaFold 2. In contrast, the predicted apo complex (Supplementary Fig. 12C) stood apart, as it was the only configuration where the SBD exhibited a closed conformation, with the SBD lid (the helical domain segment of SBD) closing over DR2. Notably, the quality of the predicted complexes for both the apo state and the ATP-bound state were subpar (pTM=0.43, ipTM=0.46 and pTM=0.53, ipTM=0.48, respectively; ideally, pTM <italic>&gt;</italic> 0.5 and ipTM <italic>&gt;</italic> 0.6), while prediction quality improved significantly with ADP bound (pTM=0.67, ipTM=0.65).

<p>IRE1 is the most conserved activator of the UPR across all eukaryotes. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup> It responds to unfolded protein accumulation in the ER. Understanding the early activation stages of human IRE1<italic>α</italic> presents significant challenges due to conflicting evidence regarding the mechanism of IRE1’s interaction with unfolded peptides. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup> To clarify these early activation stages, we conducted extensive atomistic MD simulations of the human IRE1<italic>α</italic> cLD and its interaction partners.</p>
<p>Our simulations revealed that the human IRE1<italic>α</italic> cLD forms stable dimers in solution under conditions similar to <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments and non-stress situations. Our findings on dimer stability support the recent observation that IRE1 is present in cells as a constitutive homodimer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup> that forms oligomers in case of ER stress. We utilized two distinct models of the cLD dimer: one derived from X-ray crystallography <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup> (the “PDB model”) and the other predicted by AlphaFold 2 Multimer (the “AF model”).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup> The comparison between the two models was fundamental for identifying key structural elements. During the modeling of the missing disordered regions on the PDB model, we identified Y166 and L116 side chain orientation as crucial for the stability of the dimer. In fact, some mutants in this region that disturb the formation of dimers were previously identified by size exclusion chromatography,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup> including W125A, which is in contact with the residues we identified. Furthermore, we leveraged available data on HDX-MS experiments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup> to confirm that the dimeric interface is stable and observe that the <italic>α</italic>B-helices might be shorter than what is observed in the crystallographic structure. This is an interesting observation, given that the <italic>α</italic>B-helices are supposed to form the oligomerization interface of human IRE1<italic>α</italic> cLD.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup> Comparing simulation results to experimental data helped select the optimal dimer model and water force field, which is crucial for accurately reproducing the ensemble of disordered regions.</p>
<p>Credle et al. proposed that in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, the Ire1 cLD dimer interacts with unfolded proteins through a mechanism similar to the peptide-binding mode of MHC-I, where peptides occupy a central cleft. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup> Our simulations indicate that in comparison to the yeast IRE1 cLD dimer, the structure of the human dimer has a narrower central groove and is also gated by two glutamine side chains. This conformation prevents the formation of an ‘open’ peptide-binding central groove.</p>
<p>We tested several unfolded polypeptides for binding to the human IRE1<italic>α</italic> cLD dimer and found that peptides enriched in positive and aromatic residues can stably bind to the central part of the dimer, thanks to negative, polar, and aromatic amino acids. However, the binding does not take place inside the central groove. We found that the residues involved in peptide binding belong to the <italic>α</italic>A-helices, particularly E102, and to two pockets per monomer, characterized by residues Y117 and Y161. Among the most important contacts, we also identified L186, which was the main source of signal in the paramagnetic relaxation enhancement (PRE) experiments performed by spin-labeled peptides. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup> We find that peptides are able to bind to a ‘closed’ groove conformation, which is in line with fluorescence polarization experiments, showing that peptides can still bind to IRE1 LD Q105C SS where a disulfide bridge locks the dimer’s central groove.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup></p>
<p>We found that the Y161R mutation destabilizes the binding of MPZ1N-2X by reducing the interactions between the unfolded peptide and the central region of the hIRE1<italic>α</italic> cLD dimer. The residue Y161 is situated near L186, which is recognized as a critical hotspot for peptide binding based on PRE experiments with hIRE1<italic>α</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup> In addition, a mutation in the corresponding residue in yIre1 negatively affects protein activation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup> Our findings indicate that the Y161R mutation partially impairs peptide binding and may lead to a reduced binding affinity. However, it is important to note that since peptide binding relies on multiple low-affinity interactions, a single point mutation is unlikely to completely eliminate the binding ability.</p>
<p>We conducted further exploration of the intermolecular interactions involved in the early stages of hIRE1<italic>α</italic> activation. During this process, the protein interacts with unfolded proteins, other hIRE1<italic>α</italic> monomers and dimers, and BiP. Unfolded proteins may serve as linkers between cLD dimers under ER stress,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup> and Kettel et al. demonstrated that short peptides can facilitate clustering. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup> Based on the knowledge acquired here on key contact sites, we constructed a system where MPZ1N-2X peptide could maintain a stable interaction with two dimers at the same time. We speculate that unfolded proteins might bring dimers together in an early stage of ER stress and cluster formation, establishing assemblies with no defined stoichiometry or conformation. Structured oligomers, as observed in crystals by Credle et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup> and <italic>in situ</italic> by Tran et al.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup> might arise at later stages after allosteric rearrangement.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup> On the other hand, we showed that a complex formed by cLD and BiP, as predicted by AlphaFold, is stable in equilibrium simulations. These findings are in line with the work of Amin-Wetzel et al. and Dawes et al., <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup> who implied that DR2 should be involved in interactions with BiP. Kettel et al. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup> showed that mutating residues <sup>312</sup>TLPL<sup>315</sup>, which partially overlap with the predicted interaction interface, is detrimental to the formation of condensates and higher-order oligomers. These results hint at the role of BiP in disrupting the oligomers by shielding the DR2 and <italic>α</italic>B-helices, effectively blocking the oligomeric interface. Unfortunately, we noted that AlphaFold 3 clearly does not distinguish between states determined by the binding of different small ligands.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup></p>
<p>Recently, Simpson et al. identified a new binding site for cholera toxin on hIRE1<italic>α</italic> cLD,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup> which competes with C-terminal residues I362-P368. Here, however, we propose a different peptide binding mechanism that does not involve disordered regions, which could be a mode of action of a different set of peptides.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup> Indeed, the motif identified by Simpson et al. (YGWYXXH) is not recognizable in the model peptides studied here.</p>
<p>Our equilibrium atomistic molecular dynamics simulations are unbiased and provide a high level of detail. However, time scale limitations restrict our ability to observe the slower conformational rearrangements of the protein complexes analyzed here. We employed a force field designed for disordered and unfolded proteins,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup> but some bias could still exist. This could potentially lead to an overestimation of protein-protein interactions and hinder our observation of peptide dissociation in cases of intermediate binding affinities.</p>
<p>While here we focused on the activation of the UPR by an excessive accumulation of unfolded proteins, Ire1’s actiation is also triggered by a perturbation of the membrane composition of the ER.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></sup> Future work will focus on investigating a structural model that explains how Ire1 can integrate molecular stress signals both from the ER lumen and its membrane.</p>
<p>In summary, our research endorses a model for the activation of human IRE1<italic>α</italic>, where pre-existing dimers in the ER lumen directly engage with accumulating unfolded proteins via the cLD. These interactions could promote dimer aggregation and initiate the formation of larger supra-molecular assemblies. Furthermore, our structural data suggest that BiP may inhibit IRE1 from forming oligomers while allowing dimer presence. Therefore, the dissociation of hIRE1<italic>α</italic> dimers from BiP, followed by their direct engagement with unfolded proteins, might facilitate the nucleation of assemblies that act as precursors to organized oligomeric structures (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>). In conclusion, our results provide a comprehensive framework to understand the structural dynamics of the Ire1’s activation.</p>

    <p>Before the onset of ER stress conditions, hIRE1<italic>α</italic> is prevented from forming assemblies by the chaperone BiP, which occupies the cLD’s oligomeric interface.

These contact maps per frame were summed together and normalized by the number of frames to obtain the frequency of contacts for a given simulation replica. To obtain a ranking of the cLD amino acids in contact with unfolded peptides, the contact map was reduced to one dimension by summing all the contributions from all peptide residues and normalizing by the number of atoms in the peptide, resulting in an array matching the dimensions of the cLD dimer.

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This work provides structural and mechanistic insights into the disordered protein recognition process inside the endoplasmic reticulum by the inositol-requiring enzyme 1. Using state-of-the-art molecular dynamics simulation tools, the authors propose a mechanism of disordered protein recognition that reconciles contradictory findings of biochemical and structural biology experiments.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) All MD simulations have been carried out in triplicate, and several different folded conformations were generated using alphafold2. This provides adequate statistics to draw meaningful conclusions from the simulations.</p>
<p>(2) Potential limitations of the disordered protein force fields and water models have been taken into consideration. Particularly, performing the simulation in both TIP3P and TIP4PD water models ensures that the conclusions drawn are not influenced by the force field choice.</p>
<p>(3) The binding of a large number of disordered peptides was investigated, ensuring that the conclusions drawn about disordered peptide recognition are sufficiently general.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) The timescales of the peptide recognition and unbinding process are much longer than what can be sampled from unbiased simulations. Therefore, the proposed mechanism of recognition should only be considered a hypothesis based on the results presented here. For example, peptides that do not dissociate within one one-microsecond MD simulation are considered to be stable binders. However, they may not have a viable way to bind to the narrow protein cleft in the first place.</p>
<p>(2) Oftentimes, representative structures sampled from MD simulation are used to draw conclusions (e.g., Figure 4 about the role of R161 mutation in binding affinity). This is not appropriate as one unbinding event being observed or not observed in a microsecond-long trajectory does not provide sufficient information about the binding strength of the free energy difference.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this important work, the authors use extensive MD simulations to study how the IRE1 protein can detect unfolded peptides. Their study consolidates contradicting experimental results and offers a unique view of the different sensing models that have been proposed in the literature. Overall, it is an excellent study that is quite extensive. The research is solid, meticulous, and carefully performed, leading to convincing conclusions.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The strength of this work is the extensive and meticulous molecular dynamics simulations. The authors use and investigate different structural models, for example, carefully comparing a model based on a PDB structure with reconstructed loops with an AlphaFold 2 Multimer model. The author also investigates a wide range of different protein structural models that probe different aspects of the peptide sensing process. These solid and meticulous MD simulations allow the authors to obtain convincing conclusions concerning the peptide sensing process of the IRE1 protein.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>A potential weakness of the study is the usage of equilibrium (unbiased) molecular dynamics simulations, so that processes and conformational changes on the microsecond time scale can be probed. Furthermore, there can be inaccuracies and biases in the description of unfolded peptides and protein segments due to the protein force fields. Here, it should be noted that the authors do acknowledge these possible limitations of their study in the conclusions.</p>

<p>We thank the Reviewer for this valuable feedback. We agree with the Reviewer. Our work on the IRE1 cLD activation mechanism is focused on generating hypotheses of the binding mechanism driven by MD simulations. We recognize the limitations in defining a stable binder due to the time scales sampled. However, our primary focus was to sample and characterize a possible binding pose in the center of the cLD dimer. We will contextualize our statements about stable binders and limit our claims to stating that the protein-peptide complex is stable within 1 μs-long simulations. However, we believe that our finding that the cLD dimer groove is not able to accommodate peptides is solid, as the steric impediment described is present in all our replicas, both with and without peptides, in a cumulative sampling time of 72 μs. Additionally, we will include a plot showing the distribution of groove width across all replicas.</p>

<p>We thank the Reviewer for the insightful comment. As explained in the previous point, we believe that our simulations provide useful hypotheses, and we agree that we do not currently have data to comment on binding affinity. We will, therefore, remove all references to this term. We are aware of the limitations due to the timescale and agree that these limitations cannot be overcome with standard equilibrium simulations. To address these limitations, we plan to use orthogonal methods, namely MM/PB(GB)SA calculations for calculating binding free energies from existing trajectories (as performed by <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jcim.4c00975">https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jcim.4c00975</ext-link>). We will add predictions of all the peptides using AlphaFold 3, to confirm the binding region.</p>

<p>We thank the Reviewer for raising this critical point. We agree that the manuscript is tailored for a biology audience, as the data are particularly relevant for that community. Nevertheless, we also understand the importance of providing sufficient methodological detail for computational readers. We will add appropriate computational information in the main text.</p>

<p>We will add an uncertainty estimate for the HDX calculations using bootstrapping and include additional information on bond distances for Y161. We will also incorporate time-series data showing the distance of the peptide from the groove across all replicas.</p>

<p>We appreciate the Reviewer's thoughtful comment. As noted in our response to Reviewer 1, we plan to address the concern about sampling by applying orthogonal methods. We agree with the Reviewer that some form of enhanced sampling is necessary if we want to assess binding in a more quantitative way, e.g., via free energy calculations. However, we also realize that applying any enhanced sampling scheme to our system is very challenging, given its large size and the complex peptide-protein interactions, which are not easily captured in a few collective variables. After a careful assessment and some preliminary tests, we decided that estimating free energies using enhanced sampling would necessitate a separate paper due to both the conceptual complexity of the project and the size of the necessary sampling campaign.</p>
