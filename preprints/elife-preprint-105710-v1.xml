<title>Abstract</title><p>Sleep-wakefulness regulation dynamically evolves along development in flies, fish, and humans. While the mechanisms regulating sleep in adults are relatively well understood, little is known about their counterparts in early developmental stages. Here, we report a neuropeptidergic circuitry that modulates sleep in developing <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae. Through an unbiased screen, we identified the neuropeptide Hugin and its receptor PK2-R1 as critical regulators of larval sleep. Our data suggest that HugPC neurons secrete Hugin peptides to activate insulin-producing cells (IPCs), which express a Hugin receptor PK2-R1. IPCs, in turn, release <italic>Drosophila</italic> insulin-like peptides (Dilps) to regulate sleep. We further show that the Hugin/PK2-R1 axis is dispensable for adult sleep control. Our findings thus reveal the neuromodulatory circuitry regulating larval sleep, highlighting differential impacts of the same modulatory axis on developmental sleep and adult sleep.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Sleep is a fundamental state with significant impacts on many aspects of cognition and metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Blumberg et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Davis et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Sorribes et al., 2013</xref>). While sleep remains essential throughout life, its regulation unfolds dynamically over the course of development. For instance, the pace of sleep-wakefulness cycle is relatively fast in infants, but then gradually slows down and stabilizes in adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Blumberg et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Davis et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Sorribes et al., 2013</xref>). Furthermore, sleep-wake cycle in infants is independent of circadian rhythm, but it gradually comes under the circadian regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Davis et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Frank et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Poe et al., 2023</xref>). Such developmental evolution of sleep-wakefulness cycles appears to be conserved across flies and mammals, including humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Blumberg et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Davis et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Poe et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Szuperak et al., 2018</xref>). In contrast to the deep insight into the molecular and neural mechanisms underlying adult sleep regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Barlow &amp; Rihel, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Scammell et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Shafer &amp; Keene, 2021</xref>), little is known about regulatory mechanisms underlying infant sleep, partially due to a lack of convenient models to study developmental sleep.</p>
<p><italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae have recently emerged as a suitable model for studying sleep regulation mechanisms. Recent studies have reported that the second instar larvae show short periods (&lt; 6 seconds) of an “inactive state” during locomotion. Importantly, this “inactive state” is consistent with the general definition of sleep: reduced responsiveness to noxious stimuli, homeostatic responses to sleep deprivation, and rapid reversibility upon stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Szuperak et al., 2018</xref>), suggesting that the “inactive state” might correspond to the sleep state. Interestingly, loss-of-function mutations in the clock genes <italic>clock</italic> and <italic>cyc</italic> fail to impact larval sleep, while significantly altering the sleep patterns in adult flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Dubowy &amp; Sehgal, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Hendricks et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Szuperak et al., 2018</xref>). Likewise, mutations in the dopamine transporter <italic>DAT</italic> do not influence larval sleep, while reducing sleep amounts in adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Kume et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Szuperak et al., 2018</xref>). These observations imply that sleep regulation mechanisms may be, at least in part, distinct between larvae and adults, yet the neural mechanism of larval sleep remains vastly understudied compared to that of adult sleep.</p>
<p>In this study, we performed an unbiased genetic screen in second-instar larvae, and identified the neuropeptide Hugin and its receptor PK2-R1 as a pair critical for larval sleep control. At the circuit level, Hugin-producing HugPC neurons directly stimulate the insulin-producing cells (IPCs) via PK2-R1 to regulate sleep. Surprisingly, we found that regulators of larval sleep are either irrelevant or exert the opposite effects on adult sleep. Overall, our findings uncover the neuropeptidergic circuitry that regulates larval sleep, and highlight the mechanistic differences between larval and adult sleep.</p>

<title>PK2-R1 is required for sleep control in <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae</title>
<p>To understand the molecular and neural mechanisms of larval sleep, we modified a previously reported system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Churgin et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Szuperak et al., 2018</xref>) to automatically quantify the sleep amount of second instar larvae (<xref rid="fig1S1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) (see Materials &amp; Methods for details). Our system automatically annotates larvae in each frame as either “inactive” or “active” states on the basis of pixel changes, with ∼90% accuracy compared to manual annotation (<xref rid="fig1S1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). We found that bouts of ≥ 12 inactive frames are consistent with the general criteria for sleep: reduced responsiveness to noxious stimuli, homeostatic responses to sleep loss, and rapid reversibility upon stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Raizen et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Szuperak et al., 2018</xref>) (<xref rid="fig1S2" ref-type="fig">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>. Therefore, the present study defines sleep as an inactive state of ≥ 12 consecutive frames (<xref rid="fig1S1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>).</p>
<p>Using this system, we next carried out an unbiased screen for genes involved in sleep regulation. To this end, we tested 47 CRISPR knock-out lines of genes encoding enzymes or receptors for neuropeptides and monoamines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Deng et al., 2019</xref>). As illustrated in <xref rid="fig1S3" ref-type="fig">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>, 13 out of 47 homozygous null mutants exhibited significant changes in sleep amounts compared to the control group. To further test the functions of these candidate genes, we next took advantage of the CRISPR knock-in drivers in which GAL4 sequence is inserted into each gene locus. With these drivers, we silenced neurons expressing each candidate gene by expressing the inward-rectifying potassium channel Kir2.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Baines et al., 2001</xref>). Silencing neurons expressing <italic>Oamb</italic> and <italic>PK2-R1</italic> resulted in a significant sleep decrease, phenocopying the knock-out of these genes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1B</xref>, and <xref rid="fig1S4" ref-type="fig">Figure 1—figure supplement 4D</xref>). <italic>Oamb</italic> encodes the octopamine receptor and has been reported to be involved in larval sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Szuperak et al., 2018</xref>). The role of <italic>PK2-R1</italic> in larval sleep, on the other hand, has been unknown to date, prompting us to focus on this gene.</p>

<title>Insulin-producing cells express PK2-R1 and regulate sleep in developing larvae</title>
<p>Since the <italic>PK2-R1</italic> driver broadly labeled neurons (∼1000 cells) throughout the CNS (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>), we next attempted to identify a subpopulation of these neurons relevant for sleep regulation.

Consistently, both <italic>Dilp3</italic> and <italic>Dilp5</italic> null mutants exhibited larger sleep amounts compared to the control (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>). These phenotypes of <italic>Dilp</italic> mutants IPC silencing are unlikely to be attributed to locomotion defects, as the travel distances during wake periods were unaffected (<xref rid="fig2S1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref> and <xref rid="fig2S1" ref-type="fig">1C</xref>). Collectively, these findings suggest that <italic>PK2-R1</italic> in IPCs regulates larval sleep.</p>

<title>Hugin-expressing neurons control larval sleep</title>
<p>Given that PK2-R1 is a receptor for the neuropeptide Hugin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Rosenkilde et al., 2003</xref>), we next examined whether Hugin is involved in larval sleep. We found that <italic>Hug</italic> mutant larvae exhibited significantly larger sleep amounts compared to the control (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>), consistent with the <italic>PK2-R1</italic> knock-out (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>).

Conversely, activation of <italic>Hug</italic>-expressing neurons with the red-shifted channel rhodopsin ReaChR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Inagaki et al., 2014</xref>) or the heat-sensitive ion channel TrpA1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Hamada et al., 2008</xref>) both caused a significant reduction in sleep amount (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3D</xref>). These data together indicate that <italic>Hug</italic>-expressing neurons are responsible for downregulating larval sleep.</p>

<p><italic>Hug</italic>-expressing neurons are comprised of 20 cells in the subesophageal zone (SEZ) of the brain, and are classified into four subpopulations based on their projection patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Bader et al., 2007</xref>). Of these, one subpopulation called HugPC neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Bader et al., 2007</xref>) has been reported to form synaptic connections with IPCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Hückesfeld et al., 2016</xref>). We thus suspected that HugPC neurons may be responsible for sleep regulation. In line with this notion, axons of HugPC neurons labeled by a newly generated <italic>HugPC-LexA</italic> driver (<xref rid="fig3S2" ref-type="fig">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>) and IPCs labeled by <italic>Dilp3-GAL4</italic> are located in close proximity to each other (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>). Indeed, silencing of HugPC neurons by Kir2.1 significantly increased larval sleep (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref>), phenocopying those observed in <italic>Hug</italic> and <italic>PK2-R1</italic> mutants. These results hint at the possibility that HugPC neurons activate IPCs via Hugin/PK2-R1 signaling to regulate sleep.</p>

<title>Hugin triggers Ca<sup>2+</sup> elevation and Dilp secretion in larval IPCs via PK2-R1</title>
<p>A previous report showed that IPCs exhibit increased firing rates and intracellular calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) levels upon stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Kréneisz et al., 2010</xref>). This motivated us to test whether Hugin activates IPCs. To this end, we utilized the recently developed calcium indicator CRTC::GFP, which can report Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics in the timescale of several minutes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bonheur et al., 2023</xref>). As glucose reportedly triggers Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics in IPCs in a range of minutes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Oh et al., 2019</xref>), we wondered if CRTC::GFP can detect these dynamics as a positive control. To this end, we applied D-glucose to isolated larval brains and found a significant cytosol-to-nuclear translocation of CRTC::GFP in IPCs within ∼5 min, confirming that this reporter can indeed detect Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses in IPCs upon stimulation (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5B</xref>). We then examined whether <italic>Hug</italic> neurons act upstream of <italic>PK2-R1</italic>-expressing IPCs, by measuring Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses of IPCs while thermogenetically activating <italic>Hug</italic> neurons with TrpA1 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). In both isolated brains (<italic>ex vivo</italic>) and living larvae (<italic>in vivo</italic>), we found that activation of <italic>Hug</italic> neurons significantly increased Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels in IPCs (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4C</xref>), suggesting that <italic>Hug</italic> neurons act upstream of IPCs (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>). Next, we tested whether Hug peptides can induce Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses in IPCs using <italic>ex vivo</italic> preparations. The <italic>Hug</italic> gene encodes a precursor that potentially produces at least two distinct peptides, Hug-γ and PK-2, both of which can bind PK2-R1 to induce Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Rosenkilde et al., 2003</xref>). We thus incubated the CRTC::GFP-expressing larval brain with chemically synthesized Hug-γ or PK-2 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). We found that bath application of either Hug-γ or PK-2 induced significant Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses in IPCs (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B–D</xref>).

<p>Interestingly, the expression patterns of <italic>PK2-R1</italic> and <italic>Hug</italic>, as well as the morphology of HugPC neurons and IPCs, were almost comparable between larvae and adults (<xref rid="fig6S2" ref-type="fig">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). This implies that the differential roles of Hug in larvae versus adults are likely due to physiological differences in HugPC neurons and/or IPCs. We thus examined how Hug peptides evoke Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses in adult IPCs and found that neither Hug-γ nor PK-2 could induce Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses in adult IPCs (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6E</xref>), unlike in larvae. Consistently, Hug peptides failed to reduce Dilp3 levels in adult IPCs (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6F</xref>). These data indicate that Hug induces Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses and Dilp secretion in larval IPCs, but not in adult IPCs. Surprisingly, we further found that <italic>Dilp3</italic> or <italic>Dilp5</italic> null mutations reduced sleep amounts in adults (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>), while in larvae, these mutations in fact increased the sleep amounts.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we have identified the neuropeptide Hugin and its receptor PK2-R1 as a ligand/receptor pair critical for sleep regulation in <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae. We have further shown that larval IPCs express PK2-R1, respond to and release Dilp3 upon Hugin stimulation. Surprisingly, the Hugin/PK2-R1 axis is dispensable for sleep regulation in adults, even though gene expressions as well as the circuit structure appeared to be conserved between larval and adult brains. Furthermore, Dilps appear to modulate sleep in opposite directions in larvae and adults. Our findings thus uncover the neuropeptidergic modulation circuitry that specifically regulates developmental sleep, and suggest divergent usage of the same molecules and circuitry for sleep modulation in larvae and adults.</p>
<sec id="s3a">
<title>Hugin/PK2-R1/Dilps axis negatively regulates sleep in larvae</title>
<p>The present study shows that the neuropeptide Hugin and its receptor PK2-R1 are required for sleep regulation in the early larval stage. This notion is supported by the following lines of evidence. First, knock-out mutations in <italic>Hug</italic> or <italic>PK2-R1</italic> increased sleep amounts compared to the control (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3A</xref>). Consistently, silencing a subpopulation of <italic>Hug</italic>-expressing neurons, called HugPC neurons, or <italic>PK2-R1</italic> neurons increased sleep amounts (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3F</xref>). Second, thermogenetic activation of <italic>Hug</italic> neurons decreased sleep amounts (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>). Third, HugPC neurons project their axons to IPCs in the brain that express PK2-R1 receptors (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>). Fourth, Hug peptides induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> elevation and promoted Dilp3 release from IPCs in a PK2-R1- dependent manner (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>). Last, <italic>Dilp3</italic> null mutations increased sleep amounts (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>). Based on these data, we propose a model in which the Hugin/PK2- R1/Dilps axis along the HugPC-IPC circuitry modulates larval sleep (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>).</p>

<p>Examples of Hugin acting through PK2-R1 are prominent in the context of feeding regulation in larvae and adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Schoofs et al., 2014</xref>). For example, a recent study has suggested that Hugin regulates the timing of pupariation and body wall contraction during pupariation through PK2-R1 in PTTH neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Ohhara et al., 2024</xref>). In the present study, we showed that HugPC in the larval brain modulates sleep (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref>). A previous electron microscopic analysis suggested that larval HugPC neurons likely form synaptic connections to downstream neurons, including IPCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Hückesfeld et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Schlegel et al., 2016</xref>). We here showed that larval sleep control requires PK2-R1, and that thermogenetic activation of <italic>Hug</italic> neurons causes Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses in PK2-R1- expressing IPCs (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>). Importantly, our <italic>ex vivo</italic> data indicated that Hugin peptide- induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> response in IPCs was largely abolished by <italic>PK2-R1</italic> mutation (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>), indicating the critical role of the Hugin/PK2-R1 axis for the HugPC-mediated IPC activation. Together, we propose that the HugPC-IPCs circuity mobilizes Hugin/PK2-R1 signaling to selectively modulate larval sleep. Interestingly, our <italic>ex vivo</italic> data indicated that Neuromedin U (NMU), a mammalian ortholog of Hugin, can trigger Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses in larval IPCs in a PK2-R1-dependent fashion (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>). Given that NMU has been implicated in sleep regulation in fish and mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Ahnaou &amp; Drinkenburg, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Chiu et al., 2016</xref>), an analogous ligand/receptor pair might be involved in sleep modulation in mammals as well.</p>

<title>Divergent roles of insulin in regulation of larval sleep and feeding</title>
<p>IPCs in larvae responded to exogenously applied Hug peptides, both by exhibiting elevated Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels and decreases in intracellular Dilp3 storage (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C–E</xref>). In contrast to Dilp3, however, the amount of Dilp2 accumulated in IPCs did not decrease following Hug peptide application (<xref rid="fig5S1" ref-type="fig">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>). On the other hand, Dilp2 accumulation in IPCs decreased after glucose treatment (<xref rid="fig5S1" ref-type="fig">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Oh et al., 2019</xref>). These results unexpectedly suggest that larval IPCs form parallel channels inside, one for Hug-Dilp3 and the other for glucose-Dilp2.</p>
<p>Mechanistically, Hug acts directly on IPCs via the PK2-R1 receptor. As for glucose, on the other hand, glucose-sensing CN neurons in the brain take up glucose and subsequently secrete another neuropeptide to activate IPCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Oh et al., 2019</xref>). Such parallelism inside IPCs might provide insights into why insect species broadly express multiple insulin-like peptide genes, in some cases even as many as 40 genes in the silkworm <italic>Bombyx mori</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Okamoto, 2021</xref>). <italic>Drosophila</italic> genome harbors eight <italic>Dilp</italic> genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Nässel et al., 2015</xref>), of which <italic>Dilp2</italic>, <italic>Dilp3</italic>, and <italic>Dilp5</italic> are considered nutrient-related.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, mRNA expression or release patterns of these Dilps are not identical under different nutrient conditions (Géminard et al., 2024; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Nässel et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Oh et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Ikeya et al., 2002</xref>). Furthermore, these Dilps exhibit different binding affinities for the insulin receptor (InR), the secreted decoy of InR (SDR), and the ecdysone-inducible gene L2 (Imp-L2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Okamoto et al., 2013</xref>). These reports hint at the differential roles of different insulin-like peptides; however, mechanistic insights remain largely lacking. Our data on larval IPCs forming parallel channels for Hug-Dilp3 and glucose-Dilp2 may provide a point of entry for tackling this mystery.</p>

<title>Differential impacts of the same neuropeptidergic modulations on larval and adult sleep</title>
<p>Our data show that the Hugin/PK2-R1/Dilps axis likely downregulates sleep amounts in larvae. Despite the significant increase in sleep amount in <italic>Hug</italic> mutant larvae, <italic>Hug</italic> mutant adults showed sleep amounts comparable to wild-type control (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>), consistent with a previous report that Hugin is dispensable for control of baseline sleep levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Schwarz et al., 2021</xref>). According to our histological analyses, the Hugin/PK2-R1 expression patterns, as well as the HugPC-IPCs circuitry, appear to be largely conserved in adults (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref> and <xref rid="fig6S2" ref-type="fig">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). Unlike larval brains, however, Hug peptides failed to trigger Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses in adults IPCs (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6E</xref>). It is thus possible that Hugin/PK2-R1 signaling along the HugPC-IPCs circuitry is suppressed in adults. IPCs in adults receive multiple positive and negative modulatory inputs through GPCRs including the metabotropic GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Enell et al., 2010</xref>), which suppress IPC activity and Dilp release in adult IPCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Enell et al., 2010</xref>). It is thus plausible that such negative modulatory inputs to IPCs in adults might counteract the Hugin/PK2-R1 axis to suppress Dilp release. In addition, our data suggest that Dilps modulate sleep amount in the opposite directions in larvae and adults (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>).</p>
<p>Comparing the expression levels and activities of GPCRs in larval and adult IPCs would be essential to better understand how same modulatory signals over the course of development come to exert differential impacts on sleep. Interestingly, Hugin in adults appears irrelevant for the baseline sleep amount but is required for homeostatic regulation of sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Schwarz et al., 2021</xref>). Thus, testing whether the Hugin/PK2-R1 axis is involved in the homeostatic regulation of larval sleep, and how this system compares to its adult counterpart, may further provide mechanistic insights into how homeostatic sleep regulation maturates over development.</p>
<p>In summary, we identified the Hugin/PK2-R1/Dilps signaling along the HugPC/IPCs circuit as the molecular and circuitry basis for larval sleep regulation. Our study begins to fill the knowledge gap in larval sleep regulation, and sheds light on mechanistic differences in sleep regulation between early developmental stages and adults.</p>

For each well and frame, the image of larva was blurred and binarized to automatically locate the larva. Consecutive frames were then compared so that changes in values were summed to estimate the larval motion.

<p><italic>HugPC-LexA</italic> lines were generated by ΦC31 integrase-mediated transgenesis, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Groth et al., 2004</xref>). The 544-bp enhancer region of <italic>Hug,</italic> identical region to that used for <italic>HugPC-GAL4</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Hückesfeld et al., 2016</xref>), was PCR-amplified from fly genomic DNA. The gel-purified amplicon was subjected to another round of PCR to add hangout sequences. The backbone suicide-vector pBPnlsLexA::p65Uw (RRID:Addgene_26230) was initially amplified by transforming the <italic>ccdB</italic>-resistant <italic>E. coli</italic> strain, One Shot™ <italic>ccdB</italic> Survival™ 2 T1<sup>R</sup> competent cells (Thermo Fisher Scientific, cat# A10460). The PCR product and the vector were digested by Aat II (NEB, cat# R0117S) and Fse I (NEB, cat# R0588S), followed by ligation using In-Fusion HD Cloning Kit w/Cloning Enhancer (Takara Bio, cat# 639635). The integrity of the resulting plasmid was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Plasmid insertion was targeted to four attP sites (attP2, attP40, VK00005, and su(Hw)attP5) individually through ΦC31 integrase-mediated transgenesis by BestGene Inc. (Chino Hills, CA).</p>
<p>Transformants were selected based on the eye color marker. Among the generated strains harboring <italic>HugPC-LexA</italic> in each insertion site, labeling patterns in the larval brain were checked by driving fluorescent marker expression under the control of <italic>LexAop</italic> sequence (<xref rid="fig3S2" ref-type="fig">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). As the <italic>HugPC-LexA</italic> inserted in attP2 closely resembled the labeling pattern of the original <italic>HugPC-GAL4</italic>, we chose this driver in further experiments.</p>
<p>The following primers were used for cloning:</p>
<p>Forward primer for the <italic>HugPC</italic> enhancer; 1<sup>st</sup> round PCR against genomic DNA:</p>
<p>5’-AAGGGTTTGGTTTAATTTATTTATGTCATA-3’</p>

<title>Measurement of neuronal activity and Dilp3 accumulation in IPCs</title>
<p>The GFP-tagged CRTC (CRTC::GFP) reporter was applied to quantify the activities of larval IPCs, essentially according to the previous report in adult flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bonheur et al., 2023</xref>). Parental <italic>Dilp3-GAL4</italic> and the reporter line harboring <italic>UAS-CRTC::GFP</italic> and <italic>UAS-mCD8::mCherry</italic> (BDSC# 99657) were crossed, and eggs were collected within an 8–10 h time window. Offspring larvae were reared for 4 days after egg laying (AEL) at 25°C until the early third instar. Collected larvae were washed with water and starved on water-soaked paper for 12–14 h. For <italic>in vivo</italic> thermogenetic activation, larva-containing Petri dishes were warmed at 30°C for 60 min. For <italic>ex vivo</italic> thermogenetic experiments, larvae were dissected in calcium- and sugar-free HL3.1 buffer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Nakamizo-Dojo et al., 2023</xref>) and each brain was incubated in the same buffer at 30°C for 5 min.</p>
<p>For <italic>ex vivo</italic> glucose or peptide application assays, larvae were first dissected in the same buffer as above at room temperature, and brain samples were then treated with either 20 mM D-glucose or 1 mM of chemically synthesized peptides dissolved in HL3.1 buffer for 5 min. After incubation, samples were subjected to immunohistochemical analyses to visualize GFP, mCherry, and anti-Dilp3 signals (see the section “Immunohistochemistry”).</p>
<p>Image processing was performed using ImageJ v1.53t ((<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Schneider et al., 2012</xref>); RRID:SCR_003070). Nuclear ROIs and cell body outlines were determined based on the mCD8::mCherry fluorescence insensitive to neuronal activity, and the mean intensities of CRTC::GFP signals within the nucleus (F<sub>nuc</sub>) and the cytoplasm (F<sub>cyto</sub> = F<sub>whole cell</sub> - F<sub>nuc</sub>) were quantified. NLI was calculated using the following formula: (F<sub>nuc</sub> - F<sub>cyto</sub>)/(F<sub>nuc</sub> + F<sub>cyto</sub>). To assess Dilp3 accumulation in IPCs, the anti-Dilp3 signal intensity was measured within the cytosol of each cell, excluding the nucleus. Data from 4–14 Dilp3-positive IPCs per brain, collected from 3–7 larvae, were pooled for each genotype/treatment group.</p>

<title>Sleep quantification in adult flies</title>
<p>The following parts of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> activity monitor (DAM) system were purchased from TriKinetics Inc. (Waltham, MA): the <italic>Drosophila</italic> Activity Monitor (cat# DAM2), the power supply interface unit (cat# PSIU9), monitor tubes with an outside diameter of 5 mm and a length of 65 mm (cat# PGT5x65), and tube caps (cat# CAP5-Black). Newly eclosed adult flies were collected under brief CO<sub>2</sub> anesthesia and kept as groups of 10– 15 in standard food vials. Males and females were kept separately to avoid mating. To minimize disturbance by noise and vibration, flies were placed inside a fan-less Peltier-type incubator (Mitsubishi Electric Engineering Co., Ltd., cat# SLC-25) set to 25°C, externally connected with 5-mm diameter LED lights (MY-CRAFT, Ltd., cat# 5W0601) and a timer device (Panasonic Corp., cat# WH3311WP) to generate a 9AM:9PM light/dark cycle. After 3 days of eclosion, each fly was gently aspirated into a Pyrex glass monitor tube, one end of which was stuffed with agar food (2% (w/w) agar and 5% (w/w) sucrose), and the other was plugged with a cotton string. The tubes were set to the monitor device and placed inside the same fan-less incubator. The DAM system was connected to an external PC running DAMSystem3 Data Collection Software (RRID:SCR_021809; available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://trikinetics.com/">https://trikinetics.com/</ext-link>), which counted beam-crossings by each fly for two successive days. Time windows longer than 5 min without beam-crossing were judged as sleep bouts, following the conventional criteria for adult fly sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Paul et al., 2000</xref>).</p>

<caption><title>Detailed experimental setup for analyzing larval sleep</title>
<p>(A) Schematic flow of automated larval sleep quantification. A second instar larva was placed in each of 24 wells, and all 24 wells were videotaped from above. For each well and frame, the image of larva was blurred and binarized to automatically locate the larva. Consecutive frames were then compared so that changes in pixel values were summed to estimate larval motion. This motion estimate was then used to classify every consecutive pair of frames as representing “active” or “inactive.” We found that inactivity across 12 consecutive frames meets the sleep criteria, as shown in <xref rid="fig1S2" ref-type="fig">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>. (B) Schematic representation of the 24-well chamber used for larval sleep assays. (C) Flow of automated processes of larval motion detection and active/inactive state determination.

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The study investigates how neuropeptidergic signaling affects sleep regulation in Drosophila larvae. The authors first conduct a screen of CRISPR knock-out lines of genes encoding enzymes or receptors for neuropeptides and monoamines. As a result of this screen, the authors follow up on one hit, the hugin receptor, PK2-R1. They use genetic approaches, including mutants and targeted manipulations of PK2-R1 activity in insulin-producing cells (IPCs) to increase total sleep amounts in 2nd instar larvae. Similarly, dilp3 and dilp5 null mutants and genetic silencing of IPCs show increases in sleep. The authors also show that hugin mutants and thermogenetic/optogenetic activation of hugin-expressing neurons caused reductions in sleep. Furthermore, they show through imaging-based approaches that hugin-expressing neurons activate IPCs. A key finding is that wash-on of hugin peptides, Hug-γ and PK-2, in ex vivo brain preparations activates larval IPCs, as assayed by CRTC::GFP imaging. The authors then examine how the PK2-R1, hugin, and IPC manipulations affect adult sleep. Finally, the authors examine how Ca2+ responses through CRTC::GFP imaging in adult IPCs are influenced by the wash-on of hugin peptides. The conclusions of this paper are somewhat well supported by data, but some aspects of the experimental approach and sleep analysis need to be clarified and extended.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) This paper builds on previously published studies that examine Drosophila larval sleep regulation. Through the power of Drosophila genetics, this study yields additional insights into what role neuropeptides play in the regulation of Drosophila larval sleep.</p>
<p>(2) This study utilizes several diverse approaches to examine larval and adult sleep regulation, neural activity, and circuit connections. The impressive array of distinct analyses provides new understanding into how Drosophila sleep-wake circuitry in regulated across the lifespan.</p>
<p>(3) The imaging approaches used to examine IPC activation upon hugin manipulation (either thermogenetic activation or wash-on of peptides) demonstrate a powerful approach for examining how changes in neuropeptidergic signaling affect downstream neurons. These experiments involve precise manipulations as the authors use both in vivo and ex vivo conditions to observe an effect on IPC activity.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Although the paper does have some strengths in principle, these strengths are not fully supported by the experimental approaches used by the authors. In particular:</p>
<p>(1) The authors show total sleep amount over an 18-hour period for all the measures of 2nd instar larval sleep throughout the paper. However, published studies have shown that sleep changes over the course of 2nd instar development, so more precise time windows are necessary for the analyses in this study.</p>
<p>(2) Previously published reports of sleep metrics in both Drosophila larvae and adults include the average number of sleep episodes (bout number) and the average length of sleep episodes (bout length). Neither of these metrics is included in the paper for either the larval sleep or adult sleep data. Not including these metrics makes it difficult for readers to compare the findings in this study to previously published papers in the established Drosophila sleep literature.</p>
<p>(3) Because Drosophila adult &amp; larval sleep is based on locomotion, the authors need to show the activity values for the experiments supporting their key conclusions. They do show travel distances in Figure 2 - Figure Supplement 1, however, it is not clear how these distances were calculated or how the distances relate to the overall activity of individual larvae during sleep experiments. It is also concerning that inactivation of the PK2-R1-expressing neurons causes a reduction in locomotion speed. This could partially explain the increase in sleep that they observe.</p>
<p>(4) The authors rely on homozygous mutant larvae and adult flies to support many of their conclusions. They also rely on Gal4 lines with fairly broad expression in the Drosophila brain to support their conclusions. Adding more precise tissue-specific manipulations, including thermogenetic activation and inhibition of smaller populations of neurons in the study would be needed to increase confidence in the presented results. Similarly, demonstrating that larval development and feeding are not affected by the broad manipulations would strengthen the conclusions.</p>
<p>(5) Many of the experiments presented in this study would benefit from genetic and temperature controls. These controls would increase confidence in the presented results.</p>
<p>(6) The authors claim that their findings in larvae uncover the circuit basis for larval sleep regulation. However, there is very little comparison to published studies demonstrating that neuropeptides like Dh44 regulate larval sleep. Because hugin-expressing neurons have been shown to be downstream of Dh44 neurons, the authors need to include this as part of their discussion. The authors also do not explain why other neuropeptides in the initial screen are not pursued in the study. Given the effect that these manipulations have on larval sleep in their initial screen, it seems likely that other neuropeptidergic circuits regulate larval sleep.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This study examines larval sleep patterns and compares them to sleep regulation in adult flies. The authors demonstrate hallmark sleep characteristics in larvae, including sleep rebound and increased arousal thresholds. Through genetic and behavioral analyses, they identify PK2-R1 as a key receptor involved in sleep modulation, likely via the HuginPC-IPC signaling pathway. Loss of PK2-R1 results in increased sleep, which aligns with previous findings in hugin knockout mutants. While the study presents significant contributions to the field, further investigation is needed to address discrepancies with earlier research and strengthen mechanistic claims.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) The study explores a relatively understudied aspect of sleep regulation, focusing on larval development.</p>
<p>(2) The use of an automated behavioral measurement system ensures precise quantification of sleep patterns.</p>
<p>(3) The findings provide strong genetic and behavioral evidence supporting the role of the HuginPC-IPC pathway in sleep regulation.</p>
<p>(4) The study has broader implications for understanding the evolution and functional divergence of sleep circuits.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) The manuscript does not sufficiently discuss previous studies, particularly concerning hugin mutants and their metabolic effects.</p>
<p>(2) The specificity of IPC secretion mechanisms is unclear, particularly regarding potential indirect effects on Dilp2.</p>
<p>(3) Alternative circuits, such as the HuginPC-DH44 pathway, require further consideration.</p>
<p>(4) Functional connectivity between HuginPC neurons and IPCs is not directly validated.</p>
<p>(5) Developmental differences in sleep regulatory mechanisms are not thoroughly examined.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Sleep affects cognition and metabolism, evolving throughout development. In mammals, infants have fast sleep-wake cycles that stabilize in adults via circadian regulation. In this study, the author performed a genetic screen for neurotransmitters/peptides regulating sleep and identified the neuropeptide Hugin and its receptor PK2-R1 as essential components for sleep in Drosophila larvae. They showed that IPCs express Pk2-R1 and silencing IPCs resulted in a significant increase in the sleep amount, which was consistent with the effect they observed in PK2-R1 knock-out mutants. They also showed that Hugin peptides, secreted by a subset of Hugin neurons (Hug-PC), activate IPCs through the PK2-R1 receptor. This activation prompts IPCs to release insulin-like peptides (Dilps), which are implicated in the modulation of sleep. They showed that Hugin peptides induce a PK2-R1 dependent calcium (Ca²⁺) increase in IPCs, which they linked to the release of Dilp3, showing a connection between Hugin signaling to IPCs, Dilp3 release, and sleep regulation. Additionally, the activation of Hug-PC neurons reduced sleep amounts, while silencing them had the opposite effect. In contrast to the larval stage, the Hugin/PK2-R1 axis was not critical for sleep regulation in Drosophila adults, suggesting that this neuropeptidergic circuitry has divergent roles in sleep regulation across different stages of development.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This study used an updated system for sleep quantification in Drosophila larvae, and this method allowed precise measurement of larval sleep patterns which is essential for the understanding of sleep regulation.</p>
<p>The authors performed unbiased genetics screening and successfully identified novel regulators for larval sleep, Hugin and its receptor PK2-R1, making a substantial contribution to the understanding of neuropeptidergic control of sleep regulation.</p>
<p>They clearly demonstrated the mechanism by which Hugin-expressing neurons influence sleep through the activation of IPCs via PK2-R1 with Ca2+ responses and can modulate sleep.</p>
<p>Based on the demonstrated activation of PK2-R1 by the human Hugin orthologue Neuromedin U, research on human sleep disorders may benefit from the discoveries from Drosophila since sleep-regulating mechanisms are conserved across species.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The study primarily focused on sleep regulation in Drosophila larvae, showing that the Hugin/PK2-R1 axis is critical for larval sleep but not necessary for adult sleep. The effects of the Hugin axis in the adult are, however, incompletely explained and somewhat inconsistent. PK2-R1 knockout adults also display increased sleep, as does HugPC silencing, at least for daytime sleep. The difference lies in Dilp3/5 mutant animals showing decreased sleep and IPCs seemingly responding with reduced Dilp3 release to PK-2 treatment (Figure 6). It seems difficult to reconcile the author's conclusions regarding this point without additional data. It could be argued that PK2-R1 still regulates adult sleep, but not via Hugin and IPCs/Dilps.</p>
<p>Another issue might be that the authors show relative sleep levels for adults using Trikinetics monitoring. From the methods, it is not clear if the authors backcrossed their line to an isogenic wild-type background to normalize for line-specific effects on sleep. Thus, it is likely that each line has differences in total sleep time due to background effects, e.g., their Kir2.1 control line showed reduced sleep relative to the compared genotypes. This might limit the conclusions on the role of Hugin/PK2-R1 on adult sleep.</p>
