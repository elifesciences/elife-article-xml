<title>Abstract</title><p>Most malaria rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) detect <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> histidine-rich protein 2 (PfHRP2) and PfHRP3, but deletions of <italic>pfhrp2</italic> and <italic>phfrp3</italic> genes make parasites undetectable by RDTs. To better understand these deletions, we analyzed 19,289 public whole-genome-sequenced <italic>P. falciparum</italic> field samples. <italic>Pfhrp2</italic> deletion only occurred by chromosomal breakage with subsequent telomere healing. <italic>Pfhrp3</italic> deletions involved loss from <italic>pfhrp3</italic> to the telomere and showed 3 patterns: no other associated rearrangement with evidence of telomere healing at breakpoint (Asia; Pattern 13<sup>-</sup>); associated with duplication of a chromosome 5 segment containing multidrug-resistant-1 gene (Asia; Pattern 13<sup>-</sup>5<sup>++</sup>); and most commonly, associated with duplication of a chromosome 11 segment (Americas/Africa; Pattern 13<sup>-</sup>11<sup>++</sup>). We confirmed a 13-11 hybrid chromosome with long-read sequencing, consistent with a translocation product arising from recombination between large interchromosomal ribosome-containing segmental duplications. Within most 13<sup>-</sup>11<sup>++</sup> parasites, the duplicated chromosome 11 segments were identical to each other. Across parasites, multiple distinct haplotype groupings were consistent with emergence due to clonal expansion of progeny from intrastrain meiotic recombination. Together, these observations suggest negative selection normally removes 13<sup>-</sup>11<sup>++</sup> <italic>pfhrp3 deletions</italic>, and specific conditions are needed for their emergence and spread including low transmission, findings that can help refine surveillance strategies.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<sec id="s1a">
<title>P. falciparum malaria remains a leading cause of childhood mortality in Africa</title>
<p><italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> remains one of the most common causes of malaria and childhood mortality in Africa despite significant efforts to eradicate the disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. The latest report by the World Health Organization estimated 247 million cases of malaria and 619,000 fatalities in 2021 alone with the vast majority of deaths occurring in Africa<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>The mainstay of malaria diagnosis across Africa is no longer microscopy but rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) due to their simplicity and speed. Their swift adoption, now totaling hundreds of millions a year, coupled with effective artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) has led to significant progress in malaria control<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. The predominant and most sensitive falciparum malaria RDTs detect <italic>P. falciparum</italic> histidine-rich protein 2 (PfHRP2) and, to a lesser extent, its paralog PfHRP3 due to cross-reactivity.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s1b">
<title>Increasing numbers of pfhrp2 and pfhrp3-deleted parasites escaping diagnosis by RDTs</title>
<p>Unfortunately, a growing number of studies have reported laboratory and field isolates with deletions of <italic>pfhrp2</italic> (PF3D7_0831800) and <italic>pfhrp3</italic> (PF3D7_1372200) in the subtelomeric regions of chromosomes 8 and 13, respectively. The resulting lack of these proteins allows the parasite to fully escape diagnosis by PfHRP2-based RDTs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. Deleted parasites appear to be spreading rapidly in some regions and have compromised existing test-and-treat programs, especially in the Horn of Africa<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. The prevalence of parasites with <italic>pfhrp2</italic> and <italic>pfhrp3</italic> deletion varies markedly across continents and regions in a manner not explained by RDT use alone. Parasites with these deletions are well-established in areas where PfHRP2-based RDTs have never been used routinely such as parts of South America<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. Studies in Ethiopia, where false-negative RDTs owing to <italic>pfhrp2 and pfhrp3</italic> deletions are common, suggest that the <italic>pfhrp3</italic> deletion arose first given it is more prevalent and shows a shorter shared haplotype<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>. The reason why <italic>pfhrp3</italic> deletion occurred prior to <italic>pfhrp2</italic> remains unclear. A 1994 study of the HB3 laboratory strain reported frequent meiotic translocation of a <italic>pfhrp3</italic> deletion from chromosomes 13 to 11<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. Explanation of this mechanism, whether it might occur in natural populations, and how it relates to initial loss of <italic>pfhrp3</italic> has not been fully explored.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s1c">
<title>Precise pfhfp2 and pfhrp3 deletion mechanisms remain unknown</title>
<p>Studies of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> structural rearrangements are challenging and <italic>pfhrp2</italic> and <italic>pfhrp3</italic> deletions particularly so due to their position in complex subtelomeric regions. Subtelomeric regions represent roughly 5% of the genome, are unstable, and contain rapidly diversifying gene families (e.g., <italic>var</italic>, <italic>rifin</italic>, <italic>stevor</italic>) that undergo frequent conversion between chromosomes mediated by non-allelic homologous recombination (NAHR) and double-stranded breakage (DSB) and telomere healing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. Subtelomeric exchange importantly allows for unbalanced progeny without the usual deleterious ramifications of altering a larger proportion of a chromosome. Of note, newly formed duplications predispose to further duplications or other rearrangements through NAHR between highly identical paralogous regions. Together, this potentiates the rapid expansion of gene families and their spread across subtelomeric regions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>. The duplicative transposition of a subtelomeric region of one chromosome onto another chromosome frequently occurs in <italic>P. falciparum</italic>. Specifically, prior studies have found duplicative transposition events involving several genes including <italic>var2csa</italic> and <italic>cytochrome b</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>. Notably, <italic>pfhrp2</italic> and <italic>pfhrp3</italic> are adjacent to but not considered part of the subtelomeric regions, and recombination of <italic>var</italic> genes does not result in the deletion of <italic>pfhrp2</italic> and <italic>pfhrp3</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Telomere healing, de novo telomere addition via telomerase activity, is associated with subtelomeric deletion events in <italic>P. falciparum</italic> that involve chromosomal breakage and loss of all downstream genes. Healing serves to stabilize the end of the chromosome. Deletion of the <italic>P. falciparum</italic> knob-associated histidine-rich protein <italic>(KAHRP</italic> or <italic>pfhrp1)</italic> and <italic>pfhrp2</italic> genes via this mechanism was first reported to occur in laboratory isolates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>. Since then, studies have defined the critical role of telomerase in <italic>P. falciparum</italic> and additional occurrences affecting a number of genes including <italic>pfhrp1, Pf332,</italic> and <italic>Pf87</italic> in laboratory isolates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>. For <italic>pfhrp1</italic> and <italic>pfhrp2,</italic> this mechanism of deletion only occurred in laboratory isolates but not in clinical samples, suggesting the genes have important infections in normal infections and their loss is selected against<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>An improved understanding of the patterns and mechanisms of <italic>pfhrp2</italic> and <italic>pfhrp3</italic> deletions can provide important insights into how frequently they occur and the evolutionary pressures driving their emergence and help inform control strategies. Here, using available whole-genome sequences and additional long-read sequencing, we examined the pattern and nature of <italic>pfhrp2</italic> and <italic>pfhrp3</italic> deletions. Our findings shed light on geographical differences in <italic>pfhrp3</italic> deletion patterns, their mechanisms, and how they likely emerged, providing key information for improved surveillance.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<sec id="s2a">
<title>Pfhrp2 and pfhrp3 deletions in the global P. falciparum genomic dataset</title>
<p>We examined all publicly available Illumina whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data from global <italic>P. falciparum</italic> isolates as of January 2023, comprising 19,289 field samples and lab isolates (<bold>Table S1</bold>). We analyzed the genomic regions containing <italic>pfhrp2</italic> on chromosome 8 and <italic>pfhrp3</italic> on chromosome 13 to detect nucleotide and copy number variation (e.g., deletions and duplications) using local haplotype assembly and sequencing depth. Regions on chromosomes 5 and 11 associated with these duplicates were also analyzed (<bold>Table S2, Table S4, Methods)</bold>. We identified 27 parasites with <italic>pfhrp2</italic> deletion, 172 with <italic>pfhrp3</italic> deletion, and 21 with both <italic>pfhrp2</italic> and <italic>pfhrp3</italic> deletions. Across all regions, <italic>pfhrp3</italic> deletions were more common than <italic>pfhrp2</italic> deletions; specifically, <italic>pfhrp3</italic> deletions and <italic>pfhrp2</italic> deletions were present in Africa in 43 and 12, Asia in 53 and 4, and South America in 76 and 11 parasites. It should be noted that these numbers are not accurate measures of prevalence given that most WGS specimens have been collected based on RDT positivity.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2b">
<title>Pfhrp2 deletion associated with variable breakpoints and telomeric healing</title>
<p>We further examined the breakpoints of 27 parasites (25 patient parasites and 2 lab isolates) (<bold><xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Figure 1</xref></bold>). Twelve parasites showed evidence of breakage and telomeric healing as suggested by telomere-associated tandem repeat 1 (TARE-1)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup> sequence contiguous with the genomic sequence at locations where coverage drops to zero (<bold><xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Figure 2</xref></bold>). The majority of breakpoints occur within <italic>pfhrp2</italic>, found in 9 South American parasites and lab isolate D10 (<bold><xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Figure 2</xref></bold>). The other <italic>pfhrp2</italic>-deleted parasites did not have detectable TARE1 or evidence of genomic rearrangement but were amplified with sWGA, limiting the ability to detect the TARE1 sequence. Thus, <italic>pfhrp2</italic> deletion likely occurs solely through breakage events with subsequent telomeric healing.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2c">
<title>Three distinct pfhrp3 deletion patterns with geographical associations</title>
<p>Exploration of read depth revealed three distinct deletion copy number patterns associated with <italic>pfhrp3</italic> deletion (chromosome 13: 2,840,236-2,842,840): first, sole deletion of chromosome 13 starting at various locations centromeric to <italic>pfhrp3</italic> to the end of the chromosome with detectable TARE1 telomere healing and unassociated with other rearrangements (<bold>pattern 13<sup>-</sup></bold>); second, deletion of chromosome 13 from position 2,835,587 to the end of the chromosome and associated with duplication of a chromosome 5 segment from position 952,668 to 979,203, which includes <italic>pfmdr1</italic> (<bold>pattern 13<sup>-</sup>5<sup>++</sup></bold>); and third, deletion of chromosome 13 commencing just centromeric to <italic>pfhrp3</italic> and extending to the end of the chromosome and associated with duplication of the chromosome 11 subtelomeric region (<bold>pattern 13<sup>-</sup>11<sup>++</sup></bold>) (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref></bold>). Among the 172 parasites with <italic>pfhrp3</italic> deletion, 21 (12.2%) were pattern 13<sup>-</sup>, 29 (16.9%) were pattern 13<sup>-</sup>5<sup>++</sup>, and the majority with 122 (70.9%) demonstrated pattern 13<sup>-</sup>11<sup>++</sup>. Pattern 13<sup>-</sup>11<sup>++</sup> was almost exclusively found in parasites from Africa and the Americas, while 13<sup>-</sup>5<sup>++</sup> was only observed in Asia (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref></bold>).</p>

<title>Combined analysis of additional Nanopore and PacBio reads confirmed a segmental duplicated region of the normal chromosome 11 and hybrid chromosome 13-11</title>
<p>To better examine the genome structure of pattern 13<sup>-</sup>11<sup>++</sup>, we whole-genome sequenced the 13<sup>-</sup>11<sup>++</sup> isolates HB3 and SD01 with long-read Nanopore technology. We generated 7,350 Mb and 645 Mb of data representing an average coverage of 319x and 29.3x for HB3 and SD01, respectively.

<p>To directly map reads, we constructed 3D7-based representations of hybrid chromosomes 13-11 and 11-13 by joining the 3D7 chromosomal sequences at breakpoints in the middle of the segmental duplication (<bold>Methods</bold>). We then aligned all PacBio and Nanopore reads for each isolate to the normal and hybrid constructs to detect reads completely spanning the duplicated region extending at least 50bp into flanking unique regions (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref></bold>). HB3 had 77 spanning reads across normal chromosome 11 and 91 spanning reads across hybrid chromosome 13-11. SD01 had two chromosome 11 spanning reads and one 13-11 chromosome spanning read. SD01 had a small number of spanning reads due to lower overall Nanopore reads secondary to insufficient input sample. Further analysis on SD01 revealed 4 regions within this duplicated region that had chromosome 11 and 13-specific nucleotide variation, which was leveraged to further bridge across this region for additional confirmation given SD01’s low coverage (<bold><xref rid="figs20" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Figure 20</xref></bold> and <bold><xref rid="figs21" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Figure 21</xref></bold>).

<p>To further examine the parasites with hybrid 13-11 chromosomes and exclude potentially more complicated structural alterations involving other regions of the genome, <italic>de novo</italic> whole-genome assemblies were created for the HB3 and SD01 lab strains from Nanopore long reads. HB3 assembly yielded 16 contigs representing complete chromosomes (N50 1,5985,898 and L50 5).

SD01, however, with lower sequencing coverage, had a more disjointed assembly with 200 final contigs (N50 263,459, and L50 30). The HB3 and SD01 assemblies both had a chromosome 11 that closely matched normal 3D7 chromosome 11 and a separate hybrid 13-11 that closely matched 3D7 chromosome 13 until the ribosomal duplication region where it then subsequently best-matched chromosome 11 (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref></bold>, <bold><xref rid="figs22" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Figure 22</xref></bold>). HB3’s 11 and hybrid 13-11 chromosomes had TARE-1 at their ends<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>, indicating that these chromosomes were complete. These new assemblies were further annotated for genes by Companion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>. The contig matching the hybrid 13-11 for both strains essentially contained a duplicated portion of chromosome 11 telomeric to the ribosomal duplication. The duplicated genes within this segment included <italic>pf332</italic> (PF3D7_1149000), two ring erythrocyte surface antigens genes (PF3D7_1149200, PF3D7_1149500), three PHISTs genes, a FIKK family gene, and two hypothetical proteins and ended with a DnaJ gene (PF3D7_1149600) corresponding to 3D7 genes PF3D7_1148700 through PF3D7_1149600 (<bold><xref rid="figs23" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Figure 23</xref> and <xref rid="figs24" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Figure 24</xref></bold>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Here, we used publicly available short-read and long-read from parasites across the world and newly generated long-read sequencing data to identify <italic>pfhrp2</italic> and <italic>pfhrp3</italic> deletions and their mechanisms in field <italic>P. falciparum</italic> parasites. The limited number of <italic>pfhrp2</italic>-deleted strains showed chromosome 8 breakpoints predominantly in the gene with evidence of telomere healing, a common repair mechanism in <italic>P. falciparum</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. We found that <italic>pfhrp3</italic> deletions occurred through three different mechanisms. The least common mechanism was the simplest involving simple breakage loss of chromosome 13 from pfhrp3 to the telomere, followed by telomere healing (13<sup>-</sup> pattern). The second most common pattern 13<sup>-</sup>5<sup>++</sup> was likely the result of NAHR, within 20-28bp di-nucleotide AT repeats translocating a 26,535bp region of chromosome 5 containing <italic>pfmdr1</italic> onto chromosome 13, thereby duplicating <italic>pfmdr1</italic> and deleting <italic>pfhrp3</italic>. There appeared to be one origin of 13<sup>-</sup>5<sup>++</sup>, which was only observed in the Asia population, and its continued presence was potentially driven by the added benefit of <italic>pfmdr1</italic> duplication in the presence of mefloquine. The most common pattern, 13<sup>-</sup>11<sup>++</sup>, predominated in the Americas and Africa and was the result of NAHR between chromosome 11 and 13 within the large 15.2kb highly-identical ribosomal duplication, translocating and thereby duplicating 70,175bp of core chromosome 11 plus 15-87kb of paralogous sub-telomeric region replacing the chromosomal region on chromosome 13 that contained <italic>pfhrp3</italic>. Importantly, NAHR-mediated translocations resulting in deletion have repeatedly occurred based on evidence of multiple breakpoints and chromosome 11 haplotypes with identical copies in parasites. These findings combined with identical copies of the shared chromosome 11 segment suggest that these parasites represent multiple instances of intrastrain (self) NAHR-mediated translocation followed by clonal propagation of 13<sup>-</sup>11<sup>++</sup> progeny. While Hinterberg <italic>et al.</italic> proposed that a general mechanism of non-homologous recombination of the subtelomeric regions may be responsible for translocating the already existing deletion of <italic>pfhrp3</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>, our analysis would suggest ribosomal duplication-mediated NAHR is the likely cause of the <italic>pfhrp3</italic> deletion itself. The high frequency of the meiotic translocation in the laboratory cross further supports the hypothesis that these NAHR-mediated translocations are occurring at a high frequency in meiosis in natural populations. Consequently, this suggests that progeny must be strongly selected against in natural populations apart from where specific conditions exist, allowing for <italic>pfhrp3</italic> deletion to emerge and expand (e.g. South America and the Horn of Africa).</p>
<p>Positive selection due to drug resistance may underlie pattern 13<sup>-</sup>5<sup>++</sup> translocation that duplicates <italic>pfmdr1</italic> onto chromosome 13. In South East Asia, the only place containing pattern 13<sup>-</sup>5<sup>++</sup>, existing tandem duplications of <italic>pfmdr1</italic> exist that provide mefloquine resistance, and mefloquine has been used extensively as an artemisinin partner drug, unlike Africa<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>. Discordant reads, local assembly, and TARE1 identification support NAHR-mediated translocation of <italic>pfmdr1</italic> followed by telomeric healing to create a functional chromosome. All strains showed the same exact NAHR breakpoint and TARE1 localization consistent with a single origin event giving rise to all 13-5++ parasites. Interestingly, <italic>pfmdr1</italic> duplications have been shown to be unstable with both increases and decreases in copy numbers frequently occurring<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>. During de-amplification, a free fragment of DNA containing a <italic>pfmdr1</italic> copy may have been the substrate that integrated into chromosome 13 by NAHR, followed by telomerase healing to stabilize the 13-5 hybrid chromosome, analogous to <italic>var</italic> gene recombination events where double-stranded DNA is displaced, becoming highly recombinogenic<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. A clonal expansion of 13<sup>-</sup>5<sup>++</sup> parasites could be due to the benefit of the extra <italic>pfmdr1</italic> copy on chromosome 13, the loss of <italic>pfhrp3</italic>, or both. Its expansion in SEA would be consistent with selection due to copy-number-associated mefloquine resistance given mefloquine’s extensive use as an individual and artemisinin partner drug in the region. Furthermore, given all isolates with evidence of this duplication either had only wild-type <italic>pfmdr1</italic> or were mixed, the 13-5 chromosome copy most likely had wild-type <italic>pfmdr1</italic>. In 20 out of 27 <italic>pfmdr1</italic> duplication cases with a mixed genotype of <italic>pfmdr1</italic> (<bold><xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Figure 5</xref></bold>), the core genome <italic>pfmdr1</italic> had the Y184F mutation with no other mutations detected within the <italic>pfmdr1</italic> gene. Isolates containing only Y184F in <italic>pfmdr1</italic> were shown to be outgrown by wild-type <italic>pfmdr1</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>, which would mean having the wild-type <italic>pfmdr1</italic> duplication on chromosome 13 might confer a stable (non-tandem) “heterozygous” survival advantage beyond just increased copy number-mediated resistance to mefloquine.</p>
<p>To confirm the NAHR event between 11 and 13 leading to loss of <italic>pfhrp3</italic> observed in our analysis of short-read data, we long-read sequenced <italic>pfhrp3</italic> deleted lab isolates, HB3 and SD01, to generate reads spanning the 15kb duplicated region, showing support for a normal chromosome 11 and a hybrid 13-11 in both isolates. These findings supported an NAHR event between the two 15kb duplicated regions causing this interchromosomal exchange and leading to progeny with a hybrid 13-11 chromosome lacking <italic>pfhrp3</italic> and its surrounding genes from the 15kb duplicated region and onwards (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref></bold> and <bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref></bold>). This was consistent with the genomic coverage pattern we observed in publicly available data from 122 <italic>pfhrp3-</italic>deleted field samples (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref></bold>). Such translocation patterns have been described and also confirmed by long-read sequencing but have generally involved multigene families such as <italic>var</italic> genes within the subtelomeres<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. The event described here represented a much larger section of loss/duplication of 70kb of the core genome in addition to the subtelomere.</p>
<p>We propose a mechanistic model in which homology misalignment and recombination between chromosomes 11 and 13 initially occurs in an oocyst from identical parasites predominately in low transmission settings, resulting in four potential progeny including one with normal chromosomes 11 and 13 and three with translocations <bold>(<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>)</bold>. This could account for the identical haplotypes observed in the two copies of the chromosome 11 segment. Based on the identical haplotypes observed in the majority of parasites, the most direct and likely mechanism involves progeny with two copies of chromosome 11 recombining with an unrelated strain to yield unrelated chromosome 11 haplotypes. This duplication-mediated NAHR event occurs frequently during meiosis and can explain the frequent rearrangements seen between chromosomes 11 and 13 in the previous experimental cross of HB3 x DD2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. Meiotic misalignment and subsequent NAHR is a common cause of high-frequency chromosomal rearrangements including in human disease (eg. in humans, 22q11 deletion syndrome due to misalignment of duplicated blocks on chromosome 22 occurs in 1 in 4000 births)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>. This high frequency could explain why <italic>pfhrp3</italic>-deleted isolates are more common in many populations relative to pfhrp2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>, which likely requires infrequent random breaks along with rescue by telomere healing. In the future, more extensive sequencing of RDT-negative <italic>P. falciparum</italic> parasites is needed to confirm that there are no other deletion mechanisms responsible for <italic>pfhrp2</italic> loss.</p>

<caption><title>Proposed model of duplication-mediated non-allelic homologous recombination during intrastrain meiotic recombination yielding 13<sup>-</sup>11<sup>++</sup> parasites.</title>
<p>Homology misalignment and NAHR between chromosomes 11 and 13 first occur in an oocyst formed from identical parasite gametes (intrastrain), which can then segregate, resulting in potential progeny (normal and 3 translocated progeny). Bold lines show the most direct path to a 13<sup>-</sup>11<sup>++</sup> parasite containing a 13-11 hybrid chromosome lacking <italic>pfhrp3</italic> and two identical copies of duplicated chromosome 11 segment seen predominantly. Subsequent recombination with an unrelated strain yields parasites with differing chromosome 11 duplication haplotypes but this can occur with subsequent interstrain meioses. Additionally, there is potential for balanced products, occurring with subsequent recombination events leading to <italic>pfhrp3</italic> loss and either identical haplotypes (intrastrain) or different haplotypes (unrelated strain). The 11<sup>-</sup>13<sup>++</sup> coverage pattern consistent with an 11-13 hybrid chromosome was observed once in a lab strain (FCR3), confirming it can form and thereby supporting that in vivo selective constraints prevent its emergence.

<p>The lack of hybrid chromosome 13-11 worldwide suggests such events are normally quickly removed from the population due to fitness costs, an idea supported by recent <italic>in vitro</italic> competition studies in culture showing decreased fitness of <italic>pfhrp2/3-</italic>deleted parasites<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup>. This decreased fitness of parasites with <italic>pfhrp2/3</italic> deletions also argues against a mitotic origin as deletions arising after meiosis would have to compete against more numerous and more fit intact parasites. Additionally, <italic>pfhrp3</italic> deletions arising in culture have not been observed. The fact that abundant <italic>pfhrp3</italic> deletions have only been observed in low-transmission areas where within-infection competition is rare is consistent with this hypothesis of within-infection competition suppressing emergence. In the setting of RDT use, existing <italic>pfhrp3</italic> deletions in such a low-transmission environment may provide a genetic background on which less frequent <italic>pfhrp2</italic> deletion events can occur, leading to a fully RDT-negative parasite. This is supported by evidence that <italic>pfhrp3</italic> deletion appears to predate <italic>pfhrp2</italic> deletions in the Horn of Africa<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>The biological effects of <italic>pfhrp2</italic> and <italic>pfhrp3</italic> loss and potential selective forces are complicated due to other genes lost and gained and the extent of the rearrangements. Increased copies of genes on chromosome 11 could be beneficial, as <italic>pf332</italic> on the chromosome 11 duplicated segment was found to be essential for the binding of the Maurer cleft to the erythrocyte skeleton and is highly expressed in patients with cerebral malaria<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup>. Conversely, lack of this protein is likely detrimental to survival and may be the reason the reciprocal hybrid 11-13 was not observed in field isolates. Only lab isolate FCR3 had any indication from coverage data that it had a duplicated chromosome 13 and a deleted chromosome 11. Given that the majority of the publicly available field samples were collected from studies using RDT-positive samples and that RDT would have likely detected the increased PfHRP3 encoded by duplicated pfhrp3, sampling should not be biased against detecting parasites with this reciprocal hybrid 11-13. Thus, the lack of 11-13 rearrangement in field isolates suggests that the selective disadvantage of the lost and gained genes was strong enough to prevent its emergence in the natural parasite population.</p>
<p>While further studies are needed to determine the reasons for these geographical patterns of <italic>pfhrp3</italic> deletions, our results provide an improved understanding of the mechanism of structural variation underlying <italic>pfhrp3</italic> deletion. They also suggest general constraints against emergence in high-transmission regions due to within-host competition and that there are likely further specific requirements for emergence in low-transmission settings. If selective constraints of <italic>pfhrp2</italic> and <italic>pfhrp3</italic> deletions are similar, the high frequency of the NAHR-mediated loss and the additional drug pressure from duplication of <italic>pfmdr1</italic> may explain why <italic>pfhrp3</italic> loss precedes <italic>pfhrp2</italic> loss despite RDT pressure presumably exerting stronger survival advantage with loss of <italic>pfhrp2</italic> versus <italic>pfhrp3</italic>. However, given we still have a limited understanding of their biological roles, there may be situations where selective forces may favor loss of <italic>pfhrp2</italic> relative to <italic>pfhrp3</italic>. Overall, our findings are clinically important, because continued loss of these genes without timely intervention may result in a rapid decrease in the sensitivity of HRP2-based RDTs. Future studies focused on these deletions including representative sampling are needed to determine the prevalence, interactions, and impacts of <italic>pfhrp2</italic> and <italic>pfhrp3</italic> deletions and to examine the selective pressures and complex biology underlying them.</p>

<title>Genomic locations and read-depth analysis</title>
<p>Conserved non-paralogous genomic regions surrounding <italic>pfhrp2</italic> and <italic>pfhrp3</italic> were determined to study the genomic deletions encompassing these genes. This was accomplished by first marking the 3D7 genome with the program tandem repeat finder<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup>, then taking 200bp windows, stepping every 100bp between these tandem repeats, and using LASTZ<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup>(version 1.04.22) to align these regions against the reference genome 3D7 (version 3, 2015-06-18) and 10 currently available chromosomal-level PacBio assembled genomes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup> that lacked <italic>pfhrp2</italic> and <italic>pfhrp3 deletions</italic>. Regions that aligned at &gt;70% identity in each genome only once were kept, and overlapping regions were then merged. Regions from within the duplicated region on chromosome 11 and chromosome 13 were kept if they aligned to either chromosome 11 or 13 but not to other chromosomes. Local haplotype reconstruction was performed on each region for 19,289 publicly available whole genome sequences (WGS) of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> field samples, including 24 samples from a recent study in Ethiopia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup> where <italic>pfhrp2-/3-</italic> parasites are common. The called haplotypes were compared to determine which subregions contained variation in order to genotype each chromosome (<bold><xref rid="figs25" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Figure 25</xref></bold>). Coverage was determined for each genomic region by dividing the read depth of a region by the median read depth across the whole genome within each sample.

<title>Tandem repeat associated element 1 (TARE1) analysis and telomere healing determination</title>
<p>The 7bp pattern of TT[CT]AGGG<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup> was used to determine the presence of TARE1, of which the presence of this pattern was required to occur at least twice in tandem. To search for the presence of TARE1 within the short read Illumina WGS datasets, reads from the entire regions of interest were pulled down across chromosomes 5, 8, 11, and 13, and the above TARE1 pattern was searched for in each read. Regions that had TARE1 detected in their reads were then assembled to ensure the TARE1 sequence was contiguous with the genomic region from which the reads were pulled. The regions that had the presence of TARE1 contiguous with genomic regions were then compared to the coverage pattern within the area, and a parasite was marked as having evidence of telomere healing if TARE1 was detected in the regions where coverage then dropped to 0, or down to the genomic coverage of the rest of the genome in the case of the chromosome 5 duplication.</p>

The <italic>P. falciparum</italic> lab isolate HB3/Honduras (MRA-155) was obtained from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases’ BEI Resources Repository, while the field strain SD01/Sudan was obtained from the Department of Cellular and Applied Infection Biology at Rheinisch-Westfälische Technische Hochschule (RWTH) Aachen University in Germany. Nanopore base-calling was done with Guppy version 5.0.7. Genome assemblies were performed with Canu<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></sup>, an assembly pipeline for high-noise single-molecule sequencing, and Flye<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref></sup> using default settings.

The parasites with green have TARE1 detected on chromosome 13 that are clustered on the bottom of the graph and have normal coverage across this region of chromosome 5, while the parasites on top have evidence of re-arrangement between chromosome 13 (position 2,835,587) and chromosome 5 (position 979,203) and show increased coverage across chromosome 5 up to the point where TARE1 sequence is detected on the reverse strand. The second annotation pink bar from the top indicates the duplicated region. The beginning of this bar is where the TARE1 sequence on the reverse strand is detected. The above would be consistent with a genomic rearrangement between chromosome 13 at position 2,835,587 and chromosome 5 at position 979,203, which results in the deletion of chromosome 13 from 2,835,587 onwards and the duplication of a 26KB region of the reverse strand of chromosome 5 from position 979,203 to 952,668 resulting in the duplication of <italic>pfmdr1</italic> and the deletion of <italic>pfhrp3</italic>. The parasites that had transposition evidence between 13 and 5 but no TARE1 detected on 5 were all sWGA parasites, which likely limited the ability to detect the TARE1 sequence.

<p>This <bold>valuable</bold> study investigates likely molecular mechanisms underlying the increasingly common deletions of the hrp2 and hrp3 genes of the human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum, that render parasites undetectable by widely used rapid diagnostic tests. The generation of additional long-read data, alongside a new analysis of 19,000 public short-read sequenced genomes, makes this the most detailed investigation currently available on this topic. The authors provide <bold>solid</bold> evidence for chromosomal breakage with subsequent telomere healing as the mechanism for hrp2 deletion, with more complex patterns for hrp3 deletion, but further methodological details would bolster confidence in the conclusions and enable replication of the results.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
Deletion of the hrp2 and hrp3 loci in P. falciparum poses an immediate public health threat. This manuscript provides a more complete understanding of the dynamic nature with which these deletions are generated. By delving into the likely mechanisms behind their generation, the authors also provide interesting insight into general Plasmodium biology that can inform our broader understanding of the parasite's genomic evolution.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
The sub-telomeric regions of P. falciparum (where hrp2 and hrp3 are located) are notoriously difficult to study with short-read sequence data. The authors take an appropriate, targeted approach toward studying the loci of interest, which includes read-depth analysis and local haplotype reconstruction. They additionally use both long-read and short-read data to validate their major findings. There is an extensive set of supplementary plots, which helps clarify several aspects of the data.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
In this first version, there are a few factors that hinder a full assessment of the robustness and replicability of the results. First, a number of the analyses lack basic details in the methods; for instance, one must visit the authors' personal website to find some of the tools used. Second, there are several tricky methodological points that are not fully documented. Read depths are treated (and plotted) discretely as 0/1/2 without any discussion of how thresholds were used and determined. For read mapping to standard vs hybrid chromosomes, there is no documentation on how assignments were made if partially ambiguous or how final sample calls were determined when some reads were discordant. There is no mention of how missing data were handled. Without this, it is difficult to know when conclusions were based on analyses that were more quantitative (for instance, using pre-determined read thresholds) or more subjective (with patterns being extracted visually). Third, while a new method is employed for local haplotype reconstruction (PathWeaver), the manuscript does not include details on this approach or benchmarking data with which to evaluate its performance and understand any potential artifacts.</p>

<p>This work investigates the mechanisms, patterns, and geographical distribution of pfhrp2 and pfhrp3 deletions in Plasmodium falciparum. Rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) detect P. falciparum histidine-rich protein 2 (PfHRP2) and its paralog PfHRP3 located in subtelomeric regions. However, laboratory and field isolates with deletions of pfhrp2 and pfhrp3 that can escape diagnosis by RDTs are spreading in some regions of Africa. They find that pfhrp2 deletions are less common and likely occur through chromosomal breakage with subsequent telomeric healing. Pfhrp3 deletions are more common and show three distinct patterns: loss of chromosome 13 from pfhrp3 to the telomere with evidence of telomere healing at breakpoint (Asia; Pattern 13-); duplication of a chromosome 5 segment containing pfhrp1 on chromosome 13 through non-allelic homologous recombination (NAHR) (Asia; Pattern 13-5++); and the most common pattern, duplication of a chromosome 11 segment on chromosome 13 through NAHR (Americas/Africa; Pattern 13-11++). The loss of these genes impacts the sensitivity of RDTs, and knowing these patterns and geographic distribution makes it possible to make better decisions for malaria control.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
The study provides a detailed analysis of the chromosomal rearrangements related to the deletions of histidine-rich protein 2 (pfhrp2) and pfhrp3 genes in P. falciparum that have clinical significance since malaria rapid diagnostic tests detect these parasite proteins. A large number of publicly available short sequence reads for the whole genome of the parasite were analyzed, and data on coverage and discordant mapping allowed the authors to identify deletions, duplications, and chromosomal rearrangements related to pfhrp3 deletions. Long-read sequences showed support for the presence of a normal chromosome 11 and a hybrid 13-11 chromosome lacking pfhrp3 in some of the pfhrp3-deleted parasites. The findings support that these translocations have repeatedly occurred in natural populations. The authors discuss the implications of these findings and how they do or do not support previous hypotheses on the emergence of these deletions and the possible selective pressures involved.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
The genomic regions where these genes are located are challenging to study since they are highly repetitive and paralogous and the use of long-read sequencing allowed to span the duplicated regions, giving support to the identification of the hybrid 13-11 chromosome.</p>
<p>All publicly available whole-genome sequences of the malaria parasite from around the world were analysed which allowed an overview of the worldwide variability, even though this analysis is biased by the availability of sequences, as the authors recognize.</p>
<p>Despite the reduced sample size, the detailed analysis of haplotypes and identification of the location of breakpoints gives support to a single origin event for the 13-5++ parasites.</p>
<p>The analysis of haplotype variation across the duplicated chromosome-11 segment identified breakpoints at varied locations that support multiple translocation events in natural populations. The authors suggest these translocations may be occurring at high frequency in meiosis in natural populations but are strongly selected against in most circumstances, which remains to be tested.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
Relying on sequence data publicly available, that were collected based on diagnostic test positivity and that are limited by sequencing availability, limits the interpretation of the occurrence and relative frequency of the deletions. In the discussion, caution is needed when identifying the least common and most common mechanisms and their geographical associations. The identification of only one type of deletion pattern for Pfhrp2 may be related to these biases.</p>
<p>The specific objectives of the study are not stated clearly, and it is sometimes difficult to know which findings are new to this study. Is it the first study analyzing all the worldwide available sequences? Is it the first one to do long-read sequencing to span the entire duplicated region?</p>
<p>Another aspect that should be explained in the introduction is that there was previous information about the association of the deletions to patterns found in chromosomes 5 and 11. In the short-read sequences results, it is not clear if these chromosomes were analysed because of the associations found in this study (and no associations were found to putative duplications or deletions in other chromosomes), or if they were specifically included in the analysis because of the previous information (and the other chromosomes were not analysed).</p>
<p>An interesting statement in the discussion is that existing pfhrp3 deletions in a low-transmission environment may provide a genetic background on which less frequent pfhrp2 deletion events can occur. Does it mean that the occurrence of pfhrp3 deletions would favor the pfhrp2 deletion events? How, and is there any evidence for that?</p>
