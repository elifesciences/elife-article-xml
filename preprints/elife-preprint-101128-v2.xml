<title>Abstract</title><p>Babesiosis is a disease brought on by intraerythrocytic parasites of the genus <italic>Babesia</italic>. Current chemotherapies are accompanied by side effects and parasite relapse. Therefore, it is crucial to develop highly effective drugs against <italic>Babesia</italic>. Cipargamin (CIP) has shown inhibition against apicomplexan parasites, mainly <italic>Plasmodium</italic> and <italic>Toxoplasma</italic>. This study evaluated the growth-inhibiting properties of CIP against <italic>Babesia</italic> spp. and investigated the mechanism of CIP on <italic>B. gibsoni</italic>. The half inhibitory concentration (IC<sub>50</sub>) values of CIP against the <italic>in vitro</italic> growth of <italic>B. bovis</italic> and <italic>B. gibsoni</italic> were 20.2 ± 1.4 nM and 69.4 ± 2.2 nM, respectively. CIP significantly inhibited the growth of <italic>B. microti</italic> and <italic>B. rodhaini in vivo.</italic> Resistance was conferred by L921V and L921I mutations in <italic>Bg</italic>ATP4, which reduced the sensitivity to CIP by 6.1- and 12.8-fold. The inhibitory potency of CIP against <italic>Bg</italic>ATP4-associated ATPase activity was moderately reduced in mutant strains, with a 1.3-fold and 2.4-fold decrease in <italic>Bg</italic>ATP4<sup>L921V</sup> and <italic>Bg</italic>ATP4<sup>L921I</sup> compared to that of <italic>Bg</italic>ATP4<sup>WT</sup>, respectively. An <italic>in silico</italic> investigation revealed reductions in affinity for CIP binding to <italic>Bg</italic>ATP4<sup>L921V</sup> and <italic>Bg</italic>ATP4<sup>L921I</sup> compared to <italic>Bg</italic>ATP4<sup>WT</sup>. Resistant strains showed no significant cross-resistance to atovaquone (ATO) or tafenoquine (TQ), with less than a onefold change in IC<sub>50</sub> values. Combining CIP with TQ effectively eliminated <italic>B. microti</italic> infection in SCID mice, no relapse, and parasite DNA was not detected by qPCR within 90 days post-infection. Our findings reveal the efficacy of CIP as an anti-babesial agent, its limitations as a monotherapy due to resistance development, and the potential of combination therapy with TQ to overcome resistance and achieve complete parasite clearance.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p><italic>Babesia</italic> is an apicomplexan tick-transmitted hemoparasite, which not only impacts the livestock economy but also causes an emerging disease in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Jalovecka et al., 2019</xref>). <italic>Babesia</italic> is a global pathogen that is more prevalent in certain regions such as Asia, Europe, and North America. However, as climate change brings with it higher temperatures and humidity, ticks and their reservoir hosts are anticipated to expand northward for survival and activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Gray and Ogden, 2021</xref>). The disease is known as babesiosis, commonly characterized by fever and hemolytic anemia, but chronic infections can be asymptomatic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Almazán et al., 2022</xref>). The fatality rate ranges from 1% among all cases to 3% among hospitalized cases, and as high as 20% in immunocompromised patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Krause, 2019</xref>).</p>
<p>Currently, the most common drugs for the treatment of human babesiosis include a combination of atovaquone (ATO) plus azithromycin (AZI) or clindamycin (CLN) plus quinine (QUI) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Krause et al., 2021</xref>). Still, these recommended treatments often result in various problems. For instance, multiple mutations in the <italic>B. microti</italic> cytochrome b, which is targeted by ATO, were identified in patients with relapsing babesiosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Holbrook et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Krause et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Lemieux et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Marcos et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Rogers et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Rosenblatt et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Simon et al., 2017</xref>). The combination of CLN and QUI is the last resort for patients with severe symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Kletsova et al., 2017</xref>). Despite its efficacy, this combination can elicit adverse drug reactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Vannier and Krause, 2012</xref>). The 8-aminoquinoline analog tafenoquine (TQ) was found to be effective in curing immunocompromised patients experiencing relapsing babesiosis caused by <italic>B. microti</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Rogers et al., 2023</xref>). However, the efficacy of TQ treatment may vary between individuals and cases and its contraindication in patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency limits its clinical use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Chu and Freedman, 2019</xref>). Due to the aforementioned issues, it is undoubtedly urgent to search for compounds that treat infections caused by <italic>Babesia</italic> spp. while simultaneously minimizing the detrimental side effects of antibabesial drugs.</p>
<p>Spiroindolone cipargamin (CIP), a promising antimalarial, has been found to effectively suppress the growth of all strains of <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> and <italic>P. vivax</italic> with potency in the low nanomolar ranges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Rosling et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Rottmann et al., 2010</xref>). The assessment of the drug indicated that CIP taken orally had good absorption, a long half-life, and exceptional bioavailability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Schmitt et al., 2022</xref>). Following oral CIP treatment (30 mg daily for three days) in adults with simple <italic>P. falciparum</italic> or <italic>P. vivax</italic> malaria, parasitemia was rapidly cleared in a phase II trial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Schmitt et al., 2022</xref>). Currently, a clinical trial is being conducted for the intravenous administration of CIP as a treatment for severe malaria patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">ClinicalTrials, 2024</xref>). CIP was also evaluated for treating toxoplasmosis as a second-line medicine in cases where there are intolerable toxicity issues or allergies to the currently used treatments. Mice infected with <italic>T. gondii</italic> that were treated with CIP on the day of infection and the following day had 90% fewer parasites five days post-infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Zhou et al., 2014</xref>).</p>
<p><italic>Pf</italic>ATP4, a P-type ATPase in <italic>P. falciparum</italic>, functions as a Na⁺/H⁺ transporter critical for maintaining ionic balance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Spillman et al., 2013</xref>). Mutations in <italic>Pf</italic>ATP4 confer resistance to CIP, which disrupts Na⁺ homeostasis, leading to increased cytosolic Na⁺ concentration and various physiological changes, such as cytosolic alkalinization, osmotic swelling, etc. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Mohring et al., 2022</xref>). These mutations reduce the Na⁺-dysregulating effects of CIP and the resting Na⁺ levels. While <italic>Pf</italic>ATP4 is essential for <italic>P. falciparum</italic> survival, its homolog in <italic>T. gondii</italic> (<italic>Tg</italic>ATP4) is less critical, as <italic>T. gondii</italic> experiences brief, high Na⁺ exposure and can survive without <italic>Tg</italic>ATP4 expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Lehane et al., 2019</xref>).</p>
<p>Due to its excellent efficacy against other apicomplexan parasites, including <italic>Plasmodium</italic> spp., and its ability to target parasite ATP4—a conserved protein essential for ion homeostasis in apicomplexan organisms—we hypothesize that CIP could also effectively inhibit <italic>Babesia</italic> spp., a related apicomplexan parasite. Therefore, the objectives of this study were to determine whether CIP could inhibit the growth of <italic>Babesia</italic> spp., namely <italic>B. bovis</italic> and <italic>B. gibsoni in vitro</italic> and <italic>B. microti</italic> and <italic>B. rodhaini in vivo</italic>, and identify the inhibitory mechanisms of CIP on <italic>Babesia</italic> parasites.</p>

<p><italic>In vitro</italic> efficacy of CIP against <italic>B. bovis</italic> and <italic>B. gibsoni</italic> showed a steep growth inhibition curve with half inhibitory concentration (IC<sub>50</sub>) values of 20.2 ± 1.4 nM (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>) and 69.4 ± 2.2 nM (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>), respectively. The 50% cytotoxic concentration (CC<sub>50</sub>) value of CIP on Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells and human foreskin fibroblasts (HFF) were 38.7 ± 2.0 μM and 70.8 ± 4.9 μM (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure supplement 1</xref>), respectively. Based on these values, the predicted selectivity indices (SIs), which reflect the drug’s safety and specificity, were calculated to be greater than 500. Furthermore, at a concentration of 100 μM, CIP exhibited a low erythrocyte hemolysis rate of 0.11 ± 0.03 % (data not shown).</p>

<title>CIP effect on B. microti and B. rodhaini infections in vivo</title>
<p>Concurrently, CIP showed effective inhibition on <italic>B. microti</italic> and <italic>B. rodhaini in vivo</italic>. The parasitemia of <italic>B. microti</italic>-infected BALB/c mice increased dramatically in the vehicle-treated control group and peaked at 10 days postinfection (DPI) (38.55 ± 4.32%) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). On the other hand, seven days of treatment with CIP (20 mg/kg) or atovaquone (ATO) plus azithromycin (AZI) administered orally resulted in a significantly lower peak parasitemia, 1.06 ± 0.20% and 1.61 ± 0.20%, respectively (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). Hematocrit (HCT) variations were tracked every 4 days as an indicator of anemia in <italic>B. microti</italic>-infected mice. The vehicle-treated group showed a drop in HCT levels at 12 DPI and 16 DPI (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>). No significant reduction in HCT levels was observed in the CIP-treated group or the ATO plus AZI-treated group (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>). This indicates that the administration of CIP could control <italic>B. microti</italic> infection and prevent anemia from developing in <italic>B. microti</italic>-infected mice. BALB/c mice infected with <italic>B. rodhaini</italic> treated with sesame oil or ATO plus AZI showed high parasitemia, 90.73 ± 1.97%, and 86.23 ± 3.06%, respectively (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>), and all mice died within 8 DPI (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>). CIP treatment in <italic>B. rodhaini</italic>-infected mice precluded the emergence of parasitemia for the following eight days (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>), which led to 66.67% of mice surviving the challenge infection (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>). At 12 DPI, parasites had recurred in all CIP-treated <italic>B. rodhaini</italic>-infected mice (10.32 ± 15.51%), which were eventually cleared as indicated by undetectable parasites at 18 DPI (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>).</p>

<title>Identification of <italic>B. gibsoni</italic> ATP4 mutation in CIP-resistant strains</title>
<p>After being exposed to CIP at increasing concentrations up to 10 times the IC<sub>50</sub>, the resistant parasites in two of the culture wells were able to regrow. We sequenced the <italic>B. gibsoni</italic> ATP4 gene from the wild-type and two resistant strains. The wild-type strain has a C at nucleotide 2,761, which translates to leucine (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). In one resistant strain, a single nucleotide variant (SNV) in <italic>Bg</italic>ATP4 with a substitution at position 2,761 (from C to G) was found − a nonsynonymous coding change from leucine to valine (L921V) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). In another resistant strain, the mutation occurred in the same position. However, the nucleotide substitution was from C to A, and the coding changed from leucine to isoleucine (L921I) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>). Next-generation sequencing (NGS) revealed that for <italic>Bg</italic>ATP4<sup>L921V</sup>, 99.97% of 7,960 reads were G at nucleotide 2,761, and for <italic>Bg</italic>ATP4<sup>L921I</sup>, 99.92% of 7,862 reads were A at nucleotide 2,761 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>). <italic>Bg</italic>ATP4<sup>L921V</sup> and <italic>Bg</italic>ATP4<sup>L921I</sup> lines were tested for their susceptibility to CIP, and had IC<sub>50</sub> values of 421.0 ± 15.9 nM and 887.9 ± 62.0 nM, respectively (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>).

<title>The effect of CIP on <italic>Bg</italic>ATP4<sup>WT</sup>, <italic>Bg</italic>ATP4<sup>L921V</sup> and <italic>Bg</italic>ATP4<sup>L921I</sup> function</title>
<p>Microscopic observation of thin blood smears was performed to determine the morphological changes of <italic>B. gibsoni</italic> exposed to CIP. The CIP-treated parasites became swollen after incubation with the drug for 72 h (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). For both the treatment and control groups, one hundred parasites were measured. The mean size of treated parasites was notably bigger than the parasites in the untreated group (<italic>P</italic> ˂ 0.0001) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). Significant vacuolization was observed in the cytoplasm of parasites in the CIP-treated group, as revealed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Despite this, the nuclear membrane structure and parasitic membranes remained intact until the parasites were completely destroyed (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>). The addition of the ATP4 inhibitor CIP resulted in a time-dependent increase in the concentrations of [Na<sup>+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> in wild-type <italic>B. gibsoni</italic>, with improved signal-to-noise ratios at the higher drug concentration of 20 nM (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>). We observed that the Na<sup>+</sup> concentrations in both <italic>Bg</italic>ATP4<sup>L921V</sup> and <italic>Bg</italic>ATP4<sup>L921I</sup> lines were lower when compared with those of the control <italic>Bg</italic>ATP4<sup>WT</sup> line after being exposed to 20 nM CIP for 20 min, with a significantly lower Na<sup>+</sup> concentration in <italic>Bg</italic>ATP4<sup>L921I</sup> (<italic>P</italic> = 0.0087) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref>). We also demonstrated here that the addition of CIP in wild-type <italic>B. gibsoni</italic> caused an increase in the cytosolic pH (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>). Specifically, 4 min after the drug was added, the average pH of 20 nM CIP group reached as high as 7.278, while the 1 nM CIP group reached 7.089 and the untreated group reached 7.062 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>). The pH values of the 20 nM CIP group were consistently higher than those of the other two groups, although declining with time (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>). In resistant lines, a 20-min exposure to 20 nM CIP caused small changes in the pH values compared to the wild-type line, with the <italic>Bg</italic>ATP4<sup>L921I</sup> line (7.048 ± 0.042) having a notably lower pH value (<italic>P</italic> = 0.0229) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3G</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The repositioning of antimalarial drugs is critical in developing novel strategies for treating babesiosis. CIP is a novel compound that inhibits <italic>Plasmodium</italic> development by targeting ATP4 and has been extensively tested in Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Qiu et al., 2022</xref>). Since ATP4 is conserved across apicomplexans, including <italic>Babesia</italic> species, our study aimed to repurpose the antimalarial CIP by assessing its efficacy on <italic>Babesia</italic> species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Lehane et al., 2019</xref>). The IC<sub>50</sub> values of CIP against <italic>B. bovis</italic> and <italic>B. gibsoni in vitro</italic> were lower than the previously reported IC<sub>50</sub> value of TQ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Carvalho et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Ji et al., 2022b</xref>) and ATO against <italic>B. gibsoni</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Matsuu et al., 2004</xref>). The present investigation also demonstrated that the inhibitory effects of CIP on <italic>B. microti</italic>-infected BALB/c mice were comparable to that of ATO plus AZI, the combination recommended by the CDC in the United States. CIP was also proven to protect mice from the deadly <italic>B. rodhaini</italic> infection, with survival up to 67%, as recorded in the current trial. These results suggest that CIP may be a potential chemotherapy candidate for babesiosis.</p>
<p>In a previous study, the <italic>P. falciparum</italic> Dd2 strain that acquired resistance to CIP carried the G358S mutation in the <italic>Pf</italic>ATP4 protein, a <italic>P. falciparum</italic> P-type Na<sup>+</sup> ATPase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Qiu et al., 2022</xref>). The vital protein ATP4 is found in the parasite plasma membrane and is specific to the subclass of apicomplexan parasites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Mohring et al., 2022</xref>). To date, <italic>in vitro</italic> evolution experiments using CIP have produced at least 18 parasite lines with various <italic>Pf</italic>ATP4 mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Lee and Fidock, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Rottmann et al., 2010</xref>). In another study involving <italic>T. gondii</italic>, a cell line that carried the mutation G419S in the <italic>Tg</italic>ATP4 gene was 34 times less susceptible to CIP than that of <italic>Tg</italic>ATP4<sup>WT</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Qiu et al., 2022</xref>). It follows that there is a significant chance that the resistant <italic>Babesia</italic> parasites will also emerge from CIP exposure. In this study, we successfully produced two CIP-resistant strains using six independent selections. The newly discovered L921V and L921I mutations in <italic>Bg</italic>ATP4 decreased the CIP sensitivity by 6.1 and 12.8 times, respectively. We provided compelling evidence that natural variety mutations L921V and L921I in <italic>Bg</italic>ATP4 significantly affected the protein’s susceptibility to CIP inhibition, albeit the mutational sites were different from those of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> and <italic>T. gondii</italic>. Based on our observation, the growth and generation rates of the mutant strains are comparable to those of the wild-type strain.</p>
<p>Although ATP4 was initially recognized as a Ca<sup>2+</sup> transporter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Krishna et al., 2001</xref>), current evidence suggests that ATP4 functions as an ATPase for exporting Na<sup>+</sup> while importing H<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Mohring et al., 2022</xref>), as well as causing a variety of other physiological perturbations including an increase in the volume of parasites and infected erythrocytes, due to the osmotic impact of the [Na<sup>+</sup>]<sub>cyt</sub> increase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Dennis et al., 2018</xref>), a decline in cholesterol extrusion from the parasite plasma membrane as a result of the increase in [Na<sup>+</sup>]<sub>cyt</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Das et al., 2016</xref>), and an intensified rigidity of erythrocytes infected with ring-stage parasites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>). In this study, the CIP-exposed wild-type <italic>B. gibsoni</italic> became swollen, which was identical to a prior study on <italic>P. falciparum</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Dennis et al., 2018</xref>). Interestingly, TEM analysis of parasites incubated with CIP revealed ultrastructural alterations characterized by significant vacuole formation in the cytoplasm, a hallmark of stress or early stages of cell death. These changes were similar to those observed in <italic>B. bovis</italic> treated with clotrimazole and ketoconazole, which ultimately led to growth inhibition or parasite death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bork et al., 2003</xref>). Despite the vacuolization, the structural integrity of the nucleus and membranes was maintained, suggesting a gradual process where vacuolization precedes the complete destruction of the parasite. One explanation is the swelling of the isolated parasites, which can be ascribed to the osmotic consequences of Na<sup>+</sup> uptake and is contingent upon the presence of Na<sup>+</sup> in the external environment.</p>
<p>The output of Na<sup>+</sup> and input of H<sup>+</sup> diminished upon CIP-induced inhibition of <italic>Pf</italic>ATP4, and the continued outflow of H<sup>+</sup> via V-type H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase led to an alkalinization that ultimately killed the parasites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Spillman et al., 2013</xref>). Our capacity to measure a time-dependent increase in the concentration of [Na<sup>+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> and pH value for wild-type <italic>B. gibsoni</italic> facilitated us to gain insight into the basic mechanisms of CIP on <italic>Bg</italic>ATP4<sup>WT</sup> function. Furthermore, our results validate that internal alkalinization was the main factor in <italic>Babesia</italic> death and support our hypothesis that the swollen isolated parasites were produced by Na<sup>+</sup> absorption. To explore further how mutations in <italic>Bg</italic>ATP4 are associated with the upregulation of the parasite’s [Na<sup>+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> and [H<sup>+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>, we tested two <italic>Bg</italic>ATP4-mutant lines that were chosen previously with <italic>Bg</italic>ATP4 inhibitors (<italic>Bg</italic>ATP4<sup>L921V</sup> and <italic>Bg</italic>ATP4<sup>L921I</sup>). Due to the presence of L921V and L921I mutations in drug-resistant strains of <italic>Bg</italic>ATP4, the concentration of Na<sup>+</sup> did not increase as much as it would have in the wild-type strain following the addition of 20 nM CIP for 20 min. As intraerythrocytic alkalinization rises, the same outcome happens. From these results, we deduced how natural mutations in <italic>Bg</italic>ATP4 may affect ATP4 inhibitor susceptibility by dysregulating H<sup>+</sup> and Na<sup>+</sup> balance, which helped parasites survive in a relatively high concentration of CIP. An illustration of the putative processes for regulating Na<sup>+</sup> and H<sup>+</sup> in erythrocytes infected with the <italic>Babesia</italic> parasite is presented in <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figure supplement 4</xref>.</p>
<p>In a previous study’s isolated membrane assay, CIP was found to be more effective at inhibiting parasite development than <italic>Pf</italic>ATP4-associated ATPase activity and reduced sensitivity of <italic>Pf</italic>ATP4-associated ATPase activity to the medication was associated with a decrease in parasite susceptibility to CIP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Rosling et al., 2018</xref>). In our study, the higher resistance to CIP-mediated inhibition of parasite proliferation observed in <italic>Bg</italic>ATP4<sup>L921I</sup> compared to <italic>Bg</italic>ATP4<sup>L921V</sup> correlated with a higher resistance of <italic>Bg</italic>ATP4-associated ATPase activity to the drug. These findings provide additional evidence that the ATPase activity measured in this study corresponds to the activity of the <italic>Bg</italic>ATP4 protein.</p>
<p>According to studies using the <italic>Pf</italic>ATP4 model for molecular docking, the G358S mutation results in a steric clash that lowers CIP’s binding affinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Qiu et al., 2022</xref>). The results from the current study were similar to the <italic>Pf</italic>ATP4 model. The molecular docking was constructed using a ColabFold model of wild-type <italic>Bg</italic>ATP4, which predicted the binding mode and affinity between ATP4 protein and the ligand to provide a possible mechanistic explanation. It suggested that the L921V mutation caused changes at the atomic level, whereas the L921I mutation created a steric clash that reduced the binding affinity of CIP. The predicted affinity score of the L921I mutation was lower than that of the L921V mutation. Thus, it is possible that CIP had a weaker binding to <italic>Bg</italic>ATP4<sup>L921I</sup> than to <italic>Bg</italic>ATP4<sup>L921V</sup>. These findings are consistent with the results obtained from measuring the IC<sub>50</sub> of the drug against parasites with the L921V and L921I mutations.</p>
<p>While CIP shows promise as an antibabesial agent, the emergence of resistance emphasizes the importance of rational drug use and the development of combination therapies. Our results demonstrate that CIP did not exhibit cross-resistance with ATO or TQ, as IC<sub>50</sub> values for ATO and TQ in resistant strains showed minimal changes (&lt;1-fold) compared to the wild-type strain. This observation suggests that CIP could be effectively combined with other anti-babesial drugs to reduce the risk of resistance development. Previous studies have also reported that a single dose of TQ may not be sufficient to prevent parasite relapse in immunocompromised hosts, recommending either repeated TQ administration or combination therapy with other antibabesial agents to address this issue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Liu et al., 2024</xref>). Supporting this approach, our study demonstrates that the combination of CIP plus TQ effectively cleared <italic>B. microti</italic> infections in SCID mice, with no detectable parasitemia or DNA observed at 90 DPI, indicating complete parasite elimination.</p>
<p>This preclinical finding underscores the potential of the CIP plus TQ combination as a viable treatment strategy for babesiosis, especially in cases where monotherapy is ineffective. Further studies are needed to fully explore the pharmacokinetics, long-term efficacy, and potential side effects of such combinations in clinical settings, ultimately facilitating optimized therapeutic strategies.</p>
<p>In summary, our findings provide a comprehensive understanding of CIP’s efficacy, mechanism of resistance, and identifying strategies to enhance its therapeutic potential. The combination of CIP with drugs like TQ offers a promising approach to combat babesiosis and mitigate the development of resistance.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this manuscript, authors have tried to repurpose cipargamin (CIP), a known drug against Plasmodium and Toxoplasma against Babesia. They proved the efficacy of CIP on Babesia in nanomolar range. In silico analyses revealed the drug resistance mechanism through a single amino acid mutation at amino acid position 921 on the ATP4 gene of Babesia. Overall, the conclusions drawn by the authors are well justified by their data. I believe this study opens up a novel therapeutic strategy against babesiosis.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Authors have carried out a comprehensive study. All the experiments performed were carried out methodically and logically.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors aim to establish that cipargamin can be used for the treatment of infection caused by Babesia organisms.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The study provides strong evidence that cipargamin is effective against various Babesia species. In vitro growth assays were used to establish that cipargamin is effective against Babesia bovis and Babesia gibsoni. Infection of mice with Babesia microti demonstrated that cipargamin is as effective as the combination of atovaquone plus azithromycin. Cipargamin protected mice from lethal infection with Babesia rodhaini. Mutations that confer resistance to cipargamin were identified in the gene encoding ATP4, a P-type Na ATPase that is found in other apicomplexan parasites, thereby validating ATP4 as the target of cipargamin. A 7-day treatment of cipagarmin, when combined with a single dose of tafenoquine, was sufficient to eradicate Babesia microti in a mouse model of severe babesiosis caused by lack of adaptive immunity.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Cipargamin was tested in vivo at a single dose administered daily for 7 days. Despite the prospect of using cipargamin for the treatment of human babesiosis, there was no attempt to identify the lowest dose of cipagarmin that protects mice from Babesia microti infection. In the SCID mouse model, cipargamin was tested in combination with tafenoquine but not with atovaquone and/or azithromycin, although the latter combination is often used as first-line therapy for human babesiosis caused by Babesia microti.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this manuscript, the authors address an important issue in <italic>Babesia</italic> research by repurposing cipargamin (CIP) as a potential therapeutic against selective <italic>Babesia</italic> spp. In this study, CIP demonstrated potent <italic>in vitro</italic> inhibition of <italic>B. bovis</italic> and <italic>B. gibsoni</italic> with IC<sub>50</sub> values of 20.2 ± 1.4 nM and 69.4 ± 2.2 nM, respectively, and the <italic>in vivo</italic> efficacy against <italic>Babesia</italic> spp. using mouse model. The authors identified two key resistance mutations in the <italic>Bg</italic>ATP4 gene (<italic>Bg</italic>ATP4<sup>L921I</sup> and <italic>Bg</italic>ATP4<sup>L921V</sup>) and explored their implications through phenotypic characterization of the parasite using cell biological experiments, complemented by <italic>in silico</italic> analysis. Overall, the findings are promising and could significantly advance <italic>Babesia</italic> treatment strategies.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>In this manuscript, the authors effectively repurpose cipargamin (CIP) as a potential treatment for <italic>Babesia</italic> spp. They provide compelling <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> data showing strong efficacy. Key resistance mutations in the <italic>Bg</italic>ATP4 gene are identified and analyzed through both phenotypic and in silico methods, offering valuable insights for advancing treatment strategies.</p>

<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The manuscript explores important aspects of drug repurposing and rational drug design using cipargamin (CIP) against <italic>Babesia</italic>. However, several weaknesses should be addressed. The study lacks novelty as similar research on cipargamin has been conducted, and the experimental design could be improved. The rationale for choosing CIP over other ATP4-targeting compounds is not well-explained. Validation of mutations relies heavily on <italic>in silico</italic> predictions without sufficient experimental support. The Ion Transport Assay has limitations and would benefit from additional assays like Radiolabeled Ion Flux and Electrophysiological Assays. Also, the study lacks appropriate control drugs and detailed functional characterization. Further clarity on mutation percentages, additional safety testing, and exploration of cross-resistance would strengthen the findings.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate your feedback and for giving us the chance to improve our paper. We have specified how we revised the below comments one by one. I hope these address your concerns.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Comment 1: It is commendable to explore drug repurposing, drug deprescribing, drug repositioning, and rational drug design, especially using established ATP4 inhibitors that are well-studied in <italic>Plasmodium</italic> and other protozoan parasites. While the study provides some interesting findings, it appears to lack novelty, as similar investigations of cipargamin on other protozoan parasites have been conducted. The study does not introduce new concepts, and the experimental design could benefit from refinement to strengthen the results. Additionally, the rationale for choosing CIP over other MMV compounds targeting ATP4 is not clearly articulated. Clarifying the specific advantages CIP may offer against <italic>Babesia</italic> would be beneficial. Finally, the validation of the identified mutations might be strengthened by additional experimental support, as reliance on <italic>in silico</italic> predictions alone may not fully address the functional impact, particularly given the potential ambiguity of the mutations (<italic>Bg</italic>ATP4 L to V and I).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your thoughtful feedback. We have addressed the concerns as follows: (1) Introduction of new concepts and experimental design: While our study primarily builds on existing frameworks, it provides novel insights into the interaction of CIP with <italic>Babesia</italic> parasites, which we believe contribute to the field. Regarding the experimental design, we acknowledge its limitations and have revised the manuscript to include additional experiments to strengthen the robustness of our findings. Specifically, we have added experiments on the detection of <italic>Bg</italic>ATP4-associated ATPase activity (Figure 3H), the evaluation of cross-resistance to antibabesial agents (Figures 5A and 5B), and the efficacy of CIP plus TQ combination in eliminating <italic>B. microti</italic> infection with no recrudescence in SCID mice (Figure 5C).</p>
<p>(2) Rationale for choosing CIP over other MMV compounds targeting ATP4: We appreciate this point and have expanded the introduction section to articulate our rationale for selecting CIP (Lines 94-97). Specifically, CIP was chosen due to its previously demonstrated efficacy against <italic>Plasmodium</italic> and other protozoan parasites.</p>
<p>(3) Validation of identified mutations: We agree that additional experimental data would strengthen the validation of the identified mutations. In response, we have indicated the ratio of wild-type to mutant parasites by Illumina NovaSeq6000 to validate the impact of the <italic>Bg</italic>ATP4 C-to-G and A mutations (Figure 2D).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Comment 2: Conducting an Ion Transport Assay is useful but has limitations. Non-specific binding or transport by other cellular components can lead to inaccurate results, causing false positives or negatives and making data interpretation difficult. Indirect measurements, like changes in fluorescence or electrical potential, can introduce artifacts. To improve accuracy, consider additional assays such as</p>
<p>a. Radiolabeled Ion Flux Assay: tracks the movement of Na<sup>+</sup> using radiolabeled ions, providing direct evidence of ion transport.</p>
<p>b. Electrophysiological Assay: measures ionic currents in real-time with patch-clamp techniques, offering detailed information about ATP4 activity.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for highlighting the limitations of the ion transport assay and suggesting alternative approaches to improve accuracy. However, they require specialized equipment and expertise not currently available in our laboratory. We have acknowledged these limitations and included these alternative methods as part of the study's future directions. Thank you for your suggestions which will undoubtedly enhance the rigor and depth of our research.</p>
<p>Comment 3: <italic>In-silico</italic> predictions can provide plausible outcomes, but it is essential to evaluate how the recombinant purified protein and ligand interact and function at physiological levels. This aspect is currently missing and should be included. For example, incorporating immunoprecipitation and ATPase activity assays with both wild-type and mutant proteins, as well as detailed kinetic studies with Cipargamin, would be recommended to validate the findings of the study.</p>
<p>Thank you for your insightful suggestions regarding the validation of <italic>in-silico</italic> predictions. We recognize the importance of evaluating the interaction and function of recombinant purified proteins and ligands at physiological levels to strengthen the study's findings. (1) Incorporating experimental validation:</p>
<p>a. Immunoprecipitation assays: We agree that immunoprecipitation could provide valuable evidence of protein-ligand interactions. While this was not included in the current study due to limitations in sample availability, we plan to incorporate this assay in follow-up experiments.</p>
<p>b. ATPase activity assays: Assessing ATPase activity in both wild-type and mutant proteins is a crucial step in validating the functional impact of the identified mutations. We included the results in the revised manuscript (Figure 3H).</p>
<p>(2) Detailed kinetic studies with cipargamin: We appreciate the recommendation to conduct detailed kinetic analyses. These studies would provide deeper insights into the binding affinity and inhibition dynamics of cipargamin. We have included the results of these experiments in the current study (Figure 3I).</p>
<p>Comment 4: The study lacks specific suitable control drugs tested both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. For accurate drug assessment, especially when evaluating drugs based on a specific phenotype, such as enlarged parasites, it is important to use ATP4 gene-specific inhibitors. Including similar classes of drugs, such as Aminopyrazoles, Dihydroisoquinolines, Pyrazoleamides, Pantothenamides, Imidazolopiperazines (e.g., GNF179), and Bicyclic Azetidine Compounds, would provide more comprehensive validation.</p>
<p>Thank you for emphasizing the importance of including suitable control drugs. We acknowledge the absence of specific control drugs in the previous version of the manuscript. To date, no drug targeting ATP4 proteins in <italic>Babesia</italic> has been definitively identified. The suggested drugs could potentially disrupt the parasite's ability to regulate sodium levels by inhibiting <italic>Pf</italic>ATP4, a protein essential for its survival. This highlights <italic>Pf</italic>ATP4 as an attractive target for antimalarial drug development. However, further studies are required to evaluate whether these drugs exhibit similar activity against ATP4 homologs in <italic>Babesia</italic>.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Comment 5: Functional characterization of CIP through microscopic examination and quantification for assessing parasite size enlargement is not entirely reliable. A Flow Cytometry-Based Assay is recommended instead 9 along with suitable control antiparasitic drugs). To effectively monitor Cipargamin's action, conducting time-course experiments with 6-hour intervals is advisable rather than relying solely on endpoint measurements. Additionally, for accurate assessment of parasite morphology, obtaining representative qualitative images using Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) or Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) for treated versus untreated samples is recommended for precise measurements.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your constructive feedback regarding the methods for functional characterization of CIP and the evaluation of parasite morphology.</p>
<p>(1) Flow Cytometry-Based Assay: We agree that a flow cytometry-based assay would enhance the accuracy of detecting changes in parasite size and morphology. We will implement this method in future studies as our laboratory currently does not have the capability to conduct such experiments.</p>
<p>(2) Microscopy for Morphology Assessment: We acknowledge the importance of obtaining high-resolution, representative images of treated and untreated samples. Utilizing Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) or Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) for qualitative analysis will significantly improve the precision of our morphological assessments. However, both methods have limitations.</p>
<p>a. SEM: This technique can only scan the erythrocytes' surface; it cannot scan the parasite itself because it is inside the erythrocytes.</p>
<p>b. TEM: Since the parasite is fixed, observations from various angles may reveal longitudinal or cross-sectional portions, making it impossible to precisely view the parasite's dimensions. As a result, we employed TEM to precisely observe the parasite's internal structure alterations both before and after treatment, as seen in Figure 3C.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Comment 6: A notable contradiction observed is that mutant cells displayed reduced efficacy and affinity but more pronounced phenotypic effects. The <italic>Bg</italic>ATP4<sup>L921I</sup> mutation shows a 2x lower susceptibility (IC<sub>50</sub> of 887.9 ± 61.97 nM) and a predicted binding affinity of -6.26 kcal/mol with CIP. However, the phenotype exhibits significantly lower Na<sup>+</sup> concentration in <italic>Bg</italic>ATP4<sup>L921I</sup> (P = 0.0087) (Figure 3E).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The seemingly contradicting observation of reduced CIP binding and efficacy in the <italic>Bg</italic>ATP4<sup>L921I</sup> mutant with a significant decrease in intracellular Na<sup>+</sup> concentration may be explained by factors other than the direct CIP interaction. Logically, we consider that CIP binds less effectively to its target in the <italic>Bg</italic>ATP4<sup>L921I</sup> mutant, but the observed phenotype may be attributed to the functional consequences of the mutation. The <italic>Bg</italic>ATP4<sup>L921I</sup> mutation probably directly impacts the function of <italic>Bg</italic>ATP4's ion transport mechanism, which likely disrupts Na<sup>+</sup> homeostasis independently. Thus, we hypothesize that the dysregulated Na<sup>+</sup> homeostasis is driven by the mutation itself rather than the already weakened inhibitory effect of CIP.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Comment 7: The manuscript does not clarify the percentage of mutations, and the number of sequence iterations performed on the ATP4 gene. It is also unclear whether clonal selection was carried out on the resistant population. If mutations are not present in 100% of the resistant parasites, please indicate the ratio of wild-type to mutant parasites and represent this information in the figure, along with the chromatograms.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your valuable comments. We appreciate your detailed observations and giving us the opportunity to clarify these points. During the long-term culture process, subculturing was performed every three days. Although clonal selection was not conducted, mutant strains were effectively selected during this process. Using the Illumina NovaSeq6000 sequencing platform, high-throughput next-generation sequencing was performed to detect ratio of wild-type to mutant parasites. Results showed that for <italic>Bg</italic>ATP4<sup>L921V</sup>, 99.97% of 7,960 reads were G, and for <italic>Bg</italic>ATP4<sup>L921I</sup>, 99.92% of 7,862 reads were A. To enhance clarity, we have included a new figure (Figure 2D) illustrating the sequencing results. We believe this addition will help provide a clearer understanding for the readers.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Comment 8: While the compound's toxicity data is well-established, it is advisable to include additional testing in epithelial cells and liver-specific cell lines (e.g., HeLa, HCT, HepG2) if feasible for the authors. This would provide a more comprehensive assessment of the compound's safety profile.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your thoughtful suggestion. We included toxicity testing in human foreskin fibroblasts (HFF) as supplemental toxicity data to provide a more comprehensive evaluation of the compound's safety profile (Figure supplement 1B).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Comment 9: In the <italic>in vivo</italic> efficacy study, recrudescent parasites emerged after 8 days of treatment. Did these parasites harbor the same mutation in the ATP4 gene? The authors did not investigate this aspect, which is crucial for understanding the basis of recrudescence.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for raising this important point. We acknowledge that understanding the genetic basis of recrudescence is critical for elucidating mechanisms of resistance and treatment failure. Although our current study did not include an analysis of the <italic>Br</italic>ATP4 gene in relapse parasites due to limitations in sample availability, we evaluated CIP efficacy in SCID mice and performed sequencing analysis of the <italic>Bm</italic>ATP4 gene in recrudescent samples. However, no mutation points were identified (Lines 211-212). We believe that if a relapse occurs after the 7-day treatment, it is unlikely that the parasites would easily acquire mutations.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Comment 10: The authors should explain their choice of BABL/c mice for evaluating CIP efficacy, as these mice clear the infection and may not fully represent the compound's effectiveness. Investigating CIP efficacy in SCID mice would be valuable, as they provide a more reliable model and eliminate the influence of the immune system. The rationale for not using SCID mice should be clarified.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the reviewer's suggestion regarding the use of SCID mice to evaluate the efficacy of CIP. In response to your suggestion, we have now included an experiment using SCID mice to evaluate the efficacy of CIP and to eliminate the confounding influence of the immune system. We further investigated the potential of combined administration of CIP plus TQ to eliminate parasites, as we are concerned that the long-term use of CIP as a monotherapy may be limited due to its potential for developing resistance. The results are shown in Figure 5C.</p>
<p>Comment 11: Do the <italic>in vitro</italic>-resistant parasites show any potential for cross-resistance with commonly used antiparasitic drugs? Have the authors considered this possibility, and what are their expectations regarding cross-resistance?</p>
<p>Thank you for your insightful question regarding the potential for cross-resistance between <italic>in vitro</italic>-resistant parasites and commonly used antiparasitic drugs. In response to your suggestion, we have now included experiments to assess whether <italic>B. gibsoni</italic> parasites that are resistant to CIP exhibit any cross-resistance to other commonly used antiparasitic drugs, such as atovaquone (ATO) and tafenoquine (TQ). The IC<sub>50</sub> values for both ATO and TQ in the resistant strains showed only slight changes compared to the wild-type strain, with less than a onefold difference (Figure 5A, 5B). This minimal variation suggests that the resistant strain has a mild alteration in susceptibility to ATO and TQ, but not enough to indicate strong resistance or significant cross-resistance. This suggests that CIP could be used in combination with TQ to treat babesiosis.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this manuscript, the authors have tried to repurpose cipargamin (CIP), a known drug against <italic>plasmodium</italic> and <italic>toxoplasma</italic> against <italic>babesia</italic>. They proved the efficacy of CIP on <italic>babesia</italic> in the nanomolar range. <italic>In silico</italic> analyses revealed the drug resistance mechanism through a single amino acid mutation at amino acid position 921 on the ATP4 gene of <italic>Babesia</italic>. Overall, the conclusions drawn by the authors are well justified by their data. I believe this study opens up a novel therapeutic strategy against babesiosis.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors have carried out a comprehensive study. All the experiments performed were carried out methodically and logically.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for the comments and your time to review our manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The introduction section needs to be more informative. The authors are investigating the binding of CIP to the ATP4 gene, but they did not give any information about the gene or how the ATP4 inhibitors work in general. The resolution of the figures is not good and the font size is too small to read properly. I also have several minor concerns which have been addressed in the &quot;Recommendations for the authors&quot; section.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for their valuable comments. In response, we have revised the introduction to include a more detailed explanation of the ATP4 gene, its biological significance, and the mechanism of ATP4 inhibitors to provide a better context of the study (Lines 86-93). Additionally, we have reformatted the figures to enhance resolution and increased the font size to ensure improved readability. We also appreciate the reviewer's careful assessment of the manuscript and have addressed all minor concerns outlined in the &quot;Recommendations for the Authors&quot; section. A detailed, point-by-point response to each concern is provided in the response letter, and the corresponding revisions have been incorporated into the manuscript.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors aim to establish that cipargamin can be used for the treatment of infection caused by <italic>Babesia</italic> organisms.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The study provides strong evidence that cipargamin is effective against various <italic>Babesia</italic> species. <italic>In vitro</italic>, growth assays were used to establish that cipargamin is effective against <italic>Babesia bovis</italic> and <italic>Babesia gibsoni</italic>. Infection of mice with <italic>Babesia microti</italic> demonstrated that cipargamin is as effective as the combination of atovaquone plus azithromycin. Cipargamin protected mice from lethal infection with <italic>Babesia rodhaini</italic>. Mutations that confer resistance to cipargamin were identified in the gene encoding ATP4, a P-type Na<sup>+</sup> ATPase that was found in other apicomplexan parasites, thereby validating ATP4 as the target of cipargamin.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the reviewer for taking the time to review our manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Cipargamin was tested <italic>in vivo</italic> at a single dose administered daily for 7 days. Despite the prospect of using cipargamin for the treatment of human babesiosis, there was no attempt to identify the lowest dose of cipagarmin that protects mice from <italic>Babesia microti</italic> infection. Exposure to cipargamin can induce resistance, indicating that cipargamin should not be used alone but in combination with other drugs. There was no attempt at testing cipargamin in combination with other drugs, particularly atovaquone, in the mouse model of <italic>Babesia microti</italic> infection. Given the difficulty in treating immunocompromised patients infected with <italic>Babesia microti</italic>, it would have been informative to test cipargamin in a mouse model of severe immunosuppression (SCID or rag-deficient mice).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for raising these important comments. We address each concern as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Identifying the lowest protective dose of CIP:</p>
<p>Although our current study was designed to assess the efficacy of CIP at a single therapeutic dose over a 7-day period, we acknowledge that identifying the lowest effective dose would provide valuable information for optimizing treatment regimens. We plan to address this in future studies by conducting a dose-response experiment to identify the minimal protective dose of CIP.</p>
<p>(2) Testing CIP in combination with other drugs:</p>
<p>In the current study, we have tested the efficacy of tafenoquine (TQ) combined with CIP, as well as CIP or TQ administered individually, in a mouse model of <italic>B. microti</italic> infection. Our results demonstrated that, compared with monotherapy, the combination of CIP and TQ completely eliminated the parasites within 90 days of observation (Figure 5C).</p>
<p>(3) Testing in an immunocompromised mouse model:</p>
<p>We agree with the reviewer that evaluating CIP in immunocompromised models is critical for understanding its potential in treating immunocompromised patients. To address this, we have conducted experiments using SCID mice infected with <italic>B. microti</italic>. Our results indicated that the combination therapy of CIP plus TQ was effective in eliminating parasites in the severely immunocompromised model (Figure 5D).</p>

<p>Comment 2: Did the authors investigate the potential of combination therapies involving CIP?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have tested the efficacy of TQ combined with CIP in a mouse model of <italic>B. microti</italic> infection.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Comment 3: Does this mutation affect the transmission of the parasite?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Based on our observations, the growth and generation rates of the mutant strain are comparable to those of the wild-type strain. These findings suggest that the mutation does not significantly affect the spread or transmission of the parasite. We have included this observation in the revised manuscript (Lines 243-244).</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p>
<p>Comment 1: In the last paragraph of the introduction, the authors mentioned determining the activity of CIP <italic>in vitro</italic> in <italic>B. bovis</italic> and <italic>B. gibsoni</italic> while <italic>in vivo</italic> in <italic>B. microti</italic> and <italic>B. rodhaini</italic>. It is not explained why they are testing the <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> effects on different <italic>Babesia</italic> species. Could you please add some logic there? Also, why did they mention measuring the inhibitory activity of CIP by monitoring the Na<sup>+</sup> and H<sup>+</sup> balance? This part needs to be rewritten with more information. The ATP4 gene is not properly introduced in the manuscript.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for raising these important points. Below, we address each aspect of the comment in detail:</p>
<p>(1) Rationale for testing different <italic>Babesia</italic> spp. <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>:</p>
<p><italic>B. bovis</italic> and <italic>B. gibsoni</italic> are well-established <italic>Babesia</italic> models for <italic>in vitro</italic> culture systems, allowing evaluation of CIP's inhibitory activity under controlled laboratory conditions. <italic>B. microti</italic> and <italic>B. rodhaini</italic>, on the other hand, are commonly used rodent models for the <italic>in vivo</italic> studies of babesiosis, enabling the assessment of drug efficacy in a mammalian host system. This multi-species approach provides a comprehensive evaluation of CIP's efficacy across <italic>Babesia</italic> spp. with different biological characteristics.</p>
<p>(2) Measuring CIP's inhibitory activity via Na<sup>+</sup> and H<sup>+</sup> balance:</p>
<p>We acknowledge that this section of the introduction requires more context. The revised manuscript now includes additional information explaining that the ATP4 gene, which encodes a Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> transporter, is the proposed target of CIP (Lines 86-93). CIP disrupts the ion homeostasis maintained by ATP4, leading to an imbalance in Na<sup>+</sup> and H<sup>+</sup> concentrations. Monitoring these ionic changes provides a mechanistic understanding of CIP's mode of action and its impact on parasite viability. This rationale has been expanded in the introduction to clarify its significance.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Comment 2: The figure fonts are too small. The resolution for the images is also poor.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have increased the font size in all figures to improve readability. Additionally, we have replaced the figures with high-resolution versions to ensure clarity and visual quality.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Comment 3: Figures 1A and 1B: one of the error bars merged to the X-axis legend. Please modify these panels. Which curve was used to determine the IC<sub>50</sub> values (although it's mentioned in the methods section, would it be better to have the information in the figure legends as well)?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for their comments regarding Figures 1A and 1B.</p>
<p>(1) Error bars overlapping the X-axis legend:</p>
<p>The error bars in the figures were automatically generated using GraphPad Prism9 based on the data and are determined by the values themselves. Unfortunately, this overlap cannot be avoided without altering the data representation.</p>
<p>(2) IC<sub>50</sub> curve information:</p>

<p>Comment 4: Supplementary Figure 1: what are MDCK cells? What is CC<sub>50</sub>?

</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out the need to clarify terms and provide additional context in the supplementary figure and text. We have updated the figure legend and text to include the full forms of MDCK (Madin-Darby canine kidney) cells and CC<sub>50</sub> (50% cytotoxic concentration), ensuring clarity for readers encountering these terms for the first time. In text, now we have included a brief explanation of the selectivity index as a measure of a drug's safety and specificity (Lines 108-110). The selectivity index is calculated as the ratio between the half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC<sub>50</sub>) and the 50% cytotoxic concentration (CC<sub>50</sub>) values (Lines 333-335). We also have already included gray dashed lines in the graphs to indicate where the IC<sub>50</sub> values were derived from the curves (Figure supplement 1).</p>

<p>We appreciate the reviewer's suggestion regarding the notation of &quot;n=6&quot; in Figures 1C-F. To improve clarity and reduce redundancy, we have removed the &quot;n=6&quot; notation from the individual panels and included it in the figure legend instead.</p>

<p>Comment 7: Figure 2D: some of the error bars merged to the X-axis legend. Please modify. Again, which curve was used to determine the IC<sub>50</sub> values? Can the authors explain why the pH declined after 4 minutes?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for this insightful question.</p>
<p>(1) Error bars overlapping the X-axis legend:</p>
<p>The error bars in Figure 2E were automatically generated using GraphPad Prism9 and are determined by the underlying data values. Unfortunately, this overlap cannot be avoided without altering the data representation.</p>
<p>(2) IC<sub>50</sub> curve information:</p>
<p>Since Figure 2E contains three separate curves, adding dashed lines to indicate the IC<sub>50</sub> for each curve would make the figure overly cluttered and reduce readability. To address this, we have clearly indicated the IC<sub>50</sub> values in Figures 1A and 1B and described the methodology for determining IC<sub>50</sub> values in the Methods section. We believe this approach provides sufficient clarity without compromising the visual experience of Figure 2E.</p>
<p>(3) The pH decline observed after 4 minutes (Figure 3E) may be attributed to the following factors:</p>
<p>a. Ion transport dynamics:</p>
<p>The initial rise in pH likely reflects the rapid inhibition of Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> exchange mediated by CIP, which temporarily alkalinizes the intracellular environment. However, after this initial phase, compensatory mechanisms, such as proton influx or metabolic acid production, may lead to a subsequent decline in pH.</p>
<p>b. Drug kinetics and target interaction:</p>
<p>The decline could also result from the time-dependent effects of CIP on ATP4-mediated ion transport. As the drug action stabilizes, the parasite may partially restore ionic balance, leading to a decrease in intracellular pH.</p>

<p>Comment 6: Lines 184-185: given that exposure to CIP induces mutations in the ATP4 gene and therefore resistance to CIP, what is the prospect of using CIP for the treatment of babesiosis?

</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for raising this important question. Given that exposure to CIP induces mutations in the ATP4 gene, leading to resistance, we acknowledge that the long-term use of CIP as a monotherapy may be limited due to the potential for resistance development. To address this concern, we investigated the combination therapy of TQ and CIP to achieve the complete elimination of <italic>B. microti</italic> in infected mice (a model for human babesiosis).
