<abstract><p>Naïve B cells exit quiescence and enter a proliferative state upon activation, ultimately differentiating into antibody-secreting or memory B cells. Toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands, such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS), can serve as physiological stimuli to initiate this transition. Using quantitative proteomics, we show that TLR4 engagement induces metabolic reprogramming in murine B cells, increasing the expression of amino acid transporters and cholesterol biosynthetic enzymes. The amino acid transporter SLC7A5 is markedly upregulated following LPS stimulation, and conditional deletion of <italic>Slc7a5</italic> impairs B cell proliferation, underscoring its essential role in B cell activation. LPS also elevates intracellular cholesterol levels, and inhibition of the rate-limiting enzyme HMG-CoA reductase blocks proliferation. This effect was mediated by a dual requirement for cholesterol metabolism and protein prenylation downstream of HMG-CoA reductase. Notably, this was not unique to TLR4 signalling but is also observed in B cells activated via TLR7, TLR9, CD40, or the B cell receptor. Together, these findings reveal that metabolic rewiring, including amino acid uptake and cholesterol metabolism, is an essential feature of B cell activation and proliferation.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>B cell activation can be initiated through either T cell-dependent (TD) or T cell-independent (TI) pathways, with TI activation further subdivided into a type I or type II response depending on the stimuli. During TD activation, following recognition of a protein antigen via the B cell receptor (BCR), the B cell can present peptides from the antigen to CD4 T cells, resulting in T cell activation. Additionally, the B cell receives co-stimulation through the binding of its CD40 receptor to the CD40 ligand found on T cells, which promotes differentiation, proliferation, somatic hypermutation, and class switch recombination (CSR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Hoffman et al, 2016</xref>). Type I TI responses are activated by agonists such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS), which bind to toll-like receptors (TLRs) on B cells to induce a strong proliferative signal and increase antibody production. Longer-term exposure to LPS can also promote the differentiation of plasma cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Genestier et al, 2007</xref>). Conversely, type II TI antigens consist of long repetitive structures, such as polysaccharides, which at high concentrations crosslink multiple BCRs to stimulate proliferation and antibody production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Obukhanych &amp; Nussenzweig, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>A well-established model to study TI B cell activation is to use LPS, a component of the cell wall of gram-negative bacteria, which stimulates TLR4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Hoshino et al, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Poltorak et al, 1998</xref>) to induce robust B cell proliferation and antibody secretion, both <italic>ex vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Coutinho et al, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Dziarski, 1982</xref>) and <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Johnson et al, 1956</xref>). Upon activation, TLR4 propagates downstream signalling through the adaptor proteins MyD88 and TRIF. This in turn activates pathways, including MAPK and NF-κB signalling, to elicit the required physiological response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Arthur &amp; Ley, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Kawai et al, 2024</xref>). The essential role of TLR4 in LPS-induced activation of B cells has been demonstrated by studies using TLR4-deficient mice. B cells from TLR4 or Myd88 knockout mice did not proliferate in response to LPS or lipid A stimulation <italic>ex vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Hoshino et al, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Kawai et al, 1999</xref>). Similarly, in studies where B cells from MyD88- and TLR4-knockout mice were transferred into µMT mice (that lack mature B cells), a significant reduction in IgG1 production was observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Pasare &amp; Medzhitov, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Naïve B cells have been shown to be in a quiescent state with low metabolic demand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Waters et al, 2018</xref>). Conversely, B cell activation must require a significant increase in biomolecules such as proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids to support their rapid expansion and proliferation. The existing literature has focused on the role of glucose and glucose transporters in B cell function. Previous studies have demonstrated that activation using LPS or anti-IgM to stimulate the BCR increases glucose uptake and leads to an increased oxygen consumption rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Dufort et al, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Jellusova et al, 2017</xref>). Whether this corresponds to changes in metabolic enzymes at a proteomic level, and whether TI B cell activation utilises other metabolic pathways, remains unknown. This increased glucose uptake has been shown to provide precursors for ribonucleotide and lipid synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Waters et al, 2018</xref>). Similarly, the deletion of <italic>Slc2a1</italic> (which encodes for glucose transporter GLUT1) impaired germinal centre formation, plasma cell differentiation, and the production of high-affinity antibodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Bierling et al, 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Brookens et al, 2023</xref>). Recent reviews have expressed the need for studies investigating metabolic changes in activated B cells, especially the role of lipid metabolism, which is poorly understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Johnstone et al, 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Peeters &amp; Jellusova, 2023</xref>).</p>
<p>T cell activation has been shown to stimulate global changes in metabolism at a proteomic level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Procaccini et al, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Howden et al, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Tan et al, 2017</xref>). However, there are no comparable proteomic studies that demonstrate how B cells support the change in metabolic requirements and energy demand from quiescence to activation upon LPS stimulation. Therefore, we used Data Independent Acquisition (DIA) based mass spectrometry to profile the B cell response to a combination of LPS + Interleukin 4 (IL-4) stimulation, a well-established <italic>ex vivo</italic> model of TI B cell activation. From this, we identified a substantial upregulation of proteins involved in multiple metabolic pathways, including amino acid uptake and cholesterol biosynthesis. We demonstrate the requirement of L-amino acid transporter SLC7A5 for B cell survival and proliferation <italic>ex vivo</italic>. Similarly, we highlight the necessity of both cholesterol metabolism and protein prenylation downstream of the rate-limiting enzyme HMG-CoA reductase for B cell growth, survival, and proliferation. These results highlight the pronounced metabolic rewiring induced downstream of LPS + IL-4 stimulation.</p>

<title>LPS + IL-4 stimulation of murine B cells promotes proliferation and changes the expression of enzymes involved in cellular metabolism</title>
<p>Previous studies have shown that <italic>ex vivo</italic> stimulation of murine B cells with LPS and IL-4 can drive B cell proliferation and class switching to IgG1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Snapper et al, 1988</xref>). Consistent with this, we found that lymphocytes isolated from lymph nodes and subsequently stimulated with LPS + IL-4 resulted in the proliferation of CD19+ B cells, as judged by dilution of Cell Trace Violet (CTV) labelling. LPS + IL-4 stimulation led to extensive proliferation, with up to 6 generations of B cells present after 72 hours (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). Proliferation itself is thought to be a prerequisite for cells to undergo class-switching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Hodgkin et al, 1996</xref>). In line with this, only LPS + IL-4 stimulated B cells found in later generations were positive for IgG1 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). On a similar note, cell size is considered a key regulator of the G1/S transition, as progression through the cell cycle can only continue once a certain threshold in size has been reached (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Barberis et al, 2007</xref>). Accordingly, we found that 72 hours of LPS + IL-4 stimulation led to a marked increase in cell size and granularity as indicated by a higher forward/side scatter compared to naïve B cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B-D</xref>). Stimulation with IL-4 alone resulted in a smaller increase in cell size than a combination of LPS + IL-4, but did not give rise to a strong proliferative response or class switching (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A-D</xref>). Naïve B cells were used for comparison in ongoing experiments, as surviving unstimulated B cells exhibited a similar phenotype in the flow cytometry analysis; however, the lack of stimulation led to significant cell death from 24 hours onwards (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A-D</xref>, S1A-B).</p>

<p>These functional differences following activation suggest a significant change may be occurring at the protein level. To investigate this further, we analysed changes in the proteome after 24 hours of stimulation, as this time point was sufficient for B cells to increase in size but retain their synchrony in terms of the number of divisions they had undergone <italic>ex vivo</italic>. DIA-based mass spectrometry was used to determine proteomes of naive B cells to activated B cells after 24 hours of LPS + IL-4 stimulation. The proteomic ruler method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Wiśniewski et al, 2014</xref>) was then used to estimate protein copy numbers and concentration. Using this approach, a total of 8030 protein species were identified, of which 7187 were quantified in both naïve and LPS + IL-4 stimulated B cells. Based on the mass spectrometry data, the predicted total protein mass in the B cells increased by approximately 2-fold following stimulation with a combination of LPS + IL-4 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>). This change in protein mass was due to an increased copy number of most proteins in the cell (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>), with a median log<sub>2</sub> fold increase of 1.04. To adjust for the increase in cell size, the fold change in protein concentration was analysed, as this provides an indication of what proteins are selectively upregulated or downregulated as opposed to those that scale with cell size.</p>
<p>For the data using estimated cellular concentrations, using cutoffs of <italic>q</italic> &lt; 0.05 and a log2 fold change more than one standard deviation away from the median, 863 proteins were found to be upregulated following activation, while a further 301 were detected in all of the stimulated B cells but none of the naïve ones. 409 proteins were downregulated in the LPS + IL-4 stimulated B cells in comparison to naïve B cells, while a further 57 were detected in the naïve B cells, but none of the activated B cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G</xref>).</p>
<p>To identify the biological pathways that were affected by LPS + IL-4 stimulation, proteins that were classified as regulated using the criteria above were searched against Gene Ontology (GO) Biological Processes terms and <italic>Kyoto Encyclopaedia of Genes and Genomes</italic> (KEGG) databases. Enrichment analysis on the downregulated proteins did not highlight any specific processes. However, upregulated proteins were associated with terms related to the cell cycle, ribosome biogenesis, protein translation, and steroid biosynthesis (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1H</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="tbls1">Table S1</xref>).</p>
<p>While changes in the above processes would make sense in terms of cell proliferation, it was notable that changes in the glycolytic and oxidative phosphorylation pathways were not highlighted in this analysis. Previous studies have indicated that there is an increased demand for glucose in LPS-activated B cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Dufort et al, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Johnstone et al, 2024</xref>). Isotope tracing experiments following CD40L and IL-4 activation to stimulate proliferation have suggested that this increased glucose uptake is used in the pentose phosphate pathway, potentially to provide NADPH and precursors for nucleotide biosynthesis, while alternative carbon sources may be used to drive an increase in the TCA cycle and oxidative phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Waters et al, 2018</xref>). The levels of enzymes involved in glucose metabolism were therefore examined in the proteomic data. In general, changes in the estimated concentrations of proteins involved in glycolysis, pentose phosphate pathway, TCA cycle, or oxidative phosphorylation were not observed (Figure S2A, B), although their copy numbers did increase in proportion to the increase in cell size (Figure S2C, D). B cells express the SLC2A1 (Glut1) glucose transporter, and deletion of this gene has been shown to reduce B cell activation <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Bierling et al, 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Brookens et al, 2023</xref>). There was an increase in the concentration of SLC2A1, which would be consistent with an elevated ability to take up glucose (Figure S2E). In addition, there was a 13-fold increase in hexokinase 2 (HK2), one of the enzymes involved in catalysing the 1st committed step for glucose to enter the glycolytic or pentose phosphate pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Tanner et al, 2018</xref>) (Figure S2F) and has recently been shown to be required for maximal B cell responses to <italic>ex vivo</italic> stimulation with LPS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Paradoski et al, 2024</xref>). To investigate if the increased copy number of Electron Transport Chain proteins correlated with changes in mitochondrial volume, B cells were stained with MitoTracker Red, a fluorescent dye that binds to mitochondria. We found that MitoTracker staining was significantly increased following 24 hours of LPS + IL-4 stimulation (Figure S2G, H).</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<title>LPS + IL-4 stimulation upregulates proteins involved in the cell cycle</title>
<p>Stimulation with LPS + IL-4 causes B cells to exit from a quiescent state and start to proliferate (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). This was confirmed using DAPI staining, which demonstrated that while naïve B cells were predominantly in a G0/1 state, after 24 hours of LPS + IL-4 stimulation, the proportion of B cells in the S and G2 stages of the cell cycle were increased (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>, B). Progression through G1 is associated with an increase in Cyclin D expression, and activation of CDK4 and 6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Rubin et al, 2020</xref>). At the same time, inhibitory cell cycle proteins such as p27Kip1 (Cdkn1b) are downregulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Wagner et al, 1998</xref>). Therefore, we analysed the proteomic data for evidence of these changes. In naïve B cells, Cyclin D was not detected, while levels of CDK4 and 6 were low. The levels of Cyclin D, CDK4, and CDK6 were all increased following stimulation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C-E</xref>). Naïve B cells also expressed high levels of p27Kip1, and this was reduced by LPS + IL-4 stimulation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>).</p>

<p>Unphosphorylated RB1 binds to the E2F1/2/3 transcription factor, preventing the transcription of genes required for cell cycle progression.

<title>Protein synthesis in LPS + IL-4 stimulated B cells is dependent on the uptake of amino acids</title>
<p>The cell growth and proliferation promoted by LPS + IL-4 stimulation would be expected to require an increased rate of protein synthesis. This is consistent with the proteomic analysis, which demonstrated an increase in total protein content within activated B cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>) and an enrichment of proteins associated with protein translation, including proteins that regulate ribosome biogenesis and the ribosomes themselves (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1H</xref>). The ribosome is composed of 40S and 60S subunits, each of which is composed of multiple proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Doudna &amp; Rath, 2002</xref>). LPS + IL-4 stimulation increased the total concentration of ribosomal proteins that make up both the 40S and 60S subunits (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>, B). This overall increase was due to higher expression of most of the individual proteins that make up the subunits, rather than a large increase in one or two of the proteins (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>, D). In line with the increase in ribosomal proteins, there was also an upregulation of proteins associated with ribosome biogenesis (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E-G</xref>). To determine if this correlated with an increased rate of protein synthesis, we measured the incorporation of the puromycin analogue o-propargyl-puromycin (OPP) into newly synthesised proteins. Consistent with the upregulation of ribosomal proteins, OPP incorporation was significantly higher in B cells stimulated with LPS + IL-4 for 24 hours compared to naive B cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3H-I</xref>).</p>

<p>Elevated protein synthesis during rapid proliferation would require an increased supply of amino acids. B cells have also been reported to increase amino acid biosynthesis upon stimulation. ssRNAseq has shown that cycling B cells express higher levels of mRNA for enzymes in the serine biosynthetic pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">D’Avola et al, 2022</xref>). Furthermore, the level of these proteins, as well as rates of serine biosynthesis, were found to be increased by stimuli such as anti-IgM, CD40L, and CpG, which are known to induce B cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">D’Avola et al, 2022</xref>). While this was not further addressed in the current study, the proteomic data reported here did show that serine biosynthetic enzymes, including the rate-limiting enzyme PHDGH, were increased in response to LPS + IL-4 stimulation (Figure S3).</p>
<p>Increased synthesis alone cannot satisfy the increased need for amino acids in proliferating cells, as the cell is unable to make essential amino acids. Several plasma membrane amino acid transporters were detected in the proteomic analysis, and these were all found to be upregulated in response to stimulation with LPS + IL-4 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). To look at the requirement for increased amino acid uptake during B cell proliferation more closely, we focused on Lat1, a member of the System L transporters. Lat1 is a heterodimer composed of an amino acid transporting light chain subunit, SLC7A5, and a chaperone heavy chain subunit, SLC3A2 (CD98) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Napolitano et al, 2015</xref>). Both of these subunits were upregulated in the proteomic data following LPS + IL-4 stimulation (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>, C).

To examine how the loss of SLC7A5 affects B cell proliferation in response to LPS + IL-4 stimulation, B cells were purified from WT and <italic>Slc7a5</italic> fl/fl/Vav-iCre+/- mice, labelled with CTV, and stimulated for 72 hours with LPS + IL-4 <italic>ex vivo</italic>. The percentage of viable B cells after 72 hours was much lower in <italic>Slc7a5</italic> fl/fl/Vav-iCre+/- mice compared to WT B cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>). Similarly, while WT B cells proliferated, the majority of the <italic>Slc7a5</italic> fl/fl/Vav-iCre+/- B cells failed to divide, and the number of live B cells after 72 hours was much lower compared to WT B cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4G</xref>, H). In line with the failure to proliferate, there was no evidence of class switching in the remaining <italic>Slc7a5</italic> fl/fl/Vav-iCre+/- B cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4I</xref>). SLC7A5 transports large neutral amino acids, including phenylalanine, histidine, methionine, tryptophan, and isoleucine, as well as the tryptophan metabolite kynurenine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Fotiadis et al, 2013</xref>). As kynurenine is fluorescent and its uptake can be measured by flow cytometry, the effect of LPS + IL-4 treatment on kynurenine uptake in B cells was determined. In line with the increased expression of SLC7A5 in LPS + IL-4 treated B cells, kynurenine uptake was also higher in B cells stimulated with LPS + IL-4 for 24 hours compared to naive B cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4J</xref>). Kynurenine uptake in the LPS + IL-4 stimulated B cells was reduced by the competitive substrate 2-aminobicyclo-(2,2,1)-heptane-2-carboxylic acid (BCH), which inhibits uptake through System L transporters. Kynurenine uptake in <italic>Slc7a5</italic>fl/fl/Vav-iCre+/- B cells was similar to the uptake in BCH-treated WT cells, suggesting that SLC7A5 was the major system L transporter in LPS + IL-4 stimulated B cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4J</xref>). BCH or SLC7A5 knockout did not reduce kynurenine uptake to baseline levels, indicating that other transport mechanisms for kynurenine uptake exist in B cells. Similar results were obtained for B cells stimulated with LPS alone, suggesting that LPS rather than IL-4 is the main driver of kynurenine uptake (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4K</xref>).</p>

<title>Cholesterol metabolism is upregulated in activated B cells</title>
<p>The enrichment analysis (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1H</xref>) suggested that sterol biosynthesis may be upregulated by LPS + IL-4 stimulation. Sterol biosynthesis allows the generation of cholesterol from acetyl-CoA within the cell via a complex multistep process (Figure S4). The 1st half of this pathway, often referred to as the mevalonate pathway, results in the production of farnesyl pyrophosphate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Buhaescu &amp; Izzedine, 2007</xref>). This can be used for several purposes in the cell, including the synthesis of cholesterol via the Bloch or Kandutsch-Russell pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Mitsche et al, 2015</xref>), prompting us to investigate this pathway further. Analysis of proteomic data showed that the majority of enzymes involved in cholesterol biosynthesis were increased in LPS + IL-4 stimulated B cells relative to naive B cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). Cholesterol biosynthesis is controlled by 2 rate-limiting steps: the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonic acid, which is catalysed by HMG-CoA-reductase (HMGCR), and the conversion of squalene to 2,3(<italic>S</italic>)-oxidosqualene, catalysed by squalene monooxygenase (SQLE) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Buhaescu &amp; Izzedine, 2007</xref>). While neither of these enzymes were detected in the proteomic dataset for naive B cells, they were both consistently expressed after LPS + IL-4 stimulation (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>, C). Cells can also obtain cholesterol via the uptake of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) through the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Luo et al, 2020</xref>). Similar to HMGCR and SQLE, the LDLR was not found in naive B cells but was detected in B cells following LPS + IL-4 stimulation (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>).</p>

<p>Cholesterol homeostasis is regulated by the transcription factor SREBP2, which is found as an immature precursor protein embedded in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) with chaperones SCAP and INSIG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Luo et al, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Brown et al, 2018</xref>). Low sterol levels are detected by the sterol-sensing domain of SCAP, leading to the dissociation and degradation of INSIG. Subsequently, the SCAP-SREBP2 complex is transported from the ER to the Golgi apparatus, where it interacts with site 1 and site 2 proteases, allowing cleavage of SREBP2. The mature form of SREBP2 translocates to the nucleus, resulting in the upregulation of genes involved in cholesterol metabolism, including <italic>hmgcr</italic>, <italic>sqle</italic>, and <italic>ldlr</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Luo et al, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Brown et al, 2018</xref>). Low levels of SREBP2 expression were detectable in naïve B cells and became upregulated following LPS + IL-4 stimulation (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref>). Together, the above results suggest that LPS + IL-4 stimulation would drive an increase in cellular cholesterol.</p>
<p>To test this, B cells were stained with the fluorescent dye filipin, which binds to cellular cholesterol. LPS + IL-4 stimulation resulted in a gradual increase in cholesterol levels from 8 hours to 24 hours of stimulation (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5F</xref>). As cells can obtain cholesterol via <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis or uptake of LDL from serum, we compared the effects of culturing B cells in normal serum or serum treated with fumed silica to remove LDL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Brovkovych et al, 2019</xref>). Analysis of the serum indicated that this treatment successfully removed LDL and HDL but did not affect the levels of triglycerides (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Table S2</xref>). Culture in media free of LDL (CF media) did not prevent the increase in filipin staining stimulated by LPS + IL-4 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5G-I</xref>). Inhibitors of cholesterol biosynthesis were titrated to determine what concentration was required to reduce filipin staining in B cells stimulated in CF media. The increase in cholesterol following LPS + IL-4 stimulation could be reduced by the HMGCR inhibitor Fluvastatin or by NB-598, an inhibitor of SQLE (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5G</xref>, H). Cells remained viable after 24 hours of inhibitor treatment with up to 10µM of either inhibitor (Figure S5A-F). Furthermore, the ability of HMGCR inhibition to reduce cholesterol levels did not correlate with effects on cell size, as judged by FSC measurements by flow cytometry after 24 hours (Figure S5B, E). From this, a concentration of 10µM was chosen for both NB-598 and Fluvastatin as this was sufficient to reduce cholesterol as close to naïve B cell levels as possible, but did not cause significant cell death after 24 hours. Different classes of statins have been described to exert different pleiotropic effects <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Greenwood et al, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Oesterle et al, 2017</xref>). Depending on their solubility, statins can be categorised as hydrophilic or lipophilic. Lipophilic statins, such as Fluvastatin, passively diffuse into cells, whereas hydrophilic statins may enter the cell through active transport. In the case of B cells, the use of a more hydrophilic statin, Rosuvastatin, gave similar results to Fluvastatin (Supplementary Figure S5G-J).</p>
<p>The increase in filipin staining following LPS + IL-4 stimulation for 24 hours in normal media was reduced, but not abolished, by either NB-598 or Fluvastatin treatment (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5J</xref>). The ability of NB-598 and Fluvastatin treatment to reduce LPS + IL-4 induced filipin staining was greater in CF media relative to normal media that contains cholesterol (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5J</xref>). Together, these results suggest that B cells may obtain cholesterol via a combination of biosynthesis and uptake.</p>

<p>In addition to cholesterol biosynthesis, the mevalonate pathway is also required for protein prenylation, a process that involves the addition of a farnesyl or geranylgeranyl motif to cysteine residues near the C-terminus of target proteins (Figure S4A) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Wang &amp; Casey, 2016</xref>). As SQLE acts downstream of this branch point, the effects of NB-598 would argue for an important role of cholesterol biosynthesis in LPS + IL-4 induced proliferation; however, they would not exclude a parallel role for protein prenylation. To determine if the inhibitory effects of Fluvastatin in stimulated B cells may be in part due to changes in prenylation, B cells were treated with a prenylation inhibitor, FGTI-2734 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Kazi et al, 2019</xref>), prior to stimulation with LPS + IL-4 for 48 hours. Treatment of cells with FGTI-2734 decreased B cell proliferation in response to LPS + IL-4 stimulation in normal media (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6E</xref>), and in line with this, the number of live B cells also decreased (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6F</xref>). Cell survival was slightly decreased, although not to the same level as seen with Fluvastatin treatment (compare <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6G</xref> to <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6C</xref>). FGTI-2734 did not have a major impact on cell size in normal media (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6H</xref>). Similar effects were observed in CF media, with the exception that FGTI-2734 treated cells were smaller than those stimulated with LPS + IL-4 alone (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6H</xref>)</p>
<p>In theory, the effects of HMGCR inhibitors should be reduced if cells were supplemented with a metabolite downstream of HMGCR in the mevalonate pathway. To test this, the effects of supplementing growth medium with mevalonate, the product generated in the reaction catalysed by HMGCR, were tested. Initially, the ability of mevalonate to rescue the effects of Fluvastatin on filipin staining was examined. For this, a concentration of 2mM mevalonate was used, as initial experiments showed that higher concentrations resulted in cell death and reduced filipin staining (Figure S6). In cells treated for 48 hours with LPS + IL-4, the reduction in filipin caused by Fluvastatin treatment in normal media was reversible by the addition of mevalonate (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A</xref>). In contrast, mevalonate had less effect in cells stimulated for 24 hours with LPS + IL-4, although at this time point, the ability of Fluvastatin to reduce filipin staining was also less pronounced than at 48 hours (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A</xref>).

<p>The effect of Fluvastatin on cell survival was partially reversible by the addition of mevalonate in normal media, which restored cell survival to 80% (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7C</xref>) and fully restored cell size relative to cells stimulated with LPS and IL-4 in the absence of Fluvastatin (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7D</xref>).

<p>Given that GGPP should rescue prenylation but not cholesterol metabolism, its effects on proliferation are unexpected if B cells need cholesterol to proliferate. We therefore tested if GGPP affected cholesterol levels in Fluvastatin treated B cells. As seen in previous experiments, Fluvastatin reduced the ability of LPS + IL-4 stimulation to increase cholesterol levels at both 24 hours and 48 hours of treatment. GGPP was able to partially rescue this at both time points (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8I</xref>). This was in contrast to mevalonate, which could only be rescued at 48 hours (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A</xref>), an observation that may, in part, explain why GGPP was more effective at restoring proliferation in the presence of Fluvastatin than mevalonate. The effects of GGPP on cholesterol levels were, however, limited to normal media, as similar to mevalonate, GGPP did not rescue to effect of Fluvastatin on filipin staining in CF media (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8J</xref>).</p>

<p>Given the effects of HMGCR inhibition on cholesterol levels following LPS stimulation, we also tested whether other stimuli known to activate B cell proliferation could increase cholesterol levels. Murine B cells also respond to TLR7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Weeratna et al, 2005</xref>) and TLR9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Arunkumar et al, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">Yi et al, 1998</xref>) agonists. Both the TLR7 agonist Resiquimod and the TLR9 agonist CpG increased cholesterol levels in B cells (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8B</xref>). Naive B cells can also be activated <italic>ex vivo</italic> by ligation of their BCR with anti-IgM antibodies or by stimulation with CD40 ligand (CD40L). Similar to TLR agonists, both stimuli also increased cholesterol levels in B cells (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9B</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we have used proteomic analysis to highlight the switch in metabolic demand from naïve B cells in a resting state to LPS + IL-4 activated B cells, which significantly increase their energy and biosynthetic requirements to sustain growth, proliferation, and class switching.</p>
<p>Upon activation, B cells upregulated several amino acid transporters, including the system L transporters SLC7A5 and 6 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>), which can import large neutral amino acids, including the essential amino acids histidine, isoleucine, leucine, methionine, phenylalanine, threonine, tryptophan, and valine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Fotiadis et al, 2013</xref>). Of these 2 transporters, SLC7A5 was expressed at a higher level and was responsible for the majority of amino acid uptake via system 1 transporters (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4I</xref>). SLC7A5 forms a dimer with CD98 (SLC3A2) to form an active transporter. SLC7A5 is not, however, the only binding partner of CD98, as it can also bind to the SLC7A11 and SLC7A6 transporters or interact with integrins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Kahya et al, 2021</xref>). Previous work has shown that mice with B cell-specific deletions of CD98 presented normal development of B cells in the bone marrow, but significantly lower levels of class-switched IgG due to the inhibition of B cell proliferation and plasma cell formation following the activation of naive B cells in the periphery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Cantor et al, 2009</xref>). The defect in proliferation was attributed to defective integrin signalling rather than an impairment in amino acid transport, based on the deletion of the integrin or amino acid transporter regions in CD98. Knockout of SLC7A5 in either hematopoietic cells or B cells has been previously shown not to affect the number of splenic B cells in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Sinclair et al, 2013</xref>), although a separate study found a decrease in the number of peritoneal B1 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Sun et al, 2023</xref>). While not critical for initial B cell development, SLC7A5 was critical for the survival and expansion of B cells in response to <italic>ex vivo</italic> stimulation with LPS + IL-4 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F-I</xref>). Of note, recent research in human B cells has shown that stimulation with CpG increases SLC7A5 expression, which in turn transports L-leucine into the cell and facilitates mTORC1 activation, which was required for IgG production and inflammatory cytokine secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Torigoe et al, 2019</xref>).</p>
<p>Similar observations have been made in T cells, where SLC7A5 is not required for initial T cell development but is required for the clonal expansion and effector functions of T cells following activation via the T cell receptor in the periphery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Sinclair et al, 2013</xref>). This suggests that B cells, similar to T cells, may rely on different amino acid transporters at different points in their development. The expression of SLC7A5 following T cell activation has been shown to require the transcription factor c-Myc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Marchingo et al, 2020</xref>). While the role of c-Myc was not directly addressed in this study, analysis of the proteomic data presented here does show that c-Myc was increased by LPS stimulation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="tbls3">Table S3</xref>). This is consistent with previous reports showing an upregulation of c-Myc in response to several B cell activating stimuli, including LPS, CD40, and the BCR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Luo et al, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Dominguez-Sola et al, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Calado et al, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Tesi et al, 2019</xref>). While in T cells, c-Myc regulates metabolic changes, including the expression of SC7A5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Sinclair &amp; Cantrell, 2025</xref>), this has not been studied to the same degree in B cells. Of note, transcriptional profiling following LPS stimulation of B cells has suggested that SLCA5 mRNA induction in response to LPS can occur in the absence of c-Myc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Tesi et al, 2019</xref>), suggesting the regulation of SLC7A5 may not be identical between T and B cells.</p>
<p>As B cells expand and divide, they will require an increase in lipids to generate new membrane. Cholesterol is an important lipid component of the plasma membrane, which affects membrane fluidity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Luo et al, 2020</xref>) and has also been implicated in the regulation of several receptors, including the BCR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Bléry et al, 2006</xref>). The regulation of cholesterol levels in cells is therefore closely controlled at the level of both cholesterol biosynthesis and its uptake via the endocytosis of LDL particles. Low levels of cholesterol in the endoplasmic reticulum are detected by the transcription factor SREBP2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Luo et al, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Brown et al, 2018</xref>). The importance of this system in B cells was recently demonstrated by the conditional knockout of SCAP in B cells, a key regulator of SREBP1 and 2. While this did not prevent the development of B cells or their levels at steady state in mice, it did prevent the activation and proliferation of B cells in response to antigens and thus compromised the humoral immune response. SCAP deletion will, however, affect both SREBP1 and 2 function and therefore have wider effects on lipid metabolism beyond its effects on cholesterol. We show here that in response to several activating stimuli <italic>ex vivo</italic>, including LPS, B cells upregulate cholesterol, and that blocking HMGCR, a key rate-limiting enzyme in the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway, inhibits B cell proliferation. In the case of LPS stimulation, B cells seem to be able to obtain cholesterol by both uptake and biosynthesis. For example, B cells can still increase their cholesterol levels in the absence of LDL in the cell culture medium. In addition, NB-598, an inhibitor of the 2nd rate-limiting enzyme in the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway, can reduce the ability of LPS to increase cholesterol levels. In contrast, the greater effect of NB-598 on cholesterol levels of B cells grown in CF media relative to normal media, and the inability of mevalonate to rescue the effects of statin treatment in CF media, would indicate that B cells also use LDL uptake as a source of cholesterol. In line with this, B cells upregulated the LDLR following activation (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>). The precise balance between these two mechanisms may depend on the duration of stimulation and the availability of LDL in the extracellular environment.</p>
<p>In line with our results, following CD40 mediated activation of human B cells, Atorvastatin was reported to inhibit human B cell proliferation and the expression of the activation markers CD80 and CD86 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Shimabukuro-Vornhagen et al, 2014</xref>). Interpretation of the effects of statins on B cells is, however, complex. Statins inhibit HMGCR, the rate-limiting enzyme in the mevalonate pathway that is required for the initial steps in cholesterol biosynthesis. This pathway generates farnesyl pyrophosphate, an intermediate that can feed into not only cholesterol biosynthesis, but also protein prenylation and ubiquinone pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Mullen et al, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Wang &amp; Casey, 2016</xref>). Thus, the effects of statins reported here could be due not only to their effects on cholesterol, but also via these other pathways. Prenylation has been linked to proliferation in several cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Su et al, 2020</xref>), including T cells, where Simvastatin inhibits activation via two mechanisms, one of which involves blocking the prenylation of Ras and Rac (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Ghittoni et al, 2005</xref>). We therefore investigated whether statin-mediated effects on B cell survival and proliferation were in part due to prenylation. We found that FGTI-2734, an inhibitor of FTase and GGTase, blocked LPS + IL-4 induced B cell proliferation, suggesting an important role for prenylation in B cells. In agreement with this, prenylation has also been reported to be important in B cells for the expression of CD80 and CD86 following stimulation via CD40, although its role in proliferation was not directly addressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Shimabukuro-Vornhagen et al, 2014</xref>). Given that prenylation can target a large number of proteins, including many members of the Ras GTPase superfamily, to regulate their cellular localisation, the effects of blocking prenylation in B cells are likely to be complex. Interestingly, GGPP, which is needed for protein geranylgeranylation (a form of protein prenylation), was able to rescue the effects of Fluvastatin on LPS + IL-4 stimulated B cells. Notably, it was more efficient than mevalonate at restoring proliferation in the Fluvastatin treated cells. This ability to rescue proliferation was unexpected, as GGPP would not directly feed into the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway, and other experiments described here using CF media and squalene monooxygenase inhibitors argue for a requirement for cholesterol for B cell proliferation. We therefore looked at its effect on cholesterol levels and found that it was able to rescue the effects of Fluvastatin in normal but not CF media. This could be explained by prenylation being required for cholesterol uptake but not biosynthesis. Cholesterol uptake via the LDLR requires the clathrin-mediated endocytosis of the LDLR and its trafficking to endosomes, where cholesterol is released from LDL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Nguyen et al, 2025</xref>). Vesicle trafficking is regulated via the action of a number of Rab GTPases, including Rab5, which is recruited to early endosomes and regulates their maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">Zhao et al, 2025</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">Zeigerer et al, 2012</xref>). More significantly, Rab5 prenylation has been shown to be important for its correct targeting to endosomes and therefore its biological function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Gomes et al, 2003</xref>). Treatment of cells with statins to inhibit prenylation has previously been shown to affect Rab subcellular localisation and vesicle trafficking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Ali et al, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Ronzier et al, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">Xia et al, 2018</xref>). Loss of the prenylation of the Rab proteins involved in LDLR endocytosis could therefore negatively impact this process, leading to a failure of LDL uptake into the B cell. Prenylation is also likely to impact other processes in B cells, for example, TLR9-induced IL-10 production by regulatory B cells has been found to require geranylgeranylation and not farnesylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Bibby et al, 2020</xref>). Further work will be needed to uncover the proteins prenylated upon B cell activation and determine the effects of prenylation on their function.</p>
<p>Overall, the proteomic analysis described here supports that B cells undergo a major reorganisation of metabolic pathways following TLR activation. Naïve B cells exist in a quiescent state where they do not grow or proliferate and express low levels of metabolic enzymes. Conversely, B cells stimulated with LPS + IL-4 massively upregulate metabolic enzymes involved in processes including protein synthesis, amino acid uptake, and cholesterol metabolism, which is required to support an increase in cell size, proliferation, and antibody class switching. Most significantly, we found that LPS + IL-4 stimulated B cells depended on both cholesterol biosynthesis, cholesterol uptake, and prenylation for expansion and proliferation.</p>

<title>Proteomics</title>
<p>Wildtype C57BL/6 mice (Charles Rivers) aged between 8 and 12 weeks were used for all proteomic experiments. Lymph nodes were extracted from mice, mashed in RPMI media before filtering through a 70μm cell strainer. Naïve B cells were purified by fluorescence-activated cell sorting. Lymphocytes were incubated with Fc receptor-blocking anti-CD16/CD32 antibody (BD Pharmingen) in FACS buffer for 15 minutes at 4 C before staining with fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>) in FACS buffer for 20 minutes at 4 C. The samples were washed with FACS buffer prior to resuspension in 0.5 μg/ml of DAPI. CD19+,CD93-, DAPI-cells were sorted using a Sony SH800 cell sorter. Sorted cells were washed twice with HBSS and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen to be stored at -80 °C until processing for mass spectrometry. For B cell activation, lymphocytes were suspended at a final density of 1.5 million cells/ml in medium (RPMI-1640 containing glutamine supplemented with 10% FBS, 50 U/ml penicillin-streptomycin, 50 µM 2-mercaptoethanol) and activated for 24 hours in the presence of 20µg/ml LPS and 10ng/ml IL-4.

Cells were then washed 3 times in PBS and cell pellets frozen at -80°C.</p>
<p>Cell pellets were lysed and proteins were digested following the protocol described by (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Baker et al, 2022</xref>). In brief, 400 ml of lysis buffer (5% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 50 mM triethylammonium bicarbonate (pH 8.5) and 10 mM tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine-hydrochloride) was added to each sample and lysates shaken at room temperature at 1000 rpm for 5 minutes before being incubated at 95 °C at 500 rpm for 5 minutes. Samples were allowed to cool and were then sonicated using a BioRuptor (15 cycles: 30 sec on and 30 sec off) and alkylated with 20mM iodoacetamide for 1 h at 22 °C in the dark. To determine protein concentration the EZQ protein quantitation kit (Thermo) was used and protein cleanup and digestion was performed using S-TRAP mini columns (Protifi). Proteins were digested with trypsin at 1:20 ratio (enzyme:protein) for 2 hours at 47°C. Digested peptides were eluted from S-TRAP columns using 50mM ammonium bicarbonate, followed by 0.2% aqueous formic acid and 50% aqueous acetonitrile containing 0.2% formic acid.

<p>Peptides were analysed by single shot Data Independent Aquisiation (DIA) mass spectrometry as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Molina-Gonzalez et al, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Sollberger et al, 2024</xref>). 1.5 µg of peptide from each sample was injected onto a nanoscale C18 reverse-phase chromatography system (UltiMate 3000 RSLC nano, Thermo Scientific) and electrosprayed into an Orbitrap Exploris 480 Mass Spectrometer (Thermo Fisher). The following buffers were used for liquid chromatography: buffer A (0.1% formic acid in Milli-Q water (v/v)) and buffer B (80% acetonitrile and 0.1% formic acid in Milli-Q water (v/v). Samples were loaded at 10 μl/min onto a trap column (100 μm × 2 cm, PepMap nanoViper C18 column, 5 μm, 100 Å, Thermo Scientific) equilibrated in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA). The trap column was washed for 3 min at the same flow rate with 0.1% TFA then switched in-line with a Thermo Scientific, resolving C18 column (75 μm × 50 cm, PepMap RSLC C18 column, 2 μm, 100 Å). Peptides were eluted from the column at a constant flow rate of 300 nl/min with a linear gradient from 3% buffer B to 6% buffer B in 5 min, then from 6% buffer B to 35% buffer B in 115 min, and finally to 80% buffer B within 7 min. The column was then washed with 80% buffer B for 4 min and re-equilibrated in 3% buffer B for 15 min. Two blanks were run between each sample to reduce carry-over. The column was kept at a constant temperature of 50°C.</p>
<p>The data was acquired using an easy spray source operated in positive mode with spray voltage at 2.445 kV, and the ion transfer tube temperature at 250°C. The MS was operated in DIA mode. A scan cycle comprised a full MS scan (m/z range from 350 to 1650), with RF lens at 40%, AGC target set to custom, normalised AGC target at 300%, maximum injection time mode set to custom, maximum injection time at 20 ms, microscan set to 1 and source fragmentation disabled. MS survey scan was followed by MS/MS DIA scan events using the following parameters: multiplex ions set to false, collision energy mode set to stepped, collision energy type set to normalized, HCD collision energies set to 25.5, 27 and 30%, orbitrap resolution 30,000, first mass 200, RF lens 40%, AGC target set to custom, normalized AGC target 3000%, microscan set to 1 and maximum injection time 55 ms. Data for both MS scan and MS/MS DIA scan events were acquired in profile mode.</p>

<p>The work presented by Cheung et al. used a quantitative proteomics method to capture molecular changes in B cells exposed to LPS and IL-4, a combination of stimuli activating naive B cells. Amino acid transporters, cholesterol biosynthetic enzymes, ribosomal components, and other proteins involved in cell proliferation were found to increase in stimulated B cells. Experiments involving genetic loss-of-function (SLC7A5), pharmacological inhibition (HMGCR, SQLE, prenylation), and functional rescue by metabolites (mevalonate, GGPP) validated the proteomics data and revealed that amino acid uptake, cholesterol/mevalonate biosynthesis, and cholesterol uptake played a crucial role in B cell proliferation, survival, biogenesis, and immunoglobulin class switching. Experiments involving cholesterol-free medium showed that both biosynthesis and LDLR-mediated uptake catered to the cholesterol demand of LPS/IL-4-stimulated B cells. A role for protein prenylation in LDLR-mediated cholesterol uptake was postulated and backed by divergent effects of GGPP rescue in the presence and absence of cholesterol in culture medium.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The discovery was made by proteome-wide profiling and unbiased computational analysis. The discovered proteins were functionally validated using appropriate tools and approaches. The metabolic processes identified and prioritized from this comprehensive survey and systematic validation are highly likely to represent mechanisms of high importance and influence. Analysis of immune cell metabolism at the protein level is relatively compared to transcriptomic and metabolomic analysis.</p>
<p>The conclusions from functional validation experiments were supported by clear data and based on rational interpretations. This was enabled by well-established readouts/analytical methods used to analyze cell proliferation, viability, size, cholesterol content, and transporter/enzyme function. The data generated from these experiments strongly support the conclusions.</p>
<p>This work reveals a complex, yet intriguing, relationship between cholesterol metabolism and protein prenylation as they serve to promote B cell activation. The effects of pharmacological inhibition and metabolite replenishment on the cholesterol content and activation of B cells were precisely determined and logically interpreted.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The findings of this study were obtained almost exclusively from ex vivo B cell stimulation experiments. Their contribution to B cell state and B-cell-mediated immune responses in vivo was not explored. Without in vivo data, the study still provides valuable mechanistic information and insights, but it remains unknown, and there is no discussion about how the identified mechanisms may play out in B cell immunity.</p>
<p>The role of HMGCR, SQLE, and prenylation in B cell activation was assessed using pharmacological inhibitors. Evidence from other loss-of-function approaches, which could strengthen the conclusions, does not exist. This is a moderate weakness.</p>

<p>This study uses mass spectrometry to quantify how LPS and IL-4 modify the mouse B cell proteome as naïve cells undergo blastogenesis and enter the cell cycle. This analysis revealed changes in key proteins involved in amino acid transport and cholesterol biosynthesis. Genetic and pharmacological experiments indicated important roles for these metabolic processes in B cell proliferation.</p>
<p>This work provides new information about the regulation of TI B cell responses by changes in cell metabolism and also a comprehensive mass spectrometry dataset, which will be an important general resource for future studies. The experiments are thorough and carefully carried out. The majority of conclusions are backed up by data that is shown to be highly significant statistically.</p>
<p>The study would be strengthened by additional experiments to determine whether the detected changes are unique to stimulation with LPS + IL-4 or more generic responses of resting B cells to mitogenic agonists.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #1:</bold></p>
<p>We agree with the reviewer that a limitation of our study is its focus on cell-based assays rather than <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments. We did consider evaluating the effects of statins on B cell responses <italic>in vivo</italic>; however, this approach is complicated by findings that statins can influence antigen presentation by dendritic cells, thereby impacting antibody responses (Xia <italic>et al,</italic> 2018). One possible solution would be to use B cell-specific conditional knockout models to study the roles of the identified proteins in an <italic>in vivo</italic> context. However, we currently do not have access to these models and were therefore unable to include such experiments within a feasible timeframe. We will revise the discussion section to acknowledge these points.</p>
<p>The reviewer also noted that our study assessed the roles of HMGCR, SQLE, and prenylation in B cell activation using pharmacological inhibitors and genetic knockdown/out approaches. Loss-of-function techniques such as RNAi, siRNA, and CRISPR can be challenging to apply to primary B cells, but we are exploring their feasibility for future revisions. While we acknowledge the limitations of using pharmacological inhibitors, we have taken several steps to mitigate these, including targeting multiple steps in the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway using structurally distinct inhibitors and conducting rescue experiments by supplementing downstream metabolites. To further investigate potential off-target effects of statins, we have recently performed proteomic analysis of B cells treated with and without fluvastatin. The data suggest that fluvastatin primarily affects cholesterol metabolism and does not cause widespread off-target effects. We will include this new data in the revised manuscript.</p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #2:</bold></p>
<p>The reviewer suggested that the study would be strengthened by determining whether the observed changes are specific to LPS + IL-4 stimulation or represent a more general B cell response to mitogenic signals.</p>
<p>A complementary study by James et al. (James <italic>et al,</italic> 2024) investigated murine B cells stimulated via the B cell receptor (BCR) and CD40, using anti-IgM and anti-CD40 antibodies alongside IL-4. Their proteomic analysis showed that such co-stimulation induces a fivefold increase in total cellular protein mass within 24 hours, mirroring our findings with LPS + IL-4. They also reported upregulation of proteins associated with cell cycle progression, ribosome biogenesis, and amino acid transport. Furthermore, by using SLC7A5 knockout mice, they demonstrated that this transporter is required for B cell activation. We will expand our discussion to include and these findings.  We will also expand on the final figure in our paper showing that the effects of statins are not limited to LPS.</p>
