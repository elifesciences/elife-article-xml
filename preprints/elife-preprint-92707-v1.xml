<title>Summary</title><p>The metabolite 2-hydroxybutyrate (2HB) is produced by skeletal muscle acutely during exercise and persists for several hours in the blood post-exertion. We show here that 2HB directly inhibits branched- chain aminotransferase enzymes, and that this inhibition in turn triggers a SIRT4-dependent shift in the compartmental abundance of protein ADP-ribosylation. The 2HB-induced decrease in nuclear protein ADP-ribosylation leads to a C/EBPβ mediated transcriptional response in the branched-chain amino acid degradation pathway. This response to 2HB exposure leads to an improved oxidative capacity both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>, with the latter mimicking the effects of exercise training on whole body metabolism. Thus, we show here that 2-HB production by skeletal muscle represents a novel mechanism for the modification of metabolism by exercise.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Physical exertion is a metabolic challenge that requires physiological responses throughout the body, including a dramatic change to metabolic flux patterns<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. During exercise, metabolic end products accumulate and are released into the circulation; prototypical examples of such molecules include hypoxanthine and lactate. Metabolic intermediates of pathways with increased flux during exercise may also exhibit increased levels in the circulation post-exercise, particularly as an indication of pathway saturation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. Accumulation of individual exercise-induced metabolites may lead to a diverse range of cellular responses in different tissues, with acute and lasting effects on physiology. Such mechanisms have been defined for succinate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>, lactate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>, hypoxanthine<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>, and other exerkines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>, demonstrating that the exercise-induced metabolome includes factors with significant physiological effects.</p>
<p>Exercise-induced lactate and succinate exert effects on physiology despite a relatively rapid return to baseline levels during recovery post-exercise. Conversely, 2-hydroxybutyrate (2HB, also known as α-hydroxybutyrate) is an exercise-induced metabolite with plasma concentrations that continue to increase for at least 3 hours after exertion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>. Production of the majority of 2HB in circulation has been attributed to the liver, although 2HB accumulates in many other tissues post- exercise<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. 2HB is also present in disease states, as untargeted metabolomics analyses have identified 2HB as a metabolic marker for infection severity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>, and as an indicator of metabolic disorders<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. Cellular responses to accumulated 2HB have not been characterized to date, although Sato, et al., report that exogenous administration of 2HB caused an acute shift in mouse whole body metabolism, including a reduction in the respiratory exchange ratio (RER), and increased blood glucose<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>; indicating that 2HB has the potential to alter metabolism.</p>
<p>2HB is the product of a lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)-mediated reduction of 2-ketobutyrate (2KB), which itself is a byproduct of endogenous cysteine synthesis via the transsulfuration pathway. Oxidation of 2KB is not well characterized beyond isolated enzyme assays; these show it to be a substrate for the branched chain keto acid dehydrogenase complex (BCKDH)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>. BCKDH converts 2KB to propionyl-CoA, which can be re-carboxylated by propionyl-CoA carboxylase (PCC), producing the tri-carboxylic acid (TCA) cycle intermediate succinyl-CoA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. Mammalian cells are not capable of reverse transsulfuration, i.e., production of methionine from cysteine; thus, the metabolic fate of 2KB is driven by the balance between mitochondrial oxidation or reduction to 2HB. Importantly, the metabolism of exogenous 2HB has not been described. Based upon the current literature, the fate of 2HB depends on the capacity for LDH-dependent oxidation of 2HB, and thus, 2KB metabolic homeostasis.</p>
<p>2HB is an alpha-hydroxy carboxylic acid similar to 2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG). The latter is a dicarboxylic acid, and an established physiological competitor of α-ketoglutarate (αKG). Both the <italic>S</italic>- and <italic>R</italic>- enantiomers of 2HG are known to competitively inhibit αKG-dependent enzymatic reactions, including the branched chain amino-transferase (BCAT) enzymes, and the much broader family of αKG-dependent dioxygenases (αKGDD)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. αKGDDs include regulators of the cellular responses to hypoxia, the prolyl hydroxylase (PHD) and factor inhibiting HIF (FIH), and epigenetic regulators such as lysine demethylases (KDM), among others. Regulation of these targets by endogenous or exogenous <italic>S</italic>-2HG is sufficient to alter numerous cell fate decisions, e.g., the differentiation of cytotoxic CD8 T cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. <italic>R</italic>-2HG inhibition of BCAT is reported to reduce metabolism of branched chain amino acids (BCAA), leading to reduced levels of glutamate and glutathione<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. As an alpha- hydroxy acid, we hypothesised that 2HB may be a novel competitive inhibitor of αKGDDs or BCATs.</p>
<p>In this work we investigate the physiological and molecular role of 2HB. We find that cells treated with 2HB demonstrate a metabolic response that leads to transcriptional regulation of BCAA degradation enzymes via a BCAT2 and SIRT4-dependent shift in compartmental protein ADP- ribosylation (ADPr). The reduced ADPr in the nuclear compartment following 2HB treatment promotes binding of the transcription factor CCAAT enhancer binding protein beta (C/EBPβ) to the promoters of BCAA degradation genes. We find that repeated administration of 2HB to mice increases oxidative capacity in exercise tests that replicates the effect of exercise training. Finally, we find repeated 2HB treatment gives rise to an improved resistance to fatigue in oxidative skeletal muscle, consistent with the improvement to oxidative metabolism. Overall, we find that 2HB induces a range of cellular responses that are consistent with it being a feedback signal from exertion, one that leads to increased capacity in the BCAA degradation pathway and improved exercise performance.</p>

<title>Daily 2HB treatment accelerates the metabolic response to exercise in mice</title>
<p>As described above, physical exertion induces a persistent increase to circulating 2HB. To investigate the role of 2HB in whole animal metabolism, we first subjected mice to daily incremental exhaustive exercise tests for five consecutive days. Immediately following each test, mice were injected with 1 mmol/kg of Na2HB, or an equivalent dose of NaCl as a control (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.1A</xref>). Mouse basal VO<sub>2</sub>, maximum ΔVO<sub>2</sub> (change in VO<sub>2</sub> relative to basal VO<sub>2</sub>), RER, and ΔVO<sub>2</sub> throughout exercise were similar across treatment groups on the first day, prior to group randomization (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.1B-D</xref>,<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">SFig.1A</xref>). Median mouse ΔVO<sub>2</sub>max was 507 mL/kg/hr on the first day (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.1C</xref>) and mice tended to reach exhaustion during the 21 m/min phase (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.1E</xref>). Beyond 18 m/min, mice either further increased their VO<sub>2</sub> or reached exhaustion. This is demonstrated by the lack of correlation between ΔVO<sub>2</sub> during 18 m/min and time-to-exhaustion, but a significant correlation between either ΔVO<sub>2</sub> during 21 m/min or maximum ΔVO<sub>2</sub> and time-to-exhaustion (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">SFig.1B</xref>). These data demonstrate that increased oxidative capacity predicts improved performance in incremental exercise tests.</p>

<p>Mouse ΔVO<sub>2</sub>max tended to increase with subsequent exercise tests and had significantly improved to a median of 877 mL/kg/hr in the control group by day 5 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.1C</xref>). Accordingly, progressively more mice reached the 24 m/min phase before exhaustion (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.1E</xref>). Mice treated with 2HB showed improvement to ΔVO<sub>2</sub>max in subsequent exercise tests as early as day 3, and increased ΔVO<sub>2</sub>max up to 930 mL/kg/hr on day 5 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.1C</xref>). These data demonstrate a benefit to exercise performance from a brief one-week protocol of exercise training in mice and suggest that combination with exogenous 2HB may accelerate this effect.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2b">
<title>Daily 2HB treatment recapitulates the benefits of exercise training on oxidative capacity</title>
<p>We next investigated the effects of exogenous 2HB alone. Firstly, we assessed the effects of acute administration of 1 mmol/kg of Na2HB. For mice at rest, we observed no effect of exogenous 2HB on oxygen consumption or RER compared with NaCl control over the first 60 minutes, consistent with previous reports for this dose (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">SFig.1C,D</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. We next administered 2HB 2 hours prior to an exhaustive exercise test. Both 2HB-treated and control mice reached a ΔVO<sub>2</sub>max of approximately 500 mL/kg/hr, with no difference in RER, time-to-exhaustion, resting VO<sub>2</sub>, or ΔVO<sub>2</sub> during the exercise tests (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.1F</xref>, <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">SFig.1E,F</xref>). These data indicate that exogenous 2HB at a dose of 1 mmol/kg does not acutely alter resting metabolism or oxygen consumption during exercise.</p>
<p>Next, we investigated whether treatment with 2HB would alter exercise performance on subsequent days. First, a cohort of mice was treated with 2HB 24 hours prior to an exhaustive exercise test. In these mice there was again no difference between groups in terms of resting VO<sub>2</sub>, ΔVO<sub>2</sub> or RER during the exercise test, time-to-exhaustion, or ΔVO<sub>2</sub>max (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.1G</xref>, <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">SFig.1E,F</xref>). When mice were treated with 2HB each day for four days with the exhaustive exercise test on the fifth day, 2HB- treated mice exhibited an increased ΔVO2 during the exercise test, with differences more apparent at greater treadmill speeds (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1H</xref>). Oxygen consumption at higher treadmill speeds correlated with greater time-to-exhaustion, indicating effective oxidative capacity as opposed to metabolic inefficiency (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">SFig.1G</xref>). Mice treated with 2HB exhibited a greater ΔVO<sub>2</sub>max and greater time-to- exhaustion, but had similar basal VO<sub>2</sub> and RER levels throughout exercise, relative to exercising NaCl- treated controls (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.1H</xref>, <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">SFig.1E,F</xref>). Control mice exhibited a median ΔVO<sub>2</sub>max of 572 ml/kg/hr. However, 2HB-treated mice exhibited a median ΔVO<sub>2</sub>max of 828 mL/kg/hr, similar to exercise- trained mice (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.1C,H</xref>). These data indicate that repeated 2HB treatment replicates the improvement to mouse oxidative capacity and exercise performance produced from daily exercise training.</p>

<title>2HB levels are correlated with metabolic indicators of BCAA degradation in murine datasets</title>
<p>To determine which metabolic pathways 2HB may affect, we were next interested in determining which metabolites are most correlated with 2HB post-exercise. We analyzed two published datasets reporting untargeted metabolomics in mice subjected to a treadmill-based exercise protocol, or sham control<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. Both studies observe a strong increase to 2HB in the circulation and in all assessed organs post-exercise (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">SFig.2A</xref>). A correlation analysis demonstrates a reliable positive correlation between circulating 2HB and markers of BCAA metabolism (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig.2A</xref>). Overrepresentation analysis of BCAA-related metabolites positively correlated with 2HB post- exercise yielded p values of 3.8×10<sup>-5</sup> and 1.6×10<sup>-2</sup> for the two studies. These data suggest that accumulation of 2HB is correlated to the metabolic flux through the BCAA degradation pathway.</p>

<title>Human exercise studies demonstrate the persistence of serum 2HB post-exercise</title>
<p>We further investigated this pattern by assessing the plasma metabolomics of human subjects in a previously published dataset from our group. In this study, blood was sampled prior to exercise, immediately post-exercise, and then one-hour post-exercise. Few markers of BCAA degradation are available in the human dataset, so we focused on the amino acid, the keto acid, and the hydroxy acid versions of leucine, isoleucine, valine, and 2HB. Transamination of BCAA to the respective keto acid is the first step towards mitochondrial oxidation. In line with this, BCAA levels are reduced immediately post-exercise compared with pre-exercise levels, while keto acids and hydroxy acids are increased (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig.2B</xref>). The accumulation of 2HB alongside increased BCAA degradation is consistent with a model wherein BCAAs compete with 2KB for early oxidation steps, e.g., the BCKDH and PCC-mediated reactions.</p>
<p>Indicating a return to homeostasis, one-hour after completion of exercise, BCAAs increase and keto acids decrease towards pre-exercise levels (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig.2B</xref>). The hydroxy acids are intriguing, as these remain significantly greater than pre-exercise levels even one-hour after completion of exercise, suggesting slow clearance of all members of this metabolite group, including 2HB. Among the hydroxy acids, 2HB is the standout, with the greatest fold-increase at the one-hour time point and the greatest absolute abundance in both human and mouse datasets<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. Collectively, these data describe a positive correlation for the production of 2HB in proportion with production of branched chain keto acids (BCKA) during exercise. The slow clearance of 2HB and the branched chain hydroxy acids (BCHA) represent a possible indication of saturation in the capacity for the oxidation of 2KB and BCKAs.</p>

<title>Repeated 2HB treatment alters BCAA metabolite balance following exercise</title>
<p>We next investigated whether repeated treatment of 2HB for four days would alter BCAA metabolism during an exercise test on the fifth day. To limit mouse dropout from exhaustion, the exercise protocol increased speed only up to 18m/min. This speed was held for 30 minutes for all mice (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig.2C</xref>). There was no effect of 2HB treatment on basal VO<sub>2</sub>, or on RER throughout the exercise protocol (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig.2D-F</xref>). 2HB-treated mice tended to spend more time running on the treadmill, indicated by an increased ΔVO<sub>2</sub> during the 18m/min segment of the exercise protocol (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig.2D,G</xref>). These data demonstrate again that repeated 2HB treatment increases oxidative capacity during exercise.</p>
<p>We hypothesized that the change to exercise performance, in both the incremental exercise tests to exhaustion and moderate exercise tests, was in part due to a change in skeletal muscle metabolism during exercise. Untargeted metabolomics of mouse serum, red gastrocnemius, and white gastrocnemius collected immediately post-exercise shows modest clustering of mice based on treatment group in the serum, separating vehicle-treated sedentary controls from other treatment groups (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig.2H</xref>). Conversely, we observe strong clustering in the red and white gastrocnemius, delineating each experimental group (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig.2I,J</xref>). These data begin to suggest that skeletal muscle is a site of metabolic regulation by 2HB.</p>
<p>When we visualize the data trends in the BCAA metabolic pathway within each tissue (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig.2K,L</xref>), a shift in the BCAA, BCKA, and BCHA appears to be exercise and 2HB dependent; specifically 2HB treatment appears to reduce BCAA levels in red gastrocnemius at rest and during exercise, but increase BCKA and decrease the hydroxy acids during exercise (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig.2L</xref>). The levels of intermediates within the BCAA degradation pathway increase in each compartment with exercise, with no strong effect of 2HB. These data suggest a shift in red gastrocnemius BCAA homeostasis induced by 2HB treatment.</p>
<p>To compare the effects of 2HB given the quantifiable difference in exercise performance (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig.2D-G</xref>), we adjusted metabolite values based on VO<sub>2</sub> measures during the exercise protocol or sham control. This adjustment yields values that indicate whether the levels of a given metabolite were high or low relative to the matching VO<sub>2</sub> measures for each mouse. We observed a number of differences and trends in the red gastrocnemius muscle: reduced levels of BCAA at rest and post- exercise, increased BCKA post-exercise, reduced BCHA post-exercise, and reduced 2HB post-exercise (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">SFig.2B</xref>). In white gastrocnemius we only observe a reduction to BCAA and the BCHA post-exercise (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">SFig.2C</xref>). Each of these effects are weaker in the serum VO<sub>2</sub>-adjusted data (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">SFig.2D</xref>). These data demonstrate that 2HB treatment alters muscle BCAA metabolic balance in excess of the changes to mouse VO<sub>2</sub> during exercise.</p>

<title>2KB is a fuel for oxidative metabolism</title>
<p>The metabolomics analysis led us to hypothesize that physiological 2HB accumulation is associated with competition for the BCAA degradation pathway, limiting oxidation of 2KB. However, despite validation as a substrate for BCKDH in isolated enzyme assays<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>, 2KB has not been validated as a potential fuel for mitochondrial oxidative metabolism. Thus, we next aimed to investigate the potential of 2HB and 2KB as fuel for oxidative metabolism <italic>in vitro</italic> and dependency of 2KB oxidation on the BCAA degradation pathway. We subjected cells to Seahorse assays monitoring the oxygen consumption rate (OCR) during a standard ‘mitochondrial stress test’ protocol following acute administration of 500-5000 μM of either Na2HB, Na2KB, or NaCl control (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig.3A,B</xref>). With C2C12 myoblasts, we found a modest increase to OCR immediately following 2KB addition, with no response to 2HB (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig.3A,B</xref>). Presence of 2HB or 2KB provided a small increase to the maximum OCR. We hypothesized that the standard assay media saturated cells with fuel, leaving little capacity for 2HB or 2KB as a fuel. We therefore repeated the assays with no pyruvate in the medium. Similarly, an acute uptick in OCR was observed upon addition of 2KB, but not 2HB (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig.3A,B</xref>). There was now a dose-dependent increase to maximal OCR in cells treated with 2KB, up to a similar magnitude when pyruvate was included. Addition of 2HB was not able to recapitulate the maximum OCR observed when pyruvate was present in the media. These trends could be replicated with mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF), although with a lower magnitude (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">SFig.3A</xref>). These data demonstrate that 2KB is a substantially greater fuel for oxidative metabolism than 2HB.</p>

<p>It is possible that the increase to maximal OCR induced by 2KB is due to 2KB promoting glycolysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>, instead of 2KB being used as a fuel. To investigate the importance of the BCAA degradation pathway for 2KB metabolism, we repeated these experiments in cells transfected with siRNA against <italic>BCKDHA</italic>, <italic>PCCA</italic>, and <italic>HPRT</italic> as an off-target control, or non-targeting siRNA control (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">SFig.3B</xref>).

Addition of 500 μM 2KB increased maximum OCR as before, however, this was inhibited in cells transfected with siRNA against <italic>PCCA</italic> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig.3C</xref>).

<title>2HB is slowly metabolized by LDH</title>
<p>The poor suitability of 2HB as a fuel relative to 2KB suggests slow conversion to 2KB. Interconversion between 2HB and 2KB is proposed to occur via LDH. Thus, we aimed to quantify the relative rate of 2HB oxidation and 2KB reduction. We conducted activity assays using LDH isolated from bovine skeletal muscle or bovine heart. The former is enriched for LDH isoenzymes with M subunits from <italic>LDHA</italic> expression, while the latter is enriched for LDH isoenzymes with H subunits due to predominant <italic>LDHB</italic> expression. As previously reported, 2KB was an efficient substrate for both LDH enzymes, with a maximum relative reaction rate greater than pyruvate (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig.3D</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>. However, 2HB exhibited a maximum reaction rate that was only ∼30% that of lactate using bovine heart LDH, and ∼15% of lactate using bovine skeletal muscle LDH (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig.3D</xref>). These data support a mechanism for the efficient production of 2HB from 2KB, leading to long-lasting 2HB accumulation post-exercise.</p>
<p>Further, we found very low reaction rates for reduction of the BCKA, with a rate between ∼2- 10% the reaction rate of pyruvate. The greatest reaction rate observed was for the keto acid of valine, 2-oxo-3-methylbutyrate, using bovine heart LDH (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">SFig.3C</xref>). No signal was detected above background for the oxidation reaction of any BCHA. These data would be consistent with the relatively low abundance of BCHA, and their slow rate of clearance.</p>

<title>2HB metabolic feedback occurs via BCAT inhibition</title>
<p>The slow metabolic processing of 2HB makes it likely to accumulate in cells and trigger a functional response. Based on the effects of 2HB treatment on BCAA, BCKA, and BCHA levels post- exercise (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig.2</xref>), we hypothesized that 2HB provides metabolic feedback to the BCAA degradation pathway (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig.3E</xref>). As an initial test, we found that culturing C2C12 myoblasts with 500 μM of 2HB increased gene expression of multiple factors involved in BCAA degradation, including those involved in 2KB oxidation such as <italic>BCKDHA</italic>, and <italic>PCCA</italic> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig.3F</xref>).</p>
<p>Based on the structural similarities between 2HB and 2HG, we hypothesized that 2HB may act as a competitive inhibitor of BCAT enzymes. To test this possibility, we conducted activity assays of recombinant human BCAT2 (rhBCAT2) using leucine as a constant substrate and αKG as a varied concentration substrate. In these assays we find a dose dependent reduction to maximal rhBCAT2 activity with increasing concentrations of 2HB in the reaction well (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig.4A</xref>). We conducted similar assays using rhGOT1, an aspartate-oxaloacetate aminotransferase, but found no effect of 2HB on the reaction rate (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">SFig.4A</xref>). Given the modification of BCAT activity, it seemed plausible that 2HB may compete with αKG for active sites in αKGDDs. However, in assays of isolated HIFP4H1 and HIFP4H2, no more than 5% inhibition was observed for concentrations of 2HB up to 10 mM, and similarly little inhibition was observed for assays of isolated KDM6A (<xref rid="tbls1" ref-type="table">STable.1</xref>). These data indicate that 2HB inhibits specifically BCAT activity.</p>

<p>Inhibition of BCAT enzymes may induce a range of metabolic disruptions. To broadly investigate cellular response to acute exogenous 2HB, we quantified cellular NAD+/NADH ratio after addition of 500 μM 2HB to culture media. In C2C12 lysates harvested 60 minutes following addition of 2HB we found an increase to the NAD+/NADH ratio, indicating a drop in the cellular reducing potential (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig.4B</xref>). If cells were harvested after overnight culture, NAD+/NADH ratio had rebounded. There was no effect of treating cells with 2KB, indicating that this metabolic response was specific to 2HB. These findings were replicated in MEFs (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig.4B</xref>). To determine if the NAD+/NADH shift induced by 2HB exposure was dependent upon BCAT expression, we transfected C2C12 cells with a vector driving constitutive expression of DDK-tagged hBCAT2, or empty vector control. The increase to NAD+/NADH could be replicated in vector control cells, but the NAD+/NADH ratio in hBCAT2- transfected cells was insensitive to 2HB addition (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig.4C</xref>, <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">SFig.4B</xref>).

<title>2HB treatment stimulates SIRT4 ADP ribosyltransferase activity</title>
<p>Increases to cellular NAD+ are sensed by Sirtuins, a family of deacetylase enzymes that modify cellular metabolism. Sirtuin 4 (SIRT4) is localised to the mitochondria and is previously described to induce increased expression and post-translational activation of the BCAA degradation pathway<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>. We hypothesized that SIRT4 would be stimulated by the acute shift in NAD+ induced by exogenous 2HB, and that SIRT4 may drive the cellular response to 2HB. First, we transfected MEFs and C2C12 myoblasts with siRNA against SIRT4 and checked for transcriptional induction of BCAA degradation pathway genes following overnight culture in media supplemented with 500 μM 2HB or NaCl control (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">SFig.4C</xref>). We found induction of genes including <italic>BCAT2</italic>, <italic>BCKDHA</italic>, <italic>BCKDHB</italic>, <italic>PCCA</italic>, <italic>SLC7A5</italic>, as well as <italic>LDHB</italic> and <italic>LDHA</italic> in both MEFs and C2C12s treated with 2HB compared with controls. Transfection with siRNA against SIRT4 disrupted the induction of these genes when cells were treated with 2HB (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig.4D</xref>). These data indicate that expression of SIRT4 is critical for the transcriptional feedback induced by 2HB treatment.</p>
<p>SIRT4 is perhaps better characterized as an ADP ribosyl transferase than as a deacetylase<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>. Addition of ADPr to protein requires consumption of local NAD+. Replacing the consumed NAD+ can cause a compartmental shift in the supply of NAD+, and therefore the source of protein ADPr<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>. Thus, metabolic activity in one compartment may induce transcriptional change via regulating ADPr of transcription factors within the nucleus. To investigate the ability of SIRT4 to regulate compartmental ADPr, we separated cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts of C2C12 myoblasts transfected with siRNA against <italic>SIRT4</italic>, or non-targeting control, treated with 500 μM 2HB or NaCl control for 16 hours. In western blots detecting total poly/mono-ADPr, we see that 2HB treatment increases ADPr in the cytoplasmic compartment, while reducing ADPr in the nuclear extracts, each dependent upon SIRT4 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig.4E</xref>, <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">SFig.4D</xref>). We were next interested in whether 2HB-induced SIRT4 activity might alter the ADPr of a transcription factor relevant to regulation of metabolism. C/EBPβ has been described to regulate adipogenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>, which is also known to involve SIRT4-dependent regulation of BCAA metabolism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>. Importantly, C/EBPβ transcriptional activity was shown to be dependent upon compartmental ADPr, wherein C/EBPβ ADPr reduces its transcriptional activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>. Therefore, we conducted immunoprecipitation experiments pulling down total poly/mono-ADPr protein from C2C12 nuclear extracts and blotting for C/EBPβ, or vice versa. We observed a strong effect of SIRT4 knockdown leading to increased ADPr of C/EBPβ, and a trend towards reduced C/EBPβ ADPr in cells treated with 500 μM 2HB for 8 hours (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig.4F</xref>). It is possible that a small shift in ADPr may lead to significant changes to C/EBPβ transcriptional activity. We therefore continued by conducting chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments pulling down C/EBPβ and conducted qPCR for different promoter regions in the genes of <italic>BCKDHA</italic> and <italic>PCCA</italic> containing C/EBPβ consensus binding sites. We found that treating cells with 500 μM 2HB for 8 hours stimulated binding of C/EBPβ to both gene promoters (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig.4G,H</xref>). In summary, we find that treating cells with exogenous 2HB induces a metabolic response via BCAT inhibition, which stimulates SIRT4 to trigger a compartmental change in protein ADPr, leading to C/EBPβ binding to <italic>BCKDHA</italic> and <italic>PCCA</italic> genes (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig.4I</xref>). These data present a mechanism for feedback on the BCAA degradation pathway induced by 2HB accumulation.</p>

Overnight treatment with either 2HB increased both the basal and maximal OCR in MEFs and C2C12s (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig.5A,B</xref>).

To address this possibility, we transfected C2C12s and MEFs with siRNA against SIRT4, BCKDHA, or non-targeting control. Cells were then cultured overnight in media supplemented with 500 μM Na2HB or NaCl, then subjected to a mitochondrial stress test. As before, both MEFs and C2C12s treated with 2HB exhibited an increased basal and maximal OCR (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig.5C,D</xref>). Transfection with siRNA against SIRT4 reduced both basal and maximal OCR and abolished the effect of 2HB (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig.5C,D</xref>). Transfection with siRNA against BCKDHA induced a less drastic reduction to basal and maximal OCR, but also showed no response to 2HB treatment (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig.5C,D</xref>).

<title>2HB-induced increase to oxidative capacity is maintained with chronic treatment</title>
<p>We were interested in whether the increase to cellular OCR would be maintained with chronic treatment. MEFs and C2C12s were treated with fresh media containing 500 μM of Na2HB or NaCl control daily for three days and assays run on the fourth day. We found chronic treatment with 2HB to result in increased maximum OCR in seahorse assays, to a similar effect size as overnight treatment (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">SFig.5B</xref>). We were interested if other mechanisms could be at play with chronic 2HB treatment. 2HB has been reported to promote cervical tumour cell survival via stimulation of the methyltransferase DOT1L<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>. We therefore investigated the potential for epigenetic regulation as a mechanism to explain the observed change in cellular oxidative capacity. However, we found no change to H3K79me3 signal in isolated histones after three days of 2HB treatment (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">SFig.5C,D</xref>). Neither C2C12s or MEFs exhibited any change to H3K27me3, H3K9me2, or H3K4me3, also suggesting no significant regulation of KDMs from three days of 2HB treatment (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">SFig.5C,D</xref>). Finally, we found no change to the expression levels of respiratory chain protein complexes I-V using an OXPHOS antibody cocktail (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">SFig.5E,F</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>2HB has to date been described as a waste product that is released into the circulation during periods of metabolic or oxidative stress, for example, in acute infection, or post-exercise<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>. Here we describe an axis of cellular responses to increased levels of 2HB which regulate the BCAA degradation pathway. We find that exogenous 2HB treatment can recapitulate the effects of short- term exercise training in mice, via improving the fatigue resistance of oxidative skeletal muscle. These data provide insight into novel mechanisms involved in physiological changes to metabolism during exercise training.</p>
<p>The accumulation of 2HB is dependent upon the metabolic balance of 2KB. We demonstrate that 2KB is a suitable fuel for mitochondrial oxidation, dependent upon an intact BCAA degradation pathway (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig.3</xref>). We found that PCC was required for 2KB oxidation, while the BCKDH complex was dispensable. This is in line with data showing that pyruvate dehydrogenase may also oxidize 2KB, although this too has been shown to be dispensable<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>. Alternatively, 2KB may be reduced by LDH to 2HB. The relative balance of oxidation versus reduction likely depends on cellular demand for NADH, oxygen availability, and capacity within the BCAA degradation pathway<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>We find that 2HB is a poor substrate for LDH oxidation, supporting the well-described accumulation of 2HB post-exercise, with a slow return to homeostatic levels (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>,<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. Together, these observations are consistent with the accumulation of 2HB as an indicator of saturated capacity for 2KB oxidation via the BCAA degradation pathway. Interestingly, this pattern is mirrored by the BCHA, 2-hydroxyisocaproate, 2-hydroxy-3-methylvalerate, and 2-hydroxyisovalerate in human plasma metabolomics following exercise (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig.2</xref>). The BCHA are rare metabolites, which is consistent with our observation of very low relative reaction rates for the reduction of BCKA by LDH (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">SFig.3</xref>). Further, we were unable to observe significant oxidation of the BCHA in isolated LDH assays (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">SFig.3</xref>), which is consistent with the pattern of accumulation without return to baseline for all the hydroxy acids (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig.2</xref>). Thus, we propose that the reduction of 2KB and BCKA indicate oversaturation of the BCAA degradation pathway, leading to the LDH-dependent production of 2HB or BCHA that are metabolically stubborn and tend to accumulate.</p>
<p>It is reported that the liver is the major producer of circulating 2HB<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>, which would suggest that many tissues receive external 2HB, and that therefore the balance of 2HB metabolism will depend upon 2HB oxidation. LDH isolated from bovine heart had a greater capacity for oxidation of 2HB than LDH isolated from bovine skeletal muscle (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig.3</xref>), suggesting that <italic>LDHB</italic> gene expression may provide an advantage when metabolising exogenous 2HB. Skeletal muscle expression of <italic>LDHB</italic> was previously reported to be induced by exercise training, and to be dependent upon peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator 1α (PGC-1α), and that <italic>LDHB</italic> expression was required for generating an exercise training benefit<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>. Together, this would suggest that improved capacity for metabolising 2HB is common to the progression of endurance training. Since we observed no induction to PGC-1α gene expression or mitochondrial biogenesis (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">SFig.5</xref>,<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>), treatment with exogenous 2HB does not appear to replicate all exercise training responses in oxidative skeletal muscle. It is possible that 2HB-induced effects on BCAA metabolism occur in an early stage of skeletal muscle endurance training, and that additional signals are required to continue training progression.</p>
<p>We found that the <italic>in vitro</italic> improvement to oxidative capacity induced by 2HB was dependent upon expression of BCKDHA and SIRT4 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig.5</xref>). SIRT4 has been previously reported to produce greater expression and activation of BCAA degradation pathway members <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>, along with C/EBPβ<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>, making this a logical signaling axis for 2HB response. Increased flux in the BCAA degradation pathway is reflected by a reduced proportion of BCKDHA phosphorylation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>, which we observe in the soleus of 2HB-treated mice post-exercise (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig.6</xref>). BCKDHA phosphorylation by BCKDH kinase is inhibited by BCKA. Thus, the reduced BCKDHA phosphorylation is consistent with the increase to BCKA observed in oxidative red gastrocnemius muscle (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig.2</xref>, <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">SFig.2</xref>). That we observe reduced levels of muscular BCHA despite the increase to BCKA levels, without an increase in release of BCKA to the serum, suggests an increase to the oxidative muscle capacity for BCKA oxidation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig.2</xref>).</p>
<p>Together, these data form a logical feedback loop where accumulation of 2HB provides negative feedback to reduce BCAA degradation at the stage of BCAT. Acutely, this would reduce competition for 2KB in the BCAA degradation pathway by slowing conversion of BCAA to keto acids. A sufficiently large acute dose of 2HB may limit mitochondrial fuel by inhibiting BCAT. This model is consistent with the observed rapid increase to NAD+/NADH ratio in MEFs and C2C12s treated with 2HB in culture (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig.4</xref>). We show that this metabolic effect will lead to transcriptional feedback; an increase BCAA and 2KB oxidation capacity will in the long-term reduce the production of 2HB and BCHA, as observed in red gastrocnemius post-exercise in 2HB-treated mice (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig.2</xref>, <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">SFig.2</xref>). That we observe similar transcriptional regulation, changes to BCKDHA phosphorylation, and changes to oxidative metabolism phenotypes <italic>in vivo</italic> suggests that a similar mechanism is occurring in response to intraperitoneal injections of 2HB. In the case of exercise, the physiological accumulation of 2HB would occur during high metabolic demand when mitochondrial fuel supply may be sensitive to the 2HB despite a potentially lower concentration than the exogenous doses used in this study. This is supported by the lack of additive effect on mouse ΔVO<sub>2</sub>max when exogenous 2HB treatment was combined with exercise training (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.1</xref>).</p>
<p>Overall, this study presents an axis of cellular response to 2HB and presents a functional response to repeated 2HB treatment in the form of improved exercise performance and resistance to fatigue in oxidative murine skeletal muscle. Further work investigating cellular responses to accumulated 2HB are warranted as this metabolite accumulates in the circulation of individuals with infection and metabolic disorders<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>.</p>

<p>Male C57/Bl6 mice were purchased from Janvier Labs and housed at Karolinska Institutet under specific pathogen-free conditions. All experiments and protocols were approved by the regional ethics committee of Northern Stockholm. Six-week-old mice were housed for two weeks prior to any experimental procedures to acclimate to the new housing. At experimental endpoint mice were terminated by carbon dioxide. Blood was collected via cardiac puncture and spun in tabletop centrifuge to remove coagulated components, yielding serum. Collected tissue was snap- frozen in liquid nitrogen.</p>

<title>Incremental exercise protocols</title>
<p>An enclosed chamber treadmill (Columbus Instruments) set at 10° incline was used for all exercise and respiration measurements. Eight-week-old mice were acclimated to the treadmill progressively over four days in a standardized protocol across all mice:
<disp-quote><p>Day 1: mice are placed on stationary treadmill for 5 min. Starting at 6 m/min for 3 minutes, speed is increased 3 m/min every 3 minutes. Completed after 3 minutes at 12 m/min.</p></disp-quote>

</p>
<p>Acclimation was completed at least 48 hours prior to any incremental exercise tests concurrent with measurements of O<sub>2</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub> respiration. Incremental exercise tests began with a five-minute settling period, three minutes of measurement with the treadmill at rest, followed by an initial treadmill speed of 6 m/min, after which the speed was increased by 3 m/min every three minutes. Exercise and measurements of oxygen consumption continued until mouse exhaustion, defined as when the mouse refused to run after ten continuous seconds in contact with an electrical grid providing a 1.22 mAmp stimulus at a rate of 2 Hz. <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref> exercise held the treadmill at 18 m/min for 30 minutes instead of continuing until exhaustion. Oxygen and carbon dioxide was monitored using a carbon dioxide and paramagnetic oxygen sensor within an OxyMax system (Columbus Instruments). Measurements were collected every 15 seconds. Basal VO<sub>2</sub> measured while the treadmill was at rest was used to calculate the change to VO<sub>2</sub> (ΔVO<sub>2</sub>) throughout the exercise protocol. ΔVO<sub>2</sub>max was defined as the maximum increase to VO<sub>2</sub> above baseline achieved during the incremental exercise protocol.</p>

<title>Skeletal muscle <italic>ex vivo</italic> contractile function and fatigue</title>
<p>Skeletal muscle was prepared and assessed as described previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup>. Briefly, the soleus and EDL muscle were excised under dissection microscope from the right hindlimb with proximal and distal tendons kept intact. Excess adipose tissue was manually cleaned from the muscles and tendons were tied with a braided silk thread and mounted in a 15 mL stimulation chamber between a force transducer and an adjustable holder (World Precision Instruments). Muscles were submerged in a Tyrode solution containing (in mmol/L): 121 NaCl, 5 KCl, 1.8 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.1 EDTA, 0.5 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.4 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 5.5 glucose, and 24 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>. The force stimulation chamber was set to 31°C and gassed with 95% O<sub>2</sub> 5% CO<sub>2</sub> for a pH of 7.4. Each mounted muscle was adjusted to the length at which the highest twitch force was recorded and then allowed to rest for 15 minutes. The force frequency relationship was determined through stimulations at the following frequencies: 1 (twitch), 10, 15, 20, 30, 50, 70, 100, and 120 Hz for soleus, and 1, 20, 30, 40, 50, 70, 100, 120, and 150 Hz for EDL. The stimuli were interspaced by one minute of rest. Upon completion, the muscle was allowed to rest for seven minutes before starting a fatigue protocol consisting of 100 stimulations (70 Hz, 600 msec train duration, 2 sec interval duration) for the soleus or 50 stimulation (100 Hz, 300 msec train duration, 2 sec interval duration) for the EDL. Muscle recovery was determined at 1, 2, 5, and 10 minutes after the final tetanic stimulation at the same stimulation frequency. Absolute force was expressed in millinewton (mN). Specific force (kN/m<sup>2</sup>) was calculated by dividing the absolute force by the muscle cross sectional area, the latter determined by dividing the muscle mass (with tendons removed) by muscle length and density, assuming a density of 1.06 g/cm<sup>3</sup>.</p>

<p>The work by Johnson and co-workers has identified an <bold>important</bold> role of 2-Hydroxybutyrate in skeletal muscle oxidative capacity in the early stages of exercise.

<p>The authors aimed to investigate if 2-hydroxybutyrate (2HB), a metabolite induced by exercise, influences physiological changes, particularly metabolic alterations post-exercise training. They treated young mice and cultured myoblasts with 2HB, conducted exercise tests, metabolomic profiling, gene expression analysis, and knockdown experiments to understand 2HB's mechanisms. Their findings indicate that 2HB enhances exercise tolerance, boosts branch chain amino acid (BCAA) enzyme gene expression in skeletal muscles, and increases oxidative capacity. They also highlight the role of SIRT4 in these effects. This study establishes 2HB, once considered a waste product, as a regulator of exercise-induced metabolic processes. The study's strength lies in its consistent results across in vitro, in vivo, and ex vivo analyses. The authors propose a mechanism in which 2HB inhibits BCAA breakdown, raises NAD+/NADH ratio, activates SIRT4, increases ADP ribosylation, and controls gene expression.</p>
<p>However, some questions remain unclear based on these findings:</p>
<p>This study focused on the effects of short-term exercise (1 or 5 bouts of treadmill running) and short-term 2HB treatment (1 or 4 days of treatment).

It's important to investigate the effects of long-term 2HB treatment and whether extended combined 2HB treatment and exercise training have independent, synergistic, or antagonistic effects.</p>
<p>Exercise training leads to significant mitochondrial changes, including increased mitochondrial biogenesis in skeletal muscle. It would be valuable to compare the impact of 2HB treatment on mitochondrial content and oxidative capacity in treated mice to that in exercised mice.</p>
<p>The authors demonstrate that 2-ketobutyrate (2KB) can serve as an oxidative fuel, suggesting a role for the intact BCAA catabolic pathway.

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
The manuscript entitled &quot;A 2-HB-mediated feedback loop regulates muscular fatigue&quot; by the Johnson group reports interesting findings with implications for the health benefits of exercise. The authors use a combination of metabolic/biochemical in vivo and in vitro assays to delineate a metabolic route triggered by 2-HB (a relatively stable metabolite induced by exercise in humans and mice) that controls branched-chain amino transferase enzymes and mitochondrial oxidative capacity. Mechanistically, the author shows that 2-HB is a direct inhibitor of BCAT enzymes that in turn control levels of SIRT4 activity and ADp-ribosylation in the nucleus targeting C/EBP transcription factor, affecting BCAA oxidation genes (see Fig 4i in the paper). Overall, these are interesting and novel observations and findings with relevance to human exercise, with the potential implication of using these metabolites to mimic exercise benefits, or conditions or muscular fatigue that occurs in different human chronic diseases including rheumatic diseases or long COVID.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
There are several experiments/comments that will strengthen the manuscript-</p>
<p>1- A final model in Figure 6 integrating the exercise/mechanistic findings, expanding on Fig 4i) will clarify the findings.</p>
<p>2- In some of the graphs, statistics are missing (e.g Fig 6G).</p>
<p>3- The conclusions on SIRT4 dependency should be carefully written, as it is likely that this is only one potential mechanism, further validation with mouse models would be necessary.</p>
<p>4- One of the needed experiments to support the oxidative capacity effects that could be done in cultured cells, is the use of radiosotope metabolites including BCCAs to determine the ability to produce CO2. Alternatively or in combination metabolite flux using isotopes would be useful to strengthen the current results.</p>

<p>The authors aimed to investigate if 2-hydroxybutyrate (2HB), a metabolite induced by exercise, influences physiological changes, particularly metabolic alterations post-exercise training. They treated young mice and cultured myoblasts with 2HB, conducted exercise tests, metabolomic profiling, gene expression analysis, and knockdown experiments to understand 2HB's mechanisms.

They also highlight the role of SIRT4 in these effects. This study establishes 2HB, once considered a waste product, as a regulator of exercise-induced metabolic processes. The study's strength lies in its consistent results across in vitro, in vivo, and ex vivo analyses.</p>
<p>The authors propose a mechanism in which 2HB inhibits BCAA breakdown, raises NAD+/NADH ratio, activates SIRT4, increases ADP ribosylation, and controls gene expression.</p>
<p>However, some questions remain unclear based on these findings:</p>
<p>This study focused on the effects of short-term exercise (1 or 5 bouts of treadmill running) and short-term 2HB treatment (1 or 4 days of treatment). Adaptations to exercise training typically occur progressively over an extended period. It's important to investigate the effects of long-term 2HB treatment and whether extended combined 2HB treatment and exercise training have independent, synergistic, or antagonistic effects.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the reviewer that investigation of longer-term 2HB treatment may potentially yield interesting findings with more implications to exercise physiology. To investigate the effects of 2HB treatment against or in combination with a progressive exercise training protocol would require an experiment duration between 4 to 12 weeks, based on previous studies (Systematic Review by Massett et al., Frontiers in Physiology, 2021, 10.3389/fphys.2021.782695). However, our experience with these types of experiments is that such a pursuit would require a breadth of work beyond the scope of this current study. For instance, if there were evidence of weakened effect of 2HB over time, one may be compelled to investigate other organs such as the liver to find signs of metabolic adaptation to the exogenous metabolite. If there were additive or synergistic effects on exercise performance, one may be compelled to investigate changes to the cardiovascular system in addition to the skeletal muscle. Additional questions would be raised around the skeletal muscle as well, including assessment of structural and fibre-type changes. Further, these additional mechanisms would need to be characterized in a time course fashion. Rather, we view the scope of the current study to be the acute response to 2HB as an initial report on mechanistic effects of 2HB.</p>

<p>Exercise training leads to significant mitochondrial changes, including increased mitochondrial biogenesis in skeletal muscle. It would be valuable to compare the impact of 2HB treatment on mitochondrial content and oxidative capacity in treated mice to that in exercised mice.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the author that it is of interest to investigate how 2HB may affect mitochondrial biogenesis. However, our preliminary findings were that 2HB-treated MEFs, C2C12s, and mouse soleus muscles showed no change in PGC1α gene expression after four days of treatment (data not shown). As a follow-up assessment of mitochondrial protein expression, although not specific to mtDNA derived genes, we quantified the expression of the respiratory chain proteins in cells and soleus muscle and found no effect of 2HB treatment (SFig. 5,6). At this stage we conclude that there is not evidence of 2HB modifying mitochondrial biogenesis in this time frame and that further investigation would be best suited to a follow-up study such as one interested in long-term exercise training.</p>

<p>The authors demonstrate that 2-ketobutyrate (2KB) can serve as an oxidative fuel, suggesting a role for the intact BCAA catabolic pathway. However, it's puzzling that the knockout of BCKDHA, a subunit crucial for the second step of BCAA catabolism, did not result in changes in oxidative capacity in cultured myoblasts.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>While we report the BCKDH complex to be dispensable for 2KB oxidation it is important to note that previous studies have reported the following: (1) that 2KB is a viable substrate for BCKDH, (2) that 2KB is a viable substrate for pyruvate dehydrogenase, and (3) that pyruvate dehydrogenase is also dispensable for 2KB oxidation (see Steele et al., J Nutr., 114: 701-710, and Paxton et al. Biochem J., 234:295-303). Collectively, these data have led previous studies to conclude that BCKDH and pyruvate dehydrogenase are redundant for the first step of 2KB oxidation, with a preference for BCKDH. The flux through either may depend upon the metabolic environment. The aim for figure 3C was to determine whether the BCAA degradation pathway was required for 2KB oxidation. We conclude that this pathway is required, first at the step of PCC.</p>
<p>While these past studies were mentioned in paragraph 2 of the discussion, in light of the
reviewer’s comment we have expanded this paragraph. We have added language to explain that future research interested in the presented 2HB mechanism should carefully consider BCKDH and PDH expression in the cell or tissue of interest, as the metabolism of 2KB is quite central to the presented mechanism.</p>

<p>(1) A final model in Figure 6 integrating the exercise/mechanistic findings, expanding on Fig 4i) will clarify the findings.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the reviewer’s suggestion to incorporate the exercise findings into a summary figure. However, upon internal review we find that such a figure is too similar to Fig 4i to warrant a new diagram.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) In some of the graphs, statistics are missing (e.g Fig 6G).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Some figures are included primarily for the reader to visualize the data while statistical comparison is conducted in a separate figure, for example Fig 2D-G. However, we have revised the figure legends to ensure that statistical comparisons are described for all appropriate figures, including Fig 6G identified by the reviewer.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) The conclusions on SIRT4 dependency should be carefully written, as it is likely that this is only one potential mechanism, further validation with mouse models would be necessary.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the reviewers feedback and take the point well that a NAD-dependent mechanism will likely stimulate other sirtuins, which are often in fact expressed at greater levels than SIRT4. To reflect this comment in the manuscript we have altered paragraph 5 of the discussion to now focus on sirtuins. We briefly discuss SIRT4 and highlight the need for future consideration of other sirtuins, perhaps particularly mitochondrial sirtuins.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">

<p>We appreciate the suggestion from the reviewer and we will look to conduct such an experiment in our follow-up work.</p>
<p>We sincerely thank the reviewers for their input on this study as their suggestions have led to an improved manuscript for the version of record. The reviewer comments are well taken and we are glad that they will be present alongside the final manuscript to provide an important perspective on the work.</p>
