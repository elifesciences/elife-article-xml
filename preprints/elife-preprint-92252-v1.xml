<title>Introduction</title>
<p>General anesthesia is a cornerstone of modern medical sciences. Upon the use of anesthetics, patients lose consciousness and enter an unarousable state. Although general anesthetics are widely used in clinical procedures, the mechanism of general anesthesia remains elusive. Different anesthetics activate or inhibit specific receptors in neurons, modulating neuronal activities across the entire network. However, the involvement of nonelectrically active glial cells in anesthesia is poorly understood. Microglia are yolk sac-derived glial cells in the central nervous system (CNS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>). They play critical roles in CNS development, function and dysfunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>). Previous studies have found that neuronal activity in the CNS network modulates microglial activity. Microglia exhibit elevated process motility, extension and territory surveillance during anesthetization and sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>). Suppression of neuronal activity increases calcium signaling in microglial processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>). Conversely, microglia also modulate neuronal activity via multiple mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>). The microglial regulation of neuronal activities thus raises the question of whether microglia can modulate the general anesthesia response.</p>
<p>Microglial survival relies on colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R) signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>). Pharmacological inhibition of CSF1R efficiently eliminates CNS microglia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>). Previous studies have shown that acute microglial depletion does not induce neuroinflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>). The ablation of microglia in adulthood also does not result in obvious general behavioral dysfunctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>), although this finding is controversial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>). It seems that microglia are disposable under physiological conditions. However, when we killed microglia with PLX5622, a CSF1R inhibitor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>), we unintentionally observed robust resistance to anesthetic administration. This suggests that microglia may facilitate general anesthesia by modulating neuronal network activity.</p>
<p>To this end, we first quantified the influence of microglial depletion on the response to general anesthesia. We utilized the loss of righting reflex (LORR) and recovery of righting reflex (RORR) to evaluate anesthesia induction and emergence, respectively. After microglial depletion, mice displayed a longer LORR time and a shorter RORR time. The dampened general anesthesia response was not dependent on specific anesthetics or receptors, as this phenomenon was observed with three different agonists of the GAGA<sub>A</sub> receptor (pentobarbital, propofol and chloral hydrate) and one antagonist of the NMDA receptor (ketamine). Electroencephalography (EEG) and electromyography (EMG) findings further confirmed our initial observation. Different brain regions diversely regulate anesthesia induction and emergence. Anesthesia induction is positively correlated with anesthesia-activated brain regions (AABRs). In contrast, anesthesia emergence is positively correlated with emergence-activated brain regions (EABRs). We observed that microglia modulate brain network activity in a brain region-specific manner rather than in a universal manner for all brain regions. Based on c-Fos reactivity and patch clamp recordings, we demonstrated that microglial depletion inhibits AABRs and activates EABRs. The divergent effects in different brain regions orchestrate the status during general anesthesia use. Microglia-mediated anesthesia modulation is not attributed to dendritic spine plasticity. We found that mice with genetical knockout or pharmacological inhibition of microglial P2Y12 were more resistant to general anesthesia. In addition, the contribution of microglial P2Y12 to anesthesia response was further confirmed by the mice received microglia replacement, in which the replaced microglia-like cells are P2Y12<sup>−</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>). On the other hand, the intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration in microglia facilitates and stabilizes the response to general anesthesia. Because purinergic activation of P2Y12 increases intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>), our results reveal that the general anesthesia response is regulated through P2Y12 to Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling in microglia.</p>
<p>In conclusion, our study demonstrates a regulatory role of microglia in the response to general anesthesia and identifies the underlying mechanism of this process. This study extends our knowledge of how nonelectrically active glial cells regulate the general anesthesia response. It also sheds new light on how microglia contribute to maintaining the status of the brain network. When we were preparing our manuscript, a paper discussing a similar topic emerged (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>).</p>

<title>Microglia regulate the induction of and emergence from general anesthesia</title>
<p>We unintentionally observed that mice become more resistant to anesthesia after microglia and macrophage depletion by the CSF1R inhibitor PLX5622. To quantitatively study whether microglial depletion indeed influences the induction of and emergence from general anesthesia, we first fed mice a PLX5622-formulated diet (PLX5622 hereafter) to ablate CNS microglia and peripheral macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>). After 14 days of PLX5622 administration, we intraperitoneally injected pentobarbital (80 mg pentobarbital sodium per kg of body weight) into the PLX5622-treated mice (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). Compared to naïve mice on day 0 (D0), the PLX5622-treated mice at D14 displayed a longer time for LORR and shorter time for RORR (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). Pentobarbital is an agonist of the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>). We next examined whether this microglia- and macrophage-mediated regulation of the anesthesia response is restricted to pentobarbital or GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor agonists. We assessed LORR and RORR in PLX5622-treated mice by using other anesthetics, including two other GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor agonists (propofol, 200 mg/kg of body weight; chloral hydrate, 400 mg/kg of body weight) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>) and one NMDA receptor antagonist (ketamine, 100 mg/kg of body weight) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>). Similar trends were observed in propofol-, chloral hydrate- and ketamine-induced LORR and RORR (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). To exclude the possibility that PLX5622-induced anesthesia resistance results from tolerance to repetitive anesthetic injection, we sequentially treated mice with the same anesthetics 5 times at 7-day intervals (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). Both LORR and RORR were unchanged for pentobarbital, propofol, chloral hydrate and ketamine, except for chloral hydrate-induced LORR after D14 (the third dose) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). PLX5622-treated mice exhibited a resistant phenotype (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). In contrast, the third dose of chloral hydrate made mice more susceptible to anesthesia (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>), an opposite trend from PLX5622 treatment. Consequently, PLX5622-induced anesthesia resistance is not attributed to the tolerance of repetitive anesthetic administration.</p>

<p>PLX5622 can simultaneously ablate brain microglia and peripheral macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>). To exclude the possibility that CSF1R-mediated general anesthesia regulation does not result from peripheral macrophages, we utilized the blood-brain barrier-impermeable CSF1R inhibitor PLX73086 to ablate peripheral macrophages without influencing brain microglia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>). After administration of the PLX73086-formulated diet (PLX73086 hereafter) for 14 days, macrophages in the liver, lung, spleen and kidney were significantly ablated, while brain microglia were not influenced (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A-B</xref>). PLX73086-treated mice (peripheral macrophage-depleted, brain microglia-unchanged) displayed similar general anesthetic responses as CD-treated naïve mice, including those treated with pentobarbital, propofol, chloral hydrate and ketamine, except for the RORR in pentobarbital-treated mice (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>). Since PLX73086-treated mice (peripheral macrophage-depleted, brain microglia-unchanged) exhibited a delayed RORR with pentobarbital administration (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>), whereas PLX5622-treated mice (peripheral macrophage-depleted, brain microglia-depleted) displayed an earlier RORR (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>), the pentobarbital-induced early emergence in PLX5622-administered mice is not attributed to peripheral macrophage ablation. Therefore, microglial depletion, rather than macrophage depletion, leads to resistance to general anesthesia.</p>

<graphic xlink:href="561235v1_fig3.tif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/>
</fig>
<p>Next, we reasoned whether this anesthesia resistance is permanent or can be reversed by microglial repopulation. To address this question, we ceased CSF1R inhibition by treating the microglia-depleted mice with a control diet (CD) for 21 days to allow microglia to repopulate the brain (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>), at which point repopulated microglia recovered to the same density and similar transcriptional characteristics as those in control mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>). The LORR and RORR of microglia-repopulated mice at D35 recovered to the same level as those of naïve mice at D0 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>), indicating that fully repopulated microglia can reverse the anesthesia susceptibility of mice.</p>
<p>Together, our results indicate that microglial depletion by inhibiting CSF1R results in delayed anesthesia induction and early anesthesia emergence, making the animals more resistant to general anesthesia.</p>
<p>To further characterize the impact of microglial depletion throughout the anesthetization window, we recorded EEG and EMG signals to monitor the anesthesia state before and after pentobarbital administration (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). Microglial depletion showed no obvious influence on the EEG in the awake or conscious state before pentobarbital administration (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>). In contrast, microglia-depleted mice exhibited delayed anesthesia induction and early emergence in response to pentobarbital (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B-C</xref>). In addition, microglial depletion significantly altered the power spectrum during anesthesia induction and emergence but not consciousness (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>). The EMG results showed that muscular activity in the conscious state was unchanged upon microglial depletion. In contrast, microglia-depleted mice exhibited a delayed loss and early recovery of muscular activity after pentobarbital injection (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>). Moreover, the probability of being in the conscious state, predicted by an algorithm combining EEG and EMG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>), triple confirmed delayed anesthesia induction and early emergence after microglial depletion (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>). Similar results were also observed for propofol (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>) and ketamine (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>). The EEG and EMG results demonstrate that microglial depletion impedes the anesthesia process.</p>

<title>Microglia facilitate the anesthesia response in a brain region-specific manner</title>
<p>A previous study indicated that microglia negatively regulate neuronal activity through the microglial catabolism of ATP and neuronal adenosine receptor A<sub>1</sub>R. Microglial depletion enhances neuronal activity in the striatum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>). Different brain regions regulate anesthesia induction and emergence in diverse manners. If microglial depletion indiscriminately influences neuronal activities among different brain regions, the enhanced activities in AABRs and EABRs would be mutually antagonistic, complicating the anesthetic effect. To investigate whether microglia regulate neuronal activity in an indiscriminate or brain region-specific manner, we examined c-Fos expression in AABRs and EABRs of CD- and PLX5622-treated mice (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A</xref>). We first studied AABRs, including the lateral habenula (LHb) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>), supraoptic nucleus (SON) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>), ventrolateral preoptic nucleus (VLPO) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>) and thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>). The abundance of c-Fos<sup>+</sup> cells was significantly reduced in the LHb and SON of microglia-depleted mice (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7B</xref>). VLPO exhibited a decreasing trend in the abundance of c-Fos<sup>+</sup> cells, although it did not reach a statistically significant level (P = 0.1592) (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7B</xref>). The abundance of c-Fos<sup>+</sup> cells was unchanged in the TRN (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7B</xref>). We next examined EABRs, including the paraventricular thalamus (PVT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>), locus coeruleus (LC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>), lateral hypothalamus (LH) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>) and ventral tegmental area (VTA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>). In contrast to a suppressed trend in AABRs, neuronal activity exhibited an enhanced trend in EABRs. Microglial depletion significantly increased the c-Fos<sup>+</sup> cell number in the PVT and LC (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7C</xref>). c-Fos<sup>+</sup> cell numbers were also increased in the LH and VTA, although the difference did not reach statistical significance (P = 0.0598 and 0.1436, respectively) (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7C</xref>). To exclude the possibility that the different c-Fos<sup>+</sup> cell numbers were attributed to animal handling, we compared c-Fos expression in saline-injected and noninjected mice (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8A</xref>). Our results indicate that animal handling (saline injection) did not influence c-Fos expression in the LHb, SON, VLPO, TRN, PVT, LC, LH or VTA (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8B-C</xref>). Therefore, we found that microglial depletion negatively regulates AABRs and positively regulates EABRs, indicating that microglia regulate neuronal activity in a brain region-specific manner. The suppressed neuronal activity in AABRs leads to delayed anesthesia induction. In contrast, the elevated neuronal activity in EABRs results in the early emergence of anesthesia.</p>

<p>The protein expression of c-Fos is relatively slow, peaking at a timepoint hours after transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>). Mice in our study were quickly sacrificed after deep anesthesia, typically within 5 to 10 min. The abundance of c-Fos protein seen with immunostaining reflected neuronal activity during the consciousness stage (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>). In contrast, the mRNA expression of <italic>Fos</italic> (encoding c-Fos) is relatively fast, peaking at approximately 30 min after induction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>). We asked how microglia influence neuronal activity during the anesthesia stage and whether microglia differentially influence neuronal activity between the consciousness and anesthesia stages. To this end, we sacrificed microglia-naïve and microglia-depleted mice 30 min after deep anesthetization by pentobarbital and simultaneously labeled the c-Fos protein by immunostaining and <italic>Fos</italic> mRNA by RNAscope (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9A</xref>). The c-Fos<sup>+</sup> cells represent activated neurons during the consciousness stage, while <italic>Fos</italic><sup>+</sup> cells represent activated neurons during the anesthesia stage (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9A</xref>). We compared the c-Fos<sup>+</sup> and <italic>Fos</italic><sup>+</sup> cells in AABRs and EABRs in which neuronal activity was significantly altered in microglia-depleted mice, including the LHb, SON, PVT and LC (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7B-C</xref> and <xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9B-C</xref>). After microglial depletion, activated neurons in the anesthesia stage (<italic>Fos</italic><sup>+</sup>) displayed similar trends as those in the consciousness state (c-Fos<sup>+</sup>) in the LHb, SON and LC (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9B-C</xref>). However, the number of anesthesia-activated neurons (<italic>Fos</italic><sup>+</sup>) was unchanged between the naïve and microglia-depleted PVT, whereas the number of consciousness-activated neurons was significantly increased upon microglial depletion (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9C</xref>). Exploiting the c-Fos protein and <italic>Fos</italic> mRNA dual labeling, we further compared consciousness-activated anesthesia-activated (c-Fos<sup>+</sup> <italic>Fos</italic><sup>+</sup>), consciousness-activated anesthesia-nonactivated (c-Fos<sup>+</sup> <italic>Fos</italic><sup>−</sup>) and consciousness-nonactivated anesthesia-activated (c-Fos<sup>−</sup> <italic>Fos</italic><sup>+</sup>) neurons between naïve and microglia-depleted mice (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9A</xref>). In the LHb and SON of AABRs, consciousness-activated anesthesia-activated (c-Fos<sup>+</sup> <italic>Fos</italic><sup>+</sup>), consciousness-activated anesthesia-nonactivated (c-Fos<sup>+</sup> <italic>Fos</italic><sup>−</sup>) and consciousness-nonactivated anesthesia-activated (c-Fos<sup>−</sup> <italic>Fos</italic><sup>+</sup>) cell numbers exhibited a decreasing trend after microglial depletion (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9B</xref>). This indicates that microglial depletion influences AABR neuronal activity at both the consciousness and anesthesia stages. In the PVT of the EABR, consciousness-activated anesthesia-nonactivated (c-Fos<sup>+</sup> <italic>Fos</italic><sup>−</sup>) cell numbers were significantly increased in microglia-depleted brains, whereas consciousness-activated anesthesia-activated (c-Fos<sup>+</sup> <italic>Fos</italic><sup>+</sup>) and consciousness-nonactivated anesthesia-activated (c-Fos<sup>−</sup> <italic>Fos</italic><sup>+</sup>) cell numbers were unchanged (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9C</xref>). This indicates that microglial depletion influences PVT neuronal activity at the consciousness stage but not at the anesthesia stage. In the LC of the EABR, microglial depletion significantly increased the cell numbers of consciousness-activated anesthesia-activated (c-Fos<sup>+</sup> <italic>Fos</italic><sup>+</sup>) and consciousness-activated anesthesia-nonactivated (c-Fos<sup>+</sup> <italic>Fos</italic><sup>−</sup>) neurons (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9C</xref>). In contrast, the number of consciousness-nonactivated anesthesia-activated (c-Fos<sup>−</sup> <italic>Fos</italic><sup>+</sup>) cells was not altered (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9C</xref>). This finding indicates that microglial depletion does not influence the LC neurons that are not activated in the consciousness stages.</p>

<title>Microglial depletion reduces the E/I ratio in AABR but enhances the E/I ratio in EABR</title>
<p>To understand how microglia reshape neuronal activity, we treated mice with CD or PLX5622 for 14 days and performed whole-cell recordings in neurons of SON and LC in acute brain slices, representing AABR and EABR with reduced and increased neuronal activity upon microglial depletion, respectively (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Figure 10A</xref>). We delivered electrical pulses (0.1 ms in pulse duration, 10/20 Hz, 8 pulses) with a current intensity increment of 10 μA every 10 seconds to the neighboring tissue (approximately 50 μm from the recorded cell) to induce postsynaptic responses, including both evoked excitatory postsynaptic currents (eEPSCs) and evoked inhibitory postsynaptic currents (eIPSCs). In the SON of AABR, higher stimulation currents induced larger amplitudes of both eEPSCs and eIPSCs (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Figure 10B-C</xref>). The peak amplitudes of eEPSCs in microglia-depleted mice were significantly smaller than those in naïve mice, while the peak amplitudes of eIPSCs showed no significant difference (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Figure 10B-C</xref>). As shown in <xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Figure 10C</xref>, the excitation received by SON neurons dominated in naïve mice. The E/I ratio was also significantly decreased after microglial depletion, indicating decreased neuronal excitability in the SON (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Figure 10D</xref>). SON neurons with microglia depletion exhibited a significantly increased paired-pulse ratio (PPR) of eEPSCs, while the eIPSC PPR was similar between naïve and microglia-depleted mice (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Figure 10E</xref>-F), indicating a reduction in presynaptic release probability in excitatory synapses. Microglial depletion thus results in a more inhibitory state in the AABR SON. In the LC of EABR, the eEPSC amplitudes induced by higher stimulation currents in microglia-depleted mice were substantially greater than those in naïve mice (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Figure 10G-H</xref>). In contrast, the eIPSC amplitudes showed no significant difference (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Figure 10G-H</xref>). In contrast to that in the SON, the E/I ratio in the LC was significantly enhanced in PLX5622-treated mice (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Figure 10I</xref>), indicating an increase in the excitation of LC neurons. Microglial depletion did not change the eEPSC PPR or eIPSC PPR in the LC (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Figure 10J-K</xref>), representing an unchanged presynaptic release probability in both excitatory and inhibitory synapses. Microglial depletion thus results in a more excitatory state in the EABR LC.</p>

<title>Microglia-mediated anesthesia modulation is not attributed to the influence of dendritic spines</title>
<p>Microglia play important roles in spine pruning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>). We asked whether microglia-mediated anesthesia regulation occurs through the alteration of dendritic spines. We first quantified spine density after microglial depletion for 14 days (<xref rid="fig11" ref-type="fig">Figure 11A</xref>). Spine density in both apical and basal dendrites of layer V pyramidal cells in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) was not changed in the relatively short period of 14 days (<xref rid="fig11" ref-type="fig">Figure 11B</xref>), when anesthesia induction and emergence were already robustly influenced (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). The ratios of spine categories of different shapes were altered in microglia-depleted mice. In apical dendrites, the percentage of mature mushroom spines was increased, whereas the percentage of filopodia spines was reduced (<xref rid="fig11" ref-type="fig">Figure 11B</xref>). In basal dendrites, mature mushroom spines were increased, while thin and filopodia spines were decreased (<xref rid="fig11" ref-type="fig">Figure 11B</xref>). Thus, short-term microglial depletion for 14 days does not alter spine density but changes the percentage of different categories of spines, even though general anesthesia is dramatically influenced. Next, we ask whether the altered spine density influences general anesthesia response. Microglia phagocytose dendritic spines via the C1q “eat me” signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>). The dendritic spine is remodeled in C1q-dificient mice with increased density (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>).We thus examined anesthesia induction and emergence in C1qa<sup>−/−</sup> mice (<xref rid="fig11" ref-type="fig">Figure 11C</xref>). Even with the alteration of spine density, the pentobarbital-, propofol- or ketamine-induced LORR and RORR were not influenced in C1q-deficient mice (<xref rid="fig11" ref-type="fig">Figure 11D</xref>). Therefore, our results reveal that even though microglia contribute to spine plasticity, microglia-mediated anesthesia modulation does not result from spine pruning.</p>

<title>Intracellular calcium in microglia regulates the anesthesia response through P2Y12 signaling</title>
<p>Microglial P2Y12 is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that modulates neuronal activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>). We thus asked whether microglia-mediated anesthesia modulation is dependent on P2Y12. To address this question, we utilized the selective P2Y12 antagonist 2-MeSAMP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>) to block P2Y12 signaling by intracranial guide tube implantation (<xref rid="fig12" ref-type="fig">Figure 12A</xref>). Ninety minutes after 2-MeSAMP administration, brain microglia exhibited a more reactive morphology (<xref rid="fig12" ref-type="fig">Figure 12B</xref>), the consequence of decreased P2Y12 signaling, as shown in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>). Pharmacological inhibition of P2Y12 by 2-MeSAMP delayed the LORR and accelerated the RORR of pentobarbital-induced anesthetization (<xref rid="fig12" ref-type="fig">Figure 12C</xref>). To further confirm the function of microglial P2Y12 in the anesthesia response, we conditionally knocked out P2Y12 in microglia in CX3CR1<sup>+/CreER</sup>::P2Y12<sup>fl/fl</sup> mice (<xref rid="fig12" ref-type="fig">Figure 12D</xref>). After 4 doses of tamoxifen, the majority of P2Y12 was successfully knocked out in CX3CR1<sup>+/CreER</sup>::P2Y12<sup>fl/fl</sup> mice (<xref rid="fig12" ref-type="fig">Figure 12E</xref>). CX3CR1<sup>+/CreER</sup>::P2Y12<sup>fl/fl</sup> mice exhibited delayed LORR and early RORR in response to pentobarbital (<xref rid="fig12" ref-type="fig">Figure 12F</xref>), echoing the pharmacological inhibition by 2-MeSAMP. Interestingly, when the conditional knockout of microglial P2Y12 was induced at a lower efficacy in TMEM119<sup>CreER/CreER</sup>::P2Y12<sup>fl/fl</sup> mice (<xref rid="fig12" ref-type="fig">Figure 12G-H</xref>), as the recombinase activity of TMEM119-CreER is lower than that of CX3CR1-CreER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>), TMEM119<sup>CreER/CreER</sup>::P2Y12<sup>fl/fl</sup> mice displayed an early RORR in response to pentobarbital, but the LORR was not affected (<xref rid="fig12" ref-type="fig">Figure 12I</xref>).

<title>The influence of microglia replacement to the general anesthesia</title>
<p>In 2020, we first developed efficient strategies for microglia replacement and proposed therapeutic applications for neurological disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>). Microglia replacement by bone marrow transplantation (Mr BMT or mrBMT), one of the replacement strategies, can induce bone marrow cells (BMCs) to differentiate into microglia-like cells and efficiently replace endogenous microglia in the whole CNS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>). Despite sharing similar characteristics to endogenous microglia, the replaced cells are P2Y12<sup>−</sup> (<xref rid="fig13" ref-type="fig">Figure 13A-B</xref>) as we previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>). We thus reasoned that if microglial P2Y12 indeed influences the response to general anesthesia, Mr BMT-treated mice with P2Y12<sup>−</sup> microglia should display a dampened response to anesthetics. To this end, we examined anesthesia induction and emergence in Mr BMT mice (<xref rid="fig13" ref-type="fig">Figure 13A</xref>). We found that Mr BMT mice exhibited delayed LORR and early RORR (<xref rid="fig13" ref-type="fig">Figure 13C</xref>), further echoing the important regulatory role of P2Y12 in the response to general anesthesia.</p>

<title>Microglial intracellular calcium regulates general anesthesia</title>
<p>Purinergic activation of P2Y12 increases intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>). We thus reasoned that the modulation of the anesthesia response is mediated by downstream Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling. To this end, we ectopically expressed a chemogenetic receptor in microglia by CX3CR1<sup>+/CreER</sup>::hM3Dq-YFP<sup>+/–</sup> (<xref rid="fig14" ref-type="fig">Figure 14A-B</xref>). hM3Dq is a modified human M3 muscarinic (hM3) receptor that activates G<sub>αq</sub> upon clozapine-N-oxide (CNO) and in turn enhances its downstream Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>). When we treated CX3CR1<sup>+/CreER</sup>::hM3Dq-YFP<sup>+/–</sup> with CNO to elevate the intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> level in microglia, the LORR to pentobarbital was accelerated, and RORR was delayed (<xref rid="fig14" ref-type="fig">Figure 14C</xref>).

<title>The mutual interaction between microglia and neurons</title>
<p>Previous studies have indicated that microglia exhibit increased process motility, extension and territory surveillance during anesthetization and sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>). However, whether and how microglia regulate neuronal activity and contribute to anesthesia response is largely unknown. Our study demonstrated an active role of microglia in neuronal activity that facilitate and stabilize the anesthesia response by differentially changing neuronal activity in the AABRs and EABRs. It relies on microglial P2Y12 and intracellular calcium, rather than the spines plasticity. Microglia and neurons mutually interact with each other under both physiological and pathological conditions. Previous studies have indicated that neurons can influence the morphology and function of microglia through neurotransmitters and/or neuromodulators, such as GABA and ATP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref>). On the other hand, microglia can regulate neuronal activity. Microglia in the paraventricular nucleus are able to maintain the balance of sympathetic outflow and suppress the pressor response under hypertensive insults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref>). Chemogenetic manipulations of microglia lead to a prostaglandin-dependent reduction in the excitability of striatal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref>). This evidence reveals that although microglia are resident immune cells in the brain, their functions are not limited to the immune response. Our study found that during the process of general anesthesia, microglia serve as an “anesthesia facilitator and stabilizer” through activating AABRs and inhibiting EABRs. As a result, microglia-depleted mice are more resistant to general anesthesia.</p>

<title>Microglial depletion diversely influences neuronal activities in different brain regions</title>
<p>Different nuclei are involved in the response to general anesthesia. The influences of microglial depletion on neuronal activity among these nuclei are different. After microglial ablation, c-Fos expression is decreased in AABRs but increased in EABRs. Meanwhile, the electrophysiology results also show that the E/I ratio is differentially regulated in different brain regions upon microglial depletion. However, the mechanism behind brain region-specific regulation is unclear. Several hypotheses may explain the microglia-mediated diverse regulations among different brain regions. First, it may be due to microglial heterogeneity among brain regions. Nonetheless, recent study indicated that the cross-regional heterogeneity in adulthood was over estimated in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref>). Second, different neuronal cell types may differentially respond to microglial depletion. Taking the adenosine receptor as an example. The adenosine concentration is reduced in the microglia-depleted cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref>). Interference of P2Y12, CD39 or CD73 in microglia disrupts the metabolism of extracellular adenosine in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref>). Our results showed that inhibition or knockout of P2Y12 results in resistance of general anesthesia, indicating that neurons in different brain regions, e.g., the AABRs and EABRs, differentially respond to adenosine. Moreover, adenosine receptor subtypes are discriminately distributed across different brain regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref>), suggesting neurons of different adenosine receptors in the different brain regions may differentially respond to adenosine. Third, the brain region-specific regulation may also rely on the neural circuitry. Mutual innervations of the AABRs-EABRs and local circuities within specific brain region can result in the diverse neuronal response. The regulation of neuronal activity is an overall effect that integrated with multiple variables. So does the microglial contribution to the different brain regions.</p>

<title>Molecular mechanisms of how microglia regulate neuronal activity</title>
<p>The C1q-dependent spine pruning by microglia mediates memory forgetting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref>). With increased number of dendritic spines, C1q-deficient mice display enhanced synaptic connectivity and seizure susceptibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref>). These indicate the importance of C1q in maintaining the neural function. However, we did not observe the alteration of general anesthesia response. Moreover, the spine density was not changed upon the short-term microglial depletion for 14 days. Consequently, our results indicate the microglia-mediated regulation of anesthesia response does not result from dendritic spine. In striatum, microglia serve as a brake suppressing neuronal activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>). P2Y12 knockout in microglia augments the epilepsy susceptible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref>). These evidences indicate that P2Y12 signaling is critical to the stability of neuronal network. However, when we compared neuronal activities by c-Fos staining and patch clamp recording between the AABRs and EABRs, we observed different consequences to the microglial depletion. With suppressed neuronal activity in AABRs and enhanced neuronal activity in EABRs, microglial depletion results in delayed anesthesia induction and early emergence. Our results also indicate that microglia sophisticatedly and diversely contribute to orchestrating the CNS function, rather than play an indiscriminate role of negative feedback control as they do in the striatum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>). Notably, P2Y12 is down regulated in several neurological disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">73</xref>). The consequences of P2Y12 downregulation in neurological disorders are largely unknown. It would be a potential therapeutic target to harness neurological disorders.</p>

<title>Microglia replacement and general anesthesia</title>
<p>In 2020, we first developed three strategies to achieve efficient microglia replacement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>), including Mr BMT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>), microglia replacement by peripheral blood (Mr PB or mrPB) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">74</xref>) and microglia replacement by microglia transplantation (Mr MT or mrMT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">75</xref>). We discussed a potential application for treating Alzheimer’s disease (AD) by replacing microglia deficient in TREM2, which is one of the major risk factors in sporadic AD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">76</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">84</xref>), with TREM2-normal microglia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">85</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">86</xref>). Recent studies verified this therapeutic effect of Mr BMT in an AD mouse model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">87</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">88</xref>), demonstrating the clinical potential of microglia replacement. It also provides new and clinically feasible strategies for treating other neurological disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">85</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">86</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">89</xref>). Despite sharing similar characteristics with naïve microglia, Mr BMT cells are P2Y12<sup>−</sup>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>). Whether P2Y12<sup>−</sup> microglia-like Mr BMT cells influence the response to general anesthesia is unknown. To this end, we tested the response to general anesthesia use in mice treated with Mr BMT and found delayed anesthesia induction and early emergence. This study not only demonstrates the role of P2Y12 signaling in regulating the response to general anesthesia but also identifies an impeded general anesthesia response after Mr BMT treatment.</p>

<title>Optogenetic and chemogenetic manipulations in neuronal and nonneuronal cells</title>
<p>The “activation” and “inhibition” of neurons are defined as the electrical activities (e.g., action potentials) by which neurons convey information and signals. Optogenetics and chemogenetics are powerful tools widely used in manipulating neuronal electrical activity to dissect neural circuitries. Optogenetics relies on light-sensitive ion channels, pumps or enzymes. Channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) is an excitatory optogenetic tool of light-sensitive cation channels from green algae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">90</xref>). Ectopically expressed ChR2 in neurons responds to blue light and undergoes a conformational change, which allows the passive diffusion of Na<sup>+</sup>, Ca<sup>2+</sup>, H<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup>. It thus depolarizes the member potential and elicits action potentials in neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">91</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c92">92</xref>). Halorhodopsin (NpHR) is an inhibitory optogenetic tool of archaeal light-driven chloride pumps. In response to yellow light, the ectopically expressed NpHR in neurons actively pumps Cl<sup>−</sup> into cells and hyperpolarizes the membrane potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93">93</xref>). Chemogenetic tools are based on designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs (DREAADs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>). hM3Dq is an excitatory chemogenetic tool of genetically encoded tetracycline-sensitive G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c94">94</xref>). hM3Dq responds to CNO and activates intracellular G<sub>αq</sub>. Then, the elevated G<sub>αq</sub> level enhances the intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration, thereby inducing action potentials in neurons. hM4Di is an inhibitory chemogenetic tool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c95">95</xref>). hM4Di responds to CNO and engages the G<sub>αi</sub> signaling pathway. G<sub>αi</sub> in neurons reduces intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> (suppressing presynaptic transmitter release) and opens K<sup>+</sup> channels (hyperpolarizing the membrane potential). Thus, the intracellular consequences from optogenetic and chemogenetic manipulations can drive or suppress action potentials in neurons, thus “activating” or “inhibiting” the neuron.</p>
<p>In contrast, the nonelectrically excitable cells, including microglia, have no action potentials. The “activation” (or reactive state) and “inhibition” are not defined as electrical activities. Instead, “activation” (or reactive state) and “inhibition” are defined as responses to specific stimuli in diverse contexts in which nonneuronal cells experience sophisticated alterations. The intracellular events of optogenetic and chemogenetic tools are not directly associated with nonneuronal cell activation. Thus, optogenetic and chemogenetic tools do not simply “activate” or “inhibit” nonneuronal cells in the brain. In our study, we ectopically expressed hM3Dq in microglia. Upon CNO administration, hM3Dq elevates intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels. It does not result in action potentials in microglia and thus does not “activate” microglia. Nonetheless, it is a reliable chemogenetic tool for manipulating the Ca<sup>2+</sup> level in microglia. We used this approach to investigate the biological function of microglial Ca<sup>2+</sup> in the response to general anesthesia. Together, optogenetic and chemogenetic tools do not simply “activate” or “inhibit” nonneuronal cells. Instead, they can be utilized to study the function of nonneuronal cells regarding specific intracellular events.</p>

<title>c-Fos immunostaining and <italic>Fos</italic> RNAscope dual labeling</title>
<p>Mice were fed a CD or PLX5622 for 14 days and placed alone in a quiet environment for 2 h, and samples were taken 30 min after intraperitoneal injection of pentobarbital sodium (80 mg/kg BW). Cryostat sections at 15 μm were collected, and hybridizations were carried out according to the manufacturer’s instructions using RNAscope Multiplex Fluorescent Detection Reagents V2 (Advanced Cell Diagnostics, Cat#: 323110, Lot: 2015636, 2019446). Briefly, sections were dehydrated in sequential incubations with ethanol, followed by 30 min Protease Plus treatment and RNAscope wash buffer wash. Mouse <italic>Fos</italic> probe (Cat#: 316921, Lot: 221048) was incubated for 2 h at 40 °C, followed by three amplification steps.

<title>EEG/EMG surgery and recording</title>
<p>The mice were initially anesthetized by 2% isoflurane and maintained under anesthesia by 1% isoflurane during the surgery. Body temperature was monitored in real time and kept at approximately 37 °C throughout the surgical procedure. For the EEG/EMG recording experiment, two stainless steel screws were placed on the prefrontal cortex (recording site) and cerebellar cortex (reference site) as EEG electrodes, and two other thin stainless-steel wires were inserted into the bilateral neck muscles as EMG electrodes.</p>
<p>Mice were allowed a minimum of 7 days of recovery following surgery. On the day of recording, the mice were acclimated first for 20 min in a recording box, where the temperature was kept at 25 °C, and the mice were allowed to move around freely. All recordings were conducted between 20:00 and 24:00 Signals were amplified (Apollo I, Bio-Signal Technologies, USA) and digitized at a sampling rate of 1000 Hz.</p>

<title>EEG spectra analysis</title>
<p>The raw EEG signals were down sampled to 250 Hz before analysis. The power spectrum was computed using multitaper methods in the MATLAB Chronux toolbox (version 2.1.2, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://chronux.org/">http://chronux.org/</ext-link>), with 4 s data segments and 3-5 tapers (TW = 3, K = 5). To normalize total power and to compare between groups, the power spectra were normalized such that the total area under the spectra was unity (e.g., power spectral density). Power spectral density analysis was performed on the data from the baseline (20 min before injection), induction (slow oscillation appears for the first time and lasts for more than 30 s after injection) and emergence (slow oscillation disappears for the first time and lasts for more than 10 min after deep anesthesia) periods.</p>
<p>The time-frequency power spectrum (by the “cwt” function in the MATLAB wavelet toolbox) was also computed using 80 Hz down sampled EEG to enhance the temporal resolution.</p>

<title>Microglia replacement by bone marrow transplantation (Mr BMT)</title>
<p>Two approaches were used to achieve myeloid ablation/inhibition of Mr BMT in this study. For Mr BMT by irradiation, 8-week-old recipient mice were fed PLX5622 from day 0 to day 14. Then, the pretreated mice were exposed to 9 Gy X-ray irradiation on day 14 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>).

<title>Acute brain slice preparation for patch clamp recording and spine quantification</title>
<p>Parasagittal slices containing the LC, SON and mPFC were obtained from mice aged from postnatal day 60 (P60) to P70. Mice were deeply anesthetized with pentobarbital sodium (80 mg/kg of body weight) before sacrifice by decapitation. The brain was quickly removed and immersed in ice-cold sucrose-based ACSF (10 mM glucose, 213 mM sucrose, 26 mM NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 1.25 mM NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 2.5 mM KCl, 2 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 2 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>). Acute brain slices with a thickness of 300 μm were cut in sucrose-based ACSF by a vibratome (Leica VT 1200S). Afterward, brain slices were immediately transferred to an incubation chamber filled with 95% O<sub>2</sub> and 5% CO<sub>2</sub> equilibrated normal ACSF (25 mM glucose, 126 mM NaCl, 26 mM NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 1.25 mM NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 2.5 mM KCl, 2 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub> and 2 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>) at 34 °C for 45 min. Slices were then transferred to 95% O<sub>2</sub> and 5% CO<sub>2</sub> equilibrated normal ACSF at room temperature before recording. Slices were then transferred to a recording chamber continuously perfused in 95% O<sub>2</sub> and 5% CO<sub>2</sub> equilibrated normal ACSF (approximately 60 mL/h) with the temperature maintained at 34 ± 1 °C. An infrared-differential interference contrast (IR-DIC) microscope (Olympus BX-51WI) was used for visualization of individual neurons.</p>

<title>Patch clamp recording</title>
<p>The intracellular solutions contained 138 mM CsCH<sub>3</sub>SO<sub>3</sub>, 3 mM CsCl, 2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.2 mM EGTA, 10 mM HEPES, 2 mM ATP-Na<sub>2</sub> and 5 mM QX314. The pH was appropriately adjusted to 7.3 by CsOH, and osmolarity was adjusted to 280-290 mOsm. The electrode impedance was approximately 4 to 7 MΩ. When recording the evoked EPSCs (eEPSCs), the membrane potential was held at -70 mV. After eEPSC recording, the same cell was held at 0 mV to record evoked IPSCs (eIPSCs). The locations of SON and LC were identified under an IR-DIC microscope based on their location and cell density. The stimulating electrode was placed deep inside the nucleus and approximately 50 μm from the recorded cell. Membrane voltage and current were sampled at 10-25 kHz and low-pass filtered at 2-10 kHz using the patch clamp amplifier MultiClamp 700B (Molecular Devices, LLC), digitized and sampled by Micro 1401 with Spike2 software (Cambridge Electronic Design) or by Digidata 1440A with pCLAMP 10.2 software (Molecular Devices, LLC).

<title>Biocytin filling and morphological reconstruction</title>
<p>Coronal sections containing the mPFC, SON and LC were recorded using patch clamp under a whole-cell configuration. The electrode was filled with the patch solution with 0.2% biocytin (Life Technologies, B1592). Neurons that maintained a stable membrane potential for at least 20 min were included. Upon cessation of filling, the pipette was slowly pulled out along the direction of recording until a membrane reseal was formed. After a 10 min recovery, the slices were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde overnight at 4 °C, cryoprotected in 30% sucrose solution (for 1 to 3 days) and incubated with AF488 streptavidin (1:1000, Invitrogen, Cat#: S11223, 2390711) in PBS containing 0.3% Triton X-100 (Aladdin, T109026) overnight at 4 °C. To reconstruct the dendritic spines, the coronal sections were resected at 70 μm thickness and coverslipped with the mounting medium Fluoromount-G (Southern Biotechnology Associates). The images were taken using an Olympus FV3000 confocal microscope equipped with a UPLSAPO 60X oil-immersion lens (numerical aperture of 1.5). The 2048 × 2048 pixels frame size was used without zooming. Serial Z-stack images with a step size of 0.7 μm were collected. Dendritic segments located 30 μm away from the soma and 50 μm in length were selected for analysis of spine density and category. For individual cells, 8 to 12 dendritic segments were chosen for analysis. Dendritic length and spines were counted and categorized with ImageJ (NIH). Spines were classified into three subtypes: thin, mushroom, and stubby based on previously described criteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c105">105</xref>). Briefly, thin spines included a head-to-neck diameter ratio less than 1.1 and a length-to-spine head ratio greater than 2.0. Mushroom spines had a head diameter larger than 0.5 mm and a head-to-neck diameter ratio greater than 1.1. Stubby spines had no clear border between the head and the attachment to the shaft. Filopodia had a long thin protrusion but without a clear head shape.</p>

Data are shown as the mean ± SD or mean ± SEM as specifically identified. The two-tailed unpaired t test, paired t test and one-way or two-way repeated measures (RM) ANOVA followed by Bonferroni’s multiple comparisons test were used to assess statistical significance based on GraphPad Prism 9.0 and MATLAB 2020b if necessary. Significance was defined as P &lt; 0.05. The layout of all of the figures was generated by Adobe Illustrator.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This study by He, Liu, and He et al. investigated the fundamental role of microglia in modulating general anesthesia. While microglia have been previously shown to regulate neuronal network activity, their role in the induction of (i.e., LORR) and emergence from (i.e., RORR) anesthesia has only recently been explored. Recently published work by Cao et al. reported that microglia modulate general anesthesia via P2Y12 receptor. The present study largely reproduces those findings and does so using an impressive array of techniques and clever approaches. Following the serendipitous discovery that microglia-depleted mice exhibit increased LORR and decreased RORR, the authors go on to demonstrate that microglia regulate neuronal activity in a region-specific manner during anesthesia via purinergic receptor-mediated calcium signaling. The manuscript is well written and the data are convincing, elegantly validated using several different methods and controls, and largely complete. Nevertheless, this Reviewer has a few minor comments and suggestions to further strengthen the manuscript.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Impressive number of genetic mouse models, techniques, controls, and methods of validation.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Some of the novelty of these findings may be reduced based on the recent publication of a similar study.</p>

<p>In this manuscript, He et al. have found that delayed anesthesia induction and early anesthesia emergence were observed in microglia-depleted mice. They also showed that neuronal activities were differentially regulated by microglia depletion, possibly via suppressing the neuronal network of anesthesia-activated brain regions and activating emergence-activated brain regions. Mechanistically, this influence was found to be dependent on the activation of microglial P2Y12 receptors and subsequent calcium influx. These findings contribute to a better understanding of the role microglia play in regulating anesthesia and shed light on the underlying mechanisms involved. Nonetheless, there are still some aspects that require further investigation and clarification.</p>
<p>1. In Figure 3A the authors used IBA1 to represent microglia, and the corresponding description is 'brain microglia were not influenced'. However, IBA1 is not a specific biomarker for brain resident microglia. It's recommended to use other biomarkers, such as TMEM119 and P2RY12 to better examine the efficiency of microglial depletion.</p>
<p>
2. In Figure 7, 8 and 9 the authors stated that they aim to investigate the impacts microglia exert on neuronal activity. However, using only c-Fos is not sufficient to represent neuron. The authors are supposed to combine c-Fos with other specific biomarkers for neuron to better validate their conclusions.</p>
<p>
3. In Figure 11 the authors use C1qa-/- transgenic mice and draw the conclusion 'microglia mediated anesthesia modulation does not result from spine pruning'. However, as C1q contains multiple subtypes, I have some reservations regarding whether the authors' conclusion is entirely warranted based solely on the knockout of a single subtype of C1q.</p>
<p>
4. In Figure 14E the authors showed that expression levels of Stim1 is significantly down-regulated in CX3CR1CreER::STIM1fl/fl mouse brains. While this is not incorrect, I would suggest the authors sort microglia with FACS or MACS to perform q-RT-PCR and examine the expression levels of Stim1 since the Cre-LoxP system here is microglia specific.</p>
<p>
5. The flow of the manuscript should have been improved. For instance, the results of repopulated microglia in Figure 1B was described even after Figure 2 and 3, which makes the manuscript a little confusing. Additionally, in Figure 14, it would be beneficial to provide a more comprehensive introduction to molecules such as hM3Dq and Stim1 to improve the clarity and readability of the result descriptions.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
This work aims to understand the contribution of microglia to anesthesia induced by general anesthetics. The authors report that ablation of microglia shortens anesthesia, manifested by the delay of anesthesia induction and the early anesthesia emergence. They show that microglial depletion suppresses activity in the neuronal network of anesthesia-activated brain regions but enhances activity in emergence-activated brain regions. Based on these findings, the authors suggest microglia facilitate and stabilize the anesthesia status. To elucidate the underlying mechanism, they further tested the potential contribution of microglia-mediated dendritic spine plasticity and microglial P2Y12-Ca2+ signaling, and identified the latter as a critical pathway through which microglia regulate anesthesia.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
A major strength of this study is the systematic experimental design, which includes multiple anesthetics and complementary approaches, leading to very compelling data. As a result, a significant contribution of microglia in instating and maintaining the state of anesthesia is convincingly established. In addition, the results also shed light on the potential underlying microglial mechanistic. The findings are of relevance to both medical practice and basic understanding of microglial biology and neuron-glia interactions.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
The study produces a large amount of data that is in general cohesive and support the main conclusions, but more thorough considerations on some of their findings may be helpful, as exemplified by the following:</p>
<p>1. the effect of microglial ablation on chloral hydrate-induced RORR in Fig. 1B appears to be not the same as other anesthetics. what does this mean?</p>
<p>2. Macrophage ablation impedes anesthesia emergence from pentobarbital (Fig. 3C). how may this occur?</p>
<p>3. examination of the potential effect of microglial depletion on dendritic spine density is interesting but the experimental design does not seem to align well with the PPR and eEPSC data, which indicate a reduction in presynaptic release (Fig.10E) and increase of postsynaptic function (Fig. 10H), respectively. The PPR data seems to suggest a presynaptic effect of microglia; ablation.</p>

<p>This reviewer may confused the brain regions between our spine quantification (Figure 11) and patch-clamp recording (Figure 10). In our spine quantification, all evaluations were conducted in the mPFC. However, the patch-clamp recording were performed in SON (Figure 10 B-F) and LC (Figure 10 G-K), different brain regions from our spine quantification. As one of our conclusion, microglia differentially modulate the activity of neuronal network in a brain region-specific manner, neurons in different brain regions may exhibit different electrophysiological alterations upon microglial depletion. Therefore, this comment might be a factual error.</p>
