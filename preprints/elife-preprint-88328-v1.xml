<title>Abstract</title><p>The α-arrestins form a large family of evolutionally conserved modulators that control diverse signaling pathways, including both G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR-) mediated and non-GPCR mediated pathways, across eukaryotes. However, unlike β-arrestins, only a few α-arrestin targets and functions have been characterized. Here, using affinity purification and mass spectrometry, we constructed interactomes for six human and twelve <italic>Drosophila</italic> α arrestins. The resulting high-confidence interactomes comprised 307 and 467 prey proteins in human and <italic>Drosophila</italic>, respectively. A comparative analysis of these interactomes predicted not only conserved binding partners, such as motor proteins, proteases, ubiquitin ligases, RNA splicing factors, and GTPase-activating proteins, but also those specific to mammals, such as histone modifiers and the subunits of V-type ATPase. Given the manifestation of the interaction between the human α-arrestin, TXNIP, and the histone-modifying enzymes, including HDAC2, we undertook a global analysis of transcription signals and chromatin structures that were affected by TXNIP knockdown. We found that TXNIP activated targets by blocking HDAC2 recruitment to targets, a result that was validated by chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. Additionally, the interactome for an uncharacterized human α- arrestin ARRDC5 uncovered multiple components in the V-type ATPase, which plays a key role in bone resorption by osteoclasts. Our study presents conserved and species-specific protein-protein interaction maps for α-arrestins, which provide a valuable resource for interrogating their cellular functions for both basic and clinical research.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The discovery of first arrestin protein in retinal rods contributed to a deeper understanding of photoreceptor signaling mediated by rhodopsin, which is one of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) class. As its ability to arrest the GPCR signaling pathway, the protein was first named as “arrestin” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Kuhn, Hall, &amp; Wilden, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">Wilden, Wust, Weyand, &amp; Kuhn, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c97">Zuckerman &amp; Cheasty, 1986</xref>). Shortly after this discovery of the first arrestin protein in the retina, another arrestin protein that specifically turns off β-adrenergic signaling was identified and named “β-arrestin”. This arrestin-mediated termination of signaling from GPCRs is called “receptor desensitization” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Benovic, DeBlasi, Stone, Caron, &amp; Lefkowitz, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Lohse, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Shenoy &amp; Lefkowitz, 2011</xref>), one of crucial cellular process in maintaining cellular homeostasis and preventing overstimulation of signaling pathways. Further studies have revealed that β-arrestins regulate the receptor desensitization of other signaling pathways through ubiquitination and regulation of trafficking of various cargo molecules (Y. M. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Kim &amp; Benovic, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Malik &amp; Marchese, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Puca &amp; Brou, 2014</xref>).</p>
<p>Another class of arrestin, α-arrestin, was first studied in fungi and yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Andoh, Hirata, &amp; Kikuchi, 2002</xref>) and subsequently recognized as new class of arrestins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Boase &amp; Kelly, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Herranz et al., 2005</xref>). They contain characteristic arrestin domains, arrestin_N and arrestin_C, and PPXY motifs, which are unique to the α-arrestin clan. A phylogenetic study of arrestin proteins showed that α-arrestins are the ancestral class of the arrestin family and conserved from yeast to human (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Alvarez, 2008</xref>). To date, six α-arrestins, arrestin domain containing protein 1 (ARRDC1), ARRDC2, ARRDC3, ARRDC4, ARRDC5, and thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXNIP), have been found to be in the human genome. These human α-arrestins were first studied in conjunction with β-arrestins in the regulation of the β2-adrenergic receptor (β2AR) in human cells. ARRDC3 and ARRDC4 works as an adaptor protein for the ubiquitination of β2AR by recruiting the NEDD4 protein, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, through its conserved PPXY motifs(S. O. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Han, Kommaddi, &amp; Shenoy, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Nabhan, Pan, &amp; Lu, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Shea, Rowell, Li, Chang, &amp; Alvarez, 2012</xref>).In addition to their β2AR-associated roles, α- arrestins are involved in trafficking and sorting of other GPCRs and signaling molecules through post-translational modifications, including ubiquitination. For example, ARRDC1 and ARRDC3 were reported to play roles in the degradation of the Notch receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Puca &amp; Brou, 2014</xref>) and in the ubiquitination of ALG-2-interacting protein X (ALIX) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Dores, Lin, N, Mendez, &amp; Trejo, 2015</xref>). ARRDC1 contains a PSPA motif, which binds the tumor susceptibility gene 101 (TSG101) protein, an essential component of an endosomal sorting complex. ARRDC1 also recruits E3 ligases, such as WW domain-containing E3 ubiquitin protein ligase2 (WWP2), inducing ubiquitination of itself and the subsequent release of ARRDC1-associated microvesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Nabhan, Hu, Oh, Cohen, &amp; Lu, 2012</xref>). Another well-known α-arrestin, TXNIP, was first named as vitamin D3-upregulated protein 1 (VDUP1) after verification that its gene is a vitamin D3 target in cancer cells (K. S. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Chen &amp; DeLuca, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Qayyum, Haseeb, Kim, &amp; Choi, 2021</xref>). Since then, TXNIP had been reported to directly interact with thioredoxin, which is an essential component of the cellular redox system, to inhibit its activity as an antioxidant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Junn et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Nishiyama et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Patwari, Higgins, Chutkow, Yoshioka, &amp; Lee, 2006</xref>). TXNIP was also reported to inhibit glucose uptake by inducing the internalization of glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) through clathrin-mediated endocytosis and by indirectly reducing GLUT1 RNA levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">Wu et al., 2013</xref>). Although the TXNIP is known to be localized in both cytoplasm and nucleus, biological functions of TXNIP have been mostly explored in cytoplasm but remained poorly characterized in nucleus.</p>
<p>A few α-arrestins appear to have evolutionarily conserved functions in both human and invertebrates. For instance, the Hippo signaling pathway, which impacts a variety of cellular processes such as metabolism, development, and tumor progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Mo, Park, &amp; Guan, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Pei et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Schutte et al., 2014</xref>; Y. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">Wang et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c95">Zhi, Zhao, Zhou, Liu, &amp; Chen, 2012</xref>), was shown to be regulated by α-arrestin in both <italic>Drosophila</italic> (Y. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Kwon et al., 2013</xref>) and human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">Xiao et al., 2018</xref>). In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, the protein Leash was identified as an α-arrestin and shown to down-regulate Yki by promoting its lysosomal degradation, leading to a restriction in growth (Y. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Kwon et al., 2013</xref>). In human cells, ARRDC1 and ARRDC3 were shown to induce degradation of the mammalian homolog of Yki, YAP1, by recruiting the E3 ubiquitin ligase ITCH in renal cell carcinoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">Xiao et al., 2018</xref>), suggesting functional homology between human and <italic>Drosophila</italic>. However, because the α-arrestins interact with multiple targets, an unbiased, comparative analysis of interactome is required to determine whether other α-arrestin from human and <italic>Drosophila</italic> have common and specific interacting partners, which will determine their functional homology and diversification.</p>
<p>A comprehensive understanding of their protein-protein interactions (PPIs) and interactomes will shed light on the underlying molecular mechanisms, reveal novel regulatory axes, and enable the identification of previously unrecognized roles of α-arrestin in cellular processes. Furthermore, extensive characterization of the α-arrestin interactome may help uncover potential therapeutic targets and provide valuable insights into the treatment of diseases associated with dysregulated signaling pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Diaz et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Lu, Simin, Khan, &amp; Mercurio, 2008</xref>; Q. Y. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">Wang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c96">Zhou, Tardivel, Thorens, Choi, &amp; Tschopp, 2010</xref>)</p>
<p>In this study, we conducted affinity purification/mass spectrometry (AP/MS) of six human and twelve <italic>Drosophila</italic> α-arrestins. A high-confidence PPI network was constructed by selecting a cut-off for receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves of Significance Analysis of INTeractome express (SAINTexpress) scores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Teo et al., 2014</xref>). The constructed interactomes were validated using known affinities between domains of prey proteins and the short linear motifs of α-arrestins. We also investigated orthologous relationships between binding partners from human and <italic>Drosophila</italic> and found that many proteins with both known and novel functions could be conserved between two species. Finally, we performed experiments to provide new insights into the functions of TXNIP and ARRDC5 that were revealed in our study. Together, our results provide a valuable resource that describes the PPI network for α-arrestins in both human and <italic>Drosophila</italic> and suggest novel regulatory axes of α-arrestins.</p>

<p>Genome-scale sets of prey proteins interacting with α-arrestins (referred to herein as ‘interactomes’) were compiled by conducting AP/MS for six human and twelve <italic>Drosophila</italic> α- arrestin proteins (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>; Table S1). Proteins possibly interacting with α-arrestins were pulled down from total cell lysates of human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) and S2R+ cells stably expressing GFP-tagged α-arrestins (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>; <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1</xref>). All α-arrestin experiments were replicated twice, and negative control experiments were conducted multiple times. In total, 3,243 and 2,889 prey proteins involved in 9,908 and 13,073 PPIs with human and <italic>Drosophila</italic> α-arrestins, respectively, were initially detected through AP/MS (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>; Table S2).</p>

<p>To build high-confidence interactomes of α-arrestin family proteins, a probabilistic score for individual PPIs was estimated using SAINTexpress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Teo et al., 2014</xref>) and an optimal cutoff for the scores was set using positive and negative PPIs of α-arrestin from public databases and the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Colland et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Dotimas et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Draheim et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Mellacheruvu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Nabhan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Nishinaka et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Puca &amp; Brou, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Szklarczyk et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">Warde-Farley et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">Wu et al., 2013</xref>) (Tables S2). The resulting ROC curves showed high area under curve (AUC) values and the SAINTexpress scores at which the false discovery rate (FDR) was 0.01 were selected as cutoffs (0.85 for human and 0.88 for <italic>Drosophila,</italic> <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). Given the cutoffs, 1,306 and 1,732 PPIs involving 902 and 1,732 proteins were selected for human and <italic>Drosophila</italic>, respectively. Because proteins of low abundance (low spectral counts) are easily affected by a stochastic process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Lundgren, Hwang, Wu, &amp; Han, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Old et al., 2005</xref>), the minimum spectral count of PPIs was set at 6, allowing us to select PPIs with higher confidence. In fact, the spectral counts of the filtered PPIs were highly reproducible between replicates (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2A</xref>; Pearson’s correlations, 0.91 for human; 0.89 for <italic>Drosophila</italic>) and principal component analysis based on log<sub>2</sub> spectral counts also confirmed a high reproducibility between replicates (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2B</xref>). Moreover, we successfully detected many known interaction partners of α-arrestins such as NEDD4, WWP2, WWP1, ITCH and TSG101, which have been previously reported in the literature and PPI databases (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2C</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Colland et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Dotimas et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Draheim et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Mellacheruvu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Nabhan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Nishinaka et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Puca &amp; Brou, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Szklarczyk et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">Warde-Farley et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">Wu et al., 2013</xref>). Finally, our filtered interactomes of human and <italic>Drosophila</italic> α-arrestins, comprised of 390 PPIs between six α- arrestins and 307 prey proteins in human, and 740 PPIs between twelve α-arrestins and 467 prey proteins in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, are hereafter referred to as ‘high-confidence PPIs’ (Table S3).</p>

<p>To validify our high-confidence PPIs, we sought to analyze known short-linear motifs in α-arrestins, which are commonly 3-15 stretches of amino acids that are known to participate in interactions with other protein domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Dinkel et al., 2015</xref>). Utilizing the known affinities between short linear motifs in α-arrestins and protein domains in interactomes from eukaryotic linear motif (ELM) database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Dinkel et al., 2015</xref>), we evaluated whether our high-confidence PPIs could be explained by the known affinities between them (Table S4). The fractions of our high-confidence PPIs (green, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref> top), supported by the known affinities were significantly greater than those of all raw PPIs (red, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref> top) in both species (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 9.37 X 10<sup>-11</sup> for human and <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.0012 for <italic>Drosophila</italic>, one-sided Fisher’s exact test, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref> top). One of the most well-known short-linear motifs in α-arrestin is PPxY, which is reported to bind with high affinity to the WW domain found in various proteins, including ubiquitin ligases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Macias et al., 1996</xref>). Our analysis revealed the specific enrichment of WW domain-containing proteins in the interactomes of α-arrestins with at least one PPxY motif but not in that of the human α-arrestin (ARRDC5) without a PPxY motif (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>, bottom-left). The interactomes of five out of the eight <italic>Drosophila</italic> α-arrestins with a PPxY motif were enriched for WW domain containing proteins, but there was no such enrichment for any of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> α-arrestins without a PPxY motif (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>, bottom-right). In conclusion, a considerable portion of the high-confidence PPIs identified in this study can be evident by known affinities between short linear motifs and protein domains.</p>
<p>Next, we conducted enrichment analyses of proteins domains among interactome of each arrestin to investigate known and novel protein domains commonly or specifically interacting with α-arrestins (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figure S3A</xref>; Table S5). The most prominent interacting domains in both species were the Homologous to E6AP C-terminus (HECT), WW, and C2 domains (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">FigureS3A</xref>; Table S5). HECT and C3 domains are well known to be embedded in the E3 ubiquitin ligases such as NEDD4, HECW2, and ITCH along with WW domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">Weber, Polo, &amp; Maspero, 2019</xref>) and as we observed strong preference of WW domains to PPxY containing proteins (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>), these domains were significantly enriched in binding proteins of α- arrestins with PPxY motif in human and <italic>Drosophila</italic> (FDR &lt; 0.033 ∼ 1.23 X 10<sup>-11</sup> for human; FDR &lt; 0.045 ∼ 4.10 X 10<sup>-6</sup> for <italic>Drosophila</italic>, <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figure S3A</xref> ; Table S5). Other common protein domains involved in the protein degradation process, such as proteasome domains, were also significantly enriched in the interactomes (of ARRDC4 in human and Leash in <italic>Drosophila</italic>) in both species (FDR &lt; 6.41 X 10<sup>-4</sup> for human and FDR &lt; 1.30 X 10<sup>-5</sup> for <italic>Drosophila,</italic> <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figure S3A</xref> ; Table S5). Interestingly, some α-arrestins (ARRDC3 in human and Vdup1, Leash, and CG18746 in <italic>Drosophila</italic>) appeared to interact in common with RNA binding domains, such as DEAD box, helicase, WD40, and RNA recognition motif, but others did not. In addition, the cargo and motor protein domains IBN_N (FDR &lt; 0.0076 for human and FDR &lt; 2.50 X 10<sup>-4</sup> ∼ 2.11 X 10<sup>-6</sup> for <italic>Drosophila</italic>) and myosin_head (FDR &lt; 0.033 for human and FDR &lt; 2.11 X 10<sup>-</sup> <sup>6</sup> for <italic>Drosophila</italic>) also interacted with several α-arrestins in common (ARRDC4 in human and CG1105, CG18745, and CG18748 in <italic>Drosophila,</italic> <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figure S3A</xref>; Table S5). These enriched domains explain the conserved interactomes associated with RNA splicing and protein transport in both species. In addition, human α-arrestins seem to interact with human-specific domains, such as PDZ, Rho-GEF, MCM, laminin, zinc finger, and BAG6 domains, providing an expanded interactome of human α-arrestins (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figure S3A</xref>; domains in black), indicating the presence of both conserved and specific protein domains interacting with α-arrestins.</p>

<title>Expanded functional signatures of α-arrestin interactomes</title>
<p>Because the functions of α-arrestins can be inferred based on their binding partners, the prey proteins were grouped based on their interactions with α-arrestins, which revealed specialized functions of the respective α-arrestins with some redundancy as well as both known and novel functions (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>). The analysis of protein class enrichment by the PANTHER classification system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Thomas et al., 2003</xref>) revealed previously reported functions, such as ‘Ubiquitin ligase’ (FDR &lt; 0.0019 and 5.01 X 10<sup>-7</sup> for human; Benjamini-Hochberg correction) and ‘Protease’ (FDR &lt; 1.93 X 10<sup>-6</sup> for human and 5.02 X 10<sup>-6</sup> for <italic>Drosophila</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Dores et al., 2015</xref>; Y. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Kwon et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Nabhan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Puca, Chastagner, Meas-Yedid, Israel, &amp; Brou, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Rauch &amp; Martin-Serrano, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Shea et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">Xiao et al., 2018</xref>). In fact, the known binding partners, NEDD4, WWP2, WWP1, and ITCH in human and CG42797, Su(dx), Nedd4, Yki, Smurf, and HERC2 in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, are related to ubiquitin ligases and protein degradation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>; <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2C</xref>). In addition, novel biological functions of α-arrestins were uncovered. For instance, in human, prey proteins interacting with ARRDC3 displayed enrichment of ‘RNA splicing factor and helicase’ functions as well as ‘GTPase-activating proteins’, those of ARRDC4 were enriched with ‘Apolipoprotein’, and those of ARRDC5 with ‘ATP synthase’ (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>, up). Motor protein, protease, ubiquitin ligase, RNA splicing factor, and helicase were functions that were also enriched in <italic>Drosophila</italic> prey proteins (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>, bottom). Among them, the motor protein and RNA splicing, and helicase functions seemed to be novel conserved functions between human and <italic>Drosophila</italic>. The functional compositions of the interacting proteins summarized the common or highly specialized functions of α-arrestins well (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>, right panel). For example, in human, proteins that interacted with TXNIP, ARRDC2, and ARRDC4 showed similar ubiquitination and protease-related functions, whereas ARRDC3 and ARRDC5 displayed unique interactomes associated with other functions. For <italic>Drosophila</italic>, the interactomes of the [Vdup1, CG10086 and CG18744], [CG18748 and CG18747], and [CG1105 and CG14696] α-arrestin subsets each exhibited similar functional compositions, but the Leash interactome showed a distinct enrichment of ubiquitination-related and protease functions. Taken together, these results suggest that the resulting high-confidence PPIs of α-arrestins expanded the functional interactome maps of α- arrestins in both human and <italic>Drosophila</italic>.</p>

<title>Subcellular localizations of α-arrestin interactomes</title>
<p>Cellular localizations of proteins often provide valuable information of their functions and activity, but only a small number of α-arrestins are known for their preferential subcellular localization. We thus examined the subcellular localizations of the interacting proteins using the cellular component feature in Gene Ontology (GO) using DAVID (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Huang da, Sherman, &amp; Lempicki, 2009a</xref>, 2009b) (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figure S3B</xref>; Table S6). Prey proteins (246 for human and 245 for <italic>Drosophila</italic>) that were localized in at least one cellular compartment were examined. We found that prey proteins of ARRDC5 were preferentially localized in the endoplasmic reticulum and at the plasma membrane (PM) but were less often localized in the nucleus, compared to those of other human α-arrestins (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figure S3B</xref>, left). Similarly, the prey proteins of ARRDC1 and 4 were less often localized in the nucleus, instead being preferentially localized in the cytoplasm (ARRDC4) or extracellular space (ARRDC1), in agreement with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Nabhan et al., 2012</xref>; Q. Y. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">Wang et al., 2018</xref>). TXNIP seemed to preferentially interact with prey proteins in cytoplasm and nucleus (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figure S3B</xref>, left), consistent with a previous report (S. K. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Kim, Choe, &amp; Park, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Saxena, Chen, &amp; Shalev, 2010</xref>). ARRDC3, which was suggested to be localized in cytoplasm in previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Nabhan et al., 2010</xref>), appeared to interact with proteins preferentially localized in nucleus in addition to the ones in cytoplasm, implying novel functions of ARRDC3 in the nucleus. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, the localization of interacting proteins is often uncharacterized compared to human, but a preference for a localization for part of the interactomes can be observed (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figure S3B</xref>, right). Some of them are preferentially localized at the PM (CG18747), mitochondria (CG14696), peroxisome (CG14696), lysosome (CG2641), or cytoskeleton (CG18748), compared to others. However, interactomes of Leash, Vdup1, CG2641, CG18745, CG18746, and CG10086 are preferentially localized in the nucleus. Taken together, these data about the preferential localizations of interacting proteins provide evidence about the functions and activity of α-arrestins in cells.</p>

<title>Functional complexes in α-arrestin interactomes</title>
<p>The fact that protein functions are often realized in complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Hartwell, Hopfield, Leibler, &amp; Murray, 1999</xref>) urged us to search for functional complexes that extensively interact with α-arrestins. For this analysis, protein complexes that are significantly connected with each α-arrestin were examined using the COMPlex Enrichment Analysis Tool (COMPLEAT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Vinayagam et al., 2013</xref>), resulting in the detection of 99 and 18 protein complexes for human and <italic>Drosophila</italic>, respectively (Table S7). The complexes were iteratively combined with cellular components from GO (Table S7) based on the overlap coefficients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Vijaymeena &amp; Kavitha, 2016</xref>). The significance of the resulting combined complexes was then tested with the connectivity to each α-arrestin using the interquartile means (IQMs) of SAINTexpress scores compared to those from 1000 random cohorts (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05). This approach showed that 44 clustered complexes comprising 324 protein subunits were significantly interacting with six human α-arrestins (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>; Table S7) and 21 clustered complexes comprising 192 subunits were significantly interacting with <italic>Drosophila</italic> α-arrestins (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>; Table S7).</p>

<p>The two largest complexes found to interact with α-arrestins were related to protein degradation (proteasome and ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis) and RNA splicing and processing in both species (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>; Table S7). ARRDC1, 2, and 4 and TXNIP in human and Leash and CG2993 in <italic>Drosophila</italic> were found to interact with protein degradation complexes. CG2993 and CG18747 appeared to bind to a putative complex comprising NEDD4 family interacting protein 2, recently reported to be a mediator of ubiquitin ligase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Trimpert et al., 2017</xref>). On the other hand, ARRDC2, 3, and 4 in human and Leash, CG18746, Vdup1, CG10086, and CG18744 in <italic>Drosophila</italic> were found to interact with RNA splicing and processing complexes. Although the above-mentioned α-arrestins interacted in common with the two complexes described above, they were also found to bind to distinct complexes. For instance, TXNIP specifically binds to transcriptional and histone deacetylase (HDAC) complexes, ARRDC1 to axon guidance, endosomal sorting, and laminin complexes, ARRDC2 to the Set1C/COMPASS complex, ARRDC3 to transcription elongation factors and spindle assembly checkpoint and cell polarity complexes, and ARRDC4 to clathrin-coated pit and BAT3 complexes in human. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, Leash specifically binds to AP-2 adaptor and WASH complexes and CG18746 to the UTP B complex. In addition to the two largest complexes and their associated α-arrestins, ARRDC5 in human and CG2641, CG1105, CG14696, and CG18745 in <italic>Drosophila</italic> interact in common with protein transport and localization complexes. ARRDC5 is specifically associated with V-type ATPase and vacuolar protein sorting complexes in human. CG18748 and CG18747 are associated with motor protein complexes including actin, myosin, and microtubule-associated complexes in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. Taken together, the results from this analysis provide a glimpse of underexplored roles for α-arrestins in diverse cellular processes.</p>

<title>Conserved interactomes of α-arrestins</title>
<p>Given that α-arrestins are widely conserved in metazoans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">DeWire, Ahn, Lefkowitz, &amp; Shenoy, 2007</xref>), we sought to exploit the evolutionally conserved interactomes of human and <italic>Drosophila</italic> α-arrestins. For this analysis, we searched for orthologous relationships in the α- arrestin interactomes using the DRSC Integrative Ortholog Prediction Tool (DIOPT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Hu et al., 2011</xref>). Among high-confidence prey proteins, 68 in human and 64 in <italic>Drosophila</italic> were reciprocally predicted to have ortholog relationships, defining 58 orthologous prey groups (DIOPT score ≥ 2; Table S8). α-arrestins were then hierarchically clustered based on the log<sub>2</sub> transforemd mean spectral counts of these orthologous interactome, defining seven groups of α-arrestins. Orthologous prey proteins were grouped according to their shared biological function, defining nine functional groups and others of diverse functions (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>). The resulting clusters revealed PPIs that were functionally conserved. For instance, ARRDC3 in human and CG18746 in <italic>Drosophila</italic> actively interact with proteins in RNA binding and splicing groups. Leash in <italic>Drosophila</italic> appeared to interact with proteins in similar functional groups as ARRDC3 but, like ARRDC1, it also extensively interacts with members of ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis groups. In addition, ARRDC4 interacts with proteins in the motor protein and trafficking group, similar to CG18748 in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, and binds to proteins in the ubiquitin dependent proteolysis group, similar to TXNIP. Similarly, CG10086 and Vdup1, CG14696 and ARRDC5, and CG2993 and ARRDC2 appeared to have conserved interactomes between human and <italic>Drosophila</italic>.</p>
<p>The most prominent functional modules shared across both species were the ubiquitin dependent proteolysis, endosomal trafficking, and small GTPase binding modules, which are in agreement with the well-described functions of α-arrestins in membrane receptor degradation through ubiquitination and vesicle trafficking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Dores et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Nabhan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Puca et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">Xiao et al., 2018</xref>) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>). In contrast, the functional modules involving cyclin and cyclin-dependent kinase, casein kinase complex, and laminin seemed to be conserved between relatively specific sets of α-arrestins, whereas those related to motor proteins and RNA binding and splicing were more generally conserved. Taken together, the comparative analyses led us to identification of detailed, orthologous interactome maps of α- arrestins, which extend beyond the limited insights provided by sequence-based comparative analysis alone (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figure S4</xref>). Conserved roles of α-arrestins in both established and previously uncharacterized signaling pathways expand our understanding of the diverse roles of α- arrestins in cellular signaling.</p>

<title>Chromatin accessibility is globally decreased by TXNIP knock down</title>
<p>TXNIP is one of the most well-studied α-arrestins. Previous studies reported that TXNIP interacts with transcriptional repressors, such as FAZF, PLZF, and HDAC1 or HDAC3, to exert antitumor activity (S. H. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Han et al., 2003</xref>) or repress NF-kB activation (H. J. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Kwon et al., 2010</xref>). However, although such studies provided information about interactions with a few transcriptional repressors, they barely provided a systematic view of the roles of TXNIP in controlling the chromatin landscape and gene expression. In that sense, our PPI analysis first revealed that TXNIP extensively binds to chromatin remodeling complexes, such as the HDAC and histone H2B ubiquitination complexes, as well as to transcriptional complexes, such as the RNA polymerase II and transcription factor IIIc complexes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). Such PPIs indicate that TXNIP could control transcriptional and epigenetic regulators. To examine how the global epigenetic landscape is remodeled by TXNIP, we knocked down its expression in HeLa cells with a small interfering RNA (siTXNIP) and confirmed a decrease at both the RNA and protein levels (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">B</xref>). We then produced two biological replicates of ATAC- and RNA-seq experiments in HeLa cells with TXNIP depletion (Table S9) to detect differentially accessible chromatin regions (dACRs) and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>; Table S10). The replicated samples were well grouped by the siTXNIP condition in principle component spaces (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Figure S5A</xref> and <xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">B</xref>). The normalized ATAC-seq signal and the RNA level of expressed genes clearly showed the enrichment of open chromatin signals around the transcription start sites (TSSs) of genes that are actively transcribed (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Figure S5C</xref>). We detected 70,746 high confidence accessible chromatin regions (ACRs) across all samples, most of which were located in gene bodies (38.74%), followed by intergenic regions (32.03%) and promoter regions (29.23%, <xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Figure S6A</xref>). TXNIP knockdown appeared to induce a global decrease in chromatin accessibility in many genomic regions including promoters (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>). Of the high confidence ACRs, 7.38% were dACRs under TXNIP depletion; most dACRs showed reduced chromatin accessibility under this condition (dACRs(-), <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>; <xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Figure S6B</xref>). dACRs(-) were preferentially localized in gene bodies, whereas dACRs(+) were more often observed in promoter regions (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Figure S6C</xref>).</p>
<p>The global chromatin changes induced by TXNIP knockdown could impact gene expression at corresponding loci. In fact, our gene expression analysis showed that 956 genes were downregulated, and 295 genes were upregulated by TXNIP knockdown compared to the control (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>), suggesting that the global decrease in chromatin accessibility induced by TXNIP depletion would mediate the repression of gene expression. To confirm this phenomenon, we first selected sets of differentially (“Down genes” and Up genes” in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>, “Down” and “Up” in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>) and non-differentially expressed genes (“None” in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>) with at least one detectable ACR in promoter or gene body. Next, the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of accessibility changes demonstrated that the genes with a decreased RNA level (“Down”) showed significantly reduced chromatin accessibilities at promoters compared to those with no changes in the RNA level (“None”) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>; <italic>P</italic> &lt; 5.81 X 10<sup>-28</sup> for max changes; <xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Figure S6D</xref>; <italic>P</italic> &lt; 3.76 X 10<sup>-32</sup> for mean changes, Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test). In contrast, genes with increased RNA expression (“Up”) exhibited no changes in chromatin accessibility at the promoter (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>; <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.68 for max changes; <xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Figure S6D</xref>; <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.49 for mean changes, KS test), indicating that chromatin opening at promoters is necessary but not sufficient to induce gene expression. ACRs located in gene bodies also showed a similar trend: genes with a decreased RNA level (“Down”) showing decreased chromatin accessibility upon TXNIP depletion (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Figure S6E</xref>; <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.002 for max changes and <italic>P</italic> &lt; 7.68 X 10<sup>-7</sup> for mean changes, KS test), suggesting that TXNIP is likely to be a negative regulator of chromatin repressors that induce heterochromatin formation. We then used GO analysis(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Raudvere et al., 2019</xref>) to examine the biological functions of genes that exhibited decreased chromatin accessibility at their promoter and decreased RNA expression upon TXNIP knockdown (Table S11). In general, genes associated with developmental process, signaling receptor binding, cell adhesion and migration, immune response and extracellular matrix constituents appeared to be repressed upon TXNIP depletion (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4G</xref>).</p>

<title>TXNIP represses the recruitment of HDAC2 to target loci</title>
<p>Given that TXNIP knockdown led to a global reduction in chromatin accessibility with decreased transcription, we focused on identifying the potential role of the epigenetic silencer HDAC2, one of the strong binding partners of TXNIP in the AP/MS analysis, in mediating the TXNIP-dependent epigenetic and transcriptional modulation. Consistent with the AP/MS data, immunoprecipitation (IP) experiments showed that the two proteins indeed interact with each other. Furthermore, TXNIP knockdown reduced the amount of TXNIP-interacting HDAC2 protein but did not affect the HDAC2 expression level (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). To find out how the TXNIP HDAC2 interaction impacts the epigenetic and transcriptional reprogramming of target loci, we first checked whether the TXNIP-HDAC2 interaction causes cytosolic retention of HDAC2 to inhibit nuclear HDAC2-mediated global histone deacetylation. However, both the expression level and subcellular localization of HDAC2 were unaffected by a reduction in TXNIP, as confirmed by Western blot analysis using cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions as well as by an immunofluorescence assay (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref> and <xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Figure S7A</xref>), indicating that TXNIP might modulate HDAC2 activity in a different way.</p>

<p>We next asked if the transcriptional suppression of TXNIP-target genes was mediated by changes in HDAC2 recruitment to and histone acetylation of chromatin. To address this question, genes that were significantly downregulated by TXNIP knockdown and that contained at least one dACR in the promoter were selected by the following additional criteria: 1) the RNA level in normal HeLa cells is ≥ 10 TPM and 2) the total ATAC-seq read count at the promoter in siTXNIP-treated HeLa cells is reduced ≥ 1.5-fold compared to that in normal cells. Among the four TXNIP-target genes selected by the above-mentioned criteria, the expression levels of CD22 and L1CAM were significantly reduced (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05, Student’s T test, <xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Figure S7B</xref>). The two genes were further examined to determine whether the levels of HDAC2 binding signal and histone acetylation in their promoter regions were changed upon TXNIP knockdown (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>). We observed that RNA- and ATAC-seq coverages in exonic and promoter region of CD22 and L1CAM genes were clearly reduced upon TXNIP depletion (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref> top) and an analysis of chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) signals for HDAC2 and histone H3 acetylation at each dACR(-) detected in the L1CAM and CD22 promoters revealed that TXNIP knockdown increased the recruitment of HDAC2 to TXNIP-target loci, accompanied by decreased histone H3 acetylation (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref> bottom). Therefore, these results suggest that the TXNIP interaction with HDAC2 inhibits the chromatin occupancy of HDAC2 and subsequently reduces histone deacetylation to facilitate global chromatin accessibility.</p>

<title>ARRDC5 plays a role in osteoclast differentiation and function</title>
<p>Given that various subunits of the V-type ATPase interact with ARRDC5, we speculated that ARRDC5 might be involved in the function of this complex (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>). V-type ATPase plays an important role in the differentiation and function of osteoclasts, which are multinucleated cells responsible for bone resorption in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Feng et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Qin et al., 2012</xref>). Therefore, we hypothesized that ARRDC5 might be also important for osteoclast differentiation and function. To determine whether ARRDC5 affects osteoclast function, we prepared osteoclasts by infecting bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMMs) with lentivirus expressing either GFP-GFP or GFP-ARRDC5 and differentiating the cells into mature osteoclasts. After five days of differentiation, ectopic expression of GFP-ARRDC5 had significantly increased the total number of tartrate resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP)-positive multinucleated cells compared to GFP-GFP overexpression (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>). In particular, the number of TRAP-positive osteoclasts with a diameter larger than 200 μm was significantly increased by GFP-ARRDC5 overexpression (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>), suggesting that ARRDC5 expression increased osteoclast differentiation. Additionally, the area of resorption pits produced by GFP ARRDC5-expressing osteoclasts in a bone resorption pit assay was approximately 4-fold greater than that of GFP-GFP expressing osteoclasts (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>). These results imply that the ectopic expression of ARRDC5 promotes osteoclast differentiation and bone resorption activity.</p>

<p>The V-type ATPase is localized at the osteoclast PM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Toyomura et al., 2003</xref>) and its localization is disrupted by bafilomycin A1, which is shown to attenuate transport of the V-type ATPase to the membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Matsumoto &amp; Nakanishi-Matsui, 2019</xref>). We analyzed changes in V-type ATPase localization in GFP-GFP and GFP-ARRDC5 overexpressing osteoclasts. GFP signals were detected at the cell cortex when GFP-ARRDC5 was overexpressed, indicating that ARRDC5 might also localized to the osteoclast PM (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D</xref>). In addition, we detected more V-type ATPase signals at the cell cortex in the GFP-ARRDC5 overexpressing osteoclasts, and ARRDC5 and V-type ATPase were co-localized at the osteoclast membrane (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D</xref>). Notably, bafilomycin A1 treatment reduced not only the V-type ATPase signals detected at the cortex but also the GFP-ARRDC5 signals (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We constructed high-confidence interactomes of α-arrestins from human and <italic>Drosophila</italic>, comprising 307 and 467 interacting proteins, respectively. The resulting interactomes greatly expanded previously known PPIs involving α-arrestins and the majority of interactomes were first reported in this study, which needs to be validated experimentally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Tian, Kang, &amp; Benovic, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93">Zbieralski &amp; Wawrzycka, 2022</xref>). However, some known PPIs were missed in our interactomes due to low spectral counts and SAINTexpress scores, probably resulting from different cellular contexts, experimental conditions, or other factors (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2C</xref>).</p>
<p>Integrative map of protein complexes that interact with α-arrestins (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>) hint towards many aspects of α-arrestins’s biology that remain uncharacterized. For example, role of α-arrestins in the regulation of β2AR in human remained controversial. One study proposed that α-arrestins might act coordinately with β-arrestins at the early step of endocytosis, promoting ubiquitination, internalization, endosomal sorting and lysosomal degradation of activated GPCRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Shea et al., 2012</xref>). The another study, however, proposed different hypothesis suggesting that α-arrestins might act as secondary adaptor localized at endosomes to mediate endosomal sorting of cargo molecules (S. O. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Han et al., 2013</xref>). Among the protein complexes that interact with α-arrestins, we identified those related with clathrin coated pit in human and AP-2 adaptor complex in <italic>Drosopihila</italic> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). They are multimeric proteins to induce internalization of cargo molecules to mediate clathrin-mediated endocytosis, which suggests involvement of α-arrestins in early step of endocytosis.</p>
<p>Among the interacting proteins, 58 orthologous interacting groups were observed to be conserved between human and <italic>Drosophila,</italic> suggesting conserved roles <italic>of</italic> α-arrestins between two species (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). Among conserved proteins, proteins known to interact with human α-arrestins, such as NEDD4, WWP2, WWP1, and ITCH, were identified along with its orthologs in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, which are Su(dx), Nedd4, and Smurf, implying that regulatory pathway of ubiquitination-dependent proteolysis by α-arrestins is also present in invertebrate species. Besides the known conserved functions, the novel conserved functions of α-arrestins interactomes were also identified, such as RNA splicing (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). Because our protocol did not include treatment with RNase before the AP/MS, it is possible that RNA binding proteins could co-precipitate with other proteins that directly bind to α-arrestins through RNAs, and thus could be indirect binding partners. Nevertheless, other RNA binding proteins except for RNA splicing and processing factors were not enriched in our interactomes, indicating that this possibility may be not the case. Thus, it might be of interest to explore how α-arrestins are linked to RNA processing in future.</p>
<p>Some protein complexes and functional modules were found to be involved in specific cellular processes discovered in only human, suggesting that some functional roles of α- arrestins have diverged through evolution. As examples of specific cellular functions of α- arrestins, we explored the biological relevance of two interacting protein complexes: 1) the interaction between TXNIP and chromatin remodelers and 2) the interaction between ARRDC5 and the V-type ATPase complex. Given that TXNIP interacts with chromatin remodelers, such as the HDAC and histone H2B ubiquitination complexes, we speculated that chromatin structures could be affected by the interactions. Although we showed that siTXNIP treatment directed a global decrease in chromatin accessibilities and gene expression by inhibiting the binding of HDAC2 to targets, histones themselves could be also controlled by the interaction between TXNIP and the H2B ubiquitination complex. An impact of TXNIP on histone ubiquitination could strengthen the negative regulation of target loci by siTXNIP treatment. In addition, TXNIP interacts with the proteasome, which induces the degradation of binding partners (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). However, we observed that the cellular level and localization of HDAC2 were not affected by TXNIP reduction (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">B</xref>; <xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Figure S7A</xref>), meaning that the proteasome seems not to be involved in TXNIP’s influence on HDAC2; rather, TXNIP directly hinders HDAC2 recruitment to target loci.</p>
<p>Because the V-type ATPase plays a key role in osteoclast differentiation and physiology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Feng et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Qin et al., 2012</xref>), we investigated a possible role for the ARRDC5-V-type ATPase interaction in this cell type. We showed that the ectopic expression of ARRDC5 increased both the differentiation of osteoclasts into their mature form and their bone reabsorption activity. Additionally, ARRDC5 co-localized with the V-type ATPase at the PM (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>). Thus, further characterization of ARRDC5 and its interactome in osteoclasts might clarify how ARRDC5 regulates the V-type ATPase to play a role in osteoclast differentiation and function. With the results, the discovery of new binding partners and their functions of TXNIP and ARRDC5 will facilitate the further investigations to explore the novel PPIs of α-arrestins.</p>
<p>Given the plethora of PPIs uncovered in this study, we also anticipate that our study could provide insight into many disease models. In fact, despite a limited knowledge of their biology, α-arrestins have already been linked to a range of cellular processes and several major health disorders, such as diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Batista et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">Wondafrash et al., 2020</xref>), cardiovascular diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Domingues, Jolibois, Marquet de Rouge, &amp; Nivet-Antoine, 2021</xref>), neurological disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Tsubaki, Tooyama, &amp; Walker, 2020</xref>), and tumor progression (Y. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Chen et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Mohankumar et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Oka et al., 2006</xref>), making them potential therapeutic targets.

For human, additional positive PPIs were curated from the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Colland et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Dotimas et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Nabhan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Nishinaka et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Puca &amp; Brou, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">Wu et al., 2013</xref>). After these steps, 30 PPIs (21 preys) for human and 46 PPIs (17 preys) for <italic>Drosophila</italic> were considered as positive PPIs (Tables S3A and C). Proteins manually curated from the Contaminant Repository for Affinity Purification (CRAPome) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Mellacheruvu et al., 2013</xref>) were compared to those detected in our negative controls and only those that were detected in both were considered as were negative PPIs (Tables S3B and D). As a result of these steps, 1,372 PPIs (268 preys) for human and 1,246 PPIs (122 preys) for <italic>Drosophila</italic> were compiled as negative PPIs.</p>

<title>Construction of high-confidence PPI networks</title>
<p>The performance of SAINTexpress was evaluated using the positive and negative PPIs. Because there is an imbalance between positive and negative PPIs, 1000 random cohorts of negative PPIs number-matched with that of positive PPIs were generated. The average true positive and false positive rates were plotted as ROC curves over different SAINTexpress scores as a cutoff, and AUC values were calculated using the ROCR R package (version 1.0-11, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ROCR">https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ROCR</ext-link>). Based on these results, we chose an optimal cutoff for high confidence PPIs with a BFDR of 0.01, where the false positive rates were less than 3% (∼1.8 % for human and ∼2.7% for <italic>Drosophila</italic>) in both species, and the true positive rates were substantially higher (∼66.7 % for human and ∼45.7% for <italic>Drosophila</italic>).

<title>Identification of protein complexes associated with α-arrestins</title>
<p>To examine protein complexes significantly enriched in the α-arrestin interactomes, we collected known protein complexes from two databases: COMPLEAT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Vinayagam et al., 2013</xref>), which is a comprehensive resource of protein complexes built from information in the literature and predicted by orthologous relationships of proteins across species (human, <italic>Drosophila</italic>, and yeast), and the DAVID GO analysis of cellular components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Huang da et al., 2009a</xref>, 2009b) (Benjamini-Hochberg FDR ≤ 0.05) (Table S7B and E), from which bulk cellular compartments such as the nucleus, cytosol, and so on were excluded. From the COMPLEAT database, we evaluated the association of the resulting protein complexes with each α-arrestin by the complex association score, which is the IQM of SAINTexpress scores (<xref rid="eqn1" ref-type="disp-formula">Equation 1</xref>)

, where the first quartile is <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="544486v1_inline1.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> the third quartile is <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="544486v1_inline2.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula>, and <italic>N</italic> is the total number of preys in the complex. The significance of the complex association score was estimated by comparing the score to the null distribution of the scores calculated from 1,000 random complexes of input proteins. The significance was tested through the online COMPLEAT tool, and protein complexes with <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05 were selected for further analysis (Table S7A and D). Next, we iteratively combined (clustered) the pairs of protein complexes from any two databases (COMPLEAT and GO analysis of cellular components) that showed the highest overlap coefficients, <italic>Overlap(X,Y)</italic> (<xref rid="eqn2" ref-type="disp-formula">Equation 2</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Vijaymeena &amp; Kavitha, 2016</xref>), until there was no pair of complexes whose coefficients were higher than 0.5.

<alternatives><graphic xlink:href="544486v1_eqn2.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives>
</disp-formula>
From the clustered set of complexes, we manually removed those with fewer than three subunits or two PPIs. Subunits in the complexes that have no connection among themselves were also removed. Lastly, the significance of associations of the resulting complexes with each α-arrestin were tested in the same manner as done in COMPLEAT using complex association score. The resulting P values were corrected by the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure and only interactions with statistical significance (FDR &lt; 0.05) were visualized with Cytoscape v3.5.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Shannon et al., 2003</xref>) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>).</p>

<title>TXNIP knockdown in HeLa cells</title>
<p>HeLa cells (CCL-2; ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA) were cultured in complete DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin-streptomycin . Cells were cultured in an incubator at 37°C in humidified air containing 5% CO2. For siRNA-induced knockdown of TXNIP in HeLa cells, the following siRNA duplex was synthesized (Bioneer, Daejeon, South Korea): sense: 5’-GUCAGUCACUCUCAGCCAUdTdT -3’, anti-sense: 5’-AUGGCUGAGAGU GACUGACdTdT-3’. Random sequence siRNAs (AccuTarget Negative control siRNA; Bioneer), which are non-targeting siRNAs that have low sequence homology with all humans, mouse, and rat genes, were used as negative controls (siCon). 100 nM of each siRNA was transfected into 105 HeLa cells using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (#13778075, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA; Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

<title>RNA sequencing</title>
<p>For RNA-seq, total RNA was extracted using TRIzol (#15596018, Invitrogen; Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Total RNA concentration was calculated by Quant-IT RiboGreen (#R11490, Invitrogen; Thermo Fisher Scientific). To assess the integrity of the total RNA, samples are run on the TapeStation RNA screentape (#5067- 5576, Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Only high-quality RNA preparations, with RNA integrity number greater than 7.0, were used for RNA library construction. A library was independently prepared with 1ug of total RNA for each sample by Illumina TruSeq Stranded mRNA Sample Prep Kit (#RS-122-2101, Illumina, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA). The first step in the workflow involves purifying the poly-A containing mRNA molecules using poly-T-attached magnetic beads. Following purification, the mRNA is fragmented into small pieces using divalent cations under elevated temperature. The cleaved RNA fragments are copied into first strand cDNA using SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (#18064014, Invitrogen, Thermo Fisher Scientific) and random primers. This is followed by second strand cDNA synthesis using DNA Polymerase I, RNase H and dUTP. These cDNA fragments then go through an end repair process, the addition of a single ‘A’ base, and then ligation of the adapters. The products are then purified and enriched with PCR to create the final cDNA library. The libraries were quantified using KAPA Library Quantification kits (#KK4854, KAPA BIOSYSTEMS, Wilmington, MA, USA) for Illumina Sequencing platforms according to the qPCR Quantification Protocol Guide and qualified using the TapeStation D1000 ScreenTape (#5067- 5582, Agilent Technologies). Indexed libraries were then submitted to an Illumina NovaSeq 6000 (Illumina, Inc.) as the paired-end (2×100 bp) sequencing. Both library preparation and sequencing were performed by the Macrogen (Macrogen, Inc., Seoul, South Korea).</p>

The nuclei concentration was determined using Countess II Automated Cell Counter (#AMQAX1000, Thermo Fisher Scientific) and nuclei morphology was examined using microscopy. Immediately after lysis, resuspend nuclei (50,000 cells) were put in transposition reaction mix 50 μl, which consist of TED1 2.5μl and TD 17.5 μl (#20034197, Illumina, Inc.), nuclease free water 15 μl, and the nuclei resuspension (50,000 nuclei, 15 μl). The transposition reaction was incubated for 30 min at 37°C. Immediately following transposition, the products were purified using a MinElute PCR purification Kit (#28004, Qiagen). Next, transposed DNA fragments were amplified using Nextera DNA Flex kit (#20018704, Illumina, Inc.). To reduce GC and size bias in PCR, the appropriate number of cycles was determined as follows: qPCR side reaction was run, the additional number of cycles needed were calculated, liner Rn versus cycle was plotted and the cycle number that corresponds to 1/4 of maximum fluorescent intensity was determined. The remaining PCR reaction was run to the cycle number determined. Amplified library was purified and then quantified using KAPA library quantification kit (#07960255001, Roche, Basel, Switzerland) and Bioanalyzer (Agilent technologies).

Briefly, reads were mapped to the human reference genome (GRCH38/hg38) using Bowtie2 (version 2.3.4.3), and unmapped reads, duplicates, and those mapped to the mitochondrial genome were removed. Peaks were called by MACS2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c94">Zhang et al., 2008</xref>) and optimal peaks that were reproducible across pseudo replicates were used in the downstream analysis. The numbers of processed reads and peaks are summarized in Table S9.

The batch effects of the signals were corrected by the removeBatchEffect function from the limma R package (version 3.46.0) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Ritchie et al., 2015</xref>). Of the broad and narrow peaks resulting from the ENCODE ATAC-seq pipeline, the latter were used as an input to obtain consensus ACRs using the diffBind R package (version 3.0.15) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Ross-Innes et al., 2012</xref>). The dACRs were detected using the edgeR R package (version 3.32.1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Robinson et al., 2010</xref>). In total, 70,746 ACRs and 5,219 dACRs were detected in HeLa cells and are summarized in Supplementary Table S10. The genomic positions of the ACRs were annotated through the ChIPseeker R package (version 1.26.2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c92">Yu, Wang, &amp; He, 2015</xref>).

<p>Stably α-arrestin-GFP expressing HEK293 cells were cultured in a 12 well-plate with pre-sterilized round glass coverslips in each well. Cells on coverslip were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) (RT15710, Electron Microscopy Sciences, Hatfiled, PA, USA) diluted in PBS for 30 min and then washed three times with PBST (PBS supplemented with 0.2% Triton X-100) with 5 min intervals. To label the nucleus, samples were stained with DAPI (1:5000; D9542, Sigma Aldrich) in PBST supplemented with 1% BSA (A7906, Sigma Aldrich) for 1 hr at room temperature. Stained cells samples were washed three times with PBST and preserved in Vectashield (H-1000, Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA).

<title>Checking the reproducibility of spectral counts among replicates</title>
<p>If multiple proteins isoforms were detected, they were collapsed into a single gene. To avoid the divide-by-zero error, spectral counts of “0” were converted to a minimum non-zero value, “0.01”. To examine the integrity and quality of spectral counts from the AP/MS, the average correlation coefficients (Pearson) of spectral counts from α-arrestins were calculated and plotted. At each cutoff of spectra counts from 1 to 15, only the PPIs with spectral counts that were the same or higher than the cutoff for all replicates were kept and used to calculate correlation coefficients between replicates. The resulting coefficients from the α-arrestin interactomes were then averaged and plotted. At the cutoff of 6 spectral counts, saturation of average correlation coefficients was observed and chosen as an optimal cutoff to filter the PPIs. Principal component analysis (PCA) of the filtered PPIs was conducted based on spectral counts (with a pseudo count 1 added) transformed into a log<sub>2</sub> using the factoextra R package (version 1.0.7).</p>

<p>Hierarchical clustering based on log<sub>2</sub> spectral counts (pseudo count 1 added) of high confidence PPIs was conducted using the Pearson correlation as the clustering distance and Ward’s method as the clustering method. Heatmaps were visualized through the ComplexHeatmap R package (version 2.6.2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="sc6">Gu et al., 2016</xref>). Six clusters were identified for each species based on the results of hierarchical clustering; the PANTHER protein class overrepresentation test was performed for the proteins in each cluster (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="sc18">Thomas et al., 2003</xref>). False discovery rates (FDRs, Fisher’s exact test) of indicated protein classes were ≤ 0.05 for all classes except for “GTPase-activating protein” in human (FDR &lt; 0.133) and “GEFs” in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (FDR &lt; 0.109), respectively.

<title>Domain and motif analysis of bait and prey proteins</title>
<p>For human and <italic>Drosophila</italic>, respectively, 53 and 65 short linear motifs in α-arrestins were annotated using the ELM database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="sc2">Dinkel et al., 2015</xref>), and 423 and 546 protein domains in prey proteins were annotated using the Uniprot database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="sc19">UniProt Consortium, 2018</xref>) (Table S4). To test for enrichment of protein domains, we implemented the Expression Analysis Systematic Explorer (EASE) score (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="sc8">Hosack et al., 2003</xref>), which is calculated by subtracting one gene within the query domain and conducting a one-sided Fisher’s exact test. Protein domains enriched in the interactomes of each α-arrestin (Benjamini-Hochberg FDR ≤ 0.05) were plotted using the ComplexHeatmap R package (version 2.6.2). Next, to see how reliable our filtered PPIs were, we utilized information about known affinities between domains and short linear motifs from the ELM database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="sc2">Dinkel et al., 2015</xref>). Because the arrestin_N (Pfam ID : PF00339) and arrestin_C (Pfam Id : PF02752) domains in α-arrestins do not have known interactions with any of the short linear motifs in the ELM database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="sc2">Dinkel et al., 2015</xref>), only the interactions between the short linear motifs in α-arrestins and protein domains in the interactome (prey proteins) were considered in this analysis. We found that 59 out of the 390 human PPIs and 64 out of the 740 <italic>Drosophila</italic> PPIs were supported by such known affinities (Table S4). One-sided Fisher’s exact test was used to test the significance of the enrichment of the supported PPIs in the filtered PPI sets versus those in the unfiltered PPI sets (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>).</p>

<title>Subcellular localizations of bait and prey proteins</title>

From the annotations, we only utilized GO terms for 11 subcellular localizations (name of subcellular localization – GO term ID: Cytosol – GO:0005829; Plasma membrane – GO:0005886; Nucleus – GO:0005634; Mitochondrion – GO:0005739; Endoplasmic reticulum – GO:0005783; Golgi apparatus – GO:0005794; Cytoskeleton – GO:0005856; Peroxisome – GO:0005777; Lysosome – GO:0005764; Endosome – GO:0005768; Extracellular space – GO:0005615). If a protein was annotated to be localized in multiple locations, a weighted value (1/the number of multiple localizations) was assigned to each location. Finally, the relative frequencies of the subcellular localizations associated with the interacting proteins in the filtered PPIs were plotted for each α-arrestin (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figure S3B</xref>).</p>

<p>This <bold>valuable</bold> study provides a comparative interactome analysis of α-arrestin in human and Drosophila. Using <bold>convincing</bold> methodology that includes affinity purification/mass spectrometry, bioinformatic tools and experimental data in human cells, the authors identify biological roles of protein-protein interactions (PPI) involving α-arrestin in the two species. This study will serve as a broadly relevant resource for understanding the PPI network of human and Drosophila α-arrestins.</p>

<p>The study provides a complete comparative interactome analysis of α-arrestin in both humans and drosophila. The authors have presented interactomes of six humans and twelve Drosophila α-arrestins using affinity purification/mass spectrometry (AP/MS). The constructed interactomes helped to find α-arrestins binding partners through common protein motifs. The authors have used bioinformatic tools and experimental data in human cells to identify the roles of TXNIP and ARRDC5: TXNIP-HADC2 interaction and ARRDC5-V-type ATPase interaction. The study reveals the PPI network for α-arrestins and examines the functions of α-arrestins in both humans and Drosophila.</p>
<p>Comments</p>
<p>
I will like to congratulate the authors and the corresponding authors of this manuscript for bringing together such an elaborate study on α-arrestin and conducting a comparative study in drosophila and humans.</p>
<p>Introduction:</p>
<p>
The introduction provides a rationale behind why the comparison between humans and Drosophila is carried out.</p>
<p>
- Even though this is a research manuscript, including existing literature on similar comparison of α-arrestin from other articles will invite a wide readership.</p>
<p>Results:</p>
<p>
The results cover all the necessary points concluded from the experiments and computational analysis.</p>
<p>
• The authors could point out the similarity of the α-arrestin in both humans and Drosophila.</p>
<p>
• Citing the direct connecting genes from the network in the text will invite citations and a wider readership.</p>
<p>Figures:</p>
<p>
The images are elaborate and well-made.</p>
<p>
• The authors could use a direct connected gene-gene network that pointing interactions. This can be used by other readers working on the same topic and ensure reproducibility and citations.</p>
<p>
• The blot/gel images can be of higher resolution.</p>
<p>Discussion:</p>
<p>
The authors have utilized and discussed the conclusion they draw from their study. But could highlight more on ARRDCs and why it was selected out of the other arrestins. The authors have provided future work directions associated with their work.</p>
<p>Supplementary figures:</p>
<p>
The authors have a rigorous amount of work added together for the success of this manuscript.</p>

<p>In this manuscript, the authors present a novel interactome focused on human and fly alpha-arrestin family proteins and demonstrate its application in understanding the functions of these proteins. Initially, the authors employed AP/MS analysis, a popular method for mapping protein-protein interactions (PPIs) by isolating protein complexes. Through rigorous statistical and manual quality control procedures, they established two robust interactomes, consisting of 6 baits and 307 prey proteins for humans, and 12 baits and 467 prey proteins for flies. To gain insights into the gene function, the authors investigated the interactors of alpha-arrestin proteins through various functional analyses, such as gene set enrichment. Furthermore, by comparing the interactors between humans and flies, the authors described both conserved and species-specific functions of the alpha-arrestin proteins. To validate their findings, the authors performed several experimental validations for TXNIP and ARRDC5 using ATAC-seq, siRNA knockdown, and tissue staining assays. The experimental results strongly support the predicted functions of the alpha-arrestin proteins and underscore their importance.</p>

<p>Lee, Kyungtae and colleagues have discovered and mapped out alpha-arrestin interactomes in both human and Drosophila through the affinity purification/mass spectrometry and the SAINTexpress method. They found the high confident interactomes, consisting of 390 protein-protein interactions (PPIs) between six human alpha-arrestins and 307 preproteins, as well as 740 PPIs between twelve Drosophila alpha-arrestins and 467 prey proteins. To define and characterize these identified alpha-arrestin interactomes, the team employed a variety of widely recognized bioinformatics tools. These included protein domain enrichment analysis, PANTHER for protein class enrichment, DAVID for subcellular localization analysis, COMPLEAT for the identification of functional complexes, and DIOPT to identify evolutionary conserved interactomes. Through these analyses, they confirmed known alpha-arrestin interactors' role and associated functions such as ubiquitin ligase and protease. Furthermore, they found unexpected biological functions in the newly discovered interactomes, including RNA splicing and helicase, GTPase-activating proteins, ATP synthase. The authors carried out further study into the role of human TXNIP in transcription and epigenetic regulation, as well as the role of ARRDC5 in osteoclast differentiation. This study holds important value as the newly identified alpha-arrestin interactomes are likely aiding functional studies of this group of proteins. Despite the overall support from data for the paper's conclusions, certain elements related to data quantification, interpretation, and presentation demand more detailed explanation and clarification.</p>
<p>1. In Figure 1B, it is shown that human alpha-arrestins were N-GFP tagged (N-terminal) and Drosophila alpha-arrestins were C-GFP (C-terminal). However, the rationale of why the authors used different tags for human and fly proteins was not explained in the main text and methods.</p>
<p>2. In Figure 2A, there seems to be an error for labeling the GAL4p/GAL80p complex that includes NOTCH2, NOTCH1 and TSC2.</p>
<p>3. In Figure 5, given that knockdown of TXNIP did not affect the levels and nuclear localization of HDAC2, the authors suggest that TXNIP might modulate HDAC2 activity. However, the ChiP assay suggest a different model - TXNIP-HDAC2 interaction might inhibit the chromatin occupancy of HDAC2, reducing histone deacetylation and increasing global chromatin accessibly. The authors need to propose a model consistent with these sets of all data.</p>
<p>4. The authors showed that ectopic expression of ARRDC5 increased osteoclast differentiation and function. Does loss of ARDDC5 lead to defects in osteoclast function and fate determination?</p>
<p>5. From Figure 6D, the authors argued that ARRDC5 overexpression resulted in more V-ATPase signals: however, there is no quantification. Quantification of the confocal images will foster the conclusion. Also, western blots for V-ATPase proteins will provide an alternative way to determine the effects of ARRDC5.</p>
<p>6. The results from Figure 6D did not support the authors' argument that ARRDC5 might control the membrane localization of the V-ATPase, as bafilomycin is the V-ATPase inhibitor. ARRDC5 knockdown experiments will help to determine whether ARRDC5 can control the membrane localization of the V-ATPase in osteoclast.</p>
